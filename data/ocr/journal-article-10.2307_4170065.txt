<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sculptures from Mathura UNDOUBTEDLY the finest relief of the old Mathura school in the Museum collections, or, indeed, in America, is a recently acquired half- pediment, of which the two sides are represented in the accompanying illustration. The piece con- sists of a thin slab of red sandstone, carved on both sides. Fortunately the fracture has taken place a little to one side of the median line, so that the four central symbols are preserved almost intact; the missing portions must obviously have corre- sponded to those preserved, and this is taken for granted in the following description. As in the well-known rock-cut examples (Lomasa 13i cave, Barabar Hills; caitya-hall at Nasik),* the pediment preserves the outlines of wooden proto- types with arched beams. In our relief the sides of these " beams" are decorated with a repeating ornament of three varieties, the same on each side of the slab. The whole was undoubtedly fitted into stone jambs and covered by a stone lintel; the doorway thus constituted was probably the main or only entrance to a temple, which may have been entirely of stone, but was more likely of brick, with exception of the stone parts above referred to.t The exact width of the doorway, obtained by doubling the distance from the edge of the carving to the central point, was 99 centimetres, or 39 inches. The subject-matter of the reliefs occupying the spaces between the "beams " is unmistakable; we have four scenes from the life of the Buddha. Although most likely dating from a time when statues of the Buddha were already coming into use (the temple itself may have enshrined a statue, or merely an altar with symbols), the relief adheres strictly to the older method of representing the Great Events in a purely symbolic manner. Two of these events belong to the usual group of four. These are respectively the Great En- lightenment (Mahcisambodhi), represented by the Bodhi-tree with its votive garlands and enclosing railing (vedikd), and the Preaching of the First Sermon, more correctly called the Turning of the Wheel of the Law (Dharmacakra-pravartana), represented by the Dharmacakra or Wheel set up on a pillar. Beside the pillar are represented the deer, which indicate the place of the event, the Deer Park of Benares, now Sarnath; and with these are shown the ascetics who heard the teaching and became the Buddha's first followers. It will be noticed that the monastic robes of the latter are composed, as they should be, of many small pieces of cloth joined together-a detail rarely indicated in sculpture, though it occasionally survives even in Chinese Buddhist art. t The Bodhi-tree, on the other hand, is honored by a *See my H.;story of Indian and Indonesian Art (subsequently referred to as HIIA), Figs. 28, 31. tA pediment of this kind represented above the doorway of a structural temple is indicated in a relief from Mathura, HIIA.

It will be observed that the basket of flowers is made of leaves; such baskets in reliefs of the Kuaana period* are frequently shown in the hands of worshippers, and are also used as symbols of auspicious significance.T Of the two other scenes, one represents the Bowl-relic, set up on an altar and worshipped by another winged man-lion, one of an original pair symmetrically disposed; the hands are folded (anijali position) in worship. Behind the bowl, at the back of the altar, is represented the half-circle of a nimbus, with the peripheral scalloped ornament characteristic of early Kusana work. Although a nimbus of this kind is commonly associated with the anthropomorphic images, I do not recall another instance in which it appears with a symbol. The fourth item is a structural temple, honored by male and female worshippers with lotus flowers, attended by a female dwarf bearing a tray of offerings. There was, no doubt, a corresponding group on the other side of the shrine. The latter represents the Gandhakuti, or cell, in which the Buddha resided in the Jetavana garden at S'r&amp;vasti.* The temple is square in plan. At the ground level an entrance with wooden doors is clearly indi- cated, the latter evidently turning on tenons fitted into sockets in the lintel and threshold. It is also clearly shown that each leaf of the door is made of two pieces and strengthened by bands, presumably of iron. Above the main cella projects a railed gallery, within which rises the upper part of the temple, consisting of two stories, each provided with a small window, and crowned by a four- angled dome. Whether a wooden construction is to be understood, or a type of wooden origin constructed in brick or stone, can hardly be deter- mined; most likely a building of brick, with a stone door-frame and thatched roof, is intended. The relief is in any case a rather valuable addi- tion to the scanty material available in illustration of structural temples of this period. No structural temples of older than fourth or fifth century date have survived, but from this and other reliefs it is nevertheless evident that temple architecture had already, as indeed we might have expected from the references in the Epics, attained to a relatively advanced stage; and it becomes apparent that the later types must have been derived by a natural Kusana period, A. D. 50-320. tThere is a good example, represented as one of a group of the Eight Auspicious Symbols (astamangala) on a Jaina ayagapata from Mathura, now in the Lucknow Museum (Smith, V. A., lain stupa of Mathura, Pi. Vll). *Well-known representations of the Jetavana garden, showing the three residences of the Buddha, the Gandhakuti, Kosambakuti, and the Karorikuti, are found at Bharhut and Sanci. The name Gandhakuti is frequently applied to a Buddhist temple, e. g., to the great temrle at Bodhgaya. Another instance of the occurrence of a Gandhakuti (but in this case with a seated Buddha represented within it) as part of a series of life scenes, appears on the Mathura Dhruva Tila stupa base, illustrated in Smith, Jain stupa of Mathura, P1. CVII.</page><page sequence="3">XXV, 52 MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BULLETIN Buddha Early Kusana, Mathura David P. Kimball Fund Fig. 2 process of development from those which were already widely current in or before the Kusana period. Indian temple architecture cannot possibly have sprung into being suddenly, and without origins; before long, from a study on the one hand of the earliest reliefs, and on the other of early forms surviving in later structures and reliefs, it should be possible to reconstruct much of its history. The sharp angles at the ends of the spaces between the "beams" of our pediment are filled in with four-legged makaras, or crocodiles, an arrangement already met with in the Maurya period (Lomasa Rsi cave) and common to our example and to three other known examples of the type. Finally, in the spandrils are represented flying Garudas, carrying in their beaks three-headed serpents (nagas). These, too, can be paralleled elsewhere. It is noteworthy that the GaruJ4 of this type, with a parrot-like beak and long plumed tail, must certainly be reckoned amongst the ana- logues or prototypes of the later Persian Simulrgh ("roc "), the Chinese phoenix (feng), and the Indian flying monsters that carry elephants (nagas) in their claws and beak. The Museum example adds a fourth to the small number of pediment slabs of the type already known, and a second to those which are definitely Buddhist, the two others being apparently Jaina.* *The three other examples are all of Mathura origin. They are (I) a half-pediment, apparently Jaina, from the Kankali Tila, now J 555 in the Lucknow Museum (Smith, lain stupa of Mathura, Pls. XIX, XX); (2) a complete pediment, Jaina, now B 207 in the Lucknow Museum (unpublished); and (3) a half-pediment, Buddhist, now No. 1, I in the Mathura Museum (Vogel.

D. The cult image of a seated Buddha (Fig. 2) is a more substantial work in higher relief. Although the features seem to have been reworked at a later period,* the figure provides a good example of the purely Indian early Kuana type in which no trace of Gandharan plasticity can be recognized. I have elsewhere suggested, and shall attempt to prove conclusively in a forthcoming issue of the Art Bulletin, that the Mathura Buddha type is a direct development of the old Indian school, and that it owes nothing, whether in iconography or plasticity, to Hellenistic sources; and further, that it is the main basis of the Buddha image as finally evolved in the Gupta period and distributed throughout and beyond the limits of India proper.* This type, seated or standing, is characterized by the shaven head (the short curls are a middle Kusana development, and later invariably present),t spiral uwi4a (missing in our example), the right hand raised, the left elbow extended and hand clenched resting on the thigh, the clinging drapery and schematic treatment of the folds; plastically, by the fullness and solidity of the forms, prominence of the breasts, and energy of the gesture. Most of these peculiarities can be observed in the Museum figure. To right and left stand attend- ants, now headless; on the proper left, a male figure, probably a Yaksa, fly-whisk in hand, and on the right another male figure holding an object which may be a vaira, and if so, would designate Indra. Behind the head there was, no doubt, a simple circular nimbus. The pedestal, now abraded, was probably a "lion-throne," with an inscription or figures of donors on the front. The height of the figure over all, as now preserved, is 7212 centimetres, or 2812 inches. Another Buddha figure is a small standing image (Fig. 3) probably dating from the middle or latter part of the second century A. D. (middle Kuaana); the height is 1 712 centimetres, or nearly 7 inches. The robe covers both shoulders and in the fullness of its folds and concealment of the body shows some trace of the Hellenistic manner. The right hand is raised, the left holds the gathered ends of the robe. Between the feet is the remnant of what was probably intended for a seated lion, designating S'akya-sirmha, " The lion of the S'akya clan." The circular nimbus has beaded and scal- loped ornament, but is still comparatively plain. The only remarkable and unusual feature is the presence of shoulder-flames; very few other ex- amples of this peculiarity are known, and these are all Gandharan.1t Shoulder-flames, however, are typical in the case of figures of S'iva and those of Kusana kings on coins, and represent the fiery *The typical Buddha head of the early Kusana period is representcd in the Catalogue of the Indian Collections, Fart 11, Sculpture, PI. 2; 1and HIIA, Figs. 79, 83, 84, 96. *Cf. The Indian origin of the Buddha figure, J. A. 0. S., Vol. 46, 1926. tBuddhist tradition asserts that when the Buddha shore his locks " his hair was reduced to two inches in length, and curling from the right, lay close to his head. It remained that length so long as he lived, and the beard the same. There was no need at all to shave either hair or beard any more'" (Nidanakatha). This was evidently first interpreted to mean that a single short lock left on top of the head curled tightly from the right, as in the spiral usnisa'" of the early Kusana type; later, to mean that all the short hair remaining formed many separate curls covering the whole head. Inasmuch as the hair was cut with a sword while gathered together in the hand held over the head, the earlier interpretation must be regarded as the most satisfactory; it did not, however, very long survive in art. The usnisa as a cranial protuberance is only characteristically developed in connection with the short curls; in this way it appears a!ready at Bodhgaya about 100 B. C., though not in a Buddha figure (Bachhofer, L., Eine Pfeiler-Figur aus Bodhgaya, Jahrb. as. Kunst, 1925). The early Kusana spiral lock is certainly not a cranial bump. -Four examples are listed in Arch. Surv. India, Ann. Rep. 1921-22, p. 65, Pi. XXV a, and J. A. S. B, 111, 1834, p. 163; the type is also common in Central Asian frescoes (Grunwedel, Altbuddhisfische Kulf- stactten in Chinesisch-Turkestan, Figs. 339-344 and 351-354).</page><page sequence="5">XXV, 54 MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BULLETIN -p~~~~~~~~A Bodhisattva Kusana, Mathura Arthur Mason Knapp Fund Fig. 4 I~~ Toilet Scene Kusana, Mathura Thomas Oaks Rogers Fund Fig. 5 energy inherent in a royal or divine personage.* In the case of the Buddha there may be a specific reference either to the Great Miracle at Sr&amp;vasti, when flames proceeded from the upper part of his body, and streams of water from his feet,t or to the occasion when the Buddha manifested the divine fire when overcoming the naga in the fire temple of the Kasyapa heretics. On the latter occasion " the Blessed One," who is spoken of as the "perfect master of the element of fire," "converting his body into fire, sent forth flames" (Mahalvagga, 1, 1 5, 4 and 6). The square panel in countersunk relief, illustrated in Figure 4, measures 25 by 28 cm. or about 10 by 1 1 inches. It seems to represent a Bodhisattva, seated on a throne with high side panels, and sup- ported by two dwarfish recumbent yaksas; a yaksa and yaksi, each with a fly-whisk, stand behind as attendants. The position is one of greater relaxa- tion, one of the legs being pendent; but the hands are held in the same characteristic positions as those of the Buddha. The exact architectural application of the piece is doubtful. The date may be late Kusana. Another and smaller square panel (1 71 2 cm. or 7 inches square) in countersunk relief forms one face of a railing cross-bar (Fig. 5), of which the reverse bears a lotus medallion in high relief. The scene so gracefully treated is one of those toilet or genre subjects characteristic of the Mathura school. Such themes, when a complete identification can be made, are often found to illustrate some partic- ular story, usually a Jdtaka. As it stands, the relief represents a man binding a fillet on his hair, pre- paratory to tying the voluminous turban which is held on a tray in the hands of an attendant maidservant.

It may he observed that the shoulder-wings of certain other types, e. g., the Mathura Surya of Arch. Surv. Ind., Ann. Rep. 1909-10, Pl. XXVIII, may be derived from shoulder-flames; a trans- formation also known in the Mediterranean area, see Jacobsthal, Der Blitz in der orientalischen und griechischen Kunst. The fiery energy denoted by the shoulder-flames is essentially solar. In this connection it may be observed that the Babylonian solar deity Shamash, when represented anthropomorphically, has shoulder-flames (more rarely streams of water); and when symbolically, by a disk with four light rays alternating with four streams (cf. the double miracle at Sravasti). There cannot be any doubt that some elements of sun and fire worship are present in early Buddhist art. Cf. Stein, Scrindia, p. 874. tFor this double miracle at Sravasti, cf. Foucher, La'rt greco-boud- dhique du Gandhara, Vol. 1, pp. 351, 535, and Fig. 263.</page></plain_text>
