<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abstracts Ralf Becker: Anthropomorphismus (II) In general, »anthropomorphism« denotes the humanization of something that is not human itself (e.g. inanimate nature, animals, or God). The first part of the contribution (cf. AfB 49,2007) follows the history of this concept from its origins in classical antiquity up to Kant. This second part examines the continuing con ceptual history in the 19th and 20th century, commencing from German Idealism and ending with »the end of Man« proclaimed by Foucault and Lyotard. Charac teristic of the anthropomorphism discourse of the 19th century is what could be called «Critique of Concrete Reason«: Reason in its concrete manifestation is supposed to be perceived and explicated as human. It follows that every activity of Reason generates anthropomorphisms. In the 20h century, this equation of Reason and Man is criticized (e.g. by Husserl). On the other hand, the origin of humanization, Man itself, becomes the focus of anthropology and anthropology critique. In a well understood sense, Man itself can be seen as an anthropomor phism, namely as the result of the self-humanization of a being that continually searches for its own essence. Pierpaolo Ciccarelli: Zum Begriff des Naturrechts bei Leibniz The paper is aimed to show the specific critical meaning of the concept of ius na turelle that Leibniz delineates in a critical essay on Pufendorf's theory of natural justice published in 1706. Leibniz's criticism of Pufendorf has an »exoteric« cha racter and follows a »protreptic« aim. First, Leibniz discusses Pufendorf s theory starting from representations of the common sense based on the authority of the revealed religion. Nevertheless, Leibniz's final aim is not to justify the religious authority but, on the contrary, to show the radical antithesis between ratio and auctoritas in order to urge the reader to adopt a rational attitude. The opposition of ratio vs. auctoritas, e.g. free rational mindset vs. forced submission, is also the leading thread of Leibniz's essay. Pufendorf's doctrine of natural justice does not aknowledge this principled alternative. Moreover, the above-mentioned op position marks the argument of Leibniz himself. Namely, Leibniz approaches the opposition ratio vs. auctoritas from two very different points of view. At first, he points it out from the perspective of those who are submitted to that autho rity. Then, he discusses the opposition in a strict rational way by showing that Pufendorf's theory is self-defeating. Therefore Leibniz's rational demonstration is a kind of Aristotelian elenchos or »refutation«: through the prove of the self contradiction in the discussed thesis the opposite point of view is proved.

Die Epistemologie des Damaskios und das Begriffsfeld der γνώσις zwischen Spekulation und Skepsis The philosophical thought of Damascius (about 456-540), the last head of the Piatonic Academy, forms also the last original spéculative System of ancient neoplatonism. Within his sceptical metaphysics the reflections on the essence, on the principles, on the possibilities, and on the limits of knowledge are of im mense importance and constitute a fundamental contribution to epistemology in général. Damascius works on the recognizability of the absolute, the one, and the being. He distinguishes - on the basis of his theory, that between the levels of reality exists a necessary, irreversible, and non-reciprocal progression of dif férence - in an innovative terminology between recognizable and recognized object, between intended and realized object of knowledge, between being, phenomenon and subjective perspectives on the phenomenon. He makes the pioneering distinction between the formal and the material aspect of the object of Cognition; and Damascius investigates the différence between the being it self and the being's relations to the other. Not only his detailed distinctions but also his formation of new concepts, contents and their intégration in neoplatonic henology, ontology, and theory of causation make Damascius an outstanding figure in the history of philosophy. Eva-Maria Engelen: Eine kurze Geschichte von &gt;Zorn&lt; und &gt;Scham&lt; &gt;Anger&lt; and &gt;shame&lt; are exemplary émotions in the ancient reflections concer ning the relation between émotions, the good and the just as well as the relation between émotions and reason. It is shown that these émotions have a regulative function for the Community in the ancient world. But they have also quite an important function for becoming an autonomous seif and even for the change in character of a self. It is then shown in interpreting the notions of anger and shame in Augustine's writings in how far this changes for late antiquity. Emo tions have still a function in relation to the just but only a marginal one to the good, and none for the developing of a self or for reasonable actions. They also do regain a cognitive function in the Middle Ages as is shown in an exemplary way in Thomas Aquinas' writings on émotions, the function they had in relation to the just is of no great importance anymore. It is then interesting to see that also a theory of émotions, as Thomas Aquinas developed is a theory that might be compared with modem théories of émotions, one has to look back to the an cient reflections on shame and the good in order to understand more fully what an author like Imre Kertész being a survivor of German concentration camps writes on shame and the good in his novels.</page><page sequence="3">Abstracts 273 Dimitri Ginev: Georg Mischs Umformulierung des Begriffs der transzenden talen Logik In this paper I try to establish three Claims. First, I try to identify the distance from Dilthey's psychologism taken by Georg Misch in his hermeneutic refor mulation of the philosophy of life. Secondly, I try to argue that the outcome of Misch's criticism of transcendental and hermeneutic phenomenology is the intégration of a certain paradigm of constitutional analysis in the philosophy of life. Finally, I try to show that Misch's project for a hermeneutic logic is quite relevant to the process of conceptual construction in the human sciences. It is my contention that the common of denominator of the antipsychologist orientation, the élaboration on a constitutional theory, and the development of a hermeneu tic logic is Misch's critical réception of Kant's transcendental logic. Martin F. Meyer. Der Wandel des Psyche-Begriffs im frühgriechischen Denken von Homer bis Heraklit The article argues that the concept of psyché underwent fundamental changes in early Greek thought. The development can be outlined by distinguishing five steps. (1) In Homer there is absolutely no evidence for psyché being a principle neither of life nor of mind functions. The appearance of psyché, i.e. its coming out of the dying body, is caused by human death. There is no indication that psy ché has existed in the body before. Psyche functions as an individual Substitute (ιeidolon) for the deceasing person. (2) In early archaic lyrics life and psyché became more synonymous. (3) In early Milesian thinking a wider connotation of psyché can be detected. Psyche is now understood as an overall principle of movement. It becomes a matter of philosophical spéculation on what material psyché consists of. (4) According to Pythagoras, psyché is something immortal being able to transmigrate from one living entity to another. This has two sig nificant conséquences: Firstly, psyché becomes the principle of ail living things. Henceforth ail living entities are understood as homogeneous qua psyché and therefore labelled as empsycha. Secondly, psyché is understood for the first time as an internai principle - the later so-called soul. The concept of an immortal soul evokes a new ethical approach: Man has to care for his soul by keeping it clean and unpolluted. (5) Heraclitus expands this concept. He assumes psyché has a growing logos. He stresses the enormous spectrum (of the notion) of psy ché to express that the soul has a complex structure, which is difficult but not im possible to explain. Heraclitus's conception can be interpreted as the beginning of psychology or a philosophy of the mind.</page><page sequence="4">274 Abstracts Esther Ramharter: Über das Verhältnis von Epagoge und Galle bei Aristoteles This paper pursues two objects which are partially interfering: (1) to study the relation between the différent définitions of both παράδειγμα and έπαγωγή gi ven by Aristotle in Topics, Rhetorics, and Analytica Priora, (2) to clarify the relation between the définition of έπαγωγή and the example Aristotle offers in Analytica Priora. Both the corresponding définitions in relation to each other and the définition in relation to the example show some incompatibilities. The problems concerning the définitions may be solved by understanding them as adapted to the context; whereas I suppose the déviation of the example from the définition to be simply a mistake. (The paper does not elaborate the epistemic, but the formal status of παράδειγμα and έπαγωγή.) Martin Reisigl: Stereotyp. Ein ambiges Konzept zwischen verfestigter Denkökono mie, sprachlichem Schematismus und gefährlicher Handlungsdetermination (I) The concept of &gt;stereotype&lt; is used in a variety of disciplines with changing meanings. They intersect - up to synonymity - with neighboring notions such as &gt;prejudice&lt;, &gt;cliché&lt;, &gt;image&lt;, &gt;phrase&lt;, &gt;common place&lt; and &gt;prototype&lt;. Stereo types are related to semantic features such as stenciled simplification, gene ralization and caricaturing, biased presumption, far-reaching inflexibility as well as independence of experience, habitualisation and emotionally tinted évaluations. They are usually located in the area of preconceptional Cognition, but sometimes (especially within linguistics) on the level of semiotic and especially linguistic manifestation. Their ambiguous functional status oscillâtes among apperceptive economy, linguistic schematizing and the (dangerous) coining of prédispositions to act. All this is exposed in detail in the présent article after the reconstruction of the linguistic history of the term. Gisela Schlüter: Materialien zu einem Libro della discrezione. Zur historischen Semantik von &gt;discrétion&lt; im Sprachvergleich The history of the concept of &gt;discretion&lt; has not yet been written. This lacuna may be due to the complexity of the historical semantics of &gt;discretion&lt;, the variety of its synonyms, antonyms, derivatives and Compounds. Furthermore, there are significant différences in what &gt;discretion&lt; means and has meant up to now in Romance languages, in English and in German. Proceeding from the rieh semantics of &gt;discernere&lt; / &gt;discretio&lt; in late Latin, the présent study focusses on the semantical differentiation and multidiseiplinarity today in Romance languages as well as in German and in English. It is only since the 18th and 19th centuries that &gt;discretion&lt; normally means tact and secrecy. Beyond the patristical (theological), scholastical (logical), the mathematical and technical and a juridical sense of</page><page sequence="5">Abstracts 275 &gt;discretion&lt;, this essay concentrâtes on the philosophical and epistemological meanings of the term (designating the faculty of discernement, prudence, sound judgment, précisé perception). Düring the Italian Renaissance, &gt;discrezione&lt; had become a key word of an empirically based epistemology. Hegel, in his Phänomenologie des Geistes, quite surprisingly returns to eider meanings of &gt;discreteness&lt; as a &gt;Diskretion der Einzelnheit&lt;. Pawel Zaleski: Tocqueville on Civilian Society: A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomie Structure of Social Reality Small mistakes in the English translation appear signifïcant enough to force us to think that Tocqueville understood the term &gt;civil society&lt; in a completely différent way than his contemporaries, that is Hegel and Marx. In their works civil society as bourgeois or market society was a sphere of economic activity, &gt;system of needs&lt; fulfilling the desires of consumers through the work of producers. The causes of a wrong understanding of Tocqueville lay in a long tradition of mistakes in the English translations and in a lack in the Anglo-Saxon world of a concept of &gt;civil law Company&lt;, in French société de droit civil, in German Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts - imposed upon the whole of continental Europe by Bonaparte with his Civil Code. To get out of the semantic confusion one should assume that Tocqueville, while writing about civil(ian) associations, thought rather of business entrepreneurships than of non-governmental organizations. Tocqueville was writing about America rather in a liberal than a republican spirit.</page></plain_text>
