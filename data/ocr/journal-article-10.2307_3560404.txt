The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. By Julian Jaynes. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1977. 467 pp. $12.95. or many years the impact of science on our culture has been a cause for con- cern as well as pride. The success of its approach to the external world has di- verted attention from man's inner life; the resulting understanding of nature has destroyed the supernatural foundations of our earlier moral consensus, without providing a substitute system; and the technological applications of science are increasingly seen to have costs as well as benefits. But while these problems are disturbing, it is also disturbing to see a reaction to them that is creating wide- spread suspicion of the value of scientific research and even of rationality. For if we were to abandon science and technol- ogy, we would not solve, but would only intensify, the economic crises of our densely populated world. And if we were to reject the scientific search for objec- tive truth about nature, instead of recog- nizing the complementarity between such knowledge and value judgments, we would impair our ability to make effec- tive judgments based on reality. The Responsibilities of Speculation As a counter to this trend Sagan's book deserves praise. It portrays science as an exciting and valuable enterprise, and its focus on a Darwinian approach to the origin and nature of the human brain is a welcome corrective to current mystical approaches. The book's popu- larity is not surprising. Not only is Sagan a celebrity, through his association with exobiology and his television appear- ances, he also writes with clarity and charm. In addition, a wealth of imagery, a range of associations, and a variety of literary and philosophical quotations in- crease the book's readability for non- scientists. Unfortunately, despite these virtues, the book is seriously flawed. It lacks, both in what it contains and in what it omits, the high degree of rigor and re- sponsibility that Sagan's credentials as a scientists lead us to expect. Loose, naive, or scientistic statements abound: for ex- ample, that memory may be contained in particular molecules (an ambiguous, and in its most obvious interpretation an obsolete, statement); that the brain of the chimpanzee is suitably prepared for the introduction of language, though "not to quite the same degree" as that of man (not quite?); and that further in- vestigation of neocortical activity in the fetus will provide the ultimate key to the solution of the abortion debate (pace the naturalistic fallacy). Experts on neurobiology have criticized other details. But Sagan confesses to be- ing an amateur in this area, and he ad- mirably communicates his primary mes- sage about the evolutionary and the neurobiological basis for our emotions and for intelligence, and so such lapses are forgivable. I am more disturbed by his practice of inserting "I wonder" every few pages, giving the innocent reader the illusion of being in on the ground floor of a series of exciting discoveries. This practice violates a canon that every graduate student in science should learn in the course of writing his first paper: namely, that speculations are cheap. A scientist is encouraged to publish new ideas that derive from his data, or from an unusually novel insight or an ingeni- ous theoretical analysis. But he forfeits respect if he appears to offer ideas well known in the field as his own. Skimming the surface of evolution and neurobiology, Sagan comes up with many obvious and sometimes silly speculations. For example: "I wonder whether the ritual aspects of many psychotic illnesses could be the result of hyperactivity of some center in the R-complex" (p. 62); "I sometimes wonder if deodorants, par- ticularly 'feminine' deodorants, are an attempt to disguise sexual stimuli and keep our minds on something else" (p. 69). I, in turn, wonder why the author, after a quite informative chapter on the different functions of the right and the left halves of the neocortex, offers the following near-tautology: "Might schizo- phrenia be what happens when the drag- ons are no longer safely chained at night; when they break the left-hemisphere shackles and burst forth in daylight?" (p. 99). These errors of commission are irri- tating, but certain omissions are more serious. At the start the author sets a laudable goal: "A better understanding of the nature and evolution of human intelligence just possibly might help us to deal intelligently with our unknown and perilous future." But since the future begins, at each instant, with the present, we must ask: what aspects of the subject are most relevant to our present social problems, most clouded by preconcep- tions derived from a prescientific age, suffer most from misunderstanding of the limits of science? Which are most essential for a responsible scholar to face seriously? My own list would include three main areas, which Sagan ignores. First, the chapter on "Genes and Brains" gives the author a fine oppor- tunity to clarify misconceptions about gene therapy. The aim of this field (still far off) is to learn how to replace the single defective genes that are responsible for such crippling hereditary diseases as phenylketonuria and sickle cell anemia. But though this is surely an admirable goal there is wide public fear that its achievement would permit future gov- ernments to use the same techniques to blueprint personalities. In fact, however, the gap between single-gene replacement and blueprinting of personalities is enormous. Though we Hastings Center Report, April 1978 -- -- I 34</page><page sequence="2">do not know in detail how the develop- ing embryo translates genetic informa- tion into the wiring diagrams and the functional connections (synapses) of the brain, we can be sure that a very large number of genes must be involved in the process. In addition, we know that no genetic manipulations will be able to re- wire the brain after it has been formed. This information seems to be more use- ful to the public than anything else one could convey about genetics and the brain. But Sagan entirely avoids the con- troversial subject of genetic engineering. Instead, in a chapter on "The Future Evolution of the Brain" he discusses such trivia as the future surgical implantation in our brains of small computer modules that will provide fluent knowledge of exotic languages. Second, the author gives a good deal of attention to the implications of evolu- tion for our social behavior, and he speculates extensively about the behav- ioral influences of the deeper layers of our brain (the reptilian complex and the limbic system), phylogenetically in- herited from earlier vertebrates. This is the subject matter of sociobiology, a re- cently defined and controversial field that has been receiving a great deal of public as well as scientific attention. Yet the word "sociobiology" does not even appear in the book. A third omission concerns the impli- cations of evolution for human genetic diversity in behavioral traits. In recent years this diversity, and particularly the heritability of intelligence, has been the focus of intense controversy, in which questions of scientific fact have been excessively mingled with sociological concerns. This topic is surely an indis- pensable part of a serious discussion of the evolution of human intelligence. In omitting it Sagan misses an opportunity to clarify important aspects that have been eclipsed in the emotional debate. What we have, then, is a portrait of science rather like a Norman Rockwell painting-upbeat, cheerful, enthusiastic, without a wart or wrinkle, without a whiff of controversy, and with serene confidence in the future. Yet the general topic of the book-evolution and intelli- gence-presents one of the most provoc- ative intersections of science and society. In Sagan's defense, one might grant that he chooses a more cosmological per- spective. But the disappointing observa- tions that he does offer on social prob- lems suggest another conclusion: that however much his concern with hypo- thetical organisms in space has led to a deep interest in biology, it has not led to deep insights into the implications of biology for the nature of our species and for its problems on this planet. Science or Metaphor? In contrast to Sagan's surface analyses, Jaynes' book, The Origins of Conscious- ness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, appears at first sight to be a highly original, scholarly contribution. Instead it turns out to be literary fantasy with a dash of apparent evidence from neuro- biology, achieving originality at the cost of common sense. Moreover, the book does not deal with the origins of con- sciousness; it is about the cultural evolu- tion of attitudes toward consciousness. Jaynes' thesis is based on a peculiar quality, he notes, in the Iliad and the Bible: gods speak frequently to men, but there are no references to human intro- spection. From this record he concludes that consciousness did not develop until a later stage in civilization. He infers that it arose not through changes in cul- tural attitudes alone (that is, in the cul- turally generated, learned information stored in the brain) but through "neuro- logical reorganization" (p. 374) in the relations between the two cerebral hemi- spheres, dependent on the development of writing. He even speculates that there has since been evolutionary selection against people who hear voices, leaving us now with a rather small number of such people. In fact, however, our knowl- edge of population genetics shows that such rapid selection, in a few dozen hu- man generations, would be impossible. Building on this hypothetical reorgani- zation of the brain, and on the evidence of Roger Sperry and others on the func- tional differentiation of the right and the left hemispheres of the neocortex, he de- scribes poetry and music, religion, and hypnosis as vestiges of the "bicameral mind" that all people possessed a few millenia ago. Moreover, ignoring any distinction between the presumed hal- lucinations of a hero of the golden age and the incapacitating hallucinations of a modern schizophrenic, he scolds psy- chiatrists for using drugs that decrease hallucination. The overall argument is preposterous. The early poets may have invoked divine sources simply in metaphoric terms. Moreover, in an age that lacked any scientific basis for relating mind and matter, and that endowed every tree with a spirit, people could easily have also endowed their self-aware mental proc- esses with a separate identity. But neurobiology has now taught us that function is indissolubly linked with structure. Hence however little we un- derstand consciousness in neurobiolog- ical terms, it is clearly an expression of the activity of a brain with a certain complexity of structural organization. Moreover, the human brain has not in- creased in size in the past hundred thou- sand years. So even if a Homeric hero ascribed his more profound thoughts to an external, anthropomorphic source, was he not also conscious of his more ordinary thoughts and decisions-to eat a meal, to pick up a weapon? And what about the peoples who have not achieved written tradition even up to modern times? Do they lack consciousness? If this book were simply an exercise in untrammeled literary imagination one could admire the author's creativity and erudition. And some may admire his highly personal literary style. For exam- ple, "The yearning for certainty which grails the scientist, the aching beauty which harasses the artist, the sweet thorn of justice which fierces the rebel from the eases of life. ..." (pp. 8-9). But he has chosen a title that implies a focus on a real scientific problem; he is a member of the Psychology Department at Prince- ton; and he invokes many scientific sources as well as literature and history. The work, however, is in no sense a scientific contribution, popular or seri- ous. Instead its propositions are in the tradition of classical theological tracts, expressed in terms that the reader may interpret either literally or metaphoric- ally. Moreover, while the author goes through the motions of scientifically test- ing his hypotheses against reality, he ig- nores most of the reality encountered in everyday life. Hemispheres of the Brain Our present knowledge of the func- tional differences between the two halves The Hastings Center 35</page><page sequence="3">of the cerebral cortex is provocative, but still primitive. Eventually this field will shed light on human behavior, just as recognition of the evolution of the limbic system helps us to understand emotional responses and social patterns that we share with lower mammals possessing a similar structure. But if we can say at present that the right hemisphere is to some degree more involved with imagi- nation and with patterns and the left with language and logic, we must recog- nize that the correlation is loose. More- over, there are no evolutionary antece- dents to enrich our psychological in- sights, and there is no neuro-anatomical Ethical Issues in Sex Therapy and Re- search. Edited by William H. Mas- ters, M.D., Virginia E. Johnson, and Robert C. Kolodny, M.D. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1977. 227 pp. $12.50. T he symposium is for bioethics what the dialogue was for Socratic philosophy, the commentary for medieval theology, and the treatise for nineteenth-century anything. Like these other modes of dis- course, the symposium has its character- istic features that determine how and even which issues are addressed. It is a form better for raising questions and re- porting experience than for developing theories, better for filling in old territory than breaking new ground. These proceedings, Ethical Issues in Sex Therapy and Research, from a sym- posium sponsored by Masters' and John- son's Reproductive Biology Foundation, are a case in point. A number of stand- ard issues in medical ethics are clearly defined and seriously addressed, notably in Miriam Kelty's ingenious essay on confidentiality and Robert Kolodny's judicious discussion of informed consent. Ruth Macklin argues with clarity that the ethical issues presented by sex ther- evidence on individual differences in the circuitry of the two hemispheres (though they no doubt exist). Hence substitution of neuro-anatomical terms as synony- mous for familiar behavioral concepts has no predictive value and gives only the illusion of adding depth to the dis- cussion. Worse, the illusion tempts the author into excessive extrapolations, or- biting out of the range of the intellectual gravity that holds science together. BERNARD D. DAVIS, M.D., is Adele Lehman Professor of Bacterial Physiol- ogy at Harvard Medical School. apy and research are no different from those presented by any other enterprise involving professionals and clients, sub- jects or patients. In spite of the sophistication of most of the contributions, one who was puz- zled or anguished about difficult cases or conflicts between principles is likely to remain so after reading this book. For example, what is the nature of the pro- fessional obligation to the patient? Al- most all the participants say that the therapist should never impose personal values on the patient. Yet, in discussing the delicate issue of sexual relations be- tween therapist and patient (condemned absolutely by all but one or two), so much is made of transference, of patient vulnerability, and lack of self-control that one wonders: is such a person in a position to formulate and pursue goals independently? And doesn't the very process of self-examination, explicit in therapy and implicit in interview re- search, influence the attitudes of patients or subjects? Wouldn't it be more honest to concede that there will be influence on patient values and deal with that directly? Jay Katz attributes our lingering doubts on such issues to the underdevel- oped state of medical ethics, a point he illustrates by raising questions about the "simple" maxim: do no harm. Whether (as he thinks) more research would give us more agreed-on answers, or (as I think) controversy is the natural state of applied ethics is a question that needs to be addressed in a more systematic and candid way than this symposium did. In fact, the way controversy is treated in the volume leads me to wonder to what extent many of the conference speakers see their problems in political or public relations terms rather than moral or ethical ones. (Some seem not to distinguish them.) Very little doubt is expressed about the essential value of the goals of sex therapy and research; few questions are asked about the means variously adopted to achieve them (ex- cept for unprofessional ones); and it is assumed that sex therapy and research ought to be a high priority in contempo- rary society. The public, whose sensibili- ties are often outraged and moral prin- ciples flouted, is regarded as an enemy to be deceived, placated, or (if all else fails) defied. This is not to say that veterans in the field have not tried to convince the pub- lic; their many battles have left them plainly scarred and weary, as some of the accounts in this volume make clear. The graceful and good-humored reflec- tions of Emily Mudd, and of William Masters and Virginia Johnson vividly de- scribe their efforts to have sex accepted as an appropriate subject for serious re- search and then to develop effective therapies for sexual dysfunction and ade- quate funding for research. I support these goals and admire the courage and ingenuity of many in pur- suing them. Still: if treating others as ends and respecting their convictions are moral requirements and not mere in- house rules, it is arbitrary to follow them with respect to patients or subjects while manipulating les autres. To encounter and respond to the public rather than evading or manipulating it would require an enormous expenditure of time and energy for doubtful outcomes, at least in professional terms. But that must be done if the professionals in sex therapy and research want to give their endeavors a moral basis in a democratic society. -James M. Smith JAMES M.
