Reihe Ägypten 38 / Classification and Categorization in Ancient Egypt 6). XIII + 159 Seiten. ISBN 978-3-4470-5900-8. 38,00 €. The latest addition to the 'Classification and Categorization in Ancient Egypt' subseries of the Göttinger Orientforschungen is a reworked édition of the author's Magisterarbeit at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin. The introduction first présents the aims of the book, the central purpose of which is to elucidate the use of classifiers in the Pyramid Texts, with particular respect to 'mutilated' human figures. On the following pages is found a brief introduction to the theoretical framework, based to a large extent on classification studies from outside the field of Egyptology and introduced to this discipline particularly by Orly Goldwasser and Frank Kammerzell. The remainder of the introduction provides bibliographie overviews of the Pyramid Texts, Egyptological discussions of determinatives/classifiers, and especially the cross field between these two areas.</page><page sequence="2">322 Besprechungen Following the introduction, the main body of the work is divided into three parts. The first, smallest part, "Computergestützte Aufbereitung hieroglyphischer Texte", deals with the problems of codifying Egyptian texts electronically. A problem of particular magnitude when dealing with the highly diverse inventory of signs in the Pyramid Texts is that of ascribing a code in the sign list to individual variants of a particular sign. This challenge has been met by keeping sign variants separate to a large degree, thereby creating a substantial addition to the sign list reproduced here as appendix 1. The second part is entitled "Die Systematisierung der ägyptischen Klassifi katoren" and deals with the development of a conceptual framework suitable for describing and analyzing the use of classifiers. The first section of this part takes up the by now relatively well-established analysis of taxonomical hiérarchies into superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels. As a transversal axis to this hierarchical one, the author discusses next the importance of meronymical (part-whole) and metonymical (contiguity) relations along with various subtypes useful for describing relations between a lexeme and its classifier(s). As an innovation in the Egypto logical literature, the next subsection introduces a previously unpublished framework developed by Frank Kammerzell, that of semantic roles. It is suggested that classifiers, especially those classifying verbs, can be described according to semantic roles such as agent, undergoer, location etc., giving a small set of possible roles a given entity may play in an event. Each classifïer can then be analyzed as depicting (in whole or in part) one or more of these prototypical participants. After discussing and suggesting a few minor changes to the framework developed by Kammerzell, the author moves on to the special case of mutilated hieroglyphs as they can be understood within this conceptual framework. Semantic roles can account for the majority of cases, but a few exceptional examples are left that appear to exhibit a kind of lucus a non lucendo-logic, such as hqr, 'hunger' classifïed with man-with-hand-to-mouth classifïer (A2) or bread (X2). To explain these, the author introduces the notion of ffame semantics, according to which lexemes form part of frames evoking an entire experiential scénario. Referring to modem psycholinguistic experiments of word association, the author points out that test subjects often associate notions such as 'food' or 'eat' with the keyword 'hungry' because the words belong to a common frame, thus indicating a possible parallel to the Egyptian classifiers. Concluding this part, a small handful of classifiers are analysed according to the framework presented, more specifïcally [Mit Dem Mund] (A2), [Bewegung] (D54), [Gewalt/Kontrolle] (A24) and [Administratives] (Yl). The third part, "Klassifizierung in Kontext" sets up a number of hypothèses regarding the influence on classifiers by the wider or narrower contexts. Some of the hypothèses arise from the examination in the earlier parts of the book, while others have been advanced in the previous literature. The général note in this part is negative: the use of classifiers in the material examined here shows very little influence from the context. The main exceptions are personal names, where the classifïer can be changed to reflect âge, gender, status etc., and so-called secondary classifications, i.e. cases such as participles classifïed both by the verbal classifïer of the root and a sitting-man (Al) classifying the désignation of a human male.</page><page sequence="3">Ägyptologie 323 A few pages of "Zusammenfassung und Ausblick" conclude the book, which also contains two appendices, one presenting a list of anthropomorphic classifiers in the Pyramid Texts, and one reproducing an excerpt of an unpublished project report by Frank Kammerzell on the research project "Typologie und Gebrauch der ägyptischen Hieroglyphenschrift", in which he introduces the theoretical framework forming the basis of the book. The book offers much interesting material for discussion, but for the présent purposes focus will be limited to a few brief remarks on theory and method, as the présentation and Implementation of the new conceptual framework in part 2 is likely to be seen as the main contribution of the book to the fîeld of Egyptology. In most cases, the new framework for understanding the relationship between a word and its classifier based on semantic rôles is able to offer convincing and often remarkably elegant new explanations for both fréquent and more marginal phenomena. Perhaps for this reason, the author in most cases does not assign much space to the alternative théories and explanations advanced in the fîeld of classifier studies in Egyptology, a strategy which on the whole works very well. However, in a case hke the discussion of such classificatory phenomena as dnd, 'rage' classified with ci, and hntj, 'be greedy' with (pp. 53-57), the discussion would have gained by following the theory being criticized back to its origins. The great advantage of the author's analysis is that it manages to bring these otherwise somewhat exceptional usages completely in line with the général principles of verb classifiers: The classifier shows a prototypical participant in the event expressed by the verb, so the bull is a prototypical experiencer of dnd, 'rage', just as it is a prototypical undergoer of sm), 'slaughter', accounting for the use of the same classifier in both of these words. However, if one reads the original theory behind Goldwasser's suggestions criticized by the author,1 it becomes clear that some of the objections given by the author seem to rest on a misapprehension of the notion of 'ad hoc category', understood rather too literally by the author in her critique (p. 55f).2 Similarly, there is no reason a priori to assume that the hieroglyphic writing system should présent a 'neutral' view of the world, and thus it does not appear to be a weighty counterargument to object, as the author does (p. 56f), that a metaphorical understanding would entail a graphemically fixed évaluation that could not shift with the context. In fact, the association of particular acts with animal-like behavior would remain whether the classification is understood as metaphorical with Goldwasser or, following the author, the animais are seen as prototypical experiencers. In the latter case, the animais would still be marked as more prototypical experiencers than human beings, making the action in question particularly characteristic of the classifying animal. It should be noted, however, that there is no doubt in this reviewer's mind as to the cogency of the analysis Primarily the original formulation of the theory by Sam Glucksberg and Boaz Keysar, "Understanding Metaphorical Comparisons: Beyond Similarity", Psychological Review 97/1 (1990), pp. 3-18. Thus, as pointed out ibid., p. 9, it is no problem for an 'ad hoc category' to be deeply entrenched, even to the point of being lexicalized, which weakens part of the author's argument somewhat.</page><page sequence="4">324 Besprechungen offered by the author, if only partly due to the arguments she advances against Goldwasser's previous analysis. The author's introduction of the theory of frame semantics (pp. 67-69) enables a persuasive explanation of apparently incongruous cases such as hqr, 'hunger' classified with the man-with-hand-to-mouth classifier (A2), and makes a promising and useful innovation in the study of graphemic classification. However, given the cultural specificity of semantic frames,3 the author's reliance on modern psycho linguistic experiments with English and German speakers to explore ancient Egyptian semantic frames is questionable. In the specific case where the question concerns relations between such profoundly embodied and universal concepts as eating and hunger, the argument is convincing enough (as indeed it would have been without recourse to the modern expérimental data), but for the notion to work as a général principle, semantic frames would need to be studied on the basis of culture-specific data. Although a few particular détails of the Implementation of the framework are thus methodically debatable, the book as a whole constitutes an important addition to the literature on graphemic classification, both for its introduction of the previously unpublished theoretical framework of semantic roles which is likely to be of use in future classifier studies and for the specific analyses presented of the writing System in the Pyramid Texts, on which it offers new valuable perspectives.
