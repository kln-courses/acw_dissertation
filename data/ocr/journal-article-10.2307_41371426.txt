<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN: A STUDY OF MAHAYÃNA DEVELOPMENTS AT AJANTA • • I The Sir George Birdwood Memorial Lecture by I J! WALTER SPINK , PhD I Professor of the History of Art, the University of Michigan , delivered to the Commonwealth Section of the Society on Thursday 23rd May 1974, with John Irwin y Keeper, Oriental Department &gt; Victoria and Albert Museum &gt; in the Chair The Chairman: I have much pleasure in introducing my distinguished colleague Pro- fessor Walter Spink, who, as most of you will know, is a world authority on the subject of the cave temples of Western India. Professor Spink began his specialist career in Harvard under another Birdwood Memorial Lecturer, the late Benjamin Rowland, much lamented; in the last decade he has been at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and during this time he has made the university one of the focal centres of Indian studies in the United States. Besides his main work on cave temples he has published a number of books and articles on various subjects including Krishna Mandala and, most recently, The Axis of Eros. There are three reasons in particular why Professor Spink is a scholar rather after my own heart. First of all. he is always ready to share and discuss his knowledge and experience with anybody who comes to him, and that is one of the reasons why he is venerated among the students who have come within his ken. Secondly, he is the type of scholar for whom specialization is counter-balanced by a great breadth of knowledge and interest in the arts. He is the type of scholar whom I myself would like to hear not only on Indian subjects but on the poetry of William Blake or on the Quartets of Beethoven, or whatever you will, because on almost any aspect of art he would have some- thing interesting to say. This afternoon, however, we are going to hear him on his special field. The following lecture , which was illustrated , was then delivered. May pleasure the I Chair first and thank to-day, gratitude Mr. and Irwin at express being for taking asked my the Chair to-day, and express my pleasure and gratitude at being asked to present this Sir George Birdwood Memo- rial Lecture, an opportunity which it was an honour for me to accept. The caves at Ajantã, some 200 miles north-east of Bombay, preserve in the living rock the most splendid body of early Budd- hist art and the most telling record of Buddhist monastic activity in India. Cut along one side of a gorge of the Waghora river, there are some 30 major caves. Five of these, near the centre of the complex, belong to the early, Hínayãna, phase of Buddhism and were created some 2000 years ago. The remaining 25, with which we shall be concerned, date from the more developed Mahãyãna phase of the religion and were inaugurated in the fifth century ad by patrons who intended, according to their inscriptions, that they should last 'as long as the sun shall shine' and appear as if 'clothed in the brilliance of Indra's crown'.1 By and large, these hopes - indeed they were expectations - have been fulfilled, although the caves exist to-day as monuments to a power and a faith long since gone. Our present concern is to clarify the history of this later, Mahãyãna, phase of activity at the site, a matter of considerable scholarly dispute, but one of great impor- tance. Our understanding of the history of this climactic period of Indian art- - of 743</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER 1974 Figure i. Ajantã, Cave 21 , Interior: view from right front . (. Photograph : Asian Art Archives of the University of Michigan 1 51 33 - hereafter designated as AAA) India's so-called 'Golden Age' - depends very directly upon a correct view of Ajantâ's chronology. Most scholars assume that the Mahãyãna phase continued for 150 or 200 years, from the mid-fifth to the late sixth or seventh century ad, and date many other related monuments accordingly.2 However, we believe that Ajantâ's Mahãyãna caves were made in scarcely more than 20 years, between circa ad 462 and circa 485, mostly during the reign of a single king, the great emperor Harishena of the Vãkãtaka dynasty. Even if this is not the case, the caves of Ajantâ's Mahãyãna phase stand among the most remarkable achievements of our history; but if it is the case, the achievement is almost unparalleled. Since this 'short chronology' for Ajantã has been criticized by a number of scholars as impossibly brief, we must try to justify our point of view from the standpoint of technology as well as history, trying to determine, considering various factors, just how fast all of the work could have been done. Douglas Barrett, when a colleague wrote that the cutting of the great hall at Karla probably took fifty years, said that he himself had never dug anything larger than a foxhole but would have supposed five years a more reasonable estimate. We would agree, for we have to temper our awe with a certain objectivity. We have to think of the creation of these caves in somewhat the same way that we understand how buildings and roads are built in India to-day, with large numbers of workmen, experienced as well as unskilled, going to work every morning, getting a certain amount of work done, and keeping at it until the task is completed. Much of the work at Ajantã, of course, merely involved rough rock-removal; but a vast amount is much more than that, and practical pro- cedures were developed to accomplish it both swiftly and skilfully. When we look at a characteristically elaborate pillar from one of the later caves, we might wonder how the artist could release such a complex form from the solid rock without the design going awry. Actually the process was relatively simple 744</page><page sequence="3">OCTOBER I974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN Figure 2. Cave 17, Porch: view of main doorway and right rear wall. (. Photograph : AAA 6196) (see Figure 1; compare Figures 9 and 10). First the pillar was blocked out - probably by apprentices - in the simplest way, as a plain four-sided upright, with the capital reserved. This was then gradually cut back, first to an 8-sided form, and then, as desired, to sections of 16, 32, or even 64 sides, or finally to rounded sections. Such an approach allowed full control; and even the complex ornamental details tended to be variations of familiar themes rather than completely new 'inspirations'. In fact, many such ornate details can be seen on the pillars of the wooden palaces and temples which are depicted in murals which appear in even the earliest Mahãyãna caves. Thus such ad- vanced designs had been developed in other contexts by this time and were already avail- able for use; indeed they are clearly reflected in the complex painted decorations which often appear on the earliest pillars and which in a few special instances are actually carved on such early pillars. This being the case, it is certainly misleading to contend that a very long time-span need separate the generally severe pillars and other forms found in the earliest caves from the ornate forms found later on. The artists could have used such ornate elements from the start had they been less reticent. However, we can perhaps appreciate their problems when we realize that no caves - and few if any stone temples - had been made in this region during the preceding half-century. The local craftsmen 745</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER 1974 Figure 3. Cave 17, Porch: main doorway , upper left corner. С Photograph : courtesy Department of Archaeology , Government of India) were experienced carpenters and assured painters, but they were not experienced and assured excavators and stone-sculptors.3 It is no' wonder that they kept their first exca- vations relatively simple, often in fairly close imitation of pre-existing Hïnayâna models at the site. It was not until some five years after the site's Mahäyäna phase had begun that elaborateness became the rule. By then the carvers had obviously gained in confidence and were ready to carve out the designs which a few years earlier they would only render in paint. By way of an example, the differences between the 'early' doorway of Cave 17 and the 'late' doorway of Cave 1 is more in technique than in style. We would date them some 5 years apart - not 50 or 150, as is often suggested (compare Figures 2, 3 and 4). The impact of particular patrons - whose piety was often of a rather competitive nature, must also be considered. An important princely feudatory of King Harishena sponsored the great vihãra Cave 17, on which he proudly claims to have 'expended abundant wealth'.4 In plan it copies the vihära next door - Cave 16 - which was undertaken by Harishena's minis- ter Varãhadeva a year or so earlier.5 But Cave 17 is much more lavish in its details. The same proud prince also sponsored the nearby Cave 19, a hall for congregational worship, clearly conceived as a new focal point for the site, and consequently stun- ningly enriched with carved details.6 Sud- denly - in really no time at all - intricately worked pillars consistently varied in type, complex sculptured friezes, and fanciful brackets all appear, largely without prece- dent at the site, yet rendered with complete assurance. Obviously motifs characteristic of structural palaces and temples from the area were being transferred with one great burst of energy into stone. And Ajantä was never the same again; the stone-cutters by now had realized, or had been forced to prove, what they could do (Figure 5). Our hypothesis of a short chronology for Ajantã can be sustained by a study of the paintings in the caves. If we compare an early painted ceiling with a late one we see little definable development', even though certain changes do take place, such as the 746</page><page sequence="5">OCTOBER 1974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN Figure 4. Cave 1, Porch: main doorway , upper right corner. ( Photograph AAA 4-68 ) incorporation of anthropomorphic figures in the 'coffer-designs'. Nor need we think that painting these areas took very much time. All ceilings, early and late, are painted with an almost carefree facility, possibly freehand, or over minimal preliminary outlines. The whole expanse of the ceiling of the porch of Cave 17, with its easygoing imitation of structural beams and its exuberant flowers could hardly have taken more than a few weeks to paint (Figure 2). It was probably done by no more than two highly skilled artists, judging from a study of their style and colouring. Such evident speed is typical of work at the site. It suggests how fast all of the paintings could have been accomplished. Certainly Michelangelo, painting the 6300 sq. ft. of the Sistine ceiling, worked at a 747</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER 1974 Figure 5. Cave 79, Façade. ( Photograph : AAA 1113-66) slower pace, yet even he finished his task in four years. At that rate all of the painting at Ajantã - on ceilings, walls, pillars, and images - could have been done by a mere twenty artists in five years. Although we have no way of determining exactly how many painters did work at Ajantã, it is clear that a small number did do a great deal of the work. For instance, the famous Mahãjãnaka Jätaka, which covers almost all of one wall in Cave 1, seems to be the work of one man, and this same artist probably drew and perhaps painted a number of other major compositions in this same cave and possibly in Cave 2 as well. In other cases work was shared. The porch doorway of Cave 17, for instance, was done by two separate painters working side by side. They followed the same overall design, but retained their own particular mode of rendering and used their ojyn mixtures of pigments, which have darkened over the years at different rates. Sculptors would share such tasks as well; the doorway of Cave 14 is another joint effort, although, being one of the latest undertakings at the site, it was never finished (Figure 6). Of course we do not deny that a certain stylistic and (particularly) iconographie evolution takes place during the vigorous two decades or so of the site's patronage; but what we often find is not so much evidence of 'development' as of mere 'differences', and these differences can be explained by realizing that the dozens of skilled painters who were drawn to Ajantã came there with 748</page><page sequence="7">OCTOBER I974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN Figure 6. Cave 14, Porch: main doorway. ( Photograph : AAA 933-68) varied approaches and varied skills. Some were adept, some clumsy, some were con- servative, some very 'advanced', as we might expect. And they often appear to reflect different regional traditions. The two famous bodhisattvas which flank the entrance to Cave i's shrine are undeniably contem- porary, but are nonetheless very different. One (Figure 7) is much more 'Gupta' or 'northern'. The other (Figure 8) is more 'proto-Chãlukyan' or southern. The painters who did them may well have been drawn to Ajantã from different regions, along those same trade and pilgrimage routes used by merchants and by monks. In many instances where the edges of adjacent painted compositions meet and one slightly overlaps the other, we can tell which scene was painted first and thus come to better understand the overall sequence of work in any particular cave. Thus the bodhisattva groups in Cave 1 prove to have been done before the jãtaka scenes at either side, and these in turn were done before the compositions just below. The difference in time may not be great - we would put it in 749</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER 1974 Figure 7. Cave I, Interior: Bodhisattva on right rear wall. {Photograph: courtesy Department of Archaeology, Government of India) terms of days or weeks - but such an approach allows us to avoid the absolute inversions of truth which frequently occur in studies of the site, where scholars have depended too much on their intuitions and not enough on precise analysis. Sometimes the conclusions which emerge from such observations are surprising. For instance the very mannered Buddhas on the ceiling of Cave 10 (a repainted Hinayãna excavation), though sometimes judged extremely late in style, prove to have been painted before the figures which adorn the pillars, often con- sidered to be quite early in type. This makes sense in terms of painting procedures : ceilings were almost invariably done before walls and pillars. A telling and intriguing evidence for this is seen in Cave 17's porch, where the artist who was painting the brilliantly coloured pavilion on the wall reached up and added a few more dramatic touches to the flowers and beam-design on the already completed ceiling just above his head - perhaps telling the painter who had done the ceiling that he was improving the design.7 The challenges confronting the painters of the earliest Mahãyãna caves at Ajantã were of course very different from those confront- ing the carvers. Since they were merely transferring their skills from working on walls and ceilings of structural temples and palaces to working on the walls and ceilings of the caves, they did not have to evolve many new forms or techniques. This is why, even in the earliest caves, the paintings are generally as assured and elaborate in type as in the latest. It also helps to explain why the painters, who were already totally familiar with the technical and stylistic conventions of their craft, could work with such great speed. Let us now approach our arguments for a short chronology in another - more statisti- cal - manner, by considering how many workmen may actually have been involved in work at the site, and the approximate rate at which they worked. Great monuments, we know, can be made very quickly, when the skills, the spirit, and the funds suffice. In fact it could be argued that they cannot be made slowly, at least if they are to have the kind of consistency in style and iconography which Ajantã reveals. When the times are 750</page><page sequence="9">OCTOBER 1974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN Figure 8. Cave i, Interior: Bodhisattva on left rear wall. ( Photograph : courtesy Department of Archaeology , Government of India) ripe, they are usually not ripe for long. Akbar, in the midst of his many other involvements, was able to build Fatehpur Sikri - a roughly equivalent undertaking - in much less time than we allow for Ajantã. And it took Louis XIV only slightly longer to create Ver- sailles, where the roofed area of the palace alone covers 17 acres and houses about 10,000 people. In each of these latter pro- jects we know that thousands of workers were simultaneously employed. We have no way of knowing the number hired at Ajantã, but it must have been considerable. One proof of this is that, at the time of the site's collapse, no less than 21 of the 25 major Mahãyãna excavations were still incomplete ; and by noting the clear relation- ships in their style and iconography we can tell that they were all being actively worked on simultaneously, influencing each other as their excavation and decoration proceeded. Thus the site's Mahãyãna phase could develop very quickly, for from its inception it appears to have developed in this way, and certainly not cave by cave. (See Time Chart, Figure 19.) Of course, this is just as we would expect at a site where interest sud- denly accumulated, and where many dif- ferent patrons were involved in seeing to the execution of their own separate under- takings. Thus Ajantã must always have been a busy place, resounding, however, much more with the shouts of workmen than with the chanting of monks. As we might expect, only when caves were quite near completion would they be turned over for residence purposes; in such caves, but not in the less finished ones, we can see signs of wear in the chiselled-out pivot holes which once held the swinging cell doors. As we might expect, no monks ever lived in Cave 24, a large cave located at the west end of the site, an area where work was being vigorously extended, with a whole series of late caves, during the site's final years. It is only half-excavated, and for this reason provides an ideal record of work in progress, giving us some clue as to the number of men who were probably employed on this one of many contemporaneous undertakings (Fig- ures 9, 10, 11). Work was proceeding, as we might expect, from front to back, and from the ceiling downward - the latter procedure taking 751</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER I974 Figure 9. Cave 24 , Interior : pillars (unfinished) of front aisle . (Photograph: AAA 6160 ) advantage of the uncut rock for usejas a natural scaffolding. The porch and front aisle were nearing completion, but the larger part of the interior is Very incomplete indeed. It seems reasonable to suppose that at least one man was at work on each of the twenty pillars, which are in various stages of definition, and were eventually to be of the elaborate late type. Other men were working on the aisle cells, while two men were just starting on the shrine, leaving some rock between their sections, presumably so that their work could be accurately measured and they could be paid accordingly. Elsewhere, the rock is also being cut away in sections - the same system is used when men in India dig dirt to-day - again, in order to facilitate fair payment. Later on, the 'dividers' could be removed at a cheaper rate, being quickly chiselled away from below. Together with other workers who were smoothing the walls, it appears that at least fifty or sixty excava- tors, supported by attendants, must have 752 been at work in this one excavation. Using this cave as a guide, it seems probable that a few hundred excavators, plasterers, and painters were employed throughout the site in this very active period, when twenty other caves were also under way. It seems safe to assume that at least 100 such craftsmen, on the average, were at work during the course of the site's Mahãyãna phase. One can get a fair impression of the amount of rock such a worker could remove in a single day by noting the manner of chiselling - often in long vertical arcs, as the chisel was guided downward by repeated hammer blows. The stone thus stripped away, as well as large chunks of the removed rock, would finally be thrown down into the gorge by the supporting work crews. Block- ing out the doors and windows, and smooth- ing walls and ceilings, would be more time- consuming, but allin all a total of 4 cubic feet (equivalent to a block slightly more than 1 J feet on a side) seems conservative as the</page><page sequence="11">OCTOBER 1974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN Figure 10. Cave 24 , Interior (1 unfinished ): view toward the rear estimated volume of rock which one man - on the average - could remove in a single day. Then roughly estimating the total volume of rock removed from the interiors and exteriors of the caves - 1,400,000 cubic feet - we can calculate that an average force of 100 workmen could have done all this in about il years 8 months, working 8 hours a day, 300 days a year. Detailed carving would of course be more time-consuming. We figure that a typical elaborate doorway could be decorated by one man in 18 months. Thus 100 men could do all the major doorways in six months. The detailing of the large pillars - there are some 400 at the site - would take 100 men about one year, as would the carving of the major image groups. Figuring in the win- dows, aisle doorways, pilasters, lesser image groups, and allowing one month as the time it would take 100 men to do all of the plastering (150,000 sq. ft. at the rate of 60 sq. ft. per day) and two years for all of the painting (115,000 sq. ft. at the average rate of 2 sq. ft. per day), we calculate that 100 men (supported by attendants) could have accomplished all of the work done at the site in 18 years and 6 months. Admittedly these are rough estimates, but since they are cautious ones, it seems hard to believe that the total work could have taken much longer than the two decades or so which our calculations allow.8 The final key to Ajantä's chronology lies in epigraphic and historical evidence. If we have interpreted this correctly, the site's Mahãyãna phase falls between the outer limits of circa ad 462 and circa 485. How- ever, our conclusions depend upon assump- tions regarding the general development of forms at the site. The earliest caves undertaken during the Mahãyãna phase are mostly located near the site's centre and are relatively simple in style. They are generally either finished or nearly so. A number of donative records prove that none of them were excavated after the reign of the Vãkãtaka king Harishena, in 753</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER 1974 Figure i i . Cave 24 , Plan . Reproduced from J. Burgess , Report on the Buddhist Cave Temples and Their Inscriptions, London, 1883 , Plate XXXIV ( 3 ) the last half of the fifth century.9 The later caves, generally located at the site's extremi- ties, are often very incomplete, but much more elaborate in every way. Unfortunately none of these later caves contain donative records which locate them precisely in time.10 But the late motifs which they incorporate bear direct connections with motifs in certain other caves - at Bãgh, at Ghatotkacha, and at Ajantã itself - which can be dated to about ad 480 or very shortly thereafter, as we shall see. Consequently, Ajantä's latest excavations must have been completed at about this time. We must of course be sure that the motifs which we are comparing do indeed belong to the late stages of Ajantä's developmental 754 continuum. For the present, we shall refer to pillars alone, as an important example, and one regarding whose development most scholars agree. The pillars in the earliest Mahãyãna caves at Ajantã usually have plain octagonal shafts, without differentiated bases, and often with- out clearly defined capitals. They tend to be unvaried in type (Figure 12). In contrast, pillars in relatively late caves are quite complex, with shafts which have varied polygonal or circular sections, rising from high square bases and crowned by elabor- ately carved capitals. These late pillars are consistently varied in type, depending on their placement, creating in effect a hierarchy of pillar forms (see Figures 1 and 9).</page><page sequence="13">OCTOBER I974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN Figure 12. Cave i6, Interior: view from left front . ( Photograph : AAA 11247) At Bãgh, some 125 miles away, we find pillars with these late features (Figure 17) in caves which must be dated well before circa ad 486, at which time Mahãrãja Subandhu of Mãhishmati made repairs at that already flourishing site, as we know from a copper plate unearthed in Bãgh Cave 2. 11 Further- more, many other stylistic motifs at Bãgh, and numerous iconographie forms, have equally close connections with forms found only in the very late Ajantã caves. In the latter regard we can mention Buddhas seated in the pralambapãdãsana pose, Buddhas with thrones backed by birds' heads rather than lotuses, and image groups where attendant bodhisattvas have been replaced by standing Buddhas. Thus, if such an extensive body of motifs, typical of the late Ajantã style, is to be found throughout the Bãgh caves, all of which appear to have been excavated between circa ad 470 and circa 480, it seems most likely that the caves at Ajantã could date from later in this same general period.12 This conclusion is supported by an analysis of the even less well-known vihãra at Ghatotkacha, some 1 1 miles from Ajantã.13 It was probably made by craftsmen from that greater site and almost certainly by the same donor, Harishena's minister Varãhadeva, who sponsored Ajantã Cave 16. Its badly mutilated inscription, which refers to Harishena and (according to most epigraphists) to Varãhadeva as well, is carved on the back wall of the porch, in the midst of architectural features found only 755</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER 1974 Figure 13a.

Cave 16, Interior: view into the shrine. {Photograph: AAA 1100-66) in the latest Ajantã caves.14 Inside, we find many other late features, of which we will mention only the hierarchically arranged and elaborate pillars (Figure 18). Yet none of these developed motifs, many of which are comparable only to very late forms at Ajantã, can postdate circa ad 480, since the cave was inscribed during the period of Vãkãtaka patronage.15 The third piece of inscriptional evidence which confirms a dating of between circa 462 and 485 for Ajantã is to be found at Ajantã itself. This involves an analysis of Cave 16, a benefaction of this same Varãhadeva, whose donative record describes the cave as '[resembling] the palaces of the lord of gods' and being 'adorned with. . . beautiful picture galleries. . . and [having] a temple of the Buddha [chaitya mandiram ] inside.'16 Nearly all scholars agree that Cave 16 was one of the very first undertakings of Ajantâ's Mahãyãna phase. But a crucial point has not been noted : it is one of the latest too. Its excavation and decoration were interrupted in mid-course, 757</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER 1974 Figure 15. Cave 16, Interior: view in the shrine&gt; looking to the left. (. Photograph : AAA 11250) apparently due to some political or economic setback which affected Vãkãtaka patronage in general, since many early caves were similarly affected (see Time Chart, Figure 19)- Like the adjacent Cave 17, Cave 16 was to have had a conventional early-type shrine, with a Buddha seated in the padmãsana pose and a circumambulatory passage.14 (Figure 13a). But work broke off when the rear aisle, with its central shrine and adjacent cells, was barely begun (Figure 13c), even though most of the ceilings and walls toward the front of the cave had already been plastered and painted. Such a procedure was characteristic at the site ; the plasterers and painters always followed close upon the heels of the excavators. 758 Later on, Varähadeva's patronage was renewed. But ideas had changed. A new type of shrine was planned - an impressive and unique pillared pavilion - in which a gigantic pralambapãdãsana image - a type never carved before at the site - directly confronts the devotee with no intervening shrine antechamber (Figure 14). This new shrine was built by 're-drawing' the old plan which had never been completely realized (Figure 13d). The unfinished cells nearby were in- corporated into it: the new shrine's lateral walls, the more forward sections of which are not quite vertical, reflect the course of the earlier cutting. The later planners also had to improvise a doorway to close off the image when they redesigned this area, since it no longer (like Cave 17) has a conventional</page><page sequence="17">OCTOBER I974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN Figure 16. Cave 16, Interior: enthroned Buddha painted on the right rear wall {detail). С Photograph : AAA 40-72 detail) entrance. Therefore they affixed the wooden doorposts to the shrine's front pillars, drastically cutting them away for this pur- pose. One can still see marks on the floor where the wooden doors were opened and closed. The impact of this new shrine is enormous - it is hardly surprising that Varähadeva makes particular mention of it in his dedi- catory inscription; and the influence of the new and authoritative image was immediate. Nearly all of the important images started at the site during the remaining years of the site's patronage are of this pralambapãdãsana type, as are images of the sixth century at Nãsik, Kanheri, Aurangabad and Ellora.19 The conclusion that the Cave 16 shrine is significantly later than elements in the more forward parts of the cave is supported by the late character of its inner pillars, which are of a distinctly late type (Figure 15). Two of them have diagonal flutings, a feature which never appears during the first decade of activity at the site but is common in the later caves.20 Various features of the image's throne-back also confirm a late dating. Only on very late thrones at the site do gem- strands depend from the paws of the vyälas and do dwarfs gambol around them. The fact that the rear portions of this cave were not fully cut out until a late date also explains why the paintings on the rear wall (Figure 16) are so much later in character than those in the porch and in the more forward parts of the interior. Their nervous outlines, exaggerated high- lights, and even the blue shadowing some- times used on the upper eyelids, all relate them to other late paintings at the site (for instance in Cave 2) as do their various iconographie features, such as the pralamba- pãdãsana pose, the presence of birds' heads at the throne backs and the inclusion of attendant Buddhas (probably reflecting a significant theological development) in the compositions.21 Other scholars have also recognized that these rear wall paintings are late in type, but following more conventional theories of chronology they ascribed them to the sixth or 759</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER 1974 Figure 17. Bãgh3 Cave 2 , Interior: view across the cave, from the left aisle. ( Photograph : AAA 944-73) seventh century., long after Varähadeva had dedicated the cave. Yet how could such crucial walls, flanking the shrine, have been left undecorated at this time?22 For this and the other reasons we have cited it is evident that the very late motifs in and around the shrine of Cave 16 all belong to a period when Harishena and Varähadeva, the cave's donor, were still in power, close to ad 480, at a moment when Ajantä's development, al- though still vigorous, was very near its end. According to the evidence of the Daáakumãracharita, which describes (albeit in the guise of a story) the political situation at the time of the Vãkãtakas' downfall, the great Harishena was succeeded by an inept son.23 During this son's brief reign, the feudatory house of the Ašmakas gained a pernicious influence at the court and ultimately instigated a revolt of the once- loyal Vãkãtaka feudatories. The weak king was killed, and the dynasty collapsed. When this happened, Harishena's grandson fled for safety to Mähishmati on the Narmadã, where his paternal uncle was ruling. This event must have taken place in the 480s, when we know that Mahäräja Subandhu, who undertook repairs at Bägh, was ruling 760 in that very city, according to an inscription of ad 486.24 Two points emerge. First, it would appear that this Subandhu, the benefactor of Bägh, was actually another one of Hari- shena's sons, a relationship which helps to explain the striking connections between Bägh and Ajantã.25 Second, since in ad 486 Subandhu - who styles himself a Mahäräja - was apparently an independent ruler, the unified empire which Harishena's successor had inherited and which had included Mähishmati, must have collapsed prior to this time.26 This assumption is further supported by inscriptions of the Traiku- takas, dated in ad 490 and 494, which show that they too - although previously counted among the Vãkãtaka feudatories - had also become independent now.27 Just how long before ad 486 the Vãkãtaka dynasty collapsed we cannot absolutely determine, but since Harishena could not have come to power until after 458 (when his father was ruling) and since his reign was very eventful and therefore probably lengthy, it seems unlikely that it ended earlier than circa 48o.28 We must also allow a few years - again, prior to 486 - for the troubled reign</page><page sequence="19">OCTOBER I974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN Figure 18.

Therefore circa 485 would seem a reasonable hypothetical date for the dynasty's final collapse. Work at Ajantã probably continued right up to this point,, although its very latest stages seem to reflect the increasing political and cultural turmoil, with many of the consis- tent programmes of excavation and decor- ation breaking down in these final years, intrusive images being placed in locations where one would expect to find major mural compositions.29 As for the start of Ajantâ's patronage, it probably did not begin until shortly after Harishena had come to power. We can suppose this for various reasons. First of all, none of the other major Vãkãtaka cave sites - Aurangabad, Ghatotkacha, or Bãgh - ante- date his reign, as their relatively advanced stylistic features prove. This would suggest that Harishena, although a Hindu, actively supported or allowed his courtiers and feudatories to support the Buddhists. We know that this explains Ajantâ's startling growth, during this Mahãyãna phase, and it quite possibly explains its very inception. Furthermore, Cave 16, undertaken by Harishena's minister, although not the very first cave started at the site, is so intimately related to slightly earlier undertakings at the site, that it must have been begun almost as soon as they were under way. Indeed, some of the first elements executed in the very earliest caves of Ajantâ's Mahãyãna phase are stylistically parallel or even posterior to elements in the early portions of Cave 16. Thus we would propose that activity at Ajantã, which ended circa ad 485, did not begin until after Harishena's accession, perhaps a year or two after he had settled into power, let us say in approximately 462. Cave 16 may have been started in circa 464 with Varähadeva's active patronage ending in circa 479, after which time 'having presented [it] to the Community of Monks. . . [he] ruled righteously', according to his dedicatory inscription, which appar- ently was written a few years later.30 Of course we do not mean to suggest that it took a full 15 years - from circa 464 to circa 479 - for Varãhadeva to see to the excavation and decoration of Cave 16; it divides into two distinct phases with a long hiatus - from circa 470 to circa 477 - in between, as we have suggested above. 762 October 1974 If the caves at Ajantã and the other Vãkãtaka sites reveal the remarkable benefits which art and religion can receive from a strong patronage, they equally stand as stark witness to the traumatic impact which political events can have upon such cultural developments. As we have mentioned, of the 25 major Mahãyãna caves at Ajantã which were undertaken so enthusiastically during the slightly more than two decades of the site's development, only four had been finished when both the dynasty and the site collapsed in about 48 5. 31 The others, in various stages of completion, some fully cut but not completely painted, others far from fully excavated, were abandoned.32 Indeed it is only because of this fact that the paintings in most of them, after fifteen centuries, remain so free of obscuring grime.33 The artists, many of whom had been attracted to Ajantã from distant regions, now had to seek work elsewhere. Some may have migrated toward the north-east, where a decade or so later we find a number of temples such as that at Deogarh, which incorporate motifs remarkably reminiscent of late forms at Ajantã.34 Others certainly went west, where work was available at sites such as Kanheri, now being sponsóred by ťthe augmenting kingdom of the Traikutakas' - Harishena's former feudatories; according to the Surat plates of Vyãghrasena the Traikutakas were ruling over this region (ancient Aparantã) in ad 490. 35 Thus ad 490 (and perhaps even ad 486, when the king of Mãhishmati was also ruling independently) would appear to provide a terminus ante quern for the end of the Vãkãtaka rule, and of the development of Ajantã and the other sites which they had patronized. By the second quarter of the sixth century, a new dynasty, that of the Early Kalachuris, had become supreme in this same western region. It was they who sponsored the first great Hindu cave temples - the Shivaite monuments at Jogeshvari, Mandapeshwar, and Elephanta.36 By then many of the artists who had worked at Ajantã during the climactic but final years of the Vãkãtaka dynasty were dead. However, their aesthetic ideals and their standards of craftsmanship still inform these great Hindu monuments, Ajantâ's most immediate heirs.</page><page sequence="21">OCTOBER 1974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN FIGURE 19. TIME CHART This chart shows the approximate dates of the Mahãyãna Buddhist caves of the Vãkãtaka period at Ajantã (Caves 1-1 1 ; 14-29), the vihãra at Ghatotkacha, and Caves 1 and 3 at Auranga- bad. The approximate date of the main image in each cave is denoted by an asterisk. In the case of Cave 7 the asterisk refers only to the image proper and to the throne base; the throne sides and surrounding figures were carved more than a decade later. Harishena was already in power in circa ad 462, when the Mahãyãna phase at Ajantã began. A widespread temporary decline in patronage occurred circa ad 470, although work on Caves 17, 19, and 20 continued. With the death of Harishena in circa ad 482 the con- sistent programmes of excavation and decoration are gradually abandoned, and various intrusive painted and sculptured images appear in their stead. By circa ad 485 the Ašmakas had gained control of the region, the Vãkãtaka dynasty had collapsed, and activity at the Vãkãtaka cave sites virtually ended. REFERENCES I. Quoted from the inscription of Ajantã Cave 16, a donation of Varãhadeva, minister of the Vãkãtaka king Harishena. See V. V. Mirashi, Inscriptions of the Vãkãtakas, Corpus Inscrip- tionem Indicarum, Vol. 5 (Ootacamund, 1963), pp. 103-11. 2. It was once thought that a mural in Cave 1 (front wall) depicted the visit of a Persian embassy to the court of the Chãlukyas in ad 625. This identification has long since been discredited, but was probably the origin of the theory that Ajantã was flourishing in the seventh century and that monuments such as Elephanta, being later, should be dated to the eighth century, some two centuries too late. I 3. The apparent absence of a local tradition of 763</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER 1974 stone sculpture is equally noteworthy. It may be that before such elaborately sculptured monu- ments as Cave 19 were inaugurateci skilled sculptors from Sarnãth and Mathurã had been attracted to the site. 4. V. V. Mirashi, Inscriptions of the Vãkãtakas, pp. 120-29. 5. See note 1. 6. Cave 19 is almost certainly the ťgrand gandhakuti' (perfumed hall) 'lying to the west' which Cave 17's donor 'also made', according to his inscription. Cave 20 - often considered a relatively late cave - is actually closely connec- ted with both Cave 17 and 19 in style, icono- graphy, and location. It may have been given by this same donor, whose name is missing but whose father was Krishnadãsa and who had an ancestor named Upëndragupta. The donor of Cave 20 was Upëndra . . . , and his father's name, according to Burgess, may have been Kri (shnadãsa). See J. Burgess, Report on the Buddhist Cave Temples and Their Inscriptions , ASWI, Vol. 4, London 1883, p. 132. 7. Such details, and other evidences of over- lappings, do not reproduce sufficiently well in monochrome for inclusion here. 8. Palaeographic considerations suggest this too, since some of the latest donative records at the site show no discernible development in their letter-forms over donative records associated with the earliest caves. See W. Spink, 'Ajantâ's Chronology: The Problem of Cave Eleven', Ars Orientalis, VII, 1968, pp. 155-68. 9. The earliest Mahãyãna caves (Caves 8, 7, Lower 6, 11) must all have been begun earlier than Caves 17, 19, and 20, and probably before Cave 16 as well; thus they could not have been undertaken after Harishena's reign. Caves 8 and Lower 6 were finished, but the excavation and decoration of Caves 7 and 11, as well as of Caves 4, 15, 16, 2, and Upper 6, was interrup- ted by a short hiatus in patronage ; they all show two distinct phases in their excavation. 10. Cave 26's donative inscription refers to the Ašmakas, probably because they were a major influence at the Vãkãtaka court at the time; they are not mentioned as ruling. For this reason and because of the many connections between Cave 26 and caves which can be dated to the period of Varâhadeva's patronage it seems unlikely that Cave 26 was a donation of the period of Ašmaka rule, which immediately followed the Vãkãtaka fall. For the Cave 26 inscription see G. Yazdani, Ajantã , text Vol. 4, (Oxford, 1955) pp. 1 16-18. il. See V. V. Mirashi, Inscriptions of the Kalachuri-Chedi Era , . Corpus Inscriptionem Indicarum, Vol. 4 (Ootacamund, 1955), Part 1, pp. 19-21. The date has been lost, but the related Barwãni plate is dated in the year 167= ad 486, if the reckoning is from the Gupta era, as we believe. Mirashi and others date this record to ad 417, however, using the Kalachuri era reck- oning. This is impossible, judging from the style of the Bãgh caves. 764 12. Bägh will be discussed in detail in a book now being prepared for publication. 13. See W. Spink, 'Ajantã and Ghatotkacha : A Preliminary Analysis', Ars Orientalis, VI, 1966, PP- 135-55- Our datings have been slightly revised since that article was written. 14. For the inscription, see V.

Begley, Chronology of Mahãyãna Buddhist Architecture and Painting at Ajantã , unpubl. doct. diss., U. of Pennsylvania, 1966, pp. 35 ff., believes that the Ghatotkacha inscrip- tion, although a Vãkãtaka record, may postdate Harishena's reign, a conclusion with which we do not agree. 16. See note 1. For a lengthy analysis of Cave 16, see W. Spink, 'Ajantâ's Chronology : The Crucial Cave', Ars Orientalis , IX, 1974 (forthcoming). 17. Of caves started prior to circa ad 470 and still unfinished at that date, only Caves 17, 19, and 20 were not affected by this hiatus, possibly because their donor was a semi-independent prince. See notes 6 and 9. 18. All shrine images carved prior to Cave 16's are in the padmãsana pose; for dating of these images see Time Chart. Of the first four images, those of Lower 6, 1 1, and 17 could be circumam- bulated, and that of Cave 7 was planned with this in mind, but was not completed in the early phase, being revised later. Cave 16's shrine does allow circumambulation, and partly for this reason the image has been generally dated very early. However, the shrine was not conceived with this purpose in mind and was certainly never so used, as I explain in an article on Cave 16 (ref. note 16). 19. Many such images are found in late shrine- lets and panels at the site, while the main images of Caves 22 and 26, and of the related Aurangabad Cave 3, are of this type. 20. The first pillars with diagonal flutings appear shortly before circa ad 475 in Cave 19 and Cave i, well after Cave 16's initial phase of patronage had been interrupted. 21. Such attendant Buddhas are common in both carved and painted groups in the late period, the first examples probably being in the lower row of paintings on the right wall in Cave 19, dating to approximately ad 475. Their identification has not been determined, but they are probably not 'historical' Buddhas. 22. The rear wall of the interior was normally given special attention. In Cave 16, not only are the enthroned Buddhas painted in this area but two other late and elaborate paintings show dramatic processions converging upon the image in the shrine; they complement the image and were probably planned in conjunction with it. 23. See V. V. Mirashi, 'Historical Data in Dandin's Dasakumãracharita', Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute , Vol. 26, 19453 PP- 20-31. Except for this (presumably reliable) reference to Harishena's successor in</page><page sequence="23">OCTOBER I974 THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN the Dasakumãracharita, no other later Vãkãtaka rulers are known from documentary sources. Recent studies suggest that the marriage of the Vishnukunçlin Mãdhavavarman to a Vãkãtaka princess took place in the last half of the fifth century and not in the sixth century as was previously supposed. See Rama Rao, 'New Light on the Vishnukundins', Proceedings of the 27th Indian History Congress, Allahabad, 1965. 24. See note il. 25. The ruler of Mähishmati to whom Hari- shena's grandson fled could have been Subandhu's predecessor (and father?) if the Vãkãtaka fall took place much before ad 486, but this seems unlikely. 26. Anüpa, the region which includes Mähish- mati, appears to have already been under Vãkãtaka control in the mid-fifth century, eventually being incorporated into Harishena's familial domains. It is not mentioned as a territory which Harishena conquered, in the Cave 16 inscription, yet regions beyond it are so mentioned; presumably Anüpa was already part of the kingdom.

Mirashi, Inscriptions of the Kalachuri-Chedi Era, pp. 25-32. Another inscription dated to ad 457 (ibid., pp. 22-5) antedates Harishena's mnniipst 28.

This process of disruption is discussed in previous articles; see notes 13 and 16. 30. For arguments suggesting that portions of Cave 16, for instance the plastering of the monks' cells and certain intrusive paintings, were done after Varãhadeva had turned his cave over to the monks, see the article referred to in note 16. 31. The four are Caves 8, Lower 6, 17, and 19. (The shrine walls and ceiling of Cave 17 were never painted, but this may have been inten- tional.) 32. The consistent programmes of excavation and decoration in many of the caves may have ended slightly before the site's final collapse, due to the increasingly troubled times. (See Time Chart.) 33. The painting in Cave Lower 6, completed early, are covered with a thick layer of soot, probably from oil lamps, for the hanging of which some of the iron hooks still fixed in the ceilings and pillars may have been used. A few of the caves, used in more recent times by sãdhus, etc., reveal more recent damage. 34. See W. Spink, 'A Temple with Four Uchchakalpa (?) Doorways at Nãchnã Kutharã', Chhavi: Golden Jubilee Volume, Bhãrat Kalã Bhavan, Benares, IQ72, od. 161-72. 35. The quotation is from the Kanheri inscrip- tion of ad 494, ref. note 27. 36.

However, the dates given therein vary slightly from the dates in this present article, the latter being more precise. DISCUSSION Mr. A. H. Christie (School of Oriental and African Studies* University of London): I am quite prepared to believe that one can cut caves very much quicker than has sometimes been suggested, but I am worried by the suggestion that you can seriously start plastering and paint- ing while you are still cutting. Plastering and painting require a relative quiescent atmosphere. If you have got to shift the spoil from the back of the cave through the area which you are plastering and painting there would surely be immense difficulties with dust and dirt ? The Lecturer: I am sure that they did it this way. I think this was partly owing to the pressure put on the craftsmen by the patrons, who were pious but also enviously watching other patrons and wanting to get their own work done quickly. There are many examples where very incomplete caves are full of plastered areas, sometimes not yet painted. In some startling examples it is clear that plastering and painting was going on two feet away from areas where the craftsmen were ripping great chunks of rock out. It did not have to be done this way and it is not a 'sensible' procedure, but in terms of excavating logic, it is consistent. The very unfinished caves which lie towards the western extremity of the site are the ones which have relatively little painting, as we might expect. It isn't a case where you can say that people came in two centuries later and plastered and painted some previously unfinished caves. They always plastered and painted the porches first, and the more important parts of the cave interiors. Of course, they normally didn't start this latter painting until the cave was under way; but I would say they invariably started it before the cave was completely excavated. I don't think there is one case where I could say that these processes didn't go on simultaneously. Mr.Josef:I come from Bombay, India, and Elephanta and Ajantã caves temples are not far from Bombay. Are there any comparable cave temples in other countries which came under Buddhist influence, such as Burma, Ceylon, Japan or even Afghanistan? 765</page><page sequence="24">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS OCTOBER I974 The Lecturer: In Afghanistan and in China you have many Buddhist caves of approxi- mately the same period. It is interesting to know that in certain large groups of caves at Yun Kang and Lung Men no one questions what one might call a short chronology. In one major group at Yun Kang the same amount of rock has been taken out perhaps as at the whole of Ajantã, and it was certainly done in less than one generation in the late fifth century. I don't think people would have questioned the rapid chronology for Ajantã if things had not got off to a wrong start in the nineteenth century, when Burgess looked at one of the paintings in Cave 1, which seems to be an embassy scene. He suggested that it might be the visit of a Persian ambassador to the Hindu King Pulakesin II, which took place in ad 625. He suggested that if this were the case that painting had to date from ad 625 or later, and so other paintings in Cave 1 were also dated to the seventh century. Other people took this up and fixed it as an idea. Then, because A janta is clearly somewhat earlier than Elephanta they said Elephanta should be eighth century, which doesn't make any sense because it puts it in stylistic and inconographic conflict with the great Kailisa temple of Ellora which we know is eighth century, but which is very different. But having dated Elephanta to the eighth century and various articles and books having been written on this, it became increasingly clear that Ajantã was seventh century. So a whole frame- work was built up according to which Ajantã was dated from the fifth into the seventh, and sometimes into the eighth century. It goes back to that original humble suggestion by Burgess. That, I think, is the origin of the long chronology for Ajantã. Professor William Watson (Percival David Foundation) : Accepting Professor Spink's short chronology, may I comment on the comparison with chronologies in the Far East ? It is interesting that the execution of the cave temples at Tun Huang in Kansu, and the execution of their first murals, began at about the same time as the beginning of the late phase at Ajantã. But in China a direct influence from Ajantã is hardly made more probable by this coincidence, given the background of the Chinese Buddhism of the period. One should perhaps treat with greater caution the rather facile comparison of style that has been made between painting at Ajantã and that at Tun Huang, for example in the Deer Jataka series - a comparison made, I believe, on the grounds of a general resemblance of colours and some features of composition. It is generally agreed that the early painting at Tun Huang belongs to the pre-Yun Kang period and was therefore executed before the middle of the fifth century. At the other end of the possible date range of Ajantã influence in the Far East - the murals of 7 66 the Höryüji Kondõ in Nara, Japan -the Ajantã connexion is claimed more plausibly. But since the Höryüji paintings belong to the last quarter of the seventh century, the comparison is with Ajantã work executed at least two centuries earlier, according to our lecturer. Is it possible that even after the cessation of work at Ajantã it was still a place of pilgrimage which attracted men likely to copy paintings and to convey them to the Far East ? The Lecturer: That is an interesting suggestion. I think that caves were abandoned after about ad 485. Even in the last century, however, we know the villagers would come there for festivals and so forth, and we know that certain recent sadhus took up residence and smoked up certain of the caves which otherwise would have been quite fresh and clean. There is one apparently late inscription on Cave 26 that hasn't really been worked out very convincingly ; but it may be proof of a certain degree of con- tinuing interest in the site in the eighth century. The site must have been a hallowed spot to go to ; but certainly there were no monks there, in my opinion. Hsuan Ts'ang, the Chinese traveller in the seventh century, mentions this site but he mentions it in a way which suggests that he did not actually go to it. It wasn't a flourishing site any more, which is rather remarkable because it was still renowned. Mr. Reginald Massey: I refer particu- larly to a slide you showed us of three pillars with two monkey tails. This brought home to me that in the fifth century ad Indian painters certainly had a sense of the techniques of perspective. What I can't understand is why, much later in the history of Indian painting, one sees strange lapses in this sense of perspective. Is there perhaps some substance in the view of Western art historians that Indian art is basically 'non- traditional' ? The Lecturer: They did have an under- standing of perspective; not perhaps in Western Renaissance terms, but very much better than fifth century Western perspective. These were highly sophisticated, skilled painters. Indian art doesn't show that kind of almost cathartic renewal that is seen in the Western tradition, where you move from the Hellenic to the Hellenistic and from Hellenistic to Roman, and then that is reversed as you get into early Christian and Romanesque, and then the pen- dulum swings back to the Renaissance and swings again to the Baroque. You have constant change. In India there is much more of a tendency to retain the forms finally found, and I would say its golden age occurred when technical and conceptual developments allowed the ideal form to be realized. There is a great conservatism in the Indian artistic tradition, a traditionalism which makes them reflect the past. There is a kind of fixation that comes in and a fluidity that</page><page sequence="25">OCTOBER I974 goes out, very often. Artists more and more tended to copy what they loosely called the Gupta style ; but of course as they copied it (you can see this happening in folk art too) they forgot just why, or what they were doing, and a new design interest entered. The Chairman: I think it is no. v the moment to oiïer a vote of thanks to Professor Spink for putting his case so lucidly and with such an interesting collection of slides. It is the best illustrated lecture on Ajantã I have ever heard, and I found it very stimulating. It has THE SPLENDOURS OF INDRA'S CROWN given us a lot to think about. As a Curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum I am astonished to think that Ajantã could have been created in twenty years, when it has taken us twenty years to select a new building for our Indian Collec- tions before even a hammer and chisel have touched it! Professor Spink, thank you very much for this most interesting lecture, and for the wonder- ful slides you have shown with it. The meeting concluded amidst the usual accla- mation of the Lecturer and Chairman. 767</page></plain_text>
