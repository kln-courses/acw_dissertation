<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Primacy of Faith. By RICHARD KRO- NER. New York: The Macmillan Com- pany, 1943. ix+-226 pages. $2.50. This book contains the Gifford Lectures for 1939-1940. Its author "was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Kiel for five years. In 1934 his class at that univer- sity was violently broken up by Nazi storm troopers and he resigned his professorship. He left Germany in 1938, and after giving courses at Oxford University and St. An- drews in Scotland, he came to the United States. He spent the year 1940-1941 at Yale, and he is at present Lecturer in the Philosophy of Religion at Union Theologi- cal Seminary, New York." Dr. Kroner has already published two books in English: The Religious Function of Imagination (Yale, i94i) and How Do We Know God? (Harpers, 1923). These two volumes as well as The Primacy of Faith reveal Dr. Kroner as a penetrating, audacious, and extremely suggestive thinker. Together they constitute prolegomena to a philosophy of religion which should be es- pecially welcome to Bible teachers. In the first place, Dr. Kroner leaves little, occasion for the intellectual embarrassment which every believer has felt in this age of science. Who has not, sometime or other, apologized for the "anthropomorphism" of the Bible, and tried to argue that in their own primitive way the ancient Hebrews have something, of importance to say to this enlightened age? Confronted with the scientist and the formidable philosopher, the Bible teacher has often been tempted to ad- mit that his subject is primarily of histori- cal and moral interest, with little claim to the attention of one in search of truth. Thus, Biblical teaching has often degenerated into story-telling and vapid moralism. For a proper understanding of man and his world, we turn to some contemporary thinker who seems to have achieved the best synthesis of science, philosophy, and religion. Now, of course, if the proper symbols of truth are abstractions like "reality," "value,"' "process," "personality," "science," "re- ligion," and a host of others which clutter up the books on the philosophy of religion in our day, then the concrete and pictorial language of the Bible must be of doubtful</page><page sequence="2">234 BOOK REVIEWS [November epistemological significance. If "pure thought" is the proper representation of truth, then the constant dependence of the Biblical writers upon perception and imagi- nation must disqualify them as dependable sources of knowledge. However, any one who is not perpetually hypnotized by words, must at least suspect that adjectives turned into substantives, which are the main para- phernalia of "pure thought," signify nothing at all. The imagination which, as Dr. Kroner rightly insists, is the link between percep- tion and "the notions of our understand- ing," is indispensable for a genuine knowl- edge of our world. It is abstractions which need to justify themselves before the imagi- nation, rather than the other way around. If our systematizing thinkers would pay more attention to the observations of the Biblical writers, they would be more truth- ful about man and his world. Hence, Dr. Kroner's studies of the imagination should have a salutary effect upon both Biblical teaching and the philosophy of religion. Dr. Kroner's partiality towards image and imagination is not merely common sense reasserting itself. It is the fruit of life-long devotion to philosophy and speculation. Dr. Kroner is an acute and profound student of the history of philosophy, especially of Kant and Hegel. He is one of the few phi- losophers in America, so far as I know, who take Kant's "critique of pure reason" seri- ously and do justice to its metaphysical im- plications. He accepts Kant's judgment that "unavoidable antinomies, natural para- logisms, fatal illusions bar the way to the throne of the Highest for human under- standing" (p. 32). Speculation of the most rigorous kind, on the basis of our experi- ence, on time, space, causality, ends in a set of paradoxes which define the limits of rea- son. "This intrinsic tragedy of all meta- physics was discovered and disclosed for all time by Kant" (p. I6I). Hegel's mighty effort to include Being and existence in a system, and his failure, are ample justifi- cation of Kant's conviction that the Creator cannot be transformed into a philosophic concept (p. 162). "Pure thought" cannot grasp the Creator. All "natural theology" ends in paradox, and our ideas of God are either idolatrous or contradictory. God as value producing interaction in the world is an idol, and "Supreme Being" conceals a paradox. The fact that many of us do not have the wit to see this, is beside the point. In denying that reason alone can compre- hend God, Dr. Kroner takes a position in harmony with the mind of the Bible. Bibli- cal thought on God is never "pure." The problem of the knowledge of God in the Bi- ble is one piece with the problem of the knowledge of His will, and the latter is in- separable from the fact of sin. "Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God." The knowledge of God and obedience to God go together. The former is not an act of the intellect only, for the will participates in our relation to God. And a sinful will darkens the intellect, and subjects it to idolatry. Nevertheless, the knowledge of sin involves the knowledge of God; sin can only be sin, in the Biblical sense, in relation to God. Hence, we have a knowledge of God-by faith. The antinomies of "pure reason" confront us with "the ultimate mystery of life." Both God and man defy intellectual comprehen- sion and are shrouded in mystery. (Dr. Kroner's discussion of the mystery of man in chapter nine is a masterpiece.) Con- fronted with this mystery, the intellect gives way to "the religious imagination" which alone is "permitted to enter the darkness of the divine mystery" (The Religious Func- tion of the Imagination, p. 14). Let Dr. Kroner speak for himself: "Imagination owes its power to its peculiar nature. It is not, like sensation or intellect, con- fined to either the realm of sense reality or of intellectual notions and general concepts, but it belongs rather to both realms and it is, therefore, suited to span the gulf between them. Imagination is at home in the sphere of change as well as in the sphere of changeless ideas; it is rooted as much in the visible as in the invisible world:</page><page sequence="3">1943] :BOOK REVIEWS 235 indeed, its peculiar excellency consists exactly in its capacity of making visible what is invisible and of detecting the invisible element in the visible situation. . . . To be sure, the senses and the intellect play an important part in life as well as in science; but they neither embrace the whole nor do they reach to the depths of life. . . . The innermost kernel of life, however, is the relation to the ultimate mystery of life: this relation is the subject of faith. Therefore faith is necessarily imaginative" (The Primacy of Faith, pp. 138, 139). Such is the justification of the imagina- tive language of religion and the Bible. There is an intuition of living reality which can be expressed only in terms of "myths, legends, fairy tales, and so on. . . ." These contents of the religious imagination "can- not fathom the depth of the divine mystery; there is no adequate image of the whole" (The Religious Function of the Imagina- tion, pp. 14-I5). Nevertheless, they over- come the antinomies of reason, and "solve" the problem of the intellect confronted with the mystery of God. This solution is not intellectual; it is imaginative, and possible only by faith. We believe the revelatory power of the imagination. And we believe, not arbitrarily and superstitiously, but un- der the discipline of reason and according to its demand. Faith is the inevitable fulfil- ment of reason confronted with the mystery of life, and the mind recognizes the power of the imagination to reveal what is hidden to itself. Thus reason assents to the venture of the religious imagination and faith into the mystery of God which it recognizes but cannot comprehend. This review has already become lengthy. And I despair of doing Dr. Kroner justice through an exposition much shorter than his own. I hope I have said enough to convince the reader that Dr. Kroner's philosophy of religion deserves serious and reflective study. However, before I close, I wish to raise a few points which I trust Dr. Kroner will clarify in the future. I am mystified rather than enlightened by Dr. Kroner's ap- parently deep intuition that the religious imagination has a secret access to God. I can understand how the imagination can unify fragmentary experiences, but I do not see how it "solves" metaphysical prob- lems and how it penetrates into "ultimate reality." The "mystical" pretensions of the imagination are I think illusory. The con- tents of the religious imagination are re- ceived as "revelation," not through an intui- tive contact with God, but through faith which includes a denial of immediacy in our knowledge of God. I believe Dr. Kroner makes imagination rather than faith primary, and often confuses the two much too readily. I agree that faith and imagination are insep- arable-witness the Bible. But I am led to believe by the same Bible that faith comes first, imagination second; faith endures, the imagination fluctuates; faith is the condi- tion of our encounter with God, imagina- tion the consequence of it. If reason is limited, so is the imagination. What is this imagination which goes beyond reason and is immune to rational criticism? I cannot understand the separation of rea- son and imagination involved in Dr. Kro- ner's philosophy. The imagination sup- plies reason with content, but reason is the judge of the "reality" of this content. Rea- son distinguishes between fancy and imagi- nation, and saves the "religious imagination" from the pretension of an immediate knowl- edge of God. It is reason that recognizes the necessity of faith and keeps the imagi- nation from the illusion of visio dei. Faith is. no less linked with reason than with the imagination. God addresses him- self, as we know from the Bible, to reason as well as to the imagination. The imagina- tion is necessary in objectifying God; rea- son is necessary in hearing and obeying God, which is no less important! There is more reasoning in the Bible than one would ever guess from Dr. Kroner's expositions, and I believe much less "religious imagina- tion," especially in his own esoteric sense of it. I trust Dr. Kroner will clarify our minds</page><page sequence="4">236 BOOK REVIEWS [November on these matters. In the meanwhile no teacher who cares about believing in the Bi- ble can afford to neglect the help he will surely receive from a patient and thorough study of Dr. Kroner's philosophy of religion.
