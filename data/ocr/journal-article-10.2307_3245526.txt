<plain_text><page sequence="1">Postmodern Performance and Technology Johannes Birringer The problematic of postmodernism-and its significance as a cultural struggle over the perception and evaluation of the historical moment in which we live-involves both aesthetic and political questions. These ques- tions can be articulated from various positions across a spectrum of affir- mative or critical discourses that may not, at first sight, seem much con- cerned with the institutional role of theatre in the United States. Much of this discourse and ideological critique, as a repertoire of possibilities for an ongoing inquiry into the social processes of reading and viewing capitalist development and modernization rather than imposing an apparatus of im- ported and domestic concepts of poststructuralism/postmodernism, are made to converge here on the question of how one might have to rethink the idea of performance in the mid-1980s and after. This is especially true at the level of postindustrial information and communication technology and mass-mediational systems. A lot of things have changed since Herbert Blau's manifesto for the "Im- possible Theatre" in the mid-sixties, including all the good or bad inten- tions of both the mainstream theatre and the dispersed radical energies of the Judson Church and Living Theatre generation. The changing artistic practices and modes of cultural production-especially visible within an ongoing experimental performance tradition whose irreducibly complex and heterogeneous history is reflected in the critical readings of PAJ over the last decade (see, for example, the special issue 10/11 on "The American Imagination")-could perhaps be more directly contextualized at the pre- sent conjuncture of "discursive formations" and consumptional patterns if we were able to accept the impossibility of speaking about postmodern per- formance. Included in this view is the conceptual self-understanding of postmodernism as portrayed in recent crisis-theories of knowledge, 221</page><page sequence="2">representation, and performativity by Lyotard, Baudrillard, and Habermas'), which are impossible to speak of outside of what I shall call the "technological scene": the constructed, technological environment that shapes our vision and embodies our relationship with the life-world. This relationship is nearly totally informed by industrial design, the paradigmatically contradictory and multivalent urban space, and the all- pervasive "supertext" of mass communication and media image produc- tion which not only sustains and legitimizes the economic order that has theatricalized itself into a supermarket of spectacles (cf. Guy Debord's Society of the Spectacle, 1977) but reinscribes itself as a technology of viewing conditions and spectator positions in political and cultural pro- cesses. If one wanted to reactivate the Frankfurt School critique of the repetition compulsion and one-dimensionality intrinsic to culture industrial produc- tion, without trying to recuperate Adorno's utopian belief in the radical potential of autonomous aesthetic truth and authenticity, one would need to examine the postmodern "technological scene" in all its pluralistic, heterogeneous, and multi-disciplinary dimensions. This, in order to account for a widespread enthusiasm behaving as if contemporary artistic produc- tion, its marriage of "high" and "low" and of anything else that is mar- riagable, had already achieved the reintegration of art and life which the historical avant-garde once considered fundamental to social transforma- tion. It seems perfectly ironic that it is from the present generation of masterbuilders, the heirs of an ideology of integration which espoused the modern architectural utopia of social-as-technological transformation, that we hear the most despairing obituaries on the defunct "revolutionary" ar- chitecture, on the futile hope for a rehumanizing symbolic praxis within capitalist structures that condition the very function and character of ar- chitectural design. By the time Manfredo Tafuri, in 1973, concluded all that remained in the "drama of architecture" was a flight into pure form, into aesthetic theories or semiologies of its own "language," or into "sublime uselessness,"2 one could already begin to see the emergence of the new spectacular style- mixing of the postmodernists. Their eclecticism of pastiche, of representa- tional kitsch derived from randomly quoted historical forms, betrays a huge learning process, not only from Las Vegas, but from the recent history of the commodification of early postmodern art (pop, op, conceptual, aleatory art, minimalism, intermedia performance, etc.) from reified dramaturgies of montage to be found virtually everywhere in cinematic practices, commer- cial advertising, television programming, exhibitions, sports events, etc., and-perhaps most problematically-from the very theories of read- ing/writing developed by high academic formalisms (semiotics, deconstruc- tion) that sought to expose and dismantle the dominant system of represen- tation. All these practices are mutually informing, of course, and although I cannot 222</page><page sequence="3">offer here a detailed analysis of the diversity and dissemination of artistic experimentation in the recent past, it seems important to point out that the overtly radical project of the poststructuralist critique of representation, as well as the provocative polygamy between semiotics, deconstruction, psychoanalysis and feminist theory, ultimately reveals a prefigurative tendency to formalize a new closed circuit of inter-disciplinary models of textuality which are both totally relevant and totally irrelevant to the visual and performing arts.They are irrelevant, not because the images, the sound, the scenography, the kinetics, and the text of a performance event should or could privilege the notion that there is one specific language or vocabulary of reading/rewriting it,3 but because a postmodern critical discourse on performance cannot be satisfied with the increasingly fashionable techniques of an aesthetic theory of textuality at its politically weakest (Derrida, Barthes, et al.), which doesn't acknowledge its involun- tary regeneration of the same subject of history, the same family drama of capitalist culture, that it has declared defunct. Nevertheless, what we can deduce from such self-protective formalisms is their repressed fear of ir- relevance vis-a-vis a changing public sphere in which we no longer live a part in the drama of alienation that was written into the mise en scene of modernist architecture and exemplified by Beckett's Waiting for Godot, our first modern tragedy of the city. Rather, as Jean Baudrillard observes, our lifestyles have grown used to the soft, homogenizing operations of mass communication and commodification forms (with especially high accelera- tion and self-replication in fashion, entertainment, and art ma'rket) which render "real" formal distinctions (i.e., qualitative perceptions of meaning) and the particularity of aesthetic objects virtually obsolescent categories in view of the emerging non-categorical logic of purely operational sur- faces-the logic of "imagogenetics" and "computergrammatics," for ex- ample, that was so forcefully captured by Nancy Burson's recent exhibition of "Simulacra: Forms without Substance" (International Center of Photography). It is the purpose of my following remarks to open up a discussion of the in- tersections between these impressions of postmodernism, especially as far as social and political dimensions are not abstracted from the lived ex- perience in, and the reception of, the "technological scene," and particular examples of contemporary performance in the City. The larger project for critical theory that I envision for the mid-1980s lies in thinking through the whole discourse of publicity or what Baudrillard calls the "limitless seduc- tion and ecstasy of communication" in order to locate particular moments of experimentation where the different parameters of lived experience and desublimated art can reveal cultural tensions in the repetitive spectacle of consumption. I shall argue that we need to look at a great many levels of ex- perimentation in the architecture of perception in our culture so that we can analyze the determining impact of technology (which is not soft but always potentially violent and in support of social control) on viewing formations, and especially on those formations of perception and pleasure related to image, sound, space-time, and the body. Any critical theory of cultural pro- 223</page><page sequence="4">duction as viewing formation, in other words, addresses the question of dif- ferentiated subject positions in the world of the audience. Another, more radical, question is that of a possible stage beyond the crucial nexus be- tween sexuality and representation that has been consistently explored in recent feminist theory and artistic practice.4 Most of the contributions to the exhibition "Difference: On Representation and Sexuality," curated by Kate Linker and Jane Weinstock for the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, in fact challenged head-on the economy of passive and active voyeurism, spectatorship and narrative identification by mobilizing the gallery space into a confrontation between feminist film theory and the redeployed codes of image-text montage and cinematic technology on the exhibited phototext works themselves. At the same time, there was a cer- tain incohesiveness in the show's terms of address, with regard to the sub- ject matter and to the screening of the independent films (at the Public Theater, in separation from the videotapes inland the New Museum installa- tion), which may point to the more general question of difference between the various media and their viewing conditions within the larger public sphere of cultural operation. I hope it will be understood that my initial reference to the postmodern con- dition of architecture was meant to suggest the inevitable but largely unspoken interrelationship between our technological environment (in- cluding built space) and the structured social space of the theatre itself which, in the earlier moments of its history, used to serve as a concrete and metaphorical site of the perspective representation of power. Today, this in- terrelationship is most obvious when it is most anxiously denied, as in the case of Robert Wilson's new multi-media opera the CIVIL warS, which wants to be a pure vision, a pure formal construction of its own space and time with no particular reference to history and the modes and relations of production that enable it. Wilson, our latter-day Fitzcarraldo who brings the new opera to the jungle of cities (the 12-hour fragment, designed as a col- laboration between theatres in Cologne, Rotterdam, Marseille, Rome, Tokyo, and Minneapolis, was scheduled for the Olympic Arts Festival in Los Angeles but failed to secure sufficient sponsorship), is perhaps the most typical example of an emerging elite of designers, composers, and visual/performing artists that meets the interests of major cultural institu- tions in rebuilding the aura of "avant-garde" performance on a very large scale, involving the glamour of high risks and high budgets and the full range of commodity tie-ins (sale of books, posters, records, videocassettes, T-shirts, touring exhibitions, etc.) available to efficient "art-world" market- ing machinery. Within the trajectory of the postmodern performance culture in the United States one can recognize an almost cynical shift from the adversary ethos of a lived experience of embattled streets, with popular music, happenings, agit prop theatre, etc., as expressions of the civil rights, anti-war, and sex- ual liberation movements, to the more recent institutionalization of the 1980s "Next Wave," a wave that brings back the image of high art, and with 224</page><page sequence="5">L-- I aal ='7 C,) 0i I! iQ .4im 05.:. ... .... .

This shift from street and SoHo loft to BAM and Lincoln Center is not even surprising if one remembers that it was in the 1960s when McLuhan envisioned the technological aesthetic of the new televi- sion, video, and computer society, and when performance artists within the minimal and conceptual art context began to explore the intermedial language of the future, the dance of electricity. Today, at a time when so many voices speak of the end of history, one can't fail to see the long-term impact of experimental performance from the earlier days of Judson Church, The Kitchen, The Performing Garage, or Ellen Stewart's Cafe La Mama, even though the current appeal of quasi- cultic large-scale image spectacles (Laurie Anderson) or high-tech operas (Robert Wilson, Philip Glass) is explicable less in terms of the progression of artistic practices themselves than in relation to changed viewing condi- tions and new parameters of sensibility dictated by all those institutional practices of constructing, processing, and circulating images of the world for us (network and cable TV, video, cinema, MTV, advertising, the press, etc.) that overlap with the galleries, the museums, and the stages. Given the constant redistribution and recontextualization of material from one medium to another, with the transposition of the performance-style TV music video of Prince's "Let's Go Crazy" ("live" footage from a concert) to 225</page><page sequence="6">the Purple Rain version in 35mm as one striking example that, as far as I can tell, has already influenced a choreography of flashdancing on the stage, it becomes increasingly disingenuous to claim that directors/stage-designers like Wilson have changed the way we see "images" and experience space- time, light, color, volume, and movement in the theatre. In the promotional footnotes to the Cambridge ART's reproduction of the German section of the CIVIL warS we read that Wilson's theatrical techniqe is significantly dif- ferent from "customary dramatic forms" since, "like a dream or a hallucina- tion, the action of a Wilson 'play' takes shape, dissolves, overlaps, fragments, and reforms. Two or three 'stories' may be told simultaneously...." Such dreamwork has been with us for quite a while, on stage and on the screen, and if the habits of seeing were really an issue, one could as well turn to TV advertisements and video simulations as the revolutionizers of our spatial and temporal perception. In fact, one might argue that our access to the slowed-down action, the repetitions, and the structural asymmetry of image, music, sound in Wilson's work is largely determined by the repetitive reformulations (within the endless flow of text) of unfulfilled desire that we often experience in watching the fragmented and interrupted fiction or sports event on television. Furthermore, the representation of representaton-as-technological manipulation of image, voice, and music tracks has been second nature to recent video art (cf. Max Almy's Leaving the 20th Century) which draws on customary dramatic forms and narrational strategies only to break down all familiar spectator positions (masculine and feminine) by electronically "wiping" away the human body and voice into color blotches, mosaic effects, abstract noise. And that is a radical practice, since the body and the voice of the "star" re- main the primary focus in commercial TV and, not surprisingly, in MTV, despite the latter's pseudo-anarchic visual styles. The specific challenge of Baudrillard's view of the media's "limitless seduc- tion" lies in his claim that the automatic self-referentiality of the technological simulation of the world leads to the end of any coherent view- point or subjectivity, of any epistemology arranged in spatial terms and dependent on distinctions between subject and object, the real and the im- aginary, the body and its projections. I would argue instead that the seduc- tive appearance of endless technological semiosis has certain limits even if it were already possible to assume that the electronic mass media's total penetration of culture not only changes perception and social behavior but indeed creates a new theoretical "space" (contemporaneity, simultaneity) in which everything is subject to simulation. Undoubtedly, that would mean the end of the theatre of representation, as Baudrillard concludes. But among the media that are still bounded by the symbolic markers of "customary dramatic forms" as well as by non-private, concrete social veiwing situations, the theatre's structural resistance to semiological reduction provides a site for dynamic cultural conflict-especially when its non-dramatic, non-narrative, non-linear, and "abstract" performances behave as if there were no boundaries. When I say "dynamic cultural con- flict" I mean to suggest that the unavoidable commodification of so-called 226</page><page sequence="7">avant-garde performances, and their insertion into a material network of ideological pressures, does not prevent them from showing how the theatre, after its primary social function as the medium of "capitalist realism"5 has been subsumed by cinema and television, can continue to engage the specific phenomenal presence of its actors, dancers, and singers on the stage without assuming, however (as Walter Benjamin and Antonin Artaud did, and a whole tradition of modernist criticism after them), that the representation of this presence is essentially different from technological representation. In other words, to use my initial metaphor of the "architecture of percep- tion," postmodern experimental performance generally presupposes our conflicted sensory experiences (which will differ by race and age, class and gender) of the technological scene and mobilizes audio-visual techniques of abstraction against the no longer clearly defined/confined phenom- enological reality of the stage. The theatre's social function, therefore, will need to be reconsidered, and its current predilection for myth and science-fiction more closely analyzed. When Achim Freyer, whose most recent work is a "scenic interpretation" of Handel's oratorio The Messiah (which had never been theatrically perform- ed), directed and designed the Stuttgart premiere of Philip Glass's new THE GAMES [Meredith Monk &amp; Ping Chong] :?:?~:::::i--.:: ::::d?: s?i:-:::~:a-:?i::~i_:::: ::.,:: ::?::j':: :::::::.:: t -?:;:R:? ???:?:: ??:::::-:.:?::- ::"::~:::::? ~-C :::.:::: : :::::.:j:::j,:j?::i:::i:_??::::: ? j ;.:::::::: : :: ??l:i??i:::':ii::::::-?::i:: ;::;:::::l:::,a: :??:,::,:i:::P : p) -?i:?I $::i-: -i:i:8 r?j::::::-::i::-::,~?ji.~~~: ::~::::::::~~-::?::: -??-?:::;?:?::l?:r::_::i?::::::s:-: ::: :-j::: :::-: N ? ~-*rpllhparmasos~sss~asso;: :X-~VR~YY~ ^~~i : P ::::?:?:?:~i;i ;:: .?::?j:.::::::j:i :Ili:: -::?.::?-,::i: :?.:?,:.-~::8:?::-??:,_i --?;?- ii8::.:i :::::::i:::: :L':::::?--~:::?i:??i:::::::r:::::::"ii:: :I:::I: -~~_:I:?:?:?i:::?:::: :*:,j,:i:j, - P ?f::: :?:??xlr:?r? ~?(?-:~B~?~a~absOgBg.. :" :* ~,,,:: J r ::-::j:x *rra, 227</page><page sequence="8">opera Akhnaten last year, he used a huge cubical holograph for the funeral scene and, at the end of the last act, placed the group of present-day tourists, which wanders across the excavation site of the ancient Egyptian city, behind a blue gauze that made the performers appear like figures in an aquarium. Throughout the Stuttgart performance, Freyer's scenic design set its tableaux or moving pictures (reminiscent of the idea of the stills "concert" built on the score Glass wrote for The Photographer) into metaphorical spaces whose grandiose and unreal architecture seemed to come alive purely through the light and the music. Within the dark blue and bright yellow spaces behind the transparent screen, the constitution of perceived presence-the presence of human figures or plastic objects -was largely a composite effect of the light and sound modulations. I felt that the sensuous flow of Glass's repetitive polymelodic music very nearly dissolved the spatial boundaries with which Freyer's "landscapes" of Egyp- tian myth framed the actors. The actors themselves assumed a plasticity that made me think of Artaud's "animated hieroglyphs." And these hieroglyphs seemed to float in an unmeasurable aural-temporal dimension where the ecstatically visible is no longer recognizable. This may sound paradoxical. But I consider the spectacular performance of Akhnaten a significant experiment to the extent that it demonstrated the destructuring power of endlessly re-producible, omnipresent music/noise, its problematic relationship to the production of regressive fantasies, and the theatre's ultimately self-destructive denial of the spatial/perceptual limits that are its specific conditions of communication. The crucial limit or out-line in the theatre used to be, and still is, the actor's body-the source of action, the place of articulation, where language, history, the world out- side [bodiliness] is incorporated, where something will be shown that the spectator can perceive in reciprocal relation to the scale of proportion of- fered by the body. The performing body, however subjected to conventions of viewing and to the discursive and representational structures from within which it speaks, is the primary physical condition for a shared experience of the social relations of theatre. The recent history of postmodern ex- perimental performance suggests that the cultural determinations of the boundaries of (shared?) experience have been transformed, and that the spaceship theatre (e.g., Meredith Monk/Ping Chong's sci-fi opera The Games) is ready to leave the twentieth century after having dis-located the human actor into technologically abstracted totalities, or "hypereal" spaces, that are beyond and above a spectator's particular moment of view- ing. In the case of Wilson's C/VIL warS one can almost speak of the architec- turalization of the body: androgynous actors, hanging from the ceiling behind-or standing motionless in front of-the proscenium-sized scrim on which overdimensional images of human faces are projected, appear as surface material, as if built into the space. The total design-in-motion, with its multiple stage pictures, constantly changing screen projections, text- collages, and soundscapes, cannot be perceived coherently or logically. 228</page><page sequence="9">One feels overwhelmed, oppressed, excited, perhaps less by the incoherent visual scale than by the disjunctions between different time scales (filmic time, real time, musical time) which directly affect the way one perceives the actors temporally, separate from their bodies, separate from the voices that trickle from the loudspeakers scattered around the auditorium. One can no longer speak of actors, then, but perhaps it is not possible either to go so far as to compare their demotivated "presence" to the electronically constructed non-sexual human images in recent videos, or to the "replicants" and clones that turn up in new sci-fi films (Blade Runner) which seem to deal less with the future than with the present, with Los Angeles and Hollywood, for example. And yet, all these emerging viewing formations (including the slick an- drogyny promoted in MTV) must be considered in relation to the dis- location of the actor-in-performance that I have described, since it is quite likely that the idea of live performance in the theatre, after the general inva- sion of technological "access codes,"8 will be consumed by postmodernist space operas in which the "role" of the performer can be randomly reproduced, recorded (filmed), and distributed across the entire image/ sound apparatus-inviting thespectator's earto identify with the spectacle. (This is not paradoxical as far as I can judge from my observation of the consumption of MTV, which is one of listening, not watching, as well as from my recent experiences in the New York "Danceteria," where cult films, such as The Road Warrior, are shown without sound on more than two dozen video screens that nobody watches, while everybody seems immers- ed in listening to the various rock/new music concerts that are going on simultaneously on several floors. In any case, the silent images of the Road Warrior in a totally dominant sonic environment which strongly suggests the obsolescence of language and communication in the traditional sense, demand analysis in a separate essay.) While this emphasis on the ear might imply the construction of a feminine spectator position of interiority and regression (a problem of much concern to film critics at present), it describes, perhaps more generally, an infantile scenario, far removed from the collective critical activity Brecht expected in response to the new epic opera that would abandon the "witchcraft" of the old, and equally far removed from Heiner Mi"ller's political idea of the theatre as a laboratory of the social imagination. And yet, the question of how one listens to Wilson's architectural abstractions is redeterminable (and not determined) precisely through the obvious ideological contradictions built into the scenario of the CIVIL warS, into its imaginary "Prussian history" that ends with a hysterical epilogue on the History of Mankind during which we are offered undifferentiated images of mythical, anthropomorphic, historical, and literary figures. Sound begins to fill the air, furiously, signifying nothing. The "Snow Owl"screeches (Hopi prophecies, as the program indicates), the "Earth Mother" mutters a Grimm fairy tale, "King Lear" quotes himself, speaking to the blind ("Look with thine ears.. ."), and a tall black shape that looks like Abe Lincoln recites Ecclesiastes in Latin: "tempus est."

The recovery of a social content implies reconceiving the am- bivalent relationship between the theatrical body of the actor and the technological representations by which it is hollowed out. One form of critical engagement with this ambivalence was demonstrated by Falso Movimento, one of the three "post-avant-garde" groups that performed at La Mama's New Italian Theatre Festival last fall. Their multi-media work Otello, directed by Mario Martone with a music score composed and/or rear- ranged by Peter Gordon, had little to do with Verdi's nineteenth-century opera or with Shakespeare's tragedy, but they used its movement of ironic allusions back into the drama of jealousy and passion as a kind of musical/ rhythmical passage through technologically simulated urban landscapes (projected against movable screens as well as actual painted back-drops). It was also a voyage through time, imaging the transformations of Otello's "passion" in changing relationships between the choreographed move- ment of the three main characters (Otello, lago, Desdemona) and the dif- ferent semantic contents of the architectural designs.The performers themselves had each designed a specific gestus or outline (geometric phrases) for their movement and dance interpretation of that voyage, and their most striking physicalizations occurred when the extensions of the body-in-space melted into the shadows their silhouettes cast on the moving screens. The slide projections of luminous cityscapes would often seem to penetrate their bodies, but one could not lose sight of the difference be- tween the physical body and the fabricated illusionistic surfaces of reality, although that "exterior" design was shown to be already always in-for- mative and impressive on the social "character" of the body. 230</page><page sequence="11">This architecturalization of the body, revealing the metainstitutional power of the city/public space as a social technology, stood in a complicated dialectical relationship to the erotic, sensual contact between performers and audience, mirrored in the almost wordless sexual power shared by Desdemona, Otello, and lago. If the sado-masochistic exchanges between the three, which led to the predictable (but melodramatically exaggerated) murder, meant to suggest the larger psycho-social dialectic of power within which they are bound, the performance sought to allegorize an imagined source of "passion" (in the real body? the images? the spectator?) by the use of an extraordinarily aggressive and dissonant sonic environment. Gor- don's score, mixing electronically distorted recordings of the Verdi opera with overdubbed acoustical and electronic instruments, was so powerfully dominant that the illusion of one's individual resistance to it became part of Otello, and perhaps I can say that we became witnesses/victims of something very real-some phantom fear that Otello must strangle-which is part of our projections, our desires, and our deathly confusion in the kind of society we live in. We understand the fascinating violence of the re-pro- ductive system, although we may not always hear/see as clearly as in this performance, how the false movements and lines of aggression are "built" into our libidinal and political economy. If the theatre cannot complete the avant-garde project and change the historical subject for whom, at this point, it can only represent the technological destructuration of "aesthetic-communicative rationality" (Habermas), it can at least explore the critical limits of simulation and perception in the sense in which the "post-avant-garde" peformances at La Mama searched for symbolic relationships between the energies of the body and the theatricality of architecture. Furthermore, the dis-location of the actor-perhaps a specific phenomenon of the Next Wave in the United States-needs to be seen in the context of a postmodernist trend towards a fetishization of surfaces which "wipes" the critical and social relations to the specific historical conditions of the production of a work. I suggest, therefore, that we need to give more attention to those postmodern perfor- mances that do not let the multi-media apparatus represent itself to itself, but react against that mise en abyme by foregrounding, and experimenting with, the transformable theatricality of body and voice in real space- time-and thus addressing the actually changing conditions of representa- tion for social subjects that we experience today. These conditions, as I have tried to argue here, may turn us more and more into the automatized somnambulists and designed objects that people Wilson's affirmative postmodern spectacles. But they can be engaged dif- ferently by collaborative artistic practices (e.g., in the increasingly popular dance-theatre and music-theatre performances) that care about the context-specific, social, and ethnic identities of the body and the subject of performance, and that-even more anachronistically-insist on an ethics of (re)productive choice. Such insistence stands in contradiction to the globalizing or "intertextualizing" abstractions of advanced technologies 231</page><page sequence="12">?::j:iiil -ii~i'iiiiiii~iiiii '''' ................i:: i ..... i :::!,  ii! .......... 4 i.-:::u:- --~~~! : iil ::__:: i:: . : PINA BAUSCH WUPPERTALER TANZTHEATER that are themselves forms of patriarchal power, as feminist critics rightly point out.7 Among the most significant compositional and choreographic experiments that were staged in New York during the last 12 months I would count the Odin Teatret's archeology of a very specific, grown relation to an acting tradition (i.e., a political tradition) in Brecht's Ashes 2 (La Mama), Martha Clarke's and Richard Peaslee's musical dance interpretation of a Bosch painting in The Garden of Earthly Delights (St. Clement's), Sankai Juku's Buto-inspired body transformations in Kinkan Shonen (City Center), Meredith Monk's vocal concert at Carnegie Hall as well as the revival of her theatre work Quarry (La Mama), and the Wuppertaler Tanztheater's car- nivalistic "rehearsal" of childhood memories in 1980 (BAM). It is hardly ac- cidental that the most consistent and organically grown exploration of the theatricality of expressive performance, showing us a possible future stage for the "postmodern condition," comes from two women artists, Meredith Monk and Pina Bausch. Both have used technological media in various ways, only to discover that the medium is not the message, and that if the theatre wishes to survive as a social institution, it may have to resist the masculinist aesthetic dream of a new "technological sublime" (Lyotard) which would manifest the unpresentable (the immaterial) not just as form without substance, but as form without form. Lyotard's dream is currently exhibited under the name "lmmateriaux"-a theatrical installation presented by the "Centre de creation industrielle" at the Beaubourg in Paris. L'effet Baudrillard? 232</page><page sequence="13">The undiminished range of possibilities for postmodern performers to light out for new political territories stretches, at the least, from the very real and presentable world of continuing discoveries that Meredith Monk unearths in her vocal and ritual memory plays (Dolmen Music, Quarry), or that Pina Bausch's dancers retrieve from the underground of self-repression and social instrumentalization (Kontakthof, 1980) to the electronic display world of Laurie Anderson's United States. Unearthing and retrieving performance modes that are already beyond the coordinates of technological represen- tation may be one way in which the theatre of the 1980s could help us to see, and listen to, our own conditioning. Another way to recover a dis- located audience would be the "Trojan Horse strategy" that the new direc- tor of the new American National Theatre has proposed (and which I don't care to discuss): "Re-invent the world.... ANT will present Shakespeare. And musicals. Late-breaking developments from Ancient Greece. Little family plays. Ravishing and empty spectacles.... Mysteries, romances, and the heroic." NOTES: 'Cf.
