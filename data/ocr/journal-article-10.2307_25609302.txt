<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews_ Early Urbanism on the Syrian Euphrates, by Lisa Cooper. New York: Routledge, 2006. xix + 313 pp., 82 figures, 3 tables. Cloth. $125.00. Just a mere generation ago, little or nothing of certainty could be said about Syria's involvement in the origin of cit ies. There has, however, been a dramatic increase of archae ological investigations along both banks of the Euphrates River which have spawned many studies concerning ancient Syrian urbanism (e.g., Akkermans and Schwartz 2003; Stein 1999). Much of this was because of the numerous salvage projects along the Euphrates River that were initiated in response to the construction of the Tabqa and Tishreen Dams that threatened to ruin many sites, some of which are presently submerged under water. Not only has it been shown that Syria was heavily involved in urbanism in the early third millennium, cuneiform texts dated to the latter half of the third millennium have been found at a number of sites, including an administrative archive at Tell Bey dar. Moreover, the lavish tombs at Tell Banat attest to the com plex cultures in this region. Further, the Euphrates Valley played a major role in the dry-farming system in northern Mesopotamia (see Wilkinson 2004). It is precisely this in crease in knowledge that has precipitated Lisa Cooper's excellent summary concerning Syria's involvement in the origin of cities. She is uniquely qualified in this venture, as she has worked on the pottery and chronology of Middle Bronze Age northern Syria, and has participated in archae ological projects at Tell Banat, Tell Amarna, and Tell es Sweyhat (1995-2000). Cooper concentrates her volume on 12 salvage sites along the Upper Euphrates River that delineate develop ments in the third millennium b.c. in Syria (and in the Eu phrates basin of southeastern Turkey). These sites include Carchemish, Tell Ahmar, Tell Banat, Tell es-Sweyhat, Tell Hadidi, Munbaqa, Tell Selenkahiye, and Emar, among others. She organizes this work in a thematic manner, with chapters on the environment and subsistence; settlement and sociopolitical structure; the defense of Early Bronze Age cities; large-scale secular buildings; communal places of worship; crafts and craft production; and death, funerary monuments, and ancestor cults. Cooper argues that the Syrian urban centers, though dwarfed in size by their Early Dynastic southern counter parts, contained lavish tombs and monumental architecture and thus exhibited many salient characteristics of urban ism. However, rather than comprising a hierarchical sys tem of settlements similar to ones encountered in the south, the Upper Euphrates, Cooper concludes, was more "heter archical" in nature, with a variety of sites of differing sizes and functions. This was due in part to environmental con siderations (i.e., the fragmented landscape and narrow river valley which limited settlement growth). These smaller settlements were somewhat autonomous in nature, accord ing to Cooper, a unique feature in the ancient Near East. However, these small settlements (often citadels with an upper and lower town) often had massive defensive systems (e.g., glacis, buttresses, and ramparts), implying a consid erable amount of planning, a pooling of organized labor, and a preoccupation with protecting their assets. Among the unique things about the domestic architec ture of these sites are the numerous anthropomorphic and animal terracotta figurines from Tell es-Sweyhat which Cooper sees as reflective of vehicles of sympathetic magic. These items are often without mouths, and Cooper follows Petty, who has concluded that this signifies that the item was a product of the artisan's hand, and not a divine rep resentation that could be "enlivened" (Petty 2004: 197; see now Petty 2006). The figurines were also found predomi nantly broken, many of them, it appears, done on purpose. Arguably the most interesting secular buildings in this period are found at Tell Ban at. Oddly, these special build ings were not found at the high point of the mound, but in a low, flat area near the potters' quarter. Cooper argues that the site itself probably functioned as a mortuary center, as no temples have been associated with it. However, unlike the large urban center of Ebla, many sites along the Eu phrates (e.g., Tell Banat and Tell es-Sweyhat) do not ex hibit characteristics of a centralized bureaucracy. In fact, the architecture at each site had its own distinctions in this regard. The Syrian Euphrates religious structures also exemplify unique religious traditions, although some reli gious stelae (like the one from Tell Halawa B) show a blend of Mesopotamian and north Syrian artistic styles. Large scale temples, however, show a trend toward standardi zation, although an overall "local flavor" is still evident. Cooper concludes that there were two different ideological religious traditions that permeated the region. Early third millennium Syrian temples reflect the indigenous agricul tural character of the Euphrates area. However, funerary monuments such as the one at Tell Banat may reflect the mobile character of many of the inhabitants and may have been employed as symbols of tribal ancestors. The sites in the Upper Euphrates region of Syria ex hibited a great deal of high-intensity factory production and numerous exotic craft items, especially at Tell Banat. Once again, the craft production is different than in the south (and at Ebla), where there were "elite" institutional ized factories. Instead, the Upper Euphrates sites may have had state-owned large-scale facilities, but probably did not generate a comparatively large amount of revenue. Cooper argues against the traditional interpretation of third-millennium north Syrian mortuary ceramic items as filled with food and drink in order to sustain the dead. Instead, they may have been used by the living participants at a funerary feast in honor of the dead (after Peltenberg in 93</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 352 press). Unique among the artifacts are stone statuettes at Tell Selenkahiye which Cooper posits may have been rep resentations of the deceased. Moreover, the mortuary com plex at Banat is unique and has no obvious parallels with other ancient Near Eastern sites. In fact, Cooper (following Porter) sees the White Monument at Tell Banat as a monu ment to a corporate group of anonymous ancestors, similar to the kispum rites at Mari (Porter 2002: 167). The kin based tribal-based structure at Banat is assumed by the excavators, where the elites were tied to the community by kinship ties. In sum, Cooper argues that the sites along the Euphra tes were largely autonomous and not under the control of a greater authority. The cities had a persistent tribal char acter (e.g., loosely confederated nomadic kinship groups) and thus never became full state systems, as exemplified by urban centers in southern Mesopotamia and by some what isolated centers in Syria (e.g., Mari and Ebla). Thus, she concludes that these centers were tribal-based socio political structures. Though there is evidence of elite status (e.g., the acropolis complex at Tell es-Sweyhat and the mortuary complex at Tell Banat), she does not see this as evidence of governmental central control. Cooper's work is a welcome addition to the emerging scholarly literature concerning the Syrian Euphrates. She has a decided mastery of the material, much of which is only found in preliminary reports. Thus, her synthesis is very crucial to furthering our knowledge of ancient Syria, now known to be a significant player in the ancient Near East in the third millennium. Nevertheless, Cooper could have provided a wider historical context for Syria. For example, it is well known that Syria experienced urban development during the fourth millennium (in conjunction with the Uruk expansion). She does not, however, develop the historical continuity between the first and second ur banizations. Furthermore, the political and cultural con nection between the large states of Mari, Tuttul, and Ebla (where like funerary remains have been discovered) and the smaller Euphrates centers is not adequately addressed. Lastly, there is no doubt that future scholarship on the region will understandably modify (and even overhaul) her somewhat uncritical summations concerning the socio political systems of the Euphrates. However, these minor criticisms pale in comparison to this masterful and indis pensable synthesis which goes far to further our under standing of ancient Syria.
