<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prints, Drawings, and Photographs Charles Sheeler (American, 1883-1965) Wheels, 1939 Photograph, silver print, 6V2 x 91/2 in. (16.5 x 24.2 cm.) Gift of William H. and Saundra B. Lane. 1983.696 This famous photograph is one of many Sheeler works containing twentieth-century industrial motifs and details. It is related closely to a painting titled Rolling Power of the same year, now in the Smith College Museum of Art. Sheeler used the photograph in part as a model for his oil painting, saying that he "couldn't camp by [the locomotive] for the three months I required to paint it." The painting was commis- sioned by Fortune magazine as part of a series of six to illustrate an article called "Power" for its December 1940 issue. Sheeler had photographed throughout his career, first executing architectural views in 1912. The art of photography existed side by side with his painting and drawing, constantly interacting with those disciplines, yet forming a distinct and influential body of work in its own right. His subjects included country and city architecture, industrial images, and studies of works of art, particularly sculpture. (Another subject from a famous series of Chartres Cathe- dral has also been given by Mr. and Mrs. Lane.) This very print of Wheels was used by the pho- tographer Edward Weston to illustrate his article on photography in the Encyclopedia Britannica. Jim Dine (American, 1935-) Tree ( The Kimono), 1 980 Charcoal and acrylic with rubbing on joined sheets of yellow paper, 71 V2 x 61 in. (181.6 x 155 cm.) Anonymous Gift. 1984.42 Since the early 1960s, several recurring themes have characterized many of Jim Dine's paint- ings and works of art on paper - the most familiar being tools, hearts, and robes. He has recently executed a group of works exploring the anthropomorphic form of a tree, originally inspired by a gnarled apple tree near his Ver- mont studio. The Boston drawing is one of the major works on paper from this series; with the scale and complexity of a painting, it barely con- tains the thrashing dark form of the tree silhouetted by a light blue field. At some places, Dine has rubbed and scraped the paper sur- face; at others, he has built up multiple layers of charcoal and paint into a dense surface. Shaped in the form of a Japanese kimono, and thus possessing an undeniable relationship to Dine's robes (often presented as self-portraits), this tree "portrait" also suggests a female image. The branches evoke both arms and hair encircling the central trunk (or torso), creating a vivid sense of movement. At the same time, the kimono device enables the artist to exploit the ambiguity between a two-dimensional design and a three-dimensional figure study. 34</page><page sequence="2">Edgar Degas (French, 1834-1917) Self-Portrait, 1857 Etching and drypoint, third state, 9Viex 5% in. (23.0 X 14.4 cm.) Katherine E. Bullard Fund in Memory of Francis Bullard and Proceeds from the Sale of Duplicate Prints. 1983.306 Mary Cassatt at the Louvre: The Paintings Gal- lery, 1879-1880 Etching, drypoint, and aquatint, fifth state, 1 115/i6 X 5 in. (30.3x12.7 cm.) Katherine E. Bullard Fund in Memory of Francis Bullard and Proceeds from the Sale of Duplicate Prints. 1983.309 Printmaking was for Edgar Degas primarily a personal activity; thus, the number of superla- tive examples of his prints available on the art market is very small. Of more than sixty prints, there exist only a few impressions of each, and many states are known in only a single impres- sion. In 1983 the M FA had an exceptional opportunity to acquire nine etchings and four lithographs, adding substantially to an existing group of seventeen prints. Their acquisition raises the Museum's collection of Degas prints to among the five largest in this country. Included in the group is one unique aquatint {On Stage II), one unique state of a lithograph (Out of the Bath [large version]), and several of his best-known images. The self-portrait was almost certainly executed in Rome during the young artist's period of study there in 1857. It reveals Degas's masterly draftsmanship - academic in training, yet per- sonally expressive in effect. The direct, assured gaze and the dramatic use of light and shade are reminiscent of certain of Rembrandt's self- portraits. Though there are several drawn and painted portraits of himself, this was the only printed one Degas made. Another well-known print, related closely to the painting A Visit to the Museum (also in the M FA collections) and to works in other media, depicts the painter Mary Cassati and probably her sister Lydia on a visit to the galleries of the Louvre. Executed in the period from 1879 to 1880, this work progressed through twenty dif- ferent states, the Boston impression being from the fifth. The essential composition remained the same throughout, as Degas worked inten- sively on the relationships of shape, pattern, and tone. In format and composition the image shows the influence of Japanese color wood- cuts, particularly the "pillar" prints, which Degas very much admired. The entire body of Degas's graphic work in prints will be examined in an international exhi- bition and published in a catalogue organized by the Department of Prints, Drawings, and Photo- graphs in 1984-1985. 35</page></plain_text>
