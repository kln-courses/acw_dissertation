DICKINSON, ANDREW BARTON and RICHARD SHUTLER JR. Abstract Archaeological research in the Kingdom of Tonga over the past four decades illustrates a widespread distribution of Lapita coloniser sites throughout the archipelago. A 1999 re-excavation and assessment of the Nukuleka (To 2) and Havateiho (To 5) sites on Fanga 'Uta Lagoon on the southern island of Tongatapu, as well as survey of the Lapita-age paleoshoreline of the lagoon, pro- vide new insights on old problems relating to first human settle- ment. The Tongatapu results are compared to Lapita site data recovered from the Havapai island group between 1995 and 1997. Inferences subsequently are made on the broader issues of Tongan chronology, settlement progression, material culture technologies, settlement pattern and economy. Introduction Dentate stamped ceramics associated with "kitchen mid- dens" were documented by McKern (1929:Plate VI) in the Kingdom of Tonga during his surveys of 1920/1921. The implications of this pottery remained unknown until Golson (1961), recognizing the stylistic similarities of these sherds with others from New Caledonia and Samoa, provided a conceptual foundation for an ances- tral Lapita culture in eastern Melanesia and western Polynesia. To gather supportive data for these claims, one of Golson's doctoral students, Jens Poulsen, was sent to Tonga in 1963/1964. Poulsen's (1967, 1987) success in finding and excavating Lapita sites around the Fanga 'Uta Lagoon on the island of Tongatapu ensured that Tongan materials figured prominently in later definitions of the Lapita period (Green 1979; Kirch 1997). Since Poulsen's study, there have been other archaeo- logical projects in which Lapita period sites have been recorded or excavated in the Kingdom. Kirch (1988) on Niuatoputapu in the far north, Dye (1988a) in the central islands of Havapai, and Groube (1971) and Spennemann (1986,1989) on Tongatapu have added to our inventory and understanding of Lapita prehistory (Figure 1). Individually and collectively these projects raise as many questions as they resolve. Even such basic issues as chronology, settlement progression, adaptation and anthropogenic impacts on small island ecosystems have DVB, AB, RS: Department of Archaeology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby B.C., Canada V5A 1S6; WRD: Department of Geosciences, University of Arizona, Tucson AZ, USA 85723 been at the centre of debate, or remain to be worked out (Burley 1998a:349-359). Beginning in 1995, these ques- tions formed the core of a research design for an archae- ological study of Lapita colonisation in the Havapai islands (Burley 1996, 1999). In 1999, and in recognition of the critical importance of Tongatapu to the initial set- tlement of the archipelago, we returned to Fanga vUta Lagoon and began a program of data recovery and site reassessment. Much of the Havapai data and consequential interpre- tations are documented in other publications (Burley 1998a, 1999; Burley et al 1995, 1999; Dickinson et al .1994, 1999; Flenley et al. 1999; Steadman 1999). In the following paper we focus predominantly on the more recent work on Tongatapu with a comparison and inte- gration of Tongatapu and Havapai results taken up in derivative discussion. The latter facilitates inferential statements on issues of chronology, material culture, set- tlement pattern as well as settlement process and its impact for the archipelago as a whole. Tongatapu - an archaeology of the sacred south Literally translated as sacred south, Tongatapu has been central to the settlement and political landscape of Tonga throughout prehistory (Spennemann 1989, Burley 1998a). It is the largest island in the archipelago, with a distance of 34 km from east to west and a land mass in excess of 260 km2. Fanga vUta Lagoon, an extensive embayment with two principal arms and a narrow and relatively shallow access to the sea, dominates much of the geography of the central leeward coast. While today this body of water is in part brackish and fringed with a thick growth of mangrove, the abundant presence of both Lapita and Plainware shell midden sites illustrates a quite different geography at the time of initial settlement (also see Ellison 1989). Previous archaeological research on the ceramic pre- history of Tongatapu has been considerable, with projects by Golson (1957), L. and H. Birks (Golson 1961), Poulsen (1967, 1987), Groube (1971) and Spennemann (1986, 1989). Poulsen's studies, nevertheless, provide the dominant data set upon which the Tongan Lapita period was and continues to be defined. During his one year of field studies, he recovered over 7000 diagnostic sherds from excavations of 179 m2 at six different sites. Sherd 89</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

The open water gap between Vanuatu and Fiji serves as a boundary between western and eastern Lapita provinces. assemblages were seriated based on discretely delineated site "horizons" allowing the definition of early, middle and late ceramic periods for Tonga. This horizon-based chronology was later evaluated by Spennemann (1989) who declared it "robust", and aspects of it have been incorporated into comparative ceramic analyses by Best (1984:618) and Dye (1996). Spennemann and Head (1997:1054) also have used the results as a predictive tool for determination of absolute age. Despite the existing body of information for Tongatapu Lapita sites, direct comparisons of these data to those from Havapai have been difficult. Excavation strategies and methods employed by Poulsen in the 1960s were ill-suited to the fine-grained recovery of fau- nal remains, a principal issue for Ha'apai research and an integral data set for measuring human impact on island ecology. Poulsen (1987:11) himself raised concerns over the degree of site disturbances he encountered and the large potential for stratigraphie mixing. Horizon sorted assemblages and seriation results might thus be ques- tioned. And radiocarbon dates for Tongatapu sites, in spite of recent efforts by Spennemann and Head (1997) to develop a lagoon specific reservoir correction for shell measurements, continue to be confusing. If we are to resolve questions of settlement origins, progression, and inter-island relationships within the archipelago, undis- puted site chronologies are required. Other concerns and issues could be listed. To refine and add to the Tongatapu data set, a project to gather faunal and other data from stratigraphically controlled excavation samples was proposed for sites on Fanga vUta Lagoon. A 1998 re-examination of Poulsen 's ceramic collections stored at the Australian National University, and subsequent site visits, led us to focus concern on two locations - Nukuleka (To 2) and Havateiho (To 5). Both sites were associated with the early Lapita ceramic horizon identified by Poulsen, and both were believed to have intact faunal assemblages (Bland and Reed 1987). Also undertaken during the field project was a survey for and mapping of the circa 3000 year old Fanga vUta Lagoon shoreline. The results of this study are essential to the reliable inference of site context and early settlement distributions. Field research was undertaken in Tonga between May and August of 1999. The following provides an overview of the work, begin- ning with the paleoshoreline study. The Lapita Shoreline of Fanga yUta Lagoon Geoarchaeological study of paleoshorelines and wave cut notches throughout Tonga, and consideration of geo- logical and archaeological data elsewhere, have led us to propose a model of hydro-isostatic sea level change for the Pacific basin (Dickinson et al. 1994). Following a mid-Holocene highstand peak in sea levels of between 2.1 and 2.6 m, sea levels possibly as much 2 m higher than present continued to characterize Tonga when first Lapita peoples arrived. Variant rates and directions of emergence or subsidence for different structural blocks along the length of the archipelago, and the absence of a rate for the post highstand drawdown, make it difficult to consistently retrodict paleoshoreline locations for first human settlement for any given island (Dickinson et al. 1999). For Tongatapu, however, isotopie dating of emer- gent mid-Holocene reef flats combined with uranium- series and radiocarbon methods provides considerable insight into sequent events for the post 5000 BP period (Taylor and Bloom 1977; Taylor 1978; Spennemann 1997; Dickinson et al. 1999). 90 Reef Island^ 170o 180o 170o i t» '^ REMOTE Lapita Site Santa Cruz · α '% inoQ. 10S α · ' OCEANIA inoQ. 10S Tikopia ' » ^·· -*.. o '^ .../" 'Uvea ' ^ Futu#na Sana»? j.

In a cove on the windward coast only 3 km from the head of the west arm of Fanga vUta Lagoon, the difference in elevation between a well preserved mid-Holocene paleonotch and the active shoreline notch, developed at modern high tide level, was scaled directly at 2.6 m. Emergent coralline lime- stone 6 km from the mouth of the east arm of Fanga 'Uta Lagoon stands 2.2 m above the modern reef flat. Consequently, a figure in the range of 2.2-2.6 m is accepted as being reflective of the net post-mid- Holocene emergence of the lagoon. The relative position of Lapita archaeological sites allows us to calculate the post-Lapita period emergence of the lagoon as 1.2 to 1.4 m. Given the spring tidal range of 1.2 m for Tongatapu, this estimate implies that high tide level during Lapita times had not yet dropped below the paleoreef flats constructed to low-tide during the mid-Holocene highstand. In effect, the edge of dry land had not shifted seaward from the mid-Holocene paleoshoreline except where buildup of sand cays or spits above gradually shoaling paleoreef flats may have created patches of dry land. We suggest, therefore, that the Lapita age paleoshoreline is coincident and can be mapped in concordance with the mid-Holocene high- stand shoreline. The morphology for this latter shoreline is well preserved in many areas, its position marked for long reaches by a distinct slope declivity, rising 2-5 m from coastal flats within a horizontal distance of 10-25 m. The slope forms an abrupt break in local topography, with much flatter ground both above and below. This persistent occurrence of mid-Holocene paleoshoreline features encircling the lagoon at the consistent elevation expected without tectonic deformation supports an infer- ence that no detectable uplift, subsidence, or tilting of Tongatapu has occurred since last-interglacial time. Spennemann (1989; 1997) similarly has been inter- ested in the interpretation and mapping of Lapita age paleoshorelines for Fanga vUta Lagoon. Correlating this feature with the 2 m contour interval on available topo- graphic sheets, he drew his map accordingly (Spennemann 1997:Figure 2e, 13). Alternatively, our study has plotted the shoreline by tracing on the ground the slope declivity marking its trend. In practice, the position of the paleoshoreline was established within narrow lateral limits wherever the slope declivity is tran- sected by streets and roads (approximately 100 such locales), with its position between such well located intersections sketched by eye in the field. In some areas we have found that the mapped shoreline departs signifi- cantly from positions anticipated on available topo- graphic maps. These departures do not reflect tectonic deformation of the former shoreline but, rather, inaccura- cies in the placement of contour lines by photogrammet- Figure 2.

Archaeological sites from which Lapita decorated ceramics have been either excavated, or found on the surface, are also plotted on Figure 3. As these maps illustrate clearly, in mid-Holocene time, extending at least until the initial Lapita colonisation, the paleogeography of Fanga vUta Lagoon was qualitatively different. At present the Nuku'alofa peninusula and the almost contiguous island of Nukunukumotu form a nearly continuous barrier across the mouths of both arms of Fanga 'Uta Lagoon (Figure 2a). An additional screen of small reef islets further separates the modern Fanga 'Uta environment from open sea to the north. In Lapita time (Figure 2b, 3), multiple passes between paleoislands then occupying the area of the present-day Nuku'alofa peninsula gave much more direct and extensive tidal access for ocean water into twin but separate Fanga 'Uta embayments (eastern and western). Both embayments were deeper and less landlocked than the two derivative arms of the present-day Fanga 'Uta Lagoon. 91 A 4 p oo ^ ou offshore island ° screen Fanga 'Uta Lagoon ] / / / (West Arm) ^^'^^ J [J / ' I Folaha J / Fanga 'Uta Lagoon *'(~')^$ ι 2 3 yCuSi /'rmj ι ' " τ" * ι KM Β ' ^s' offshore island ^.f ' / S screen ¡I West Fanga /^aS^ /ß' 'Uta Bay v/ *··%, &lt;£/ / ( &lt;ξ&gt; ν) j - -&gt; Folaha / y East Fanga Jà** f^'J •Uta Bay ^-^J'/</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3. Lapita-age paleoshoreline detail with distribution plot of sites having decorated Lapita ceramics. Site numbers are keyed to Table 1. The trend of the principal island shoreline in Lapita time (Figure 2b) followed an arcuate course, slightly con- cave to the north, extending from west of Nuku'alofa, along a southern path to the south of the present-day Nuku'alofa peninsula. This segment of the paleoshoreline lay directly along the northern edge of the Folaha penin- sula between the two ancestral Fanga 'Uta embayments, and extended eastward beyond the mouth of the eastern embayment past a prominent spit built at Nukuleka by longshore drift of beach sand. The sand was transported toward the southwest under the influence of the prevail- ing tradewinds from the coastline adjacent to more ele- vated tracts of northeastern Tongatapu. The heads of both the eastern and western Fanga 'Uta embayments lay no more than 5 km inland from comparatively open water north of the paleoshoreline trend. The present city of Nuku'alofa was occupied in part by two small paleoislands, nucleated around remnant Vaini patch reefs (Figure 3) that still form prominent hills on the urban landscape. The continuous barrier of the present-day Nuku'alofa peninsula did not yet exist. In Lapita time, sea water could therefore pass, from the open sea to the north, directly across the site of modern Nuku'alofa into the western Fanga 'Uta embayment. Access from the eastern Fanga 'Uta embayment to the open sea was also closer and easier than today, across a baymouth approximately 2 km wide between the Folaha peninsula and Nukuleka. High ground near the north- western tip of the Folaha peninsula, which separates the eastern and western arms of the present-day Fanga 'Uta Lagoon, was almost a separate island, linked to the main part of the peninsula to the southeast only by a low Lapita-age swale rising but slightly above the mid- Holocene intertidal zone. Lapita Settlements on the Fanga ^Uta Shore Systematic and intensive archaeological survey of the Fanga vUta Lagoon paleoshoreline has not been undertaken despite the varied projects carried out on Tongatapu. Based on a cumulative record from earlier studies (Spennemann 1986, Poulsen 1987) as well as incidental discovery during our mapping project, 14 sites with decorated Lapita ceram- ics can be plotted on the paleoshoreline map (Figure 3, Table 1).

Fanga NUta Lagoon sites where decorated Lapita pottery sherds have been excavated or collected from the sur- face. Site sizes are gross approximations and generally not based on extensive testing. Site numbers (To 1-6) are those assigned by Poulsen (1987). regular intervals along the shore, especially in the area of the Folaha Peninsula, would add significantly to this num- ber. Because so little is known about most of the sites, it is difficult to characterize them as to type, or use them to define an early Lapita settlement pattern. What can be said is that their widespread distribution around the former embayments and on offshore islands suggests a rapid and extensive occupation of the central leeward coast of Tongatapu. It also is interesting to note that this settlement did not immediately extend to Tongatapu as a whole. Archaeological surveys on the windward coast as well on the eastern and western ends of the island have failed to find unequivocal sites with early decorated Lapita ceramics (Spennemann 1986, 1989). Plainware period sites are widely distributed illustrating large scale population increases, and settlement pattern change, in the post Lapita period (see Burley 1998a:362-363). Excavated sites on or near Fanga vUta Lagoon are dominated by shell midden deposits, some including extremely compacted concentrations of shell. These mid- dens consist predominantly of the bivalves Anadara and Gafrarium (Groube 1971, Poulsen 1987, Spennemann 1987). The intensive collection of these species, it is assumed, served as a principal if not dominant incentive for Lapita age settlement aggregation around the Fanga vUta shore. Anadara are of further note as their habitat generally requires the sandy or muddy bottom of an inter- tidal reef flat with a high degree of sea water intake. This is a markedly different environment than occurs in the lagoon at present. A decline in post-Lapita sea levels and consequential siltation, as Spennemann (1987) has argued, eventually led to the extirpation of this species within a radically changing Fanga NUta Lagoon ecology. The location of several of the plotted Lapita sites is confusing with exclusive reference to modern landforms. For example, three of the northwestern sites, including Mangaia mound first tested by McKern, are fully land- locked within the present-day Nukualofa urban complex. In Lapita times these were situated on the coast of an off- shore paleoisland that partially screened the western Fanga NUta embayment from the open sea. Similarly, Poulsen's sites of To 1 and To 3/4 are difficult to interpret today, occurring within a very lowlying modern village complex at the southwestern corner of the lagoon at ele- vations only 1.2-1.5 m above the present water level. Formerly both were situated along the subdued crest of a low rise that is now interpreted as the remnant of a paleo- island that formed as a slightly emergent sand cay. This cay stood well into the mid-Holocene embayment from well defined paleoshoreline declivities to the west and south. Examination of the sediment beneath the cay indi- cates deposition within a shallow tidal lagoon (Crook 1987), implying its formation took place by tidal currents within the shoaling bayhead environment. The relation- ship of other sites to the lagoon shore are more easily understood, as they occur on top of or immediately to the front of the mid-Holocene declivity described previously. At least a few, as is the case for Poulsen's Havateiho site to be examined later, are well back from the current beach and separated from it by a dense thicket of mangrove. 93</page><page sequence="6">Figure 4. Nukuleka site (To 2) , Tongatapu. Refer to Figure 3 for site location. Nukuleka (To 2) as the Founding Settlement? The village of Nukuleka is situated on the northwestern coast of a peninsula of land with passage to both the open ocean and Fanga vUta Lagoon (Figure 3). This peninsula formed as a sandy spit built part way across the mouth of the eastern of the twin Lapita-age Fanga vUta embay ments as sea level began to recede from the mid-Holocene highstand. Poulsen's (1987:23) survey of the peninsula recorded "several midden sites" and quan- tities of potsherds all over the area. He selected one of these, a mound in the southwestern corner of the village, to excavate. His objectives, as stated (ibid.:9), were to investigate aspects of mound construction and use and, in light of the site's access to lagoon and ocean fisheries, to recover items of prehistoric fishing gear. A 1 χ 15 m long trench was excavated from the centre of the mound to its perimeter with a smaller trench nearby. It was real- ized immediately that the mound had been built as a late prehistoric burial tumulus, and that mound fill, from which a majority of the pottery and other artifacts were recovered, was a secondary deposit scraped from the sur- rounding area or transported to the site. It also was con- cluded that the remaining limits of in situ occupation exclusively lay sealed beneath the mound in a "midden" deposit ranging between 0.8 and 1 m in thickness. Poulsen recovered a relatively large collection of ceramics from his excavation of the mound fill and mid- den. The greatest majority of these are very small frag- ments with varying degrees of degradation indicative of extreme site disturbance. Two hundred and forty-five nonceramic artifacts also were excavated, the dominant category (n = 69) being Anadara shell "net sinkers". Despite defining three stratigraphie horizons for the mound, all materials were attributed to the earliest period of Tongan prehistory (Poulsen 1987:25). This collection continues to be treated as a temporally homogeneous assemblage for interpretation and comparison (Best 1984, Dye 1996, Spennemann and Head 1997). Initial radiocarbon dating of the site proved problematic (Poulsen 1987:26-27) but Groube's (1971:303) later submission of a collection of Poulsen's Anadara net sinkers returned a measurement of 3090 ± 95 B.P (ANU 541) for the lower submound occupation. Spennemann and Head (1997:1053), using a lagoon specific reservoir correction, recalculate this date to 2820 ± 90 cal BR Our investigations at Nukuleka were to accomplish a number of different tasks, the three most important being 1) to recover in situ charcoal for additional radiocarbon dating, 2) to systematically and intensively recover a rep- resentative sample of faunal remains for comparison to Havapai faunas and 3) to assess the spatial boundaries of the site, its stratigraphy, and its relationship to other pot- tery scatters on the peninsula. A limited series of auger tests, as well as six 1 χ 1 m units, including one in the burial mound, were excavated (Figure 4). The results of this work illustrate a more extensive and complex site than Poulsen describes. Faunal remains other than shell- fish, and charcoal samples with good context, were rare. The Nukuleka site has changed little from the time of Poulsen's work (Figure 4).1 The burial mound has a diameter of between 35 and 40 m and a maximum height of approximately 0.65 to 0.7 m above the surrounding terrain. The elevation of the ground surface adjacent to the mound is no more than 50 cm above the maximum high tide storm ridge on the beach, and circa 1 to 1.2 m above MSL. At water's edge during Lapita times, the site now is located 80 m southeast of the beach in the south- west corner of Nukuleka village. Decorated and plain ceramic sherds, nonceramic artifacts, firebroken rock, and midden debris are abundantly present in gardens adjacent to the burial mound. These indicate an approxi- mate site boundary of 100 m north/south by 75 m east/west. The Nukuleka Peninsula additionally includes a varied patchwork of other Lapita ceramic scatters. One concentration has eroded on to the beach 125 m to the northwest, another was previously documented by Spennemann (1986:42) in a school yard almost an equal 1. Poulsen did not prepare a general site map to relocate the mound or his excavations. Residents of this part of Nukuleka did recall his project and they were able to roughly position the location of his trench on the mound. Spennemann (1986: 42) reported that the mound had been destroyed by the construction of a school in the early 1980s. This is clearly not the case. 94 ' y/XUnTt 1 ' Φ^Ζ&amp; Scattered + +Garde+n + &amp; *&gt; J* *%,$ ''*.

Radiocarbon dates from the midden stratum below the Nukuleka site burial mound. distance to the east, and still others are reported by Poulsen (1987:23), including abundant sherds on the "sand flats at low tide". Excavation units were positioned to assess the depth, integrity and chronological associations of cultural mate- rial in different areas of the site (see Figure 4). Units to the south (Nos. 3 &amp; 4) and southeast (Nos. 5 &amp; 6) of the mound generally incorporate a cultural matrix of between 50 and 60 cm depth. The lower stratum, includ- ing decorated Lapita sherds, was originally positioned on a base of yellow coral sand with some reef detritus pre- sent. The excavation unit (No. 1) in the garden to the northwest was significantly different. Here decorated Lapita and other sherds were recovered from an 85 cm thick mixed deposit of reworked beach materials, includ- ing branch coral fragments and other types of reef litter. It is believed that this portion of the site fell within an active intertidal zone at the time of first Lapita settle- ment, if not for some time after. Finally, the excavation unit (No. 2) within the burial mound duplicated Poulsen 's results in having two principal cultural strata, the "Mound" and "Midden" horizons. A single AMS radiocarbon date based on charcoal from the "Midden" zone gave an age of 2790 ± 50 BP (CAMS 59624). When calibrated, this provides a virtually identical date to the one corrected by Spennemann and Head for the same stratum (Table 2). An assemblage of 4087 ceramic sherds as well as a limited number of other artifacts and faunal remains were excavated from the scattered units (Tables 3 and 4). The vast majority of the ceramics continue to be very small fragments, with the greatest degrees of fragmenta- tion occurring in the burial mound unit. Here 81.2 % of the recovered sherds were less than 3 cm in diameter. The assemblage is informative notwithstanding. There is, for example, an extremely high proportion of decorated Lapita sherds in comparison to other sites in Tonga, whether one compares overall sherd counts (13% deco- rated) or rims (43% decorated). Combined with radiocar- bon dates, this identifies an early Lapita site occupation, and one quite probably limited in its temporal duration. More important than the abundance of decorated sherds at Nukuleka is the observation that several ceramic motifs are close to or indistinguishable with motifs from the western Lapita province (Figure 5). In this respect the assemblage stands alone among Tongan Lapita sites. Several of the western style motifs also occur on "white paste" sherds that were recovered by Poulsen (1987:135) and ourselves. Although temper sands for these sherds was originally thought to be of local origin (Dickinson 1987), pétrographie re-analysis (Dickinson 1999) indicates they are not. The source of the temper has yet to be determined. The archaeological data for the Lapita settlement at Nukuleka are on the one hand intriguing and on the other frustratingly disturbed. Located at the entrance of a large open embayment, the site is well positioned to exploit the inner reef system with easy access to open navigable water. Radiocarbon dates and ceramic evidence suggest it was one of the earliest settlements in the archipelago and pétrographie analysis of tempers from the "white paste" sherds imply that we are dealing with one of the first, if not the first, voyaging canoes to Tonga. Implications notwithstanding, the data continue to be mixed, highly fragmentary, and difficult to interpret with any degree of certainty. The site also is without a signifi- cant faunal component, and in situ charcoal samples for radiocarbon dating are rare. Shellfish harvesting at HaKateiho (To 5) The site at Havateiho is situated approximately 100 m southwest of the present lagoon shore on gently rising terrain. As Poulsen (1987:31) states, it fronts a consider- ably steeper slope, this being the mid-Holocene beach strand as plotted on our map.

This table does not include surface collected specimens nor artifacts with uncertain provenience as identified by Poulsen (1987). of early ceramic bearing midden. In addition to the mid- den, Poulsen notes that the Havateiho site and adjacent area had several monumental features, including a coni- cal water well, a large chiefly burial mound and several smaller mounds. These features represent a site use two millennia or more removed from the midden but, as to be illustrated, they have important consequences for the preservation of earlier components. Poulsen selected the densest area of shell remains for his initial excavation of a 1 χ 11 m trench with additional units excavated to the east (see Figure 6). The stratigraphy was similar across the area with an upper stratum of "top- soil" and "sticky brownish clay" approximately 50 cm thick, underlain by a 20 cm thick "heterogeneous mixture of dark grey earth" having numerous shells, and a lower cultural deposit of from 20 to 60 cm thickness of "very compact shells" intermixed with coral sand (Poulsen 1987:33). Using this stratigraphy, three horizons were defined, the lower two being equated with early and mid- dle Lapita periods. An excavated collection of 321 deco- rated sherds provided a range of motifs similar to other Lapita sites Poulsen had excavated. Radiocarbon dates from two occupation features in the midden, unfortu- nately, proved to be much later in time, and "not relevant to any part of the ceramic sequence" (ibid.:37). On examination of the Havateiho ceramic assemblage at the Australian National University, it was apparent that the site context was different from the others excavated by Poulsen. Rather than the small and heavily degraded sherds so massively present at Nukuleka, the Havateiho assemblage was well preserved. No reconstructable ves- sels were present, but several very large pieces (Figure 5) held promise that additional excavations might recover such material. Similar to Nukuleka, field objectives for Havateiho were to 1) recover additional radiocarbon sam- ples to establish a site chronology, 2) assess site stratigra- phy in light of earlier defined cultural horizons, and 3) recover a representative sample of faunal remains. The latter was considered of particular importance given our failure to attain this goal at Nukuleka. 96</page><page sequence="9">Figure 5.

Refer to Figure 3 for site location. In 1999 the Havateiho site area was overgrown with high grass and scrub vegetation making surface visibility impossible. Preliminary auger tests were able to locate the compacted shell midden layer that Poulsen encountered.2 2. As at Nukuleka, Poulsen did not prepare a site map on which his excavations were plotted. In November of 1998, a preliminary trip was made to the site with Iteni Helu, Poulsen's field foreman. Iteni confirmed the general area of the excavation on the lower slope, but was unable to be more specific. Quite fortuitously our first attempt at a controlled test excavation unit fell within Poulsen's eastern excavation block. Using this as an orientation, it was possible to locate the remainder of his excavations on the ground. A series of excavation units were then positioned to re- examine Poulsen's excavated areas as well as extend investigations further inland (Figure 6). A total of 12.25 m2 was completed. In extent, the site now is estimated to be 75 m east/west by 50 m north/south. Shell midden deposits occur continuously along the base and side slope of the mid-Holocene shoreline beyond these boundaries, 98 '^^ Mangrove '' ' ^^^^-^&lt;Λ^^-ν_^^ '' ' Lagoon ^7 Burial Mound Λ^" ( w ^ ^sN. ¿&gt; &gt;v ^ ' / Mangrove ^"^ , ff/ Ϊ Xix^ ^ &lt;//// , · V*O Trees ^ 'V F Γ_ Chiefly **' A ■ 1 999 Excavation F_ well Jj D 1964 Excavation V Λ AT κ* "^ ι metres Χ/ "Tj I 0 5 10 15 /'/'/'/'/φι'ΙΊ'Γ/'ΠΊΤΠ' I ' Steep slope ,,, I ' Steep slope | Ρ 1 ' »</page><page sequence="11">Lab Number Date Cal BP 13e Comments CAMS 59620 2680 ± 50 2740 ± 90 -25.7 This sample was collected from Unit 4, Stratum II from a depth of 73 cm below surface.

While the sample age falls within the early part of the Polynesian plainware period elsewhere in Tonga, it also can be accepted as termi- nal Lapita or transitional. A large earth oven does occur in this unit and charcoal also may have become transposed from an upper stratum.

CAMS 59623 2730 ± 50 2800 ± 40 -27.2 This sample was collected from Unit 1 at a depth of 90 cm below surface. It is associated with a compacted Lapita midden deposit of Gafrarium and Anadara shell. Table 5. Radiocarbon dates from Havateiho (To 5). All dates are based on charcoal. Calibrations were done using Calibeth 1.5b for the Macintosh using the high precision decadal curve of Stuiver and Becker (1993). All dates were reduced by 40 years prior to calibration to account for southern hemispheric correction. but the presence of a decorated Lapita ceramic component was not confirmed. Excavation units in the lower (northern) portion of the site again replicated Poulsen's stratigraphie account. The upper 50 cm of loam, described as a "sticky brownish clay" provides a protective cap to the lower midden. The origins of this matrix are from slopewash, its ultimate source being excavated sediments from the adjacent (ups- lope) late prehistoric conical water well (see Figure 6). The later occupation of the site thus contributed to its preservation, resulting in the assemblage of larger sherds previously noted. The midden deposits below the slope- wash cap are a densely compacted assemblage of Anadara and Gafrarium bivalve shells with limited cultural materi- als and other fauna. As Poulsen described, two strata can be defined within this midden, but the upper differs from the lower only in it being mixed with slopewashed loam. The entire midden is the result of an intensive shellfish harvest that, based on an in situ radiocarbon date of 2730 ± 50 BP (CAMS 5962, Table 5) took place fully within the earlier Lapita period. The presence of two cultural horizons related to early and middle Lapita ceramic peri- ods in this portion of the site is questionable. The densely packed shell fish remains are informative for they represent one of the dominant reasons for the site being occupied originally. In the area of the northern exca- vation units, these had been shucked and piled directly on an exposed reef flat. Poulsen's (1987:Figure 19) strati- graphic profile for his main trench illustrates the presence of both beach and reef flat with the accumulation of shell over top. Occurring in our excavation units as well, this interface allows us to estimate the position of the shoreline on first occupation (Figure 6). It also is conspicuous that the lowermost shell has but limited degradation from immersion in the reef. The shell fish dump was built quickly, and it created a new land surface above high tide. Recognizing the specialized nature of the midden on the forebeach and reef, additional test units were excavated inland in what originally would have been a back beach setting (Figure 6). This is the typical location for habitation in Lapita sites of Havapai (Burley 1998a, 1999), and it proved to be the case at Havateiho as well. In fact the small block excavation in this area not only encountered an early Lapita occupation zone but a sequent Polynesian Plainware component superimposed over top. A radiocarbon date of 2670 ± 40 BP (CAMS 59622) was acquired from the bot- tom of the Lapita stratum in direct association with the bones of extinct birds (Table 5). This is slightly later than the date for the lower midden but overlaps with it at one sigma standard error. A large number of occupation fea- 99</page><page sequence="12">Excavation Decor. Decor.

Nonceramic artifacts excavated from Havateiho (To 5). This table does not include surface collected specimens nor artifacts with uncertain provenience as identified by Poulsen (1987). tures dominated by earth ovens and post holes were present in both components. As a consequence of this disturbance, two additional radiocarbon dates (CAMS 59620 and CAMS 59621) from a single excavation unit appear reversed in their stratigraphie order. The ceramic assemblage recovered from the 1999 excavations at Havateiho include 11,153 pieces of which only 297 are decorated (Table 6). Decorated wares are present in both the northern midden and southern occu- pation zones with the greatest number of undecorated rims excavated from the Plainware component of the lat- ter. Decorated vessel forms and motifs are typical of other Lapita sites in Tonga with similar age (Figure 5). The nonceramic collection includes a range of well pre- served specimens from shell valuables such as bracelets, rings and beads, to bird bone needles, to abrading tools of various forms, to adzes and other lithic items (Table 7). Most were recovered from the block excavation in the southern occupation area. This variability is in marked contrast to the assemblage recovered from the northern midden where Anadara net weights dominate Poulsen 's assemblage and the one recovered in 1999. The faunal data from Havateiho have yet to be analyzed in full but two observations from the field can be made. First, and based upon systematic collection of column samples (50 χ 50 cm) from the northern and southern excavation units, it is apparent that a transition took place in shell fish exploitation strategies during the Plainware phase. Anadara and Gafrarium continue to be present in large numbers in Plainware strata, but a far more diversi- fied assemblage representing a broad range of habitats occurs in this later period. Second, Lapita associated fau- nal collections incorporate a relative abundance of extinct birds, a large bodied iguana as well as sea turtle; these are far less abundant or absent in the upper strata. We con- clude that the Lapita peoples at Havateiho were heavily exploiting the natural resource base as a component of their subsistence economy. The intensity with which this was undertaken had an immediate and deleterious impact on the surrounding environment. Derivative statements on the Lapita period of Tonga Tongan Lapita sites have been consequential for early gen- eral definitions of the archaeological culture, especially as 100</page><page sequence="13">their location on the southeastern periphery of the Lapita frontier gives them relevance to broadly based questions about the migration itself. The timing of first settlement and the duration of the decorated ceramic period, the defi- nition and relationships of Lapita artifact assemblages to those from the west, and the processes by which first set- tlement was accomplished are important considerations for Tongan Lapita studies. Our recent excavations in Havapai and on Tongatapu provide a large collection of ceramic, faunal, and other materials that bear upon such questions. With a proviso that analyses are on-going, we provide initial thoughts on the implications of these data. Tongan Lapita Chronology Prior to 1990, the radiocarbon chronology for Tonga, infact western Polynesia as a whole, was fraught with much uncertainty (Spriggs 1990, 1996). A large number of shell dates, doubts over the validity of Gakashuin Laboratory measurements, poor context, large standard deviations for charcoal dates, and other problems, led to claims for Lapita origins in Tonga as early as 3300-3400 cal BP (Kirch 1988), with even the most conservative estimate no later than 2950-3000 cal BP (Spriggs 1996). These claims, in part, resulted in Jared Diamond's (1988 also see Diamond 2000) observations of a Lapita express train across Oceania - Austronesian peoples having arrived in the east simultaneously or very shortly after their earliest documentation in the west. Resulting from the above, a principal concern for both Ha'apai and Tongatapu research projects has been the construction of a reliable radiocarbon chronology - one based on multiple charcoal dates from secure contexts employing accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). From Havapai there now exist 31 AMS radiocarbon measure- ments from six sites with Lapita and/or sequent Polynesian plainware components (Burley et al. 1999). These provide a consistent and coherent temporal frame- work with initial Havapai settlement no earlier than 2850 cal BP (900 BC) and the Polynesian Plainware phase beginning at circa 2650 cal BP (700 BC). When pro- posed, this chronology was argued to have relevance for the entire archipelago based on a comparative review of then existing Lapita/Plainware dates, including those for Tongatapu (as recalibrated by Spennemann 1989:107). The radiocarbon dates presented here for Tongatapu continue to support the proposed temporal framework, albeit with slight modification. The earliest age of occupa- tion at Havateiho, and the estimated transition to Plainware, fall well within the dates for most of the Havapai sites (see Burley et al 1999:68-69). These occupations are fully contemporaneous, and the loss of decorated Lapita pottery in Havapai seems matched on Tongatapu at almost the same period of time. Dating of Nukuleka is less secure in the absence of multiple charcoal measurements with good associations. This notwithstanding, the single AMS date from the lower stratum of the mound (2840 ± 50 cal BP) is virtually identical to the shell date (2820 ± 90 cal BP) from the same stratum as corrected by Spennemann and Head (1997:1053). This securely places the submound midden deposit at circa 2850 cal BP. Since it is possible, if not probable, that the original occupation at Nukuleka is earlier than 2850 cal BP, we revise our original estimate to 2900 cal BP for first probable appearance of Lapita in Tonga. Nukuleka is accepted as a founding community, with set- tlement progression then moving from Tongatapu to Havapai not long after. Material expressions of the Tongan Lapita Period The Lapita peoples, and their spread across the Pacific, are well marked by their distinctively decorated pottery (Kirch 1997:118-161). Excavations in Havapai have recovered over 3400 decorated sherds (Burley 1998b:49) with Poulsen's collections and those from our recent exca- vations on Tongatapu including an equally large number. In comparison to western and far western Lapita ceramic assemblages, several elements are lost to Tongan collec- tions. No longer present are highly decorated cylinder stands, stylized anthropomorphic faces, or densely applied dentate stamped motifs (for comparison see Kirch 1997, Sand 2000, Summerhayes 2000). Yet vessel form, decora- tive application, and the structural basis of the design sys- tem clearly illustrate a "simplified" subset of Lapita {sensu Green 1979:54). Along with similar collections from Fiji and Samoa, they represent an Eastern Lapita ceramic style that more broadly defines the Eastern Lapita province. The Lapita ceramic assemblage from Nukuleka, as already noted, stands alone in Tonga for a number of rea- sons. No other Tongan site has as high a proportion of decorated to nondecorated sherds, whether comparisons are drawn from the overall assemblage or restricted to rim pieces. This is related to its early date and a limited duration for the occupation. More important than the proportional distributions are the several decorated sherds with western motifs (Figure 5). In light of Dickinson's (1999) recently identified foreign origin for the ceramic temper of some of these sherds, it might even be argued that portions of the Nukuleka assemblage came with an original voyaging canoe. Yet at the same time this assemblage is clearly of the Eastern Lapita style with strong relationships to all other collections in Tonga (see Poulsen 1987). We thus conclude that the distin- guishing decorative motifs of the Eastern Lapita ceramic suite were imported to Tonga, not developed in situ. The ceramic transition from Lapita to Plainware is stratigraphically and compositionally distinct in most of the excavated Tongan sites. Lapita occupations for the most part are situated on beach sands, while Plainware strata indicate a period where transported sediments, shell fish, organic remains, and dense concentrations of pottery have led to intensive and quite thick matrix buildup. The transition in pottery forms not only docu- ments a loss of decoration but the several vessel forms on which it was applied. Plainware ceramic assemblages become dominated by large well made storage jars and a 101</page><page sequence="14">small range of bowls and cups (see Dye 1996). The ques- tion of why decorated pottery was abandoned is not an easy one to answer. That it occurred over a two century period throughout the archipelago illustrates the abrupt- ness of this event. The nonceramic artifact assemblage from any given Tongan site is not large, but cumulatively a collection of over 2000 specimens is present for Havapai and Tongatapu. Tongan Lapita artifact types are indistinguish- able from those recovered from western and far western sites. The most abundant categories of formed artifacts are "shell valuables" - various types of bracelets, cir- clets, rings, beads, long units, and pendants. Most assem- blages illustrate on-site manufacture without evidence for the extensive regional exchange networks for these mate- rials postulated by Kirch (1997:236-238). Within the remainder of the collection are a wide variety of produc- tion and expedient use tools from stone and shell adzes, pounders, abrading tools, scrapers/peelers, net weights as well as bird bone needles and awls. Shell fish hooks are rare but varied, including a Trochus shell trolling lure and different one piece types of turbo and pearl shell. Perhaps the most striking observation that can be made about the Tongatapu and Havapai collections is the relative dearth of flaked stone. This must be a product of raw material scarcity not technological ability, since flaked stone is abundant in the Lolokoka Lapita site on Niuatoputapu (Kirch 1988 213). There Lapita peoples had access to the nearby obsidian source on the island of Tafahi (Dye 1988b) and they exploited it intensively. Settlement process and pattern Some of the most contentious debates about the Lapita migration across the Pacific have centred on issues of subsistence economy and settlement pattern. On the one hand, and based on Tongan data, Groube (1971) pro- posed a "strand looper" model of adaptation. Lapita peo- ples are described as being dependent upon natural resources; as depletions occurred, they were forced to move to new locales or islands. On the other hand, Kirch (1997) argues that Lapita exploration and migration was carried out by well developed horticulturalists, people who brought with them a full range of plants, and a swidden-type garden system. Palynological data from Havapai does indicate a period of incipient vegetative disturbances potentially related to gardening activities of Lapita and Plainware peoples (Flenley et al. 1999). Nevertheless, the nature of the Lapita faunal record, set- tlement pattern, and other factors continue to imply an early subsistence economy heavily influenced by consid- erations other than starch production. Spennemann (1989) has used the term "optimal foragers" and we con- cur. That the Lapita people did not fully move on when depletions occurred is amply documented in the Plainware component at each of the sites. The data from Havapai and Tongatapu are remarkably consistent on natural resource use and subsistence econ- omy. As Groube found, all sites can be characterized as middens - refuse heaps in which there is abundant evi- dence for an intensive exploitation of the local environ- ment. Steadman's (1999, also Steadman et al 2000) con- tinuing analyses of recovered bird faunas, for example, has identified no less than 25 species of land and sea birds that became extinct or were locally extirpated in the first hundred years of human presence. When one adds to this the ample presence of an extinct large bodied iguana (Pregili and Dye 1989), the abundant remains of marine turtle in Lapita strata (Dye and Steadman 1990), as well as a rich and highly varied fish fauna, no other conclusion can be reached. The Lapita settlement of Tonga not only exploited local resources to their maximum capacity, but this had immediate and consequential impacts. Having given the preceding as a general observation on the process of Lapita settlement in Tonga, it also must be stated that the pattern of settlement on Tongatapu is quite different from that of the smaller islands of Havapai. From Nukuleka as a beginning point, Tongatapu settle- ment spread rapidly around the Fanga vUta shoreline to include no less than 14 villages or hamlets, and undoubt- edly many more. The density of the associated middens, as recorded at Havateiho, indicates that the populations of Anadara and Gafrarium were massive when first encoun- tered, and that these shell fish were a critical variable for Tongatapu settlement distribution. When one places this resource within a context of large embayments with white sand beaches, off-shore protective islands, and an abun- dance of other potential natural foods, Tongatapu must truly have appeared as a sacred place. The settlement of Havapai took place contemporane- ously with the expansion of settlement on Tongatapu, as indicated by radiocarbon dates. The islands of Havapai are small, and the natural resource base, while continu- ing to be rich, is significantly reduced in scale. As a response to island size, Lapita settlements were restricted to a single hamlet on individual islands, with no more than a small number of households per locale. No site in Havapai is estimated to exceed 2000 m2, and most are less than 1000 m2 (Burley 1998b:49). These sites are consistently located in back beach settings on the pro- tected leeward coast of the island facing lagoons or reef flats where canoes can be easily beached. Typically they also are characterized as middens with abundant evi- dence for exploitation and impact on the local environ- ment. The settlement strategy in Havapai is concordant with a mobile, maritime adaptation. Here, no doubt, inter-island voyaging for social, economic and possibly political considerations would have been crucial. Conclusions In writing this paper our objectives have been two-fold. The first of these has been to present an overview of recently conducted research on the Lapita occupation of Fanga vUta Lagoon on Tongatapu. This includes not only a reassessment of the Nukuleka and Havateiho sites first 102</page><page sequence="15">excavated by Jens Poulsen in the early 1960s, but the results of a paleoshoreline study of the lagoon itself. Without the latter, interpretation of the former is difficult if not impossible. The second objective has been to dis- cuss the implications of these data for earlier research conclusions founded on survey and excavations in the central Tongan islands of Havapai (Burley 1998b, 1999; Burley et al. 1999). This leads us to suggest that the site of Nukuleka on Tongatapu is one of if not the earliest Lapita settlement in the archipelago based on radiocar- bon dates and its ceramic assemblage. Accordingly 2900 cal BP is proposed for first settlement of Tongatapu with a slightly later movement northward to Havapai. This paper also has illustrated quite varied Lapita settlement patterns for Tongatapu and Havapai. Encountering a large protected embayment and abundant populations of the bivalves Anadara and Gafrarium on Tongatapu, Lapita peoples spread outward to eventually establish a continu- ous distribution of sites around the Fanga vUta shoreline. The reduced size and carrying capacity of the Havapai islands, however, resulted in but single settlements on each of the principal islands. The short term conse- quences of human settlement were the same for both areas, numerous extinction events and probable deple- tions in even the most abundant resources. Having presented new data on some of the older prob- lems of the Lapita period in Tonga, the intention here is not to argue that all issues have been resolved, nor even those specifically addressed in the paper. Analysis is on- going and detailed comparisons of artifact and faunal assemblages from different sites could well discover pat- terning not obvious at present. Additional fieldwork on Fanga vUta Lagoon is needed to survey and gather even the most basic of site data for the numerous Lapita settle- ments around its shores. And equally important, it is impossible to refer to the Lapita period of Tonga as a whole without data from the northern islands of Vavavu. Only limited evidence for a Lapita presence (Davidson 1971) has been found in Vavavu, and excavations have yet to be carried out on either Lapita or Plainware com- ponents. Many of these islands are dominated by sea cliff shorelines, and this landscape would have posed a still different challenge for Lapita adaptation. To wit, much has been learned since McKern's (1929) first illustration of Tongan pottery, but so much more remains to be done if the full Lapita story is to be told.
