WILSON N Richard Hakluyt's version of Espejo's Relaci6n there are three allusions to the idols of the Pueblo Indians. In this province our men found many idols which they worshipped, and particularly they had in every house an oratory for the diuell, whereinto they ordinarily carry him meat. . .. Which Indians have and doe worship idols .. .2 Of the Queres, he writes: Who worship idols as their neighbors do, and in conclusion he says: We may boldly presume that they will easily embrace the Gospel and abandon such idolatrie as now most of them doe live in.8 It is interesting to compare with the Hakluyt version, the exact translation from the Narrative of Espejo given to us by Professor Bolton: In each one of these pueblos, they have a house to which they carry food for the devil, and they have small stone idols which they worship. Just as the Spanish have crosses along the roads, they have between the pueblos in the middle of the road, small caves or grottoes, like shrines, built of stones, where they place painted sticks and feathers, saying the devil goes there to rest and speak with them.4 Of the Maguas: and like the rest, have idols which they worship.5 Of the Queres: They are idolators.s 1 Voyages of the English Nation to America, Collected by Richard Hakluyt, Preacher, vol.

Moreover, Ofiate in Discovery of the Salines and the Sea writes: In all of these pueblos we found crosses which the Indians reverence and to which they are accustomed to make the same offerings as to their idols. .. .. And yet comparatively few such figures have been found. Ex-Governor L. Bradford Prince has the largest single ,collection of stone idols; there ate some in the Archeological Museum at Santa Fe and in other museums. Too often the pedigree of these figures is unknown or obscure. Nelson, however, reports the excavation of two room-idols of stone, one in Pueblo Blanco and the other in Pueblo Largo. He found, also, a shrine-idol on a hillock about six hundred feet from Pueblo Largo.3 The small clay figure (pl. xxIv) excavated August, 1916, from one of the rooms of the large pueblo at Otowi4 is unique, so far as I know. It is cylindrical, five and a half inches high, and one and three quarters inches in diameter. It is black with soot, yet everywhere underneath this black covering may be seen the light red coloring which was superimposed upon the gray clay. As the profile view shows quite clearly, the arms, neck, face, and features were produced first by incision and then by rubbing away contiguous areas. Turquoise is inset in the middle of each of the eyes, and in the chest. The latter ornamentation corresponds in position to the mark on the stone idol described by Nelson.s Does it represent perhaps the heart? The figure was found in the circular hole apparently made for it in the north wall of the room, ten inches above the floor, and one foot and eight inches from the northeast corner (pl. xxv). The room itself measured nine feet nine inches, six feet seven inches (the great- 1 Op. cit., p. 182. 2 Op. cit., p. 235. a Pueblo Ruins of the Galisteo Basin, N. C.

The height signifies little. Undoubtedly the rooms in this pueblo were originally about six feet high, for they decrease in height quite regularly toward the plazas. This room is the fourth from the great central plaza, and the third from a smaller plaza between it and another arm of the same building. The west wall of the same room had an opening (closed with stone) into the next room, eight inches long and a foot in height, and on its southern wall two doors, one two feet nine inches by one foot five inches, and the other one foot nine inches by one foot four inches ANY i;j~i w, ft-r:: :j--:4jtwo FIG. 76.-Room in which the image was found, showing the southern doorways and the western opening described in the text.

Whether this figure was an idol or a "diuell," I am naturally unable to state, but its composition, ornamentation, and the situa- tion in which it was found make it intrinsically interesting.
