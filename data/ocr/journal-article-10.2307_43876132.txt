From a ruptured Blood vessel Comes a prayer - Robert Smithson, "From the City/' unpublished poem, ca. I9601 A degraded paradise is perhaps worse than a degraded hell. America abounds in banal heavens, in vapid "happy-hunting grounds/' and in "natu- ral" hells like Death Valley. ..or The Devil's Playground.... The abysmal problem of gardens somehow involves a fall from somewhere or something. The certainty of the absolute garden will never be regained. - Robert Smithson, footnote to "A Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects," 1968 [RS 113] Sifting through Smithson, one navigates stratigraphie lay- ers. Not the least of which are the data files accumulating over the years: his essays, the unpublished/now published poetry, the reviews of other artists' works, the interviews. Then, there are the chunkier layers: the collages, the crum- pled sheets documenting unrealized projects, the slide- shows in their battered cardboard mounts, the stashes of Instamatic prints, the brittle photostats. The built earth- works are just part of the palimpsest: crusting up again out of the Great Salt Lake, or dropping back under the flow; looming over the sand quarry at Sonsbeek or plowed under by the administrators at Kent State. Although privileged by art history, their stratigraphy is just part of the story; they are crumbling, gone, or stubbornly resistant to the miner's pick. The Smithson lode, like breccia, is an aggregate of the organic and the inorganic, compounded materials dragged from different times and places, annealed under intense pressure. But, in his own words, no materials are solid, they all contain caverns and fissures.... Words and rocks contain a language that follows a syntax of splits and ruptures. Look at any word long enough and you will see it open up into a series of faults, into a terrain of particles each containing its own void.2 [RS 107] The fissures are crucial to our project of finding the spiritu- al Smithson. That author-function will never be found "intact," but always in the interstices of the aggregate, threaded by gnosis and larded with doubt. The archaeological and geological practices engaging the Smithson reader/viewer are entirely appropriate, replicating the activities of an artist/theorist for whom text was mate- rial to be heaped, piled, accumulated, and pushed around. "Earthwords," Smithson called Edgar Allan Poe's prescient evocation of earthworks in The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket 1 850: Nothing worth mentioning occurred during the next twenty-four hours, except that, in examining the ground to the eastward third chasm, we found two triangular holes of great depth, and also with black granite sides.3 [RS 108] Words were as material as earth, and dirt as fluidly con- structed as discourse. Regardless of what they signified for Poe, triangular holes were one of the options for artists Walter De Maria, Michael Heizer, Robert Morris, and others whose work Smithson illustrated and discussed. But Smithson declined this ancient iconic form and the cubic JONES/ 25</page><page sequence="3">obsessions of Minimalism (the cube a vestige of late-mod- ernism). For Smithson, it was the spiral, the labyrinth, and the vortex that figured his desire. ...unlike those monuments of the past which evolved out of the matrix of beliefs and religions of their time, the Spiral Jetty came into existence as the individual vision of a single artist.4 Such market-driven fantasies of authorial integrity are posthumous, imposed on a more complex author-function emerging specifically as "Smithson" from the permeation of individual intention by dispersed, communal, or aggregative authorial functions. Larger social units fueled and produced the mature work we nominate as "Smithsons:" road trips, filmmaking, sample collecting, "jobbing out," delegated photography, and even virtuosic bulldozer crews and aerial surveys. Smithson was a culminating author, but only in the Benjaminian sense of an author-as-producer, in this case, a productive theorist of experience: In June 1968, my wife Nancy, Virginia Dwan, Dan Graham, and I visited the slate quarries in Bangor-Ben Argyl, Pennsylvania. Banks of sus- pended slate hung over a greenish-blue pond at the bottom of a deep quarry. All boundaries and distinctions lost their meaning in this ocean of slate and collapsed all notions of gestalt unity. The present fell forward and backward into a tumult of "de-differentiation," to use Anton Ehrenzweig's word for entropy.... How can one contain this "oceanic" site?... The container is in a sense a fragment itself, something that could be called a three-dimensional map. Without appeal to "gestalts" or "anti-form," it actually exists as a fragment of a greater fragmentation. It is a three- dimensional perspective that has broken away from the whole, while containing the lack of its own containment. [RS 110-111] Here, Smithson's spiral moved out, away from the ompha- los of the sacrosanct studio, away from the city-system, and, referentially, away from the gallery's white cube. The Non-sites, in the gallery, and their dialectic with the Site, at an absent, industrially disrupted periphery, held the art world system tenuously in place, but only as a relay for experience and concept, part of the "back-and-forth" that interested Smithson. The site is a place where a piece should be but isn't. [RS 250] As the idea for the Sprial Jetty took form, the art world sys- tem became a discursive construct: "I'm not really discon- tent. I'm just interested in exploring the apparatus I'm being threaded through."5 The spiral was the figure for that threading: the spiraling of celluloid through the projector, the spiraling of salt crystals in their molecular lattice, the oral and aural "spiral ear" referenced in Brancusi's sketch of James Joyce. In my argument, the spirals began sensationally for Smithson as stigmata- wormholes between Enlightenment rationality and the ancient symbolism of blood and passion, violently shuttling the Catholic boy from his New Jersey pew to the "Gothic" sensibilities of a million backyards. He drew spirals on the feet of Christ, latticed like a spider's web. These early drawings, exhibited in Smithson's first one-man show in Rome, showed the spiral tunneling inward, downward, into the body of the Christ, down to the bedrock of crucifixion, uncertain and endlessly incompre- hensible. Art was never objectified during the Ages of Faith; art was an "act" of worship. Icons would never be "looked" at like a tourist looks at an objet ďart... Jackson Pollock and other American "action" painters have restored something of the ritual life of art.... The rituals that Pollock discov- ered in the Hopi religion and Navajo sand-painting exist also in the outskirts of New York City. Penitential fires are built on Halloween in the dim regions of the suburbs, burning inside the rotting Jack-O'Lantern with glowing hollow eyes, nose, and mouth.6 [RS 321 and 323] As he did for so many other American artists, Pollock seemed to show the way. "A chance comparison between Georges Rouault and Pollock indicates 'inner' and 'outer' obsessions between the European and the American." [RS 321] But the path between the spiral of the stigmata and the spiral of the Jetty was itself elliptical, vortextual, and full of self-fashioning moves.7 Smithson's trip to Rome for his first one-man show in 1961 was more determinative. It turned the screw of a developing crystalline structure and initiated the tropism toward geometry that would bracket the oceanic and the spiritual (for a while): At that time I really wasn't interested in doing abstractions. I was actually interested in religion, you know, and archetypal things, I guess inter- ested in Europe.... William Burroughs' Naked 26 /JONES</page><page sequence="4">®Estate of Robert Smithson/Licensed by VAGA, New York, NY JONES/ 27</page><page sequence="5">Lunch,... Mallarmé and Gustave Moreau and that kind of thing.... It all seemed to coincide in a curi- ous kind of way. [RS 282] The "façade of Catholicism" that obsessed Smithson at the time wound itself into a picture of decadent sexuality and confronted him in Rome with its excessive display. The façade parted to reveal baroque layers of corruption, labyrinthine catacombs, and perverse desires. The spiral became a worm within the body of the church; "a snake chewing a penis" was its homoerotic symptom.8 Thus, a dialectic formed between erotica and geometry character- ized by Smithson's immediate post-Rome production, a set of exercises he described as "sort of like cartouches." Here, homoeroticism was banished to the peripheries or bracket- ed by geometric borders. In one telling cartouche, the periphery is polymorphously sexualized, the center an erot- ic vortex. Only the boundary is "pure," a crystalline set of nested hexagons. Their segments are taken in sequence to form a triangulated spiral that appears again in the first "earthwork," an aerial sculpture commissioned for the run- way bordering the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. So my trip to Rome was sort of an encounter with European history as a nightmare.... And the real breakthrough came once I was able to overcome this lurking pagan religious anthropomorphism. I was able to get into crystalline structures in terms of structures of matter and that sort of thing.... I was doing crystalline type work and my early interest in geology and earth sciences began to assert itself over the whole cultural overlay of Europe. I had gotten that out of my system. [RS 283, 284, and 286] Through the crystalline, the spiral could reassert itself. No longer scandalously homoerotic, no longer simply eschato- logical, no longer merely geometric, it knit these strata together. Like magma flowing through the interstices of a compacted situation, it crystallized as a boundary that incorporated the fragments of its own violent passage through the organic. I mean I never really could believe in any kind of redemptive situation. I was fascinated with Gnostic heresies, Manicheism, [sic] and the dual- istic heresies of the East.... I guess there was a tug of war going on between the organic and the crystalline.... Actually, I think they kind of met- a kind of dialectic occurred later on, so both areas were resolved. [RS 286 and 290] Smithson's early, unpublished poems are heart-rending - remarkably, they remained unpublished, even through the celebrity of the Spiral Jetty and its sudden precipitate, glob- al fame. "Joining with the myth of the machine," he penned around 1960, "The rebel / Expects to be damned by rust" - dust unto dust became rust unto rust as his spiral took the binary of nature/technology and pulverized it. You know, one pebble moving one foot in two million years is enough action to keep me really excited. But some of us have to simulate upheaval, step up the action. Sometimes we have to call on Bacchus. Excess. Madness. The End of the World. Mass Carnage. Falling Empires. [RS 251] Entropy became the engine of this final figuration, the archi- tect of a final spiraling path. Its slow arc looked like Nature. Was this the solution, a postmodern pastoral? Nature is an infinite sphere, whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere. [Pascal, as quoted in RS 27] The solar system's slow swan song, the "heat death" of the universe- an obsession of science in the 1960s, was only one part of the spiral. The interstitial spirituality of Smithson was equally dependent on the figure of technology- stud- ded with rust and mechanical "dinosaurs," but sutured into the very order of Nature. Technology, the artist claimed, was part of "Human Nature." Thus, part of the dialectic's resolution lay in the deep logic of the pastoral, in which the flight from the marketplace is always necessarily indexed to the market's genres and structures of value. The pastoral, in turn, was inflated by a post-Apollo techno-scientific gigantism, the sudden vision of an Earth suspended with its veil of atmosphere in an inky infinite. In bounded chaos, massive scale, and geological timeframes, Smithson found the right optic from which to view the institutionalized reli- gion that "haunted"- as he described it- his early work. The refuse between mind and matter is a mine of information. [RS 107] Mining the lode will continue to churn the strata, yielding further Smithsons from the spirals of compacted discourse. Many of those nuggets can be turned to reveal a spiritual sheen. 28 /JONES</page><page sequence="6">Notes 1 Robert Smithson, "From the City," ca. 1960, published posthumously in Robert Smithson: The Collected Writings , edited by Jack Flam (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996), 317.

The first scholar to gain access to these unpublished materials was Eugenie Tsai, who published this essay in Robert Smithson Unearthed: Drawings, Collages, Writings (New York: Columbia University Press, 1991), 61-68. 7 This trajectory is laid out more fully in Caroline Jones, Machine in the Studio: Constructing the Postwar American Artist (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), and most recently, in Caroline Jones, "Preconscious/Posthumous Smithson: The Ambiguous Status of Art and Artist in the Postmodern Frame," Res 41 (Spring 2002). 8 Smithson references the Michelangelesque figure in the posthumously pub- lished "What Really Spoils Michelangelo's Sculpture," Tsai, 1991, 73. The fig- ure is borrowed again in Smithson's cartouche drawing, Untitled (Second-Stage Injector), 1963. See the essay "Preconscious/ Posthumous Smithson," supra. The penis/snake spiral is taken from Michelangelo's skewering of his enemies in the papal curia. The figure of Minos, Prince of Hades, in the lower right corner of The Last Judgment, apparently bore an uncanny resemblance to Michelangelo's enemy Biagio da Cesena, the master of ceremonies in the papal court. Da Cesena had called the top half of the unfinished Judgment a "stufa d'ignudi" when it was shown to intimates in 1 540. Illustrations Fig. 1: Robert Smithson. A Surd View for An Afternoon, 1970.
