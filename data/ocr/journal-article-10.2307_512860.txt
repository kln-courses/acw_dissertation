Though the greater part of this volume contains studies which have been printed before over a period of almost twenty years, they are now mostly out of print, and appear here in a revised form. Like the additional essays they are the work of a critic whose brilliant analysis of individual poems and penetrating studies of the diction of poetry and the manner of its composition have provided many readers of eighteenth-century poems with fresh perceptions both of their formal beauty and their meaning and purpose. He is able to do this, I think, because he never forgets that he is concerned with the world of poetry. He gives his attention to the poetic experience-the wide knowledge of earlier poetry which Pope and Gray could draw upon-out of which the new poem is created; and he further illuminates their art and skill in choosing words and phrases and placing them in metrical forms by comparing them with the different manner and the different ways of composition of other poets, so that Keats's description of his writing of Endymion may be aptly used to reveal what Pope was doing in bringing together so much variety into the controlled unity of the Rape of the Lock. Even when, in dealing with Pope's Epistle to Harley, a poem which was called forth by a particular occasion, written for a particular person and about a parti- cular poet, he finds it necessary to offer us an introduction as well as an analysis, he is aware of exactly what he is doing, both in general remarks on the character of occasional poetry and in providing us with all that we need to know of Pope's relationships with Parnell, his edition of his poems, and the letter which accom- panied his dedication of them to Harley. This is given just to make quite clear what is the subject of the poem, so that we may realize the art which is involved in the structure of it. And here again the experience is enriched by com- parison with Dryden's poem on the death of Oldham and behind that of Virgil's lines on Marcellus. But Pope is not content merely with an elegy on the poet- their friend-whose works he is presenting to Harley; the poem moves on naturally to a justification, in the form of a panegyric, of the great statesman,</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 87 whose glory they had all shared, to whom they are now rightly offered in his eclipse: In vain to Desarts thy Retreat is made; The Muse attends thee to the silent Shade. There is the same sureness of touch in the two new studies of Gray's odes. We are reminded at once that in his first published poem, the 'Ode on the Spring', 'he stands with Milton, Coleridge, Tennyson and Mr. Eliot' among our finest metrists; and we are not allowed to overlook in the opening quatrain the verbal echoes from Shakespeare and from Virgil, and in the rest of the stanza the deliberate borrowings from Milton. We are kept in the world of poetry, we are shown the poet at work with deliberate art handling his materials of words and phrases and metrical shapes. Nevertheless, the poem is far from being a mere literary exercise; it turns into a deeply introspective autobiographical state- ment 'in which', says Mr. Ketton-Cremer, 'Gray contrived to sum up ... his loneliness, his obscurity, the desolate sense of time passing and nothing achieved which Milton had felt at twenty-three and he himself was feeling at twenty-five'. And yet here again we are shown that the expression of his feelings is shaped and coloured by his recollection of Matthew Green's 'Grotto'; though in acknowledg- ing this debt Gray said he did not know it at the time. But it was Green's 'Maggot-Youth' that gave Gray his 'Insect youth', and they are both linked to the 'poetic diction' of Thomson who talks of the 'feathered youth' in his poem on 'Spring'. And we can then go on to recognize the significance of this common diction, the anthropomorphic terminology which they applied to the rest of creation. The other ode studied here-'On the Death of a Favourite Cat'-can hardly be read today without our judgement being slightly disturbed by Johnson's familiar comment, whether we accept or react against his remark that 'it is not a happy trifle'. It is useful, therefore, to be provided with a clue to the element of parody and mock-heroic, which may be found in the diction echoing Pope's description of a great Homeric scene, transposing the heroic measure of Meantime the brightest of the Female Kind, The matchless Helen o'er the Walls reclin'd into the ballad measure of Demurest of the tabby kind, The pensive Selima reclin'd, and in the many highly-coloured epithets, 'rich', 'golden', 'azure', 'purple', which Gray borrows from Pope's lines, describing Helen's account of 'the Grecian leaders on the Plain below'. This preoccupation with words and poetic diction colours also the two studies of Johnson's Rasselas and his dictionary. The latter is treated as 'an anthology of "beauties" '-a book that can be read with enjoyment, and an indication both of the characteristic modes of expression as well as of the accepted truths of the age. The former is analysed with great skill in the attempt to disclose its carefully wrought structure, its unity as a tale with 'all its images depending on the "truth"</page><page sequence="3">88 REVIEWS for the sake of which the tale has come to be'. And thus in the terms of a good eighteenth-century definition he can conclude with the statement that all John- son's writings were poetry, in that they added delight to instruction. In these studies Professor Tillotson shows what a fine palate he has for such delights, and how they may best be savoured. HERBERT DAVIS</page></plain_text>
