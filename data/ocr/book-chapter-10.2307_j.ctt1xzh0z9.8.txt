<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> C o d a After Romantic Posthumanism In an import ant and difficult passage in “Mama’s Baby, Papa’s Maybe,”  Hortense Spillers describes an opening of freedom that paradoxically  a ppears amid the horrific confinement of the M iddle Passage: T hose African persons in “M iddle Passage”  were literally suspended in  the “oceanic,” if we think of the latter in its Freudian orientation as an  analogy for undifferentiated identity: removed from the indigenous  land and culture, and not-y et “American” e ither. . . . T hey w ere the  culturally “unmade,” thrown in the midst of a figurative darkness that  “exposed” their destinies to an unknown course. Often enough for  the captains of t hese galleys, navigational science of the day was not  sufficient to guarantee the intended destination. We might say that  the slave ship, its crew, and its human-a s-c argo stand for a wild and  unclaimed richness of possibility that is not interrupted, not “counted”   /“accounted,” or differentiated, u ntil its movement gains the land  thousands of miles away from the point of departure.1 In this brief but provocative moment, Spillers invites us to detect a “richness  of possibility” opened up by the sheer unpredictability of physical systems.  161 </page> <page sequence="2"> 162 Coda As she suggests, the uncertainty of this ship’s fate— its vulnerability to  volatile Atlantic winds and tides— lays bare the irreducibly speculative  and provisional nature of any discursive account of this ship, temporarily  suspending cultural authority and unmaking the identities that cultures  confer.  Until the ship “gains the land” and makes good on the captain’s  intentions for it, the precise nature of this venture remains undecidable:  neither American nor indigenous language speakers can claim to define  the “unknown course” they are on, nor can they say for sure if they are “cargo”  and “crew” or something else— future mutineers and shark fodder; or  every one the future- drowned. For Spillers it is not only the kidnapped  Africans, physically chained and culturally unmoored in the ship’s hold,  who are exposed to a “wild and unclaimed” unmaking; this w hole oceango- ing assemblage— “the slave ship, its crew, and its human- as- cargo”— exists  as an “undifferentiated identity” suspended in the “darkness” of an uncer- tain journey. Although Spillers is not a posthumanist, her account of oceanic suspen- sion could easily come from the pages of recent posthumanist theory. The  assemblage of ocean, ship, crew, and human- as- cargo that she conjures  highlights the distribution of power across both h uman and nonhuman  agencies in this scene. And in mapping this complex intersection of mate- rial and cultural forces (oceanic weather, colonizing and indigenous lan- guages), she insists that neither culture nor  matter is fi nally decisive; each  is vulnerable to the other. Spillers thus qualifies the linguistic determin- ism of social constructivism as well as the physical determinism of bio- logical essentialism by discovering something altogether dif fer ent in this  moment— not determinism but a complexity that produces uncertainty,  which she glosses as an unclaimed and unclaimable freedom. In a scene of  what other wise appears to be total domination, Spillers finds bright  cracks— interstices of possibility opening up in the unpredictable encoun- ter of myriad forces: the skill of the captain’s navigational science inter- secting with the power of Atlantic winds, the iron fastness of the chains  that hold h uman cargo countered by the force of that cargo’s memory of  her name. But if Spillers’s map of  human and nonhuman entanglement in this mo- ment is reminiscent of posthumanist accounts of “the flesh,” ultimately in  this essay she provides an account of “flesh” that is quite dif fer ent. In the  larger essay, the force of nonhuman materiality fades from view and the  materiality that concerns Spillers is specifically the flesh of h uman being,  and the power of this h uman flesh to obdurately persist even a fter ideology  has other wise denied that being’s humanity. Flesh is, as she writes, “that  </page> <page sequence="3"> Coda 163 zero- degree of social conceptualization that does not escape concealment   under the brush of discourse.” What has made her account of the flesh so  influential is her counterintuitive suggestion that nonrecognition may  also be liberating, that existing at the “zero degree of social conceptual- ization” might in fact enable the inhabitants of the flesh to instantiate an  alternative subjectivity not colonized by the dominant social order. Thus  Spillers concludes this essay by reclaiming the “monstrosity” of the flesh,  recasting the abjection of nonrecognition as an “insurgent ground” from  which to “rewrite . . . a  radically dif fer ent text” of h uman being.2 A discrepancy exists between the legibly  human agency of the flesh that  Spillers ultimately champions and the posthumanist vision of material  agency that briefly appears in her account of the  Middle Passage. For my  purposes, this article offers a case study of the difficulty of sustaining a  materialist perspective of the actions and events that we call po liti cal and  that we understand to be charged with ethical significance. Even Spillers,  who is deeply committed to thinking about how materiality resists and  exceeds ideological inscription, and who is no less deeply committed to  changing the terms in which politics is i magined, nevertheless continues  to or ga nize her account of po liti cal change around the drama of recognition  and the strug gle between competing constructions of the  human. In this  sense, her essay may be postrecognition but it is not posthumanist; like  the posthumanist and posthumanist social justice discourses I have exam- ined in Chapter  4, Spillers ultimately suspends her vision of material  complexity and entanglement to restore us to a world in which  human  agency is once again intelligible, and recognition of  human sovereignty is  once again the endgame. The question I have promised to ask h ere is w hether this move may be  ethically preferable, w hether suspending the radically materialist perspec- tive that posthumanist assemblages offer might be necessary in order to  construct a po liti cal vision we can admire. We might put this even more  polemically: the question, at its most extreme, is w hether a truly posthu- manist materialism can sustain an ethics or a politics at all. My sense is  that it cannot, but more impor tant, in t hese closing remarks I would like to  suggest that one  great advantage of studying antislavery materialism  today  is that  these nineteenth- century texts make the apolitics of materialism  vis i ble in ways that con temporary posthumanist discourse does not. Consider, by way of instructive contrast, Frederick Douglass’s account  of the insurgent slave ship in the climactic scene of The Heroic Slave. Even   after Madison Washington has seized control of the ship, the white mate,  Tom Grant, denies the legitimacy of the coup and Washington proceeds  </page> <page sequence="4"> 164 Coda to lecture to him on the justice of his revolt. But as we have seen, it is not  the ethical force of Washington’s words but rather his superior physical  force— and then the even more overwhelming force of a sudden squall—  that ends their showdown. The wind howled furiously,— the ocean was white with foam, which,  on account of the darkness, we could see only by the quick flashes of  lighting that darted occasionally from the angry sky. All was alarm  and confusion. . . . F or awhile we had dearer interests to look a fter  than slave property. A more savage thunder- gust never swept the  ocean. Our brig rolled and creaked as if  every bolt would be started . . . .   The first words [Madison Washington] uttered a fter the storm had  slightly subsided w ere characteristic of the man. “Mr. mate, you  cannot write the bloody laws of slavery on t hose restless billows. The  ocean, if not the land, is f ree.”3 Interrupting the parley between Washington and Grant, Douglass gives  this sublime storm the last word in their dispute. Still refusing to acknowl- edge that “the princi ples of 1776” might apply “to one whom I deemed my  inferior,” Grant is silenced by the squall that threatens to destroy them all.  But this is also no merely fortuitous vortex of high wind and waves: this  wind howls “furiously”; this sky is “angry.” The anthropomorphism of  Douglass’s prose turns the squall into an avenging god, an impression con- firmed by Washington’s pronouncement that the storm is a sign of nature’s  inherent hostility to “the bloody laws of slavery.” Just as Spillers imagines, ocean weather rises up in The Heroic Slave to  exert its own kind of countercultural force, compelling Grant to relinquish  his claim to “slave property.” Arguably, however, the only t hing that makes  this storm’s suspension of slavery po liti cal is Washington’s gloss of it— his  insistence that the storm is not just interruptive but insurgent, that its ma- terial force is ethically oppositional. By contrast, when Spillers conjures  the possibility of a slave ship blown off course, she offers this image as an  example of the way in which m atter’s restless volatility is ultimately hostile  to all fixed laws and systems, slaveholding or other wise. For Spillers, in  this moment, the ultimately ungovernable dynamism of the ocean- ship-  cargo- crew assemblage means that e very ideological system ultimately  rests upon precariously fluid ground. Bruno Latour also insists that the  world’s material assemblages are perpetually unsettling to po liti cal  orders.  As he writes, what the materialist perspective “calls back into question with  such remarkable effectiveness is precisely the possibility of collecting the hi- erarchy of actors and values, according to an order fixed once and for all.  </page> <page sequence="5"> Coda 165 An infinitesimal cause can have vast effects; an insignificant actor becomes  central . . .  . With po liti cal ecol ogy, one is always caught off- guard, struck  sometimes by the robustness of systems, sometimes by their fragility.”4 In  contrast to Douglass’s specifically antislavery ocean environment, the post- humanist materialism that Latour and Spillers (in her  Middle Passage  moment) embrace invites us to recognize the contingency of all po liti cal  and ethical  orders. The complexity and unpredictability of material entan- glement means that the “bedrock” of empirical real ity is, in the long view,  oceanic. This fluid materiality is at once the condition of possibility for  regimes of h uman meaning and a force for their continual upheaval. In  light of this incalculable restlessness,  every f uture is uncertain;  every  order is provisional; e very life is a life lived at sea. And herein lies the crux of the prob lem. However much we may be  tempted to conflate this restive unsettling with revolutionary insurgency,  or “lines of flight” with liberation, changefulness and open- endedness in  and of themselves are neither an ethics nor a politics.5 Posthumanism’s pro- cessualist ontology helps us to map the profusion of nonhuman agencies  and affectivities at play in  human experience and amidst the events and  procedures that we call h uman politics. This mapping shows us, for in- stance, how lead’s mobility and toxicity can re- inflect American racial  imaginaries, or how the  labor of worms can change national topogra- phies.6 And by learning to recognize t hese nonhuman dimensions of po- liti cal life, we arrive at a new and more comprehensive po liti cal realism. But  this powerfully expanded map of the entanglements of being and knowing  does not tell us what we o ught to do with its information. If the dynamic  fluidity of posthumanism’s assemblage ontology promises openings for  change, it cannot tell us what changes to wish for. Its materialist perspec- tive thus helps us to recognize the more- than- human forces that populate  politics, but it does not yield a materialist politics. This is a lesson, I would like to suggest, that antislavery materialism  brings home to us particularly vividly by virtue of the providentialism that  so explic itly supplements the embodied politics of Douglass, Thoreau, and  Whitman. In their late romantic texts, nature itself has an ethics. Thus  the physical force of Douglass’s “restless billows” is po liti cal  because for  Douglass (as we have seen), t here is an ethical code inscribed in the mate- rial order of nature. Likewise, the force of evolutionary transformation is  po liti cal in Thoreau’s hands  because for Thoreau evolution is morally pro- gressive. And if, for Whitman, we are only temporary instantiations in a  cascade of material causality (our identities, bodies, desires, and actions ar- riving on the crest of a wave of antecedent events, and departing in a froth  </page> <page sequence="6"> 166 Coda of proliferating consequences), this “vast clear scheme” of material relation- ality is nonetheless ethical  because for Whitman this fateful system is both  perfect and just.7 Thus even as  these authors confront me with the materi- ality that therefore I am, the engulfment of my liberal autonomy and the  subsumption of  human history into natu ral history do not register, in  these  accounts, as losses. For,  these authors assure us, this is an ethical world:  slavery is even now being abolished by the gravitational tug of our animal  instincts; racism is literally being driven from our hearts by evolution; ra- cial equality is already an ontological fact regardless of what auctioneers or  Supreme Court justices say. Thus if  there is a kind of fatalism in Douglass’s  invocation of “forces in operation which must inevitably work the downfall  of slavery,” in Thoreau’s r eally passive re sis tance, and in Whitman’s renun- ciation of authorial (or po liti cal) intent, each of  these authors nonetheless  greets our dispossession as a kind of grace  because he believes that nature’s  changefulness is meliorating.8 Fate is providential: we are instances of an  unfolding cosmos that is benevolently edging  toward greater perfection. We are, moreover, primed to notice the normativity of the natu ral sys- tem in t hese accounts b ecause we know t hese authors as late romantics, and  the beneficence of nature is one of t hose t hings we think of as characteristic  of romantic thought. Romanticism’s nature is strongly normative: “natu ral”  is, for the romantics, a synonym for “true” or “good.”9 Thus when, in “Frost  at Midnight” Coleridge sends his son to the countryside so that he might  “see and hear / The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible / Of that eternal  language, which thy God / Utters, who from eternity doth teach / Him- self in all,” he is speaking of a nature that is above all moral, not simply  material as empiricism frames it for us.10 Nor is this normative view of  nature limited to the ostensibly unempirical realms of romantic poetry;  through the mid– nineteenth c entury, scientific writing was similarly con- vinced of the material order’s beneficence, its empirical outlook still con- tiguous with natu ral theology. Hence Louis Agassiz understood science  to be “an investigation into the ways of nature, into the ways of the  Creator,” and his colleague Arnold Guyot could describe the earth’s geo- logical development as “the realization of an intelligent thought . . .  of  love to man, who is the end and aim of all creation.”11 Indeed, the ease with  which racial science converted into po liti cal doctrine speaks to how wide- spread the assumption was at midcentury that the material order spells out  natu ral hierarchies of being and that natu ral change is progressive, with  humankind at its cutting edge. In retrospect, the antebellum moment has come to seem like the twi- light of this mode of thought. The publication of On the Origin of Species in  </page> <page sequence="7"> Coda 167 1859 is often, if not wholly accurately, understood to have rung natu ral the- ology’s death knell and displaced romanticism’s normative nature with a  vision of materiality that refuses “anything like telos or directionality . . .  or a commitment to progressivism.”12 Although it would take several more  years to take hold, the indifferently changeful nature that Darwin intro- duced drained the moralism out of natu ral systems. Nature could no lon- ger be capitalized, and once no longer credited with a perspective or moral  aim, it also could not be credited with a politics. Against this backdrop of  romantic science and its eclipse, the renewed po liti cal impulse of con- temporary materialist discourses swims more clearly into view as an ata- vism, an impulse to return to the premise that the study of ontology may  bear ethical insights. If what the turn to ontology promises is something  like a new realism— a return to the obdurate  matter that social construc- tivism seemed to dismiss, and a reaffirmation that this fleshy real ity re- sists “concealment  under the brush of discourse”— then what we find within   these con temporary materialisms is the stealing back in of suspended  norms, the recolonization of a material system with ethical values. In this Coda and the previous chapter, I have been tracking this sub- tle yet pervasive reemergence of normativity in con temporary materi- alist discourse. Thus as we saw in Chapter 4, although posthumanist  materialism demonstrates the nonsingularity of being (its entanglement,  its constitutive being- with), posthumanist politics tend to revert to the  individualizing logic of liberal recognition, as if the proprietary values  of freedom and equality  were (as Douglass suggests) universally natu ral  demands. By this route, too, the purely material relations this ontology  maps start to seem morally laden: in posthumanist discourse, interdepen- dence starts to look like community, entanglement like obligation, mutu- ality like equality, porosity like love.13 A version of this naturalization of  ethics also occurs in posthumanist social justice theory. Again, as we have  seen, although theorists like Wynter and Spillers demonstrate that “the   human” is not a natu ral kind but a status conferred on some bodies and  not  others for ideological reasons, their politics nonetheless presume that  certain material organ izations (Homo sapiens, monsters of “the flesh”)  naturally bear humanity in them, regardless of w hether their humanness  goes unrecognized. This is how t hese par tic u lar nonhumanized organ- isms can serve, in Wynters’s and Spillers’s formulations, as instantia- tions of alternative genres of the  human— because  these bodies are  understood to always already be  human, making “the  human” once again  a natu ral kind. In t hese ways, posthumanist and posthumanist social jus- tice theories reinject systems of value into the ostensibly extra- ideological  </page> <page sequence="8"> 168 Coda material real ity to which they appeal. At the end of the day, their na- tures are normative as well. My reason for highlighting this remnant romanticism is not, however,  to call it out. On the contrary, I want to suggest its necessity. B ecause  these  discourses do not simply wish to be descriptive— because they have an eth- ics and a politics to recommend— they cannot be strictly materialist; they  must be dual- facing. At the same time, however, I think that  there is ana- lytical value in marking the distinction between descriptions of material- ity and affirmations of it. We might, then, think of the turn to ontology  not as a way to suture the divide between  matter and meaning, nor as a  surreptitious attempt to disguise policy as nature, but rather as an effort  to subject our politics to the per sis tent skepticism that materiality affords. Jasbir Puar voices one version of this thought when she suggests that  intersectional theories of identity might be productively supplemented by  assemblage theory  because  these theories are “frictional.” Assemblage  theory’s pro cessualist materialism puts pressure on the static identities,  representative politics, and recognition that intersectionality strives for.  Thus, Puar proposes, “No  matter how intersectional our models of  subjectivity . . .  these formulations may still limit us if they presume the  automatic primacy and singularity of the disciplinary subject and its iden- titarian interpellation.”14 The question therefore becomes how assem- blage theory’s skepticism of subjectivity and identity might be brought  into the po liti cal realm. If we embrace nonrepre sen ta tionalism, letting go  of positionality, identity, and their demands for recognition, what kinds  of new politics would we do? “What kinds of po liti cal strategies, of ‘poli- tics of the open end,’ might we unabashedly stumble upon? Rather than  rehashing the pros and cons of identity politics, can we think instead of  affective politics?”15 Although Puar does not answer this question, she  remains committed to the sense that it has one. I am offering a slightly dif fer ent account of the productive frictionality  that Puar describes h ere. I would like to suggest that posthumanist mate- rialism’s usefulness to politics is not a m atter of grounding (authorizing a  new politics of assemblages or affects) but of ungrounding. If politics can- not but be a system of allocating finite attention, concern, and resources,  what this materiality does is remind us that our systems of ordering are  inherently partial, exclusionary, unjust; that no  matter how posthumanist  our politics, by virtue of being politics they  will never be wholly posthu- manist. I have suggested above that posthumanism provides a vastly di- lated map of the unacknowledged constituents of politics—of the  nonhuman agents and material agencies involved and affected— but this  </page> <page sequence="9"> Coda 169 meta phor now needs qualification. If this ontological realism is a map, it is  a medieval one— pointing to the unknown in all directions, indicating  where our knowledge fails on the scale of immea sur able quantum phenom- ena, on the scale of incomputable cosmic complexity, in what Spillers de- scribes as the “figurative darkness” of the unpredictable f uture. Instead of  being used to ground or authenticate (naturalize) a po liti cal ethics, then,  posthumanism’s unmap of worldly entanglement might better serve to sug- gest the importance of not settling into our convictions. It suggests that  embracing a par tic u lar po liti cal ethic might in fact not mean committing  to a par tic u lar arrangement of politics but to constantly readjusting our  attentions and revising our sense of who and what counts. With this view, then, posthumanist materialism becomes a kind of ho- rizon  toward which our thought leans, and an abyss that our politics stare  into. The reflection it does not return flags the unavoidable mismatch be- tween our political- ideological orderings and the entangled, pro cessual,  and fi nally unpredictable “flesh” of the world. This incommensurability  may well give us reason to hope, as Spillers proposes in describing that  “richness of possibility” that even slavery could not expunge, or as, for in- stance, William Connolly suggests in describing the “fragility” of neolib- eralism’s hegemony to the chaotic dynamics of material and social systems.16  But the first lesson of this posthumanist materialism is that possibility and  fragility yield changes we ultimately cannot foresee or control. Complex- ity is thus a feature of this ontology that cuts both ways. If it is grounds  for hope that we might tip the scales t oward change, it is also grounds to  believe, as Whitman reminds us, that the changes we make  will never be  quite (perhaps not even anything like) what we meant. But in what sense is this useful? How is this reminder of the incomplete- ness of our knowledge and partiality and provisionality of our politics not  just a license for resignation? Thoreau offers an image that w ill do for my  answer when he writes of his desire not for knowledge but for “a sudden  revelation of the insufficiency of all that we called Knowledge before.” It  is, he writes, “a lighting up of the mist by the sun.”17 In other words, the  value of posthumanism’s ontology may be that it ends not in the catharsis  of exposure (what D. A. Miller describes as “the ‘flash’ of increased visibility”)  but in the brilliance of overexposure: its makes our myopias more radiant.18  Less mystically, this materialist perspective enjoins us to a form of episte- mological modesty. This is dif fer ent from the ethical modesty that  posthumanists endorse when they invite us to check our hubristic “anthro- pocentrism,” to recognize and re spect nonhuman being, and to cultivate won der  for this world. I am receptive to all of t hese ethical recommendations, but as  </page> <page sequence="10"> 170 Coda I have argued, I do not think they are endemic to or entailed by this ontol- ogy. More immediately, this ontology invites us to recognize the limits of  our practical capacity to proj ect our intentions upon a complexly rela- tional world. Unlike ethical modesty, then, epistemological modesty does not chiefly  seek to check  human hubris; if anything, it argues that we  ought to be more  ambitious in our thinking. For if the unmap of entanglement insists that  real ity  will always exceed our thought of it, and that our policies’ effects   will always overflow their intentions, by the same token it also reminds us  to remain alert to the constitutive uncertainty— the fallibility, the human- ness—of our knowledge. Just as a Falling Rocks sign resigns us to disaster  but also makes us look up, epistemological modesty can provoke us to try  to better anticipate, to the extent that we can, the unintended consequences  of our actions. Thus though it may not help us to ground our po liti cal eth- ics, a posthumanist epistemology can help us to assess the actions we take  in that ethics’ name. For by training our attention on the world’s systemic  complexity and the externalities this creates, it encourages us to build  better, more comprehensive, and dynamic models of material intercon- nections on spatial and temporal scales we are not used to imagining.  While this work of modeling is obviously an empirical endeavor, it is also  an imaginative  labor, an effort to think the unthought spidering of effects  and to conjure the unseen multiplicity of  human, nonhuman, embodied, and  discursive forces interacting upon any given site of action. This may even  be a habit of thought that reading, in par tic u lar, can help us to cultivate.19  By tracing t hese proliferating externalities, we may find ways to fold them  into better calculations of cost and risk, to take a larger view of politics’  constituents and a longer view of po liti cal action so as to better anticipate  what crop our seeds in fact sow. And if, like Whitman, we must be willing  to accept that we cannot ultimately control what results from our efforts,  we can nonetheless, like Whitman, refuse to view this as a reason to stop  working. We are launched upon unknown w aters, like always. </page> </plain_text>
