Documentary and animation Sybil DelGaudio Wt hether one defines documentary as John Grierson's 'creative treat- ment of actuality',1 or accepts Trinh T. Minh-ha's position that 'there is no such thing as documentary',2 the term, always dynamic, has undergone continual scrutiny and re-consideration throughout film history.3 From the infamous 'staged events' of Flaherty's Nanook of the North (1922), through the dramatisations of Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line (1991), each new documentary has stretched the boundaries of preceding definitions, expanding potential beyond the confinement of the set criteria of contemporary theory. In Representing Reality, Bill Nichols has sug- gested four modes of representation that 'stand out as the dominant organisational patterns around which most [documentary] texts are structured'.4 Designating modes as expository, observational, interactive and reflexive, Nichols offers an ap- proach that organises documentary into '[four] dis- tinctive approaches to the representation of reality'.5 The expository documentary (works by Flaherty and Grierson, for example), attempted to present information about the historical world and to see that world in a new way; observational do- cumentary (Leacock, Wiseman, Pennebaker) arose as a reaction to the moralising quality of expository documentary and to the availability of more mobile and synchronous equipment which provided the opportunity to record events more unobtrusively; interactive documentary (Rouch, de Antonio, Con- nie Field) arose from the desire to 'make the film- maker's perspective more evident', while reflexive documentary (Vertov, Morris, etc.) arose from a desire to 'challenge the impression of reality which the other three modes normally conveyed unproble- matically'. As the most 'self-aware' of the four modes, the reflexive mode utilises the devices of other documentaries, foregrounding such devices in an effort to emphasise them as well as the effects that they might achieve.6 Reflexive documentaries such as Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line and Dziga Vertov's Man With A Movie Camera (1929) con- stantly question the fabricated nature of the image as a mere function of the text itself. The Thin Blue Line, for example, frequently disrupts documentary practices as a means of conveying what Matthew Bernstein has termed its 'epistemological skepti- cism'.7 The film re-enacts the crime from various perspectives to remind the viewer of 'what every filmmaker knows: that every representation, how- ever fully imbued with documentary significance, remains a fabrication'.8 Particularly interesting Sybil DelGaudio is an associate professor at Hofstra University.

Since an animated film 'exists' only when it is projected - there is no pre-existing reality, no pro-filmic event captured in its occurrence - its classification as documentary can be problematic. Without any existence in the world of actuality, the animated film must, like the partially dramatised documentary, rely on a kind of artistic re-enactment, depending, in part, on imaginative rendering of one sort or another10 that may serve as compensa- tion for the camera's non-presence at the event. Recent documentary theory, such as Brian Win- ston's idea that new technologies including digital manipulation have prompted interrogation of the ontological properties of the photographic image, while computer-based technologies such as the 'Harry' can manipulate the moving image in ways that are nearly completely undetectable;11 or Philip Rosen's suggestion that cinema's reliance on 'not- able delay' (due primarily to the time it takes to 'process, manufacture and/or distribute the repre- senations') indicates a 'temporal disjunction' be- tween the event and its perception by an audience,12 demonstrate the continual questioning of both the mimetic nature of the photographic image and the reliance on its mimesis in the inves- tigation of a film's classification as documentary. I will argue that such ongoing questions open the door for consideration of certain animated films as documentaries. Animation history, which precedes live-action film history through the technology of optical toys,13 presents many examples of works that deal with 'actuality' by using animation to re-tell a story. Win- sor McCay's The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) 'documented' the infamous event of the 1 915 sink- ing of the British passenger ship by a German U- boat. The film, which represented McCay's own outrage, as well as a depiction of the event that had been widely represented in editorial cartoons of the period, was painstakingly rendered over the course of 22 months, in 25,000 drawings on clear cels.14 The film's animation technique, because of its re- semblance to live-action in some sequences and its stylistic reliance on editorial cartooning in others,15 presents a passionate and journalistically convinc- ing re-telling of an event that had never been photo- graphed. Max and Dave Fleischer16 continued in the tradition created by McCay with two films based on scientific theories. In both Evolution (1925) and The Einstein Theory of Relativity (1923), Max Flei- scher utilised techniques of combining live-action with animation as well as with still photographs and other illustrative materials, to explore and support the credibility of Darwin's and Einstein's work. Re- leased at the time of the Scopes trial, Evolution provoked the wrath of fundamentalists who ob- jected to a Darwinian view of creation.17 Later in the century, as World War II enlisted the coopera- tion of many large corporations in the war effort, Disney made Victory Through Air Power (1943), a feature-length animated film based on Major Alex- ander P. de Seversky's book asserting the superi- ority of aeroplanes over more traditional armed forces which relied on tanks and ships, and calling for the creation of an air force as an independent branch of military service.18 Critics had mixed re- actions to the film, which combined a limited style of animation with Fleischer's earlier techniques of using stills and charts, but their responses, whether negative or positive, indicated its heavily propa- gandistic approach to the subject.19 Following the war, and in an effort to maintain solvency for his studio, which was heavily in debt, Disney made many industrial and educational films for various corporations, including Dow Chemical, Texaco and General Motors, but his realisation of their limited commercial appeal discouraged him from continuing such projects, and except for a few that he considered good public relations for the studio (How To Catch A Coldin 1 951, and Our Friend the Atom in 1957 are two examples), he ceased pro- duction of non-commercial films.20 Our Friend the Atom (1957) uses the metaphor of a fisherman who casts his net and snags a small jar containing a genie who promises to grant him three wishes. The fisherman's desire to master the mighty giant that will ultimately do his bidding is likened to humankind's desire to harness the power- Sybil DelGaudio</page><page sequence="3">If truth be told, can 'toons tell it? Documentary and animation Fig. 1. The genie of the atom comes to grant humanity three wishes in Disney's animated industrial film, Our Friend the Atom (©Walt Disney Productions, 1957). ful force of atomic energy after having discovered the tiny atom that has imprisoned that force. The film goes on to identify humanity's three wishes for the use of atomic energy: power (the use of atomic energy to replace the dwindling coal and oil re- sources of our planet); food and health (the use of radioisotopes in medicine); and peace (thewise use of atomic energy for creation - not destruction).21 Carrying on the tradition of Disney corporate educational animated films, was the Bell Science Series, produced by Jack Warner for Bell Tele- phone. With several of the episodes written and directed by Frank Capra, and animation direction by such notable artists as ChuckJones, Friz Freleng and Shamus Culhane, the series attempted to 'ex- plain' scientific phenomena such as the nature of time (About Time, (1959)), the functioning of the human body (Hemo the Magnificent, 1958), the importance of heredity and environment in deter- mining human traits (The ThreadofLife, (1 957), and the mysteries of the universe (The Strange Case of Cosmic Rays, 1957), among others.22 Animated films proved a popular educational tool with adults as well as with children, and during World War II the government looked to animators for a more entertaining approach to training. The 1 8th Air Force Base Unit (also known as the First Motion Picture Unit) made animated films for the armed services, on subjects ranging from how to successfully utilise camouflage as a way of thwart- ing 'the enemy', (Camouflage, 1943) to how to shoot down an enemy plane (Position Firing, 1943). Begun in 1942 by Rudy Ising, the First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) was made up of approximately 80-100 enlisted men, officers and civil servants  191</page><page sequence="4">192 Syb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Il eGul whose assignment was to make amusing and en- gaging training films for servicemen. Organised into four units headed by ex-Disneyites Frank Thomas, Berny Wolf, Van Kaufman and Joe Smith, 'FUM-POOH', as it was known by the men who worked there, produced hundreds of animated training films for various branches of the armed services.23 Because of its location in the old Hal Roach Studio in Culver City, the FMPU was also known as 'the Fort Roach Resistance' or 'the Culver City Com- mandos', a unit which produced films that were far more successful in appealing to trainees, who watched them 'more attentively' than they did live- action films or illustrated lectures. During the war, Fort Roach turned out more animation than any studio in Hollywood.24 Among the best-remembered films produced at Fort Roach were those made by Frank Thomas' unit, which starred a character named 'Trigger Joe'. Po- sition Firing, the best known of the series, basically taught an important principle for shooting at enemy planes with greater accuracy (i.e. gunners needed to remember to take aim based not on where the enemy plane was, but on where it would be when the shot arrived). According to animator Bill Hurtz, the character was rooted in Hollywood war-film stereotypes, closely resembling the somewhat good-natured, but a bit slow-on-the-uptake roles played by actor William Bendix.25 Camouflage, a film made by the Thomas unit in which Hubley worked, presents a character not unlike Trigger Joe in design, and only slightly more intelligent than Joe in dealing with the challenges of war. Like many of the characters in these ani- mated training films, 'Dodo', as he is called, needs to be educated. Beginning with a Disney-like intro- duction to the meaning and importance of camou- flage in the animal kingdom, Camouflage presents several anthropomorphic animal characters (a but- terfly, a bird, and a deer looking remarkably like Bambi) whosewhereaboutsare protected from their 'enemies' by their capacity to blend into their natu- ral surroundings. Weare soon introduced to Yehudi the Chameleon, another Disney-like character, who, by virtue of his own natural gifts, becomes the voice of authority on 'camouflage'. Often during the war, the men Qf the First Mo- tion Picture Unit moonlighted at United Film Produc- tions, an early incarnation of what was later to become United Productions of America, or UPA. 26 In its early years, United Film Productions' work was frequently commissioned by government agencies (e.g. the State Department, Office of War Informa- tion Overseas Branch, and various branches of the armed forces, including Capra's army unit). For the Navy, United Film Productions did a series of films entitled 'Flight Safety', many of which were worked on or supervised by ex-Disney artist, John Hubley.27 Among those surviving is Flathatting (1945), a black and white animated film describing the poten- tial perils of flying too low, including showing off, hotdogging, etc., and illustrating the flatter, more stylised graphic approach that would later develop into UPA style.28 In addition, the film delves interes- tingly into the psychological history of the hotdogg- ing pilot, in an effort to understand his emotional makeup and motivation for doing what he does in the air, as well as to present the results and dangers of his unfortunate choices. If we agree that 'representing reality', in Ni- chols' words, is of critical importance to the projects of certain animated films, I will argue that the reflex- ive mode seems a particularly appropriate mode in which to situate certain animated films, since ani- mation itself acts as a form of 'metacommentary' 29 within a documentary, a form that is traditionally and most frequently characterised by live-action and non-dramatisation, particularly in the case of films which 'document the undocumentable', either because a camera has not been present atthe event, or because the event has occurred at a time prior to photography or any other type of recording.30 In the 'theoretical' documentary, i.e. documen- taries which explore and investigate theory, anima- tion prompts the viewer to a 'heightened consciousness of his or her relation to the text and of the text's problematic relation to that which it represents'.31 Even more specifically, in the case of films which explore or communicate principles of scientific theory (films such as A Brief History of Time (1992), by Errol Morris, an essentially live-action film that contains several animated images, or Of Stars and Men (1964), by John and Faith Hubley, a film that is entirely animated), animation serves to create a rupture between the signifier and the sig- nified, thus reinforcing the theoretical nature of the information presented, and foregrounding the 192 Sybil DelGaudio</page><page sequence="5">If truth be told, can 'toons tell it? Documentary and animation 193 Fig. 2. In such fully animated documentaries as Of Stars and Men (John and Faith Hubley, 1964), animation works to heighten the consciousness of the viewer's relation to the text. aforementioned 'heightened consciousness' about its 'factuality'. Since scientific theory often walks a thin line between that which is knowable or pro- vable, and that which is not, the reflexive mode emphasises the epistemological doubt inherent in the presentation of scientific theory through the me- dium of film, directly questioning knowledge by placing it in 'relation ... to issues about the ... diffi- culties of verification and the status of empirical evidence ... 32 Recently, as Nichols further points out, events such as the Rodney King tapes have suggested that the status of the photographic image's 'ontological or evidentiary nature' is far from 'cut and dried', most notably in legal proceed- ings,33 and perhaps has contributed, in part, to the degree to which subjective elements such as simu- lation have become an accepted part of documen- tary representation. As the viewer becomes more aware of the 'constructed image', questions about the adequacy of representation arise. As Nichols has queried, how can a filmmaker represent 'that which is not readily available for documentation, having occurred in the past, out of sight of any camera?'34 In the case of films that posit scientific theories, especially those that deal with such issues as the nature of time (A Brief History of Time) or the formation of the universe (Of Stars and Men), 'do- cumenting the undocumentable' becomes both a practical and a philosophical concern, directly challenging myths, not only about the'knowability' of the world,35 but also about cinema's capacity to represent it. In Errol Morris' A Brief History of Time, an investigation into the mind and theories of scientist Stephen Hawking, Morris consistently interrupts the presentation of scientific theory with images (often computer-generated, animated images) that high- light its epistemological nature while they simulta- neously question cinema's ability to represent the world of scientific theory. Morris' unwillingness to assist Hawkings in the verification of the scientist's theories is evident in his presentation of material in  If truth be told, can 'toons tell it? Documentary and animation 193</page><page sequence="6">194 Sybil DelGaudia a medium whose verifying capabilities he con- stantly questions. Since the filmmaker cannot hope to compete intellectually with the scientist's wealth of knowledge about a particular scientific subject, his skepticism is located in artistic 'metacommen- tary', speaking to viewers less about the world of scientific theory itself (a subject he knows little about in comparison to the scientist), than about the pro- cess of representation of that world. As an example of the reflexive mode of documentary, A Brief His- tory of Time constantly 'emphasises epistemologi- cal doubt [by stressing] the deformative intervention of the cinematic apparatus in the process of repre- sentation'.36 While certain animation styles (i.e. Disney hyper-realism) seem concerned with the re-creation of reality, others, such as the style pioneered by UPA and later developed byJohn and Faith Hubley, are less so.37 Hubley style, an outgrowth of the earlier UPA style, is, in fact, a direct response to Disney hyper-realism, an attempt to reveal, rather than con- ceal, that images are drawn. With its emphasis on contemporary graphics and social content Hubley style was less concerned with representational issues such asthree-dimensionality and rotoscoping than was Disney. In this regard, it seems interesting to note that John Hubley, who worked on both the Disney version of the creation of the world (i.e. the 'Rite of Spring' sequence from Fantasia (1940)) and on the Hubley version of the same event in Of Stars and Men, was in the position of being able to re- evaluate an animated documentary's approach to theories about the same event using very different styles of animation. In speaking about the Rite of Spring sequence, Hubley, who was the art director for three of the segment's eight sections (i.e. Trip Through Space/Volcanoes/ Earthquakes), explained what Disney had in mind: 'From the outset, Fantasia was conceived as a scientific document.'38 John Cul- hane reports that 'Walt explained what he wanted in fifteen simple words: "As though the studio had sent an expedition back to the earth six million years ago"'.39 Some of the volcanic activity was roto- scoped. Josh Meador, animation special effects supervisor, made vats of an oatmeal, mud and cof- fee mixture, bubbling it up with air hoses. The action was filmed with high speed cameras, while individual frames were pro- cessed on cels dyed red against a yellow back- ground. Animation was added to create more splashes and broaden the action.'40 Further attesting to its 'realism' is a statement by do- cumentary filmmaker, Pare Lorentz, who re- viewed the film in McCall's calling the sequence 'the most extraordinary motion pic- ture I've ever seen on screen: it is by far the most daring, powerful, exciting and successful portion of Fantasia.41 In quite a different approach in Of Stars and Men, the Hubleys attempted to visualise Harlow Shapley's scientific theories about the cosmos, examining its four basic entities or properties: space, time, matter and energy. The 53-minute film, based on Shapley's book of the same title, opened at the Beekman Theater in New York on 29 April 1964 to uniformly excellent reviews. In their pub- licity material, the Hubleys described their style as 'animage', defined as 'graphic arts in motion'. Writing about it years later in Film News, John Canemaker said it 'does what PBS' Cosmos does, butwith economy, directness and withoutthe didac- tic Carl Sagan'. Narrated by Shapley himself, the film looks at 'what man is and where he is in the universe of atoms, protoplasm, stars and gal- axies'.42 According to Faith Hubley, the project grew out of a desireJohn had had to do a film on Einstein's theory of relativity. Their difficulties in dealing with the Einstein estate proved to be insurmountable, and when Sidney Lumet suggested they read Sha- pley's book (at the time, Faith was working with him on 12 Angry Men, (1957)), their interest in Shap- ley's views was peaked.43 Shapley had begun his career as an astrono- mer at the Mt. Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, and from 1921-52, served as the director of the Harvard College Observatory. He was the author of half a dozen books and hundreds of scientific articles, also having made several important con- tributions to the field of astronomy, including the measurement of the diameter of the Milky Way as a galaxy, the discovery that the centre of the galaxy is 25,000 light years away from the earth in the direction of Sagittarius, thus showing the eccentric position of the Earth and Sun in the stellar universe. 194 Sybil DelGaudio</page><page sequence="7">If truth be told, can 'toons tell it? Documentary and animation Fig. 3. In a search for added realism, volcanic activity in Disney's Fantasia (©Walt Disney Productions, 1940) was partially rotoscoped over images of bubbling oatmeal. According to George Ellery Hale, the noted astron- omer whose efforts resulted in the 100-inch tele- scope on Mt Wilson, Shapley was one of the 'most daring of the younger scientists ... much more ven- turesome than other members of our staff and more willing to base far-reaching conclusions on rather slender data'. According to science historian An- thony Serafini, this was indeed a compliment, since 'good science requires some risk taking and specu- lative theorising as well'.44 Most importantly, 'his determinations proved thatour solar system was not the "centre of the universe" as earlier astronomers had believed, and that "in reality, we were negli- gently placed somewhere on the outskirts of our galaxy"'.45 In addition to their attraction to Shapley's scien- tific theories, the Hubleys were also morally, politi- cally and philosophically in tune with the astronomer. Respected while he was at Harvard, Shapley became an outcast once he began talking about his philosophy of life and his politics.46 His New York Times obituary, which refers to him as 'the dean of American astronomers', states that his entry into battles against ultranationalism, greed,  195</page><page sequence="8">196 Sybil DelGaudjo Fig. 4. While playing the festival circuit in the mid-1 9 animated Of Stars and Men sometimes competed witl films, sometimes with documentaries. hunger, pride and prejudice; his support of a policy of coexistence rather than cold war in the late 1940s, and his efforts in the fight against what he termed the 'Red hunters' of thel 940s and 1950s, while his most significant contributions outside of astronomy, made him a figure subject to criticism and abuse, and ultimately brought him to confron- tation with HUAC and SenatorJoseph McCarthy.47 In speaking aboutthe film today, Faith Hubley says: It's a visionary documentary. How can you do a documentary about life on other planets? - you have to imagine it. It's about time, space, matter and energy. It's a way to put things into bite-size relationships. There's what we know; what we forgot; and what we can imagine. It's not a documentary in the strict sense, but it is a documentary in that it records what our place in those four basic entities has been, will be, etc. It shows us how to take joy in just being a player in that universe - it's glorious ... Harlow Shapley, in my view, taught us genuine hu- mility.48 Shown at a conference at MIT's Visual Depart- ment when it was finished, Of Stars and Men was, according to Faith, 'attacked a lot'. Richard Leacock 'hated it', while Kevin Smith was 'more sympathetic'. Submitted to the Venice Film Festival, it was placed in the feature category with live action films, while atthe San Francisco Film Festival it won the documentary prize.49 In Of Stars and Men, Sha- .:...:.. .... ...... . ....... pley's voice-over narration .:Y^. : . serves as the 'representative re- ality', ostensibly the voice of ... .. authority, which is, instead, con- sistently interrogated by the use . . ... .. . . ..... of animation as 'metacommen- ; ..... tary'. In terms of the way in which it approaches questions of cinematic representation, Of Stars and Men resembles Errol 60s, the fully Morris' A Brief History of Time h live action h live action more closely than it resembles the 'Rite of Spring' sequence from Fantasia. With its stylised interviews, Morris' film 'blurs divisions between do- cumentary and feature filmmaking by conducting all the interviews on elaborate studio sets', and using computer generated imageryto relate objects from everyday life (i.e. dice, teacups) to scientific concepts.50 Morris describes the enterprise as simi- lar to that which he used in The Thin Blue Line, i.e. 'an investigation into the nature of truth'.51 In several ways, Of Stars and Men seems almost a direct reaction to the Disney approach used in Fantasia to tell a similar story. As a reflexive documentary, Of Stars and Men confronts issues of indexicality, not only by using animation, but by using a style of animation that directly challenges Disney realism. In its constant foregrounding of pro- cess, Hubley animation questions not only the ability of cinema to communicate 'truth', but, more specifically, the ability of animation to represent reality, a question that contributed, in part, to the 'graphic revolution' in animation begun by Hubley and other ex-Disney artists at UPA. The question of whether documentary should or must 'capture' re- ality is raised implicitly by Of Stars andMen's medi- tation on the issue of cinematic representation of the historical world.  196 Sybil DelGaudio</page><page sequence="9">If truth be told, can 'toons tell it? Documentary and animation Clearly this article has not considered all ani- mated documentaries, nor has it approached the crisis of naming in as comprehensive a way as the question deserves. Issues such as the placement of Norman McLaren's Neighbours (1952) and Saul Bass' WhyMan Creates (1 970) in the documentary short subject categories of the Academy Awards might be interesting to investigate, as are more recent animated 'documentaries' by Aardman Ani- mation, such as War Story (1989) and Going Equipped (1989), but these are subjects for further research. I have focused here on the reflexive do- cumentary, highlighting two films that use anima- tion to deal with scientific theory, and attempting to suggest that such films serve as a means by which a filmmaker can question the adequacy of repre- sentation in relationship to that which it represents, ultimately re-emphasising what 'every filmmaker knows: that every representation, however fully im- bued with documentary significance, remainsa fab- rication'.524 Notes 1.

As recently as 1 995, Miramax Films, in response to what it perceived as the Motion Picture Academy's egregious neglect of recent 'documentaries' from the list of nominated films in that category, called for the alteration of the name of the category, from Best Feature Documentary, to Best Non-Fiction Fea- ture, charging that the term 'documentary' had too many specifications that required veteran Academy members to eliminate from consideration certain films that did not conform to dated concepts of what documentary had been or could be. Works such as The Thin Blue Line, with its numerous dramatisa- tions, or Brother's Keeper, with its carefully or- ganised dramatic structure, have been noticeably absent from lists of nominated films in recent years, leaving the impression that the suspected backlash against successful theatrically released documen- taries, is more accurately a matter of the crisis of naming than it is an angry punishment aimed at films that have had too much commercial success. 4.

As 'inconclusive' as Nichols suggests that Morris' evidence ultimately is, it seems ironic that the film itself became the impetus for Randall Adams' re- lease from prison after twelve years. Here was a situation in which the film itself had a significant impact on the actual case, thus suggesting that Morris' argument was accepted - at least by those whose opionion held some weight - as 'truth'. 10. Animation, often defined as a film created one frame at a time, may be drawn or painted on cels or various kinds of paper, but there are other alternatives to drawn animation, among them stop- motion (using puppets, models, clay figures, etc.) and the more recent computer animation. 'Camera- less animation', i.e. animation created by drawing or painting directly on film, does not rely at all on the process of recording an image with a camera. 11.

By 1919, Bray's instructional films were being ordered from private industry as well as from government sources, and even prompted a re-organisation of his studio's priorities to cover the demand (157-8).

Max and Dave Fleischer, who opened their own animation studio in 1921, made odd and original films, using memorable characters such as Betty Boop and Popeye in mostly short works that pro- vided a stylistic alternative to Disney hyper-realism.

Both reviews deal with the film as a purveyor of 'truth', however subjective, never seeming to object to its use of animation to convey point of view. 20. Ibid., 183 21. Disney's homespun approach to atomic energy as our 'friend' differs markedly from the view of nu- clear energy communicated by animation film- makers, John and Faith Hubley, in their 1963 film, The Hole (1963). In this film, two demolition workers have a discussion on the frightening potential of nuclear war. The Academy-Award winning film, with voices and improvised dialogue by George Mathews and Dizzy Gillespie, stands as a chal- lenge, not only to the supporters of the 'useful' nature of atomic energy, but also to Disney's naive acceptance of the idea that world powers will use the atom only in the wisest ways. 22.

Ellis, the Ford Foundation Professor of American History at Mount Holyoke College and the author of American Sphinx: the Character of Thomas Jefferson, writes that when Ken Burns asked him to appear on camera in a documentary Burns was making on Jefferson, Ellis warned that Jefferson was not an appropriate subject for a documentary. 'You cannot make a documentary film about Thomas Jefferson ... because Jefferson predates the photograph ... [Burns' style] could not work for an eighteenth century subject'.

Throughout their collaboration and as they con- tinued to experiment with style and subject matter, the Hubleys won numerous international awards, including three Oscars out of seven nominations. Following John's death in 1977, Faith's commitment to independent filmmaking has continued, and she has made approximately one film per year since then, struggling constantly with the difficulties of finding funding for projects that represent the purity of artistic expression with concern for commercial success clearly secondary. Her subjects have ranged from the Amazon rainforest (Amazonia, 1990), to child advocacy (Step by Step, 1978), to the nature of time (Tall-Time Tales, 1993), and her work is consistently inspired by her fascination with the art and mythology of other cultures, including native American astronomical myths (Starlore, 1983), Australian Aboriginal art (Cloudland, 1994) and Hawaiian mythology (Rainbows of Ha- waii, 1995), to name just a few. 38.
