<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASTROLOGY AND IRONY IN CHAUCER'S COMPLAINT OF MARS by Edgar S. Laird In Chaucer's Complaint of Mars, a series of celestial events enacts the myth of the adultery of Mars and Venus. Mars and Venus enter into planetary conjunction with one another in the zodiacal sign of Taurus, which is one of Venus' astrological "houses."1 Then the near approach of the sun, technically called "burning" or "combustion," causes Venus to flee, leaving Mars alone and distressed (281-89). Part of his distress derives from his belief that Venus too is alone and dis tressed. But in fact she is being welcomed and comforted by Mer cury as his "frend ful dere" (142-47). The situation constitutes a notable and often-noted irony which, I believe, is extended by Mars' continuing conviction that Venus "never dide but al gentilesse" (297). Venus' "gentilesse" sounds suspect partly because the astrological terms in which the narrative is conducted indicate, I believe, that Venus becomes Mercury's mistress.2 The relationship between Venus and Mercury, like the initial re lationship between Venus and Mars (described in 50 f.), is rendered in terms of "aspects," which are astrologically significant angular dis tances between planets. Mercury, riding homeward, is said to "se" Venus in his "paleys" (145), which is to say, in the sign Gemini, one of Mercury's "houses."3 As J. M. Manly pointed out long ago, to "see," 1. The conjunction is said to occur in Venus' "nexte paleys" (54; I quote from the edition of F. N. Robinson, The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, 2nd. ed. [Bos ton, 1957]). Venus has two positions of increased influence called palaces, houses, mansions, or the like: Taurus and Libra. That Taurus is here intended is indicated by several considerations, the most conclusive of which is that in Chaucer's time the sun entered Taurus on April 12 and the poem says that the sun enters Venus' palace on April 12 (81-82 and 139). 2. Gardiner Stillwell (PQ, 35 [1956], 73) casts suspicion on "whatever goes on in Mercury's mansion," but he also remarks that "Chaucer does not go so far as to say that Venus becomes Mercury's mistress: "Convention and Individ uality in Chaucer's Complaint of Mars." 3. Venus is said, at 113, to be in Mercury's "tour," which, I take it, refers to his astrological "mansion," although scholars have only hesitantly accepted such a reading. (See Robinson's note on 1. 113.) However, the reading is sup ported by a treatise in the Trinity College, Cambridge MS. 0.5.26, where tour is used to mean "zodiacal sign": "We han made divisiouns of J&gt;e 12</page><page sequence="2">230 chaucer's complaint of mars in an astrological poem, is to be in aspect.4 Medieval astrologers recognized four aspects: "opposition," which is separation of planets by 180?; "trine," which is separation by 120?; "quartile," which is separation by 90?; and "sextile," which is separa tion by 60?. Venus and Mercury are never far enough apart to be in any aspect but sextile. The poem gives us the following information about the configura tion in which Venus and Mercury are involved. It tells us that the sun enters Taurus, which in Chaucer's time meant that the date was April 12.5 It tells us that Mars and Venus separate and Venus arrives at 2? Gemini.6 And it tells us that while Mars is lamenting the loss of Venus, the date is still "this twelfte daye of April" (139). The sun, therefore, is still at 1? Taurus. Mercury can never, in astronomical fact, be more than 29? from the sun, and within the range of 29? from 1? Taurus, Mercury, to be in aspect with Venus, must be at 2? Aries, which is, indeed, 29? from the sun.7 The typically Chaucerian neatness of the arrangement is satisfying, and, perhaps more impor tant, its precision and astronomical accuracy indicate how carefully and deliberately Chaucer arranged his sextile aspect. That Venus and Mercury should be in sextile aspect is interesting, in this anthropomorphic poem, because of the anthropomorphic way in which astrologers described the nature of aspects. The general metaphor for expressing the accord or discord supposed to obtain between planets in aspect with one another was one of loving or hating. One way to distinguish degrees of accord or discord was to tours, l&gt;at is, of fce 12 signes ..." (f. 77). Mercury's "tour," then, would be a sign belonging to him, and Gemini, where Venus is, belongs to him as one of his "mansions." J. D. North, "Kalenderes Enlumyned Ben They," RES, 20 (May, 1969), 139, citing the same MS evidence as I have done, concludes that tour means "sign." However, my reading receives independent icono graphic support in Chauncey Wood, Chaucer and the Country of the Stars (Princeton, 1970), p. 150 and Figs. 20 and 21. 4.

She is "two pas" (121) within "Cilenios tour." 7. W. W. Skeat, The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, I (Oxford, 1894), 501 f., notes that the poem says Mercury is in Venus' "valaunse" (145) and sug gests that valaunse is a variant of fallance, an Old French equivalent of the Latin detrimentum. Since Venus has an astrological detrimentum in only Scorpio and Aries and since Mercury, in the poem, cannot be in Scorpio, he must be in Aries. It is true that Skeat locates Mercury among the latter de grees of that sign, but Manly, Studies and Notes, 5, 123, shows that a loca tion in the latter degrees is unnecessary and improbable. I hope to publish shortly a note glossing valaunse and making the planetary relations clear.</page><page sequence="3">EDGAR S. LAIRD 231 say that the love or hate was perfect or imperfect, half or whole. But an alternative expression is more pertinent to the present case: the love or hate may be "manyfest" or it may be "privy and secret."8 Sextile is the aspect of "privy and secret" love and is therefore exactly suitable for denoting a clandestine relationship between Venus and Mercury. I have said above that the planets enact the myth. Perhaps I should have said they eternally re-enact the eternal myth: since the heavens and heavenly processes were supposed to be eternal and unchanging, the planetary pattern, like the myth, is outside time and accident. In the poem Chaucer uses god-stars to present, in effect, an eternal and essential model of love, or at least of a certain type of love. Mars and Venus, with all their elaborate mythical and astrological associa tions, relate, in a richly complicated way, Knighthood to Ladyhood. They are, as the poem tells us, the well-springs and sources of Knight hood and Ladyhood (75 and 174-81). They are the general forms of such particular lovers as Troilus and Criseyde.9 It is therefore im portant to read the implications of the sextile aspect and note that the Complaint of Mars, like Troilus and Criseyde, includes betrayal among the conventional pains of love. Southwest Texas State University 8. The terminology referred to in this paragraph is fairly standard. The quota tions are from the Trinity College, Cambridge MS. R.15.18, III, which is a continuation of Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe. The discussion of aspects occurs at ff. 26-29. "[Sextile aspect] is of an inp[ar]flte amite and love, or ellis this aspect is of not manyfest frenship but a privy and secret benevo lens." It would be a mistake to press the apparent opposition of "amite and love" to "frenship" and "benevolens." A little familiarity with the author's style convinces one that a naive principle of rhetorical variation is responsible. 9. The parallel between Mars and Venus and Troilus and Criseyde has been drawn by Neil Hultin, "Anti-Courtly Elements in Chaucer's Complaint of Mars," Annuale Mediaevale, 9 (1968), 58 ff.</page></plain_text>
