<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITORIAL Professionalism In Advertising The terms "professionalism," "professional," "pro- fession," and "professor" all entail within their scope of meaning the existence of standards - standards of some kind and quality as measured by specifiable criteria. Thus, the degree to which a given person, discipline, or professional school satisfies these cri- teria, an appropriate grade can be assigned such as Highly Professional, Semi-Professional, or Non-Profes- sional. In addition, all such criteria are genuine propositions, which is to say, their truth-value is directly or indirectly determinable. Thus, a profession is not something that is established by (say) taking a vote of all the "professionals" that temporarily in history happen to be associated with the discipline. Such a practice would only beg the question as to what constitutes a "professional" in that discipline, and would allow the truth of the criteria involved to be decided within a socio-political milieu. And, in an era of egalitarianism, it allows the criteria of a pro- fession to be decided equally by knowledged and non- knowledged individuals alike. Clearly, a "profession" determined in this manner would not be a profession at all. A profession, therefore, is actually, and quite literally, determined by the quality of knowledge it represents. Some knowledge is true, some is false. And, in terms of the history of science, we note that false knowledge is frequently agreed (voted) to be "true knowledge" by its practitioners. (Cf., Lavoisier, Galileo, Boyle, Pasteur, Mendel, Harvey, et al). THERE EXIST LEVELS OF KNOWLEDGE A profession can be measured in reference to the various levels of knowledge that its subject matter validly entails; some epistemic continuum ranging from brute empiricism on the one end to scientific theory on the other. Thus, any given explanation, say, about a specific advertisement or commercial, will, in fact, fall at a certain level on this knowledge spectrum. At the one end exist explanations that tell us what something is, how something is done, facts and events, intermixed with a generous use of demonstratives and pointing. This is the region of vocational-technological type of knowledge. At the other end exist those more abstract explanations whose burden it is to coherently relate all of those facts and events found at the op- posite end. Current explanations of advertising are mostly at the vocational-technological level. And we note that explanations at this level have failed to coherently explain when a specific advertisement has succeeded in the purpose for which time and money has been spent for its construction, i.e., to coherently explain when its intended meanings have been, in fact, elicited. The facts are that the vocational-technological type of explanations have been epistemologically inadequate to handle something as complex as the human mind; the facts are that they have failed in history to produce coherent measurements of units of meaning, attitudes, and beliefs. Professionalism in advertising is determined in reference to the knowledge spectrum that is proper for its subject matter. Professionalism in advertising, therefore, has to do with the level of knowledge a person actually possesses about this subject matter. But, when the type of knowledge centers at the voca- tional-technological level (i.e., with what- and how- type knowledge), then the professional status of the remaining part of the knowledge spectrum becomes unimportant, if not actually irrelevant. In this way, the advertising profession is defined strictly in reference to knowledge possessed about specific facts and events, about what- and how-type activities. Genuine theoreti- cal considerations are quickly voted down because they are regarded as "blue ski" and lacking in any "'practical," "real world" application. And, as a con- comitant, a more scientifically powerful type of knowledge - which lies considerably above this level - has been effectively inhibited from any serious pursuit. Thus, under the dominance of egalitarianism, today's ideas and methods remain tomorrow's ideas and methods - except for a periodic change in identifying labels. What is at stake here in this struggle upward is not merely the level of knowledge that the advertising profession represents, but also, the only means where- by government intervention in the free market system via the control of advertising can be effectively chal- lenged. THE PERTINENT QUESTION The pertinent question is this: what is the prog- nosis for moving upward to higher levels of knowledge that are capable of explaining the phenomena of which advertising is concerned - either in universities, agencies, or client organizations? The answer to this question involves an analysis of some hard issues that hold some rather serious implications for our society as a whole. In terms of professionalism in advertising, they are hard issues because (a) they involve an implicit confrontation with all those persons who sincerely believe in main- taining the current level of knowledge about adver- tising, and (b) because they involve an upgrading of advertising knowledge which runs counter to the philosophy of egalitarianism that is currently so wide- spread in our universities. This current crisis in higher education has never been better analyzed than in a recent article in the Wall Street Journal that discusses the concerns of Harvard social scientist David Riesman: " . ..super- 48</page><page sequence="2">egalitarian pressures - from dissatisfied students, faculty, and outsiders - have been undermining many of the methods and values that long gave colleges and universities their coherence and direction . . . " "The influence of presidents, deans and senior department men in selecting faculty has also been diluted. Junior faculty and even students claim ever- larger voices in the process; often they tend to judge on grounds of political philosophy or personality rather than real academic achievement." "Many of the younger faculty, rebelling against the former emphasis on 'publish-or-perish' research, insist they'll concentrate exclusively on teaching, but, says Prof. Riesman, 'teach-or-perish has its dangers, too.' It not only cuts back on the inquiry and research that any institution of higher education ought to carry on, but it also makes the instructors heavily dependent for advancement on the size and enthusiasm of their student following. This leads to conscious or uncon- scious competition for students - with pop courses that have special appeal, less required work, inflated grades" (emphasis added). These are some of the hard issues involved in analyzing professionalism in advertising. Not only are there many vested interests for maintaining the present level of knowledge in advertising, but the intense politicization of our universities is rapidly destroying this major source for the advancement of knowledge in our society. And what this situation implies for upgrading the quality of advertising education is most serious, indeed. In a major article in the Wall Street Journal, Dr. George H. Hildebrand of Cornell Univer- sity recently remarked that the outlook was fairly grim. "I don't think there is any will to get back on the track of a traditional university," he said. "The problem of politicizing an institution is that it's very hard to clean it up again." Perhaps our point can be made better in market- ing terms, in reference to the distribution of knowl- edge regarding advertising. The participants in this channel system - its producers (universities), middle- men (agencies) and consumers (clients) - appear to have actually set limitations, channel restraints, on the level of professionalism allowed to be practiced by its channel members. In this regard, it is critical to note what is true of any marketing system, namely, that it is the final user that determines the type and quality of product lines that are offered in any given distribution channel. However, clients, as final users, if they are to effect any changes in this channel sys- tem, will have to learn enough information about the psychological and philosophical problems involved in communication research to be able to ask the per- tinent questions of their agencies and of their new employees from universities. While there are some formidable obstacles to up- grading the quality of professionalism in advertising, we believe that these obstacles are not insurmountable. It depends ultimately on whether we have the will to make some necessary changes, the will to create an intellectual environment where there exists a genuine competition of ideas. The facts of history clearly seem to indicate that a materialistic monism in psychology, as with a materialistic monism in philosophy, is simply not valid for the real world. In universities, we don't have to restrict our curricula in the human sciences to some variant of anthropomorphic empiricism. In client organizations, we don't have to continue spend- ing corporate funds on anthropomorphic research alone. In agencies, we don't have to pursue only the vocational-technological approach to communication research. It is noted that throughout history the struggle to push back the frontiers of knowledge has never been easy - even where left unfettered by social and political intervention. But, where the pursuit of truth in the human sciences is made dependent upon a politicized egalitarianism for its support, any such efforts are very likely to be expressions of what is currently in popular favor. The point is that if the type of research perform- ance that wins the most votes at the Faculty Committee on Salaries, Tenure and Promotion is at the level of anthropomorphism, and, if this is the level of profes- sionalism that has been allowed to become institu- tionalized within our universities by means of a politicized egalitarianism, then it is very hard to see how the advertiser can hope to receive better explana- tions of what he is getting for his advertising dollar. And, concomitantly, it is equally difficult to see how the discipline of advertising can hope to advance beyond its present embryonic level of development under these circumstances. Dr. Harold G. Cassidy of Yale University remarks that "the bulk of our laity and the majority of our college students are extraordinarily illiterate in science . . . many students seem not to believe in a reality independent of their wishes; they seem deeply ignorant of the relation between cause and effect; what they do not know seems not to worry them. They are ignorant of their own ignorance and seem not to think seriously of consequences. They are in a basic sense irresponsible" (emphasis added). It would appear that when physical symbols - such as words - are magically identified with human qualities, when biological substance is literally equated to the consumer's mind, when statistical explanations become an acceptable substitute for scientific explan- ations, then it would seem that there is a message in Cassidy's words for those advertisers who are genuinely interested in receiving better advertising-consumer behavior research, in receiving a more professional accountability for their advertising dollars. In any case, it seems quite plain that if serious efforts are not made somewhere to move upward and out of anthropomorphism, then there exists little pos- sibility within the present channel system for achiev- ing better professionalism in advertising than what we have now.
