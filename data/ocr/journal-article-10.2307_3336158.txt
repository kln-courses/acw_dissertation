<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dance in the Vai Sande Society LESTER P. MONTS Among the Vai of Liberia, a secret society called Sande plays an important role in the transition of females from adolescence to adulthood. Traditionally the society provided training that ranged in scope from sex education to the making of fishing nets. Today the infusion of public school education, modern feminism, and Islam has resulted in some noticeable changes in the Sande, but the institution continues to thrive as an important part of Vai society. One of the hallmarks of the Sande experience is the em- phasis placed on dance. The significance of Sande dance (sande tiimbiib) in the female socialization process is paramount; it is a key element in the activities that occur throughout the three- year initiation session, and it provides a focal point for the ex- pression of social responsibility and loyalty among women. Equally important is its entertainment aspect. Public activities of the Sande are considered major social events, and people from surrounding towns and as far away as the Vai enclaves in Monrovia are frequently in attendance. Dance has apparently played an important role in Sande ritual and ceremonial activi- ties for centuries. The Dutch writer Dapper (1670) reported Sande ceremonies involving dance that are similar in many re- spects to those observed today.2 In 1977-78, Sande was in the second year of its three-year cycle,3 and I was fortunate to observe three major types of dance performed in public: initiate dancing by troupes called tbmb6 kI biibnie-nu (sing. tbmbdi k' biini), masked dancing by the society's spirit impersonator, Zooba, and group dancing on spe- cial ceremonial occasions by all initiated members of the soci- ety. These three forms will be presented here. Other dance types, such as those used for educational purposes, are con- fined to the bondo (the bush area where girls are secluded and where secret activities take place), and specific details regard- ing them are not revealed to non-Sande members. The course of instruction in the Sande often involves the use of song and dance. Its graduates-nearly all Vai women- appear to possess a higher competence as singers and dancers than do men.4 Within the Sande, a special troupe is organized for initiates who show an aptitude for dancing. An itinerant professional musician, the kengai, spends seven to ten days per month instructing these girls, and she may have three or four additional groups of girls under training in Sande lodges in distant towns. The society's officials often vie for the services of a particular kengai, since a well-trained dance troupe can bring prestige and economic rewards to their lodge and town. Participation in a dance troupe can be rigorous and time- consuming. Besides possessing the necessary physical skills, each initiate must be able to learn the choreographed move- ments, interpret the complex speech surrogates of musical in- struments, and improvise dance patterns effectively. In addi- tion, those who perform in the dance dramas must have some acting ability. For the initiate dancer, all this requires a time commitment to the Sande that goes far beyond that of the normal inductee. Girls chosen to be dancers are usually in se- clusion for the full three-year term, whereas other initiates stay for as little as two weeks. Until recently, initiate dance troups remained in the bush until the final graduation ceremony, when they would be fea- tured as part of the overall proceedings. Today it is common to see troupes performing at a number of social functions, such as ceremonies for visiting dignitaries, the installment of a par- amount chief, or funerary activities. In the rural areas this change was inspired in part by the manner in which the Na- tional Cultural Troupe in Monrovia has promoted various as- pects of Liberian culture. Since its inception in 1965, it has maintained musicians, dancers, and other artisans from the country's sixteen ethnic groups, among them Sande dance troupes that perform for tourists, embassy officials, visiting statesmen, and on other special occasions. Influences of a professional-economic nature have penetrated into the rural Vai areas, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of well- trained troupes performing at various events for pay Maintaining a Sande lodge is enormously expensive for the girls' families and the town where it is held. The economic gain from performances by initiate dance troupes helps offset some of the costs incurred throughout the three-year period. For the dancers alone, a fairly large investment is necessary to purchase costumes, to hire a music instructor, and to travel. According to contemporary reports, the recent move toward the semi-professionalization of Sande troupes in rural Vai 1.

Today the dance skills acquired in the society may serve as a foundation for career opportunities elsewhere. After graduation, many former bibni dancers continue to perform in cultural troupes sponsored by the public schools, while others aspire to become a kengai or the masked dancer Zooba. The ultimate success is recruitment by the National Cultural Troupe. One of the most prestigious troupes during the period of my field research in 1978 was located in the northern Tew6 chiefdom town of Kobilya. I had seen this troupe at funerary activities and holiday celebrations several times over a six- month period and was struck by the quality of their perfor- mance. Because of the rapport that I subsequently established with the kengai of that lodge, arrangements were made to film and photograph a performance of dance drama. Seven girls were chosen to perform this particular drama. Their ages ranged from ten to fifteen years, which is the ap- proximate age of most Sande initiates. Their costumes reflect recent influence, including that of the National Cultural Troupe. The skirts and arm streamers, traditionally made of raffia, have been replaced by a more durable synthetic mate- rial. Until recently, all Sande dancers performed bare- breasted, but today, as a "standard of decency," some wear specially woven or ordinary brassieres; and instead of the tra- ditional headdress, many dancers perform in a Western-made wool stocking cap. The accompanying music ensemble (Fig. 1) includes the ken- gai, who performs on a gourd rattle called sasaa (pl. sasaa-nu). She directs the musicians and dancers, using various rhythmic patterns on the sasaa to signal the dancers to proceed to different segments of the drama. As lead vocalist, it is also the kengai's responsibility to start the songs that are appropri- ate to each scene. A chorus (lang bila mii-nu), made up of older Sande women, sings response lines to the kengai. Other in- strumentalists include a slit-gong player (keleng seng m5bi), who performs in rhythmic unison with the lead sasaa, 5 and an addi- tional sasaa player (sasaa kiili bb mb), who provides pulse ac- companiment. In addition, the dancers wear pod-shaped rat- tles called weng weng attached just below the knees. When all the dancers are performing the same movements, the jingling adds to the rhythmic accompaniment of the music ensemble. A performance of dance drama constitutes only a portion of a dance troupe's public exhibition. During the initial part of the event, various -dances showcase the skills members acquired during seclusion in the bondo. Part of their training includes complex choreographed dance styles (tambb kili-nu) that are executed on signals from the sasaa. Some of these styles were borrowed from Mende and Gola initiate dance troupes and have names such as yagbe and gowee (Mende) and dingbung (Gola). Each dance is performed by the entire troupe, and the movements are closely coordinated with and reflect the ac- companying sasaa rhythms. For example, the rhythm for yagbe is built around an eight-beat pattern divided into six beats and two beats. During the first six beats the dancers, arranged in line formation, alternate left and right foot movements in a sta- tionary position, then move forward on the last two beats. Not all dancers are bound to a fixed rhythmic accompaniment. The improvisatory skills nurtured during training are displayed in a wide range of dazzling executions by individual girls. During these sequences the instrumentalists improvise rhythmic pat- terns according to dance movements. The dramatic repertoires of Sande initiate dance troupes cover a wide range of subjects. The performance that will be described here is a reenactment of the various stages of a hunt- ing expedition and is called bE bhuki timbi kina. It follows, with startling detail, a series of events as described to me by a Vai master hunter (bhukU mi5). For descriptive purposes these events are divided into three scenes: the pre-hunt ritual, the hunt, and the post-hunt ritual. In the opening scene the master hunter, his chief associate (bhuki kali bb m6i), and several followers (bhuki~ i ftlZ mbe-nu) announce to the town that the hunt is about to commence. Two girls, in the roles of the master hunter and his associate, lead their followers into the dance arena (Fig. 3). As the troupe's most proficient dancers, these two girls perform the principal roles in a majority of its dramatic presentations. In an actual hunt, the hunter's followers would serve as flushers and noisemakers, responsible for forcing the prey into an area where it could be killed by the master hunter or his associate. In this scene, the entire troupe parades around the dance arena while performing gestures in imitation of the prey they intend to pursue. The master hunter is armed with a toy rifle (bhu), and his apprentice with a spear (tamba). This Sande dance incorporates the same movements and song accompan- iment used by actual hunters in their traditional dances and songs. The action then shifts to the bush, where the hunter's followers have flushed the prey into an open area, and the master hunter and his associate begin to stalk the animal for the kill. In the second scene, the master hunter and his associate cautiously close in on the prey, proceeding along the perimeter of the arena in a crouching position. In the center of the arena, one dancer stands on a raffia mat to represent the bush or a large tree, and a second dancer, portraying the animal, crawls around her (Fig. 2). To dramatize the kill, the rifle or spear must be thrown onto the mat. Because the hunters approach the prey with caution, two attempts to do so are unsuccessful. Fol- lowing each attempt the hunters retrieve their weapons and perform a brief dance, with their hands raised and their faces turned to the sky, calling for the assistance of their spirit power TOP: 3.

At this time the townsmen, who have been situated along the perimeter of the dance arena, are summoned to assist in preparing the prey for being borne to town. The trip back is preceded by a dance that cele- brates the kill, during which the hunters move warily toward the prey, touching it with their weapons (Fig. 4), then quickly retreating (Fig. 6), dramatizing a precautionary measure taken to make sure the animal is dead and not merely wounded. Then the dancer portraying the master hunter enacts removing its tail as a trophy. As this scene doses, the townsmen kneel around the prey and apportion it for trans- port back to town (Fig. 7). In the final scene, the hunting party returns home. As proof of a successful hunt, the master hunter, waving the tail over- head, leads his followers in a procession through town. After the drama has concluded, the dancers parade around the arena soliciting money from "big men"-the chiefs, elders, and out-of-town guests. In addition to being entertainment, dance dramas preserve the lore and traditions of the society. Because large game has virtually disappeared from the Vai region, an actual hunting ceremony of this magnitude is rarely if ever performed. Its de- tails, however, are recorded in this Sande performance. The second major type of Sande dance is masked dancing. Masking traditions among the Vai have undergone several stages of transition over the past few decades. This is espe- cially true for the male masqueraders, which many observers thought were spirit impersonators of the Poro society. Masks worn by Vai male dancers were exported from the Mende and the Gola during the early part of this century. These dancers have no spiritual importance and are not in either form or function connected with the Poro society. Sponsored by indi- vidual wealthy men or groups of men through quasi-secret societies called Gb6nji-nu, their association with Poro by past observers derives from the fact that formerly one had to be a Poro member in order to be eligible to wear a mask. (Masked dancing was like any manly endeavor: Poro membership was a prerequisite to participation in it.) Male masked dancers among the Vai are merely professional entertainers who, along with musicians, perform at a variety of social activities for pay. The Vai call them timbb kU feng miR-nu (literally, "plaything people").6 Their lack of ritual function sets them apart from masks of the same name and with the same costume design among the neighboring Mende and Gola. Siegmann and Pe- rani (1976), who have addressed many of the cross-cultural differences of the male masked dancers in southern Sierra Leone and northern Liberia, also found that the spiritual as- sociation of certain male masqueraders with the Poro dif- fers from one ethnic group to another. The situation regarding the spiritual role of the Vai Sande masked dancer Zooba (Fig. 5) (literally, "Big Zoo") is a quite different matter. Zooba is the personification of supernatural power, and the term nyana ("spirit") is often used by the Vai to identify her.7 Moreover, the term zoo designates a person who possesses expert skill at an art or craft. In the case of Zooba, the expert skill is dance. The Zooba has been a part of Vai Sande for well over one hundred years. There are a number of citations by Koelle, Biit- tikofer, and Ellis on the ritual and spiritual role of this dancer since the mid-nineteenth century.8 Similar masked dancers exist among other ethnic groups in the region: Sowie among the Mende, the Zogbe among the Gola and Dei. Itinerant maskers from these ethnic groups are frequently seen at Vai Sande activities. Within and outside the confines of the Sande, the Zooba serves as an agent of social control and is the bearer of power- ful Sande medicines.9 However, some of its controlling power has been diminished by civil laws of the Liberian government. In the past, Sande women, bolstered by the wrath of Zooba, could levy heavy fines upon men (and uninitiated women) who violated laws protecting Sande and women in general. Today, many such violations are judged by government- appointed commissioners or civil courts. Yet the fear, and even the contempt, on the part of men for the Zooba today remains strong. This is clearly seen in the efforts of the male-controlled Muslim religion to rid Vai country of the Zooba form of Sande and replace it with an Islamic version called Mori Sande. Fear of the Zooba is often attributed to her awesome, terrify- ing appearance. Although each mask is unique, standard fea- tures include an anthropomorphic helmet with small slit eyes and neck rings at the base. The mask and the entire costume are painted or dyed black, except on some festive occasions such as a Christmas celebration when colorful fiber is sewn to the costume. Some carvers tack on small strips of aluminum or tin to the mask to emphasize its depth and character. The research of Ruth Phillips, who has done the most detailed studies of Sande masking traditions throughout the Liberia- Sierra Leone region (1972, 1978, 1979), indicates a regional dis- tribution of Sande (or Bundu) maskers, but she acknowledges that even among individual ethnic groups there is considera- ble variation in the manner in which masks are carved. 5. THE SANDE SPIRIT IMPERSONATOR, ZOOBA. TOP: 6. TOWNSMEN CELEBRATE THE KILL. BOTTOM: 7. APPORTIONING THE PREY. 56</page><page sequence="5">:i i ~- ih i 1-` r 'IL gs;- i</page><page sequence="6">The dancer is draped in a coat of raffia that hangs from the shoulders to just below the knees. Men's black pants and black shoes are worn underneath. The dancer carries a cane or a twig to communicate with musicians and an attendant, who clears the dance area of large stones and assists other women with crowd control. The attendant also carries a rolled-up cane mat that is used to cover the dancer in case a portion of the costume falls off during a vigorous dance sequence or to shield the door of the zoo house (zoo keng) that the dancer enters. Each town has such a house, where the Zooba costume and other Sande paraphernalia are kept. The women of Sande go to great lengths to preserve the anonymity of the masker. For example, on occasions when the Zooba is to perform, seven or eight women will enter the zoo house, but only three or four exit, leaving some doubt as to which one is the dancer. The Zooba impersonates the Great Spirit of Sande at a number of rituals and ceremonies.10 Because they are shrouded in secrecy, it is difficult, especially for men, to obtain details about the spiritual role of the Zooba in these activities. For the Mende, Phillips (1978) has reported several occasions when the spirit impersonator Sowie participates in key rituals, and many of these appear to parallel those of the Vai Sande. However, there is a great degree of variation in Vai Sande ceremonies. I attended four different graduation ceremonies when the Zooba was present, and her participation was signif- icantly different each time. When questioned about these in- consistencies, those apparently the most knowledgeable on Sande matters were extremely vague. While the general public normally sees the Zooba only in her capacity as a dancer, the fact remains that her presence is indeed necessary at several Sande ceremonies, and without her participation they would not be considered valid. Practically every town that has an active Sande lodge main- tains ownership of one or more Zooba dancers. In the unlikely event that a lodge is initiated in a town without a Zooba, one may be borrowed for ceremonial and ritual occasions. Con- struction of the costume and the masker's dance training are the responsibility of the individual lodge. Traditionally, the mask is made by the Poro society carver; however, women have recently begun to commission them from itinerant car- vers or purchase them from street vendors in Monrovia. Ex- pert dancing skill is expected throughout the masker's career. There have been reports of the banishment of Zooba dancers from some Sande jurisdictions for falling during a perfor- mance.11 In the distant past, punishment for such a mistake was death. If the Zooba falls during a performance today, it is believed that the Great Sande Spirit will become acerbated and cast its wrath on the entire country. As a result, Sande officials are compelled by traditional law to relinquish "the country" (the bush) immediately to the Poro society. To guard against such catastrophe, a new masker must display a satisfactory level of dancing skill in a ceremony called mua zooba nama kibi ("We have a new Zooba"). During this ritual, the new masker is not allowed to enter the town, but must proceed along the town's perimeter, stopping at four designated points to per- form a prescribed set of dance movements before Sande offi- cials and other accomplished Zooba dancers. Once the new dancer meets the approval of this delegation, she is allowed to take part in Sande activities as a full-fledged Zooba. Besides its role in Sande activities, the Zooba is often used to fulfill many of the same entertainment roles as the male masked dancers. It is quite common, then, to see her perform- ing at funeral feasts, holiday celebrations, and other major so- cial events. Phillips views the appearance of Sande maskers at such events as "a means of impressing on the community the unity and strength of the female corporate body" (1978: 272). Even in these situations, appropriate behavior on the part of men and uninitiated women is expected. Men, for example, are not allowed to come within a certain distance of the dancer. An accidental bump by a man can, without proper settlement, result in a fine, the contraction of scrotal elephantiasis, or a number of other Sande reprisals. There are several occasions when the Zooba is not allowed to perform. During the time the men's Poro society is in ses- sion, all activities connected with the Sande society are prohi- bited. As one would expect, given the spiritual status of the Zooba, it is not allowed at celebrations associated with Islam. In contrast, the nonspiritual status of the male masked dancers allows them to perform on Muslim religious occasions. The dance style of all Zooba maskers is similar. Further- more, the dance style of the Sande spirit impersonators among the Mende, Gola, and Dei is similar if not identical to that found among the Vai. For example, Little's description of the Mende Sowie's performance parallels the Vai Zooba's: "The style of the dance includes a darting and skipping movement taken almost at a run, like the preliminary stride of an expert skater on the rink. There are side to side inclinations of the head and shoulders-both turned in opposite directions and complicated pirouettes on the balls of the feet" (1951: 252). Despite the overall stylistic similarity among Zooba dancers, the choreographic complexity of individual performances is often astounding. The basically standardized and highly con- trolled training by the Sande society leaves ample room for the virtuosic skill of each dancer. When several Zooba maskers are present at an event, the stage is set for the performance of a competitive dance called maa timbb. Each dancer relies on Sande-made medicinal aids to enable her to surpass the others in artistry. The exhibition of mime, dramatic depictions of sex- ual activity, and intricate coordination of arm and foot move- ments are all a part of the masker's artistic repertoire. Female bystanders constantly shout words of praise, and spectators reward the masker with money. The gourd rattle sasaa is the traditional accompaniment to the Zooba dancer, although today it is quite common to see male musicians using plucked idiophones, drums, and slit- gongs as well. The sasaa has always been capable of transmit- ting signals to these dancers, but since male musicians have recently begun to accompany the Zooba, the Sande dancers have become better acquainted with the more complex phono-rhythmic speech surrogates traditionally used by men for Poro initiate dancers and masked dancers. A large number of songs in Vai, Mende,and Gola, along with prescribed in- strumental rhythms, exist in the Vai music repertoire solely for the accompaniment of Zooba dance performances. As a general rule, the Zooba and male masked dancers do not perform together. When both are present at an event, a dif- ferent part of the day is set aside for each one's performance. However, the Vai have recently begun to hold Christmas cele- brations where both male and female dancers appear. These celebrations are held in specially built enclosed areas, and ad- mission is charged. Their unconventional combined presence at a Christmas celebration in 1977 made for a display of extraordinary behavior. On this occasion there were three Zooba maskers and three male maskers-two Nafali and one K616kpo. The latter is not really a dancer but a jester or clown. This event made it clear that a performance by the Zooba does not consist entirely of dancing. One of the Zooba dancers seemed incensed with practically everything that occurred. Much of her anger was directed at the male participants: the masked dancers and the 58</page><page sequence="7">slit-gong player. She pranced about, stopped, stooped, and stared as if inquiring into everyone's affairs. Approaching the group of female chorus singers, she waved her cane over their heads. (A woman later said that the Zooba was displeased with the way the women were singing.) She then proceeded over to the male masked dancers, who were awaiting their turn to perform, and taunted them by striking her cane on the ground before them. Her irritation grew when the masker K616okp6 said in his typical growling voice, "Women devils (masked dancers) don't know how to dance," and "Hey, black devil, why can't you talk?" (Zooba dancers are not allowed to speak.) After an exchange of nonverbal expletives with the Kolo616kp6, the Zooba turned and quickly strutted away The slit- gong player was the next male to provoke her. Impatient with her antics, he signaled the Zooba to come and dance. She ap- proached him without responding to his call. He continued to transmit the dance signal, but she remained obstinate. Finally, after a prolonged standoff, the Zooba submitted, executing a series of dance movements. She then darted over to the male dancers to make one final pugnacious gesture and disap- peared into the zoo house. Performances like this one stimulate Vai audiences. As the dancers ridicule each other, women yell words of encourage- ment to the Zooba while men cheer on the K616kp6. Constant laughter and shouting are heard from both sides. The use of mime and other dramatic movements exhibits the Zooba's per- forming skills. Moreover, the less than hospitable exchanges between the Zooba and the male musician and dancers dramatize (or symbolize) the conflicts between men and women in everyday life. The future of the Zooba among the Vai is today uncertain. Muslim influences are becoming increasingly strong, and many Muslim Vai observers have openly declared a moratorium on the traditional version of Sande, within which the Zooba plays an integral role. The final dance form to be discussed here is performed by Sande members (sande musui-nu). A processional dance called ziawa takes place at the final ceremony of a Sande session. The procession, which begins in the bondo, is led by the Mazoo, the head matron of the society, and other key officials. Their white headties distinguish them from other Sande members. Several Zooba maskers dance alongside the main line of dancers. A great deal of pageantry is associated with the performance of ziawa, and all able-bodied Sande women are encouraged to participate. The women arrange themselves in a line, the upper body bent slightly forward and the arms held low. As the procession moves forward, a fairly quick shuffle move- ment is executed with the feet, and the arms are swayed from side to side, ideally in the direction opposite to that of the dancer immediately ahead. The opposite patterning accen- tuates the rhythmic flow of the women's dramatic entrance. Musical accompaniment to the dance is provided by the ken- gai and her assistants, all of them playing sasaa-nu. Sande members perform the dance as they sing responses to the ken- gai's solo line. Because of the pan-ethnic nature of Sande, the majority of ziawa songs used by the Vai are in the Mende lan- guage, and the body movements are the same as those found among the Gola, Dei, and in parts of Mende country. The procession meanders through the town for approxi- mately thirty minutes. After the dance has terminated in the town square, chiefs and elders, who have remained in the background throughout the duration of the ceremony, come forward to present money and gifts to the Sande officials and to express their gratitude to the women for completing a suc- cessful lodge. Ziawa is the only publicly performed dance that requires the full participation of Sande membership. Its movement pat- terns are less energetic than initiate and masked dancing and require no special training. However, ziawa fulfills a very im- portant need for all Sande women. As a group-oriented dance it instills a sense of solidarity and feminine identity among them. In a similar sense, it offers middle-aged and elderly women who are not involved in the day-to-day administration of the Sande an active role in the society's activities, thus strengthening the lifelong bond between the society and its members. The coordinated group movements of the dance re- flect the true role of the Sande as they mirror the cooperative spirit of women to confront and reconcile the problems of everyday life collectively. That ziawa is the dance performed at the final ceremony of a Sande session, when new members are welcomed into the Sande and at the same time admitted into Vai society as women, is therefore significant. Clearly, then, dance has an important role in the ceremonial and ritual activities of the Vai Sande society. Although the se- cretive nature of the institution and the attitudes of its mem- bers toward inquiries by men often hindered the acquisition of data on the role and meaning of dance at a subliminal level, it can be generally stated that dance also reaffirms the solidarity of women and serves as a symbolization of Sande values and beliefs. Judith Lynne Hanna wrote: "Human groups identify themselves and maintain their boundaries by various means. ... aesthetic expressions are often part of a culture's inven- tory of signs and demarcate and convey we/they social group- ings. Mental categories may be transformed into dance, signs of motional configurations, to transmit information about and for social interactions. Such signs may promote self-identity, prescribe and assert social values and roles and mediate be- tween persons and their situations .. ." (1979:83). Waterman shares this view, and further says: "All dance patterns have meaning. Sometimes they are codified, named, and assigned denotative meaning, but more often they communicate effect, directly and immediately, at a level different from language. Thus, humor, pathos, fear, and many other affective 'mes- sages' are transmitted by patterned bodily movement and re- ceived emphatically by the beholder" (1962: 49). Similarly, among the Vai, Sande dance involves communica- tion and the relationship between women and society, and more specifically between women and men. As we have seen, public dancing by the spirit impersonator Zooba, her mimetic gestures, her open conflict with men, and her control of medicines serve as a reminder to men of the power women hold during the three-year period Sande is in session. It is in this sense that Sande dance is a purely female activity. Moreover, activities involving dance transcend the reality of everyday life in that the normal division of labor and the economic and political aspects of life that have prescribed roles along sex lines are momentarily abandoned. In Sande dance such forms of communication range from the extremely subtle to the highly overt. Similar circumstances exist in other societies, for as Waterman has stated: "In addi- tion to explicit communication, it [dance] facilitates as does no other human activity the establishment of emphatic subliminal communication. Through continual and multi-faceted revali- dation and reaffirmation of the aesthetic, sacred, and social values held by the society, the dance serves as a force for social cohesion and as a means to achieve the cultural continuity without which the society could not persist" (1962: 50). It is in this light that Sande dance persists as an important element in the social consciousness of Vai women. O Notes, page 94 59</page><page sequence="8">MONTS, notes, from page 59 1.

Traditionally, the secret societies alternated sessions; the men and Poro were said to "own" the country for four years, and the women and Sande would "own" it for the next three years. In recent times, Poro activities have shar- ply declined, and women are allowed to initiate a Sande lodge at almost any time. 4. Like the Sande, the Poro traditionally engaged in the musical training of its initiates. But since Poro sessions have not been held in some Vai areas for over forty years, young boys no longer receive a formal musical training equal to that provided to girls by the Sande society. 5. During the absence of the kengai of the Sande lodge at Kobilya, a male slit-gong player rehearses the dance troupe. He and the Sande kai (a man appointed to handle affairs between the Sande and the town at large) are the only men allowed to enter the secluded Sande areas. 6. The Vai term tiimbo kI has a dual meaning: "to dance" and "to play." Thus, a male masked dancer is referred to as timbb ke feng, "plaything" (pl. tiimbl kt feng mbii-nu). 7. I have used the pronoun "her" in reference to the masked dancer, Zoba. I am, however, aware that some writers regard Zoba as a male spirit (see Johnson 1961: 2). Gender reference is not a controversial matter among the Vai, who constantly refer to Zoba as musu nyana (lit. "woman devil.") 8. According to Koelle (1854: 203), the Sande masked figure is not called Zoba but Nou, which he describes as "a masked woman in the sande ceremony, intended to repre- sent a demon or the devil." Biittikofer published the first sketched examples of the Sande masker as we know it today (1890, vol. 1: 254; vol. 2: 336). In addition, his vol- umes contain information on the role of the masker in Sande ceremonies. Ellis describes the aims and principles of the "gree gree bush" (a generic term for Sande) and mentions in some detail the costume design and role of "Zo-ba" in a Sande graduation ceremony (1914: 53-56). There is also an early twentieth-century photograph of Zo-ba (1914: 114). Additional photographs of the Vai Sande masker from this era may be found in Johnston (1906). 9. The medicine (boli) associated with Zooba may be car- ried on the dancer as an amulet and be used to enhance the dancer's performing ability. Other Sande medicines for so- cial control are symbolically represented by Zooba in non- dance situations. For example, Zooba's presence during litigations reminds men of powerful Sande medicines when violations of traditional law occur against women, or when men are accused of violating Sande laws. 10. For an excellent discussion of Sande rituals, see Holsoe 1980: 97-111. 11. Holsoe reports a recent case where a Zooba dancer stumbled during a performance and was forced to seek re- fuge in a neighboring chiefdom for three years (1980: 106).
