<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEOLOGY From Earthquake, Fire and Flood. By R. Hewitt. [Pp. 216, with 15 plates.] (London : G. Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., 1957. 18s. net.) Within the appropriately lurid dust-cover of this notable volume the author has assembled a wealth of fascinating detail on those more humbling ex- periences of man's encounter with his natural environment, and animated it with a magnificent collection of 29 photographs. It is a book for those inquisitive souls who would have the worst of the inescapable background of their daily lives dispassionately revealed to them within the compass of a few hours spent in the comfort of their own armchairs - and who are prepared for the author's erratic style to jerk them from their complacency as he leads the reader with informed comparison from some bygone distant catastrophe to yesteryear's disaster in the next county. Ranging from the sluggish, inexorable climatic changes of remote aeons to the capricious dart of the thunderbolt, consideration is given to the larger meteoric calamities, epidemics and death by fire and famine due to drought or pest. However, by far the greatest parts are devoted to earthquake and volcanic activity manifesting the earth's internal unrest and those afflictions of its skin seen as hurricanes, gales and floods. Such anthropomorphic behaviour has inevitably aroused the superstitious, and the text is occasion- ally enlivened by such tales of the ancients. Most appropriately the volume concludes with a warning to man who, through his own ignorance and folly, would vie with nature in his own undoing through deforestation, over-crop- ping, atmospheric pollution and war. The more informed reader may perhaps notice the author's rare scientific deviations, when he is guilty of propagating popular misconceptions or misleading implications, and be some- what disappointed in the paucity of the promised scientific treatment. The novice, however, will find the appendices, glossary, bibliography and index most stimulating and useful in an assured continuing investigation which should be the author's reward. F.
