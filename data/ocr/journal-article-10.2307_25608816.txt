As is well known, the discoveries of Pompeii and Herculaneum in the mid-eighteenth century provided one bookend for neoclassicism while the Aegina marbles, brought to Munich in 1818 after being restored by Thorvaldsen in Rome and exhibited in Leo von Klenze's Glyptothek from 1830 onward provided the other.1 This was certainly no new modern development in cause and effect, for the whole Renaissance was a response to the fragments of ancient literary and material culture that eager humanists and antiquarians turned up. The discovery of the House of Nero (domus aurea) in sixteenth-century Rome inspired a generation of Renaissance painters and architects?Raphael, Giulio Romano, and many others?in developing the maniera alia grottesca just as much as the Napoleonic campaigns in North Africa led to the archaeological ly driven empire style of Percier and Fontaine. Just as often these finds also caused significant debates. Such was the case of the discovery that the ancient temples were painted in vivid colors, which became a cause celebre in the later nineteenth century. A generation of young architects in France (most notably Vaudoyer, Duban, and Due) was profoundly affected as was Gottfried Semper in Germany. Indeed, Semper embarked upon writing his momentous treatise Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Kunsten (1860 1862) as a direct result of this new conception of surface treatment in ancient architecture.2 The list of such interactions is long. A particularly spectacular case was the effect of the physical lifting of the Hellenistic Pergamon altar from Turkey in 1879 and its parachuting into post-unification Berlin. Paradoxically, where the discovery led in terms of the arts, especially architecture, has attracted less attention than its more famous, earlier counterparts. To be sure, by the later nineteenth century, such large-scale plundering and lifting of artifacts was a relatively common procedure. As empires grew, and as industry and economic power expanded commensurately, so did the desire to transform national museums into temples of learning to showcase the imperial cultural attainments. In this respect, the German drive to acquire the identity of Kulturnation is a well-established example, but it was certainly not alone. As Theodor Mommsen, the doyen of German Romanists, noted in 1890, to the contemporary phenomenon of Grosstadt (big city) and Grosswirtschaft ("big" industry) also belonged Grosswissenschaft (big scholarship).3 The museum as institution was the natural recipient of this growth, and as it developed so did the scale and number of its exhibits. But even in this company, the arrival of the Pergamon altar was a significant event (fig. 1). And even followed as it was by the Orientforschung spolia, the Babylonian Ishtar Gate (packed into 600 crates in 1902 but not completely installed until 1934), the Mschatta Gate (transported in 422 crates in 1904), and the Miletus Market Gate (1908-1909), the Pergamon altar remained a unique commotion.4 The fact that it presented an This article is based on the paper I delivered at the conference "Rethinking the Baroque/'York University, July 1-3, 2006, and at the Max Planck Gesellschaft Annual Meeting, Frankfurt, July 16, 2006.

Where earlier, in the cases previously cited, an architectural, a figural, and/or a decorative art style was propelled by the arrival of new and startling visual stimuli, in the case of the Pergamon altar one of its most lasting effects (outside of its own discipline of archaeology and ancient art), I would argue, was upon the history of art itself, in areas ostensibly far removed from the Greco-Roman world. To be sure, its reception also dovetailed into the development of a new style?the neo-Baroque?though in more complex ways than solely for political reasons as has been argued so far. More specifically, the confrontation with the Pergamon marbles had a lasting effect on the concept of stylistic change (Stilwandlung) and on that of the relationship among media? architecture, sculpture, and painting?that it threw into crisis. In sum, I would like to argue that it acted as a "problem object" that precipitated debate, reevaluations, and indeed a mise en abfme of received values, and that it is precisely the fact of its being lifted out of its own context, its alienation, its portability and dramatic burst upon the stage of a developing discipline like a comet or meteorite that allowed it to function in this way. 1.

According to Alexander Conze, a three-column section of the upper colonnade was transported and erected in Berlin; Ludwig von Ulrichs is even more specific and states that of the 462 cases sent to Berlin, half were sculpture while the other half inscriptions and which this is a prime example, has been admirably told by Suzanne Marchand; and she points out the internal competitions between rival sites, most notably, in this case, between Olympia (excavated by Ernst Curtius) and Pergamon (excavated by Carl Humann). While Curtius could not bring the findings home (because of Greek legislation) Humann could, as the German museums had worked out a transaction with the help of the Porte and diplomatic go-betweens, so of the two very large and important concomitant digs only the latter could ignite the imagination back home.7 The contrast between the two archaeological finds could not be greater?one "early" classical, the other Hellenistic; one confirming the received aesthetic of the Greek Winckelmannian ideal, the other literally turning it upside down, arising from a completely different sensibility, and yet of an aesthetic quality that could not be denied (figs. 2 and 3). The shock effect was tremendous among scholars, indeed the entire art world. Both Ivan Turgenev and Jacob Burckhardt responded with equal amazement to a sight of the marbles when they were first revealed to the public.8 "At the sight of these irrepressibly fine wonders, what becomes of all our accepted ideas about Greek sculpture, its severity, serenity, about its confinement within borders of its particular art, of its classicism?all those ideas that have been inculcated on us as indubitable truths by our instructors, theoreticians, aesthetes, by the whole of our training and scholarship?"

In his 1897 long Nekrolog article on Curtius's life, Adolf Michaelis, professor at Strasburg and member of the DAI (Deutsches Archaeologisches Institut) confirmed the effect from the perspective of a fellow archaeologist. He noted that the public responded more readily to the "Barock" language of the Pergamon marbles than to the late archaic sculptures of the temple of Zeus. Indeed, he added, some perceived the Pergamon altar to be a climax of Greek art and conversely felt that the Olympia excavations had been a disappointment.11 Burckhardt also found them so, and significantly beneath the artistic value of the Aegina marbles.12 Humann himself was well aware of the significance of his find and voiced what would become general opinion when he wrote to Alexander Conze, then director of the antiquities collections of the Berlin museums (and from 1881 secretary of the powerful DAI) in September 12, 1878: "We have not found a dozen reliefs, but a whole artistic period that lay buried and forgotten!"13 Indeed, in a few discovery has thrown the archaeologists' system into confusion!

A cluster of publications that escalated to the level of a serious . debate followed closely on the heels of the marbles' arrival. The archaeologist Alexander Conze published "Uber das Relief der Griechen" (1882); Heinrich von Brunn, the article "Uber die kunstgeschichtliche Stellung der Pergamenischen Gigantomachie" (1884); and a response to both came from Guido Hauck, (rector of theTechnische Hochschule in Berlin) in his lecture delivered (and published) "Die Grenzen zwischen Malerei und Plastik und die Gesetze des Reliefs" as an anniversary address to celebrate the Kaiser's birthday on March 31,1885. These publications dealt with the art-theoretical implications of the Pergamon finds and as such resonated beyond the archaeological field. They represent, of course, only the exalted tip of an iceberg, as literature about the Pergamon altar proliferated and reached even to the popular level of the guidebook. In the ancient field, it was immediately processed into Julius Overbeck's second edition of his history of Greek sculpture, and he gave the marbles an unqualified enthusiastic reception.17 But perhaps the most famous response was Adolf von Hildebrandt's Das Problem der Form (1893)?a reading of sculpture (admittedly, without direct references to the Gigantomachy) that moved in and out of apperception and pure visibility while exalting the relief as the supreme manifestation of artistic vision.18 Ostensibly the debate was about how this work ought to be integrated into the canon. A significant find, and securely dated, it became a reference point to locate other, less well documented art and refine the current view of the stylistic unfolding of ancient sculpture. Where did the Laocoon fit, famously the prime example of Hellenistic art? What did it mean for Roman imperial art? But although dating attracted much attention, what was actually at stake was the definition of a style: what constitutes apogee, what constitutes decline, and what are its features. In short, the mechanics of style change (Sti I wand lung). And guiding the discussions that unfolded were the concepts and themes of painterliness (malerisch), mixed media, naturalism versus idealism, pathos versus ethos, and of the nature of artistic decline. One of the main issues that scholars were facing? and that Turgenev had picked up on right away?was the mixed-media effect of the altar. It was painterly, though a work of sculpture; and yet not an independent sculptural group either, but rather the foundation or podium of an architectural ensemble. Much of the debate revolved around the location of the Pergamon sculptural frieze among the three traditional media: painting, sculpture, and architecture. Clearly, painting 14.

In the popular imagination, Schliemann was erroneously associated with Pergamon, so great was his reputation in Germany and the desire to connect the two: a great find with a great finder. Schliemann's excavation of Troy preceded somewhat Pergamon (started in 1871, published in 1874), while his Mycenae excavation and the recuperation of the gold (so-called Agamemnon) mask occurred in 1876-1878; the Troy excavation was reopened in 1878-1879 and was continued by Rudolf Virchow and Wilhelm Dorpfeld.

Hildebrand came up with the concept of the "malerisches Relief in his Das Problem der Form (1893), where he merged painting, sculpture, and architecture and defined "Plastik" (sculpture) as the "Belebung der Flache" (animation of the plane). He began writing the essay in 1876 and started sending drafts to Fiedler in 1881. As such, the conception of the work, though influenced by Fiedler, was also contemporary with the arrival of the Pergamon marbles at Berlin, and another famous response to them.

In his essay of 1882, Conze reviewed the attitudes to the "malerischer Relief' and noted that scholars contemptuous of Zopf (a pejorative term for German Baroque-cum-Rococo) also dismissed the painterly relief.19 What seemed self-evident to him was that malerisch and Baroque (decadent) art were synonymous. Indeed, in 1855, in his Der Cicerone, Burckhardt had moaned deeply at the decadent slipping of sculpture away from Plastik and into painterliness when he was evaluating Bernini's work.20 The arrival of the altar then allowed Conze to strike a blow at this prejudice. The main point of his essay was to demonstrate: (a) that the painterly relief had been invented by the Greeks, and thus was not a degenerated form introduced by the Romans (whose artistic merit he also wished to resurrect); and (b) that for the Greeks painting and relief were not separated, but were coextensive and that one can speak of relief-like Greek painting, as one can speak of a painterly relief.21 Indeed, he insisted that the relief may be understood as a special form of painting. In one fell swoop, Conze rehabilitated Zopf by rehabilitating its defining feature? painterliness?when he attached it to the find of the century. The malerisch quality of the relief also finally put to rest the opposition between ancient and modern work, he concluded, by proving that ancient sculpture also had a painterly period, and the frequent comparisons with Michelangelo and Andreas Schluter that had been made, he continued, amply proved the point.22 Of course, this did not settle the problem. The perennial issue of media specificity?a mainstay of art criticism since the eighteenth century?continued to . be invoked by others. It was a commonplace in the field to place those works of art on a pinnacle that used the characteristic features of their medium to reach perfection, and only those. And in 1883-1884 Adolf Trendelenburg in his "Die Laokoongruppe und der Gigantenfries des pergamenischen Altars" (a lecture delivered in November 1883 and again on March 4, 1884, at the German Archaeological Institute and published later that month) drew on similar arguments to review once again the relative merits of the frieze and the Laocoon (figs. 4 and 5).23 Once other scholars had raised the thorny problem of influence, the dating of the two sculpture ensembles had become tightly connected to their relative value. And refereeing among them was the problem that Trendelenburg had set himself. Reinhard Kekule von Stradonitz and Adrien Wagnon (professor at the University of Geneva) had placed the Pergamon marbles before the Laocoon; moreover, they had argued for the latter's direct dependence on the frieze, while Overbeck had referred the issue to Conze in his authoritative tomes on Greek sculpture.24 For Trendelenburg, like for so many, the issue was a vital one: By showing the Laocoon ("Michelangelo's wonder of art") to be derivative, it had been cast into a secondary work of art and essentially gutted of value.25 In redating the Laocoon so as to place it before the frieze and reassert its importance, he too restated the painting/sculpture paragone that his contemporaries had claimed to be the defining feature of the frieze. Thus, he too noted the overlaps with painting?indeed, the competition between sculpture and its sister art?as the overwhelming stylistic novelty at work. However, for Trendelenburg, sculpture lost this contest, and the palm went to the Laocoon as being closer in spirit to the sculpture of the classical period. As far as he was concerned, he argued, the frieze could be praised as much as one wished, but no one could claim that its overcrowded composition, with its figures cutting across each other, its foreshortenings and perspectival bravura, could be the least bit inspired by "the spirit of sculpture" 19.

In the same year, Heinrich von Brunn, professor at Munich, also took up the issue in a monumental sixty page essay on the Pergamon marbles (shortly thereafter to be published as a book), and he berated Conze and others for looking for malerisch qualities in the frieze.27 Like Trendelenburg, he wanted to retain the importance of the Laocoon group for Hellenistic art against the rising fame of the Pergamon frieze. Conze was once again his target (and to a certain degree also Kekule), and he reminded his readers that the latter had placed the frieze at the very center of Hellenistic art (of the Diadochi period)?indeed, had placed the frieze before the Laocoon?and given it priority in the invention of motifs.28 However, dating and attribution were not his tools and he turned to close formal analysis to make 26.

Unable to deny its importance, he sought to assign the Pergamon frieze a separate category?rather than painterly, he saw it as "tectonic-decorative," that is, a compositional element of a larger architectural whole (fig. 6). For him?and to make his point Brunn used a drawing of the altar seen from a great distance?the frieze read like a (decorative) carpet and its function was to explain the forces of statics at work in the architectural superstructure (whose foundation or podium it was after all) by way of the violently interlocking bodies. As such, he concluded, the frieze was an element of the overall architecture and did not belong to sculpture.29 Brunn offered thus a reading of the ensemble based on empathy theory (Einfuhlung) but without naming it in so many words: He cited Gottfried Semper (from 29. "Die pergamenische Ara steht nicht im Mittelpunkte der Kunst der Diadochenzeit im Allgemeinen, sondern der Kunst im Anfange des zweiten Jahrhunderts und kann also keine ruckwertige Kraft haben fiir die Beurteilung der Kunst des dritten, um so weniger als ihre architektonisch dekorativen Reliefs einer ganz anderen Kunstgattung angehdren, als die statuarische Werke des dritten."

Overbeck had been careful to avoid the whole issue: According to him, the Pergamon marbles had retained the true spirit of Greek relief.35 Unlike him, Hauck took the bull by the horns and attacked Conze and those who upheld his view. As he charted the trajectory of the painterly relief from here, he saw the line of development leading to the reliefs of the Roman triumphal arches, and he pointed to the Renaissance as its ultimate heir: Ghiberti introduced perspective into the relief and it is from here that painting took it over. This was the ultimate blending (not to say confusion) of painterliness and relief, which was not "saved" until Thorwaldsen, his contemporary hero, forsook the painterly staging for reliefs and returned the medium to its (pure) origins.36 Thus, Hauck clearly testified to the fascination with the relief and its malerisch qualities that the Pergamon Gigantomachy caused even as he struck out in a different direction with his own reading. Indeed, in words that recalled Conze and anticipated Heinrich Wolfflin, he concluded: "We can speak about a relief conception in ancient painting just as much as we can speak of a painterly treatment of the relief."37 If malerisch was a recurrent bone of contention, the other issue that the Pergamon altar precipitated was the need for the scholarly community to revise or at least face up to one of its central prejudices: in favor of idealism and against naturalism. The Winckelmannian ideal of noble simplicity and quiet grandeur ("edle Einfalt und stille Grosse") did not allow for strong, realistic emotions or gestures (fig. 7). This dialectic was accompanied by a value judgment that inevitably favored the restrained and idealized work of the fifth century B.C.?that is, of Phidias and his school (fig. 8). This bias had been also telescoped onto later periods and had set the Renaissance against the Baroque. Alongside the idealism/naturalism opposition ran the prejudice in favor of ethos over pathos. In German art historical texts, these terms strayed somewhat from their Aristotelian origins and were used instead to denote contained and/or latent emotions rather than fully enacted (natural) ones.38 Thus, the two sets of oppositions were in fact connected and reinforced each other. All scholars weighed in on this issue. Brunn, for example, argued that naturalistic detail ("superficialities") often affected viewers more than they realized, as if to suggest a cheaper trick to draw the spectator in.39 Throughout, when dealing with the naturalism of the Pergamon altar, his vocabulary shifted to a light pejorative: The representation was that of superficial appearances of surfaces; the competition with reality pushed to illusionism; imitation of nature replaced free, ideal re-creation; the artist sought to exceed nature, and so on.40 And to drive his point home, Brunn insisted that he missed the pathos that arose from ethos, as was the case for the Laocoon. In his view, the dramatic pathos of the Pergamon altar frieze was not the real purpose of the work; instead, it had become a means to display virtuosity, as was the case in epideictic rhetoric, and, in the end, it succeeded in being (merely?) decorative.41 Likewise, looking toward the negative implications of naturalism, Trendelenburg noted that all art historians had declared the striking realism of the frieze to be the last (and late) development phase of Greek art; hence he felt justified in dating the Laocoon earlier for its more idealized (read superior) conception of form.42 Alone, Conze did not allow prejudice to cloud his reading: Although he also noted the naturalism of the frieze, he insisted that this "frightening naturalism" 33.

The rise of Baroque studies What is clear from the debates surrounding the Pergamon altar is that the categories invoked? malerisch, media overlap, naturalism, stylistic changes? plucked chords that resonated across the discipline of art history. Most importantly, the "ancients" had set a pattern by their frequent comparisons between the Pergamon frieze and "modern" art that ranged from late Renaissance to Baroque. Clearly, such comments had arisen from the first reactions of the art world?makers and critics?but the academics took them on. Conze compared the reliefs with the work of Michelangelo (whose late style was considered at the time to mark the beginning of the Baroque) and Schluter; Ludwig von Ulrichs compared them with Rubens and Wagner; while 43. ".. .voll ... schrecklicher Naturlichkeit und doch in einem grossen Stile." Conze, Pergamon (see note 6), p. 13. Overbeck had also noted what he called the "realism" of the reliefs and saw it in conjunction with the emotional content as the features that later artists picked up from the Pergamon school. Overbeck, Geschichte (see note 17), p. 230. 44. Conze recalls how such outstanding works as the Nike of Samothrace or Venus of Milo had presented problems for scholars: They seemed of too high a quality to be assigned to a late date. "Es verschwindet dabei die zu niedrige Vorstellung von einer Zeit des Verfalls, in der man bis vor kurzem?ich errinere an die samothrakische Nike?sich scheute treffliche Werke enstanden zu denken." Ibid. He reiterates this position in Alexander Conze, "Review of J. Overbeck Geschichte der griechischen Plastik (1882)," Gottingische gelehrete Anzeigen, vol. 2, 1882, pp. 897-914. Although Conze takes issue with Overbeck, the latter had been only modestly prejudiced when he stated that the reliefs showed an "unexpectedly" high level of artistic conscientiousness (Kunstlerische Gewissenhaftigkeit) for this late date.

Hinrich, 1882), vol. 2. Overbeck associated the Parthenon reliefs with Mozart and Raphael and Pergamon with Rubens and modern orchestral works. Even Burckhardt engaged in this game of analogies when he proposed Rubens as a meaningful later counterpart.45 Without stepping outside of his field, Brunn also used the parallel with the Baroque when he quoted his own argument in Geschichte der griechischen Kunstler (1857-1859) in which he described the art of the Diadochi (as it was known up until then) as (mercifully, he implies) free of willful mannerisms and baroque excessive fantasy ("barocke Phantasterei"), thus connecting once again the Pergamon altar with evaluations of the Baroque.46 But earlier art historical evaluations outside of ancient scholarship and Winckelmannian aesthetics also weighed on these readings and provided a critical position and vocabulary that the ancient scholars could seize upon. Burckhardt's Der Cicerone (1855) was one such well-known work that transcended periods and scholarly divides and provided a background for formal evaluations of art from antiquity to "modern" times. Thus, in architecture, Burkhardt had defined malerisch to be the essence (Grundgefuhl) of the Baroque style (1580-1780),47 a "questionable style" that he was almost apologetic for introducing to his readers, and he excused his attempt on the grounds of comprehensiveness.48 Indeed, the term came up in connection with architecture time and time again, associated with restlessness49 and movement,50 but particularly with "a strong relief and therefore powerful 45. On Burckhardt's analogies, see von Salis, Burckhardts Vorlesungen (note 12), p. 20-21. The tradition of reading Michelangelo's late style as Baroque reached August Schmarsow who reiterated it in his Zur Frage nach dem Malerischen (Leipzig: S. Hirzel, 1896).

Thus, he names Konrad Zacher (Beilage zur Allgemeinen Zeitung, 1880) and Bernhard Forster {Literarische Beilage der Karlsruher Zeitung, 1880) who published immediately upon the first showing of the Pergamon marbles; and among later publications, he lists Ludwig von Sybel {Weltgeschichte der Kunst, 1888); Maxime Collignon {Pergame; Restauration et description des monuments de Yacropole, 1900); Walther Amelung (Romische Mitteilungen, 1903); and Reinhard Kekule von Stadonitz (Die griechische Skulptur, 1906).

There, too, Burckhardt identified a turn towards painterliness, naturalism, and excessive affect at all costs.53 Bernini was his bete noire: His overly polished marbles, overdeveloped male musculature, spongy female bodies, and fluttering drapery that described the movements of the soul instead of the body led Burkhardt to evaluate this style as sad and even repulsive.54 All these features were imported from painting, he concluded, leaving the plastic composition beyond redemption.55 In his narrative, the finale of this malerisch destruction of sculpture was the altar group (chief among them Bernini's Ecstasy of St. Theresa and the Cathedra Petri), whose painterly composition sacrificed all laws of sculpture (fig. 9).56 And with withering scorn he concluded that Bernini might as well have drawn the consequences of his push towards ever more naturalism and included color in his sculpture.57 The similarity of Burckhardt's vocabulary to describe the Baroque to that employed by Conze, Brunn, or Trendelenburg to describe the Pergamon marbles is unmistakable. And yet, despite the prejudices attached to the Baroque with which this vocabulary was replete?witness Burckhardt?the popularity of the Pergamon marbles turned the tide toward curiosity and interest.58 This fertile soil for revisiting a style that had been on the index for some time in contemporary architecture apparently bore instant fruit in the field of art history. The 1880s and 1890s mark almost an explosion of studies of the Baroque, whether German or Italian. Among the first were Robert Dohme's Die Geschichte der deutschen Baukunst (1886), in which the author spent a sizeable part of the book on the Baroque, and his later Barock und Rokoko Architektur Figure 9.

Even a cursory glance at these tomes shows the vocabulary to be familiar. For example, in 1886, the terms that Dohme uses to describe Baroque architecture are so repetitive as to be striking. On one page alone he uses the term malerisch nine times to describe the nature of the Baroque; in association with this term, he highlights the relief and figural sculpture (three times); he returns to the effects of light and shade ("the magic play of light and shadow" as he puts it) four times; and he draws attention to the animation (Belebung is his word) of the 51.

Since the publication of Der Cicerone, Burckhaidt had been slowly changing his views on the Baroque?at least on the architecture. However, this is evident in private correspondence and his readers were still working with his Cicerone views. In his letter of April 5, 1875, he writes to Alioth: "Mein Respekt vor dem Barocco nimmt stundlich zu und ich bin bald geneigt, ihn fiir das eigentliche Ende und Hauptresultat der lebedigen Architektur zu halten. Er hat nicht nur Mittel fiir'al les, was zum Zweck dient, sondern auch fiir den schonen Schein."

But at the level of formal analysis, some form of a consensus in reading baroque forms seems to have been reached here. Recalling Burckhardt, these authors also showed that they had read him across the literature surrounding the Pergamon marbles. Indeed, Michaelis's observation that the public response (rather than the scholarly one) to the recent excavations was clearly favoring the Baroque (read Pergamon) over the late archaic (read Olympia) also deserves some attention! Which came first: the interest in the Baroque and as result the interest in Pergamon, or the altar that produced an aesthetic revolution and rehabilitated a neo-Baroque sensibility and style? This may seem something of a chicken-and-egg question, but deserves unpacking if only to lay out the landscape against which the art historical debates were set. On the one hand, it is true that Humann had sent to Berlin 59. Robert Dohme, Geschichte der deutschen Baukunst (Berlin: G.

Photo: Adoc-photos/Art Resource, N.Y. two reliefs in 1872 (and showed them to Ernst Curtius in 1871), but they languished in storage until Conze was named director of the antiquities collections of the Berlin museums in 1877 and became interested.60 Evidently, in 1871 the German archaeological world was not yet ready for them. Yet, on the other hand, the rise of a baroque sensibility certainly predated the arrival of the Pergamon marbles. Buildings such as the Paris Opera House (inaugurated in 1875) and the Great Exhibition pavilions springing up in various European capitals and well-known to visitors and the architectural media alike testify to this swing in taste (fig. 11). Moreover, by the 1870s, the debate about the "right style" for the century that was a commonplace among architects across Europe had become more focused in Germany and the issue of a national style took center stage. Although the Gothic Revival had held sway for some time, it was now being supplanted by neo-Renaissance, neo-Romanesque, and neo-Baroque alternatives. The debates around the style of the Reichstag?clearly seen as a major statement for being the German post-unification parliament building?document these swings and their respective justifications.61 At the end of a process that lasted from 1872 to 1882, Paul Wallot won the competition with a richly sculpted late-Renaissance or (incipient) neo-Baroque building.62 Indeed, like Semper's heavily 60.

Humann states that the first he heard back from Berlin about an interest in Pergamon was on December 7, 1877, when Conze first wrote to him; this was followed by an interest in carrying out excavations, which Conze first expressed in his letter of February 26, 1878 (ibid., p. 449). Although Curtius was not moved to excavate Pergamon, he did include the plan of the site developed by Humann in his Beitragen zur Topographie Kleinasiens and ensured that he was named member of the German Archaeological Institute.

Inevitably, these revivals also generated interest in the respective styles and periods themselves, so a scholarly-cum-archaeological effort accompanied the Greek, Roman, Gothic, Renaissance, and other revivals. As a neo-Baroque also emerged, so did an aesthetic sensibility that favored its historical model. From a decadent architecture, pejoratively referred to as Zopf by the Schinkel school, the Baroque became a genuine and viable alternative, a perfect choice for a large public building?a hotel, a casino, an opera house, a palace, a theater.63 There was one other major driving force behind the shift of taste and interest toward the Baroque in architecture: New building types, generally intended for large groups of people (be they national libraries or train stations) that became possible and affordable as the result of technological developments (iron and steel trusses, for example) provided the impetus toward the exploration of large scale and its architectural treatment. As representational spaces for competing empires?be they British, Austrian, Ottoman, or just emerging as such (like the German or the Italian), they traded in grandeur, splendor, scale, and effect and were part of a social/ political/economic mise en scene particular to the late nineteenth century. Perhaps the most representative buildings?iconically at least?of this new globalized, competing, industrialized world, increasingly polarized around a few "imperial" centers, was the great exhibition pavilion, representing its nation and seeking to produce the greatest impact while containing the most people.64 While Paxton's Crystal Palace did not trade in baroque monumentality, subsequent efforts?in Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, and elsewhere?turned to its formal language as a visual referent. But other aspects also played into the popular reception in favor of the Baroque that Michaelis notes, and, once again, concerns the Pergamon marbles. No matter how well-primed the taste toward the Baroque might have been, it was latently so. It needed the shock effect that captured the attention and imagination and that the Pergamon marbles delivered. Indeed, what "7. y&amp;" UK-mix . .::): :^;lMiWB^^^^^^?^^Kx\^fe^i^^^^Ek'l^MMBM Figure 12. Neues Schauspielhaus, Friedrich von Schinkel, 1818-1821. Berlin.

The effect was that much greater as it hit at the heart of the community that lived the Winckelmann classical ideal. Although Berlin and its neighbor Dresden were notable for exemplary Zopf architecture, the spare Prussian classicism of Schinkel had formed the taste of several generations of architects as well as that of the archaeologists (fig. 12). Overlaps between the architectural and archaeological communities were common, and many were active in both fields. Although Carl Botticher, one of the stalwart supporters of the 63.

Indeed, some of the most renowned excavators?Wilhelm Dorpfeld, Carl Humann, Alois Hauser, Richard Bohn?were trained as architects. And the prevailing taste among architects filtered through to the archaeologists. According to Michael is, Ernst Curtius, the excavator of Olympia, was profoundly influenced by Botticher and Schinkel until the end of his life. This is especially evident in his public lecture given in 1853 at the Berlin Architects7 Union (Architektenverein) for the annual celebration of Friedrich von Schinkel, otherwise known as the Schinkelfest.65 3. Malerisch, Korpergefuhl, and the plastic reading of architecture As we have seen, the archaeologists' debates unfolded on lines familiar to both architects and art historians and as such found significant echoes in the literature of the period. It is also clear that the influence worked both ways. However, among the consequences of the Pergamon discovery and the debates it engendered for the field of art history as a whole, its effect upon the work of Heinrich Wolfflin is perhaps the most dramatic. His was the most lasting contribution that emerged from this moment of intensity as well as the one that drew real methodological innovations out of the Pergamon debates. That Wolfflin was familiar with the debates is evident. Not only was the prominence of the principal actors such that the scholarly world would take notice (especially a young doctoral student as he was at the time), but Brunn was Wolfflin's much-admired teacher during his study years in Munich between 1882 and 1886 (when he submitted his dissertation Prologomena zu einer Psychologie der Architektur) and it was still to him that he dedicated Renaissance und Barock, his Habilitationsschrif of 1888.66 Even more significant is that Wolfflin cites von Brunn's Pergamon article in the Prologomena in a very critical passage (in a work moreover, where his citations are few and far between, and none other from art history). This sole art historical reference?together with one mention of Gottfried Semper's Der Stil?belies the importance it had for his argument. As is well known, in the Prolegomena (1886), Wolfflin turns to the nascent discipline of psychology to understand the mechanisms at work in the reception of art?his specific case being architecture. And he is normally read as deriving much of his thinking from the sources he lists?Wundt, Helmholtz, Volkelt, Vischer, Lotze, Fechner? that is, the whole optics, psychology and empathy literature that moved at the intersection between aesthetics and science, while the art historical context is largely forgotten (with the exception of Burckhardt).67 Semper (who claimed to be writing as an art historian) and even more so Brunn (who was so focused on close reading and formal analysis and leaned on Semper himself) were his very immediate, discipline specific sources.68 In short, empathy theory came mediated to Wolfflin and this mediation left its traces both in his method and in his questions. For example, in his analysis of the Pergamon reliefs, Brunn looks at a host of "peripheral" elements (following Semper's method) before he gets to the bodies themselves: He looks at shoes, drapery, animal skin, hair, feathers, wings, and scales. For Wolfflin, from his very first publication, the primary clues to a style or a style change would be those located on the margins: in objects of daily use, in clothes (the famous Gothic shoe), in the detail that announces and precedes the larger gestures in the monumental arts.69 Both Semper and von Brunn had shown him the way.70 65.

On this topic see Alina Payne, Modern Architecture and the Rise of a Theory of Objects (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="19">186 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 But perhaps most important was Brunn's reading of the Pergamon altar base as a carpet of bodies that enact and represent the effects of the load it carried. This interpretation had a significant resonance in Wolfflin's work that went far beyond that of the psychologists he was quoting, for it showed how psychology of perception could be applied to the formal analysis of a work of art. Indeed, Wolfflin is quite candid about this origin of his thinking, and he cites enthusiastically the striking connection between architecture and sculptural composition in the Pergamon altar as proposed by Brunn.71 Moreover, this citation occurs at a key moment in the Prologomena, in connection with his reading of the pedimental figures in a Greek temple, "which, relieved from weight, can move freely."72 This is the climax of his argument?and its most visually compelling part?and an essential part of his reading of ornament as expression of "excessive force to form," which concludes his analysis of architecture.73 Although Semper had been the one to establish such an empathy based analysis of form, Wolfflin's most immediate source that applied the method to traditional art historical work?dating, establishing influence, evaluating artistic worth?remained Brunn, and his test case Pergamon. From this general evaluation of architecture in 1888, Wolfflin turned to a sustained analysis of the Baroque. What moved him to write Renaissance und Barock was ostensibly his desire to understand another mechanism? this time the mechanism of stylistic change. "What happened to the Renaissance? Why did the Renaissance end?" were his questions.74 Once again, he cited Brunn and Kekule as well as Conze's article on the relief? indeed, most of the main protagonists of the Pergamon debate.75 But perhaps the most telling statement is to be found in his preface: "For now, I had to abandon the plan for a parallel presentation of the ancient Baroque. It would have been too much of a burden for this little book. However, I hope to present this remarkable comparison elsewhere soon."76 And, taking this argument even further, and much like the scholars writing on the Pergamon marbles, Wolfflin also compares the Baroque with his own time, specifically with Wagner.77 Clearly, when he turned to his book, the Pergamon marbles were on his mind for a number of reasons but also because there was one further issue that their arrival had put on the map. The problem of style change (Stil wand lung) in Greek art that the newly discovered marbles had precipitated made the issue even more topical than it already was. Trendelenburg, Conze, and Brunn were battling the same problem as Wolfflin: How to bring some stylistic order to the visual material of antiquity and on what criteria to base it. In the modern period, where Wolfflin's work was located, dating was not so much the issue as it was for his archaeologist colleagues, but stylistic transformation was. In contemporary architecture, the famous "Battle of Styles" had provoked many a discussion on what the appropriate style for the period might be and added considerable fuel to the art historical fire. However, the mechanism of stylistic change had not been broached as such and it was the Pergamon debates that really brought this issue into the foreground. Of course, the impetus to understand stylistic change was also tied to the needs of Renaissance scholarship. In a period when the Renaissance was garnering much attention both as a building Style among architects and as a historical model that validated the alliance between patron and artist, power and art (as laid out by Burckhardt in Kultur der Renaissance in Italien), understanding what exactly the Renaissance was, sharpening its contours and hence its definition had become something of a priority.78 The days were quickly fading of its secondary place to the main subject of antiquity that had prompted the Zurich Eidenossische Technische Hochschule to appoint Burckhardt against opposition and "despite" the fact that he was no ancient scholar.79 In this new climate, refining definitions became increasingly urgent. 71.

Renaissance und Barock is about the transition from one style to another in architecture as his test case and the beginning of a sustained reflection on this topic. To be sure, it was a direct response to both Cornelius Gurlitt's recent book on the Baroque, and to Adolf Goller who had posited form fatigue ("Ermudung des Formgefuhls") as the cause of stylistic changes.80 In a way, it was also a response to Burckhardt, as Wolfflin himself acknowledged toward the end of his life: For him, Burckhardt had never defined the essence of the Renaissance style.81 But more followed. In Klassische Kunst (1899), he sought the transition (or Stilwandlung) from early Renaissance to High Renaissance in painting; in Die Kunst Albrecht Durer's (1905)?the transition from Gothic to Renaissance; finally, in Crundbegriffe (1915), he pulled together Klassische Kunst and Renaissance und Barock into one book that looks at all the media as they transition from Renaissance to Baroque, or in his words "follows step by step the development of modern seeing."82 The influences on his work were many and his reference pool large, but the initial impetus had come from the visibility and the scale of the debate surrounding the nature of Hellenistic style. More importantly, the archaeologists' debate played a significant role in Wolfflin's development of his malerisch category, which would have a fundamental effect on the way the history of art would be practiced from then onward.83 The echo of Conze's turn of phrase?picked up by Trendelenburg and others?in Wolfflin's definition of the painterly Baroque (where he argues that there is such as thing as a painterly architecture, even a painterly painting) is unmistakable.84 And developing the argument upon already familiar lines, he explains that when a style becomes painterly, the architectural (or sculptural) features recede. For him, this media overlap is not a defect, as it was earlier for Burckhardt or for Hauck; instead, it is the characteristic feature of a style, the Baroque. From a sign of decline, a painterly art had moved into the pantheon of hallowed styles thanks to the Pergamon frieze. Finally, for Wolfflin, architecture was ultimately sculpture. And Brunn's role in forming this perspective was fundamental. In the Prologomena Wolfflin formulated for the first time his understanding of the three-way relationship between artwork, its production, and its reception. And, as is well known, he posited the body as the hinge connecting the three. His test case was architecture. In his view, "corporeal forms [korperliche Formen] can be characteristic only because we also possess a body."85 It is through this bodily link that architecture acquires meaning for the viewer; not directly, but through "korperliches Miterleben" (bodily empathy). In Renaissance und Barock, he returns to this view and applies it to a specific style: "We interpret all objects by analogy with our bodies" and he concludes "[mjoreover it is clear that architecture, an art of corporeal masses, can relate to man only as a corporeal being."86 The rising empathy theory was clearly a significant factor in Wolfflin's conception of forms. But Brunn's reading of the bodies locked in mortal combat in the Pergamon Gigantomachia as a representation of the forces at work in the architectural ensemble carried the power of an actual example; one, moreover, of significant prominence and recognized aesthetic value. Years later, this approach would be identified?and criticized?by August Schmarsow who took objection to the Korperlichkeit and malerisch concepts that Wolfflin had advocated. In his two books of 1896 and 1897 respectively, he placed the category of "painterly" under the microscope, precisely because in the interval it had acquired even greater status and even stronger 80.

His paper was intended as a critique of the Laocoon by way of Quattrocento art, specifically Ghiberti's "painterly reliefs," although modern art and the relationship between painting and sculpture were at the core of his inquiry. Although he did not name the Pergamon altar directly, the choice of topic was driven by it as was its bibliography?Warburg quoted both Conze and Hauck and relied heavily on the latter.88 But Schmarsow's critique was ultimately much more pointed. Wolfflin was his target and so were his broadly understood malerisch as well as his apperception theory of forms, which were based on a conception of architecture as solid body (Korperlichkeit) that enters into dialogue with the body sense of the viewers?calls it into service, as it were. Instead, Schmarsow posited space (Hohlraum) as the style location for architecture.89 His perspective was, of course, complementary to Wolfflin's Korperlichkeit, one emphasizing "figure" the other "ground." Schmarsow wanted to resist the effects of the then-current empathy theory that exalted anthropomorphism and apperception and that increasingly led critics and art historians to blur the boundaries between the arts.90 For him the category "painterly" (with its application to Baroque massing and sculptural relief) seemed central to such a confusion of concepts, and therefore in urgent need of revaluation.91 And he put this tendency down to the persistence of the sculpture-based aesthetic ("plastisches Ideal") in German scholarship and to the impact of the Pergamon marbles specifically. He also identified the string of works on relief sculpture from the 1880s that had popularized the concept of "pictorial relief" that eventually led to and found their confirmation in Hildebrand's Das Problem der Form (1893).92 And Schmarsow quotes Brunn, Conze, and Hauck.93 The Pergamon altar had not produced the empathy theory or created the sculpture bias in German aesthetics. But as Schmarsow confirms, it joined them into a powerful alliance by providing the perfect visual catalyst. Rewriting the Baroque was its almost inevitable consequence. A decade later, Arnold von Salis, professor of archaeology at Rostock, charted the reciprocal effect of modern Baroque studies upon the art history of antiquity (fig. 13).94 In a reversal of Wolfflin's presentation of the Baroque, Salis defined the Hellenistic style of the East Mediterranean (read the Pergamon style) as the Hellenistic Baroque. Indeed, his intention to extend a stylistic category across historical periods was so close to Wolfflin's of 1888 that in almost the identical terms to his he included an apology in the preface in which he expressed his regrets that the scope of his book prevented him from a detailed comparison between the two?ancient and modern?Baroque styles.95 Citing a copious literature that made such analogies?of known and little-known authors?he drew attention to the corporeal aspect of the altar's architecture and its dialogue with the figural relief.96 Clearly, he had not read?or did not care about?Schmarsow and continued to look at architecture in terms of Korperlichkeit (corporeal form) rather than Hohlraum (space). This folding of art history upon itself illustrates the movement of scholarship?then as now?in ever tighter spirals where individual fields within the discipline proceed at a different pace and old concepts remain active and propel insights in one long after they have become anachronistic or simply redundant in another. * The interaction of discourses?archaeology, art history, architecture, politics, psychology, and aesthetics?with 87.

Book cover of Arnold von Salis, Der Altar von Pergamon: Ein Beitrag zur Erklarung des hellenistischen Barockstils in Kleinasien (Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1912). their intersection point in the Pergamon altar shows that the rereading of the Baroque, which began in earnest in the 1880s, was not as unmediated as it may seem. In the process of assimilating the spectacular Hellenistic discovery into the ancient canon, categories that were well established and quality judgments long settled needed to be and were revisited. Art historians and archaeologists entered the fray, and the vocabulary and definitions they developed?albeit sometimes in opposition to each other?became associated with the kind of art of extremes that the Pergamon marbles represented. The intensity of the figural in this frieze?as Schmarsow argued?reinforced an old prejudice in favor of figure rather than ground, and added fuel to the apperception fire. Wolfflin's Prologomena of 1886 and his Renaissance und Barock of 1888 are unthinkable without the critical intensity surrounding the Pergamon altar. A way of seeing the "animated fagade" as a major, positive achievement in the artistic production of one period was transported or telescoped onto another, rescuing it from lengthy oblivion. When Wolfflin, Dohme, and Gurlitt wrote about the Italian or German Baroque buildings, their vocabulary, laced with terms like malerisch, focused on the relief effects, on light and shadow, on the decorative screen; and picking them out for special attention, they were drawing from a collective art historical vocabulary, if not consensus. The spotlight had illuminated art of a different kind and set the imagination going. Of course, the Baroque?like the Pergamon marbles?continued to suffer from the prejudices in the field, old sins having long shadows, but both had leaped onto the stage of serious scholarship and the mechanism of reevaluation had been set in motion. As is so often the case, the conditions may be right, the terrain ready, and the issues all in place?yet they remain dispersed, latent, without direction until an event or an object precipitates the whole mix into a focused, consciously driven inquiry or debate. Given when the literature discussed here surfaces?in the late 1880s?and the intensity with which the concept of painterliness (malerisch), of sculptural relief, of animation, and of stylistic change become determining for a positive evaluation (or reevaluation) of the Baroque and galvanize an entire aesthetic sensibility, it is clear that it is the arrival of the Pergamon altar in Berlin that acts as the catalyst, the tangible, concrete event-as object, which gives the discussions a direction and precision, making them converge on one point in time and in one place. Indeed, the discovery of the Pergamon marbles had a similar shock effect in the nineteenth century to the discovery of the Laocoon in the sixteenth, and it is perhaps only historic justice that they should have been pitted against each other by the field. They both redefined the reading of the past and caused a turning point in the sensibilities of the present. There are such "objects" that cause forces to coalesce, that attract theory, that speak to the imagination?in some ways they come at the moments when they are needed, almost as confirmation of what was latent in contemporary culture, as a visual fulcrum that concentrates attention in one place and hence literally objectifies what is unspoken. And the Pergamon altar is one of them.</page></plain_text>
