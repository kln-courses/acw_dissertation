<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peirce's Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism Bruce Altshuler Recent dissatisfaction with the correspondence theory of truth and, more generally, with metaphysical realism warrants a new look at Peirce's view of truth.1 Marking a true statement as one which would be agreed to by the community of scientific investigators at the ideal end of inquiry, Peirce appears to avoid standard objections to viewing truth as some kind of correspondence between a given statement and the world, or a certain state of affairs. And in characterizing what is real as the object (s) of such ultimate beliefs, Peirce seems to avoid all talk of a world whose existence is intelligible apart from some explicit reference to its being an object of thought. While the scientistic spirit of Peirce's perspective would make his analysis less than attractive to many these days,2 the question of whether or not Peirce really did provide an alternative to metaphysical realism merits discussion. Like so much of Peirce's work, his remarks on truth and reality admit of numerous interpretations, and one can find evidence of both realism and anti-realism within his voluminous writings. The central question is whether Peirce's view was intended to give a definition, rather than a contingent characterization, of what it is for a proposition (or state- ment, sentence, belief, thought, or judgment) to be true. Some have taken his talk of "the opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate" ( 5.407) 3 in this way, while others have inter- preted him as relying on a correspondence theory at the ground level. The position to be supported below sides with the former suggestion, and seeks to reconstruct Peirce's talk of correspondence in terms of his view of truth as what lies at the ideal limit of scientific investigation. Like James and Dewey, Peirce reformulates the relevant correspondence relation without committing himself to any version of metaphysical realism. Support for this interpretation comes from a number of fronts. We will see Peirce's analysis of truth to issue from a theory of reality designed to ground an idealistic metaphysics. In the course of delimiting such an idealistic conception of the real, Peirce presents explicitly anti-</page><page sequence="2">Peirce's Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism 3 5 realistic arguments concerning the nature of truth. These arguments, which surface during the period of the genesis of pragmatism, attack metaphysical realism as unintelligible, but do not stem from the prag- matic theory of meaning. Peirce thus presents anti-realist arguments before he develops the account of meaning with which his view of truth is usually associated. Later Peirce does attack metaphysical realism on the basis of meaning- theoretic considerations, but he is only supporting in a new way a position for which he had argued earlier. In argumenta- tive strategy, as we will see, each of his approaches bears some similarity to current lines of anti-realism. And both strategies support the view that truth is being defined in terms of the ideal limit of scientific inquiry. A close look at Peirce's talk of correspondence will not reveal any conflict with such a position, and will be seen to anticipate remarks of later pragmatists. Despite the interpretive space provided by the variety and breadth of the Peircean corpus, a single picture emerges. The Origin of Peirce's Theory of Truth4 When Peirce presented the classic statement of his view of truth in "How To Make Our Ideas Clear** (1878), he utilized it as an example of the pragmatic elucidation of meaning to which that article was devoted. The upshot of applying the "pragmatic maxim*' to make clear the concepts of truth and reality was the following: The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real. ( 5.407) 5 Such is the "conceived practical effect*' (5.402) of a proposition being true - that it would be agreed to by all rational inquirers at the ideal end of scientific investigation.6 Since it is most natural to view the pragmatic perspective on meaning as derived from the dispositional account of belief embraced by Peirce in the early 1870's,7 and presented immediately before the first explicit statement of the pragmatic maxim (5.394ff.), one might take Peirce's account of truth as essentially similar in origin to those of James and Dewey. Both James and Dewey viewed their own pragmatic theories of truth as issuing from the functional/instrumental view of thought.8 This view, inspired by the evolutionary naturalism Peirce (and James) embraced during the course of Metaphysical Club discussions in 1871-72,</page><page sequence="3">36 Bruce Altshuler and apparent throughout Peirce's work in this period, took beliefs to be habits of action developed in order to accomodate the organism to the demands of its environment.9 In Peirce, such accommodation was achieved through what has become known as the 'doubt-belief theory of inquiry.'10 While the ways in which the respective views of truth were derived from this naturalistic picture differed between Peirce and James/Dewey, the similarity is clear. For James and Dewey, the function of thought is to provide for the satisfaction of individual needs and desires (given a set of background beliefs and desires) ;n and thus the best thought is the one which optimally achieves the end(s) for which it has been developed, the one which is most "satisfactory."12 Since we seek what is best in the way of thought, and the best thoughts are the true thoughts, truth can be identified with satisfactoriness. For Peirce, beliefs being habits of action implies that the content of any belief is to be revealed by displaying the expectations essentially involved in one's being dis- posed to act a certain way so as to achieve a given end. With regard to truth, what we'd expect in the case of a proposition which we believed were true is that such a claim would be assented to at the ideal end of scientific inquiry - that the more one rationally investigated the matter, the closer one would come to a stable belief that would not be overturned by further inquiry. Such a view involves the utility con- siderations emphasized by the later pragmatists, since experimental verification (confirmation) is at the heart of Peirce's account of the scientific method.13 Unfortunately, this neat picture of the pragmatists and their views of truth loses much of its force when we see that Peirce's analysis of truth antedates his naturalistic theory of inquiry and his pragmatism.14 The first point to make about Peirce's development of this view is that it was originally intended as an account of the nature of reality.15 In a series of papers published in 1868, Peirce presented an elaborate model of knowledge which sought to "reduce all mental action to the formula of valid reasoning" (5.267) by showing that "every sort of modification of consciousness ... is an inference" (5.298).16 The complete explana- tion of every cognitive state was to be given by reference to inferential connections with previous "cognitions" (5.260), and the object of knowledge was marked as the limit toward which this regressive series of mental signs approaches (5.310). Since Peirce rules out talk of the absolutely incognizable by a quasi-Berkeleyan argument,17 he needs some-</page><page sequence="4">Peirce's Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism 37 thing "cognizable" in terms of which to speak of the accuracy with which any cognition represents its object. The view of reality as some- thing essentially cognizable is found at 5.311 in Peirce's defining "the real" as that which sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of you and me. Thus, the very origin of the concep- tion of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a COMMUNITY, without definite limits, and capable of a definite increase in knowledge.18 Peirce was thus able to define reality without refering to a cognitively inaccessible ding an sich, but also without falling into a subjective form of idealism. Reality is specified as independent of the thoughts of any particular individuals, but not as independent of "thought in general" (7.336, 1873; cf. 8.12, 1871). Before looking more closely at the dependence of such a reality on thought, we must make clear why the conception in question constitutes a conception of reality. Peirce says that he derived from Scotus the notion of the real "as that whose characters are independent of what anybody may think them to be" (5.40 5, 1878), as that which "is as it is, whether you or I or any group of men think it to be so or not" (8.153, 1900). 19 The object of the ultimate opinion would qualify as real in Scotus' sense, since it is what it is whatever any determinate individual (s) might think about it. The ultimate scientific opinion, for Peirce, is an ideal only intelligible as a limit toward which endless investigation would approach.20 Peirce's radical fallibilism coincides with his perspective here, for if no one can ever know that his or her belief on any matter is true, then the ultimate opinion is what it is despite anyone's belief as to its content. (Cf. 5.565) By 1870 Peirce was explicitly coupling the conception of reality as the object of the ultimate opinion with the notion of truth as this ultimate opinion itself (#587, Dfs. 4-5).21 But his primary concern was with formulating a conception of reality which would provide "the point of view from which it is proper to look at the matter in order to under- stand its true philosophy" (7.335). The matter at issue is the nature of reality, and Peirce saw the choice to lie between two alternatives: conceiving of reality as the unperceived cause of our sensations in the</page><page sequence="5">38 Bruce Altshuler manner of Descartes' causal realism, and taking reality to be the object of the opinion lying at the ideal end of scientific inquiry (7.33 5-3 39, 8. 12-. 17). Peirce associated the former conception of reality with nominalism, and the latter approach with realism concerning the existence of universals (7.339, 8.12, 8.25).22 Part of holding to the "true philosophy" on this issue was, for Peirce, being a realist with regard to universals - for this was the period at which he began to connect all philosophical evils with nominalism (8.3 8). But of more interest to us is the way in which Peirce's preferred notion of reality allowed him to circumvent what he saw as the errors of metaphysical realism. To see what it is that Peirce wanted to avoid, we must look at some material from 1873. Anti-Realist Arguments The position that Peirce is concerned to repudiate asserts that we can frame a notion of reality which contains no essential reference to thought. He presents a barrage of arguments designed to show that the concept of a reality or of realities that exist "entirely independent of thought" (7.345) is unintelligible. This position is anticipated in Peirce's 1868 attack on "the incognizable," where he argued that any conception of "being" must imply that what has being is knowable (5.2 57).23 But in the early 1870's he draws more explicitly anti-realist conclusions. At one point Peirce again echoes Berkeley's claim that we cannot conceive of something existing unperceived by arguing that we can have no concept of something about which we could not think. What idea can be attached to that of which there is no idea? . . . It is clear that it is quite beyond the power of the mind to have an idea of something entirely independent of thought - it would have to extract itself from itself for that purpose; and since there is no such idea there can be no meaning in the expression. (7.345) Of course, we can readily imagine any of our accepted beliefs to be false, but this cannot be by way of thinking that they fail to fit with something the conception of which involves no reference to thought. It is only by reference to what would be believed at the ideal end of inquiry that error is intelligible. This is what is "independent of our own</page><page sequence="6">Peirce9 s Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism 39 limited views" {Ibid.). And conceiving of reality as the object of this ultimate opinion is conceiving of it in terms of thought (7.336). In another manuscript from 1873 Peirce argues that no other way of delimiting the nature of truth could avoid a specification in terms of thought. He claims that we cannot make sense of appropriate relations of similarity, correspondence, or causation between things and ideas except by taking the relevant relation to be constituted by thought. With regard to similarity, Peirce makes the familiar Berkeley an point that an idea can resemble only another idea. A conception is said to be true if there exists such a thing independent of all thought. But a thing out of all thought can have no likeness to another, for likeness is the common element that two notions have. (#372, p. 6) Such a relation consists in there being a certain result to an operation of mental comparison, and (from the standpoint of Peirce's 1868 theory of thought- signs) is constituted by a hypothetical inference (5.288; cf. 1.383, 4. 157, 7.332, 7.349). Substituting the concept of corres- pondence for that of resemblance would only be to replace "one relation of reason for another," for one thing corresponds to another only insofar "as the mind regards them as correlates" (#372, p. 6). Just as definitions of truth which utilize similarity and correspondence relations are taken to constitute the truth-relation by thought, so would the attempt to define a true conception as "one which is produced by something existing out of thought," for this "would be equivalent to saying that a logically inferred notion is true and an illogical one false, thus placing the distinc- tion in what takes place in thought" {Ibid.). Here again Peirce appeals to his 1868 theory, where every thought is said to issue from an indefi- nitely long series of logical inferences. His conclusion is that "there is a complete vacuity of meaning in saying that independent of all thought there exist such things as we shall think in the final opinion" (#372, p. 7), because we cannot characterize these independent realities in terms which do not essentially refer to thought. In the same manuscript Peirce offers other arguments to this con- clusion, that the metaphysical picture grounding causal realism "is mere words without meaning" (#372, p. 5). It does not make sense to speak of "such things as we shall think in the final opinion" as existing "entirely independent of all thought" because "what we think when we</page><page sequence="7">40 Bruce Altshuler have an opinion are thoughts" (Ibid.). He claims that we would have to make sense of a thought existing "independent of all thought" in order to accept his opponent's view. Here Peirce seems either to be confusing thought with what is thought about, or to be implicitly assuming that the object of a thought must be a thought. The former alternative seems unlikely, as even in this period he was quite aware of the im- portance of distinguishing among a sign, its meaning, and its denotation.24 That the latter tack is his own can be seen in another argument from #372, in which Peirce asks us to imagine that we were all omniscient beings. By the nature of the case, realities would be the objects of our beliefs. To draw any distinction whatever in that case between the object of a belief and the reality would be idle. . . . This is a simple demonstration that the conception of a reality as it is in itself in contradistinction to the reality as it may be known is a self-contradictory statement. For in the case we have supposed the very reality would be an object of belief, - a thought. (#372, pp. 8f.) This position fits with many remarks to the effect that "Whatever is capable of being represented is itself of a representative nature."25 These passages also illustrate the way in which Peirce combined an ontological idealism - viewing reality as thought-like - with an attack on the intelligibility of metaphysical realism.26 His intention is to use arguments against metaphysical realism in support of such an idealistic ontology, yet he is not careful in distinguishing these two points from one another. That it is self-contradictory to distinguish things-in- themselves from things-as-known also is said to follow from the meanings of the terms 'reality', 'truth', 'belief, and 'inquiry'. Writing on March 10, 1873, Peirce argues that the fact that "reality is what is represented in the final belief" is not "owing to some peculiar faculty of ours by which our final belief will always represent the reality which is independent of it" (#379, p. 3). Relying on the terms of the doubt-belief model of inquiry that he was developing at this time, Peirce claimed that his view of truth and reality could be derived from an analysis of the concepts involved. Inquiry is a struggle to escape from the "irritation of doubt" which prompts it, and by definition the end of this process</page><page sequence="8">Peirce*s Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism 41 is a settled belief. It is also a matter of definition that truth is the goal of inquiry, for any investigator who sincerely believes that he or she has reached the truth on any matter ceases his or her inquiry. "So that the object of a final truth settled opinion not merely coincides with the truth, but is the truth by the very definition of the words" (#379, p. 4) ,27 Peirce finds in this conclusion additional support for the idealistic claim that reality "in no case can transcend thought altogether" (#379, p. 6), for analysis shows that the concept of reality contains the concept of the ultimate opinion. But again we must distinguish the ontological thesis that reality is thought-like from the conceptual point that we cannot frame a notion of the real except in terms of cognitive concepts. In the early 1870's, then, we have seen Peirce argue against the intelligibility of metaphysical realism, against the notion of a world that can be considered to exist "entirely independent of all thought." Although Peirce's goal was to establish an idealism which viewed reality itself as thought-like, the arguments we have discussed attack the meta- physical realist's claim that we can conceive of a world-as-it-is-in-itself. If reference to thought is ineliminable from every possible characteri- zation of reality, then attempts to make sense of metaphysical realism are doomed to failure - for the notion of a world independent of thought is illusory. While this is the period during which Peirce is developing his pragmatic theory of meaning, it is quite clear that his early anti-realist arguments do not depend on this account of meaning.28 Later, of course, Peirce presents his view of truth and reality as following from the application of the pragmatic maxim to those concepts (5.40 5 if.). And still later in his development he argues against the independence of reality from thought on pragmatic grounds, claiming that the practical import (and, therefore, the entire content) of the notion of reality is revealed by our expectations concerning experiences we would have with real things. Perhaps the clearest statement of this later approach occurs in the paper "What Pragmatism Is," published in 1905 in The Monist. Here Peirce claims that the only acceptable definition of truth is that which utilizes the concepts of doubt and belief. The passage is worth quoting in full. You only puzzle yourself by talking of this metaphysical "truth" and metaphysical "falsity," that you know nothing about. All you have any dealings with are your doubts and</page><page sequence="9">42 Bruce Altshuler beliefs, with the course of life which forces new beliefs upon you and gives you power to doubt old beliefs. If your terms "truth" and "falsity" are taken in such senses as to be definable in terms of doubt and belief and the course of experience (as for example they would be, if you were to define the "truth" as that to a belief in which belief would tend if it were to tend indefinitely toward absolute fixity), well and good: in that case you are only talking about doubt and belief. But if by truth and falsity you mean something not definable in terms of doubt and belief in any way, then you are talking of entities of whose existence you can know nothing, and which Ockham's razor would clean shave off. (5.416) Peirce is not just saying that "metaphysical" notions of truth make it impossible for anyone to ever know that what they believe is true, for as a radical fallibilist he was willing to accept that situation as unavoidable. His objection is that on non-pragmatic accounts one could never know what it would be like for a proposition to be true, for to know that one must define truth and falsity in experiential terms. As he says elsewhere, ". . . beyond the realm of verification, truth and falsity lose their meanings."29 Of course, this is verification "in the long run" - but the important point is that the concepts of truth and falsity are explicated in potentially "practical" terms.30 In later writings Peirce also connected the idea of reality with his ontological/phenomenological category of Secondness, characterized by the concepts of reaction, force, and insistency. "The reality of things consists in their persistent forcing themselves upon our recognition" (1.175, c. 1897). "[R]eality is the dynamical reaction of certain forms upon the mind of the community. . . ." (6.612, 1893). 31 This perspec- tive grounds another attempt to define reality in pragmatic terms, an account in which the application of scientific method "forces" investi- gators to certain conclusions. Having sketched a picture of the tripartite process of scientific inquiry - "conjecture; deductions of predications from the conjecture; testing the predications by experimentation" (7.671, c. 1903) - Peirce says, I do not know what idea we can form of reality except that it is that threefold force; or what the real can be except that which the whole process tends, as we hope to induce our thoughts to rest upon. (7.669, c. 1903)</page><page sequence="10">Pence's Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism 43 Here again we are said to be unable to form a notion of reality except in terms of possible experience. The point of cataloguing these arguments is to show that Peirce intended to reject metaphysical realism in proposing his own definition of truth. The fundamental strut of the realist position is its insistence that the reality with which our true statements are in accord is inde- pendent of all thought, or representation. This view implies that, as Putnam puts it, "truth is supposed to be radically non-epistemic"*2 and thus the definition of truth can contain no essential reference to cognitive states or operations. In his remarks concerning the nature of both truth and reality, we have seen Peirce reject this picture. But some com- mentators have suggested that Peirce does embrace a correspondence theory of truth on the most basic level of analysis, a position which threatens the validity of the present interpretation.33 So it is to Peirce's view of correspondence that we now turn. Truth and Correspondence From Peirce's earliest through his latest work, one can find what appear to be clear statements of a correspondence view of truth. In an 1867 review of Venn's The Logic of Chance, Peirce writes that truth is "the agreement of a representation with its object..." (8.3). In 1878 we find his claim that "Truth consists in the existence of a real fact corresponding to the true proposition" (2.652). And as late as 1906 we see him, with Kant, accept the claim that "truth is the correspondence of a representation with its object" as the "nominal definition" of truth (5.553; cf. 1.578). Surely it is this kind of evidence that leads such writers as Nicholas Rescher and Susan Haack to view Peirce as funda- mentally committed to a correspondence theory of truth.34 Yet a wideranging look at Peirce's remarks on the correspondence relation involved reveals that he generally does not speak about the matching of a thought with an uninterpreted reality. Rather, Peirce most often is concerned with the correspondence of a given belief with the (ideal) ultimate opinion on the question at issue. Like James and Dewey, as we will see, Peirce wants to view truth- as-correspondence in terms of a relation holding between cognitive entities. A perfect example occurs at 5.5 53, directly after Peirce expresses his agreement with Kant's "nominal definition" of truth. He claims that if the nature of this correspondence is not specified in human terms, then truth has a meaning "for which we have no use."35 To avoid that</page><page sequence="11">44 Bruce Altshuler situation, Peirce claims that we should define truth as "the last result to which the following out of [the right method of transforming signs], would ultimately carry us." Here would be a case in which that to which the representation would conform, is itself some- thing in the nature of a representation, or sign - something noumenal, intelligible, conceivable, and utterly unlike a thing- in-itself. Peirce explicitly specifies the nature of the correspondence relation in this way on numerous occasions: Agreement with that ultimate proposition that we look forward to, - agreement with that, whatever it may turn out to be, is the scientific truth. (7.187, c. 1901) . . . the only thing to which inquiry seeks to make our opinion conform is itself something of the nature of thought; namely, it is the predestined ultimate idea, which is independent of what you, I, or any number of men may persist, for however long, in thinking (8.103, 1900)36 Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief (5.565, 1901) And this is not a view to which Peirce only came in his later years, for in 1873 we find him saying that that permanency, that fixed reality, which every thought strives to represent and image, we have placed in this objective point, towards which the current of thought flows. (7.3 37) 37 Peirce, then, is concerned to understand talk of correspondence as relating two things to which we have (potential) cognitive access. Clearly, he has no use for, and claims that it can make no pragmatic sense to speak about, the traditional correspondence relation. In this he is followed by the later pragmatists.</page><page sequence="12">Peirce's Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism 45 Both James and Dewey acknowledge that truth involves a relation of correspondence or agreement, but each claims that the nature of that relation can only be determined by pragmatic analysis.38 They agree in opposing what is marked as a "static" correspondence relation utilized by the "intellectualist" tradition, and both present arguments against the "copy theory" of a mental representation picturing a reality which completely transcends immediate experience.39 Of direct concern to us here is the way in which James and Dewey think that we ought to talk about correspondence and truth. James' position was initially presented in 1884 in "The Function of Cognition," which presents a view which he later took to diffuse the force of Royce's argument for an absolute mind as the only possible account of reference.40 Briefly, the relation between an idea and its object is the functional one of that idea "leading" to certain expected experiences. The fact that projected experiences are forthcoming in appropriate circumstances in part constitutes the truth of the repre- sentation in question. Hence James* many remarks relating truth and verifiability.41 The "agreement" involved in truth is an agreement among ideas - it is that correspondence between an expected experience and the experience that actually occurs (or would occur) in the relevant cir- cumstance.42 "Truth ... is a relation, not of our ideas to non-human realities, but of conceptual parts of our experience to sensational parts."43 Finding no content in the standard talk of thought corres- ponding to reality, the pragmatist demands a concrete account of what such agreement amounts to; and that account refers to the "concrete workings" of an idea in leading from one bit of the "experience- continuum" to another so as to satisfy human needs and desires.44 Dewey also specifies the correspondence relation constitutive of truth as a connection between cognitive entities. The relation obtains between a "purpose, plan and its execution, fulfillment"; and the result is the verification, or success, of the initial belief that certain actions would bring about certain consequences.45 Dewey claims that if truth is constituted by the traditional sort of correspondence relation, there would be no essential connection between truth and experience, no such thing as verification through the fulfillment of expectations (predic- tions).46 Ultimately, of course, Dewey eliminated all talk of truth in favor of warranted assertibility, for he thought that this would clearly display the essential and epistemically accessible feature of knowledge -</page><page sequence="13">46 Bruce Altshuler that it is the result of successful inquiry.47 But earlier he opted for the route we've seen Peirce and James travel, accepting truth as constituted by a correspondence relation whose terms are accessible to possible experience. We have thus seen Peirce utilize the notion of correspondence much as James and Dewey were to use it - as a nominal accommodation to the going conceptual tradition which would not compromise the primacy of inquiry and verifiability. Truth was not to be defined in terms of a relation between a representation and a thing-in-itself, for none of the pragmatists believed that we could meaningfully speak of the latter. Having made sense of Peirce's talk of agreement and correspondence without vitiating his attack on metaphysical realism, we are ready to look briefly at some recent positions taken in opposition to realism. Contemporary Anti-Realism Peirce's somewhat abstruse arguments against metaphysical realism might be taken as merely historical oddities were it not for the recent resurgence of a revolt against realism. Not surprisingly, the major figures of this movement are heavily influenced by the pragmatic tra- dition. With the exception of Michael Dummett, all of these philosophers - Nelson Goodman, W.V.O. Quine, and Hilary Putnam - come out of the American intellectual amalgam of indigenous pragmatism and imported logical empiricism; and Dummett's Wittgensteinian roots con- nect his views with another strand of pragmatism.48 But whatever the complicated stories behind the development of recent versions of anti- realism,49 their existence gives Peirce's work on this topic more than historical interest. Dummett's view might seem the closest to Peirce's later arguments, for his position moves from a certain theory of meaning to the rejection of realism.50 For Dummett, realism involves a truth-conditional account of meaning - the view that one's understanding of a sentence consists in knowledge of its truth-conditions, rather than in knowledge of what would count as evidence for it. This latter theory, verificationist semantics, is the anti-realist's account of meaning. It is on the basis of the inadequacy of truth-conditional semantics, and the associated principle of bivalence, that Dummett argues against realism. But note that Peirce's move from the pragmatic account of meaning to his definition of truth claims that the application of this meaning-analysis to the</page><page sequence="14">Pence's Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism 47 concept of truth yields the specification in question; whereas Dummett argues that realism is false because it implies the truth of an illegitimate theory of meaning. Goodman characterizes his position as "a radical relativism under rigorous restraints, that eventuates in something akin to irrealism."51 What is relative is truth (or, more generally, "rightness of fit" of a "version" to a "world"), and what it is relative to is a "world" or a "version" of a world.52 This position is grounded in an analysis of the plurality of symbol systems that human beings use. Physical science, poetic creation, the plastic arts, ordinary language, and many other practices each create worlds by constructing symbolic "versions." Not all of these are denotational, but all are "versions" of "worlds." Now truth is only relevant for denotational systems, though it has to do with both literal and metaphorical statements. The important concept for every kind of version is "rightness of fit" to a given world (the world of which it is a version), and truth is to be explained as a special case of this generic relation.53 The crucial point for our concern is the claim that two "right versions" can conflict. Since one cannot allow two contradictory statements to be true in the same world (for that would imply the truth of every meaningful statement in that world, since all statements follow from a contradiction) , one must reject one of the statements as false, take them each to be true of a different world, or show that they can be reconciled with one another.54 In many cases we will have to opt for the second alternative, and thus we end up with a plurality of worlds, each "created" by the construction of a version of it. This situation leads to a rejection of the correspondence theory of truth, for there is no single "ready-made world" awaiting accurate representa- tion.55 In addition to this bit of "irrealism," we also find Goodman construing rightness of fit as the "ultimate acceptability" of a version - a position which sounds very much like Dewey 's replacing truth with warranted assertibility at the end of inquiry.56 While Quine is not an explicitly committed anti-realist, his work can naturally be associated with that perspective. The thesis of "onto- logical relativity," especially, seems to set the stage for a rejection of metaphysical realism.57 This view claims that the ontological commit- ment of a given theory can only be specified, and only make sense as so specified, relative to another theory indicating those entities to which the original theory's terms refer. Thus, for Quine, truth is relative to a theory in which one specifies the referents of the terms of the discourse</page><page sequence="15">48 Bruce Altshuler in question. ". . . existence in its final estate is theoretical."58 Or, as Quine sometimes puts it, truth is immanent and not transcendent. Although Quine follows Tarski in his method of giving truth-definitions for the sentences of a language, and thus considers himself to be as much a realist as anyone can be,59 his support of ontologica! relativity im- plicitly challenges metaphysical realism. In Quine's view one must refer to a given theory as interpreted by another theory in order to speak of the referents of the terms of the original theory, in order to speak of what exists if that theory is true. This means that we cannot just speak of the world as what a true theory refers to, but only as what another theory says that the initial theory is talking about (and similarly for the reference-specifying theory) . This seems to make it impossible to set up the model of metaphysical realism, which requires an absolute relation between the world and a true theory. With reference as relative, theory enters into the very nature of the reference relation. This point recalls Peirce's 1873 arguments, in which he claimed that we could not set up the requisite picture of realism, because the very elements of the model have to be specified in terms of thought. Putnam's position in "Realism and Reason" constitutes the most explicit attack on the intelligibility of realism, for he is concerned to argue that metaphysical realism just makes no sense. He presents three arguments; but since the later two are closely related to positions of Goodman and Quine, only the first will be discussed.60 Putnam's strategy is to show that metaphysical realism implies the truth of an incoherent claim - the assertion that a pragmatically ideal theory can be false.61 Assume a pragmatically ideal theory that is false. Then one can construct a correspondence (or satisfaction) relation under which the hypothetical theory would be true modulo that relation, where truth is defined by a one-to-one mapping of a model of the given theory (with the same cardinality as the world) onto the world. Putnam claims that it would make no sense to distinguish that satisfaction relation from the "real" reference relation which would, by hypothesis, be a different one - for the constructed relation meets all operational and theoretical constraints on reference, i.e. it marks the same sentences as true and as false as does the "real" relation, and "it makes the ideal theory . . . come out true."62 Putnam takes this argument to support Peirce's view about the point at which "metaphysical realism collapses into coherence" - that point being the attempt to distinguish a true theory from one which is pragmatically ideal.63 But one should also note that Putnam's argument has the same</page><page sequence="16">Pence's Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism 49 intention as do Peirce's arguments - to show that metaphysical realism is unintelligible. In this brief overview of recent anti-realism we can see two argu- mentative strategies, each of which echoes an approach to be found in Peirce.64 Dummett, loosely following later work of Wittgenstein, attacks realism on meaning-theoretic grounds, as being incompatible with the only valid account of understanding. In this one can see an affinity with Peirce's later positions, which stem from his pragmatic theory of meaning. Goodman, Quine, and Putnam work from a direct consideration of reference and truth, worrying about the intelligibility of metaphysical realism itself.65 Here there is a clear similarity with Peirce's arguments of the early 1870's, where he claims that one should reject metaphysical realism on the basis of an investigation of that metaphysical picture. In Peirce, then, we can see prefigured both of the anti-realist strategies being presented in the current literature. Conclusion We have seen Peirce reject metaphysical realism from two perspectives - the first based on arguments attempting to establish the dependence of reality on thought, and the second relying on the pragmatic theory of meaning. The arguments of the early 1870's try to show that one cannot make sense of the realist's metaphysical picture, for reference to thought is ineliminable from any conception of reality. Later presenta- tions claim that the only significance that we can give to talk of truth and reality defines them in terms of possible experience consequent on certain actions. While some of Peirce's remarks appear to speak of truth as correspondence with the world, he interprets the correspondence relation in terms of an agreement between a given belief and the opinion lying at the ideal end of inquiry. And thus, like James and Dewey, he accommodates the language of the correspondence theory within a non-realist metaphysics. While a quick survey of some recent anti-realist positions suggests affinities with Peirce's work, we must not forget the completely different contexts in which these arguments were presented. Peirce's discussions were part of an effort to establish an idealistic metaphysics, and were set amidst attacks on materialism, nominalism, and individualism (e.g. 8.38). Recent anti-realism takes a different tack, mostly relying on considerations of technical philosophy of language. The tone of recent work tends to the dissolving of metaphysical problems, rather than the</page><page sequence="17">50 Bruce Altshuler construction of ontologies. But even with these differences in mind, it is interesting to see such a characteristic element of nineteenth century thought return in our own time, in the very midst of analytic philosophy.66 University of Puget Sound NOTES 1. My use of 'metaphysical realism' follows that of Hilary Putnam in "Realism and Reason," Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association (50) August 1977, pp. 483-498. This essay is also reprinted in Putnam's Meaning and the Moral Sciences (London, Henley, and Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978), pp. 123-140. References to this paper in what follows are to the earlier printing. As is apparent from the context, this is not realism concerning the existence of universals (for Peirce, what he called his 'scholastic realism') but is a thesis about the relation of our beliefs, statements, and theories to reality. 2. Attacks on the cognitive primacy of science can be found in Feyerabend's Against Method (London: Verso, 1975), Goodman's Ways of Worldtnaking (Indiana- polis and Cambridge: Hackett, 1978), as well as in popular presentations by such writers as Theodore Roszak. On the continent, such an attack has been sustained by the Frankfurt School, especially by Habermas, for years. 3.

That this is not the whole story of the genesis of Peirce's pragmatic view of meaning, since it ignores the way in which this theory grew out of his 1867-68 "theory of thought-signs," is argued in my "The Nature of Peirce's Pragmatism," Transactions of the Charles S.

On this theory, see e.g. Israel Schef fler, Four Pragmatists (New York: Humanities Press, 1974), pp. 5 8 if. 11. There are many problems with the appeal to functional explanation in this context. For a discussion of some of them, as bearing on Peirce's use of this scheme, see my "Peirce on Progress and Meaning," forthcoming in the proceedings of the C. S. Peirce Bicentennial International Congress. 12. Here I ignore the differences between James and the early Dewey on truth as satisfaction. For Dewey's critical remarks on James on this point, see Essays in Experimental Logic, pp. 317ff. 13. Peirce viewed the method of science as having three components: abduction (hypothesis formation), deduction (of experimental consequences of the proposed theory), and induction (statistical confirmation or disconfirmation of the hypothesis experimentally tested). 14. But the picture is illuminating if one considers the idealized version of Peirce's pragmatism, ignoring the fact that different aspects of his view developed at different times (e.g. the pragmatic maxim and his account of real possibility allowing sense to be made of talk of what would be agreed upon in the indefinite future). 15. This point is made most clearly in the only detailed account we have of Peirce's philosophical development, Murray Murphey's The Development of Peirce's Philosophy (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961). Also see his chapter on Peirce in volume 2 of E. Flower and M. Murphey, A History of Philosophy in America (New York: Capricorn and G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1977). 16. The modes of inference to which Peirce appeals are induction, deduction, and hypothesis, the schemata for which are first presented in the 1867 paper "On the Natural Classification of Arguments," 2.461 -.5 16 (see especially 2.5O8ff.). 17. His view is that any notion one can frame of such a thing is itself a cognition, and so is not a thought of the incognizable (5.257; cf. 7.345). While at 8.33 (1871) Peirce expresses reservations about using this sort of a priori argument, in this case he took himself to be justified in rejecting the notion of something of which he could not conceive because he had an alternative view which did not postulate any incognizables. 18. One must take Peirce's insistence on the primacy of community here with a grain of salt. His account of scientific method does not imply that such rational activity must involve a plurality of different individuals, but only that we need to consider inquiry "over the long run." Peirce himself seems to admit that any indi- vidual with an infinite lifespan and resources would discover the true answer to any question for which there is an answer (8.12). On this point, Murray Murphey (The Development of Peirce's Philosophy, pp. 14 If.) * correctly notes that an infinite series of inquiries is all that Peirce's view demands, if the end of inquiry is to be viewed as an ideal. What Peirce wants to eliminate is the "arbitrary, accidental element [in human opinion], dependent on the limitations in circumstance, power, and</page><page sequence="19">52 Bruce Altshuler bent of the individual" (8.12). He is after the pure rational agent here, and truth on his view is determined by the agency of the scientific intellect, not by essentially intersubjective activity. The force of the appeal to community is to abstract pure rationality from the personal idiosyncrasy of concrete individuals. This is a Kantian picture, reminiscent of the derivation of the moral law from reason alone. Peirce's "social theory of logic" (5.3 54, 2.654) admits of a similar non-communitarian inter- pretation, it seems to me. On these points, see the paper cited in note 4. 19. The earliest place where I can find Peirce utilizing this notion of reality is in notes for a series of logic lectures for 1870-71, under Df. 3 in manuscript #587, as listed in R. Robin, Annotated Catalogue of the Papers of Charles S. Peirce (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1967). Peirce consistently used this notion of the real throughout his philosophical career, calling it at 5.52 5 (c.1905) "a verbal definition, not a doctrine." One can also find him speaking of the real in this way at 1.578, -2.173, 3.161, 5.118, 5.384, 5.408, 5.430, 5.565, 6.95, 6.328, 6.349, 6.453, 6.495, 7.336nll, 7.339, 7.659, 8.12f., 8.103, 8.144, and 8.191. For the corresponding doctrine concerning truth, see 2.55, 2.137, 2.139, 2.153, 5.211, 8.12, and 8.126. 20. In Word and Object (Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 1960, p. 23) Quine claims that Peirce's use of the notion of a limit here is illegitimate, as the relation of "nearer than" is not defined for theories. Karl Popper has attempted to remedy this problem in his analysis of degrees of "verisimilitude" of theories. See "Truth, Rationality, and the Growth of Knowledge," in Conjectures and Refutations (New York: Basic Books, 1962), pp. 23 Iff. 21. Citations of this form refer to unpublished manuscripts, as numbered in Richard Robin's catalogue (see note 19). I am grateful to the Harvard University Department of Philosophy and to Max Fisch for permission to use this material in The Houghton Library. 22. The way in which causal /representational realism is said to lead to nominalism is briefly sketched at 8.12. Peirce's claim seems to be that the skepticism implicit in causal/representational realism only allows us to understand two real things having a common characteristic in terms of their both producing "sensations which may be embraced under one conception." Such a view would not, he claims, even justify our attributing a common property to two sensations - we only could say that a single "mental term or thought-sign . . . stands indifferently for either of the sensible objects caused by the two external realities." 23. Peirce actually makes a stronger claim: "Over and against any cognition, there is an unknown but knowable reality; but over against all possible cognition, there is only the self-contradictory. In short, cognizability (in its widest sense) and being are not merely metaphorically the same, but are synonymous terms." (5.2 57) In a manuscript from March 10, 1873 Peirce presents another loose argument that "thought must be implied as part of the meaning of the word" 'existence' (#379, pp. 6f.). Since 'reality' (or 'what exists') is "the most general of expressions," - presumably because it applies to all entities - and all things that could be used to form this most general notion "agree in being objects of thought," Peirce concludes that "we can have no conception of anything which is not an object of thought." 24. E.g. #587, Df. 3 (1870), "The meaning must be carefully distinguished from the sign itself and from the thing signified."</page><page sequence="20">Peirce's Theory of Truth and the Revolt Against Realism 53 25. This statement is from a 1903 letter to William James, in R. B. Perry, The Thought and Character of William James (Boston: Little, Brown, 193 5)» Vol. 2, p. 429. Cf. 1.339, 1.538, 8.153. 26. The nature of Peirce's idealism during the early 1870's poses a difficult interpretative issue. Murray Murphey views it as a version of phenomenalism. See his The Development of Peirce's Philosophy, pp. 123f., 140f., 167. In the paper cited in note 4, I argue that during this period Peirce identifies reality with the ultimate opinion itself, viewing that ideal opinion as the final cause of the progress of inquiry. If this seems too outlandish a view even for Peirce, consider the following remarks: "The Real thing is the ultimate opinion about it. About it that is about the ultimate opinion...." (#587, Df. 6, 1870) "...to say that thought tends to come to a determinate conclusion, is to say that it tends to an end (,) is influenced by a final cause. This final cause, the ultimate opinion, is independent of how you, or I, or any number of men think. ... So the ultimate conclusion is that which determines opinions and does not depend upon them and so is the real object of cognition. This is idealism since it supposes the real to be of the nature of thought." (#393, p. 1, c.l 873) For a late echo of this position, see 8.103. 27. This claim, that it is analytic that the opinion which would be held at the ideal end of scientific inquiry is true, raises a problem for understanding Peirce's apparent arguments for the thesis that scientific method is self-corrective. The difficulty is to see why Peirce would attempt to so argue, if it is a matter of definition that repeated applications of the scientific method would eventuate in holding true beliefs. One might take this as a case of overdetermination of philosophical argument, viewing the overall position as one supported by a rope rather than a chain of arguments (5.265). But one might also tell a story whereby Peirce dropped the conceptual arguments of 1873 in the late 1870's, deriving his definition of truth from the pragmatic method of meaning analysis. This move would create the need to show that truth is within our potential cognitive grasp, that it is cognitively accessible in the long run. To fill in this account one would have to look closely at which arguments were given when, and how they fit with Peirce's developing attitudes toward scientific investigation. 28. In fact, Peirce's first discussion of the application of pragmatic meaning analysis to the concepts of hardness, weight, and mental capacity was presented in order to display cases analogous to that of reality as he explicates it - cases in which present existence is taken to depend on certain things occurring in the future (7.340ff.). 29. The Nation (57) 1893, p. 394, quoted in Thomas Goudge, The T bought of C. S. Peirce (New York: Dover, 1969), p. 3 37. 30. That such long-run potentialities are not practical at all is argued by Arthur Burks in his introduction to the Peirce selections in Max Fisch, ed., Classic American Philosophers (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1951), pp. 48-52. 31.

See Nicholas Rescher, Peirce's Philosophy of Science (Notre Dame and London: University of Notre Dame Press, 1978), p. 98n33, and Susan Haack, "The Pragmatist Theory of Truth," British Journal of the Philosophy of Science (27) 1976, pp. 23 3, 236, 241f. 3 5. Peirce more often speaks of the truth about any matter being the outcome of all possible inquiry by rational beings, not just those of our species. At 5.5 53 he comes close to the "humanism" (conceptual anthropomorphism) of James and Schiller. For James' presentation of this doctrine, see Lecture VII of Pragmatism (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975) and chapters III and V of The Meaning of Truth (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975). 36. Note that since Peirce often refers to reality as that which is independent of how any determinate individual or individuals think about it, this would be a correspondence between thought and reality. Cf. 8.153 and 5.211. 37. Peirce elsewhere states what seems to be the same position in terms of a true belief corresponding to one which is "stable" (3.430, 1896) or which "furnish (es) a safe basis for predication" (5.96, 1903). Interpretation of 7.337 is complicated by its identifying the final opinion as its own object. See the paper cited in note 4 on this doctrine. 38. The classic statement of James' theory of truth is found in Lecture VI of Pragmatism, with further elaboration to be found in the later essays in The Meaning of Truth. For his acknowledgement that talk of agreement/correspondence is legitimate, see Pragmatism, p. 96 and The Meaning of Truth, p. 6. For the similar admission by Dewey, see Essays in Experimental Logic, pp. 231, 237 and The Influence of Darwin on Philosophy, p. 15 8.

For Dewey 's view on this point, see The Influence of Darwin on Philosophy, pp. 11 Of., 136ff., 156f. H. S.

Michael Dummett offers a similar argument against realism, which he associates with a truth-conditional theory of meaning. Such a view of meaning (understanding), he claims, would give no explana- tion of how we would know what to count as justification (evidence) for accepting a sentence once we've learned the meaning of that sentence.

Of course, no one could deny the highly original character of Wittgenstein's pragmatic perspective. 49. Such stories would look at the influence of C. I. Lewis on Goodman, Quine, and Putnam, connecting that with the influence of their logical empiricist mentors (Carnap in the cases of Goodman and Quine, and Reichenbach in the case of Putnam). Also very important for any view of current anti-realism is the work of Richard Rorty. See especially his "The World Well Lost," Journal of Philosophy (69) 1972, pp. 649-665. 50. The most well-developed statement of Dummett's position is found in his yet unpublished William James Lectures, given at Harvard in 1976, especially in the last lecture.

The reference of the terms of the interpreting theory itself are absolutely "inscrutable"; and that, of course, is because there is nothing there to scrute. There actually is a "double relativity" here, for reference makes sense only relative to a reference-specifying theory, and the interpretation of the original theory in that other theory is itself relative to a transla- tion manual (given the "indeterminacy of translation"). On this point, see "Onto- logical Relativity," pp. 54f. 59. Both Dummett and Putnam argue that accepting Tarski's method of pro- viding truth-definitions does not commit one to any version of realism. See, for instance, Putnam's Meaning and the Moral Sciences, pp. 29ff. 60. The first argument occurs at "Realism and Reason," pp. 48 5f. John Koethe argues that the notion of the ideal theory which Putnam needs for this argument to go through is itself one that a realist need not accept.

It is interesting to note that these Harvard philosophers, standing in the pragmatic tradition of C. I. Lewis, do not choose to argue on pragmatic lines against metaphysical realism. Largely this seems due to their rejection of verifica tionist semantics, thus making unavailable the kind of arguments one finds in the post-1873 Peirce and in Dummett. 66.
