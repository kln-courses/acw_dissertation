<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore 119 (December 2008): 319-334 RESEARCH ARTICLE The Face of the Wolf is Blessed, or is It? Diverging Perceptions of the Wolf David Hunt Abstract Evidence shows divergent perceptions of the wolf in different parts of the world. The populations of Asia, the Near East and the indigenous peoples of North America see the wolf positively, as an ideal hunter, warrior and survivor in the wilderness, although shepherds and animal-herders in these regions seem to have an ambivalent attitude towards the animal. Among many of the peoples mentioned above, there appears to be a desire to emulate the wolf, and magical powers have been attributed to the animal and to his body parts. On the other hand, the wolf is feared as a ravenous beast by the populations of Europe and by European immigrants to America. Introduction The differences between perceptions and reality are often of great interest. In relation to the wolf, however, interest in these differences is increased by the fact that different populations have almost diametrically opposed perceptions of the animal, none of which coincide closely with reality. In 1976 an experiment that throws light on some children's ideas about the wolf was conducted in Russian and Kirghiz schools, and it has been described by the linguists Vereschagin and Kostomarov (1980, 87). It appears that when the fable of A. N. Krylov, "The Wolf and the Lamb/' was to be dramatised in the Russian school, none of the children wanted the role of the wolf. In the Kirghiz school, on the other hand, almost all of the children wanted to play the wolf. In other words, completely different associations arose among the Russian and the Kirghiz children with regard to the word "wolf" (Krylov 1926, 40). In general terms, while a Russian is likely to conclude that the statement "this man is a wolf" indicates that the person in question is definitely a dangerous individual, a Kirghiz would probably regard such a person as being an especially brave man, an outstanding personality possessing such qualities as courage, fearlessness, decisiveness, energy and physical health (Isayev 1988, 61). This paper will examine other Central- Asian and Caucasus evidence of positive and respectful attitudes towards wolves. These present a marked contrast to the negative perception of the wolf in Christian cultures - exemplified by the children's reactions described above, and the indirect linguistic evidence given below - where the traditional comparison of the wolf with the devil, preying on the Christian flock, has long fostered hatred and fear of the animal. As this paper tries to show, perceptions of the wolf among various peoples can often be classed as being based either on fear or respect. Since the idea that the wolf ISSN 0015-587X print; 1469-8315 online/08/030319-16; Routledge Journals; Taylor &amp; Francis © 2008 The Folklore Society DOI: 10.1080/00155870802352269</page><page sequence="2">320 David Hunt is a fearsome animal is well known to most readers, this article concentrates on the more ambivalent and complex attitude of respect. Much of the evidence cited in this paper comes from the Caucasus. Since many of the ethnic groups in this region have been strongly influenced by the waves of Turco-Mongolian nomads migrating to this territory since time immemorial, supplementary material in relation to Central Asia will also be brought into play. Indirect Evidence of Attitudes to the Wolf Some indirect evidence of attitudes to the wolf can be obtained by reference to common phrases that include the name of the animal. These show general differences between people in Europe and those in the Caucasus. Common Phrases in European Languages that Mention the Wolf Some of the phrases involving the wolf, such as "lone wolf," merely refer to the behaviour of the animal, while others, such as the French il fait un froid de loup or the Italian tempo da lupi, recognise that the wolf is not bothered by bad weather. The word wolf also occurs in such phrases as the Russian "living with wolves, howl like a wolf," which could be seen to recommend compliance with local practice. From Harrap's French Dictionary we learn that the word wolf is used in terms of endearment such as jeune loup, and mon petit loup, mon gros loup. The Oxford English Dictionary includes various definitions of the word "wolf," mainly with negative connotations, such as: "a person or being having the character of a wolf; one of a cruel, ferocious or rapacious disposition"; "applied to a person, etc. who should be hunted down like a wolf"; "as a type of a destructive or devouring agency, esp. hunger or famine"; "a name for certain malignant or erosive diseases in men and animals," for example lupus. Similar attitudes can be found in phrases from various European languages, as shown in Table 1. Table 1.

Whereas statistics show that the bear is a much more dangerous animal than the wolf, the appeal of teddy bears has not been matched by a demand for cuddly wolves. Common Phrases that Mention the Wolf among the Dargva People of the Caucasus The phrases used in European languages as applied to the wolf may be compared with those of the Dargva, a typical mountain people of the Caucasus, as presented in Table 2. The Dargva live in the Daghestan region of the Eastern Caucasus, and, although they are considered to be aboriginal inhabitants of the region, they have been strongly influenced by the Turco-Mongolian immigrants in the Caucasus. In the Dargva language, the word betsivan ("like a wolf") is used to describe courage, decisiveness and fearlessness. These characteristics are also used to describe the young independent freedom- loving hero in some ancient Dargva Proverbs, which state, for example: "The food of the wolf and the food of the young hero are on the road" (that is, both are resourceful and get their food by hunting), and "The wolf puts up with hunger but will not endure slavery" (Urmancheyev 1978, 12). In the days of hand-to-hand combat, before the invention of firearms, the safety and well-being of the family or clan group was very dependent on the strength and courage of the men, and individual heroes (batyrs) were much admired. These same qualities of strength Table 2. Dargva-language phrases that include positive aspects of the wolf (Isayev 1988, 62-3).

Although there are many Dargva phrases containing the word betsi ("wolf "), as presented in Table 2, these are used only in a positive sense. If a man is characterised as having a wolf-like character in a negative sense, a different word is used; namely zhanivar, "beast." Pride in having a wolf-like character is illustrated by a description of a meeting between an official (an exiled Polish man) and the Kirghiz Sultan Barak and other sultans in the first half of the nineteenth century. Sultan Barak had just read out a splendid genealogy of his ancestors. The Polish official said as a joke: ... in vain do you take your family from such a lofty beginning; your actual origin comes from three brothers: the white wolf, the grey wolf and the black wolf. Your life is given over only to sensuality and gratification of the belly, which always recalls a wolfish origin (Yanushkevich 1966, 165; Lipets 1981, 123) (author's translation). Although these sultans were used to being respected and feared, they were not at all offended by this, and laughed for a long time (idem). Evidence of Respect for the Wölfin Folk Legends and Tales There are many Caucasus tales and legends in which the wolf behaves as expected; that is, as a beast of prey. There are also many animal tales in which the bear, the wolf and the fox typically figure, and in which the wolf takes an intermediate position between the cunning fox and the stupid bear. However, there are also tales and legends in which the wolf has a more anthropomorphic character or in which a man behaves like a wolf. Such anthropomorphic or zoomorphic legends are relevant to this study. There seem to be four separate but intertwined themes in the folk literature of the Caucasus and Asia that link heroes to wolves. These themes are hunting, stealing (rustling) livestock, fighting and sheep-rearing. In the first three categories, the tales and legends show that the man admires the wolf and wishes to imitate his success. In addition, the wolf is perceived as a supreme survivor, especially under harsh conditions on the plains and in the mountains. In the fourth category, sheep-rearing, the attitude is complex and ambivalent, and the relations between shepherds and wolves are discussed later in this paper. Legends of a Clan Primogenitor being either Born from a Wolf or Nourished by a Wolf, and their Significance Admiration of the wolf has often been explained by legends that claim family connections with the animal. Some of these claims may have been originally politically motivated. Lipets charts the gradual development of the relations of dynastic families with the wolf in the Turco-Mongolian epos: progressing through descent from a wolf, adoption and nourishment by a wolf, and, at a later date, protection and guidance by a wolf. Lipets claims that this development was the result of a gradually increasing scepticism about the supernatural (Lipets 1981). The oriental scholar Bichurin gives an example of a legend about the Gaogyuy clan, from the Altai region, being descended from a daughter of the House of Hunn</page><page sequence="5">Diverging Perceptions of the Wolf 323 (Bichurin 1950, vol. 1, 214). In this legend, Shanyuy fathered two daughters of extraordinary beauty: The grandees considered them to be goddesses. Shanyuy said, "Can I give such daughters in marriage to men? I will grant them to Heaven." And so he built a tall tower to the North of the capital in an uninhabited place and placed both daughters there, saying: "I pray Heaven will accept them." After three years their mother wanted to take them away, but Shanyuy said it was not possible, the time had not yet come. A year later an old wolf started watching the tower and howling, day and night, and dug himself a lair beneath the tower and did not leave it. The younger daughter said, "Our parent put us here wishing to grant us to Heaven; but now a wolf has come; perhaps his arrival is a lucky omen." She was just about to go out to him when her elder sister said in extreme fear, "It is an animal, don't disgrace our parents." The younger sister ignored her, went down to the wolf, married him and bore a son. Their descendants multiplied and formed a nation (Bichurin 1950, vol. 1, 214) (author's translation). In another legend about the origin of the Ashina clan, a certain Hunnish clan was said to have been completely wiped out by another group except for one ten-year-old boy. The warriors, seeing his young years, were reluctant to kill him, but after cutting off his hands and feet they threw him into a grassy lake. A female wolf started feeding him with meat. When the head of the victorious clan heard that the boy was still alive, he sent people to kill him a second time. The messengers, on seeing the boy near a wolf bitch, wanted to kill her too, but she sought shelter in a mountain cave and gave birth to ten sons. Each one of the sons subsequently formed an individual clan, including Ashina, who formed the Ashina clan and became its leader (Bichurin 1950, vol. 1, 221-2). Chingis Khan himself, according to one version, was "born from a ray of the sun and the grey wolf" (Korogly 1976, 102). Most of us are familiar with the story of Romulus and Remus having been saved from starvation by a she-wolf who gave them her milk. Some analogous legends have been listed by Dunn in his work on the foundling and the werewolf (Dunn 1960, 86-111). [1] Among Turco-Mongolian peoples in the Caucasus and Central Asia, there are numerous legends of ancestors being nourished or suckled by wolves, a theme that has a significant meaning in connection with local culture. Among all ethnic groups in the Caucasus there is a long tradition of fosterage. For instance, Prince Tuganov, who was born to an aristocratic family in Kabarda in the North Caucasus in 1881, has stated: When the sons of noble families reached the age of seven or eight, they were sent away to continue their education in the house of another family until they were about twelve. They lived the life of the children of the house, and the foster-parents were considered as relations of the boy's family (Tuganov 1936, 30ff). As a result of the custom of fosterage, a complex system of family and inter-family obligations arose, which involved sanctions to ensure that there was compliance with the norms of the community, or at least the threat of punishment for their infringement. Clearly, the lives of orphans would be in danger unless they had been adopted into a family for protection. The suckling of an infant by a wolf automatically meant that he had been adopted into the wolf family (clan) and could expect to be protected by them for the rest of his life. This is implied in the following tradition about the Mongolian Usun tribe, in which it is narrated that</page><page sequence="6">324 David Hunt when they were defeated by the Huns their slain leader left behind a new-born son: Gun'mo, who had only just been born, was abandoned on the steppe. The birds came and pecked the insects from his body; a she-wolf came to feed him with her milk (Bichurin 1950, 155). A more developed tradition in the Tien-Shan region of Central Asia tells that a certain nomadic boy who was unable to walk was left behind by his parents at the stopping-place when the group migrated. Then ... a certain man riding in that locality saw a she-wolf feeding the boy with her milk. The traveller took him with him and brought him up. The boy had hair like a mane, and he was given the nickname zhalduu kaba (" Kaba with a long mane"). Kaba was the primogenitor, the ancestor of one of the big subdivided tribes of the Sayaks. His descendants bore the name Ak-Teri ("white skin") and Boz-Teri ("grey skin") (Abramzon 1971, 286) (author's translation). There is also a legend among the Altai people of Central Asia about the infant Aru-Mandaya who was adopted by a white wolf, the "spirit of the mountains." The wolf did not nourish the infant with her milk, but brought him food (Lipets 1981, 125). The theme is also attested in a wall-painting in an ancient site in Shakhristan, Tajikistan, which shows a she-wolf with two infants attached to her teats (Gafurov 1972, 291). Among the Balkar (Turkish) people of the North Caucasus there is a legend about the birth of the Nart hero Yoruzmek. [2] The primordial blacksmith Debet saw "an enormous star with a tail flying in the middle of the sky, and it was brightly lighting up the whole world." On approaching the place where it had landed, he saw: a huge hole, and in the middle of it was a large dark-blue stone, which had split in two. An infant-hero was lying inside it. This infant had firmly clasped the neck of an enormous she-wolf and was sucking her milk (Khajieva and Ortabayeva 1994, 309) (author's translation). An old eagle described how the wolf had approached the boy to eat him, but he had grabbed her by the neck and had almost strangled her. Having overpowered the she-wolf, he began sucking her milk. The blacksmith picked up the boy to take him home. However, on his way he visited some shepherds, who asked him to let them have the boy, saying: "After all, having sucked the she-wolf, he has become related to the wolves, and the wolves will never attack the koshara (shepherds' camp) if he is there" (Khajieva and Ortabayeva 1994, 309). Another Balkar legend about the childhood of Yoruzmek describes how a mounted raiding party came across the boy sucking the teats of a she-wolf, and noted that: "However much the she-wolf tried, she could not tear herself from his hands." Yoruzmek tells them that he is an orphan who has no knowledge of his father and mother, and that the she-wolf has nourished him (Khajieva and Ortabayeva 1994, 308). In a hymn to Umay, an ancient Turkish deity, the Balkar claim that the sons of the Narts were the children of a she-wolf (Khajieva and Ortabayeva 1994, 582). An Ingush legend from the North Caucasus describes how the wife of the local chief was seduced in her sleep by a young Georgian man, resulting in an illegitimate baby boy. She ordered that the child was to be abandoned in the forest, but a week later a hunter brought him back, saying that he had found the baby lying on the ground and sucking a she-wolf (Dalgat 1972, 365).</page><page sequence="7">Diverging Perceptions of the Wolf 325 The function of a wolf in giving protection and guidance is mentioned in the next section. Legendary and Other Evidence of a Desire by Hunters and Warriors to Imitate Wolves The skills of the wolf are varied: the wolf is excellent at hunting, fighting, rounding up herds of animals (rustling) and surviving in the wild. Various examples have been quoted in the previous sections, in which men claimed, or were believed, to belong to the wolf family, either by descent or by adoption. Even among people who discounted these beliefs, it was still thought that wolves had characteristics and skills that were desirable for men, either for hunting or for martial reasons. Besides wanting to imitate the various skills of the wolf, the hunter, warrior or rustler felt that he could acquire some wolf-like qualities by wearing wolf-skins, or other parts of wolves as amulets or talismans. Legends and descriptions based on direct observation suggest that this method was actually used by hunters and warriors hoping to acquire the wolf's qualities. The talismans or medicines could include any part of the animal: the wolf's skin, his bones, flesh, tendons, bile, milk, and so on (Lipets 1981, 132). Among the Altai people there was a portrait of the wolf on the shaman's beads, and the shaman would address "prayer psalms" to the wolf (Gordlevsky 1961, vol. 2, 495). The Gagauz people of Eastern Europe had special holidays devoted to wolves (Potapov 1958, 137), and their unofficial flag bears a portrayal of a wolf's head. If the parts of a wolf gave magical protection and hunting skill, it was thought that the effect could be further enhanced by the wearing of a wolf-skin coat - something that also emphasised the status of the wearer. Older Svans were seen wearing wolf-skin coats with the tail at the back in the pre-Revolutionary period, especially in Lower Svaneti (Bardavelidze 1957, 45). The legendary Balkar hero, Yoruzmek (who was also said to have been suckled by a wolf in childhood - see above), usually wore a wolf-skin coat, according to tradition. This gave him magical protection against unclean powers, such as the shaytans - supernatural beings seen only by wolves (Khajieva and Ortabayeva 1994, 581). [3] According to various legends, when Yoruzmek turned up at a shaytan revel they asked him to remove "what is thrown over the shoulders" - being afraid even to pronounce the word "wolf" (Khajieva and Ortabayeva 1994, 37 and 356). The wolf-skin coat was also thought to protect the wearer in other ways. When Yoruzmek was invited to a feast by Nart enemies who wanted to get him drunk in order to kill him: Yoruzmek sat down at table without taking off his wolf-skin coat . . . [the coat] enabled him to realise that the Narts were intending to kill him. Consequently, he surreptitiously poured their alcoholic drinks down his sleeve. His enemies had also made incisions in his saddle girths before the [commencement of the] subsequent horse-riding games, but "his wolf-skin coat itself reached down and held together the slit places ..." [thus saving him] (Khajieva and Ortabayeva 1994, 334). The idea that wearing a wolf-skin coat could give the wearer wolf-like qualities is further developed in relation to the tradition of the hero transforming himself or herself into a wolf. In the Buryat epos, a heroine turns herself into a "blue wolf" in order to cover a large distance (Gordlevsky 1961, 495). In the epic "Slova ο polku igorev'e," Prince Igor wanted to escape from the Polovtsians but knew that their</page><page sequence="8">326 David Hunt horses were probably swifter than his own, so he changed into a wolf, who would "rush him safely to his native land" (Gordlevsky 1961, vol. 2, 499; Zubareva and Riasanovsky 1996, 74). Hunting. In many parts of the Caucasus and Central Asia, hunting was, until recently, an important part of the economy - the village or family relied on the hunter to provide part of its food. Hunting skill was important, therefore, and it was natural for hunters to observe other predators, scavengers and birds of prey, with a view to imitating their skills or possibly even getting guidance as to the location of prey. In folklore epics the wolf is often called "the master of the mountains, forests and lands," a designation that links his image to archaic hunting beliefs - such as the idea that hunting is traditionally controlled by a master or mistress of the beasts, who is often zoomorphic, and who limits the number of animals killed, punishes those hunters who exceed the number of animals allocated to them, and rewards others with success (Lipets 1981, 124). A Georgian hunting legend describes how Dali, the mistress of the prey animals such as deer and goats, had accidentally dropped her baby from a cliff. The hunter Mepisa saw a wolf running with it, killed the wolf, put the wolf-skin under his belt, and took the baby back to Dali. In gratitude, Dali offered him hunting success (Virsaladze 1976, 227-32). Lipets says that, among the Kirghiz, the game of kok bem tart, literally "wolf flaying," was originally a hunting game - being a variant of the widely-known game of kokpar, in which a number of riders attempt to carry a goat carcase to a goal. In the kok beru tart game, however, the objective was not to secure a goat carcase, as is now the case, but rather a live wolf, which was caught, released into the steppe and then pursued by the young riders (Lipets 1981, 132). Warriors. Besides hunters, warriors also tended to identify themselves with the wolf. In the second half of the fifth century A.D., for example, the portrayal of a wolf adorned the helmet of the warrior-king Vakhtang I of Kartli who, according to the stories of the chronicles, was called Gorgasar ("wolf-headed") by the Persians because of this portrayal. On seeing him in battle they began shouting "watch out for Gorgasar" (Bardavelidze 1957, 44). In the eleventh-century Uygur classical poem, "Kutagdu Bilik" - literally "the wisdom of royal glory" - the qualities of various animals and birds are enumerated, and the ideal war leader is compared with the wolf (Hass Hacib 1983, 115). There are also numerous accounts of the depiction of wolf heads on the military banners of various Central- Asian tribes (Gordlevsky 1961, vol. 2, 494 and 495). The banners of the Mongols of Chingis-Khan bore a portrayal of the golden head of a wolf (Gordlevsky 1961, vol. 2, 494), while the banner staffs of the medieval Kipchaks were crowned with a similar image (Lipets 1981, 122). In several epic legends, for instance in the Uygur legend "Oguz-Name," the tribe is guided on expeditions by a huge grey wolf that leads the way (Scherbak 2000, 18-28). The nomads often had portrayals of wolf heads on their weapons, even up to recent times (History of the Kazakh SSR 1977, 133; U. B. Dalgat, pers. comm., 2004). In an Ubykh legend from the Caucasus Black Sea coast about the death of the warrior-hero Sosruko, the dying man was said to have called out to the</page><page sequence="9">Diverging Perceptions of the Wolf 327 carnivorous beasts of the forest to come and taste his flesh. The wolf came first, but instead of eating him began to lick Sosruko's wounds. In response, the dying hero blessed the wolf, saying: "... may your heart become like mine! . . . But if you are unfaithful to yourself, however, may your heart change back into the heart of a dog!" (Kavkazsky Dom 1995, 60). This legend emphasises the local belief that a wolf is noble while a dog is servile. A noteworthy Ingush legend appears to retain remnants of a tale about the hero being suckled by a wolf, although in this case the hero mastered the wolf but was not fed by him. According to this legend, the sole survivor of the massacre of a village was a pregnant woman who was picking fruit in the forest. She gave birth to the hero and then died. The hero survived by sucking nourishment from his own fingers. When the wolf appeared with the intention of eating him, the boy thrust his hand into the wolf's jaws and broke off his fangs. Then the boy leaped onto the wolf's back, grabbed him by the ears, and rode him like a horse to the wolf's "master," who was evidently the "master of the beasts." The latter reared the boy and named him Berza Dog, "Wolf Heart." The boy was given a special sword with which he fought the ogre who had destroyed his family, and so avenged their death (Malsagov 1983, 138). Survival in the Wild. There are various recent associations between wolves and outlaws, both of whom are capable of surviving in a severe environment. In the Caucasus Mountains there are many groups of men who are considered outlaws (abreks) by the Russian authorities- many Chechen fighters, for example. The Chechens have been waging a virtually continuous war against the Russians for the past two hundred and twenty-five years, ever since their opposition to Catherine the Great's expansion of the Russian Empire into the Caucasus. What allowed the Chechen heroes to maintain their resistance was their knowledge of the mountains. In their life as guerrillas, the Chechens identified both with the wolf and with the eagle. One of their songs starts: "We were born on that night when the she-wolf had her cubs ... In the eagles' nests our mothers fed us" (Kavkazsky Dom 1996, 90). Another commences with the words: High on the hill The lone wolf began howling, I was listening and thinking to myself - The lot of the wolf is the same as ours" (ibid. 91) (author's translation). There is a Chechen tale about a cataclysmic storm that caused all the animals to flee and take refuge, except for the wolf. After the storm had abated and the animals had returned, they found the blood-stained wolf sitting proudly, and he said to them: The earth on which I stand is my birth-place, and no matter what misfortune overtakes me here, I will never leave it." The story ends with the words: "The wolf had no other home ..." (Kavkazsky Dom 1996, 135). Clearly, the composer associated his people with wolves, as fellow-warriors and survivors in the wild environment. Rustling. As the folk legends show, and as has been well documented (for example, by Byhan 1936), a traditional pastime engaged in by young men both in</page><page sequence="10">328 David Hunt the Caucasus and in Central Asia was rustling - that is, raiding and stealing flocks of sheep, cattle and horses owned by other people - and also the recovery of flocks that had been stolen. This pastime was facilitated by the availability of horses - in fact, without the mobility that the horse provided, rustling would have been more difficult and could only have involved theft from near neighbours, which would have been more dangerous than stealing cattle from outsiders. Descriptions of rustling raids (for example, in Khajieva and Ortabayeva 1994, 456-62) show that they involved a pack of young men who were mobile and prepared to travel long distances to engage in cattle theft. At the scene, some of the group dealt with the opposition while others drove away the animals. After reaching home the spoils were divided among those participating in the raid. What these young men had in common with wolves was that they hunted in packs, they were mobile and travelled relatively long distances, they made their attack in a cooperative way, and they shared the spoils. According to Isayev, when the wolves attacked as a pack, some would attract the attention of the shepherds and the dogs, while others would attack the flock (Isayev 1988, 63). In an Ingush tale in which the young hero is depicted as going on a horse- rustling raid with a companion, the hero says to his companion: "If I go in front like a wiry wolf, will you follow me like a wolf puppy " (Malsagov 1983, 84). Relations between Shepherds and Wolves A way in which shepherds differ from the rest of the population is that they have an active relationship with wolves as compared with the passive relationship of others. One of the primary concerns of shepherds is to protect their flocks of sheep from wolves, the main predators. The shepherds go to great lengths to achieve this, including keeping watch at night and having about five dogs, formerly including two wolfhounds, to help protect the flock. A relevant local phrase in Daghestan is betsi murulla dugi, literally "the night of a man [who behaves] like a wolf" - meaning a cold, foggy or rainy night, when it is more difficult for the shepherds to keep watch over their flocks (Isayev 1988, 62). However, their consequent close relationship with the wolf was not completely negative, but was much more complex. This relationship can be illustrated by various tales and legends and also by some of the customs of the shepherds. When wolves attacked the flock, the shepherds - despite their annoyance at the material loss - would speak respectfully and with restraint about the wolf, and did not curse him. In Isayev's opinion, the shepherds thought that: . . . the totem himself took the sacrifice, and one can hope for the fertility of the livestock and their health, the flock will be protected from the activities of harmful spirits, sicknesses, mass mortality and such misfortunes (Isayev 1988, 62). In direct speech the word for wolf, betsi, is avoided by the shepherds, with the word for "beast" being used instead, After a destructive attack by a wolf on his flock, the shepherd would say "Oag durzamlizi zhanivar abatsiib, sunela tsulbi aradi, darshaltsad maza ipalakatdaribnu" ("Yesterday a beast attacked the flock, may his teeth be healthy, he destroyed about a hundred sheep") (Isayev 1988, 64). The size of the flock might be numbered in thousands. A similar taboo has been mentioned</page><page sequence="11">Diverging Perceptions of the Wolf 329 by Gordlevsky as occurring among the Bashkirs, who avoided the use of the term kurd ("wolf"), using instead the word boryu (Gordlevsky 1961, vol. 2, 495). Another curious fact is that the shepherd was well aware that the wolf, by taking mainly the weaker animals, was also providing a cleansing effect, improving the stock and reducing the danger of disease (O. Mgaloblishvili, pers. comm., 2007). Now and then a shepherd would apparently actually wish for the appearance and attack of the wolves - especially when there was mass sickness among the flock after its arrival at the winter or summer pastures. According to the shepherds, when the wolf-totem had taken his share he would become a protector of the flock. If the wolf did not show up during these wished-for times, the shepherd would speak with regret about its absence or refusal to act as protector of the flock (Isayev 1988, 65). The shepherds had this attitude in spite of the horrific nature of the injuries inflicted by wolves, especially on the weaker and younger animals. [4] The idea of a shepherd sharing a portion of the flock with the wolves occurs in various Caucasus legends. The Georgian legend of Puldu Kaldan describes how the hero gave one of his sheep to some hungry wolves one dark and stormy night. Subsequently he met the wolves, who have taken on the form of men, and they offered him a gift of his choice. He asked for "the hidden knowledge that you have." They taught him all their secrets: "the voices of animals, the voices of birds, and even the languages of all creeping things." This knowledge subsequently helped him to protect his flock (Virsaladze 1973, 90). The idea of the donation of a sheep to a wolf also occurs in an Ingush legend about Seska Solsa. In this case the wolf promised to keep watch over the flock of sheep, which he did faithfully without taking any more (Dalgat 1972, 168). In a Circassian legend, the hero Warzameg helped a wolf to escape from a pit, not by pulling him out but by offering him a sheep, bit by bit, so that the wolf regained his strength. Later the wolf helped the hero, but after repaying the debt the wolf said: "I have paid my debt to you; think of me no more" (Colarusso 2002, 26-9). In an Adyge (Circassian) legend, old Nasran "is dressed in a wolf's fur cloak . . . He is given the best sheep to eat. All that is weak they lead out to him" (Colarusso 2002, 171). [5] The Georgian Svans respected the figure of the "sovereign of the wolves," Mamberi, who would tie up the jaws of the wolves only when he was pleased with the Svans. The Dargva shepherds also used a religious spell called "binding the wolf's mouth," which was performed by a mullah and involved the tying of several knots on a thread and the reading of a special incantation (Isayev 1988, 65). A similar belief existed in South Ossetia, where Saint Theodore allegedly replaced a local wolf-god but later became Toutir, a deity feared and propitiated by the shepherds; to him they offered worship once per year, begging him not to let his wolves take too great a toll of their flocks. There was three days of fast and other magical observances: Thus in one village on New Year's Eve a withy is tied round one of the columns by the hearth with the idea that this will sympathetically tie up the wolf's jaws, so far as that family's flocks are concerned, for the whole of the coming year . . . When the danger is past the string must be undone or the wolf would risk starvation and Toutir would resent it and take vengeance (Baddeley 1940, 126).</page><page sequence="12">330 David Hunt The image of a patron of the wolves, Tutyra or Totura, is preserved in the North Caucasus in the folklore of the Ingush, Chechens, Ossetians and some other peoples (Virsaladze 1976, 90). A similar master of the wolves has been noted in Croatia and Slovenia (Kraus 1908, 139). In addition, there were certain feast days - known among the Georgians as mgelt uktni ("making wolves ineffective") or mgelt kveraoba ("suppressing wolves"), and among the Svans as tkherob, litkhar or tkheremi lamprob with roughly the same meaning - on which magical actions were performed, incantations and prayers were said, torches were lit, and ritual bread, the so-called "wolf portion" gelo lagyar, was presented to the wolves. According to the beliefs of the Svans, some of the deities also had their own wolves. The Svans would address the deities with a prayer asking them not to set their "dogs" on them - meaning the wolves of the deity. Their dogs - that is, wolves - were also often mentioned in a Svan cursing formula: "May such a deity send his dogs down on so-and-so" (Bardavelidze 1957, 47 and 48). In one Chechen version of the creation of the world, God created sheep specifically for wolves, but man asked the wolf for the sheep, saying "I will keep them for both you and me." The wolf agreed to such a suggestion, and gave the man his flock. At the agreed time, however, when the wolf demanded one-half of the flock according to the agreement, the man refused his request. The wolf complained to God, but God replied: "What can I do? What you can get with your teeth, that will be yours" (Dalgat 2004, 177). Ceremonies Associated with the Wolf Of particular significance is the account of a custom by the f olklorist Bardavelidze, which he witnessed in the high mountain region of Svaneti, Georgia, where the wolf is anthropomorphised and endowed with human feelings. Here, killing a wolf required a ritual apology apparently aimed at warding off blood revenge by the slain wolf's kin: A Svan who accidentally breaks the taboo on killing a wolf would stand before the animal slain by him with his head uncovered and bring him an apology, believing that he had made a mistake, had not recognised the wolf, for he certainly could not want to kill him, in just the same way as he would be unable to wish to kill his own brother. Then he would lament the animal "as a member of his family" and, after taking off the skin, would bury him in the ground (Dalgat 2004, 44-8) (author's translation). On rare occasions a Svan might find it necessary to deliberately kill a wolf, and on such occasions the killing was followed by a seemingly festive procession of men, called Ashangelo or Shashangelo. The man who killed the wolf would lead the procession and would carry a long pole with the skin of the slain wölf fixed at its top. The procession would go round the village and would involve singing and stopping at each house. The people of the house would bring out gunpowder or a bullet and would hand them to the leader of the procession - a symbolic expression of the complicity of the villagers in the killing of the wolf. [6] Bardavelidze was of the opinion that this amounted to a ritual killing of the totem animal (Dalgat 2004, 45). The Svans considered wolves to have supernatural physical strength and dexterity, intelligence and sharpness, extraordinary eyesight, and the ability to</page><page sequence="13">Diverging Perceptions of the Wolf 331 avert hostile acts of men and to be able to foresee and find out about events occurring "beyond twelve mountains" - the distance a wolf would be able to run in one night. He was also thought to possess magical powers, directed at the welfare of men. The result was that a wolf-tooth amulet was thought to drive away evil spirits and the evil eye, while the eating of the meat or the fat of the wolf, or the communal consumption of a drink prepared from the broth of wolf's meat and bones, was thought to save people from various diseases (Bardavelidze 1957, 44). Such a belief was also recorded among the Kirghiz (Abramzon 1971, 286). Much of the evidence of ceremonial respect for the wolf, and the use of parts of the wolf's body as talismans or medicines, has been discussed by Lipets, who lists, in this context, rituals and beliefs concerning the wolf among various Asian groups, including the Altais, Yakuts, Buryats and Gagauz (Lipets 1981). He mentions two examples of cave sacrifices to the wolf, one of which was held in a "cave of the ancestors," where a wolf-bitch gave birth to the ancestors of the Turks (History of the Kazakh SSR 1977, 430). A portrait or image of the wolf was attached as a form of decoration to many items in Central Asia. These included portraits on the shaman's equipment, and the portrayal of the wolf's head on banners and badges, even those of administrative officials in Tsarist Russia (Lipets 1981, 12-14). Conclusions This paper has examined the question of popular attitudes to the wolf, and has asked why some populations regard the wolf with fear and hatred, while others have a more complex attitude to the animal, including respect or even admiration. Arising from the Caucasus and Central Asian evidence presented here, it would appear that there may be a correlation between the mode of life of the people and their attitude to the wolf. In the examples quoted above in which there was a positive attitude to the wolf, the people tended to live their lives mainly out of doors. Some fed their families by means of hunting, some were also involved in fighting or in predatory raids on other people's flocks or herds, and some were obliged to live like wolves as outlaws, surviving in a wild environment. It was also evident that the status of a clan and its leader could be enhanced by the development of a legend of the clan primogenitor as having been a real or an adopted wolf. Further conclusions were also drawn from the information presented in this paper. In the regions where the wolf still exists, there are diverging perceptions of the wolf and he is regarded either as an animal to be feared and hated, or as one to be admired and respected. A positive attitude to the wolf was promoted by an admiration for, and attempted emulation of the wolf's expertise in hunting and raiding, and his outdoor survival skills. Even shepherds had a respectful if ambivalent attitude to the wolf that took account of his usefulness in purging the flock of weak or diseased animals at particular times of the year. It is also clear from some of the quotations above that observers were impressed by the contrast between the dependent behaviour of dogs and the independent spirit of their wild canine relatives, the wolves. Whereas negative attitudes to the wolf may be epitomised in the tale of "Little Red-Riding Hood," that of respect is well summed up by an excerpt from the</page><page sequence="14">332 David Hunt Kirghiz classic "The Book of Dede Korkut," translated by the late scholar of Turkish culture, Geoffrey Lewis: Blessed is the face of the wolf . . . You, whose sun rises when dark night falls, Who stands up like a man in the snow and the rain . . . (Lewis 1974, 47). Notes [1] More information is given in a thesis by Caroline Oates (1993). [2] The Narts were an ancient heroic race that preceded the present population, but whose legendary heroism the present generations try to emulate. [3] The shaytan (perhaps linked to the word Satan) is perceived as being something between a demon and a fairy. In the Balkar traditions they were often thought to spend their nights in dancing and revelry, but disappeared at dawn. [4] Such an attitude is not confined to the Caucasus. There is an Inuit myth in which God had provided them with various animals, including the caribou, which had come from a hole in the ground. Eventually the quality of the caribou herd deteriorated and an Inuit woman complained to God that these animals gave poor quality meat and hides. God told her to go back to the hole. Out of it came the wolf. The wolf culled the weaklings from the Caribou herd and the quality of the remainder improved (Jessell 1994, 24). [5] Perhaps this is another example of the cleansing of the flock by letting the wolf take the weakest (see also the section above, "Relations between Shepherds and Wolves"). [6] Very similar beliefs have also been recorded among various American Indian tribes including the Cherokee. Kwakiutl and Ahtena. toeether with the Inuit (Looez 1978. 109-10).
