The striking way in which Woolf repeatedly and effectively turns the focus of her narratives in Mrs . Dalloway and To the Lighthouse to the nonhuman world invites an analysis of the relationship between the human and the nonhuman beyond the scope of merely considering her characters' relationships to the natural world. Broadening this scope of analysis to include both organic, natural life and inorganic, nonhuman materialities present in her novels will bring a deeper understanding to Woolf's vision of how all life and matter are intermeshed. Theories of new materialism provide a more object-oriented means of looking beyond the human and the natural in Woolf's works, which have been previously analyzed through an ecocritical lens, to fully understand all that encompasses her vibrant vision of</page><page sequence="2">Leanna Lostoski the modern world. In this essay, I argue that Woolf's rendering of the relationships between the human and the nonhuman in Mrs . Dalloway and To the Lighthouse embodies what Jane Bennett would call a "vital materialism a theory that considers the role and the agency of the nonhuman as well as the human in shaping the world. Recent Woolf scholarship has utilized ecocritical approaches to her works to demonstrate the significance of how the material and nonhuman worlds often rise to the forefront of her narratives. Writing specifically about the "Time Passes" section of To the Lighthouse, Charlotte Zoë Walker states, "With the emergence of ecocritical approaches to literature, readers of Woolf are becoming increasingly conscious of the remarkable and varied representations of nature in many of her novels" (144). Louise Westling also observes that To the Lighthouse specifically displays Woolf's "long concern with the nonhuman world" (858). L. Elizabeth Waller further argues that Woolf's writing was shaped by her understanding of the interconnectedness of the human and nonhuman worlds, which prompted her to experiment with narrative form in works like Mrs . Dalloway and To the Lighthouse (137). In this way, Waller argues, Woolf aims to represent the "real world " as she sees it: an inseparable mix of the human and nonhuman where the nonhuman ceases to simply be a backdrop for the human world (138, 141, italics in original). The 20th Annual International Conference on Virginia Woolf in 2010 focused on Woolf's treatment of the natural world in her works, and a collection of papers was published from that conference titled Virginia Woolf and the Natural World that explore a variety of ecological topics, like ecofeminism, plant life, land, water, animals, and the human body to name a few (Czarnecki and Rohman vii-x). These papers do address the organic, natural nonhuman world found in Woolf's works, yet they do not devote an equal amount of attention to illuminating how the many inorganic, human-made objects and things have the same level of vibrancy and agency as the natural world in her works. Derek Ryan has worked extensively with theories of materiality in Woolf's works, including his recent book Virginia Woolf and the Materiality of Theory: Sex, Animal, Life . Ryan finds, primarily through his reading of the following passage from "A Sketch of the Past," that Woolf truly believed that all things, human and nonhuman, were FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="3">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 55 connected: "I reach what I might call a philosophy . . . that behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern; that we - I mean all human beings - are connected with this; that the whole world is a work of art; that we are parts of the work of art . . . we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself" (MB 72, Materiality 2). Ryan continues to argue in his introduction that Woolf's works provide "new conceptions of the material world where immanent and intimate entanglements of human and nonhuman agencies are brought to the fore" (4). He emphasizes that theories of materiality are inherently present in Woolf's works due to her own theorizing on materiality in "The New Biography/' According to Ryan, her theory of granites and rainbows does the work of materialist theories to challenge binary structures as she considers the entirety of the material world (19), Ryan addresses materiality in many of Woolf's works on the multifaceted fronts implied in his subtitle; however, I find that his analysis of the sexual politics of To the Lighthouse does not account for a consideration of the materiality of the "Time Passes" section (88), Ryan does apply Jane Bennett's theory of vital materialism to The Waves, and I believe that vital materialism can be found throughout Mrs. Dalloway and To the Lighthouse as well As this brief overview of existing scholarship demonstrates, Woolf's attentiveness to the organic, natural world in her works has been well-documented and studied, yet her focus on inorganic, nonhuman materialities in her works like Mrs . Dalloway and To the Lighthouse have not yet garnered sufficient scholarly analysis. Ryan additionally edited a special issue of Virginia Woolf Miscellany on Woolf and materiality that addresses the growing interest in Woolf's vision of "the life of materiality and the materiality of life" beyond her relationship with the organic and natural nonhuman world ("Woolf and Materiality" 1, italics in original). However, while the pieces in this special issue address the presence of numerous and diverse materialities throughout Woolf's works, they stop short of reaching a level of analysis that considers why Woolf paid such attention to the material things in the worlds of her narratives. I argue that Woolf brings the nonhuman world to the forefront of her narratives in order to challenge the primacy of human agency in her decentering of the human and recognition of the vitality of all matter. To truly delve into the nonhuman world as Woolf does in her works like Mrs. Dalloway and To the Lighthouse, one must look beyond strictly FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 I VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="4">Leanna Lostoski ecocritical approaches that often only focus on the organic and natural worlds. Object-oriented theories of materialism equally consider organic and natural as well as inorganic and human-made materialities in their analysis of the nonhuman world. Jane Bennett's vital materialism is one such theory that considers all human and nonhuman materialities, both organic and inorganic, thus facilitating a more inclusive analysis of the vibrancy and agency that Woolf views in all materialities. Jane Bennett argues in Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things that we have been conditioned to view matter "as passive stuff, as raw, brute, or inert" (vii). Her goal is to advocate for a "vital materiality" of all matter that can only be recognized once the dichotomy of "life" and "matter" is muddled and intermeshed (vii). Bennett defines this "vitality" as "the capacity of things - edibles, commodities, storms, metals - not only to impede or block the will and designs of humans but also to act as quasi agents or forces with trajectories, propensities, or tendencies of their own" (viii). In this way, Bennett wishes to assert that there is an efficacy inherent in the nonhuman materialities of the world - an efficacy which has always, thanks to the dominance of anthropocentric Western philosophy, been considered exclusive to humans (ix). Her goal in Vibrant Matter is "to highlight what is typically cast in the shadow: the material agency or effectivity of nonhuman or not-quite-human things" (ix). Bennett s vital materialism provides a robust framework for interpreting how all kinds of organic and inorganic nonhuman materialities shape the course of Woolf's narratives through their material presence and agency, as it reflects Woolf's own vision of the world as an interconnected mesh of human and nonhuman materialities. This vitality of matter is most powerfully seen in Septimus's experiences of the nonhuman world around him in Mrs. Dalloway as well as when Woolf removes her human characters from the Ramsay house to focus her narrative on the nonhuman materialities that come to inhabit and remain within the house in the "Time Passes" section of To the Lighthouse . Mrs. Dalloway In Mrs . Dalloway, Woolf most strongly portrays the inter- connectedness of the human and nonhuman worlds through the character of Septimus Warren Smith, a veteran of World War I who is suffering from "shell-shock" that affects his perceptions of his FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="5">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 57 environment. Rachel Zlatkin argues that Septimus occupies an "inter- mediary position" between the human and nonhuman worlds due to his experiences in the war that have so greatly affected him (84). His hallucinatory visions and heightened experiences of the natural and the nonhuman in his environment sharply contrast the scientific views of the time on the relationship between the human and the nonhuman world. Justýna Kostkowska asserts that in Mrs . Dalloway, Woolf critiques the traditional scientific stance on the separation of human and nonhuman as well as the notion that humanity holds dominance over nature (186). Kostkowska explains that Woolf's critique manifests itself partly in her descriptions of human experience: "By referring to human experience in natural terms, she reinforces the inseparability of nature and culture, and shows their mutuality" (187). She concludes that Mrs . Dalloway specifically "portrays a world which contains no divisions or barriers between its human and non-human components" (197). Septimus's cognizance of the nonhuman world in Mrs. Dalloway best embodies this intermingling between human and nonhuman materialities that Woolf seeks to elucidate. Bennett's conception of vital materialism provides a theoretical framework for understanding Septimus's vibrant, and oftentimes surreal, experience of the nonhuman world around him. One specific aspect of vital materialism that she further defines in the second chapter of Vibrant Matter is her theory of a collective and " distributive agency," or the "the understanding of agency as a confederation of human and nonhuman elements," which she calls the "agency of assemblages" (21, italics in original). Borrowing from Deleuze and Guattari's theory of the " assemblage " as well as Spinoza's "affective" bodies, Bennett posits that bringing these theories of material agency together complicate the primacy of human agency (22-23, italics in original). According to Bennett, materialities can strengthen their efficacy by forming "a heterogeneous assemblage" that does not solely derive its agency from a human source (23, italics in original). Rather, the collective agency of these "ad hoc groupings of diverse elements, of vibrant materials of all sorts" is distributed across all of its parts, as assemblages ultimately derive their "agentic capacity" from the vibrant materialities that comprise them (23, 35). FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="6">Leanna Lostoski Bennett provides an example of the agency of assemblages by analyzing how a massive power blackout that occurred in North America in 2003 was able to affect 50 million people due to the collective agency that was distributed across the assemblage constituting the power grid: an assemblage she describes as comprised of "a volatile mix of coal, sweat, electromagnetic fields, computer programs, electron streams, profit motives, heat, lifestyles, nuclear fuel, plastic, fantasies of mastery, static, legislation, water, economic theory, wire, and wood" (25). According to Bennett, assemblages can be composed of and derive their agency from all materialities, even intangible things developed by humans such as "economic theory" and "fantasies of mastery/' This view of the interactions between the human and nonhuman worlds provides a means to complicate systems and relationships that have been traditionally understood as anthropocentric. Woolf's depiction of how Septimus perceives the world around him demonstrates the agency of assemblages in her attempts to portray the complexity of the relationship between human and nonhuman materialities. Septimus's recognition of the vital materiality of the world around him is clearly seen early in the novel when the motor car captivates the attention of the pedestrians of Bond Street in the morning. He sees "a curious pattern like a tree" on the blinds of the motor car as it stops in the street ( MD 21). Here, Woolf draws an initial connection between Septimus and the natural world, but at the same time she presents how Septimus's thoughts about the motor car differ from the rest of the pedestrians around him. Woolf's narration delves into the consciousness of the other pedestrians, including Septimus's wife Lucrezia (Rezia) and Mrs. Dalloway herself, on the street to reveal that they are preoccupied with determining exactly who of such importance is riding in the motor car, debating internally and with each other whether it was the Prince of Wales, the Queen, or the Prime Minister they saw before the blinds were pulled down (20-21, 23). However, who is riding inside the motor car and of what importance they are to the British Empire is not what concerns Septimus. Instead, he continues to be alarmed by his realization that everyone is focusing on the same object, the motor car, at the same time as he witnesses "this gradual drawing together of everything to one centre before his eyes, as if some horror had come almost to the surface and was about to burst into flames . . . The FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="7">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 59 world wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames" (21). The motor car in this instance has a vitality that Septimus recognizes as threatening, but the other onlookers simply share synchronized and simultaneous thoughts as they stop what they were doing and look at the motor car. Woolf describes the effect the car has on the environment after it is gone as having left a "ripple" flowing through Bond Street (25). She continues to emphasize the connectivity fostered by the presence of the motor car as "something so trifling in a single instance that no mathematical instrument . . . could register the vibration; yet in its fullness rather formidable and in its common appeal emotional; for all the hat shops and tailors' shops strangers looked at each other and thought of the dead; of the flag; of Empire" (25). Woolf concludes this description by stating that the passing of the motor car through Bond Street "grazed something very profound/' and I would argue that in this instance, Woolf has presented the British "Empire" as an agency of assemblages (26). Woolf 's use of descriptors like "ripple/' "vibration/' "wavered/' and "quivered" to describe the effect of the motor car points to its vibrancy as matter and its nature as an "affective" body. Furthermore, the motor car inspires the onlookers to think of all of the materialities - like "the dead" and "the flag" in addition to the car itself, the British government, and all of the British subjects present in the street - that constitute the assemblage of "Empire." Woolf demonstrates how these diverse materialities have conflated their vitality and agency to create the assemblage of "Empire" while simultaneously revealing how large entities like an empire only gain their power through the distributed agency of complex, heterogeneous assemblages of materialities - the British Empire being perhaps one of the most powerful assemblages in English history. As Septimus and Rezia walk through Regent's Park, Woolf demonstrates how he is highly in tune with the nonhuman world around him. Septimus's relationship to the nonhuman world effectively undermines human subjectivity by presenting the nonhuman as vital and engaging, rather than maintaining what Bennett identifies as the traditional division of the materiality of the world as either "dull matter (it, things) and vibrant life (us, beings)" (vii). Sandy Hudock argues that Woolf presents subjectivity in Mrs. Dalloway in a way that "decenter[s] FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="8">Leanna Lostoski her human protagonists and constructs] a web of connections between them and their environment, whether surrounding an official grey motor car in the streets of London, or walking through a verdant park" (240). Woolf presents what Hudock calls "visceral natural and human connections" between the human and nonhuman worlds in a way that brings the nonhuman world to the forefront, as opposed to the backdrop, of the novel (240). In one instance early in the novel, Septimus perceives that Rezia's hand on his knee is his only tether to the human world as he gazes at the elm trees in Regent's Park: "the excitement of the elm trees rising and falling, rising and falling with all their leaves alight and the colour thinning and thickening from blue to green of a hollow wave, like plumes on horses' heads, feathers on ladies', so proudly they rose and fell, so superbly, would have sent him mad" ( MD 32). Septimus's encounters with the nonhuman world of Regent's Park demonstrates Woolf's decentering of human subjectivity, as his interactions with the nonhuman are more stimulating and meaningful to Septimus than any other human beings he encounters. Septimus continues to recognize the vitality of the trees to the extent that he feels corporeally connected to them: "But they beckoned; leaves were alive; trees were alive. And the leaves being connected by millions of fibres with his own body, there on the seat, fanned it up and down; when the branch stretched he, too, made that statement" (32). Clearly, as Zlatkin notes, Septimus is unable to distinguish the "boundaries between self and object, body and mind" as he looks at the trees in Regent's Park (84). Woolf's description of how Septimus's movements are linked with those of the tree branch present Septimus and the tree on an equivalent plane of subjectivity, as opposed to simply an instance of personification or anthropomorphism. The previous encounter with the vibrancy of the motor car establishes that Woolf views nonhuman materialities as vibrant and affective, and the trees in Regent's Park have no less affect on Septimus than the motor car. Rather than Woolf presenting this passage as Septimus or the narrator imposing human characteristics onto the tree, Septimus, as a human body, is entangled with the nonhuman materiality of the tree to form an assemblage of human and nonhuman in Regent's Park: an assemblage of bodies expelling the respective carbon dioxide and oxygen needed for the other to survive. FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="9">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 61 Not only does Septimus recognize his place in the assemblage of the trees in the park, but his connection with the trees also speaks to the "trans-corporeal" nature of the human body posited by Stacy Alaimo. Alaimo focuses on the materiality of the human body and how this materiality intermeshes the human with the nonhuman through what she calls "trans-corporeality" in Bodily Natures : Science, the Environment , and the Material Self I She asserts that the vitality and richness of both "matter" and the "environment" have been "subdivided," "flattened," and "drained of its blood" in the name of human advancement and continued dominance over nature (1-2). Alaimo advocates for viewing humanity's corporeal status as beings as "trans-corporeality" to more accurately acknowledge humanity's relationship to the nonhuman and the natural in which the human is "always intermeshed" (2). She stresses that trans- corporeality is "a recognition not just that everything is interconnected but that humans are the very stuff of the material, emergent world" (20). Alaimo concludes with this statement: "By emphasizing the movement across bodies, trans-corporeality reveals the interchanges and interconnections between various bodily natures" (2). Septimus clearly recognizes that he is inseparably "inter- meshed" with the vibrant nonhuman world around him, and his recognition of his entanglement with the nonhuman world is intensified through his perception of his body as a trans-corporeal body. However, he fears that his visions of the vitality of the elm trees and the corporeal connection he has with them will send him "mad," since his visions of connectivity and agency contradict his understanding of how society views the separation of human beings and nonhuman materialities ( MD 32). In reality, Septimus is merely recognizing the connectedness of the human and nonhuman world that industrialization, modernization, and globalization aimed to sever in favor of increased human dominance over nature. Hudock asserts that Septimus's heightened awareness of the nonhuman world originated from his traumatic experience in World War I that has subsequently affected his relationship to the environment (239). However, since no one else views the nonhuman world as Septimus does, his visions are dismissed as "madness" according to Kostkowska (192). Septimus's radical ideas of vital materialism and trans-corporeality are dismissed as symptoms of his shell-shock, yet, according Zlatkin, his shell-shock is precisely what FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="10">Leanna Lostoski enables him to hear "those voices nationalistic culture works to regulate" (89). While in reality, Septimus is not physically attached to the trees by "fibres" in Regent s Park as he perceives himself to be, but the feeling of connection with the nonhuman world that he senses is the reality of the relationship between the human and nonhuman worlds that Woolf elucidates in her works. Septimus continues to sense how the human and nonhuman are intermeshed in Regent's Park as he notices the diverse materiality of the park around him: The sparrows fluttering, rising, and falling in jagged fountains were part of the pattern; the white and blue, barred with black branches. Sounds made harmonies with premeditation; the spaces between them were as significant as the sounds. A child cried. Rightly far away a horn sounded. All taken together meant the birth of a new religion. (32-33) Here, Septimus is cognizant of how all of the materialities of the park - human (the child), natural and organic (sparrows, branches), inorganic (the sky, sounds), and human-made (the horn) - constitute the assemblage of what is known as Regent's Park in that moment. His perception of the vitality of both organic and inorganic matter in the park is a way for him to understand his place among all matter, human and nonhuman, after his trauma of the mechanistic and violent horrors of World War I. Septimus's sense of the significance of the intermingling of these materialities is evidenced in his feeling that from these materialities a "new religion" is born out of the agency of this assemblage: a "new religion" that aligns with Bennett's vital materialism. However, Septimus's perceptions of the park are immediately contrasted by Rezia's as she observes the same materialities passively and dismissively as she continues to dwell on her own internal worries: "She could not sit beside him when he stared so and did not see her and made everything terrible; sky and tree, children playing, dragging carts, blowing whistles, falling down; all were terrible" (33). Rezia does not recognize any of the materialities of the park as having vitality, agency, or even beauty like Septimus does. She clearly feels that she should be the subject of FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="11">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 63 this environment, rather than the nonhuman materialities of the park, and that Septimus should be focusing his attention on her rather than those "terrible" objects. Due to her own anthropocentricity, she does not recognize her own place within the assemblage that constitutes Regent's Park or the vitality and agency of the matter around her. Septimus later discovers the "supreme secret" from his sur- roundings that deeply compels him to try to spread his understanding of the vitality and agency of nonhuman materialities to the rest of the world: The supreme secret must be told to the Cabinet; first that trees are alive; next there is no crime; next love, universal love, he muttered, gasping, trembling, painfully drawing out these profound truths which needed, so deep were they, so difficult, an immense effort to speak out, but the world was entirely changed by them for ever. (102) Septimus feels compelled by "the voices which rustled above his head" to tell the Cabinet of the supreme secrets he discovers, and the verb "rustled" perhaps points to the trees in Regent's Park as the source of these secrets (102). This aligns with Bennett's argument that recognizing the vitality of nature will impact future politics and policies. One of her objectives for Vibrant Matter is "to articulate a vibrant materiality that runs alongside and inside humans to see how analyses of political events might change if we gave the force of things more due" (viii). These truths relayed to Septimus do indeed hold potential political implications according to Bennett's theories of agency. Septimus's first supreme truth, "that trees are alive," strongly lends itself to a vital materialist interpretation. While trees are living organisms, Septimus sees them as vibrant living organisms that can communicate with him and have agency. If the Cabinet were to recognize this truth with the same gravity as Septimus, this truth could change the way policies are made by the British government in regards to environmental issues. Bennett questions if embracing vital materialism as a guiding theory in policy-making would "enhance prospects for a more sustainability-oriented public" (111). She also contends that FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="12">Leanna Lostoski vital materialist policies would have to include "more earthlings" (i.e., nonhuman materialities) as active, vibrant beings with agency rather than simply considering the human as the primary agent of change in the world (111). Zlatkin also notes that through Septimus's scenes in Regent's Park, Woolf is able to illuminate how "the land is not mute, and the wilderness is not contained" in her depictions of the vibrant life of all matter (89). His second truth that "there is no crime" aligns with Bennett's conception of "distributed agency" in regards to political responsibility. Bennett cites Noortje Marres's observation that "it is often hard to grasp just what the sources of agency are that make a particular event happen," and according to Bennett, it is difficult to assign blame to a single source due to the distributed agency of assemblages (Marres qtd. in Bennett 36). This line of thinking leads to her question: "But must a distributive, composite notion of agency thereby abandon the attempt to hold individuals responsible for their actions or hold officials accountable to the public?" (37). She further explains, using her example of the massive 2003 blackout, that "no one really is to blame" for the negative actions of an assemblage due to the distribution of agency across its heterogeneous parts: "In emphasizing the ensemble nature of action and the interconnections between persons and things, a theory of vibrant matter presents individuals as simply incapable of bearing/«// responsibility for their effects" (37). Bennett complicates the dichotomy between guilt and innocence in a crime due to the vitality and agency of matter, which in this way reflects Septimus's assertion that "there is no crime" if there can be no one held responsible. This is perhaps the most difficult "truth" of Septimus's to understand or to put into practice. However, I believe, as Bennett does, that it points to the complexity of agency of both human and nonhuman materialities - a complexity that Septimus at least partially perceives. His third truth, "universal love," loosely points to a greater connection to other materialities in the world that a vital materialist point of view would support. These truths are "so difficult" for Septimus to grasp and extract from the environment around him, which suggests their "profound" nature. These environmental truths of Septimus's were not so easily realized in 1923 when the globe was swept up in modernization, urbanization, and commercialization - let alone in the FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="13">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 65 modern world today. Septimus's vision of "universal love" may support a vital materialist notion that humans should respect and recognize the agency of both human and nonhuman materialities. These truths about the vitality of matter would change the world forever, as they have changed Septimus's world, if he would have been able to share them before his death. Septimus continues to watch the trees after they reveal their truths to him, and in this moment he is able to find "exquisite joy" and "beauty" in his surroundings when he truly looks at the "ordinary things" around him: "all of this, calm and reasonable as it was, made out of ordi- nary things as it was, was the truth now; beauty, that was the truth now. Beauty was everywhere" ( MD 105). Mrs . Dalloway as a whole carries the theme of beauty in the ordinary as a novel that occurs within the span of a single day. Septimus's recognition of the "beauty" that is "made out of ordinary things" in his surroundings is again a recognition of the agency of assemblages. To Septimus, the beauty he sees in the vital nonhuman world is "the truth now" for a man whose perceptions of reality were drastically altered by the war. He no longer has the capacity to see the world from an anthropocentric point of view, and Woolf's subsequent works that destabilize anthropocentrism suggest that Septimus's views of the world are not simply symptoms of his shell-shock. Her vivid descriptions of the world Septimus sees allow the vitality of matter to rise to the forefront of the novel. Septimus's suicide can thus be contextualized as a result of humanity's continued resistance to embracing vital materialism. Anthropocentricism is extremely difficult to subvert, and the world Septimus lives in, including his own wife and his doctors, refuses to entertain his visions of vibrant matter. Septimus can only see the world for what it is: full of intermeshed, trans-corporeal bodies that comprise assemblages of human and nonhuman vital materialities. His disturbing decision to tragically end his life is perhaps motivated by a realization that his vision of the world is unsustainable at the height of modernization. However, Woolf does not give up on her vision as it plummets out a window to the ground. In To the Lighthouse, she continues to advance her own vision of the vitality of matter. Only in this novel, she enables the materialities of her narrative to display their agency themselves in a world without humans. FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="14">Leanna Lostoski To the Lighthouse The short "Time Passes" section of To the Lighthouse is remark- able for its absence of humans and how the deaths of Mrs. Ramsay, Prue, and Andrew are confined to a few sentences within brackets that seem anecdotal to the rest of the text. Greg Garrard asserts in his article, "Worlds Without Us: Some Types of Disanthropy," that modernist authors began to experiment with imagining "a world completely and finally without people," and To the Lighthouse explicitly explores this kind of world in the "Time Passes" section (40-41, italics in original). David Sherman argues Woolf's stylistic choice to place the deaths of Mrs. Ramsay, Prue, and Andrew within brackets simultaneously represents and distances their deaths in the narrative "so that we are both present and absent at them" (175). Their deaths, relegated to parenthetical references, further advance Woolf's agenda to decenter the human subject in favor of the nonhuman other by representing the deaths of her characters in as minimalistic and tangential a way as possible. Through her narrative experimentations in writing a section of a novel that is not focused on human characters, Woolf is able to categorically represent the agency of the nonhuman by almost solely focusing "Time Passes" on the nonhuman in the Ramsays' absence. Westling observes that Woolf portrays the "energies" of the materialities left behind in the Ramsay house in the "Time Passes" section, which "plunges her narrative into the very energies flowing through the sea of being ... in which people are no more consequential than brief flashes of light" (862). She further argues that in "Time Passes," "the vast forces of the nonhuman world flow over and erase all the intricate structures of the human community" (860). Garrard similarly notes that "Time Passes" "is unprecedented in placing the house at the disposal of deep time and its slow, inexorably invasive biological powers" (41). Yet, Woolf clearly represents more than just the "biological" in her treatment of the nonhuman in "Time Passes," as she focuses on the many inorganic, nonhuman materialities that remain inside the Ramsay house as well. While Woolf clearly depicts both the organic life that has moved into the Ramsay house and the inorganic objects that were left behind as vibrantly material, the narrator continues to emphasize that the house is "empty" and "deserted," thus representing the narrator's - and essentially humanity's - inability to perceive the vitality of FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="15">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 67 nonhuman materialities. Sherman explains that the narration of "Time Passes" uses a form of "narrative insomnia" that supersedes the limits of temporality - past, present, and future - by existing in none of those times. He notes that the narration "warps time, creating subjectivity that voices itself not-in-the-present-tense, non-synchronously, as time passing or even surpassing the subject" (169). Sherman further identifies the narrator of "Time Passes" as a means of bridging the gap between the subjective, or traditionally human, and the other, the nonhuman. The narrator, according to Sherman, is able to show "the difference of others without subsuming them as the same" (161). In this way, Woolf breaks from the long philosophical tradition of viewing humans exclusively as subjects and relegating all other materialities as objects to redefine being in her more inclusive turn towards the nonhuman. Her descriptions of the materialities that remain in the Ramsays' abandoned house, both the organic that have moved into the space and the inorganic objects that were left behind, elucidate the vibrancy of these materialities and discredit the repeated description of the house as "empty" and "deserted." I turn to Bennett's concept of "thing-power" to interpret Woolf's depictions of vital materialities in the strikingly strange "Time Passes" section. In her first chapter of Vibrant Matter, Bennett discusses the nature of "thing-power," which she defines as "the curious ability of inanimate things to animate, to act, to produce effects dramatic and subtle" (6, italics in original). "Thing-power" offers a way to recognize the agency and materiality of nonhuman objects and to interpret Woolf's depictions of vital materialities in the strikingly strange "Time Passes" section. Thing-power also acknowledges the agency of the ostensibly passive object and recognizes its materiality and efficacy in its recognition of "the strange ability of ordinary . . . items to exceed their status as objects and manifest traces of independence or aliveness" (xvi). Bennett believes her concept of thing-power will "enhance receptivity to the impersonal life that surrounds and infuses us," and her hopes for the potential benefits of acknowledging thing-power parallel what I believe Woolf aims to accomplish by shifting the narrative focus to the nonhuman in "Time Passes" (4). Woolf's representation of the passage of time, as experienced by what remains in and what enters into the Ramsays' summer home, expands the temporal frame of the novel in FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="16">Leanna Lostoski "Time Passes" to depict what Bennett considers as a "long view of time" (10)» The agency and thing-power of the nonhuman shines through in Woolf's compressed rendering of the passage of time in "Time Passes/' and she expresses the experience of this long view of time when she writes, "for night and day, month and year ran shapelessly together" (TtL 156). In "Time Passes," human structures of temporality fall away as Woolf removes her human characters from the forefront of the narrative. It is in this absence of humans that Woolf can depict the flow of time as it affects the nonhuman materialities that remain in the Ramsay home. Throughout "Time Passes," Woolf juxtaposes the human con- ception of the Ramsay house as "empty" with descriptions of how many diverse materialities actually remain and thrive within the house that is merely empty of humans. The number of objects the winds encounter in the house - like "bare boards," "hangings that flapped," "wood that creaked," "the bare legs of tables," "saucepans and china," "a pair of shoes," "a shooting cap," and "some faded skirts and coats in the wardrobes" - make the house seem full rather than "empty" (149). Woolf continues to describe how even light and shadows inhabit the "empty" house now as well: "Now, day after day, light turned like a flower reflected in water, its clear image on the wall opposite. Only the shadows of the trees, flourishing in the wind, made obeisance on the wall ... or birds, flying, made a soft spot flutter slowly across the bedroom floor" (149). In this very scene, Woolf embodies Bennett's mission of "highlighting" the nonhuman materialities "cast in the shadow" by demonstrating the vitality of the very shadows that inhabit the Ramsay house (ix). Her depictions of air, light, and shadow among other materialities represent what Sherman identifies as "the narrator's empty placeholders for focalized subjects" (169). However, I believe it is clear through Woolf's writing that the nonhuman materialities of the Ramsay house are anything but "empty placeholders," as they are the primary focus of the narrative in "Time Passes." In fact, she directly undercuts this notion of the material as "empty placeholders" for Woolf's human characters in her deeply ironic descriptions of the Ramsay house as "empty" when it is in reality brimming with materiality. Early in "Time Passes," Woolf describes the ocean winds as they make their way through the "empty" Ramsay house and interact with FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="17">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 69 the things they encounter. As the winds move through the house, they ask questions of these objects in a powerful display of their vitality and agency. She writes, Almost one might imagine them, as they entered the drawing-room, questioning and wondering, toying with the flap of hanging wallpaper, asking, would it hang much longer, when would it fall? Then smoothly brushing the walls, they passed on musingly as if asking the red and yellow roses on the wall-paper whether they would fade, and questioning (gently, for there was time at their disposal) the torn letters in the wastepaper basket, the flowers, the books, all of which were now open to them and asking: Were they allies? Were they enemies? How long would they endure? ( TtL 146) According to Sherman, the questioning of the wind in "Time Passes" also reflects Woolf's reversal of subjectivity. Additionally, he notes that in general, subjectivity is declarative in its being, and "Time Passes" conversely presents the interrogative nature of the wind as a sign of Woolf's recognition of the nonhuman other, including nonhuman temporalities (172). This interrogative nature of the nonhuman materialities in "Time Passes" specifically applies to questions of temporality in how the winds question the duration of the existence of the materialities they encounter. The winds recognize that time is "at their disposal" as they investigate the Ramsay house in a display of their nonhuman otherness that places them outside of the temporality of the Ramsays, as the section will reveal that the times of Mrs. Ramsay, Prue, and Andrew have ended. The thing-power of the winds and all they encounter is evident in their endurance beyond the timeframes of the human inhabitants of the house, and in their absence Woolf can illuminate their vibrant materiality and their existence in an expansive temporality in a house that is clearly not empty at all. Mrs. McNab, the caretaker charged with readying the Ramsay summer home for human occupants after ten years have passed, thinks to herself when she arrives at the house, "There it had stood all these years without a soul in it" ( TtL 157). Woolf characterizes her arrival FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="18">Leanna Lostoski to come and clean the house as destructive, and Mrs, McNab seems to disturb the world created by the nonhuman inhabitants of the house for the past ten years when she is described as "tearing the veil of silence" (150), Walker notes that one of Woolf's most "compelling" engage- ments with the nonhuman is her coupling of silence with nature in her works, in which "silence mediates between the self and nature" (145), She argues that in this way, "Time Passes" is "a symbolic silence made of words . . . depicting both the passage of time and the impersonal power of nature to absorb human tragedies of loss and death" (145-146), The silence in "Time Passes," according to Walker, does not merely signify the absence of the Ramsays in their summer home (146). The silence of the Ramsay house is filled with materialities that may not make enough noise to break the silence that has descended upon the house in their absence, but Woolf portrays them as vibrant and agential in the absence of humans. Woolf redefines our understanding of silence through her narration that demonstrates how the silence of the Ramsay house is filled with materialities as opposed to simply an audible representation of the absence of humans. Yet, through her depictions of the vitality of the materialities inside of the house, Woolf has constructed a narrative in "Time Passes" that repeatedly expresses the anthropocentric understanding of the house as empty of any life in the Ramsays absence only to flip the narrative perspective to argue precisely the opposite: The house was deserted. . . . The saucepan had rusted and the mat decayed. Toads had nosed their way in. Idly, aimlessly, the swaying shawl swung to and fro. A thistle thrust itself between the tiles in the larder. The swallows nested in the drawing-room; the floor was strewn with straw; the plaster fell in shovelfuls; rafters were laid bare; rats carried off this and that to gnaw behind the wainscots. Tortoise-shell butterflies burst from the chrysalis and pattered their life out on the window-pane. ( TtL 159) Woolf's juxtaposition of anthropocentrism with her vision of vital materialism is powerfully rendered in this passage. It is through the FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="19">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 71 contrasting view of the house as "deserted" and the nonhuman life and vitality that fill the house that Woolf advocates for a decentering of the human in favor of recognizing the vitality of matter. The materialities in the house are portrayed as active things that use their thing-power to change the environment of the Ramsay house and reclaim the human space for the nonhuman. Mrs. McNab can be seen as a representation of humans who continue to view the world from an anthropocentric perspective and do not recognize thing-power, even though the necessity of her work on the house should be indication enough for her of the vibrancy of matter. After all, there would be no need for Mrs. McNab to ready the house for human habitation after ten years if nonhuman materialities had no thing-power and ability of their own to alter the state of the abandoned Ramsay summer home. Mrs. McNab is later described as breaking into the house when she returns a subsequent time, and Woolf also notes that she is "lurching] about" as if she is destroying the environment of the empty house (154). Her presence destroys what Garrard calls the "peculiar beauty in the disanthropic moment," and when Mrs. McNab hears that the Ramsays may return to the summer home after all of these years, she and Mrs. Bast work dutifully to undo "the corruption and rot" that had settled upon the house in the Ramsays' absence (Garrard 41, TtL 161). In reality, "the corruption and rot" is not "oblivion" as Mrs. McNab and Mrs. Bast see it, but rather it is simply evidence of the vibrancy of matter and the thing-power of nonhuman materialities that is powerfully illuminated in the absence of humans. Nonetheless, in a thrust of anthropocentrism, the cleaning crew tames and culls the nonhuman materialities in order to ready the house for the Ramsays to return as the dominant agents of the household once more. However, Woolf describes how the vitality of matter remains despite the efforts to clean and reclaim the house for humans. An "intermittent music" can just barely be heard in the house after it is cleaned: "the hum of an insect, the tremor of cut grass, dissevered yet somehow belonging; the jar of a dor beetle, the squeak of a wheel, loud, low, but mysteriously related" (164). Woolf ultimately concludes her depiction of the disanthropic, nonhuman world in "Time Passes" by asserting that the thing-power of the ostensibly conquered nonhuman world remains even after humanity has "ordered" the "chaos." Woolf even FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="20">Leanna Lostoski hints at how the nonhuman materialities of the house are, as Bennett considers all materialities, a "complicated web of dissonant connections between bodies" in her description of the materialities of the Ramsay house as "mysteriously related" (4)» Although the remaining Ramsays, as well as Lily Briscoe and Carmichael, return to the house ten years later, Garrard concludes that "Time Passes" is one of the first instances in literature where we can view "the world as it is when we are not looking" (42). The house has not "gone to rack and ruin," as Mrs. McNab believes it has, at all (TtL 160). It is perhaps even more vibrant in the absence of humanity's dominance. Woolf 's "Imaginations of the Strangest Kind" Bennett's vision of a vital materialism enables readers of Mrs, Dalloway and To the Lighthouse to truly see Woolf's vision of the world as an interconnected mesh of human and nonhuman materialities, all of which exist on equal planes of subjectivity and agency. Septimus's visions of the vibrancy of nonhuman materialities and the eerie vibrancy of the Ramsay house in the absence of humans in "Time Passes" shine with a brighter significance throughout both of her works when one can recognize Woolf's aims to portray the vitality of matter. Septimus's hallucinations are easily dismissible by his doctors and his wife as merely a symptom of his shell-shock. Yet Woolf clearly presents Septimus as a character who sees the beauty and the power of the nonhuman world and the agency of the assemblages of the vital materialities that comprise them, in contrast to a society that is losing its connection to the natural and nonhuman worlds in favor of modernization. "Time Passes" continues the narrative after its characters have left and ambitiously shows how nonhuman materialities have an agency of their own and a thing-power that endures in the absence of humans. In "Time Passes," Woolf ultimately deconstructs the human dismissal of the house as empty in a way that challenges our notions of what constitutes being, the self, and life, as well as what has value and agency among the nonhuman and the human in her depictions of the vitality of matter. In the preface of Vibrant Matter, Bennett asks "Why advocate the vitality of matter?" (ix). Advocating for a vitality of matter, as Woolf does in Mrs . Dalloway and To the Lighthouse, expands our understanding of the nonhuman materialities around us in such a FUGITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISMS | SPRING 2016 | VOLUME 49 | NUMBER 1</page><page sequence="21">"Imaginations of the Strangest Kind": The Vital Materialism of Virginia Woolf | 73 profound way that may, as Bennett argues, influence humanity to more thoughtfully consider how our agency affects the nonhuman present in our environments - as questions of the environment and the nonhuman continue to gain increasing importance and a sense of urgency in the twenty-first century (ix). Despite humanity's efforts to view the world from a long-held anthropocentric perspective, Woolf demonstrates through her "imaginations of the strangest kind" that there is an agency and vitality to the nonhuman world that can be recognized by embracing a vital materialist point of view (TiL 152). She ultimately challenges us in Mrs . Dalloway and in the "Time Passes" section of To the Lighthouse to expand our understanding of being so that the world may embrace the value of all kinds of vibrant matter. Works Cited Alaimo, Stacy.
