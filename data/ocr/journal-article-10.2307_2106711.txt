<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theonome Anthropologie?, Max Schelers Menschenbild und seine Grenzen. FELIX HAMMER. Der Haag: Martinus Nijhoff, 1972. Pp. xiii, 304. This book is very ambivalent in character. The author wants to write a critical examination of Scheler's metanthropology. To achieve his purpose he starts by claiming as the basis of Scheler's philosophy theological implications which are supposed to explain everything. In his view all other interpretations which consider Scheler as a phe- nomenologist and which prefer to listen to him before judging and condemning are just wrong. This holds even more for those who learned by a careful study, that there is an intimate link between Scheler's life, his phenomenological method, and the development of his philosophy. The author concedes that there is come kind of de- velopment by having one chapter on "Theomorphism of Man," and another about "Anthropomorphism of God," but actually, according to Hammer, Scheler was already an implicit pantheist in his "Chris- tian" period, never a real Catholic. Thus, again and again, he uses texts from the pantheistic period written after 1922, to illustrate Scheler's philosophy prior to this time. So his starting point and conclusion is: Scheler does not acknowledge the autonomy of man and world in his anthropology because his idea of man and world is heteronomous. Hammer does not provide his reader with an explanation of how Scheler is able to call God love and person, without knowing what the words mean. As a matter of fact Scheler wrote hundreds of pages in a phenomenological analysis of "person" and "love," but they are ignored, because they are not very helpful in supporting Hammer's thesis. Moreover Hammer does not appear to know that autonomy and heteronomy are compatible. Even though he does not want to learn this from Scheler himself, he could have learned it from Maurice Blondel, but unfortunately Blondel is missing from his bibliographies, just as some of Scheler's works (e.g., on Pacifism as a good contrast to his book on the German war) and some important publications on Scheler are also missing. Hammer also has difficulty in combining immanence and transcendence, or distinguishing be- tween religious experience and theology, which are quite different.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 299 Again and again texts are taken out of context to "prove" Hammer's thesis: Scheler is wrong. Actually this book only proves one thing: Scheler is right in saying, that you cannot know a person, unless this person reveals himself to you. But then you have to listen to this "revelation" in love and with sympathy and humility. An outsider will never understand. The ambivalence of the book comes to the fore when Hammer starts Chapter V. Especially from p. 219 on he really tries to under- stand Scheler, quotes him correctly, even about the autonomy of person, and does not seem to notice that from here to the end he continually contradicts what he has said on the first 218 pages. I am inclined to go into detail when I mention Hammer's preference for Helmuth Plessner to Max Scheler. Here I would like to refer Hammer to Scheler's opinion in one of his letters to Maerit Furtwaengler, about a certain heteronomy in a publication of Plessner's. But let us omit further details. The real issue is that Hammer's approach as an out- sider makes real understanding of Scheler's philosophy impossible. It is only the insider who understands, who may agree, or disagree and criticize. J. H. NOTA. BROCK UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
