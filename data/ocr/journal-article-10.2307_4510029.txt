<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XIX Recent Literature [99 1948 creatures that live in a marsh near Jackson Hole. The setting is a beaver pond, the day is the fall equinox, and the chief event that affects every one is the break- ing of the dam through the crashing down of the Osprey's dead cottonwood in the storm. The characters are a beaver, a mink, an otter, a Varying Hare, a moose; an Osprey, American Merganser and Trumpeter Swan; a trout, a frog, and even a leech, a snail, a mosquito and a scud. Miss Carrighar weaves her story skillfully; she enters into the life of each of these very different animals and without anthropomorphism depicts the interplay of instinct and learning. It is a fascinating narrative and one that adds to our knowledge and widens our sympathies. George and Patritia Mattson add much to the interest of the book with their spirited drawings.-M. M. Nice. 70. Canadian Spring. Florence Page Jacques. Illustrated by Frances Lee Jacques. 1947. Harpers. New York. 216 pp. $3.50. Another treasure of a book from the Jacques. In her vivid, inimitable style Mrs. Jacques tells of their great journey (largely by automobile, partly by railroad) to Canada in April 1946, first to watch waterfowl at Delta on Lake Manitoba, then west across the prairies to the National Parks in the Canadian Rockies, and finally north to Fort St. John and Hudson Hope in British Columbia, with the return journey to Delta in June. It is an enthralling narrative with wonderful descriptions-the Whistling Swans and Ruddy Ducks and WAestern Grebes, the antelope and Mule Deer, the mountains and pines and wild flowers. Mr. Jacques' sketches give the finishing touch of perfection. In her fine closing chapter the author writes: "I had loved this earth of ours as deeply as I was capable of loving it, and I felt content, holding close what I had received in return: a clear assurance of unquenchable life and joy." We, too, can have high adventure.-M. M. Nice. 71. Spring in Washington. Louis J. Halle, Jr. 1947. Wm. Sloane Asso- ciates. New York. 227 pp. $3.75. Our National Capital with its wild Rock Creek Park, the Potomac, Mount Vernon and the old canal at Georgetown is a wonderful place for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. The transfor- mation in the birds and plants traced from the first song of the Cardinal on January 22, 1945 to the sight of the last migrating Blackpoll Warbler on June 8. "Spring in Washington" is an inspiration with its keen, discriminating observa- tion of birds and trees, its fine style, and its philosophy based on fundamental values in life. It is a joy to look at with the distinguished sketches of Mr. Jacques that accurately portray the scenes described. The spectacular changes of the seasons in this favored spot are vividly and beautifully told by Mr. Halle; his book brings us awareness of the marvel of awakening life each spring.-M. M. Nice. NOTES AND NEWS Mr. Seth H. Low was transferred from his position as refuge manager of the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge on January 5, 1948, to take charge of the bird-banding program of the Division of Wildlife Research of the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. In his new position Mr. Low will direct the activities of the large group of cooperators who are scattered over the entire country as well as supervise the work of the central banding office at the Patux- ent Wildlife Research Refuge, Laurel, Maryland. He will be respons- ible for the interpretation of the immense file of data on banded birds, and will conduct investigations on special problems relating to North American birds which may be most effectively approached through analysis of the banding records.</page><page sequence="2">100] Notes and News Birid Bandig MEMPERS CAN HELP The general rise in price level has made it difficult for the North- eastern Bird-Banding Association to meet the increased cost of pub- lishing Bird-Banding. An obvious method of securing much-needed additional income is by increasing the membership in the Associa- tion. Members can, and are urged, to help by persuading friends and acquaintances to join. Prospects need not necessarily be bird- banders or people especially interested in this technique. Any person with an ornithological bent is a potential new member of the Northeastern Bird-Banding Association. Present members are also urged, if they prefer, to send names and addresses of likely pros- pects to the chairman of the membership committee, Oscar M. Root, Brooks School, North Andover, Mass. CORRECTION. In Bird-Banding XVII, April, 1946, page 69, in Miss Cooke's paper on "Returns of Banded Birds" was a recovery record for a Blue Jay supposed to have been banded at Orlando, Florida, August 12, 1942 by S. B. Fickett, Jr., which was found dead at Rockville Centre, N. Y. in December, 1943. Mr. Geoffrey Gill now writes that this record was so contrary to all other such records tabulated that he immediately questioned it and in the ensuing correspondence with the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service it developed that the bird was banded in Rockville Centre, N. Y. and was found dead in the same locality later. CORRECTION. In Bird-Banding XVIII, July, 1947, page 132, line 4, in place of Ardea insert Limosa.</page></plain_text>
