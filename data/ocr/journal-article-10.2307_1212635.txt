<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Bear Director: Jean-Jacques Annaud. Script: Gerard Brach. Photography: Philippe Rousselot. Editor: Nolle Boisson. Music: Philippe Sarde. Producer: Pierre Grunstein. Tristar/Columbia. Jean-Jacques Annaud has been both praised and criticized in recent years for his at- tempts to film massive, unwieldy, and what some have even considered "unfilmable" stories by re- sorting to conventionalized narrative frameworks. In Quest for Fire (1981) and The Name of the Rose (1986) he eschewed "epic" pretensions for the dra- ma of one or two characters in pursuit of a single (and deceptively simple) goal. In each case the thing sought, the secret which promised to bring light- literal as well as symbolic-to an age of relative darkness was, at bottom, knowledge itself. It might be tempting to try to fit Annaud's most recent film, The Bear, into just this sort of basic auteurist framework. In it, an innocent young cub is introduced to the mysterious ways of life by a wise, older bear, while a hunter who stalks them learns the life-affirming value of allowing them to survive. Thus, the North American frontier civili- zation, virtually built on the trapping and slaugh- ter of animals (not to mention genocide), gives way to a new age of enlightened, peaceful co-existence. As in the earlier films then, we see one of history's small pivot-points of change and progress, a quiet chapter in the story of humanity's advancement. Yet, forcing interpretations of this film to con- form to the context of Annaud's others, especial- ly given the diverse range of subject matter he has taken on since Black and White in Color (,1977), imposes severe limitations on our appreciation of The Bear for what it is. For despite claims, at the time of its American release, of its uniqueness and innovation, The Bear is very likely the most con- ventional film Annaud has ever made-his first real genre piece. Critics, however, have long tended to deny wildlife film the status of a full-fledged film genre, though it is an old and established form with a history and tradition as rich and diverse as any. The popularity of wildlife films on television has made them just the sort of thing "serious" critics have preferred to overlook or dismiss. The success of The Bear should indicate that the wildlife genre is creatively viable, and, more importantly, in need of a critical re-evaluation. Annaud has shown, as other film-makers have often discovered, that working within any well- defined genre need not be a constraint on creativity, but instead can provide a familiar "ground" against which one's own work stands out all the more clear- ly in relief. The idea, of course, is that this figure/ground distinction works because audiences have a tacit familiarity with the genre's conven- tions, and so are likely to respond to subtle varia- tions on familiar themes far more readily than to something truly unique and original, for which they may have no "language." Thus, much of what may seem new or original about The Bear stems precisely from the fact that it is, after all, old and familiar. Though the novel on which The Bear is based, James Oliver Curwood's The Grizzly King (1916), 30</page><page sequence="2">Daddy bear, baby bear: Surrogate family relationships prevail over biological reality in The Bear 7 '4 i!i..  ,, , . ,.i ... , .. .. ,,iVol " is virtually unknown today, Curwood's stories were once widely read, and a number of them were made into films both during his lifetime and after. Cur- wood died in 1927, but it was in the very next year that Felix Salten published his novel Bambi. Dis- ney's film version of this story is, arguably, the sin- gle work that exerted the most influence on the development of the wildlife genre for decades- despite the fact that Bambi was an animated film.' Salten followed it up a few years later with Perri, the "biography" of a squirrel, which Disney filmed in 1956, this time as a live action feature using real, though untrained animals (an essential difference from Annaud's film). The film version of Perri was oxymoronically advertised as a "True Life Fan- tasy," but it represented the culmination of nearly every narrative device and storytelling convention the Disney team had perfected in eight years of making their series of "True Life Adventures." Though these earlier films had been widely (and wrongly) considered "documentaries," Perri emerged nonetheless as the quintessential Disney wildlife film, and showed how far the genre had evolved by the mid-1950s in the direction of pure storytelling. Moreover, by focusing on the lives of animal protagonists, Disney effectively projected the nuclear family structure into nature. Partly as an outcome of increasing "ecological" conscious- ness during the 1960s (resulting in, for example, passage of the Endangered Species Act), Disney's highly anthropomorphic model of wildlife film- making fell into decline after Charlie the Lonesome Cougar (1968). Television programs professing a more "scientific" interest in wildlife soon became the norm. Yet as recently as 1988, wildlife film- maker Marty Stouffer has suggested that Disney's model, the one "devoted to the life story of one particular animal" remains the "classic format for wildlife films."2 It is this context in which Annaud's The Bear can be best appreciated. Though the absence of voice-over narration in The Bear is the most obvious departure from tradi- tion, some have been led to deny emphatically that the film has anything in common with the classic Disney model.3 Yet even the much talked-about dream sequence, held up as the true token of An- naud's unique and innovative determination to portray the animals' point of view, has its prece- dent in Disney's Perri. Though Perri's visually sur- realistic dream occurs during winter hibernation, the one experienced by Annaud's cub is the result of eating wild mushrooms. (They appear to be the highly toxic Amanita muscaria, incidentally, and nobody should be tempted into eating them for hallucinogenic purposes!) Yet, even here Disney is not easily one-upped; one need only recall the epi- sode in Dumbo (1941) in which the under-aged pro- tagonist becomes accidentally intoxicated, and 31</page><page sequence="3">hallucinates a frightening onslaught of pink ele- phants. One could argue that animation is another genre entirely, and that cartoons are full of animal characters whose points of view are routinely de- picted; yet at the Disney studios the separation between the two types of production was never clear. Ben Sharpsteen, who directed Dumbo, also directed the "documentary" film Water Birds (1951). James Algar, a sequence director on Bambi, went on to direct Disney's first two feature-length "True Life Adventures," The Living Desert (1953) and The Vanishing Prairie (1954), both of which won Academy Awards for "Best Documentary Feature." What all of this intermingling of novels, anima- tion, and so-called "documentary" film resulted in was the development of a set of clearly codified narrative conventions which survive even today, and which unite film-makers as diverse as Stouffer and Annaud. Thus, The Bear, like Stouffer's The Man Who Loved Bears (1977), a number of Dis- ney's films, and several others from around the world, wastes no time in making an orphan of its young protagonist. The matter of the mother's death might seem only an unfortunate accident un- til it is seen in the context of the entire genre, where it is typical. In some cases the use of the orphan device takes the form of a temporary separation, as in Disney's Yellowstone Cubs (1963) and Flash, the Teenage Otter (1964); in The Bear the death of the mother during the first reel completely elimi- nates the possibility of a happy reunion in the end, and so focuses attention on the drama of survival more than on frolicsome comedy. Though seemingly unwarranted, this tragic occurrence is also necessary to set up the "incredi- ble journey" motif which often forms the dynamic of these pictures' narratives. In Flash, this takes the form of a variation on the heroic quest tale: a foundling is set adrift on the waters, embarks on a perilous voyage in search of his origins, along the way undergoes ritual trials which initiate him into adulthood, and returns to otter society in triumph, where he is rewarded with a companion of the op- posite sex. The same is true for Charlie, the Lone-. some Cougar, and to some degree for Perri, though these two, like the cub in Annaud's film, are true orphans. In each case, an idyllic paradise is first established, then threatened or lost through the ac- tion of predators or natural cataclysms, and finally, ban.. ALt The Bear: The adult male grizzly establishes his dominance over the human who shot him after a series of trials, joyously regained. More spe- cifically, the nuclear family is reaffirmed in the end, if not completely reconstituted, and ready to begin the cycle anew. At this structural level, another break with con- vention that Annaud appears to make in The Bear involves his treatment of the surrogate family theme, though, ultimately, this too is guided by convention. Soon after the cub is orphaned, it meets a bullet-wounded adult male grizzly, and the two embark on their incredible journey together. Though we know from animal behavior research since Curwood's time that adult male bears have no paternal instincts or duties beyond copulation, that they often attack and kill cubs out of instinctive defense of their territory against competitors, and that a wounded adult male is the most dangerous kind, wildlife films nonetheless have a way of put- ting aside such niggling details in pursuit of a good story. What makes an "incredible journey" truly 32</page><page sequence="4">.......... ? ? : :;; i'4 A t ii: i:i:zi; / iil~ ;~ !ii incredible is, after all, the very unlikelihood of the companions and, further, the mysterious bond that unites them. In Disney's film of Sheila Burnford's novel The Incredible Journey (1963) the compan- ions were two dogs and a cat; in A Tale of Two Critters (1977), they are a bear cub and a raccoon, and so forth. In the classic model of wildlife film, narrative drives always override instinctual drives when the two come into conflict. Indeed, these stories can often be seen as para- bles of suppressed instincts, extolling the values of community and brotherhood among the animals (an extension of the nuclear family structure) espe- cially in times of crisis. Disney's films constantly constructed whole scenes in order to make the point visually: in Perri, a cataclysmic fire forces a skunk and a procupine to share a floating log that whisks them to safety together, while elsewhere a squirrel clings to the back of a bobcat as it fords the cur- rent. The lesson is that "hostilities" (technically not present in an actual predator/prey relationship) can be overcome, or suspended, when animals ration- ally face the neessity of banding together against a common peril. In the case of The Bear, that peril is embodied by armed human beings, making the unlikely partnership between the bears seem all the more necessary. Still, a question remains regarding the mother's death: why kill off one adult guardian and com- panion only to replace it with another? Many wild- life films actually do center on the relationship of a mother and her young through the seasons, but the particular narrative pattern that characterizes The Bear (journey, trial, struggle, etc.) is more in the line of a male outdoor adventure, and make no mistake, despite a brief "love scene" between the male grizzly and a passing female, this is an all- male film. Also, as indicated earlier, much of the drama in these stories comes from seeing the fam- ily unit sundered, then mended or reconstituted through struggle, sacrifice, and love. Yet there are other, more literary conventions at work in Curwood's story (which, reportedly, was drawn from personal experience). The fact is, for there to be a climactic confrontation with humans (an essential ingredient in the incredible journey narrative), the particular humans portrayed here need an adversary who is sufficiently deadly and menacing for them to prove themselves against. In such a scenario, there would be little enough glory in shooting a female in the first place, let alone one who is only defending her offspring. Yet the story demands that the mother be discarded nonetheless so that: (a) her cub is tutored in survival skills by an acknowledged "master" grizzly, one who shows supreme cunning and strength in "battle," and (b) so that the conflict with the human hunters can be played out as a traditional, primal struggle between warrior males. At this point, Kaar, the huge grizzly (played by Bart, a seasoned film veteran), takes on some of the mythic, totemic proportions of Faulkner's "Old Ben," in his classic story also called The Bear. In- deed, Curwood's original title, The Grizzly King, clearly refers to the fearsome larger bear, while Annaud's retitled version centers on Youk, the cub. One reason for this is that Annaud has taken a story from a different genre and adapted it to meet the demands of wildlife film conventions. Though 33</page><page sequence="5">Curwood's bear-hunter character allows his prey to live in the end, the story up to that point falls into the same basic category as Faulkner's, as well as Walter Van Tilburg Clark's Track of the Cat. In these, the totem animal becomes an open symbol onto which characters project personal obsessions of mythical and metaphysical dimensions, but in the guise of a profound and abiding respect. Then they kill it. When an animal in western literature becomes "the god of the wilderness," it will usually be worshipped in a most destructive fashion. As Freud argued in Totem and Taboo, this death does not serve to demystify the victim, but only to ele- vate him to a higher level of symbolic (totemic) abstraction-and further misunderstanding. The deep respect the protagonists claim to have for their victims, and the dignity they pretend to accord them, achieve their apotheosis in ritual slaughter. Though Curwood's resolution (the hunter's hu- manitarian epiphany in the story's denouement) reverses this, as well as the traditional theme of the heroic conquest of nature, the novel remains essen- tially a drama of man against beast. Annaud's film, in focusing on the cub's coming-of-age experiences, tells the story even less as a tale of masculine com- bat, and more as one of "education" in the wilds -for both the cub and the hunter. The parallel un- derscores Curwood's live-and-let-live theme, while the close-up drama of an animal's survival in na- ture remains in the tradition of Salten and, yes, Disney. There have been other film-makers all along doing interesting things with the wildlife genre; Sweden's Arne Sucksdorff and Canada's Bill Mason come to mind, though, like the others, they have been largely unrecognized. There are also a num- ber of structural variations in addition to the "clas- sic" model of which The Bear is an example. It is, after all, but a small step from Annaud's film to Carroll Ballard's Never Cry Wolf, and from there into the cinematic mainstream. It is too early to tell if Annaud leaves the wildlife genre behind having brought it a new measure of respect; certainly he has left his indelible mark on it, but whether this is enough to raise the general level of reception of these films from a vague apprehension to an en- lightened appreciation remains to be seen. Ulti- mately, while The Bear is inescapably a genre film, Annaud is anything but a genre director, and no doubt his next work will be characteristically ex- ploratory and provocative. D E R E K BO U S E Notes 1. In his book The Disney Films (New York: Crown, 1973), Leonard Maltin unproblematically asserts that the theme and format of Bambi actually "became the basis for many of the True Life features" (p. 53-emphasis mine). Though having Maltin's word here is not the same as having Disney's, the mere possibility that Bambi was the "basis" for films both Disney and the Academy described as "documentary" may be a case of True Life imitating art. Reviewers were quick to pick up on at least the sur- face similarities to Bambi, et al. Variety (Oct 7, 1953), for example, described one of the ground squirrels in The Living Desert as "exhibiting all of the charm of a Disney cartoon character" (p. 6). Time (Nov. 16, 1953) described the film's strong points as "vitiated by cuteness . . re- ducing the picture sometimes to the level of recent Donald Duck cartoons" (p. 108), while Newsweek (Nov. 23, 1954) also saw "a good deal of the cuteness to be expected from the Disney office" (p. 100). Bosley Crowther in the New York Times summed up the situation, saying sim- ply that the Disney team was "inclined to do with nature pictures pretty much what they have always done with cartoons" (quoted in Maltin, 1973, p. 114). 2. The entire quotation reads: "I think I will always be more inclined to film programs devoted to the life story of one particular animal. This is the classic format for wildlife films, and though I've never been reluctant to break the rules, it really is the most satisfying approach for a cine- matographer." From his book, Wild America (New York: Times Books, 1988), p. 219. 3. See, for example, Desmond Ryan, "Animal Magnetism," in The Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 29, 1989; also, Sean O'Gara, "The Bear" (review) in The Animals'Agenda, Dec. 1989, pp. 50-51.</page></plain_text>
