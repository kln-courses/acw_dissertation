<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Still living flesh": Beckett, Merleau-Ponty, and the Phenomenological Body Stanton B. Garner, Jr. Under mescaline it happens that approaching objects appear to grow smaller. A limb or other part of the body, the hand, mouth or tongue seems enormous, and the rest of the body is felt as a mere appendage to it. The walls of the room are 150 yards apart, and beyond the walls is merely an empty vastness [. . . ] Sometimes motion is no longer seen, and people seem to be transported magically from one place to another. The subject is alone and forlorn in empty space, "he complains that all he can see clearly is the space between things, and that this space is empty. Objects are in a way still there, but not as one would expect. .. ." Men are like puppets and their movements are performed in a dreamlike slow-motion. -Maurice Merleau-Ponty, The Phenomenology of Perception' Within a year of Samuel Beckett's death (in 1989), a critical movement was already well underway to reassess the relationship of his career to its twentieth-century philosophical and aesthetic contexts. Rejecting the traditional placement of Beckett's work within the "theater of the absurd," such books as Steven Connor's Samuel Beckett: Repetition, Theory and Text (1988), the collection Rethinking Beckett: A Collection of Critical Essays (1990), and Thomas Trezise's study of Beckett's prose Into the Breach: Samuel Beckett and the Ends of Literature (1990) have attempted to resituate Beckett's literary and dramatic canon within the theoretical milieu of poststructuralism and to find within his art an epistemological and linguistic critique closer to Derrida and Deleuze than to Sartre and Heidegger. As a result of this critical movement, what we might call the phenomenological/existentialist Beckett has been increasingly dis- placed by the account of a more radically contemporary, deconstructive artist.2 Stanton B.

Garner, Jr. Among these recent studies, Into the Breach offers perhaps the most conscious theoretical attempt to reread Beckett from this perspective, and its particular targets make clear the extent to which this critical revisionism has set itself, explicitly or implicitly, against phenomenological modes of reading. Discussing the shift from third- to first-person narration in Beckett's fiction, Trezise writes: [The] adoption of the first person bespoke. . an extraordinary intensification of Beckett's concern with the problem of subjectivity, and furthermore, came at the very moment when French intellectual life experienced the overwhelming influence of existential phe- nomenology, especially in its Sartrian tendencies. While the historical coincidence of these two developments may not have fostered a distinct phenomenological school of Beckett criticism, it certainly favored the pervasive association of Beckett's work with the ideology of existential humanism. And since this ideology derives from a phenomenological un- derstanding of the human subject, any interpretation taking issue with it must ask the basic and long-neglected question whether his explicit preoccupation with the status of the subject necessarily makes of Beckett a phenomenologist, and hence whether his mature prose genuinely lends itself to a phenomenological reading. The present study was born of the question, or more precisely, of the conviction that the phenomenological approach gains whatever insight it may afford from a conspicuous blindness to the dimension of Beckett's prose that signals the exhaustion or failure of phenomenology itself .... (4-5) Trezise tracks this phenomenology to its historical origins in the philosophy of Ed- mund Husserl, and he critiques its supposed assumptions through strategies delib- erately modeled on Derrida's deconstructive reading of Husserlian phenomenology in Speech and Phenomena (1967) and other texts of the 1960s.3 His reading of Beckett's prose seeks to establish the Beckettian "exhaustion" in these terms: that the unitary subject within Beckett's fiction is caught up in "the immemorial dispossession of subjectivity itself" (33), through which such principles as origin, identity, and in- teriority are subject to deferral and frlure, or "breach." Beckettian subjectivity, Trezise argues, is never given to itself as something distinct, unvarying, present; rather, it is displaced by the "already" of temporality and signification, invaded by an inter- subjectivity and by "the pre-originary impersonality of the first person itself" (66). Beckett's oeuvre-and "the subject of literature" as it is posited therein-must be understood in terms of "a general economy of signification that conditions and exceeds the universe of phenomenology" (160). This particular form of theoretical revisionism, with its attack on phenomenological models of subjectivity and perception, is, of course, a familiar feature of the theoretical landscape. Although the phenomenological revolution inaugurated by Edmund Hus- serl continues to make profound methodological contributions to philosophy and other disciplines, its application to the fields of literary and performance studies has been challenged-and, with some notable exceptions, largely precluded-by a num- ber of interlocking theoretical assaults. Semiotics has shifted "meaning" from the intending consciousness to signifying systems, relocating the perceptual object within the codified boundaries of the sign. Challenging "the metaphysics of presence," 3 Derrida's principal discussions of Husserl can be found in the following texts: Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction, trans. John P.

Marxism, gender and cultural studies, and other modes of materialist analysis have furthered the "depersonalizing" of experience by proposing that subjectivity is discursively constituted, a function of cultural, political, and socio-economic operations. On the artistic front, certain currents of postmodernism have extended this subversion of the subject through an aesthetic (or anti-aesthetic) of decentering and fragmentation. Perhaps nothing links the diverse movements of contemporary literary and perform- ance theory more completely than this theoretical shift in which the subject as ex- periencing agent is recast in terms of "subject positions" and consciousness is dis- persed within the field of the externally constituted. It is not my intent here to challenge poststructuralism as a body of critical practices, or to dispute the deconstructive reading of Beckett's canon, a reading which is clearly overdue and which has often brilliantly illuminated the play of Beckett's language and such signature Beckettian principles as deferral, dispossession, repetition, and absence. Rather, what I would like to do is to question the repudiation of phenom- enology upon which this poststructuralist/deconstructionist revisionism so frequently depends. For this purpose, Trezise's argument is particularly useful, since it renders explicit a set of methodological assumptions and procedures prevalent in contem- porary applications of Derridean theory. I would like to pause over its central the- oretical strategy-the rehearsing of Derrida reading Husserl-in order to forestall, in two areas at least, the closure implied in its dismissal of phenomenology. The first area has to do with what is admitted under the term "phenomenology." Through his almost exclusive focus on the Husserlian formulation of phenomenology, Trezise (like Derrida) fixes this tradition in its opening, most preliminary articulations, robbing it of its developments and internal revisions--in short, of its historical contingency, its literal status as "movement." Husserl himself stated that the phenomenological project was developmental: "We have expounded phenomenology as a science in its beginnings."4 The subsequent history of phenomenology has confirmed this assess- ment, as philosophers and theorists in a number of fields have subjected the models and methodologies of phenomenological investigation to recurrent internal critique, reinterpreting and often abandoning such aspects of Husserlian phenomenology as transcendental subjectivity and the "bracketing" of the empirical, pressing this anal- ysis toward fuller engagement with what Derrida considered the "torments" of phe- nomenology, temporality and intersubjectivity.5 When we consider the theoretical richness of the phenomenological tradition - the ontological problematics of Heidegger and Sartre; Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological hermeneutics; Gaston Bachelard's "poetics of space"; phenomenological explorations of the body by Elaine Scarry and medical philosophers; feminist appropriations of phenomenology by Judith Butler, Iris Young, and Sandra Bartky; the emergence of "life-world" issues in history, sociology, and the theory of technology; the aesthetic 'Edmund Husserl, Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology, trans.

Garner, Jr. theories of Mikel Dufrenne, Roman Ingarden, and recent reader-response theorists; other applications of phenomenological models and insights to the study of literature, film, and (in the recent work of Bruce Wilshire and Bert States) to drama itself6-it is hard to escape the conclusion that the phenomenology repudiated by Trezise is, in very large part, a polemical construction, narrowly derived from a single reading of historically limited texts. The phenomenological subject as theorized within Hus- serlian thought-a subject present to itself in transcendental ideality-is clearly in retreat in the writings of Beckett, but this retreat actually began much earlier, through the critiques of a phenomenological tradition that the Husserlian revolution had in fact inspired. As Hugh J. Silverman and others have emphasized, revisionism has characterized this tradition from the start.7 The second area where one might question Trezise's repudiation of phenomenology has to do with the theoretical relationship between phenomenology and deconstruc- tion, and the place of this critique within Derrida's thought as a whole. Derrida by no means intended a blanket dismissal of phenomenology; while challenging the "metaphysical" direction of Husserlian idealism and its methodological commitment to the subject's selfgivenness, the Derridean critique presupposes a role for such concepts as presence and subjectivity, if radically revised and purged of their priv- ileged, transcendent ideality. As Derrida writes in Of Grammatology, using language that bears more than a faint echo of the Husserlian project, "[W]e must . .. exhaust the resources of the concept of experience before attaining and in order to attain, by deconstruction, its ultimate foundation."' Deconstruction, Christopher Norris sug- gests, is "an activity performed by texts which in the end have to acknowledge their own partial complicity with what they denounce,"' and in light of Derrida's obvious and repeated admiration for aspects of Husserlian philosophy, it is possible to read a text like Speech and Phenomena as more deeply implicated in the tradition of phe- nomenological debate than Trezise and others acknowledge. As with Derrida's cri- tique of the structuralism of Saussure and Levi-Strauss, we must be careful not to 6 Bruce Wilshire, Role Playing and Identity: The Limits of Theatre as Metaphor (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1982); Bert O. States, Great Reckonings in Little Rooms: On the Phenomenology of Theater (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985). Space does not permit broader citation of the texts that constitute the interdisciplinary field of theoretical and applied phenome- nology; a useful (though selective) introduction to phenomenology and its tradition can be found in David Stewart and Algis Mickunas, Exploring Phenomenology: A Guide to the Field and Its Literature, 2nd ed. (Athens: Ohio University Press, 1990). 7 Silverman claims that phenomenology today is in its "fifth wave," as contemporary phenome- nologists reexamine the discipline's achievements and assess its opportunities and limitations in the light of recent theoretical currents; see Hugh J. Silverman, "Phenomenology," Social Research 47 (1980): 704-20. Husserl's own career, it should be pointed out, was itself subject to development and self-revision. Anticipating later directions in phenomenology, Husserl turned in the works of his final years (notably The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology [written 1934- 37; published 1954]) from transcendental consciousness to the more experientially grounded "life- world" [Lebenswelt], a concept that would prove central to subsequent phenomenology. 8 Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, trans.

This is not the place to explore the intricate relationship of Beckett's literature to the post-Husserlian philosophy of Heidegger and Sartre; such explorations have been ably conducted by others.11 Rather, I would like to set Beckett in a different philosophical context: that of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, a less often considered "second generation" phenomenology whose writings-in- cluding his most widely known work, The Phenomenology of Perception (1945)--center on corporeality and the "embodiedness" of consciousness. This concern with the body, in its problematic facticity, led Merleau-Ponty (between the 1930s and his death in 1961) to an understanding of subjectivity that resonates powerfully in terms of Beckett's work. I propose to read Beckett in the light of Merleau-Ponty (and Merleau- Ponty in the light of Beckett) in order to suggest that Beckett's drama explores and radicalizes an approach to the body similar to that of his philosophical contemporary, and that these concerns informed and structured his texts throughout his career. Like the history of phenomenology itself, Beckett's work represents an evolving and increasingly complex response to a set of essentially phenomenological questions concerning subjectivity, embodiedness, and perception. By foregrounding the body as the ambiguous site of subjectivity, the tradition of post-Husserlian phenomenology inaugurated by Merleau-Ponty presents the critic of Beckett's plays with a corporeal problematics different from (though complemen- tary to) the more familiar linguistic/textual problematics of poststructuralism. That The Phenomenology of Perception, like Merleau-Ponty's other writings, is characterized by a striking number of theatrical metaphors suggests the specific relevance of these questions to that staging of embodiment we call "theatre." To think in these terms is to confront, by contrast, the marginalization of the theatre within those studies of Beckett that seek to replace phenomenological with deconstructive models of reading.12 The frequent neglect of the drama evident in these studies suggests a latent 10 "Derrida is as far from 'rejecting' Husserl as he is from simply dismissing the linguistics of Saussure or the structuralist anthropology of Levi-Strauss" (Norris, Deconstruction: Theory and Practice, 48). Robert Sokolowski argues that Derrida's own use of language presupposes the phenomenological categories he challenges, and that the mutual inherence of absence and presence in Husserl's theory of perception anticipates in some ways Derrida's attack on the notion of presence as pure givenness.

Garner, Jr. bias of the deconstructive approach with important consequences for drama and performance studies-a scriptocentrism that, deriving from deconstruction's lin- guistic and textual interests, may also condition (and limit) its field of inquiry. Re- opening phenomenological lines of investigation allows us to redress the current of antitheatricality that runs through much poststructuralist criticism, an attitude symp- tomatic (like all antitheatricality) of a deeper uneasiness with the body--in this case, with the body as a site of corporeal and subjective elements that always resist re- duction to the merely textual. By reclaiming the body for philosophy, in other words, phenomenology has rele- vance, not only for Beckett's plays, but for non-Beckettian dramatic texts and for theatre studies in general. Phenomenology offers a way of re-embodying the discourse of theatre, as it has done within the other disciplines where it has found a place.13 Phenomenology is the study of givenness (the Greek phainomenon derives from phainein, to show), of the world as it is lived rather than the world as it is objectified, abstracted, and conceptualized. By calling for a return to "the things themselves" (die Sachen selbst), Husserl sought to ground logic, the sciences, and philosophy itself within the structures of experience from which these disciplines had abstracted their fields of observation. The phenomenological revolution, in essence, involved a shift in positionality, whereby the descriptions of a detached observer "posited" in front of its object would yield ground to an account of consciousness and its objects as these exist within a field of mutual inherence. Such a shift entails profound recon- ceptualizations; the essentially analytic space of Euclidian geometry, Cartesian phi- losophy, or Newtonian physics is very different, for instance, from lived, or inhabited, spatiality, with its perceptual contours and structures of orientation. Husserl's own methodological procedures carried this revolution in a direction that subsequent phenomenologists have often strongly resisted. Husserl defined consciousness as intentional ("All consciousness is consciousness of something") and thus situated subjectivity inextricably in relation to the world. At the same time, his pursuit of phenomenological "essences" led him to employ the phenomenological epoche (or "reduction") to bracket off the empirical world, with the result that Hus- serlian consciousness tends toward a privileged, transcendental ideality. Among those elements of the empirical world "bracketed" from consideration by Husserl is the human body in all its material facticity. Merleau-Ponty's revision of Husserlian idealism involved returning the body to the field of subjectivity. Whereas Husserl's phenomenology suspends the materiality of an "outside" that includes the body for the sake of ideal self-presence, Merleau-Ponty posited a consciousness caught up in the ambiguity of corporeality, directed toward a world of which it is inextricably and materially a part. "To perceive is to render oneself present to something through the body," he wrote; "Consciousness is being-towards-the-thing through the interme- 13 For a phenomenological approach to contemporary political theater, see Stanton B.

Rather than discounting the body as an accidental feature of the subject-object re- lationship, he considered the body "our general medium for having a world" (146) and defined the task of philosophy as follows: "to ... restore to things their concrete physiognomy, to organisms their individual ways of dealing with the world, and to subjectivity its inherence in history" (57). The Phenomenology of Perception explores this phenomenology at its fundamental level: the embodied subject's opening, through perception, upon the world, others, and itself.15 Using terminology introduced earlier in the phenomenological tradition, we might say that Merleau-Ponty replaced Kbrper (the body as it is given to external observation, the "thing body") by Leib (the body as it is experienced, the "lived body"), and that he turned the attention of phenomenology to Leiblichkeit, or "lived bodiliness."16 In so doing, he opened a field of investigation with obvious pertinence to Beckett's theatre. Pierre Chabert has described this theatre in terms evocative of Merleau- Ponty: [O]ne must understand [Beckett's theatre] as a deliberate and intense effort to make the body come to light, to give the body its full weight, dimension, and its physical presence ... to construct a physical and sensory space, filled with the presence of the body, to affirm . . . a space invested by the body.17 Beckett's is an intensely embodied theatre, both in the traditional sense that its characters are bodied forth by actors for spectatorial consumption and in a more deeply phenomenological sense in which Beckett foregrounds the corporeality of actor and character within his stage's exacting field. Didi and Gogo explore the boundaries of their stage environment (as do Hamm and Clov); they gnaw turnips, carrots, and chicken bones; they urinate, register each other's smells, yield to fatigue in sleep. Specimens of Homo erectus, they contemplate erections ("[w]ith all that follows")18 yet struggle to maintain a standing posture against gravity's downward draw. Waiting for Godot combines the physicality of slapstick with metaphysical re- flection, yet even the latter is drawn toward bodily metaphor: crucifixion, blindness, the pains of childbirth. In "Samuel Beckett, or 'Presence' in the Theatre," an essay frequently cited in traditional accounts of the "existentialist Beckett," Alain Robbe-Grillet discusses the unprecedented quality of "being there" in Beckett's theatre, and it would be possible 4 Maurice Merleau-Ponty, "The Primacy of Perception," trans.

Garner, Jr. merely to supplement this reading by focusing on the simple (and obvious) fact of bodily sentience within Beckett's dramatic world.19 Yet merely to note that the body constitutes a unique "presence" within Beckett's theatre is to ignore the problematic status of this term as it has been disclosed by poststructuralism and to reopen the phenomenological approach to the critique mounted by Trezise and others. Such an attempt would also force one to ignore the radical complications of corporeal self- presence that characterize Beckett's staging of the body, complications that were well underway by the time of Robbe-Grillet's essay (1963) and that continued to multiply and deepen throughout the playwright's dramatic career. Already in Happy Days, the body has succumbed to the fragmentation that will characterize the late plays: the play's staging reduces character to body region and body part (Winnie's upper torso, then head; Willie's head, arm), and Beckett's directions underscore this dis- memberment through language that subverts the impression of bodily unity and corporeal agency: "Happy expression off," "Head up," "Impatience of fingers."20 In Play, sensory environment has given way to an indeterminate, quasi-abstract space acti- vated by stage lighting, though this radical dephysicalization is already anticipated by the nearly bare playing area of Godot and the disembodied space that Beckett had begun exploring in the medium of radio. In one of those literalized metaphors of which Beckett was so fond, the image of Winnie buried in a mound in Happy Days parodies the very idea of the body "grounded" in its world. By the time of such late works as Not I, Footfalls, and What Where, the body has become almost a ghost of itself, reduced and decentered within the minimal space it has left, doubled by words that both address and disown it. Invaded on all sides by an irremediable absence, its very presence to itself is no longer secure. In Connor's words, "Beckett's plays resist the notion of the innocent self-evidence of the body and its language."21 As Hamm says, both contemplating and anticipating this scene of non-presence, "I was never there."22 Yet one need not move beyond Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of the body to find similar questioning of unitary presence and innocent self-evidence, or to locate the corporeal problematics that Beckettian theatre puts into play. A passage from The Phenomenology reflects both Merleau-Ponty's debt to the Husserlian project and the profound distance between Husserl's idealism and his own philosophy of corporeal immersion: In so far as we believe in the world's past, in the physical world, in "stimuli," in the organism as our books depict it, it is first of all because we have present at this moment to us a perceptual field, a surface in contact with the world, a permanent rootedness in it, and because the world ceaselessly assails and beleaguers subjectivity as waves wash around a wreck on the shore. (207) The metaphoric content of this passage reflects the epistemological/ontological par- adox that animates Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of bodied subjectivity.

But this material ground- ing also works, as the passage makes clear, to "assail" or dispossess the subjectivity thereby embodied. Since the body is both subject and object-as I can verify (to employ a Merleau-Pontean example) by touching one hand with the other-the subject's experience is caught up in ambiguity, in the impossibility of transcendental self-possession: the body I touch never coincides with the body that touches. As Gary Brent Madison expresses it: "Even though the body can turn back on itself, take itself for its own proper object and in this way accomplish a kind of reflection, it never succeeds in coinciding with itself. This circularity never results in an identity.'"23 As a corollary to this noncoincidence, perception is also characterized by a pre- subjective level of involvement with the world of things, an entanglement with the "non-self" which subjectivity presupposes and upon which it is contingent. "[T]here is always some degree of depersonalization at the heart of consciousness" (137): rooted in a body which it both is and is not, subjectivity confronts a presubjective field in which it is grounded but which both eludes and invades it. "The perceiving subject," as Merleau-Ponty says (in an uncanny anticipation of Happy Days), is "the anonymous one [that is] buried in the world, and that has not yet traced its path."24 In The Phenomenology of Perception he writes: "What enables us to center our existence is also what prevents us from centering it completely, and the anonymity of the body is inseparably both freedom and servitude" (85). Pressured by this experiential am- bigui't, Merleau-Ponty's language oscillates between a discourse of belonging and an equally pronounced discourse of subversion and contingency, whereby subjec- tivity becomes both that point from which the world arises into meaning and the seat of non-coincidence, "that gap which we ourselves are" (207). If the term "gap" evokes a play like Not I, with its "god-forsaken hole" that speaks its fragments of a life from a void of quasi-embodiment, this is because Merleau- Ponty's analysis outlines a corporeal paradox that Beckett's Mouth carries to its extremes. From the physical harshness of Godot, with its hunger, its bodily smells, its uncomfortable boots, and its irresistible gravity; through Happy Days, with its corporeal imprisonment and its failures of what Bachelard calls "nesting"25 to the simultaneously bodied and disembodied spaces of the late plays-Beckett's drama explores the instability between a profound material inherence in the physical body and a corresponding alienation, and it dramatizes the subject's futile pursuit of any means for overcoming its own non-coincidence. The diminished figures of late Beckett (like Mouth), seemingly abstracted from the conditions of materiality and embodi- ment, continue to play out this fearful ambiguity of corporeal self-presence, the urgent flight from a subjectivity that represents the impossibility of its own identity. The fact that the body seems to recede in plays like Not I and That Time-that it is fragmented, decentered, often deanimated, and that many of its regions are char- acterized by absence-does not obscure its place in the play of ambiguity and dis- possession. "Whole body like gone," Mouth intones, in a stream of discourse that 23 Gary Brent Madison, The Phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty (Athens: Ohio University Press, 1981), 25. 24 Maurice Merleau-Ponty, The Visible and the Invisible, ed.

Garner, Jr. seems to come less from individual vocal cords than from the darkness that surrounds it and onto which it opens.26 Yet while the body may seem to approach its vanishing point within a realm of the purely verbal, the qualified "like gone" precludes this disappearance. Lips continue to move in tandem with the words of Mouth's mon- ologue, and these words are themselves charged with corporeal references. Like the unspoken "I," which makes itself felt in the very energy with which it is avoided, the body asserts itself as a primary field for the play of phenomenological presence and absence and the endlessly deferred moment of self-coincidence. The opening words of Beckett's tribute to Avigdor Arikha echo the dilemmas of embodiment that characters like Mouth share with the Merleau-Pontean subject: "Siege laid again to the impregnable without. Eye and hand fevering after the unself."27 If Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology calls into focus a specifically corporeal dynamic at work in Beckett's handling of subjectivity, it is equally true that Beckett's late plays suggest the radical implications of this dynamic. The Phenomenology of Perception, as I have suggested, hinges on a paradox of grounding and dispossession, managing to bridge both the Husserlian foundations it recalls and the even more deeply non- Husserlian directions it anticipates. Beckett's drama pursues these directions, in ways that parallel the work of more recent phenomenologists of the body who have revised the philosophy of corporeality inherited from Merleau-Ponty. Herbert Pliigge, for example, has reconsidered the phenomenological distinction between Leib and Kirper in light of the experience of illness. Anticipating Scarry's study of the body in pain,28 Pligge argues that, in illness and other forms of bodily duress, the "thing body" intrudes within the experience of live bodiliness as a quasi-alien facticity--a husk, burden, or weight that no longer "belongs" to the experiencing subject. Although this emergence of a corporeality no longer felt as one's own becomes acute in path- ological situations, Pligge notes, the dispossession revealed in such situations dis- closes a more fundamental self-estrangement, the presence of something "thinglike and objectal" at the heart of subjectivity itself.29 Clearly, this insistent materiality of a body experienced as resistant and alien registers for all of Beckett's characters, from Estragon, who struggles to remove the boot from his foot, to Mouth's more profound corporeal alienation: "the machine . . . more likely the machine . . . so disconnected ... never got the message ... or powerless to respond ... like numbed" (218). Drew Leder has coined the term "dys-appearance" for this "alien presencing" of the body in pain and disease,30 though the main contribution of his own, more recent study The Absent Body is to revise Merleau-Ponty's notion of the lived body in the opposite direction. With a different Beckettian twist, Leder explores the phenomenal 26 Samuel Beckett, Not I, in Collected Shorter Plays (New York: Grove, 1984), 221. 27 Samuel Beckett, "For Avigdor Arikha," in Disjecta: Miscellaneous Writings and a Dramatic Fragment, ed.

As the impossibility of ever seeing one's internal organs and the back of one's head attests, the lived body is characterized by zones of inaccessibility or "disappearance." The eye, for instance, can never see itself seeing; as a consequence, "[p]recisely as the center point from which the perpetual field radiates, the perceptual organ remains an absence or nullity in the midst of the perceived" (13). Leder advocates a "phe- nomenological anatomy" (29), which would trace the regions of disappearance that (we might say) "ghost" the availability-to-perception of lived embodiedness: "My self-presencing in consciousness will thus be lined by a multiplicity of absences. . The phenomenologist of the body is already, and necessarily, a hermeneut" (37). To enter the experiential field of the lived body as this has been described and elaborated by contemporary phenomenology is thus to discover a landscape whose contours powerfully resemble those of Beckett's theatre. Like its philosophical an- alogues, the body in Beckett's drama constitutes a field that is simultaneously Other and troud, in which any presence-to-itself is doubly foreclosed by principles of es- trangement and absence (not I, not here) that lie at the heart of embodiment. This conception of the body represents a deepening of the ambigiiite that rules Merleau- Ponty's analysis of embodied subjectivity-a drawing out of what one might think of as the deconstructive possibilities inherent in the phenomenological stance itself. Particularly in the late plays, the Beckettian body radicalizes the phenomenological enterprise of The Phenomenology of Perception; indeed, this body is already present, in a sense, in the margins and footnotes - the liminal regions - of Merleau-Ponty's text. In their dismemberment and perceptual disfigurements, their problematic corpore- ality, Beckett's characters call attention to those figures, mostly clinical cases, whose stories of perceptual/corporeal dysfunction are heard throughout The Phenomenology: schizophrenics, neuraesthenics, aphasiacs, patients afflicted with hallucinations, drug-induced symptoms, phantom limbs, and other disturbances of body image or "bodily spatiality" ("the way the body comes into being as a body," according to Merleau-Ponty [149]). Like earlier and later phenomenologists of the body (Pligge and Leder are both medical philosophers), Merleau-Ponty is drawn to dysfunction-- particularly neurological disorder-with its various forms of perceptual aberrancy. His accounts of breakdown in the subject-body-world relationship read like a com- mentary on the Beckettian world, its peculiar perceptual topography, and its modes of disclosure and non-disclosure to the characters who inhabit it. Speaking of hal- lucination, for instance, Merleau-Ponty evokes the decentered, monologic world of the late plays: "The patient's existence is displaced from center, being no longer enacted through dealings with a harsh, resistant and intractable world which has no knowledge of us, but expending its substance in isolation creating a fictitious setting for itself" (342).31 His discussions of schizophrenia offer similar glosses on time and repetition in Beckett's plays, as in this account by a patient: 31 Merleau-Ponty's remarks on verbal hallucination (in a later lecture) offer a fascinating gloss on the depersonalized speech of Not I: "The subject no longer has the impression that he coincides with his own speech"; see Consciousness and the Acquisition of Language, trans.

Everything is always beginning all over again. (281) Finally, in Merleau-Ponty's description of the effects of mescaline (cited as epigraph to this essay), we can recognize the familiar Beckettian deformations of space and body: magnification of body parts, the simultaneous elongation and collapse of spa- tiality, the reduction of others into puppets who move in "dreamlike slow-motion."32 I do not mean to propose that Beckett's characters be reduced to clinical cases, or the contours of his dramatic worlds to neurological symptoms - though the allusions to his mother's affliction with Parkinson's disease that Hugh Culik has noted in Beckett's work reinforces the sense that clinical pathology constitutes an operative level of reference within Beckett's portraits of aberrancy.33 To whatever extent these portraits are grounded within particular forms of clinical dysfunction, the metaphoric versions of perceptual and corporeal distortion evident in Beckett's plays are clearly designed to reflect features and principles of normal corporeal subjectivity, the dis- possessions at the heart of self-possession. As such, characters like Mouth or W (in Rockaby) occupy a phenomenological territory that The Phenomenology of Perception both explores and seeks to contain. While Merleau-Ponty tends to restrict pathology to a departure from the "normal" experience of embodiment-betraying his attach- ment to what Alphonso Lingis calls "the imperative figure of an agent that holds on to things that are objectives and that maintains himself in the world"34--Beckett's theatre suggests that these perceptual conditions constitute a more fundamental potentiality and that they derive both from the structures of bodily experience and 32 Compare Billie Whitelaw's recollection of performing in Not I to the above accounts of corporeal dislocation: "[F]or the first couple of rehearsal performances, when the blindfold went on and I was stuck half-way up the stage, I think I had sensory deprivation.

This description suggests the extent to which Beckett's actors are subject to permutations of perceptual/corporeal experience similar to those undergone by Beckett's characters. W. B. Worthen discusses the corporeal subjection of Beckett's actors in "Beckett's Actor," Modern Drama 26 (1983): 415-24, and Modern Drama and the Rhetoric of Theater (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992), 131-42. 33 Hugh Culik, "Neurological Disorder and the Evolution of Beckett's Maternal Images," Mosaic 22:1 (Winter 1989): 41-53. Culik argues, for instance, that May (in Footfalls) displays the acathisia (restless pacing alternating with difficulty in initiating movement) symptomatic of Parkinson's disease (48-50). "May," of course, was also the name of Beckett's mother. 34 Alphonso Lingis, "Imperatives," in Merleau-Ponty Vivant, ed. M. C. Dillon (Albany: SUNY Press, 1991), 114. Lingis questions this privileging of grounded perception: "We want to propose that the world itself, in Merleau-Ponty's sense, is set in depths, in uncharted abysses, where there are vortices in which the body that lets loose its hold on the levels of the world, the dreaming, the visionary, the hallucinating, the lascivious body, gets drawn and drags with it not things, but those appearances without anything appearing, those phantoms, caricatures, and doubles that even in the high noon of the world float and scintillate over the contours of things and the planes of the world" (114). As I have suggested, this non-grounded world exists in what we might call the "clinical margins" of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology.</page><page sequence="13">THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL BODY / 455 from what Merleau-Ponty's own analysis, anticipating this direction, calls the "gaping wound" in subjectivity itself.35 "What remains for the eye exposed to such conditions? To such vicissitude of hardly there and wholly gone."36 No account of the phenomenological body in Beck- ett's theatre is complete without mention of the audience-the individual/collective "third body" (along with character and actor) of the stage's intercorporeal field. Full phenomenological description of Beckettian spectatorship would require a study in its own right, but certain features that would no doubt characterize such description are relevant to our discussion of the body's intricate, conflicting modes of presencing in Beckett's drama. For Beckett's spectator is staged as deliberately as his characters and actors, and with a similar phenomenological emphasis: not as the disembodied eye/I of traditional realist spectatorship but as a body situated with its own posi- tionality and material presence. In addition to direct references to the audience's presence ("I see . . . a multitude . .. in transports . .. of joy" [Endgame, 29]), this embodiedness is indirectly foregrounded, from the early plays on, by some the most familiar elements of Beckett's dramaturgy. Narrative gaps and indeterminacies resist the construction of diegetic "elsewheres"; silences effect a disclosure of the theatrical present in its physiological actuality, a disclosure heightened by the formalizing of movement and gesture; and a concern with the sound of words (Krapp's savoring of "Spooool" and "viduity," for instance) draws attention to the sensory body of dramatic speech as it is produced and perceived within the theatre. But as with the characters, merely to note the heightened thereness of Beckett's audience is to neglect the deepening ways in which this presencing becomes subject, in Beckett's career, to phenomenological complication. Just as the later plays reveal an increasing dis- possession within bodied subjectivity on the part of Beckett's characters, so these plays also involve the audience in a phenomenological displacement, disclosing the body that underlies and sustains theatrical seeing at the very moment that they subject this body to a marked perceptual decentering. Elsewhere, I have analyzed the "visual poetics" of Beckett's late plays, the specific compositional techniques by which Beckett establishes a perceptual field characterized by latency and discord: the use of half-light, failed symmetries, indeterminate spatial depth, off-centered positioning of characters and objects, deformations of color and shape, modulations of the traditional relationship between movement and stillness.37 The theatrical images of these late plays feel tense, jarring, precisely because they violate specific norms of visual perception, expectations that reflect the perceiving " Continuing his discussion of hallucination, Merleau-Ponty writes: "[T]his fiction can have the value of reality only because in the normal subject reality itself suffers through an analogous process. In so far as he too has sensory fields and a body, the normal person is equally afflicted with this gaping wound through which illusion can make its way in" (342). Despite its tendency to present dysfunction as departure and accident, in other words, The Phenomenology also conceives aberrancy as a modality of the normal. Merleau-Ponty clarifies this understanding of pathology in Consciousness and the Acquisition of Language, 63-69. 36 Samuel Beckett, Ill Seen Ill Said (New York: Grove, 1981), 37-38. 37 Stanton B.

Garner, Jr. subject's attempt to orient itself toward the perceptual object. In so doing, they engage the physiology of vision, the corporeal field within which the seeing eye is "embodied" as vision. Merleau-Ponty writes: "[T]here is an immediate equivalence between the orientation of the visual field and the awareness of one's own body as the potentiality of that field, so that any upheaval experimentally brought about can appear indifferently either as the inversion of phenomenal objects or as a redistri- bution of sensory functions in the body" (206). Perception, in other words, is ines- capably reflexive, and this is particularly evident when perceptual stimuli (an excess or deficiency of light, for instance) draw normally invisible perceptual operations to attention. The very resistance of Beckett's imagism to visual equilibrium embodies the audience within its own seeing and establishes a perceptual tension inimicable to the passive "self-forgetting" of equilibrated vision: to see with difficulty is (phe- nomenologically speaking) to become that difficulty, its intransigence internalized as physiological resistance. Reinforced by the myriad references to sight within the texts themselves-as when the Director in Catastrophe stages the mise-en-scene in terms of lighting and sight lines -the visual instabilities of Beckett's late plays engage a distinctly metaperceptual spectatorial field, one characterized by a marked refusal of self-transcending invisibility. The theatrical positioning of the audience itself also becomes a source of tension and of the peculiarly "displaced" self-experience of the spectator within Beckett's complex play of vision. Through the reflexivity discussed above, the various principles of arrangement within the late plays condition the experiential orientations of au- dience to stage. The principle of ex-centricity evident in the staging of virtually all of Beckett's late characters-the positioning of characters and objects "slightly off center" -can serve as an example. As anyone who has viewed Beckett's late plays will attest, these plays render every spectator-position, like the stage images them- selves, "slightly off." A historical analogy drawn from the visual arts may help clarify the phenomenological decentering effected by this departure from a perceptual norm. In his study of Renaissance perspective, Michael Kubovy discusses the geometric laws structuring pictorial space in relation to a viewing point outside the painting, the "center of projection" that counterpoints the vanishing point in the painting's architecture of line and convergence. As a formal construct of perspectival compo- sition, viewer position, in short, represents an ideal function of the artwork itself. "Ideal" in a strict sense: for Kubovy suggests that this virtual center can fail to correspond to the actual point of viewing, and that certain perspectival paintings manipulate this discrepancy in order to complicate the viewer's experience of bodily location. Through specific techniques of composition and mounting-the painting of Da Vinci's The Last Supper, for instance, at a height where its projective center stands over fifteen feet above the floor-painters could effect a displacement of the viewer's perceptual "egocenter," a dissonance between actual and virtual position: "these effects," Kubovy writes, "achieve the goal of divorcing the viewer's felt point of view in relation to the scene represented in the painting from the viewer's felt position in relation to the room in which he or she is standing."38 Perceptual dis- placement of this kind charges the act of seeing with a simultaneous embodiedness 38 Michael Kubovy, The Psychology of Perspective and Renaissance Art (Cambridge: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1986), 159. Kubovy discusses the concept of egocenter on pp. 150-61.</page><page sequence="15">THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL BODY / 457 and disembodiedness, as the viewer stands somewhat awkwardly in the wrong spot and imaginatively elsewhere in the correct one. The implications of this argument for theatre and its "staging" of the audience are intriguing. After perspective was abandoned as an aesthetic governing scenographic construction, the proscenium stage lost the precise "centers of projection" that it had borrowed from perspectival painting and that were intrinsic to its illusionistic ar- chitecture. But like much post-perspective painting, the proscenium stage continues to project optimal viewing positions as insistently as it establishes visual centers for its scenic arrangement: reinforced by the stage's rectangular framing, and the au- dience's perceptual disposition toward symmetrical, balanced point of view, this theatre tends to privilege viewing positions extending on an axis perpendicular to stage center. Ideal centrality in the auditorium mirrors ideal centrality on stage. To the extent that Beckett's late plays violate centrality in their scenic arrangement, even fifth-row center becomes ex-centric, visually off-balance, in relation to the per- formance image. Oriented in terms of an emptiness, facing a center point felt only in its material absence, every seat becomes subject to the angular and the unbalanced. Beckett's audience, in other words, finds itself both disembodied toward nonexistent viewing points and uncomfortably embodied within the seats they cannot escape, "clawed" by the perceptual dissonance of Beckett's stage which preclude the satis- faction of spectatorial centrality.39 Like the playwright's characters, the audience of plays like Rockaby and What Where find themselves tangentialized, situated uncom- fortably between the places they cannot occupy and those they must. Deploying other strategies of visual (dis)arrangement, individual plays compound this dissonance of placement and displacement as it afflicts spectators seeking to orient themselves toward the field of performance. By locating Mouth eight feet above stage level, and Auditor at a height of four feet, for instance, Beckett creates an upward perceptual and physiological tension, in which the action of Not I seems addressed to an audience seated several feet above itself. And by staging the Speaker in That Time with "long flaring white hair as if seen from above outspread,"40 Beckett stages his audience looking down from "above" the play's action, forcing yet another per- ceptual conflict between ideal and actual audience positions. If Beckett's late char- acters are haunted by self-division- displaced in relation to a body that nonetheless constitutes an inescapable facticity -the spectators of Beckett's late plays are haunted by a similar division and displacement, unstably re-embodied as they attempt the self-transcendence of unimpeded watching. This phenomenological play of the "here" and the "not-here" that Beckett's audience shares with his characters is only inten- sified by the dramatic speech of the late plays, which (as critics have noted)41 both does and does not allude to actual performance conditions, ambiguously doubling 39 In reference to Endgame, Beckett has spoken of "the power of the text to claw": Letter to Alan Schneider, 21 June 1956, excerpted in "Beckett's Letters on Endgame: Extracts from his Correspon- dence with Director Alan Schneider," in The Village Voice Reader, ed.

"[A]ll the time the buzzing . . . dull roar like falls . . . and the beam... flickering on and off" (Not 1, 221): these details from Mouth's monologue recall the image we see before us, but the sound of Mouth's verbal stream is not exactly a "buzz" or "dull roar," and never does the spotlight that brings this speaking orifice to view "flicker on and off." As with all aspects of Beckett's dramaturgy and stagecraft, the present moment is both actual and deferred, caught up in an oscillation between the physically here and the elsewhere, displayed for an audience that is drawn into its instabilities. Beckett, who (like Merleau-Ponty) was fascinated with the medium of painting, praised Arikha's art for pursuing "the marks of what it is to be and be in face of."42 In their increasingly pictorial use of performance space, the late plays reveal a deep- ening interest not only in the absent presence of the body as staged, but also in the dynamics of vision, an interest that recalls Merleau-Ponty's concern at the end of his career (in The Visible and the Invisible and other late writings) with the phenom- enology of visibility.43 Rather than signaling the exhaustion of phenomenology, then, these plays constitute an expansion of its field, to the point where the mise-en-scene itself becomes phenomenological and where its various elements (light, darkness, objects, sound) acquire a quality of consciousness that-even more thoroughly than the overtly phenomenological theatre of Robert Wilson -layers the technological with the perceptual contours of the subjective." For characters and audience alike, the subjectivity put into play bears little resemblance to the unitary self-presence of which phenomenology is so regularly accused: like the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Beck- ett's late plays work toward a similar expansion and contraction of subjectivity, toward a dispersal of its centers and points of reference. Whether in the spheres of "being" or "being in face of," the subjectivity set into motion within these plays is less an origin than a space, less a stabilizing orientation than "the phantom of [a] center."1145 At the same time, this subjectivity remains oriented toward that grounding from which it can never quite free itself in Beckett's work, that facticity within which it arises and from which it is ambiguously derived: what Molloy calls "that unstable 42 Beckett, "For Avigdor Arikha," 152. 43 For a recent application of Merleau-Pontean philosophy to issues of visibility and embodiment within film theory, see Vivian Sobchak, The Address of the Eye: A Phenomenology of Film Experience (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992). 44 Compare the movement toward the monochromatic in the "coloring" of Beckett's performance world with this description (an account of neurological damage) from The Phenomenology: "The destruction of sight, whatever the injuries be sustained, follows the same law: all colors are affected in the first place, and lose their saturation.

Yet together these poles represent-like the idea of ending- one of the "not quite" points of Beckett's world: that freedom from the body of which consciousness yearns but which it never attains. On the threshold of the body's disappearance into nothingness or its reversion to pure matter, there are stirrings still. Beckett's drama (and his prose, for that matter) maintain their inherence in the problematics of Leiblichkeit, an inherence that only intensifies with each representation of embodiment: as Beckett's middle and late works gradually abandon the naturalistic body, with its physiological integrity and recognizably anthropomorphic environ- ment, they more directly confront the phenomenological body, with its decentered field of subjectivity and its ambiguous modes of absence and presence. This reading of Beckett's drama of embodiment returns us to poststructuralism and its traditional argument with phenomenology. Though such concepts as "de- centering" and "absence" have been appropriated within the poststructuralist critique of language, these concepts (as I have suggested) have equally powerful roots in the phenomenological tradition, especially as this tradition has sought to move beyond the originary, transcendental ego and the notion of presence as pure self-givenness. As Madison suggests, "The history of the phenomenological movement is the history of the progressive attempt to eradicate the traces still present within it of the very resilient metaphysics of presence, to exorcise the metaphysical ghosts that continue to haunt our discourse."47 A reading of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of the body makes it clear that the problematic subjectivity that Trezise correctly finds in Beckett's work--the "breach" or fflure at the heart of self-presence--was the province of the post-Husserlian phenomenology articulated by Beckett's contemporaries as it would be for the poststructuralist analysis that followed. I do not mean to cast Merleau- Ponty as a proto-Derridean, or to suggest that phenomenology and deconstruction are destined to merge at the same point from different directions.48 If phenomenology and poststructuralism arrive at similar principles in their models of subjectivity, they do so along parallel, not converging, lines of inquiry. While Derridean analysis allows us to approach this breach in self-presence through the play of differance (or deferral) intrinsic to signification and textuality, the tradition within post-Husserlian phenom- enology inaugurated by Merleau-Ponty (like that of Heidegger and Sartre) approaches 46 Samuel Beckett, Molloy, in Three Novels: Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnamable, trans. Patrick Bowles (New York: Grove, 1955), 11. 47 Gary Brent Madison, The Hermeneutics of Postmodernity (Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1988), xiii. Madison calls for a "poststructuralist phenomenology," "a phenome- nology which will have made profitable use of the many pertinent criticisms that poststructuralism has addressed not only to the Tradition but also to phenomenology itself" (xiii-xiv). 48 The parallels and divergences between Merleau-Ponty's philosophy and poststructuralism are the subject of several recent essays: Gary Brent Madison, "Merleau-Ponty and Postmodernity," in The Hermeneutics of Postmodernity, 57-81, and "Merleau-Ponty's Deconstruction of Logocentrism," in Merleau-Ponty Vivant, 117-52; M.

These blind spots are, of course, usefully symmetrical, and the two approaches balance each other in their separate pursuits. The dialectic of overlap and divergence that characterizes poststructuralist and phenomenological modes of analysis presents an opportunity for drama and performance theory: the opportunity to cultivate a "binocular" approach to performance that would pursue both the signs in phenomena and the phenomena in signs.49 From such a perspective, phenomenology ceases to play its now-cliched role within a ritual of repudiation; rather, it claims its place as the necessary other term of a fundamental complementarity. Offering an emphasis with particular relevance to theatre--that most bodied of all mediums--phenome- nology complements the "always already" of signification with the "always also" of the subject's corporeal fields. 49 States speaks of phenomenology and semiotics as constituting "a kind of binocular vision" (Great Reckonings, 8).</page></plain_text>
