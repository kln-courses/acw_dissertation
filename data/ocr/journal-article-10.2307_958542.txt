<plain_text><page sequence="1">so long as Mahler's characteristic widely-spaced texture is faithfully preserved. After all, the thematic line throughout and something like 90% of the counterpoint and harmony are pure Mahler, and vintage Mahler at that. In the original piecemeal presentation of the work in 1960-intended more as a musicological experi- ment than as a real performance-there was only a modicum of pastiche; but after listening many times to a recording of that version 1 grew a little bolder. I had always been struggling with my inherent purism, but came to realize that here a total purism could result only in a pedantic distortion of Mahler's intentions, by leaving passages of the work unrealistically and ineffectively empty. In consequence, the score used for the first full- length performance of 1964, and for those that followed it (including the CBS recording), contained rather more pastiche. After a number of hearings 1 felt that this version, too, could be considerably improved, and from 1966 onwards 1 undertook a thorough-going revision. 1 was helped this time by the expert criticism and active imaginative assistance of two young Mahler scholars, Colin and David Matthews, who were as eager that the performing version of Mahler's draft should be the best possible one as I and Berthold Goldschmidt were. In the final version, Mahler's thematic, contra- puntal and harmonic substance, his orchestration, and his bar-by-bar structure (except for the deletion of a single bar in the fourth movement) have still not been altered in any way-as they could hardly be, since he laid them down so firmly in his draft; the one or two changed notes represent corrections of misreadings. But I have removed some of my additions to the texture and added new ones; also, the additional instrumentation in the second move- ment has been thoroughly revised, and so has the orchestration of the fourth and fifth. In particular, the triple woodwind of the previous score (taken over too unthinkingly from the Krenek-Schalk- Zemlinsky edition of the Adagio and Purgatorio, published in 1951 by Associated Music Publishers, New York) has been expanded to a full Mahlerian woodwind section, which allows for far greater separation of the woodwind and string lines. The result, it is hoped, will present Mahler's draft as clearly and powerfully as possible, while still not interfering with its substance (rather less than before, in fact). The score is dedicated to the memory of Mrs Mahler, for three reasons. First, because Mahler wrote his Tenth Symphony for her, and would undoubtedly have dedicated it to her himself. Second, because she did so much to try to have the work brought to life. And third, because in the end she withdrew her ban on the present performing version and gave it her blessing. David Blake's Violin Concerto Gerald Larner The work, a BBC commission, will be performed during the Albert Hall Prom on August 19. Reading through David Blake's new Violin Concerto was an unexpectedly exciting experience. It was unexpected for two reasons: one, frankly, is that I do not claim to be able to see half as much in a faint photocopy of a manuscript score as I can hear in a tolerably clear performance; the other is that not one of Blake's other instrumental works is nearly so sensual. It is true that his In Praise of Krishna is a voluptuous score. It is probably also true that working for the past two years on his Caribbean opera, Toussaint l'Ouverture (which is due for first performance at the Coliseum in 1978) has helped to liberate his imagination. Those are, on the other hand, vocal works, each with a text to inspire a physical reaction. There is a sort of programme behind the Violin Concerto but, unforewarned, one need not become aware of this until after the beginning of the second of the two movements, by which time it is too late to resist. A nocturnal beginning is not without precedent in the modern violin concerto, and there is no programme, as far as we know, behind Shostakovich's First. Like Shostakovich's nocturne, Blake's is serially organized without the formal introduction of a series. The difference is that, whereas Shostakovich's is of a fairly obvious tonality, Blake's is not. The 7ths, 9ths, and tritones in the expressive melodic line, passing from bass clarinet to clarinet to horn, and in the dark har- monies in the lower strings, ensure that there are no tonal associations, just as the rhythms obscure the underlying metre. The main theme of the nocturne is a composite of a legato melody on second violins and violas with a cantabile counter- point high on first violins against a murmuring background on flute and clarinet. The solo violin, which has entered imperceptibly on a top E in unison with the first violins, suddenly disturbs the atmosphere with a passionate and capricious cadenza. But it does this in its own time, independently of the orchestra, which calmly continues as before and which eventually draws the soloist into its lyrical embrace. Peace is definitively breached, however, by a staccato chattering of woodwind and, after a short but thematically important solo cadenza, the tempo changes to allegro deciso. This is the beginning of the equivalent of a concerto first movement, with the first subject another composite, a 12-note theme in the horns and an energetic variant in smaller note values on the solo violin. There are several other prominent ideas, including a rhythmically complex, contrapuntal fanfare for brass. But the second subject must be the episode marked calmo, with a tinkling celesta ostinato, glissando chord clusters on violins, and a lyrical hint on the oboe 649</page><page sequence="2">taken up by the soloist. Of the two contrasting types of material, it is the allegro deciso element which is favoured in the development, particularly in a shattering climax just before a largamente restatement of the 12-note theme. The calmo material is also recalled, after a thoughtful cadenza, and the movement ends on a chromatic run upwards in a written-out acceleration for the whole orchestra. The second of the two movements is basically a presto scherzo with two trios and an epilogue. The soloist takes no part in the first section of the scherzo and is induced to make an entry, in an apparently protesting recitative, only after a loud allusion to the chattering woodwind music from the first movement. Since the recitative also echoes first-movement material, there need be no surprise at the anthropomorphic gestures at this point. But when, in this atonal and still not clearly metrical context, the strings offer a simple rhythmic accom- paniment figure in plain A minor and the soloist obliges with a cabaletta, the listener is bound to wonder why. Similarly, the second trio (again introduced by a solo recitative) is an andante aria in Db major. Such tonal features may be related to the fact that the Violin Concerto was written shortly after the composer's first visit to Italy. As a pupil of Eisler, Blake was firmly brought up in the post- Schoenberg Teutonic tradition. So the Italian experience-particularly the sculpture of Michel- angelo, but also the atmosphere of the campagna and the melos of bel canto-affected him all the more deeply. This explains the presence of the A minor and Db major trios. It was a night-time scene at Barga which inspired the opening nocturne, the Michelangelo David in the Florence Academy which inspired the powerful orchestral writing in the allegro deciso, and the Madonna in St Peter's which inspired the ethereal calmo second subject. It is the Italian experience, too, which explains the unexpected acceleration in the softening of the intellectual rigour associated with Blake's earlier music. This is not intended to suggest, however, that Blake has lost his structural virtue. Although he is certainly taking more risks, on behalf of the senses, the Violin Concerto is no less well integrated for that. By the time the second trio of the second move- ment appears, there have already been several allusions back to the first movement, not to mention all the more or less distant serial relationships be- tween the various themes. Now the andante is merged with the presto material, as the soloist continues his Db aria and the orchestra simul- taneously resumes the scherzo. A massive orchestral climax brings the proportions of the presto into symmetrical balance with those of the allegro deciso, and a chromatic run downwards in a written-out deceleration neatly reflects the end of the first movement. Not surprisingly, the slow epilogue (my termin- ology) is a lingering recall of the opening nocturne, mingled with memories of the Madonna. Over these lyrical echoes the solo violin sings a melody shaped by the words of a Michelangelo sonnet, lines from which stand on the title page of the score. The witty last few bars allude discreetly to the rhythm of the cabaletta and end quietly on a chord not unrelated to D[. Bernard Benoliel Calum MacDonald Benoliel's 'With St Paul in Albion' will be performed in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh, by Alasdair Mitchell and Michael Lester-Cribb, on August 29. Bernard Benoliel is a 32-year-old American com- poser who has been living in this country for the past five years. Not a note of his music is yet published, and until recently he experienced great difficulty in obtaining performances of his works, even though the scores tended to arouse strong reactions for or against. It is as hard as ever to break the vicious circle whereby unwillingness to take pains over music that requires much time and effort, if its composer has no established reputation, ensures that the composer remains without repu- tation through lack of performances. Happily, after four performanceless years Benoliel's situation began to change. It is to be hoped that the coming performance during the Edinburgh Festival of his With St Paul in Albion, for amplified cello and organ, will focus some belated attention on a composer whom I believe to be one of the most significant of his generation. 650 Benoliel was born in Detroit, where he played piano and trumpet and studied composition with Ross Lee Finney at the University of Michigan. The first works he now acknowledges date from 1968; and in that year he became a private pupil of the late Stefan Wolpe, with whom he studied in New York until 1970. Wolpe (who regarded Benoliel as one of the most gifted pupils of his last years) gave him his most valuable insights into the re- sources of pitch serialism. But Wolpe had also been a proteg6 of Busoni: David Drew once wrote that Wolpe was the chief heir to 'the tradition of Busoni's radicalism, rather than of his classicism'. It may be that this part of Busoni's divided mantle now rests on Benoliel's shoulders. Certainly his music, like Busoni's, stubbornly resists easy classification. His works are few, but painstakingly and meticulously crafted. Their outlook is intensely traditional, but that should give no comfort to mere conservatives, for they celebrate a still-advancing tradition in the pride of its full complexity.
