<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews New Perspectives on the Seventeenth-Century English Religious Lyric edited by John R. Roberts Columbia and London: University of Missouri Press, 1994. 335 pages. REVIEWED BY JEFFREY POWERS-BECK rT-. nhis collection of twelve essays is more cohesive than its grab-bag title might suggest. In his introduction to the collection, John R. Roberts proposes that the book is structured around three basic questions: First of all, is the religious lyric truly a distinct genre or is it simply a lyric poem on a religious subject or theme? Secondly, what do we mean by "religious" in this context? Is our understanding of "religious" too narrow and restricted? And thirdly, to what extent did the religious lyric participate in, and how was it shaped by, the political, social, theologi- cal, and cultural contexts in which it was written? The order and emphasis of the questions imply that an aesthetic concern with poetic forms and traditions overrides the discussion of some social and historical issues; and indeed, the more radical "new perspectives"-those of cultural studies and feminist and gay studies-are largely absent from the volume. The historical analysis of literary and devotional forms, however, is incisive. Taken together, the essays seek to unify newer historicist approaches with older formalist ones, to appreciate the poems as "well-wrought urns"-the vessels (as Louis L. Martz says) of both art and history. The contributors, including Martz, Claude J. Summers, P. G. Stanwood, and Stella P. Revard, employ both historicist and formalist approaches to locate seventeenth-century religious lyrics amid sites of political controversy and to expand reductive notions of the religious lyric. Broadly conceived essays by Martz, Helen Wilcox, and Michael C. Schoen- feldt demonstrate both the social and the aesthetic power of devotional lyrics as literary forms. In "'Curious Frame': The Seventeenth-Century Religious Lyric as Genre," Wilcox details features that distinguish this body of poetry as a devotional genre, in her view: the poets' "distinctive attitudes to words and the Word, poetic structures, emblematic modes, transcendence, and the baptismal humility of their own calling"-all resulting in a curious sense of imperfection and transience, HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY - 58:2  - 269</page><page sequence="2">270 B despite the poems' highly wrought forms. Although Wilcox's conclusion that the religious lyric of this period is a discrete genre is by no means surprising, her grace- ful and unfamiliar illustrations of its defining traits (citing poets such as Elisabeth Major and Patrick Cary) are a delight, and a surprise in themselves. Providing a more theoretical justification for this kind of study is Martz's contribution, "The Poetry of Meditation: Searching the Memory." In a thorough-going defense of the historical interests of the New Criticism, Martz points out that it was a formal analysis of Donne's Anniversaries, undertaken in the classroom, that led to his research on Counter-Reformation spiritual exercises and to The Poetry of Meditation. Martz proposes a broad definition of a "New Critical Historicism" that embraces C. L. Barber's Shakespeare's Festive Comedy, Joseph Summers's George Herbert, and M. H. Abrams's writings on the Romantics. All of the essays in this collection, in their attempts to join history and form, seem to address Martz's definition, even the most distinctively New Historicist piece, Schoenfeldt's provocative "The Poetry of Supplication: Toward a Cultural Poetics of the Religious Lyric." Schoenfeldt argues convincingly that it is an anthropomorphic impulse in the lyrics of Donne and Herbert-a tendency to represent the supplication of God in terms of social entreaties-that makes poems like "As Due by Many Titles" and "Love (III)" so humanly compelling. As this tendency became attenuated in Vaughan's poetry, and as the poet's relation- ship with God became almost purely private in Traherne's meditations, says Schoenfeldt, the religious lyric began to lose its cultural power. While he ventures far beyond formal analysis of the lyrics in his cultural poetics, with characteristic generosity he acknowledges his roots in Eliot's notion of "the dissociation of sen- sibility" and in Martzs study on meditation as an art form. Two other essays in the collection also clearly bear the influence of Martz's historical study of devotional forms-Stanwood's "Liturgy, Worship, and the Sons of Light" and Revard's "Christ and Apollo in the Seventeenth-Century Religious Lyric." Stanwood contends that the religious lyrics of the period are "always .. . liturgical" by definition, whether explicitly or implicitly. Stanwood finds a remarkable implicit example of a liturgical poem in Eve's morning hymn in book 5 of Paradise Lost, comparing it to the Benedicite, Omnia Opera, a morn- ing canticle in the Book of Common Prayer. In a slightly different vein, involving the Counter-Reformation use of classical icons, Revard argues persuasively that the Apollo Belvedere-a syncretic symbol of classical inspiration and resurgent Catholicism under Urban VIII-appears prominently not only in Crashaw's poetry, where it is adored, but also in Milton's poetry, where the Apollo is repu- diated as a false deity.

Summers demonstrates how Herrick and Vaughan developed "a hermeneutics of suffering and an eschatological perspective" in their sacred poetry as a response to the defeat of the royalist cause. Summers's reading of Herrick's sacred poems is especially acute-revealing the political connotations behind many of the admonitory lyrics, disclosing the ecclesiastical allegory of plundered churches in "The Widdowes tears," and remarking the conflation of Christ and the soon-to- be martyred King Charles in the final passion sequence of Noble Numbers. Guibbory provides new insight into the religious dimensions of Herrick's Hesperides. Noting that poem 666 in the sequence was an obvious jibe at William Prynne (the infamous Puritan opponent of the theater), Guibbory shows that many of the lyrics in fact posed a challenge to Puritan sensibilities. Indeed, since Herricks eclectic mixture of pagan and traditional Christian rites was precisely what many Puritans wished to purge from the Church of England, the religious dimensions of these poems would have appeared keenly political. Five other essays-two primarily on Herbert (by Christopher Hodgkins and Judith Dundas), two on Donne (by Anthony Low and R. V. Young Jr.), and one on Crashaw (by Eugene R. Cunnar)-make up the balance of the collection, fol- lowed by Roberts's own selective bibliography of secondary work on this poetry, spanning 1952 to 1990. All of these pieces have merit, but Hodgkins's spirited defense of Herbert's country parson in "'Showing Holy': Herbert and the Rhetoric of Sanctity" and Cunnar's deft probing of Crashaw's ritualized wounds in "Opening the Religious Lyric" seem to me to provide the most provocative new perspectives. Roberts has published the leading annotated bibliographies of Donne, Herbert, and Crashaw, and the selective bibliography that concludes the volume might serve as a fine seminar aid or introduction to this field-albeit one with a marked preference for Roman-Catholic poetry (featuring many articles on Crashaw, Robert Southwell, Henry Constable, William Alabaster, and Gertrude More). Although a survey of past criticism might at first seem out of place in a collection promising "new perspectives," it suits the apologetic burden of the vol- ume. Because the selective bibliography begins with criticism published just before Martz's Poetry of Meditation appeared in 1954, Roberts offers abundant testimony to the legacy of New Critical Historicism that is the overarching argu- ment of New Perspectives on the Seventeenth-Century English Religious Lyric.
