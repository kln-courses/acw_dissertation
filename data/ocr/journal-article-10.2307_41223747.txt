In recognition of this the MBI Foundation logo has been placed on the cover of this volume. We would also like to express our gratitude to the Seven Pillars of Wisdom Trust, which has assisted the Seminar on a previous occasion, for making a second grant. These two awards have put the Seminar and the Proceedings onto a sound financial footing this year. The Editor would also like to thank Dr Paul Bibire for creating the Times Semitic font in which this volume of the Proceedings has been printed and which will be employed in all future volumes. It is an embedded Unicode font based on Times New Roman, and the drawing of the 150 extra letters, finding and assigning key-strokes for them and the creation of macros for automatic conversion from the ASCII-based transliteration in which texts are submitted, required a considerable amount of time, thought, patience and meticulous work. The Committee is extremely grateful to Dr Bibire for this.</page><page sequence="9">Transliteration Quotations, single words and phrases from Arabic or other languages written in non-Roman alphabets, are reproduced in "strict" transliteration according to the systems set out below. However, unless an author insists on a particular transliteration in all circumstances, place-names and words from languages written in non-Roman alphabets, which have entered English or French in a particular form (e.g. Mecca, Mocha, Dhofar, qadi, imam/iman), are reproduced in that form when they are part of an English or French sentence, rather than part of a quotation in the original language or of a correctly transliterated name or phrase. For example • "the settlement was built in the wadi bed" BUT "the settlement in Wadï Mayfacah"; • "the mosque in Medina" BUT "the mosque in al-Madïnat al-Munawwarah"; • "the imam went to the mosque" BUT "Imam cAlï went to the mosque"; • "he travelled in Dhofar" BUT "he visited the Himyarite capital Zafar". Place-names and personal names which do not have a generally accepted conventional spelling in English/French, but which occur within an English/French context, are given in "strict" transliteration but using th (&lt;^), kh (¿), dh (b), sh (cč), gh (£), rather than t9 Л, rf, s, g, respectively, so that they are consistent with names with established spellings (e.g. Dhamär, Ibn Khaldün) and are more easily recognizable to non-linguists. Note that Ä is used for ¿ and that h is used only in transliterations from Akkadian. Such a policy inevitably involves a degree of subjectivity and inconsistency, but it seeks to avoid pedantry and to leave these words, personal names and toponyms in forms which are recognizable by linguists and non-linguists alike. The ff strict" transliteration systems used in PSAS are as follows: (a) Arabic * ° £ j * d &lt;jS £ -k ? á q on y 4 Z h j r 0a ? t c ^ к * h ^ t t b J z o^ d tg J / j w ^ t ¿ d o» s Ja t ^ f ? m с? у Vowels: a, i, u, a, l п. Diphthongs aw, ay. TãD marbutah (S) is rendered by -Ä, except in construct (e.g. birkah, zakãh, and birkat al-sibãhah, zakãt al-fifr). (b) Ancient North and South Arabian as for Arabic, except that g is used instead of y, and the non-emphatic unvoiced sibilants are rendered by s2, s2 and s3. (c) Other Semitic languages appear in the transliteration systems outlined in the Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 226 (1986), p. 3. (d) Persian, Urdu and Ottoman Turkish as for Arabic with the additional letters transliterated according to the system in the Encyclopaedia of Islam (New Edition) except that z is used instead of zh.</page></plain_text>
