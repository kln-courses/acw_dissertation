<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 'apostasy and corruption"' (pp. 206-7; cf. p. 32). In fact, Toland's 1698 three-volume edition of Milton's prose with its prefixed "Life ofJohn Milton" (also published separately in 1698) and his Amyntor, Or a Defence of Milton's Life (1699) were works of anti-Williamite Whig propaganda that threatened the stability of the Revolutionary government by suggesting that William III had become a tyrannic usurper whose ouster was recommended by the pro-regicide sentiments of the great author of Paradise Lost. Hollis, on the other hand, published works of Sidney and Locke that idealized King William and criticized George III for possessing Tory sympathies which threatened remaining remnants of William's Revolutionary Whig golden era. And both party publicists produced substandard scholarly editions of these authors. Patterson follows these propagandists in subsuming her canonical figures into political icons without distinguishing the degree to which their various writings resist later partisan political reading. Nor does she distinguish these party publicists' aims from her own goal of ethico-political recanonization. Indeed, she so identifies their canonizing efforts with her own that she projects onto them her mission of introducing her post-classical protoliberals into college curricula in order to have their principles of good government appreciated anew, at a time when "in the academy ... it is customary to build new reputations by sneering at earlier idealisms and accomplishments as philosophically blinkered or politically oversimplified" (p. 3). Patterson is indulging a nostalgically conservative vision of the shaping of future American leaders through undergraduate citizen training courses given at old Harvard and Yale (and satellite liberal arts colleges). She shows a lack of respect for the academic order that emerged with the ascendancy of the research university, when many scholars found cause enough for undertaking specialist work in textual criticism and the old historicism. Johns Hopkins University D. N. DELUNA Barbara Cohen, J. Hillis Miller, Andrzej Warminski, and Tom Cohen, eds., Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory. University of Minnesota Press, 2000. 408 pages. "Why de Man today?" begins the introduction to a collection of essays that looks at the late work of Paul de Man, Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory. The volume, edited by Barbara Cohen, J. Hillis Miller, Andrzej Warminski, and Tom Cohen, contains work by many of those associated with de Man during his lifetime and after, as well as some surprises. In addition to the editors, Michael Sprinker, Arkady Plotnitsky, T. J. Clark, Laurence A. Rickels, Barbara Johnson, Ernesto Laclau, Judith Butler, and Jacques Derrida have contributed essays on the question of materiality and 1158</page><page sequence="2">M L N the aesthetic, its relation to the "historial" and inscription. The question that initiates the anthology serves, in part, to mark the historiality of de Man's corpus, the hostility and hospitality that continue to nurture its afterlife. The temporicities of today wander throughout this volume in the materialities of a time and history that no longer facilitate the incontrovertibility of the present. De Man is today, and perhaps always was, the authors suggest, profoundly untimely, requiring, as it were, a thinking of the materiality of time and its untimely nature. Taking as their point of departure de Man's posthumous collection of essays Aesthetic Ideology (1997), the authors of Material Events extend de Man's conception of materiality, ideology, and the aesthetic into the registers of political thought, sexual difference, painting and film, and technology. The editors respond to their own challenge with this provisional claim: "What remains unengaged in de Man's text addresses the possibility of intervention in the mnemonic, the programming of the 'historial,' and a treatment of 'materiality' that compels a rethinking of technicity and the 'sensorium' on the basis of inscription." At stake is a rethinking of materiality and aesthetics, but also the politics of time, memory, and the human. They note in their preface the shift in de Man's late writing from "tropological systems" to the "materiality of inscription," a move, they claim, which makes possible new considerations of aesthetics and politics and the logic that connects them. This collection of post-de Manian inscriptions serves as an untimely rejoinder to the critique of theory and the dismissal of de Man and deconstruction, on the basis of a "mimetic politics." Can Aesthetic Ideology be read in the current intellectual climate? Can it contribute to a new line of inquiry that moves beyond the impasses of this historical moment in a manner that also understands the historiality of this historical moment, its momentary materi- ality as history? "At a time when the untimely might feel at home, when the aporias not of theory but of mimetic historicist and cultural criticism are becoming transparent in all issues pertaining to institutional politics and agency, Material Events would pose this question too." The conception of this volume began, the editors explain, with a 1998 conference at UC Davis that sought to situate the "afterlife" of theory and "de Man's recent abjection in critical studies." From this premise, a propos of de Man after his death, the authors have initiated a reevaluation of de Man's conception of materiality "without any agenda." The very materiality of evaluation and reevaluation, the materiality of the value of theory-and its costs-leads to the question of legacy and the material economies that are opened by its historicities, temporalities, and debts. Material Events seeks to take account of the legacy of de Man, in part, its debts, paid and unpaid, but also to understand the possibility of a de Manian materiality yet to come, yet to fulfill as legacy, the materiality of the future. Says Derrida, "this thinking could only belong to the future," it even "makes the future possible." A future that speaks to the demands of poetry and literature, art and science, philosophy and psychoanalysis, law and politics, and ultimately the technics 1159</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS and technology of the archive-de Man's own archive (proper and im- proper), but also the archive as such. The density of this volume makes any attempt to summarize the essays virtually impossible. The book arrives like a body in parts, to paraphrase Judith Butler. A machinic and posthumous body that sustains its signs of vitality without ever assuming the flow of an organic system. Even a selective, superficial account, however, reveals the complexity of the collection, the multiple reflections and trajectories that de Man's material aesthetic launches. Andrzej Warminski's "'As the poets do it': On the Material Sublime" and "Postscriptum: On the Super-performative" opens the collection. Moving from poetry across the mathematical and dynamic sublime, Warminski arrives at a "material sublime," a term he insists remains inadequate. Positing the "break" and "discontinuity" in de Man's work from tropology to material- ity, a set of irreversible gestures that traverses de Man's thought from poetry to discourses of the sublime, Warminski argues for the production of an excess in de Man's reading of the sublime that reconfigures the tropology as a form of materiality. "In its purely positional transposition of a number into extension, of inscribed markers into phenomenal tropes, of catachreses into impossible metaphors, the tropological system of the mathematical sublime introduces an excess or a lack that cannot be mastered or controlled or accounted for by the resources-by the principles of substitution and combination-of that system and therefore prevents itself from ever being able to close itself off as system." The lacking excess, or excessive lack that Warminski locates in de Man's work leads to a materiality of the sublime that is no longer linguistic in any proper sense, no longer strung along the lines of a postponed tropology. Michael Sprinker's "Art and Ideology: Althusser and de Man" pursues an aesthetic ideology, an aesthetics of ideology, and an ideology of the aesthetic from Althusser's and de Man's thought. Following a trajectory from Althusser and de Man, Sprinker concludes: "The presentation of ideology in art, as it were, estranges ideology from itself, creating the possibility for, not only identification with or interpellation by the ideology presented, but a knowl- edge of it." Arkady Plotnitsky's "Algebra and Allegory: Nonclassical Episte- mology, Quantum Theory, and the Work of Paul de Man" extends de Man's nonclassical criticism into the general realm of nonclassical epistemologies such as quantum mechanics. The basis of nonclassical thought, for Plotnitsky, is the irreducible role of technology, tekhne, in them. "The technology of measurement in quantum physics, or of tekhne of 'writing' in Derrida's sense, and the tekhne of 'linguistic materiality' in de Man's sense . . . make the situations in question nonclassical." Plotnitsky traces the "ideas of Bohr and other key figures in the history of quantum physics ... to nonclassical aspects of the nineteenth-century philosophy, literature and arts, and then to modernism." He continues by reading the influence of nonclassical thought in general, "quantum-mechanical" ideas in particular on de Man's work. From the opening of nonclassical thought in de Man's writing, Plotnitsky 1160</page><page sequence="4">M L N traverses the mathematical sublime, algebra, the law, and ultimately lawless- ness, suggesting throughout de Man's oeuvre the presence of an allegory of nonclassical knowledge. T.J. Clark's "Phenomenality and Materiality in Cezanne" and Tom Cohen's "Political Thrillers: Hitchcock, de Man, and Secret Agency in the 'Aesthetic State"' bring de Man's aesthetic to bear on painting and film. Clark's essay reads the problematic of materiality, phenomenality, and the aesthetic in Cezanne against the corpus of de Man. The juxtaposition produces in Clark's text a series of intriguing assertions, including the possibility of "non-human textures," an inhuman materiality, and the recession of the sublime. Of the phenomenality that traverses Cezanne and de Man, Clark writes: "The moment at which a text or depiction reaches out most irresistibly to a thing seen or experienced is also the moment at which it mobilizes the accidents and duplicities of the markmaking most flagrantly, most outlandishly-all in the service of pointing through them, and somehow with them, to another body." Such moments produce, for Clark, an "adequacy of form to content," "mind to world" that is nonetheless part of the "aesthetic illusion." Cohen's reading of Alfred Hitchcock's "secret agency" through de Man's notions of materiality and inscription diverts the reception of the auteur from the "consumerist logic of mimesis" toward a "mnemonics of inscription." Circumventing the Benjaminian topology of cinema, Cohen moves vis-a-vis de Man and Hitchcock toward a cinemallographics: "the ability to alter perception, reading, time, the 'human."' Cohen's writing itself achieves a velocity that appears to enter into the frenzy of Hitchcock's world, function- ing as an element in the secret agencies that permeate and drive the films. "A kind of mnemonic trace, neither living nor dead, void of semantic content yet that upon which all switchboard relays or translation or even visibility (reading) seems to rest." Perhaps the most provocative essay in the volume, Laurence A. Rickels's "Resistance in Theory," takes de Man's "legendary" resistance to psychoanaly- sis, what Rickels characterizes as a hostility to "therapeutic correctness," to task. Rickels sees in de Man's resistance to psychoanalysis a symptom that permeates the erasure of "Freud's formative influence" on both Benjamin and Adorno, for example, in the United States. What follows in Rickels's essay is a rigorous reading of de Man-at once against and through de Man-in the prism of techno-tropic transference, a function that charges and suc- cumbs to repression in de Man. From an initial contact with de Manian resistance, Rickels launches into a discussion of Nazi rocket projects and haunted voice recording, a reading that effects, as it were, an acoustics of transference embedded in the economies of resistance. The sonic and supersonic interactions of transference follow, in Rickels's reading, from a kind of de Mania that makes possible a resistance that gives. J. Hillis Miller's "Paul de Man as Allergen" offers a reading of de Man as an irritant, but also an infection. Of de Man's effect on the respiratory systems of his audience, Miller writes: "De Man's work is a violent allergen that provokes 1161</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS fits of coughing, sneezing, and burning eyes, perhaps even worse symptoms, unless it can be neutralized or expelled." Miller posits de Man as an infection whose materiality-the allergic symptom-cannot be ignored. "The best antihistamine," says Miller, "might be to forget his essays altogether and get on with the reproduction of some form or other of aesthetic ideology." The problem of memory and allergen, raised by Miller, perhaps best describes the persistence of de Man's work, its continued ability to irritate from someplace else, to infect the reader with an irreducible otherness. "At the limit, and indeed all along the way, de Man's writings are allergenic because they pass on to the reader an allergen, an otherness, with which they have been infected and that is quite other to the calm, implacable, rational, madden- ingly difficult to refute, rigor of de Man's argumentation." Reading the text of a 1993 Supreme Court opinion ("Rowland v. California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council") together with de Man's essay "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," BarbaraJohnson's "Anthropo- morphism in Lyric and Law" asks, "What is a person?" Johnson characterizes de Man's text as "one of his most difficult, even outrageous . . . both hyperbolic and elliptical." Between de Man's reading of Baudelaire and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's opinion of what constitutes a person-natural or aggregate, artificial-Johnson asks whether in law or lyric the question of the human has ever been resolved. With two examples taken from lyric and law, Johnson reads the cuts that sever personification from anthropomorphism, exposing the profound stakes that underlie a presuppo- sition of what it means to be a person. She concludes, "Lyric and law are two of the most powerful discourses that exist along the fault line of this question." In "The Politics of Rhetoric," Ernesto Laclau poses the question of politics and de Man, asking, "Why would a political theorist like me, working mainly on the role of hegemonic logics in the structuration of political spaces, be interested in the work of a prominent literary critic such as Paul de Man?" Laclau responds by noting de Man's legacy of subverting "the frontiers separating theoretical from literary disciplines," but also the "tropological" nature of "all political difference and identity" toward which de Man's intellectual project moves. Laclau's critique of hegemony travels across several political dilemmas, including Russian social-democracy at the turn of the twentieth century and South African apartheid. In each instance, Laclau credits the force of de Manian rhetoricity, extended "to the ensemble of language" and made into a "constitutive dimension of language as such." He also recognizes de Man's deconstruction of symbol and metaphor, "showing the contingent infrastructure of more humble tropoi on which any totalizing effect is grounded." For Laclau, the afterlife of de Man's work makes possible an "elaboration of a theory of hegemony." Judith Butler's vigilant return to Descartes, "How Can I Deny These Hands and This Body are Mine," emerges from the materiality, as she notes, of a sleepless body that is discursive in its very materiality. Butler weaves through- 1162</page><page sequence="6">M L N out her text a chain of significations that moves from Descartes's project of radical doubt, across the topologies of paranoia and hallucination, toward the linguistic-materialities of the body named and then erased in Descartes's meditation. The passage through this sequence is made possible by de Man's notion of materiality, which, Butler claims, "marks the conditions and limits of figuration itself." Butler continues: "Materiality will be precisely that which is convertible into neither figuration nor cognition. This materiality charac- terizes an aesthetic vision in its irreducibility." In Butler's reading of the body, the materialities of language and body, while not interchangeable, are nonetheless linked by a tropology. "Language itself cannot proceed without positing the body, and when it tries to proceed as if the body were not essential to its own operation, figures of the body reappear in spectral and partial form within the very language that seeks to perform their denial." Butler navigates Descartes's skeptical impasse, the philosopher's attempts to destroy the body in thought, thought in corporeal- ity, by inscribing a material economy onto thought and the body that makes a thinking of the body and a body of thought possible. "If there is a materiality of the body that escapes from the figures it conditions and by which it is corroded and haunted, then this body is neither a surface nor a substance, but the linguistic occasion of the body's separation from itself, one that eludes its capture by the figure it compels." The volume concludes withJacques Derrida's "Typewriter Ribbon: Limited Ink (2) ('within such limits')." To a series of interventions he has made in the afterlife of Paul de Man, Derrida adds perhaps his most far-reaching assessment of the machines, organic and inorganic, which dictate the de Manian event. An event that is machinic in nature, which is to say, profoundly unnatural, organized against every distinction between organic and inor- ganic matter. "I will wonder," says Derrida, "a propos of de Man, what might be a thinking of machinistic materiality without materialism and even perhaps without matter." The event is, for Derrida, a machine in every sense that he has always given to this term. "Will we one day be able, and in a single gesture, to join the thinking of the event to the thinking of the machine?" Derrida returns, as he has before when addressing de Man, to the machinery of confession and apology. Following Augustine's and Rousseau's confessions and de Man's reading of Rousseau, Derrida traces the lines that separate excuse and guilt in de Man's analysis. A propos of de Man, he writes: "The more one excuses oneself, the more one admits that one is guilty and the more one feels guilt. Guilty of excusing oneself. By excusing oneself. The more one excuses oneself, the less one clears oneself. Guilt is thus an ineffaceable inscription, inexorable because inexonerable." One feels guilt. Derrida's recourse to the affect of guilt is important because it forms an infrastructure that fuels the machinery of Derrida's essay, the machinic materiality and affect that drive it. Apparent throughout Derrida's contribution to this volume is a deep current of emotion: at times exhausted, despondent, at others still angry and 1163</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS frustrated, always vigilant in its protest to de Man. Derrida speaks of "the value of event, of affection by the event that affects and changes things, and especially the past event, inscribed or archived." What emerges in Derrida's reading of de Man runs throughout the essays that constitute Material Events: a materiality of affect. An affect no longer consigned to the excesses of the body, politics, art, and science, but a constitutive affect, an affect-machine, that makes possible the readings that continue to inhabit the afterlife of de Man. The affects, as varied in this volume as the subjects they speak to, come to serve as forms of materiality and inscription that are mnemotechnological, historial, alive-after. Alive, after all. Derrida closes with a lament, but also a declaration, signed, as it were, in the materiality of a differance that calls forth and to de Man, even as it responds to him. Derrida leaves the trace of his call on a machine, an answering machine that will eventually summon its absent host: "I am so sad that Paul de Man is not here himself to answer me and to object. But I can hear him already-and sooner or later his text will answer for him. That is what we all call a machine. But a spectral machine. By telling me I am right, it will tell him he is right. And sooner or later, our common innocence will fail to appear to everyone's eyes, as the best intentioned of all our machina- tions. Sooner or later and virtually already, always, here now." University of California, Irvine AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT Douglas Brode, Shakespeare in the Movies. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. 257 pages. As its subtitle announces, Douglas Brode's Shakespeare in the Movies: From the Silent Era to Shakespeare in Love aims to situate the recent vogue in film adaptations of Shakespeare. It is a truly massive undertaking. Brode's book is part film-encyclopedia and part critical study; he discusses a great many films, from Oscar winners to limited release rarities, but throughout the book there is no mistaking his critical position. Brode addresses himself to a popular audience of non-specialist readers, gesturing only briefly and unevenly to scholarly debate, but not so much to inform the uninitiated as to dismiss it altogether. Academics, according to Brode, are those from whom Shakespeare must be "rescued" so that he can be "returned to the masses who have established Gentle Will as the most beloved author of all time" (241). He argues that filmmakers who produce popular, accessible versions of Shakespeare's plays are able to bridge the divide that separates his work from the "common man" (147) for whom it was originally written and who can uncover its "essential meaning" (147). The culture industry becomes, in Brode's study, the engine of cultural memory as it performs a kind of restorative labor that cuts through the obfuscations of deconstructionists, psychoanalysts, and anyone else who introduces needless complications.
