JACKSON. (Anthropological Papers, Volume II. Bureau of Research in the Social Sciences, Study No. 27. The University of Texas Publication No. 3809, Austin, March 1, 1938.) In order to understand better the relative importance of this new book and its place in the literature of Indian pictographs it may not be inopportune to consider briefly the historical sequence of the studies on this subject. There seem to have been two more or less distinct periods of interest in Indian picto- graphs, both of which witnessed general as well as areal studies. In the older series are Bruff's studies of the petroglyphs of the Nevada Range, Green's Rock Inscriptions of Johnson County, Arkansas,505 and especially the master- ly memoirs of Garrick Mallery.506 These general studies. pretending to cover the entire subject before detailed field work was done, left large areas without proper consideration-a condition that the more recent studies remedy, since they include less philosophy but more actual field work scientifically presented. For more than a generation this secondary, yet interesting, culture mani- festation seenis to have been neglected by American archaeologists. Then came the work of Fewkes in the Southwest during the 90's and in Puerto Rico (1903), and that of Emmons in southeastern Alaska (1908). More than ten years later, Kidder and Guernsey published some pictographs from northeastern Arizona in Bulletin 65 of the Bureau of American Ethnology. Then we have the more recent series, comprising valuable works on limited areas, including the work of Strong and Schenk,507 Erwin,508 Steward,509 and Renaud.510 606 Published in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1872 and 1881, respectively. 506 In the First, Fourth and Tenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Eth- nology. 607 "Petroglyphs near the Dalles of the Columbia River."

E. Pearce, an excellent work which crowns several years of pains- taking research, completing and systematizing the results already obtained by the author and other writers, and placing Texas by the side of the other western states as having a wealth of recorded and published Indian pictographs. It is a valuable contribution to American archaeology and the study of aboriginal art. I wonder why the author, who has well defined and correctly used the terms "pictograph" and "petroglyph" has chosen for the title of his book, and has fre- quently repeated in it, the more popular, vague, and not entirely correct ex- pression "picture-writing"? Following a short "Editor's Note" by Pearce and acknowledgments to numerous persons who assisted the author in his long task comes a worth-while "Introduction," giving information as to the number and distribution of sites with pictographs, and as to the types. In this connection, would it not be more precise to use the term "incised" or "graved" instead of "carved" to describe this class? The book is divided into nine parts of uneven length and importance. By far the most important is Part I, covering some 310 pages, which presents a sys- tematic inventory and descriptive catalogue of "Rock Pictures on Bluffs, Cave Walls and Boulders." It is profusely illustrated by photographs and line draw- ings of features which, by reason of position, light, degree of preservation, or other consideration, are not fit subjects for photography. There are also some views of the sites, and a few full-page colored plates of scenes or pictographs of particular interest. This is, of course, the best way of giving the reader a more vivid and exact idea of the actual appearance of these aboriginal paintings. Among them may be mentioned a hunting scene from Val Verde County re- calling similar pictographs from rock shelters of eastern Spain and Bushman 511 His work covers the Big Bend region and is treated in papers in the Publications of Texas Folk-Lore Society, American Anthropologist, and Texas Archeological and Paleon- tological Society. 612 In Art and Archaeology (1926), West Texas Historical and Scientific Society, Publication No. 2, and Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society (1929-30-31). 513 Field Reports on Pictograph and Petroglyph Sites in West Texas.

Part II, only three pages long, deals with the doubtful category of tree drawings, of which Jackson says "there remains in Texas no known authentic case of Indian paintings or carvings on trees." Part III, in the space of twenty- five pages, presents "Pictures on Movable Objects," proving that the author accepts, as I do, the broader definition of pictographs as being pictures made on any kind of material. A very short Part IV treats late and historic painting in two pages. Then comes the important Part V, the most interesting for the general reader and especially for the student of pictographs, because it presents and dis- cusses the "Classification and Distribution of Design Elements." The author shies away from the use of big scientific words that give a clear-cut classification, such as "anthropomorphic," "zoimorphic," and "skeuomorphic" with the proper subdivisions. All human figures are presented under the heading "Con- ventionalized Human Figures" and there is no sub-title for realistic human representations. It seems illogical to interrupt the orderly presentation of body forms and parts to insert headdresses and feather decorations between position of the arms and phallic representations and human hand and foot prints. The interesting group named "Mission and European Influences" is poorly sub- divided (for "teepee," why not "tipi"?) since all could be grouped under the generic term "skeuomorphic." The sections dealing with "Lower Life" and "Other Forms of Life" could have been more systematically grouped under the heading "zo6morphic," with appropriate headings for mammals, birds, rep- tiles, and insects and subdivisions as needed. A more logical and scientific pres- entation would be more fitting for a subject relatively so complex and for a work otherwise so well done, and would permit a more ready comparison with similar studies of pictographs elsewhere. In spite of these minor criticisms, the work is of high quality. The following three sections are treated very briefly. Part VI, covering ma- terials and methods, suggests that various techniques may have been em- ployed by different tribes. Part VII disposes of the important questions of age and authorship. The author lists six criteria such as any prudent and critical archaeologist would use in attempting this kind of work-some of them have been employed with success for the palaeolithic caves and rock-shelters of Europe. In treating the equally difficult problem of interpretation, in Part VIII, Jackson accepts the meaning of a few of the pictures as self-evident, and concedes that a satisfactory interpretation of all the rest of them is conjectural or even impossible. He has no illusions concerning the relative importance of most of the drawings, which are often trivial and without historical significance. Nevertheless in the eyes of the archaeologist who collected them they "are the first attempts at art in Texas. They reflect the customs, beliefs, superstitions, 358 [4, 1940</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS longings, and accomplishments of a primitive early race. [The word 'Indians' would be better there.] . . .Their existence throws light on the processes of primitive mentality .... They are held now to be the earliest crude forms of writing, as well as the first forms of painting and sculpture." This may be true if the word "writing" is accorded its broadest meaning; as to sculpture, I do not recall any mention of it in the whole book-drawing, painting and engraving, yes, but no sculpture. I agree with the author in asserting that comparisons of these expressions from various areas, and especially from adjoining regions, might bring to light data regarding migrations, culture contacts, or similarity in religion and the psychology of art. His comparison of rock pictures and pottery designs could be done elsewhere. Although the conclusions, eleven numbered paragraphs in Part IX, cannot be reported, one will be quoted as giving a clear view of estimation of ages. "The ages of the oldest pictographs may not go back further than 1500 years. Most of them appear to be much more recent. Perhaps the majority are not older than 500 years, with some not more than 100 years." A good bibliography and index close the volume. It is hoped that this review of Jackson's work, following the divisions of the book step by step, will give some idea of the extensive amount of field work done by the author, and of the systematic presentation of the results of his research. Text and illustrations are praiseworthy. It is a task well accomplished, and one that should serve as an inspiration to archaeologists to attempt the same thing in their respective regions or states.
