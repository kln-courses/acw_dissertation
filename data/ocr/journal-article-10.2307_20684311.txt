<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jason Schneiderman Af\^&gt; Notes on Not Writing *l ^ a Column Revisiting The Changing Light at Sandover Preamble The Changing Light at Sandover wasn't planned out as a long work, but rather accumulated itself into being. The final work is composed of two and a half books, followed by a coda. The first install ment, The Book of Ephraim, is a sequence of 26 po ems (an alphabetical sequence, ranging from A to Z), and it appeared as a section of Merrill's 1976 book Divine Comedies. In this section, James Mer rill and his lover David Jackson begin to converse with a spirit named Ephraim through their Ouija board. The following collection, 1978's Mirabell: Books of Number, found Jackson and Merrill being passed up the spiritual hierarchy from Ephraim to 741, one of a number of bat-like fallen angels, who begins to reveal to Jackson and Merrill the secret history and rules of the universe. 741, through the affection of Jackson and Merrill, metamorphs from bat to peacock, even as he goes from num ber to person. 741 is happily renamed Mirabell by his earthly friends at the board, fitting his trans formations. Mirabell ends with a revelation from the Archangel Michael that more lessons from higher authority will soon follow. Two years later, in 1980, Merrill published Scripts for the Pageant, in which the theology of the first two books is aug mented, collapsed, and revised. And then in 1982, Merrill added to the trilogy a coda titled Coda: The Higher Keys, renamed the entire work The Chang ing Light at Sandover, and printed it as a single volume. Three of the four iterations of the poem won a major award. Divine Comedies received the Pulitzer Prize in 1977; Mirabell: Books of Number received the National Book Award in 1979; in 1983 the National Books Critics Circle Award for poetry went to The Changing Light at Sandover. Although the work appeared over the course of fewer than ten years, the time periods of the po ems are vastly different. The events of Ephraim begin in 1955, when Jackson and Merrill were in their early thirties. By the end of the trilogy, they are in their mid-fifties. And their facility with the Ouija board went beyond the confines of this large poem. In 1992, they conducted interviews with Henry James and Alice B. Toklas for The Paris Review. In the first book, most of Jackson's and Merrill's friends and relatives are alive. They visit, make demands, chat. As the trilogy progresses, the Jackson-Merrill social circle is increasingly on the other side, and those who had questioned the board now speak through it. The final volume was a huge success, and at 560 pages, is an unusually large poem. The dust jacket of my copy boasts praise from Harold Bloom, The Nation, The New York Review of Books. In The San Francisco Review of Books, Thorn Gunn wrote of Ephraim and Mirabell, "I feel rather as if I were setting out to-review Ulysses in 1922_It is not that they are so difficult to understand as that they are so unprecedented, their ambitions so high ..." (153). On the publication of Sandover in its entirety, David Lehman in Newsweek said that "The result may well be the greatest long poem ?and, at 560 pages, it is undoubtedly the longest great poem?an American has yet produced" (70). I. In one of the very last scenes of The Changing Light at Sandover, James Merrill and David Jack ^^^^^^^^^BPfL 'pL ??? j???^^^^K?^^^^^^^^^^? son are told by the spirits to prepare for a literary salon with the 26 greatest writers of all time. They are to set up the chairs in roughly the same ar rangement as the letters on their Ouija board, and in each chair will be the most important writer to have a name beginning with that letter. So from Austen to Yeats (the last three seats are left va cant), the apartment is to be filled. The spirits dic tate who will be coming, how to arrange the room, how wonderful it will be. The spirits are coming for a poetry reading to be given by Merrill. In the last line of the book, Merrill begins to speak for his spirit audience, and he ends with his opening. The word he begins his reading with is the first word of the Sandover. By this late point in the epic, the spirit world's VIP treatment of the Jackson-Merrill household has become standard. What had started out with tentative steps and hesitant revelations has de volved into the full reveal. Merrill is a prophet sent to save the world from nuclear holocaust; Merrill is made from the (second) finest stuff of the universe; If there's an important writer, Mer rill's hand has been guided by him. In the first book, the spirit Ephraim is secretly in love with Merrill and Jackson, peeping from the beyond as they swim?but the affair is tentative and diffi cult. Ephraim initially demands their souls, but then retracts it as a joke. In book two, urgent mes sages come from the beyond. Mirabell tries to guide them through the intricacies of the heav enly hierarchy, but is constantly being censored, punished, and corrected. But by Scripts, Merrill and Jackson have been chosen as the voice of God (for biology) to communicate the truth of the universe. The revelations begin to feel like a lot of parties and back patting. Merrill isn't just univer sally loved?he's actually loved by the universe. The Changing Light at Sandover jumps the shark roughly between books two and three. The dan gers that stalked the lovers in the first books have been replaced by an endless red carpet rolled out from the spirit world, and the mythology?care fully built up in book two?begins to crumble un der its own weight. Reincarnation is an idea in troduced in book one, but the levels of it become absurd. Maria Mitsot?ki (a dead friend) constantly complains that W. H. Auden has left her to go be with Plato, but then she reveals that she is Plato? And then after a visit by the nine muses, it turns out that they are all really just Maria Mit sot?ki? The revelations become less than revela tory. Ephraim is really Michael. The Mohammed they spoke with was actually a parody Moham med. The "no accidents" clause is revoked. The characters lose their distinctive voices?and how could they not with the boundaries of identities melting away. The recently dead making cameos increase in number and fame?including visits by Maria Callas and Elizabeth Schwarzkopf. But that descent into recursive celebrity name dropping is also marked by a certain abdication on Merrill's part. The spirits speak more and more and Merrill speaks less and less. We just find Merrill leaving things up to the afterlife? as long as they can fill the page, why should he? But this also seems to reflect the way of all things. The more notable change is that Jackson and Mer rill are almost entirely absorbed within the spirit world. Ephraim and Mirabell pitch a tension be tween the living and the dead, between the mate rial and the spirit. There are obligations, travels, surgeries, friends, parties, parents, and jobs that pull Jackson and Merrill away from the board. In Scripts, the connection to a social sphere is al most entirely severed. The ending seems to em body this development perfectly?it recasts the book as spoken entirely \o the dead. What seems to hang over the Scripts is Mer rill's age?Jackson's as well. There's a sense that, everything that is going to get accomplished has been accomplished. Merrill set out to be a famous writer, and now he is one. Jackson set out to be a famous writer and his novels languish in draw ers, unpublished. The potential for action and knowledge that drove the first book (and the lives of their thirties) have run out in the third because time is running out. Merrill and Jackson seem to have reached a point where there's just not enough time to change things. Without a mystery left to unravel, or a prophecy left to prophesy, the poem becomes a sequence of distracting parties, lack ing urgency, lacking joy, buoyed by charm and lit tle else (assuming you don't count the unicorn). Even though the final section is built around 25 lessons, the lessons feel rote, unilluminating. IL I first read Merrill for a craft class that Agha Sha hid Ali taught at NYU. Each week, having done the reading, I would come to class bewildered. Sometimes the explanations made sense. OK, so I missed that the speaker of the poem was a win dow talking to a mirror. Or a mirror talking to a window. But sometimes the explanations left me more confused than before.. Why write a poem where the first line rhymed with the last line, the second line rhymed with the penultimate and so on?11 still don't really understand the point of a rhyme if it doesn't even ghost itself into the read er's hearing, though now I have a great deal more respect for the poem. My own breakthrough with Merrill came while I was listening to a Nina Simone album. I liked her voice, but I was impatient. I wanted her to hit the notes a little sooner, to speed up th? tempo, to linger less. In reflecting on my frustration, I real SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2009 15</page><page sequence="2">ized that I wanted her to be someone else?which is impossible. If I wanted her voice, I would have to take the experience entire, to allow my chaf ing at her delays to be part of the experience. And once I trusted her to know what the experience should be, her voiced began to open up for me in entirely new ways. I stopped chafing and thrilled to my bondage. A week later I pull?d Merrill back off my shelf with the same determination to be patient and to trust. And Merrill's work began to amaze. At its own pace?a pace difficult to find in this Internet age?Merrill's poems are dazzling fields of play. Years after Shahid's class, I was looking for poems to teach in a workshop. One of my stu dents had asked me to structure the workshop around the question of "how to write," and Mer rill seemed like a good fit. He is a master crafts man, and his craft always inheres on the surfaces of his poems in visible ways. His prosody is never secret. It is never possible to reconstruct a writ ing process from the final product, but it is pos sible to see the choices that won out in the end. It is possible to see the accretion of craft, the care fully constructed cadences. Certainly, the ques tion of how something was written is impossible to answer from the final product. But my hope was that by looking at the finished veneer, we'd be able to imagine our way into that process, and that imagined process, whether Merrill's or not, could become our own. "How did he get here?" seems a valid question for budding poets. Imagining a way to write can easily become a way to write. Because workshops are so focused on the sin gle poem, I thought that it would be interesting to look at a long poem. I had wanted a large work ?something along the lines of Paradise Lost or Leaves of Grass?something that we could read to gether as a group for 10 weeks and neither tire of nor be overwhelmed by. I wanted to look at sus tained writing over a long period of time. The Changing Light at Sandover easily lends itself to a division into five parts, so we could read Sandover on even weeks, different authors on odd ones. And Merrill did not disappoint. Merrill's poems constantly call attention to their own composition. In one scene, Merrill and Jackson have been re ceiving a lesson directly from the Archangel Mi chael. Michael's teaching is that in addition to the five senses of people, God also possesses intu ition, judgment, command and pronouncement. At the end of the lesson, Michael announces his exit in the small caps that denote Merrill and Jack son's transcription of the Ouija Board: "so next we don the glad array / of all our senses to meet the day" (352). W. H. Auden now gets on the line, to complain about Michael's verse. He criticizes before trying out a revision of his own: entre nous my dear he's not improving: next we don our senses in glad array &amp;. meet here again on another day (352). Merrill responds, "That too could stand some work, if I may say so" (352). But Michael, arch angel that he is, comes back and asks the two of them what they're talking about. Merrill stut ters, flustered, but Michael seems more impe rious than offended: "my verse not m?tered? not in rhyme? then pray / make sense of it yourselves another day." Then Auden and Mit sot?ki swoon over the dreaminess of Michael, whom they agree is much cuter than his archan gel brother, Gabriel. Interestingly, Auden did have something to say about these sorts of voices from the other world. In his 1967 lecture "Words and the Word," the fi nal installment of his T. S. Eliot Memorial Lec tures, he distinguishes between the voices of the Greek gods and the "voice" of monotheism's God: As human beings, we speak in sentences made up of a number of words, and we must speak them in a particular language. So speak the gods in the Iliad, both to each other and to men. They make speeches, and they make them in Greek. But when the Elohist makes God say to Abraham: "Take Isaac, thine only begotten son whom thou lovest," we are not to think that He brew is the language spoken by God or that Je hovah, like Zeus, has vocal chords which make audible sounds. (116) Auden continues this line of thought: "... the Christian theologian is placed in the difficult position of having to use words, which by their nature are anthropomorphic, to refute anthro pomorphic conceptions of God. Yet when such anthropomorphic conceptions of God are verbally asserted, he must speak: he cannot refute them by silence" (119). For Auden to be correcting and re writing the language of Michael would put Auden on the side of the polytheist?making Michael, like Zeus, an embodied being with vocal cords? even if his voice comes through a cardboard fre quency onto the Ouija board. But then one ought not be surprised that Au den's theological ideas would be changed by dying. As Auden pointed out in life, to speak from beyond is to speak, and if the shade of Auden is to be every bit as anthropomorphically intact as Odysseus's mother in The Odyssey, then why not let God? or God (for Biology) in Merrill's theology?be as embodied as the rest? Although, for embodied spirits, only Ephraim gets to enjoy the sensual side of having nerve endings, and only once, early on in the volume. Merrill's Auden spirit even regrets poems and beliefs via the Ouija board, regretting EJ BEBE E tu vi / m %%% Le^J %%% MARGIE THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POETRY www.margiereview.com 9th Annual "Strong (Rx) Medicine" BEST POEM CONTEST postmark deadline: oct. 31. 2009 ist prize: $1,000/Publication judge: SALLY VAN DOREN Winner of the Prestigious "Walt Whitman Award" GUIDELINES: Submit 3 unpublished poems (60 line limit per poem) &amp; $15 entry fee payable to MARGIE, Inc.

But to return from my somatic digression, what I want to focus on in this passage is how Mer rill performs what looks like a writing process. Or how he performs on the page what looks like a record of revisions. We are given two versions of a statement, along with encouragement to con tinue working on the content until it can find the right form. Michael's statement is fairly banal? he's just saying goodbye and letting them know that he'll back tomorrow?but the discussion over how to say goodbye is remarkably fraught. Hier archy, hurt feelings, revision, and desire all get mixed up in this clear display of the conflict be tween the possibilities of how something might get said and the actuality of something that has al ready been expressed. Auden's own formula from his lecture: "we do not know exactly what we are going to say until we have said it" (122). So writ ing and revision is not only a process of reshap ing, but a process of discovery. Much of Sandover is concerned with things that did not get written. The first book is largely about a novel that was never completed. Much of the la^t book is about writing the second book. Merrill continually offers the reader material that never made it to the page, except that if you are reading about lost material, then it is not lost. Merrill's books?whether or not it was his process?sug gests that his writing is a kind of palimpsest, that the various histories of what he's writing are pres ent in what you are reading. In fact, this is where we begin to feel the tension emerging between writing and not writing. ML Stephen Yenser, in his excellent book The Con suming Myth, addresses the way in which Merrill is always on both sides of every concern: "Mer rill has been a writer uncannily alert to reversals and doublings. The duplicate and the didymous, the obverse and the inverse, the geminate and the specular are part and parcel of his art" (4). Yenser quotes Merrill: "Anything worth having's had both ways" as a starting point for understanding Merrill's serious flippancy. And this would seem to be the case. Because the more Merrill calls at tention to his writing process, the more we be come aware of what Merrill isn't writing. In the first section, he's quite literally not writ ing the novel that he tells us he tried to write. But slowly, the messages from the other side in crease, and we're aware that Merrill's writing is not writing at all, but transcription. Dictation. Da vid Jackson is given the epithet "hand" while Mer rill is "scribe"?and Jackson is clearly the lower order. Whenever they are being evaluated, Merrill is just below Auden, Jackson just below Merrill. So Auden is platinum, Merrill silver, Jackson an alloy of silver and tin. In this way, it becomes clear that Jackson's position as medium makes him less valuable than Merrill's position as composer. Or rather, it's not that one can do without the transla tor, but the translator doesn't get to decide foreign policy. And yet Merrill is simultaneously insisting on his role as compositor while refusing that role. The more the reader believes in the voices of the spirits, the less the reader believes in Merrill's role as writer. If we accept the voices as direct commu nication, then Merrill is frequently downgraded to Jackson's role. One begins to wonder why the spirit world needs such a glorified secretary. The search for material is a problem for all writ ers. As has frequently been pointed out, the best books that bear witness to history were written by people who were writers before they went to war, survived the holocaust, etc. Borges's famous for mulation is that we have nothing but our dreams and our childhood to go on, though one wouldn't necessarily guess that from reading the work of Borges. I spoke to a colleague who had been ?n a search committee to hire a poet, and what had struck him was the length to which young poets write "project" books in order to secure enough material to cover 60 pages?whether the proj ect has to do with a historical text, a biography, a scientific concern, or a personal event. Merrill's seeming solution is perfect in that it seems exter nal and internal simultaneously. He simply gives us the voices that have intruded on his life. He simply needs to fill in the spaces between tran scriptions. In an interview with Helen Vendler he admits his initial feeling was that using the voices in his poems "would be a kind of plagiarism, from whom I don't know, of what I don't know." As the project moves forward, the voices of the spirits take up more and more room, and Mer rill's Merrill voice begins to feel more like con nective tissue between posts from the spirit world, and less like a speaker who allows in other yokes. Some of the best moments in the book come from the tension between the suave, camp charm of Merrill and the urgency of the voices when they first emerge. The very first lines of Sandover con stitute a kind of anti-urgency: Admittedly I err by undertaking This in its present form. The baldest prose Reportage was called for, that would reach The widest public in the shortest time. Time, it had transpired, was of the essence. Time, the very attar of the Rose, Was running out.... (3) One would be hard pressed to find form and con tent that are in greater opposition (well, assum ing we don't start looking in political speeches). What more leisurely expression of urgency can there be than "Time, it had transpired, was of the essence"? But the voices that come from beyond Language is a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, while all the time we long to move the stars to pity.

When God begins to speak through the board, the urgency is amazing: IVE BROTHERS HEAR ME BROTHERS SIGNAL ME ALONE IN MY NIGHT BROTHERS DO YOU WELL I AND MINE HOLD IT BACK BROTHERS I AND MINE SURVIVE BROTHERS HEAR ME SIGNAL ME DO YOU WELL I AND MINE HOLD IT BACK I ALONE IN MY NIGHT BROTHER I AND MINE (360) Compared to Merrill's speech, we understand how urgent and clear God B's need to communicate is ?and yet in order for the suspension of disbelief to continue, we can't believe that this is Merrill's creation. In the interview, Merrill maintains that he did progressively less shaping of the text as the work progressed; the voices simply came straight off the board in verse by the end. So if these tran scripts are sheer reportage, how much has Merrill actually written? Is one answer to the question of how to write, to not write at all? IV. As the course went on, I ceased having much ex pectation of my students doing the reading? which was fine. One of the joys of private stu dents is not having to grade them. If they don't do the reading, I have no obligation to mete out punishment. These were all adults with full-time jobs and families?it's not as though they were skipping the assigned reading to spend more time with their Wii. I encouraged them to dip in and out?to consider the poem less a marathon to be run than a pool to be dipped into. I provided the narrative thread, kept them up to date on the com ings and goings of the visitors and the build-up of theological rules. I did close readings of various passages. I checked out the assertions on physics. Here is an e-mail I sent to a friend with a Ph.D. in physics: In The Changing Light at Sandover, James Mer rill receives this formula (through spirits, via a ouija board) for anti-radiation: MO / RA : 279 / SOD (SODIUM COMPOUND, MO MAGNESIUM OXIDE) I just wanted to confirm that this makes no sense. He responded: To me it makes no sense. But without context one cannot be sure. He could have copied it out of some obscure handbook. Which was enough for me to disregard it as a plan for when the bomb drops. I looked up the various religious references and names in Robert Polito's highly useful A Reader's Guide to James Merrill's The Changing Light at Sandover. I found reviews from when the poem had been published in its various iterations, and found that the poem's criti cal reception was largely glowing, and that it is of ten discussed as an apocalyptic poem. I tend to encourage my students to be irrever ent?to find the flaw in the diamond and to re gard the flaw as the most interesting part. In my own training, I found that my favorite teachers were the one who didn't simplify the text, but who made it more challenging. Because I often feel so dense myself, it's comforting to be told that what one didn't understand is in fact strange. But also, finding the strangeness in what is said makes the text itself important. If Freud or Whitman or Mil ton can simply be paraphrased, then why bother reading them?why not stop with the "very short introduction" series and call it a day? But if the original text is something that will continue to fascinate, something that can increase its strange ness with fractal-like expansions, then the origi nal retains its value. And to recall Auden's earlier point, only monotheism's God is allowed to speak in pure information?the rest of us are stuck in the stickiness of human language. I would even be willing to say that struggling with language is what makes us human. I tried to get my students to see how the voices from the beyond were being treated differently as the book goes on. At first, they are tentative and timid. One has the constant sense of danger and risk in the first contacts with Ephraim. Merrill even contacts a doctor who assesses Merrill and Jackson as needing to figure out why they need a Ouija board to communicate their deepest feel ings to each other. And the information from Ephraim is often upsetting: no souls came from hiroshima u know earth wore a strange new zone of energy Caused by? smashed atoms of the dead my dears News that brought into play our deepest fears (55) Though just as often, Ephraim brings comforting information about where friends and relatives are being reborn. Jackson and Merrill generally seem confirmed in most of their judgments. They are special; their friends are special. And of course the "no accidents" clause suggests a deserving quality to their respectively moneyed births. My own feeling is that the voices are approached in the first book, mastered in the second book and kitschified in the third book. If my insistence on the kitschiness of the third book seems harsh, check out the appearance of Unice the Unicorn.

Southern Illinois University J Carbondale THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">But I don't mean to dismiss the third book as not worth reading, nor would I say that the kitsch isn't brilliant camp and fun. And it would be unfair to ignore the power of the ending, when the spirits call upon them to break the mirror and leave the spirit world behind. (I think the best parallel is how the final season of Twin Peaks got really silly before returning to brilliance at the end). Meryl Streep famously said that she won't allow her re hearsals to be reviewed because her process looks like bad acting. I often encourage my students to give themselves the same perspective?the writ ing process often looks like bad writing. But Mer rill (Meryl? no accidents?) makes us believe that his process looks like good writing, in part by making it look like he hasn't written at all. Socrates looked forward to questioning the dead when he arrived in the underworld. In the Phaedo, Plato has him say, "I believe that in the next world, no less than in this, I shall meet with good mas ters and friends" (15). In the Apology, Socrates hedges a bit, but still expresses excitement about the possibility of conducting his Socratic method with the great spirits who populate the afterworld. Roughly in parallel to Socrates, the divide be tween here and the after-here that gets blurred by Sandover is the line that separates doing from not doing. The question is just how much impact the spirit world can have ori the material world. When Auden" starts to give instructions on where to find his final writings, he is punished for overstep ping his boundaries. Similarly, David Jackson's father is censored before he can tell them where the bank books are. But the progress of Sandover is towards the spirit world viewing Merrill more and more as a tool for their own devices?as a prophet. But Merrill is 3 terrible prophet as far as prophets go. He's no L. Ron Hubbard, drumming up converts. In fact the one person who truly be lieves in the voices from the Ouija board is a di saster. Merrill recounts "Milton's ghastly on the spot / Conversion complete with rival spirit / And breakdown, not long afterwards" (87). The ghost of Maya Deren may be able to send dreams to pre vent an American war with Cuba, but Merrill and Jackson can do little more than listen to the his tory of the universe. WTien Merrill asks Ephraim for the name of the baby his father's soul has been born into, Ephraim testily responds: WILL U NEVER LEARN LOOK LOOK LOOK LOOK YR FILL BUT DO DO DO DO NOTHING (38) Once the line between the spirit world and the material world has become one of action, the ques tion arises?what is writing? Isn't Ephraim's for mula threatened by our knowledge that even look ing is a form of interference? If speech is thought made visible, and writing is recorded speech (I'm tracing the Socratic ideas of Sandover), then in or der to keep the line between speaking and act ing in place, writing cannot be action. And if the spirits .are not allowed to act in this world, then it seems that the spirits can speak (and DJ can chan nel and JM can transcribe) as long as it won't result in direct action. It keeps that line in place, while also enforcing "writing" as a form of "not doing." In Derridian terms, one might say that this dis tinction of thought and action is ripe for decon struction?though Merrill is way ahead of me. Not only is Jacques Derrida David Jackson's acronymic inverse?JD and DJ?no accidents?but Merrill is already blurring the line. If the line weren't blurred, there wouldn't be so many censorings of the board. In setting up the difficult distinc tion, Merrill's entire poem becomes a meditation on precisely what it is that poetry can or cannot make happen. Auden is forbidden to try to manip ulate the afterlife of his affects in a direct way, but Deren can indirectly prevent a war. Merrill sets up the question and answers it both ways. Writ ing isn't simply action or inaction, but rather both and neither. Or, more satisfyingly to me, writing, speech and action are always proximate, at each other's edges, threatening to become one another. Persuasion and command are never as far apart as we might like to think. But whatever linguistic and logical knots this line of thinking may lead to, at the center of the paradox is Merrill, whose book represents a Herculean effort as well as a simple secretarial task. Alid again, we find Merrill as si multaneously one who writes and one who doesn't. Auden's lecture from when he was alive proves remarkably prescient: "The artist is a maker, not a man of action" (118). V. In Alison Lurie's memoir of the Jackson-Merrill romance, the ends of Jackson and Merrill were far worse than I would ever have imagined. In the fi nal years of their lives, Merrill and Jackson drifted apart?Jackson disgusted, by the endless fascina tion with the Ouija board; Merrill's fame making increasing demands on his time. Merrill takes up with Peter Hooten and produces a video based on the work called Voices from Sandover, which show cases Hooten's acting talents. According to Lurie, the final piece cost over $800,000 of James Mer rill's money (156). The video Qf Voices from Sando ver has production values that lie somewhere be tween a college production of Shakespeare and an episode of Dark Shadows. The low point is when talking lips are superimposed over a picture of Wallace Stevens's face?a technology you may re member from episodes of Clutch Cargo. But while it's always easy to find fault with the technology, of the past, the real problem is that the voices have more specificity on the page than they do on the stage. When Maria Mitsot?ki complains that Auden has "flown off to plato poor maman, now who'll/carry her books and walk her home from school?" it's quite charming as a metaphorical description of her afterlife. But when an actress is actually pouting on stage in her best Greek accent, the charm is lost. Still, the in terview that Helen Vendler conducts with Merrill following the production is fantastic. For me the most upsetting part of the production is that Mer rill uses the Christian pronunciation of Ephraim as "EE-frem." I'm far more attached to the Jewish pronunciation aef-RYE-im.w According to Lurie, Hooten isolated Merrill from his earlier coterie, taking umbrage at old friends calling him "Jimmy" instead of "Mr. Mer rill." It's an ugly portrait?Hooten comes off as a kept boy who fancies himself a Svengali. Back home in Florida, Jackson takes up with a series of toughs and hustlers who steal and scare away old friends. Faced with the choice between quitting smoking and lucidity (his brain is being starved of oxygen), Jackson smokes himself irito senile de mentia and fogginess. Merrill has AIDS; it seems unlikely that Jackson doesn't. As their lives slide further apart, they each descend into ugly prisons built partly out of vanity and partly out of time's cruel tolls on the human body and spirit. They die estranged and miserable, sick, fragile and irascible. VI. My own supposition that the book is a meditation ?n mortality is seriously challenged by the fact that Merrill completed two more volumes of po etry after The Changing Light at Sandover. And bio graphically speaking, it is those works that ought to be saturated with mortality?but they are not.

But in 1988, when The Inner Room was published, his HIV status was very much a death sentence. His final volume, A Scattering of Salts, published on March 14, 1995, came out five weeks after Mer rill's death on February 6 of that same year. But in that final book of poems lies the proper ending to The Changing Light at Sandover. Peter Hooten, interloper (to whom Merrill dedicated his 1988 volume of poetry), has disappeared, and Jackson is back on the scene. The Ouija board calls them back one last time in the poem "Nine Lives." As Jackson and Merrill worry about the cats that they're trying to adopt, Ephraim offers them the proof of the spirits' actuality and hon esty. DJ and JM are to go to a cafe and wait. The spirits will bring them the newly reincarnated Maria Mitsot?ki, now an eight-year-old Indian boy destined for a Nobel Prize. The two wait, but noth ing happens. The boy doesn't show. In perhaps the most understated literary outburst since Flan nery O'Connor's "Bailey turned his head sharply and said something that shocked even the chil dren," David Jackson is parenthetically described as he "from whom burst certain long-pent-up re proaches" (600). Merrill points out to Ephraim that now they have lost "the proof. The proof we've never had / Or, mind you, sought. Proof that you act in our theatre" (600). Which is odd, since ac tion has always been off limits. Still, clarifying that Ephraim cannot actually do anything in this world restores the boundaries be tween the living and the dead. Any braggart who claims to be able to act from the other side will be humbled, as Ephraim finally puts it, "mes chers we overestimated ourselves" (6oo). Once the other side can't act, our side?even as Merrill seems aware that he's not long for this side?is defined by action. Speaking, and by extension, the recorded speech that is writing, do not count as action. So in the end, the actions Merrill takes, with Jackson as his partner, are simply the quo tidian motions of domestic love, set on the page in Merrill's careful, and in these terms, immortal measures. Like Lurie?or perhaps because of Lurie?I want to see The Changing Light at Sandover as a love story. And in "Nine Lives" Merrill restores the centrality of JM and DJ to each other. The spirits which began as a bond between the two, but have turned into a third party, are finally ex punged. Called upon to deliver they do not, and the domestic settles back over Jackson and Mer rill, comfortably. The spirits have lost their abil ity to demand or command, and what is left is the daily work of living. My own belief is that love cuts out the bottom 30% or so of. human suffering, and if we mark the end of Sandover in this final book, we find Jackson and Merrill back where we always hoped they would be. But then a few po ems later, Peter returns. Cosmo the dog's "other Daddy" turns out to be named Peter (650). A few poems later, "Family Week at Oracle Ranch" finds Merrill at a kind of wellness/therapy facility, de scribed roughly as a benign version of the treat ment center that Julianne Moore finds herself in at the end of the movie Safe. But is the speaker there with Jackson or Hooten? The name of his partner is never mentioned. So if there was no reconciliation in life, at least there was in poems ?and the two take their places peacefully in the final collection. But I'm not quite ready to give up in my read ing of Sandover as a book that is shaped by an in creasing sense of mortality. Though I do want to temper my argument. I think that the confronta tion with death that I've argued for in book three is a successful one. Having confronted mortality, Merrill comes through it, and the final two collec tions reflect that knowledge of death that does not preclude creativity or work. In fact, they reflect a wisdom and a calm that seem impossible without the crisis brought about in Sandover. Lurie reports that in 1990 Merrill said to her, "I'm afraid Death is beginning to be interested in me" (169). Despite how clearly Sandover represents death's threshold as a two-way turnstile, it seems that outside the poems, JM confronted mortality in the traditional way, too. Coda At the end of the class, I had hoped for us to make a Ouija board and contact James Merrill and Ephraim, but it quickly became clear that that would be a bad idea. My own two experiences with Ouija boards have been mixed. Once a friend was so badly disturbed by contacting his grandfather that he kept me awake all night, and I had to catch a plane in the morning. He'd been operating the board with a witch, and while I hadn't been in the rpom during his conversation with the afterworld, I felt rather disgruntled at having to suffer the consequences. The other time, I was rather sin cerely trying to contact a spirit that seemed to be haunting me, but the planchette remained stub bornly still. I'd been hoping for a third option? something between nothing and panic, but I'm no James Merrill, and I suspected that we'd be left with one or the other. I'd started the class with a writing exercise in which my students paired off and took turns be ing a spirit voice. They'd write questions and then switch notebooks, writing in the small caps and shorthand abbreviations of Merrill's voice when being the spirit. But they found the exercise un productive in the end. Either the other voice spoke in the wrong register, offering the wrong world view for their own poems, or they wanted back the language they were giving away. I had hoped that they, like Merrill, would be able to experi ment with not writing, but not surprisingly, since they'd come to class to learn to write, they didn't want to not write. Merrill's success with Sandover rests on a sequence of paradoxes and an embrace of opposites. But for me, more than anything, it's a powerful meditation on not writing?on receiv ing text, or making text seem received. Carolyn Forch?, famously, in "The Colonel" says, "There is no other way to say this," but of course there's always another way.2 The genius of Merrill is to put the other way out of reach, even while making it visible. He shows us what could have been writ ten, while simultaneously refusing and accepting responsibility for the voices that (in varying de grees) compose the poem. When I first began to realize that I was thinking about Sandover as a meditation on not writing, I was a bit disturbed. Considering the cult of Merrill, it felt a bit blas phemous. But as I grew attached to the idea, it seemed like good news. I've never really believed in writer's block, mostly because it suggests a metaphor of a pipe way or a stream. If one can't write, in the world of "writer's block," then there's simply an obstruc tion that needs to be removed. It suggests that the natural state for all people is to be writing, all the time, with nary a pause. It suggests an end lessly renewing reservoir of writing that already exists inside each writer, which I find an absurd form of fatalism. Certainly, a discipline of writ ing is quite useful. David Lehman is instruc tively eloquent on the subject in the introduction to his book The Daily Mirror. But I find that "dry spells" (how I think of them?it's not that there's too much in the reservoir, but too little) can be quite calm and pleasant or quite frustrating and terrifying. Sometimes, when the poetry isn't com ing, I feel a bit like an actor between parts?trust ing that something will come along, but also on the lookout for the next project. In thinking about Merrill's masterpiece as a master work of not writ ing, I find a certain satisfaction in how work can come from unlikely, unexpected or feared places. In some ways, it's a conceptual work. We can't all run to our Ouija boards, but certainly, it's not that far from the experiments by Flarf or the Con ceptual Writers. As KG said in Poetry, "With so much available language, does anyone really need to write more?" (315). My hope is that yes?we'll always need to write more. But my other hope is that our writing will encompass more than we can initially Conceive, including not writing.

Toward the end of Mirabell, Merrill complains Here I go again, a vehicle In this cosmic carpool. Mirabell once said He taps my word banks. I'd be happier If / were tapping them. Or thought I were. (262) Again, in Scripts, in an interchange with Rob ert Morse, he tries to turn off the faucet: Stop, we must pack for Venice! And friends already Plead for no more big speeches in small caps. (499) Many writers describe those wonderful days when they are simply "in the zone"?when every thing seems primed and ready, and great work just flows right out. In the classical Greek notion of "inspiration" one literally inhales the Gods, or the muses work directly through the artist. Per haps "not writing" can also be that compulsion. Beginning writers are often asked if they could stop writing if they wanted to. (The correct an swer, Beginning writers, is "no.") In many ways, this compulsion to write, rather than the decision to write, is what I've meant by not writing. Which, paradoxically, would mean that our best writing is not. * Jason Schneiderman is the author of Sublimation Point. He lives in Brooklyn. Notes 1. The answer is that the form mimics the accretion of layers that builds a pearl; the poem is entitled "Pearl." 2. Mark Doty's definition of poetry, as he lays it out in Still Life with Oysters and Lemon, is instructively similar: "What makes a poem a poem, finally, is that it is unpara phrasable. There is no other way to say exactly this" (70). It's the very essence of poetry itself that Merrill is calling attention to. Works Cited Doty, Mark.
