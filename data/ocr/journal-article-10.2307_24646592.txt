<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LITERARY TREATMENT OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION: A MIRROR REFLECTING THE CHANGING NATURE OF AUSTRIAN LIBERALISM (1862-1899) Peter Horwath During the early 1860's Austrian liberalism became positively and repeatedly interested in the French Revolution as a subject for poetic treatment.1 Most of the pressing social, political, and spiritual problems of the age had their inception in, or were aftereffects of, that great historical upheaval of some 70 years before. The second half of the 19th century saw the liberalization of Austria, the transfer of much of the political and economic power to an increasingly monopolistic middle class, and the shattering "Börsenkrach" (1873). This period also saw a gradual proletarianization of the lower classes and an erosion of the Christian belief in a hereafter and of liberal Utopianism. All of these contributed in turn to a revolutionary atheism among the masses in the cities, an all paralyzing nihilism among the late liberal elements, and an intolerant ethnically based mysticism among the various nationalities of the Vielvölkerreich of the Hapsburgs. There are several reasons why Austrian literature prior to 1861 did not deal with the French Revolution as a political and social turning point in history. They were: 1) History could easily become a means toward specific political and social ends, and imperial absolutism would not have tolerated a propaganda in favor of constitutionalism, or of an absolute freedom of conscience; after all, the concepts "liberty" and "progress" came to mean for many national exclusiveness and anticatholicism. However, the tie which held this unique multi-ethnic state of the Habsburgs together was a universalism which had as its two pillars the dynasty and a "Gallicanized" Catholic Church; 2) neither the Imperial House nor the vast majority of the people could be reminded of Marie-Antoinette's fate without experiencing shock and grief. For many years, the French Revolution was identified in the public imagination with brutality and murder;2 3) in the period up to 1840, the metaphysical structure and the Imperial paternalism still had a great hold over the minds and emotions of 26</page><page sequence="2">the people; and 4) the reform activities of Emperor Joseph II (1780-90) were from the beginning psychologically the equivalents of the positive acts of the French Revolution, and there was for generations a rich belletristic literature with the emperor as the hero.3 To be sure, the death of Napoleon in 1821 had not only brought back memories of this "Attila," but also of a great dream which still was waiting to be realized. Austrian liberals were quite aware of the fact that the Restoration was possible only because of Napoleon's defeat, and being at odds with the politically rather sane, albeit socially ultra-conservative and discriminatory "System" of Metternich (1809-48), they soon took to celebrating the "große Korse," thereby laying the ground work for a favorable evaluation of the French Revolution. Christian von Zedlitz (1790-1862) was one of the first poets to celebrate Napoleon ("Geist des Grabes," "Nächtliche Heerschau," and "Das Geisterschiff" in: Totenkränze 1827; see also NZC, II, 754-756). One of the few positive references of the Vormärz to the French Revolution is found in Nikolaus Lenau's (1802-1850) epic poem Die Albigenser (1842). Lenau, however, is primarily concerned with religious freedom, and not with the plight of the socially and politically underprivileged lower classes. The present study deals with works which treat significant social, political, religious, or cultural problems and which reflect to a varying degree the preoccupation of the liberally oriented author with the issues of his own day (cf. NZC, IV, 1583),4e. g. the issues of nationalism and cosmopolitanism, of liberalism and ethnic extremism, of political idealism and realism; of evolution, guilt, and redemption; of sensualism, nihilism, and of illusion; and of the metaphysics of violence and anarchy. The Hapsburg Empire received its first constitutional government in 1861, and the liberals stayed in power until 1878. Along with liberalization came a greater degree of personal and corporate freedom, largely for the middle class, but also new social and ethnic problems. The liberal author Ludwig Eckardt (1827-71) seems to have been the first Austrian to use real or fictitious events of 1792-94 to reflect certain tendencies of his own age. In the early sixties, the problem of setting the direction of political liberalism was an 27</page><page sequence="3">important one. Eckardt joined the public debate by writing a drama, Weltbürger und Patriot (Leipzig, 1862). The question was whether the German states (and Austrian liberalism) should move along pan-European and cosmopolitan lines or along patriotic-conservative and ethnic lines. Ideally, Eckardt seems to have opted for a unified Europe, and practically, his hopes lay in the realization of the "großdeutsche Gedanke." The historical figure of Georg Forster of Mainz speaks for cosmopolitanism: He welcomes the intentions of Robespierre and the Jacobins to present European nations with the gift of freedom. And he is all the more pro-France, since Prussia represents political and social reaction. Forster envisions a Rhenian German state under the hegemony of France. It is the task of this state, which, incidentally, includes Alsace-Lorraine, to expand eastward through conquest. "Erhebt Euch doch," cries Forster, "über den beschränkten Horizont der Nationalität, und blickt in die Zukunft, die auf eine großartige politische Schöpfung - Vereinigte Staaten von Europa - hinarbeitet," and: "Was will es also sagen, wenn wir uns für einen Tag von Deutschland trennen und uns morgen unter einem europäischen Sternenbanner wiederfinden" (pp. 3 and 14; quoted in: Hirschstein, Die französische Revolution, p. 137). The Parisian Reign of Terror, however, destroys his political dream. In spite of the reaction at home which ensues with the ascendancy of Prussia, Forster prophecies a great future for the German people. The coming Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the subsequent exclusion of Austria from a confederation of German states proved to be a great shock to those who - like Eckardt - were hoping for a Germany which had a leading role for Austria. The pan-European ideal survived into the 20th century and its exponents were largely members of Vienna's freemasonry. Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach's (1830-1916) drama Marie Roland (Wien, 1867) about the downfall of the Gironde is a confession of the author and a credo of moderate Austrian liberalism at its noblest. In the view of the author, the French Revolution was inflamed by a thirst of millions for law and justice. Humanity fought this battle through one people - the French. To be a "Girondist" means above all inner nobility, altruism, and the avoidance of extremes: it implies the middle road between ancien regime and Jacobinism, between church allegiance and free 28</page><page sequence="4">thinking. In terms of Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach's own age, this means taking the road between Austrian absolutism of the 1850's with its commitment to church and the feudal and military establishment on one hand, and Czech, Hungarian, and German radicalism on the other hand — the road between an aristocratic oligarchy and a nationalistic and revolutionary mass. The author's liberalism accepts the dynastic principle wholeheartedly, without, however, rejecting either the cosmopolitan or the republican idea. As with Franz Grillparzer (1791-1872), "Gironde" meant for Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach being liberal in the face of ultra-conservative tendencies, and being Austrian and dynastic in view of a revolutionary nationalism. A "Girondist" ought to believe in God. Self-doubt is the prerequisite to a productive life. The author's "Girondists" have much in common with the Austro-German liberals. They were much too often abstract idealists5 and aestheticists, who confused a fervid and vigorous oratory with political insight and action, who indignantly rejected Realpolitik for a policy determined by noble sentiment and social blindness, and who, in their cultural and ideological narcissism, failed to become aware of the pressing social and religious needs of the age. Austro-German liberalism had culture, style and ideals. However, there existed a dearth of ideas and a lack of political vision and strength. Danton, the political opportunist, offers the Girondists what they needed: strength. They refused his offer. (They realized that he was interested only in his won career, and not at all in the welfare of the people.) No Danton approached the Austrian liberals. They soon collapsed under the hammer blows of the new mass movements. For the first time since Büchner, the French Revolution is treated with considerable originality and depth in a drama by Robert Hamerling (1830-89); The ideas and insights found in Danton und Robespierre (1870) are of a universal nature and do not reflect a single moment in history. Hamerling deals with the dichotomy between theory and practice which arises as soon as the world subscribes to an absolute good. He tells of the disastrous effects an idea has once a determined protagonist arises, a true believer, who feels himself chosen to participate in the unfolding of the plans of eternal powers. (This is an Hegelian idea which, having received the stamp of poetic approval from Lenau, is 29</page><page sequence="5">treated negatively by Hamerling.) Essentially, Hamerling unfolds the drama of incarnate and unrelenting fanaticism. Hamerling's age saw the masses assert themselves. The struggle for the rights of the individual had been won, at least for the bourgeoisie. Since economic liberalism tended to produce two classes, the haves and the have-nots, economic issues supplanted to a great extent those of a constitutional nature. The masses not only longed for security and Utopian conditions, but also for the experience of strong emotions. In the light of this, it is noteworthy that the French Revolution did not seem to have been for Hamerling a positive readjustment of society and the state. Apparently, it did not pave the road to something better. Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach' s world was still emotionally intact, even though spiritually brittle. Any latent pessimism inherent in the subject matter was held in check by the substantial Utopianism (a secularized version of Christian belief) and by the metaphysical note struck at the end of the play. In Hamerling's world, however, it is difficult to ascertain to what extent his cosmos is related to a supernatural world. His Danton und Robespierre reflects a polarization of the age into Fortschrittsglaube and Untergangsstimmung. The world of Austrian liberalism has cracked and the fissure appeared on the surface. All attempts to obliterate it eventually came to naught. It was in painting, and not in literature, that the age succeeded in covering up the fissure, in pretending that harmony and homogeneity were still a part of the philosophy of the liberal bourgeoisie. The Viennese painter Hans Makart (1840-84) simulated this experience by means of orgiastic mass scenes, melancholy eroticism and historical pomposity. Elements of this sort are from now on also part of the literature under discussion. The person of Hamerling's Dante embodies the last stages of a highly refined culture which had its inception in action, its culmination in sensual enjoyment and indulgence; and which, being now in the grip of inertia, succumbs to elementary forces. Danton, the Genußmensch, is in many respects a true Austrian representative of the upper middle class. Whereas Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach remained assured that extremes would not prevail for long and that the Gironde, cleansed, would return and work in the spirit of altruism, Hamerling's Gironde is gone forever, 30</page><page sequence="6">and therewith, the term "moderate" takes on a new connotation by referring to the party of Danton. The architect of the new world, Robespierre, is a dictator, and if he is able to solve the question of ownership and private property, the dream of Rousseau will be realized. To attain this goal, the end justifies the means, and the realists, the Voltaires and Diderots, must be slaughtered. As it is the case with an absolute sense of commitment, the individual is sacrificed for the happiness of mankind, and the world destroyed for a coming chiliastic age. It is, ironically, reality with its mediocrity and envy which shatters the Utopian dream. Hamerling's doctrinaire is not yet the dictator of the 20th century, for Robespierre still seems to have what one might call a latent Christian conscience: he entertains self-doubt in his singularity and mission, and in doubting he experiences a guilt which he cannot suppress. The speeches of the succumbing Robespierre are fraught with pessimism. In this play Hamerling seems to convey the notion that neither activism, sensualism, and rationalism (Danton), nor idealism and overzealousness (Robespierre), can survive by themselves (cf. NZC, III, 175). Epicureanism and rationalism end in prostration and cynicism, and Utopian fanaticism in sterility, inhumanity, something close to despair. Reacting to Robespierre's communist Utopianism, Danton, the realist, places his finger on one of the sore points: Ihr wollt alle Fesseln brechen und doch wieder den Staat nach einer dürren Verstandesschablone verknöchern. Euer Kommunismus wird die Welt bald so einförmig, poesielos und langweilig wie ein großes Arbeits- und Zuchthaus machen. Die Leute werden wie Galeerensträflinge alle im selben Kittel laufen. Ihr schafft die alten lustigen Feiertage ab und wollt dafür mit neuen staubtrockenen Allegorien den Pöbel begeistern - ihr streicht die Heiligen aus dem Kalender und setzt dafür Rübe, Pastinak und Sauerkraut hinein. Wie schal und ledern ist das alles! Die Franzosen sind zur Hälfte Barbaren, zur Hälfte Pedanten geworden.6 31</page><page sequence="7">Hamerling, however, did not foresee where such tendencies would lead to. Eventually, the masses, having gradually become estranged from organized religion, e.g. from Austrian Catholicism and its sensuous-Dionysian baroque elements, surrendered to forces which promised life to be an endless festival. The ground had been prepared for the "Blut-und Boden" mysticism of the ethnic extremists toward the end of the 19th century. In the 1870's the drama with its focus on political issues gave way to a literature which indicated a considerable interest in the social problems of the day. This type of literature about the French Revolution reached its artistic climax with Marie Eugenie delle Grazie's (1864-1931) epic poem Robespierre (Leipzig, 1894).7 Delle Grazie 's reputation among her contemporaries was so immense that she was classified with Shakespeare. In Robespierre the author presents the futile struggle of the idealists against nature's "right of the stronger." Hegel, H. Taine, Feuerbach, Marx, Darwin, Haeckel, and Carneri8 were delle Grazie 's spiritual and intellectual mentors. She comes to the pessimistic conclusion that man's ideals have no benevolent effects in the face of the workings of nature. Nature is devoid of ideas. Ideas are merely illusions which powerful nature casts back into nothingness (NZC, IV, 1585). Gone is the old Utopian belief of the liberals in the perfectibility of man and in the establishment of paradisiacal conditions in this world — at least along the lines of a rationalistically conceived scheme. Essentially, there are no values left. The author may be viewed as standing in the middle of a development that proceeded from the world of ideas and senses, and eventually will end in the world of illusion, blood4ust, and sexuality; as a matter of fact, soon with Arthur Schnitzler (1862-1931) sexuality becomes a meaningless and mechanical pastime, a Totentanz to distract the mind from experiencing the boredom and the absurdity of existence. For delle Grazie man has evolved from a lower animal form. He went beyond an instinctual existence by learning to observe, deduct, abstract, and relate. In his helplessness and weakness, man unfortunately placed anthropomorphic chimera and idols above himself, thereby surrendering his power to know and becoming a voluntary slave. By separating nature from spirit, and human 32</page><page sequence="8">existence from nature, man separated himself from other men. His individuation became his guilt (cf. Feuerbach; also Lenau'sFaws?, 1836). If man had tried to understand nature, he could have remained part of nature. He would have enjoyed the state of brotherhood in his awareness of the unity of all living things. According to delle Grazie, guilty is he who claims to act in the name of a higher being. Likewise, guilty is also he who sees in another man his saviour. This guilt may become the guilt of high and low alike. By approaching the French Revolution from the aspect of guilt, delle Grazie carries her interpretation of the causes and nature of that dramatic upheaval beyond a social analysis of a specific historical period and locality. In accordance with H. Taine, delle Grazie views the French Revolution above all as a social movement, as a struggle for justice. Eventually, this struggle became a political struggle for basic rights (NZC, IV, 1583f.). As soon as the ideals of liberty, equality and justice for all were connected with a Supreme Being, and as soon as a person was accepted as humanity's saviour, man's inhumanity to man came into play. By force of necessity, Robespierre, in his zeal to execute the alleged will of divine powers, pushed his people into a greater misery, and ended up by finding himself guilty of brutality and gross injustice. Robespierre is an archetypal character whose guilt is the guilt of all men. In him the great revolutionary ideals of justice and happiness for all have reemerged. In Christ they had found their most memorable embodiment. According to delle Grazie, the Christians martyrs who would die rather than accept imperial laws based on greed and injustice have been resurrecte-' over and over again, under different signs and with different names (for similar Hegelian views, see Lenau's Die Albigenser, 1842). Eventually the new ideas and articles of faith will prevail. With their codification as universally binding laws, however, corruption sets in and much of mankind will be excluded from benefiting from the new laws. Thereupon saviours will arise to enforce - amidst much bloodshed — these fervently pursued abstractions, e.g., the principles of universal justice and equality for all men. Hoping against hope, delle Grazie indicates that one day a purified Gironde may return: she envisions men with the strength 33</page><page sequence="9">of St. Just — but St. Justs with self-confidence, and not St. Justs who need an idol, a Robespierre. And she expects men who see in nature, and not in an empty abstraction, in God, the ultimate reality. Delle Grazie's monism envisions science as holding the key to the Garden of Eden: a scientific approach to nature will re-establish the lost harmony which once existed between man and nature. Altruism as the cornerstone of a society of free indiviuals will obliterate the need for the first Christians to be resurrected again. This was not the case with the first Girondists. They are characterized as those who, when talking of the happiness and welfare of the people, actually are thinking of their own advantage and gains. Is the author referring here also to her own contemporaries, the liberals? In the person of Lea, the poetic embodiment of delle Grazie, the conscious and subconscious Weltangst and nihilism of the poetess come to the fore. There are no values for her, there is no hope, there is no desire; there is only the need to plant the seed of doubt into the heart of those who believe in themselves and in something above themselves (Robespierre). Lea's sentiment indirectly also reflects what happened to Austrian liberalism when its doctrinary basis, the belief in the perfectibility of man, had collapsed.9 What delle Grazie seems to be saying in regard to the French Revolution is this: good eventually worked for evil and became evil. Ideas, being illusions, are in the last analysis weapons of destruction. Modern culture and civilization are not in harmony with nature, the ultimate reality; hence, modern culture leads to nihilism (Marat), and modern neurosis is a product of a civilization built on idealism (Charlotte Corday). Brutality of force and the passion of the masses lead nowhere (Danton). The ensuing explosion leads to dictatorship. Man's future lies in the biological and not in the cerebral sphere. Ferdinand von Saar (1833-1906), like Grillparzer and Ebner-Eschenbach, was in doctrinary and constitutional matters a moderate liberal. In at least one of his works psychopathic sexual compulsions appear as the driving force behind political activity. Saar often reflects in his works the representatives of the highly refined and over-sensitive upper classes, whose will and drives have been sapped. In his fragment of a drama Ludwig XVI (first act 34</page><page sequence="10">completed 1893; the first two acts published 1899), the King of France is a passive hero. "Sie haben," says Marie-Antoinette candidly, "jenen Mut, der nicht geschätzt wird- / Und nie und nimmer von der Welt verstanden:/Den Mut zu dulden und den Mut zu leiden-/Doch nicht den Mut der Tat" (p. 2f.; quoted in Hirschstein, Die Französische Revolution, p. 340). From the passive heroes of Saar to the resigned characters of A. Schnitzler, there is a short distance. For Ferdinand von Saar, the Republic was the breeding ground for innumerable little tyrants. Being absolutely protected by the law, the mass leads a cowardly life, and it is this kind of life which is far more devastating than the life of a crowned despot whom his dignity protects from baseness and vulgarity. The aristocrats in Arthur Schnitzler's (1862-1931) one act play Der grüne Kakadu (1899), however, seek out baseness and vulgarity. Having been removed by laws and privileges from toil, adventure and danger, they seek to experience vicariously murder, cruelty, and arson. In their world there is no meaning, no purpose, no love, and no security (cf. NZC, IV, 1757). The story takes place on the eve of the storming of the Bastille (July 14, 1789). Schnitzler's over-sensitive aristocrats seek insults instead of respect, sado-masochistic stimuli in place of erotic fancy, meaningless sexuality instead of involvement. Illusion is reality; play is seriousness. Whatsoever is real is illusionary; whatsoever is serious may be fictitious. We do not know anything about ourselves, nor do we know more about the world outside ourselves. Are our wishes coming from our hearts, or are they of the stuff a play is made of? Dreaming, waking, and living are inseparably interlaced. In the face of boring reality, man needs his illusions. Since there are no genuine challenges, he seeks synthetic adventures and cheap thrills. Truth is dangerous: once a man is stripped of his illusions, he will realize that his most cherished possessions are not his. The object of his love - power, property, and a woman - belongs to someone else. The Revolution is a meaningless event, because the future decidedly will not be better than the past. The members of the ancien regime are decadent, the middle class is sick and without convictions, and the man of the future is, individually and collectively, a morally bankrupt brute. The mass is totally uninteresting. Hamerling's Danton is to some 35</page><page sequence="11">extent the modern Epicurean whose pleasure-seeking led to inactivity and enervation. But there still was at times a strong vitality in him. Even the consciousness of such a vitality has disappeared in Schnitzler, so has the individual. In terms of man, idea, and political philosophy, Schnitzler's work is anti-Utopian. Schnitzler's psycho-dramatic novelette reflects very much his own age: an upper-class of leisure and refinement which has only inner conflicts to cope with. The new force, the anonymous mass (social and ethnic), seems to act under a blind compulsion to express violent emotions, emotions which, ironically, the upper classes in vain tried to experience. In one way or another, Schnitzler's Der grüne Kakadu is the death-song of Austrian liberalism. Within a few years after its appearance, Austrian liberalism was swept away by elementary forces from the left and from the right, with each new force offering a new Utopia.10 After Schnitzler, Austrian liberalism, having lost contact with the outer reality, moved inward to free the psyche from the Babylonian captivity of a tyrannical and exclusive rationalism - only to get bogged down in the struggle with equally tyrannical and subconscious powers. Some of those who found themselves betrayed by rationalism found pleasure in the "blood and soil" myth of the ethnic extremists. Strangely enough, the activist literature of this group ignored the French Revolution. The Austrian Adolf Hitler devotes one single line in his Mein Kampf (17 Aufl., 1943, p. 609) to Robespierre, Danton, and Marat together, and not one word to the French Revolution as such. Robespierre, Danton, and Marat appear at being something on the level of a Bürgerschreck, that is, as a terror to a non-heroic bourgeoisie. In summing up one might state that the ancien regime survived in the German speaking part of the Habsburg Empire till the early 1860's when a liberal movement came to the fore which traced its spiritual ancestry to the Gironde. Within a generation of its political and doctrinary ascendancy, bourgeois liberalism waged a losing battle against socialist, nationalist, and nihilist forces, forces which, ironically, also had their origins in the French Revolution. The whole drama was accompanied by a literature which in the course of four decades focused on different aspects and different personalities of the French Revolution. In the beginning the 36</page><page sequence="12">sympathy rested with the ideals of the Gironde. Eventually, literature became interested in other, more radical aspects of the French Revolution and came to reflect the uncertainties and the strife of its own age. There seems to be a shift from the individual to the mass, from the constitutional sphere to the social arena, from optimism to nihilism, from refined bourgeois sensualism to eroticism and sado-masochism, from reality to dream and inertia, and from constitutional evolution to revolutionary socialism or nationalism.

For detailed information and character analysis, see, e.g., Hans Hirschstein, Die französische Revolution im deutschen Drama und Epos nach 1815 (Stuttgart, 1912), and Nagl, Zeidler, Castle, Hrsgg., Deutsch-Österreichische Literaturgeschichte III and IV ien, 1899-1937). This latter work is cited in the text as NZC. 2. Franz Grillparzer (1791-1872) tells of a favorable and horrifying pastime of his chilhood: playing a march on the piano, and imitating in the course of his playing the swishing sound of the falling blade which beheaded Louis XVI. Sämtliche Werke IV (München, 1960-65), S. 14f., 27f.; for Grillparzer's remarks on the French Revolution, see II, S. 1141 f.; III, 981, 988-990, 1001; also IV, 538, 555, 710. Grillparzer mentions this musical pastime twice, in 1822, and many years later, in 1853! Even though he was a monarchist, Grillparzer welcomed the achievements of the French Revolution (NZC, IV, A. 1108), notably the destruction of the privileged estates. In the early 1790's news about developments in France were received very positively by the Austrian middle class (see, E. Wangermann, From Joseph II to the Jacobine Trials, 2nd ed. (London, 1969). In 1793, however, a persiflage appeared reflecting the new reactionary course of the government: Joseph Franz Ratschky's Melchior Striegel: Heroisch-episches Gedicht für Freunde der Freiheit und Gleichheit. 3. A contemporary and subject of Leopold II saw in the emperor a continuator of the great reform program of Joseph II: "I take my stand ... by the side of Your Majesty.. . . The Americans and the French have made good laws as a result of bloody violence. Your Majesty has made good laws which all enlightened men admire, without any revolution" (quoted by E. Wangermann, From Joseph II to the Jacobine Trials, p. 90). This note was written around 1792; within a matter of months political and social reaction set in. 4.

Quoted by Adalbert Schmidt, Dichtung und Dichter Österreichs im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, I (Salzburg, 1964), p. 162. 7. This type of literature seems to have had its inception with Minna Kautsky's (1837-1912) drama Madame Roland (1878). I have not been able to locate an edition of this work. Minna Kautsky was the mother of Lenin's greatest Marxist foe Karl Kautsky (1854-1938). Karl Kautsky was the leading theoretician of the II. International (see, NZC, III, 906). 8. B. von Carneri was the Utopian par excellence among the Austrian liberals: "Ganz wird die Menschheit ihren Namen erst verdienen und auf der Bahn der Sittlichkeit wandeln, wenn sie keinen anderen Kampf kennt denn Arbeit, keinen anderen Schild denn Recht, keine andere Waffe denn Intelligenz, kein anderes Banner denn Zivilisation." Sittlichkeit und Darwinismus (Wien, 1871); quoted in NZC, III, 1600f. 9. After a strongly anti-bourgeois and pro-socialist period, delle Grazie returned to the faith of her youth under an almost "dämonischer Drang" (quoted in NZC, IV, 1942). This was in 1912 on the occasion of the Eucharist Congress in Vienna. - A contemporary of delle Grazie, the poet Richard von Kralik (b. 1852), escaped despair and ennui by also returning to orthodoxy. Kralik came to reject Darwin's notion that mankind existed for the selection of the fittest; he came also to reject the idea that existence was a form of punishment, as the doctrine of the transmigration of the soul implied; moreover, he could not view with Schopenhauer and E. von Hartmann human existence as a defection from an unconscious state, or as a dejection from the state of non-being. According to Kralik it is not a malicious fate, or a devastating idea, or mere material, pyschological, or judiciary deficiency that leads to war and violence. This world is for him a stadium where men prove their valor and goodness to eternal powers. After the strenuous encounter the worthy are bestowed with the wreath of eternity. Viewed sub specie aeternitatis, the French Revolution was a dance of the spheres around the Throne of God; it was an ordeal during which men had their chance to decide for good or evil (Die Revolution, 1904-1096; 7 dramas). 39</page><page sequence="15">10. The most recent Austrian poetic treatment of the French Revolution comes from the pen of Fritz Hochwälder (b. 1911): even though the cruel person may be removed from the scene, the compulsion inherent in fear continues to beget evil (Der öffentliche Ankläger, 1948). 40</page></plain_text>
