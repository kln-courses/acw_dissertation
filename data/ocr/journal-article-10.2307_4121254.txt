<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANIMAL TEXT: Message and Meaning in Television Advertisements Jennifer E. Lerner University of Virginia Linda Kalof George Mason University We studied the dominant messages about animals in television commercials and the ways these messages might be subject to alternative readings. Six primary themes cap- tured the portrayal of animals in the advertisements: animals as loved ones (e.g., a member of a family), as symbols (representation of logos or ideas), as tools (using ani- mals for human use or consumption), as allegories, as nuisances, and animals in nature. Many of the commercials had multiple themes, indicating the varied, multilayered mes- sages about animals in advertising and the different value and use categories that humans assign to different nonhuman animal species, upholding the ideology of the U.S. polit- ical economy. Finally, most of the animal portrayals were not anthropomorphized; those that were given human characteristics were typically part of a multithemed mes- sage that portrayed animals as allegories. Many of the animal images reinforced human gender and racial boundaries. This research establishes the importance of incorporating the study of nonhuman animals in sociological theory and research, particularly the animal image in popular culture and its connection to the portrayal of other outgroups, such as women and racial minorities. Animals are of substantial symbolic importance in human society. The significance of the human/animal bond has been reflected in our dance, art, and narrative for thousands of years (Shepard 1996); our language is saturated with animal terms and metaphors (Bry- ant 1979); and some suggest that our most profound human social problems are better understood in reflection on the human/animal relationship. For example, human slavery has been compared to the enslavement of animals (Spiegel 1986); a connection has been drawn between our cultural image of and attitude toward women and the slaughter of ani- mals (Adams 1990); and cruelty to animals has been found to be tied to the experience and commission of domestic violence and sexual abuse (Ascione 1993; Ressler, Burgess, Hart- man, Douglas, and McCormack 1986).

While much effort has gone into understanding the hidden assumptions and contested terrains of the symbolic meaning of these constructions, sociologists have rarely been interested in decoding animal symbolism, despite its overwhelming presence in our cultural imagina- tion (Bryant and Snizek 1993). Nor have many been interested in interrogating the ideo- logical foundations of the "human" versus "animal" dichotomy.' This research begins to fill that void. Through an exploratory content analysis of television advertisements, we examine the dominant messages broadcast about animals and the ways in which these messages might be subject to alternative readings. BACKGROUND Theoretical Background: Reading Cultural Texts Cultural products such as film, news, romance novels, or advertisements must be interro- gated within their context and their relation to the institutions and ideologies of their time (Edgerton, Marsden, and Nachbar 1997; Denzin 1992, p. 143). While the "dominant cul- tural meanings in any historical moment" (Denzin 1992, p. 137) are found in the cultural text, they contain much more than the message of the dominant ideology. The popular cul- ture images we consume are multilayered and complex. Responding to this heterogeneity, the study of cultural texts has, in recent years, shifted from content analyses of overt mes- sages to more nuanced readings that consider the various possible interpretations of a text (Zoonen 1994). In this vein, Gamson, Croteau, Hoynes, and Sasson (1992) identify two relevant types of meaning in a text: the taken-for-granted assumptions of which readers are generally unconscious and the more manifest messages that different groups may contest. Alterna- tively, Denzin (1992) argues that a text may be read in three ways: dominant/hegemonic (accepting the taken-for-granted assumptions), negotiated (incorporating contradictory interpretations into the dominant code), and oppositional (understanding the text through a completely different framework). Further, readers interpret text meanings based on lived experiences. Thus, our attitudes and actions toward a particular social object (e.g., a housewife, football player, or animal) are organized in narratives or frames constructed by the combination of our experiences and the cultural messages we have absorbed, be they contested, negotiated, consciously accepted, or taken-for-granted. This connection between life experiences and the consumption and interpretation of popular culture links the study of text meanings to symbolic interactionism. Visual records (including advertisements) give structure and meaning to our everyday lives as we interact with the text (Denzin 1989a; 1989b; 1992). For example, Denzin's (1991; 1992) concept of "interactionist cultural criticism" details the interaction between the individual's subjec- tivity and the cultural text. On the one hand, the viewers' interpretations of a text are cen- trally shaped by their subjectivities as they are formed by the individuals' positions in the hierarchies of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nationality. These varied subjectivities make possible oppositional and negotiated readings of popular culture (Denzin 1992, p. 151). In a theoretical analysis of the link between media images and the social construc- tion of reality, Gamson and his colleagues (1992) also emphasized the oppositional</page><page sequence="3">The Animal Text 567 reading of cultural texts. They argued that the discourse in the media is an open text that allows for competing constructions of reality from readers whose daily lives lead them to interpret text meanings in ways that go beyond the dominant ideology embedded in the imagery. A number of scholars have positioned their study of popular culture representations using this interactionist framework, finding oppositional or negotiated readings in a wide variety of texts. For example, research has revealed competing narratives about the environ- mental crisis in children's cartoons (King 1994) and in Seventeen magazine (Currie 1994), different interpretations of actors (Valdivia 1998) and of alcoholism (Denzin 1989; Basic 1992) in contemporary films, contested meanings in news reports about nature conserva- tion (Burgess, Harrison, and Maiteny 1991), and the multiple meanings of gene fetishism in a cartoon ad in Science magazine (Haraway 1997, p. 154). Before decoding, these texts reproduced cultural ideologies and stereotypes (i.e., in the examples above, about the envi- ronmental crisis, Rosie Perez, alcoholism, nature conservation, and technoscience). Applying a subversive reading to the visual representations provides an "alternative and/ or opposition to powerholders' staged, dominant, and ideological reality/writing" meshing symbolic interactionism with cultural studies (Musolf 1992, p. 183). Finally, oppositional and negotiated readings of the cultural representations of non- human animals has been the subject of recent theoretical work in history, the history of science, and feminist and cultural studies (e.g., Adams 1990; Haraway 1989; 1997; Baker 1993; Malamud 1998). Donna Haraway (1989) examined the social construction of sci- entific knowledge about animals (such as the stories of primates in National Geographic) as a storytelling process using contested narratives of gender, race, and science. For exam- ple, she described the gendered process of human research on primates in the field, where men followed and documented the activities of male primates and women focused their attention on female primates, and how these gendered experiences produced different read- ings of the primate story. Steve Baker (1993) also argued that the reading of animals is shaped by culture and that there are numerous and contradictory cultural representations of animals. Indeed, we use animal references in so many contexts and in so many different ways that "animals can apparently be used to mean anything and everything" (Baker 1993, p. 4). He claimed that some of the most obvious contradictory animal representations can be found in popular culture (Baker 1993, p. 167). Animals in Popular Culture Most research on the animal message in cultural texts has been conducted by literary scholars documenting the symbolic meaning of animal characters in literature. For exam- ple, Oswald (1995) found that children's fiction portrays dogs as protectors of humans against wild animals, and horses as having a special sense of danger that they also use to save humans. In a more elaborate analysis, McCrindle and Odendaal (1994, p. 137) exam- ined books in South African preschools, characterizing animal portrayals as realistic, humanized ("acted like animals, but with human traits such as human speech and thoughts"), anthropomorphic ("an animal presented in human form," such as wearing clothing), or fantasy ("e.g., mythical creatures, unicorns, monsters, and dragons"). They found that preschool children preferred books centering on anthropomorphic or fantasy animals, perhaps because they have not yet learned to draw a strict distinction between</page><page sequence="4">568 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 40/No. 4/1999 humans and animals. McCrindle and Odendaal also argued that animals are often used to teach lessons about human values (i.e., used as a socializing agent), but that this technique must be moderated by the need to provide realistic information about animal behavior and human/animal interactions. Burt (1988) argued that the animal double (the identification of a human with an ani- mal) is a common literary theme and that relationships with animals are often used to sym- bolize key passages in a child's life, such as the passage to adulthood upon an animal's death or the integration into society upon saving an animal from a bad situation. The ani- mal double has also been used in literature to portray a character's abuse of animals as the result of abuse she or he has experienced. Other researchers have documented the symbolic meaning of animals in popular cul- ture by examining the portrayal of companion animals in comic strips (Carmack 1997), animal themes in tabloids (Herzog and Galvin 1992), and animal content in network tele- vision programming (Church 1996; Paul 1996) and film (Hirschman and Sanders 1997). Carmack (1997) studied a sample of popular comic strips showing realistic interactions between humans and pets. Her analysis revealed that the comics portrayed human/pet interactions through three major themes: affection and companionship, obligatory/nec- essary aspects of interaction (training, grooming, etc.), and nuisance or stressful aspects of pet ownership (property destruction, barking, etc.). Herzog and Galvin (1992) ana- lyzed tabloid articles, pictures, and cartoons involving animals. They found nine the- matic categories that symbolize American feelings about human/animal relations: animal as loved one, animal as savior, animal as threat, animal as victim, animal as tool, animal as sex object or sexual aggressor, the imaginary animal, animal as person, and animal as object of wonder, with a miscellaneous category encompassing other themes. Hirschman and Sanders (1997) examined the portrayal of animals in ten films centered around a companion animal, usually a dog but sometimes including a cat. Treating the films' narratives as metaphors for human life as well as lessons about how we should draw boundaries between humans and animals and among animals, they found that the films addressed five themes: marking some animals as human-like and others as separate, encouraging dominant conceptions of gender roles, depicting and encouraging the forma- tion of nuclear families and having children, dogs serving as "surrogate parents and pro- tectors of children," and supporting cultural values of "equality and democracy" (p. 59). Further, the films portrayed animals in three distinct types: utility/farm animals (treated as objects rather than individuals), wild animals (portrayed either as friendly and helpful, dangerous and harmful, or as food/prey, and representing nature outside human control), and pets, who were portrayed as the most analogous to humans and as such were given voice and gendered status in the narratives. Paul (1996) studied animal content in British children's television. Fotusing on chil- dren's television as a vehicle through which, among other things, adults teach children how to understand animals, Paul examined the differential treatment accorded to pets, farm animals, and wild animals in these programs. She found that, in fictional programs, pets were more likely to be portrayed as good and as main characters, while farm animals were more likely to be portrayed as neutral, minor characters. Wild animals were more likely to be portrayed as bad characters and were less likely than pets but more likely than farm animals to be main characters. Mammals, birds, and reptiles were portrayed as more human-like and were more likely to be good characters than were fish or invertebrates. In nonfiction programming, wild and farm animals were portrayed as liked significantly less</page><page sequence="5">The Animal Text 569 often than were pets, as were mammals and birds as compared to reptiles, fish, and inverte- brates. Connected to these patterns, Paul (1996, p. 176) found that when animal suffering was portrayed, it was generally only condemned when a mammal was suffering; other- wise, the suffering "[was] presented without comment or judgment." Further, although numerous instances of meat eating were included in the shows, only the eating of elephant meat was portrayed as negative; when the production of animal products was portrayed in nonfiction programs, the production of meat and leather was conspicuously absent, in favor of products like milk and wool. Paul concludes that these images reflect two conflicting messages of our culture: that animals, at least mammals, should be protected and some- times loved and, at the same time, not all animals are equally worthy of this affection, and that eating meat is acceptable and normal. As we will see, this basic conflict is also central to the commercials we analyzed. Finally, Church (1996) reported on a study of the portrayal of animals in prime-time and Saturday morning programming on the four major television networks from 1972- 1993. The study found that animals were portrayed much more often as villains, nuisances, and threats than were humans (a portrayal that may serve to justify animal abuse). Wild ani- mals received worse treatment than other animals, particularly when they were in their own environments. The study found a substantial amount of violence by and against ani- mals. This violence was more prevalent in children's (Saturday morning) programming than in prime time. The study concluded that the animal images (and thus perhaps our atti- tudes toward animals generally) are determined largely by the animals' usefulness to us. The study also suggested that the preferred animal image presented by the media might be partially explained by the need to avoid offending corporate sponsors such as the meat industry. The link between the corporation and the profit motive in the U.S. capitalist economy and the cultural representation of animals is illustrated most clearly in commer- cial advertising. The Animal Image in Advertising Of all forms of popular culture, television commercials are particularly important sources of symbolic messages because of the pervasiveness of advertising images in our daily lives (Bretl and Cantor 1988). Feminist scholars examining the portrayal of women and sex roles have demonstrated the importance of advertising in shaping our values and behav- iors. Increased viewing of the mass media, which more often than not provide stereotyped images of women's roles and capacities, has been linked with "more sex-typed views of the world" (Bretl and Cantor 1988, p. 608). Many feminists have also linked media images, par- ticularly advertising, to low self-esteem and eating disorders among women (see, paradig- matically, Wolf 1991). These scholars posit that advertisements encourage particular values that lead to continued consumption. Thus, in the case of the enormous beauty and diet industries, the messages encourage women to feel insecure about their looks and to believe that the solution lies in beauty products and services (Wolf 1991; Torrens 1998). Although advertisers must offer messages that resonate with the values and experiences of viewers in order to be successful, commercials nonetheless represent the views and economic interests of commodity producers (Torrens 1998). Just as it affects women's body image and health, this economic imperative behind commercials has important implications for the treatment of animals. In U.S. culture, as illustrated in the ads described below, animals are important moneymakers both as pets who</page><page sequence="6">570 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 40/No. 4/1999 need food and other care and as producers of meat, clothing, and other products. Advertisers must, then, perpetuate a clear distinction between animals to be loved as family members (and lavished with pet goodies like toys and treats) and animals to be used as food or work- ers. Clearly, to which side of this divide a species falls has crucial consequences for its life chances. Further, these effects are magnified by the fact that animals are universally popu- lar advertising tools (Harbrecht 1993). Erickson (1986) argues that this popularity is due both to the popularity of pets and to our consistently demonstrated tendency to evaluate positively people who are with animals. It is surely due as well to the power of animals as symbols, either of a nation (e.g., the kangaroo for Australia or the bald eagle for the United States) or a trait (e.g., a dove as symbol of peace in the West). Two earlier studies examined the portrayal of animals in advertising. Arluke (1994) studied the meaning of laboratory animals in advertisements in two major scientific jour- nals. He found that lab animals were portrayed as classy chemicals (emphasizing the ani- mals' purity, which is necessary for good scientific data), consumer goods (with the animals crafted to meet scientists' particular needs), or team players (docile, easily handled, quiet). Some of these advertisements had gendered messages, such as a subservient-acting preg- nant mouse in a maternity dress saying, "real anxious to please you." Arluke (1994) con- cluded that both researchers and the animal breeding companies that advertise in the jour- nals shape the meanings attached to laboratory animals. Further, the ads helped the animal researchers deal with killing animals on a daily basis, which requires both separation from and connection with the animals (Arluke 1994). Magdoff and Barnett (1989) used focus groups to examine why people find animal ads appealing. They found that animals in television commercials serve two major functions for the viewers and that these functions tend to appeal differently to men and women. Some ads use animals to symbolize valued qualities, such as loyalty and strength, that the viewer wants to have; these ads were found to appeal more to men. Other ads show ani- mals involved in relationships and appreciating human attentions, such as a pet being affectionate with its owner after receiving food; these ads were found to appeal more to women.2 Finally, one crucial factor that helps determine the meaning of animals in any medium is whether or not the animal is anthropomorphized. While some scholars argue that anthro- pomorphism is a sentimental misrepresentation of animals' actual natures (Benson 1983), others see it as an extension of our ability to take the role of the other and as an important way for us to try to understand the inner world of animals (Eddy, Gallup, and Povenelli 1993; Lockwood 1989). In either case, anthropomorphism provides a complex ideological terrain in the context of the human/animal division. What does the use of anthropomor- phism mean for this division and for the distinctions we make among animals? The meanings of anthropomorphism surely depend on context. There are several inter- esting studies on how and when people use anthropomorphism. Eddy, Gallup, and Pov- enelli (1993) found that college undergraduates were more likely to anthropomorphize animals that were closer to humans on the phylogenetic scale. This pattern may be analo- gous to our tendency to be more concerned about and more positive toward people we per- ceive as similar to us, a tendency Pious (1993) called the "similarity principle." Brabant and Mooney (1989) analyzed anthropomorphic content in greeting cards and found that anthropomorphized cards were considerably more likely than nonanthropomorphized cards to be aimed at a general audience instead of a family member or friend. They con-</page><page sequence="7">The Animal Text 571 cluded that anthropomorphism allowed people to minimize their risk of rejection because the animal content made the card appear less sentimental or serious. One issue related to anthropomorphism is our tendency to project a gender onto ani- mals based on how the animals' perceived traits mesh with cultural understandings of gen- dered characteristics. This projection occurs without regard to the actual sex of the animal and is generally part of our image of the species as a whole. Lash and Polyson (1987) found that when asked to imagine an individual animal of 93 different species and say whether they perceived each as female or male, 67 of the animals had a significant gender association for the respondents. Of those gendered, 58 percent were perceived as male and only 14 percent as female. Hickrod and Schmitt (1982) examined anthropomorphism in the process by which a pet becomes a family member. They established that, after the initial entry into the family when the animal is interchangeable with other animals, the pet is named, making it an "interactional object" (p. 61) because it now has an identity and can be discussed like a person or talked to like a person. One important aspect of their work is their concept of the link between primary frames that answer the question, "What is going on?" and keyed frames that mean different things to the participants than what the primary frame indi- cates. For example, it is impossible to truly understand someone else's keyed pet unless we have participated in our own keying of a pet. They concluded that the frames people use to key nonhuman animals (e.g., having a beloved pet and doing dissections or coming to view a beloved pet as a nuisance after the birth of a child) are important for organizing human/animal activity. Research has not only documented the prominence of animals in structuring our daily lives (Hickrod and Schmitt 1982) but also the substantial role of the media in shaping atti- tudes and public policy about animals. For example, Podberscek (1994) documents that after a child died from a rottweiler dog attack in 1989, there was a sudden increase in neg- ative media coverage in British newspapers about the aggressiveness of certain dog breeds. That coverage produced a public outcry and the eventual passage of the Danger- ous Dogs Act that strictly controlled possession of certain breeds. Podberscek argued that the negative treatment of certain breeds was based in part on public perceptions that were shaped by this media coverage. This study demonstrates one way in which the media images we consume and interact with have important effects on our attitudes and behavior. Jones (1997) also notes a pattern of agenda setting by public outcry similar to that discussed by Podberscek: a surge of support for animal welfare and the first Animal Welfare Act in the U.S. came on the heels of extensive media coverage of a case of dognapping in which the dog was sold to researchers. State legislation has also been influenced by media coverage, as in the recent banning of horse tripping in several West- ern states (Jones 1997). In summary, research indicates that the animal image has a powerful presence in the popular culture, providing a wide variety of symbolic messages about nature and culture. In addition, the influence of animals in our daily lives has been well documented, as has the influence of the media's coverage of animals on public opinion and social policy. But while television advertising is one of the media's most powerful tools of persuasion and manipulation of attitudes, there is a paucity of research on how animals are portrayed in advertising, particularly television commercials. Our study begins to fill that research void. We provide an exploratory account of the meaning of animals as portrayed in net-</page><page sequence="8">572 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 40/No. 4/1999 work television commercials to understand some of "the stories that are crusted like barna- cles onto the striking advertising image" (Haraway 1997, p. 255). METHOD Sample We drew the sample of commercials from NBC. Based on a test count of commercials appearing on NBC during different parts of the day, we decided to exclude the hours of 2 A.M. to 6 A.M. because this time period contained very few commercials with animals. Using a random numbers table, we took the first four digits of the first number chosen as the starting point for the first day's taping, expressed in military time. We taped for that day for two hours from this random starting time, following the same procedure for six more days. We thus collected fourteen hours of NBC broadcasting, two hours from each day from Tuesday, June 23, 1998, through Monday, June 29, 1998. Only commercials that showed live animals were eligible for inclusion in the sample; ads with live animals were included whether the animal was the focus of the advertisement or a background element, such as birds flying by. Thus, commercials with stuffed animals or other inanimate ani- mals (e.g., a dog-shaped cookie jar) were not included in the study.3 Commercials that appeared more than once during the taped hours were only counted once in the sample. Our final sample consisted of seventy-two commercials.4 Measures For each commercial we recorded the time of day of broadcast, the type of program (talk show, soap opera, news, etc.) during which the ad occurred, the product or service being advertised, and the animal species shown in the commercial. To examine the extent of anthropomorphism in the commercials, we used Brabant and Mooney's (1989) criteria for anthropomorphism. This definition considers an animal anthropomorphized if it has any of the following four characteristics: "1) ability to communicate, for example, it spoke or read; 2) emotion, for example, it smiled or cried; 3) appearance, for example, it wore clothing or carried paraphernalia associated with humans; or 4) action, for example, it did something only humans do, such as play golf or drive a car" (Brabant and Mooney 1989, p. 481). We also coded whether or not different species or mixed types of the same species appeared together in a commercial. To code the themes through which commercials portrayed animals, we began with Herzog and Galvin's (1992) tabloid themes. We expected that some of the themes (such as the ani- mal as sexual object or as aggressor) would probably not appear on TV ads, and we also expected that some themes we would find in advertising would not have been present in tabloids and would therefore require new concepts to describe them. Both of these expec- tations turned out to be correct. Coding the commercials with mutually exclusive themes produced six themes, a miscellaneous category, and a multi-themed category. First, animal as loved one described commercials that showed scenes of affectionate interactions with animals (e.g., petting a dog or cat) or of animals involved in people's everyday lives, such as a pet riding in a car with family, a fish tank in a girl's bedroom, or a dog being walked. Second, animal as symbol included animals used in company logos (Food Lion, the MGM lion, Red Lobster, etc.) and animals used to symbolize some quality</page><page sequence="9">The Animal Text 573 or idea, such as birds to connote height or a turtle for slowness. Third, we considered ads showing animals bothering humans in some (always minor) way, such as insect bites or animals in the garden, as animal as nuisance. Fourth, animal in nature included any scenes of animals as part of nature, such as birds flying over a beach, a fish swimming in a river, or a deer running through a forest. Fifth, animal as tool included animals being used for food, recreation, transportation, or as beasts of burden (as in ads showing Dis- ney's new animal theme park), soldiers riding horses, a man using sled dogs, or a cow as a source of milk. Sixth, animal as allegory, a concept borrowed from Lockwood (1989), included commercials in which the animal filled the roles of humans (e.g., rabbits ordering salad dressing). We placed commercials that did not fit any of these themes in a miscella- neous category, and we analyzed those involving multiple themes separately. RESULTS: DESCRIPTION OF ANIMAL ADS Variety of Species and Products A considerable variety of animal species appeared in the ads in our sample, paralleling the variety Herzog and Galvin (1992) found in their study of tabloids. Dogs and birds were the most popular, appearing 20 and 12 times, respectively. Other animals appearing more than once were horses (8), cows and bulls (7), fish (5), domestic cats (4), lions (4), bugs (3), and elephants, kangaroos, lobsters, mice, rabbits, seals, and rams (each twice). Eigh- teen other species appeared once each. Complementing this variety of species, animals were used to advertise a wide array of products and services. Twenty-two percent of the ads were for food and drink (including diverse products such as cheese, chewing gum, barbecue sauce, coffee, and tomato sauce but, surprisingly, no beer), 12.5 percent of the ads were for automobiles, and 8 percent were for medicines. Unexpectedly, pet food ads were only 2.8 percent of the sample, the same percentage as ads for technology firms and grocery stores and less than the number of ads for investment, insurance, tourism, household products (e.g., window cleaner and wood sealant), or toiletries such as toothpaste. Beyond these cases, there were eighteen other products that appeared in only one ad each, including cellular phone service, dia- pers, venetian blinds, a kid's club, refrigerators, adhesive bandages, and the 2002 Olym- pics. Animals appeared in ads during all types of television shows found in the sample. They appeared most often during talk shows (39 percent of the ads), followed by news programs (28 percent), sporting events (14 percent), and sitcoms and daytime dramas (10 percent each). Primary Themes The most frequently occurring theme in the seventy-two commercials was animal as loved one (26 percent). Most typically, these ads showed animals, usually a dog or cat but some- times other animals, such as a turtle, participating in family life-sleeping with, playing with, being fed by, following, sitting with, or standing by a family member or generally interacting in the group. For example, in a mustard commercial a dog poses with its family in a picnic photograph, holding a hot dog in its mouth. In an animated cat food commercial, two cats plot to wake up their owner so she will feed them breakfast, and</page><page sequence="10">574 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 40/No. 4/1999 the owner then feeds and pets them. In a car commercial, two kids play with the family dog in the backseat. Eighteen percent of the commercials fell into the animal as symbol category. Some of these commercials showed animals representing the company's name or product (e.g., the kangaroo on Aussie Shampoo's logo, the ram on the Dodge logo, the jaguar for Jaguar cars, or the Hartford buck). These animals are generally chosen for the logo because they have some cultural meaning attached to them that the advertisers want to attach to their product, such as a buck's strength or a jaguar's speed (Harbrecht 1993). Some com- mercials used animals to symbolize particular traits without putting the animals in a logo. In an outdoor window cleaner ad, a man looks up reluctantly at his second-story windows and the house grows several stories, with birds flying around the top stories to underline how tall the house is (and hence how hard it seems to clean the top win- dows). In an insurance ad, scavenger birds appear in a burglarized home, dramatizing the disruption and totality of the invasion. Animal as tool was the third largest theme we found in the ads, comprising 13.9 percent of the sample. Typical of this category were a refrigerator commercial showing an Eskimo using sled dogs and a tourism ad showing horseback riding. There were some more imag- inative ads in this category as well, such as a car ad in which a man has an elephant spray water from its trunk to clean a car and one in which a man shows his love for cheese by "going on a date" with and kissing a cow. One less sanguine ad showed a mother and chil- dren in a dirty medieval market, surrounded by live and already-slaughtered animals; the family is then transported into the sanitary modem supermarket made possible by plastics. The fourth largest category of single-themed ads was animal in nature (11 percent), which included scenes of birds flying over a beach or sitting in a tree, a wolf howling in a canyon, a lizard sunning itself on a rock, and a fish swimming in a river. Animal as allegory was the fifth largest theme, making up 8 percent of the sample. These were among the most interesting and humorous ads in the sample. To demonstrate the quality of its salad dressing, one ad showed two rabbits receiving a truckload of the dressing, including one rabbit signing the invoice with a paw print. To illustrate that its chocolate syrup is fat free, another ad showed a very thin animated cow sauntering down a fashion-show runway. A computer company portrayed its problem-solving abilities by showing a mouse who, spying the cheese at the end of a maze, puts on sunglasses, lights a match, and burns down the maze. In an ad for roasted nuts, a beaver, in a desperate attempt to convince some confused campers that it wants their nuts, quickly carves Mr. Peanut out of a nearby log. The smallest single-theme category was animal as nuisance (6.9 percent), which showed bugs (both bothering humans outdoors and living in people's homes), a ground- hog disturbing a suburban lawn, and house pets causing allergy attacks. The miscella- neous category included three ads, two of which match themes presented by Herzog and Galvin (1992). In a theme park ad, a person in a dragon suit hugs a child and birds fly in the background; this ad includes Herzog and Galvin's imaginary animal theme as well as our animal in nature theme. In a steel industry ad, a shark menaces a man in an under- water cage; this ad matches Herzog and Galvin's animal as threat theme. Finally, a chewing gum ad shows pigeons in a city. While the pigeons are exhibiting normal behavior, they do not quite fit into the animal in nature theme because they are in a human-made environment.</page><page sequence="11">The Animal Text 575 Multiple Portrayal Themes The multiple themes category comprised 11 percent of the sample. In some of these ads, one animal fills more than one role, while in others, different animals represent the differ- ent themes involved. Two commercials provide clear examples of the former type of ad. In a car ad, a turtle walks across the floor to show how slow the competitor's cars are (animal as symbol). Then a young boy picks it up, and the turtle becomes a pet who is held in the family picture and sits on the boy's lap in the new car (animal as loved one). A dog plays two roles in a chewing gum ad, first standing alone, responding to the narrator's statements by cocking its head at "Why?" and "Great news!" (animal as allegory), and then riding in a convertible with a young couple on a road trip (animal as loved one). The multi-themed commercials often portrayed the different values and uses associated with different species. For example, in a detergent ad, a woman lists the various things she must do each day besides the laundry: "prevent osteoporosis" (the woman sits on a cow's back, balancing a glass of milk on her head, while a scientist in a white lab coat holds the cow's harness); "train dog" (a dog balances part of a toy train track on its head and wears a blue ribbon won in competition); and "control frizz" (the woman has unruly hair in which a bird is nesting). In this ad, we learn that cows are to be treated as tools-they are there to produce milk for our health, with the presence of the scientist suggesting the rightness and necessity of this use. The dog, on the other hand, while its use in competition is a human recreation that makes it a tool, is also clearly a loved one, a domestic pet. Finally, the bird is a kind of animal that we basically leave alone in nature, neither domesticating it nor using it for our own purposes. A similar example of these divisions comes from an ad for barbecue sauce. A man bar- becuing meat on his back porch offers a monologue about cowboys and the great outdoors, and we see an owl hoot in a dark tree. Then we see a poodle with a bandanna tied around its neck sitting on the porch with the man, looking at him and whining in response to the man's words. The sauce label then comes to life, with animated cowboys riding horses to chase down a snorting bull. Again in this commercial, we are presented with a basic divi- sion of animals: the bull (which will be food) and the horses are tools for human use; the dog is a loved one, a pet that may be talked to and dressed up; and the owl is left alone in nature, symbolizing the lonely nights of a cowboy in the wilderness. Commercials with animal as allegory as one of the multiple themes provide interesting cases through which to examine attitudes toward different species. The animal chosen to serve as an allegory reflects its symbolic cultural meaning, including its relationship to humans and other animals. In other words, just as the use of anthropomorphism varies by our feelings toward a species, so does our use of a species in an allegory to human behavior. Thus, in a theme park ad, a man plans an "outback area" of the park and consid- ers kangaroo races and crocodile wrestling, both animals illustrating the animal as tool theme since they are being used for recreation. Next, however, the kangaroo is shown work- ing with the narrator (the narrator speaks, and the kangaroo makes faces and points) to show the man how the park should be. Similarly, in an ad for tourism, the main character is Ducky (a person in a duck suit with baseball jersey and cap, on vacation from the theme park where he works); his vacation includes horseback riding and lobster fishing (both cases of animal as tool). In both of these ads, the choice of an animal as allegorical is likely based on the fact that in the U.S. system of animal classification, kangaroos are more human-like than crocodiles, as are ducks more so than lobsters.</page><page sequence="12">576 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 40/No. 4/1999 Anthropomorphized Portrayals Of the seventy-two commercials, 19 percent contained anthropomorphized animals. Some examples of anthropomorphism captured in our sample were animated cats discussing how to wake up their owner for breakfast, Minnie Mouse and Bugs Bunny, animated insects living in the wall of a house and discussing the humans' activities, and a duck (por- trayed by a person in a duck suit) going on vacation. Almost half (42 percent) of the anthropomorphized animals were used as allegories, and four of the eight multi-themed ads included anthropomorphic portrayals. While most themes included both anthropomor- phic and nonanthropomorphic ads, there were clear tendencies within each theme. Ninety percent of the animal as tool ads were nonanthropomorphic, as were 80 percent of the animal as nuisance ads and 95 percent of the animal as loved one ads. None of the animals in nature or the animals as symbol ads were anthropomorphized. This finding is logical since an ani- mal is used as a symbol or placed in nature precisely because, as an animal, it carries some particular cultural meaning-voices or other anthropomorphic symbols are not needed to convey the message. Four of the anthropomorphized animals (a rabbit, a dog, a duck, and a cat) were portrayed as male, two (a mouse and a cow) as female, and eight were not gen- dered (as signaled by voice, clothing, or name). DISCUSSION: READING ANIMAL ADS Reading the animal text in television advertisements revealed a variety of cultural repre- sentations of animals. Animals were portrayed as beloved family members, symbols of dis- ruption, useful workers, allegories, or bothersome. Sometimes animals were shown in their natural environment-flying, swimming, or howling in a canyon. Many of the ads had mul- tiple animal themes, such as using a dog for recreation and as a family member, illustrat- ing the different values and uses humans attach to different nonhuman animal species. A critical reading of the animal text uncovered deeper meanings that the ads convey about animals. First, the animal as loved one ads present as natural the idea that animals can and should be domesticated and that particular species should be used in this regard, especially dogs. The ads suggest that these animals should be made central to human lives; thus, the dog should be brought to picnics and on road trips, the pet turtle should be brought to the car dealership, and the owner should get up and feed the hungry cats rather than, say, locking them out of the bedroom and going back to sleep. Further, the ads present a particularly rosy and uncomplicated image of what this animal/human relation- ship will be like. The ads portray owners joyously frolicking with their pets, enjoying even such mundane activities as feeding them breakfast. This one-sided portrayal is in contrast to the portrayal of pets in comic strips (Carmack 1997), that includes the annoying aspects of pet ownership along with the pleasurable ones. The advertising purpose of such a positive image of pets may be to encourage the increased consumption of pet animals as a commod- ity, just as the idea of indulging pets may lead to increased purchases of pet treats and other products. The consequence of this idealized view, however, is rampant pet abandonment and neglect by owners who tire of caring for their animals (Palmer 1978; Arluke 1991). Some of the meanings attached to particular animals in these ads were based in what is "known" or the SF (scientific fact/science fiction) (Haraway 1989) about the nature of ani- mals, such as using the image of a jaguar to represent speed. But these images frequently involved the imposition of a particular morality on the imagined behavior of a species.</page><page sequence="13">The Animal Text 577 These judgments are often on shaky empirical ground as well as a questionable applica- tion of human moral principles. Most importantly, these irrelevant moral judgments can have important material consequences for the animals involved. For example, Glickman (1995) documents the fact that hyenas have a bad image in U.S. popular culture as scaven- gers, while their actual behavior is quite different from the myths. As we have seen with the case of the Dangerous Dogs Act in England (Podberscek 1994), which targeted breeds not even involved in the attack cases at hand, media images of the nature of a particular animal clearly affect how we interact with it. Thus, whereas producers encode these adver- tisements with standard cultural associations between particular species and certain moral or physical traits, these associations are neither natural nor harmless. The animals as tool advertisements, showing dogs or horses used to transport humans and various animals used for food, conveyed the overt message that it is acceptable and normal to consume animals or use them for labor. The ads go further, however, to suggest that only particular animals may be used in this way, reinforcing the standard Western divisions between pet and farm animals. By portraying animal use in a matter-of-fact manner, the ads also teach us that we should not feel any discomfort about our animal con- sumption. Finally, and likely to facilitate this lack of discomfort, the ads distance us from the animals we will consume, maintaining the idea that we should not experience connec- tions with these animals. This ideology of distance is subverted by the cultural practices of Orthodox Jewish "humane" killing rituals and by lab workers' naming of experimental animals (Hirschman and Sanders 1997), but the theme still dominates advertisements. One of the major ways that the ads achieve this distance is by avoiding anthropomor- phism in the animal as tool themed commercials. The absence of anthropomorphism in this theme is logical since humanizing the animal would make it more difficult to see it as a tool for consumption or recreation. As Hirschman and Sanders (1997, p. 61) put it, our ability to use animals in these ways "is premised upon the emotional distancing of our- selves from them," defining them as other (see also Arluke 1994). Paul's (1996) study of animals in British children's television confirms this apparent need for distancing, finding that both pets and wild animals were more likely to be portrayed as good or bad, respectively, whereas farm animals were more likely to be portrayed as neutral, minor characters, a portrayal that minimizes the children's investment in such animals as they watch the programs. There is some complexity, however, in the nature of the distancing in the ads. We can see anthropomorphic variation in the animal as tool theme according to how much the animal will be harmed by its use. For example, a lobster picked up on a fishing boat and the animals slaughtered for meat in the medieval market are background elements of the ads, encoded as part of the natural order of things. The cheese ad, on the other hand, in which an elderly man "dates" a cow, comes closest to anthropomorphizing the animal, probably because American common sense says that cows' perpetual lactation to produce our milk and cheese does not hurt them. Hence the cow can be a central character and object of affection in the ad, even if not anthropomorphized. The one ad in the animal as tool cate- gory that involved an anthropomorphized animal confirms this logic. The ad, for Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park, involves a use of animals that most people consider rela- tively benign: although they will be in captivity, the animals will live in open, naturalistic settings. Nonetheless, the theme park is appealing because it provides a chance to see ani- mals, so the only anthropomorphism involved is of Minnie Mouse, appearing in her dress and white gloves. The animals at the park, anthropomorphized or not, can be made central</page><page sequence="14">578 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 40/No. 4/1999 to the ad, pictured in close-ups and allowed to look directly at the camera, because their use produces little or no dissonance for most viewers. Animals are shown in nature precisely to portray their difference from humans and crowded urban life or, as Hirschman and Sanders (1997, p. 62) put it, as "the embodiment of Nature ... set in opposition to human Culture." For example, a man escaping into nature in his new Jeep encounters a wolf and emulates its howling. Similarly, in several ads set on a beach, birds are shown flying in the background; birds appear as part of the American image of an attractive beach. Thus, these ads locate another position for animals-not to be consumed directly or domesticated but to be left "wild" and then consumed as part of a retreat from culture, as in a trip to the beach or driving one's Jeep to a remote canyon. Animals as allegories were often anthropomorphized to mimic or demonstrate human behaviors. These animals were all mammals (rabbits, dogs, cows, mice), phylogenetically closer to humans than crocodiles or lobsters. Hirschman and Sanders (1997) argue that the messages purveyed in such allegorical portrayals may be read as less threatening (i.e., viewers would absorb the message of the text less critically) than if the text employed humans. Brabant and Mooney's (1989) finding that greeting cards using animal content involve less social risk implies a similar conclusion: using animals to convey a message is coded as less serious and is therefore consumed in a less thoughtful or critical manner. If this is the case, allegorical portrayals of animals may, even more than other types of ads, encourage viewers to engage the preferred meaning of the text. While bothersome animals are often portrayed simply as pests to be eliminated (e.g., ads with a person waving away or slapping bugs), they are also often portrayed anthropo- morphically, generally presenting the animals as plotting against humans. The idea that animals plot to bother or harm humans functions to encourage people to take action against animals, minimizing any possible guilt feelings about killing the "pests." In this sample, an ad for extermination services shows an animated bug colony behind the walls of a suburban home, in which the bugs monitor the humans' behavior and laugh when they hear that an exterminator has been called (because they assume the service would never come). Once the exterminator arrives, we see the bugs running out of the home with suit- cases and other belongings, an image that makes the message-this company will kill the bugs-more palatable by helping us to imagine that the bugs will not be hurt at all but will just leave the premises. This guilt-assuaging mechanism may reflect an ambivalence about our callous treat- ment of some animals. The portrayal of "pests" as purposefully bothering humans may serve not to assuage guilt but as a narrative affirmation of the dominant belief that exter- mination is unquestionably acceptable, or perhaps as humor resting on this assumption. The anthropomorphizing of these animals seemingly contradicts Hirschman and Sanders's (1997) argument that we avoid humanizing animals we use or abuse. It may be, however, that the extremely low value our culture places on bugs means that even an anthropomor- phic portrayal does not endanger the dominant understanding that human preferences come before those of bugs. Our findings are consistent with Arluke and Sanders's (1996) argument that humans rank animals not on the basis of biological distinctions but on a sociozoologic system, or how well they seem to "fit in" and play their expected roles in society. On the sociozoo- logic scale, "good" animals, such as family pets or animals that are useful as tools, accept their subordinate place in society; they are "visibly brought into contact with the human world-of course, on human terms... [and] by their very behavior, help define and rein-</page><page sequence="15">The Animal Text 579 force the meaning of mainstream society, and are valued for this contribution" (Arluke and Sanders 1996, p. 169). "Bad" animals (vermin or demons in the form of dangerous, aggressive dogs) have an unclear subordinate status and do not remain distanced from the human world. They may be killed because they are perceived as threats to social order. Arluke and Sanders note that these social constructions are in fact moral constructions and that the construct of the good animal implies its opposite, the bad animal. These opposi- tions are influential, taken-for-granted constructs that also justify our treatment of other humans (e.g., the demonization of African Americans and of women) and serve as instru- ments through which we express our "conflicted feelings toward fellow humans" (Arluke and Sanders 1996, p. 186).5 We found few images of bad animals, supporting Baker's (1993, p. 169) argument that advertising does not use bad animal images-the dogs in commercials are always puppies or sheepdogs, "never rottweilers or American pit bull terriers."6 Animals shown in multiple roles were more likely to be complex, suggesting how dif- ferent species are valued and used differently and how the same species is used to symbol- ize different things. The sizable presence of these more complicated ads is not surprising when we remember that popular culture always includes varied and multi-layered mes- sages surrounding any image. Thus, just as the single themes identified above offer conflicting and various images of animals, some commercials combine multiple images in one advertisement, complicating the animal image presented. Confirming their com- plexity, exactly half of the multi-themed ads involved anthropomorphism. In some of these ads, one animal fills more than one role, while in others, different animals present the different themes involved, which may begin to give us a way to move beyond the category "animal" to consider how different species are portrayed and valued differently in popular culture. Thus, the place of animals in our cultural value system is complex and contradictory. We both love them as family members and use them for food or work without thinking twice; we use them as symbols and allegories of the human social world as well as mark- ing them as other. This construction of nature as opposite to culture invokes Arluke and Sanders's (1996) argument (discussed above) that each construct must have its opposite to give it meaning. Haraway (1989, p. 146) addresses the duality of nature and culture in her analysis of the social construction of nature. She describes the "traffic between nature and culture" using the story of Koko, the humanized gorilla, who was "placed in culture" by keeping and naming a pet. The complexity of our ideas about animals as expressed in television commercials is supported by extensive attitudinal research conducted by Kellert (1980; 1996). He found that the U.S. public showed strong support for four views of animals: humanistic, moralis- tic, utilitarian, and negativistic. These attitudes involve, respectively, love for individual animals such as pets, concern that animals be treated properly and not exploited or abused, interest mainly in the "practical and material value of animals," and "actively avoiding" animals due to "fear or dislike" (Kellert 1980, p. 89). Some of these attitudes can be found in the themes we have identified in animals' por- trayal on television commercials. Humanistic attitudes, the most prevalent type, are clearly the attitudes being reflected and tapped in animal as loved one ads. Moralistic attitudes were not in evidence in the ads in our sample, although they can be found. For example, an Aussie Shampoo commercial narrator states that the product is not tested on animals, and a koala shakes its head in agreement. Utilitarian attitudes, which involve a willingness to</page><page sequence="16">580 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 40/No. 4/1999 use animals for human gain and pleasure, underlie the animal as tool theme, in which ani- mals are unproblematically presented as objects for human use or, in a negative sense, in the willingness to eliminate bothersome animals in the animal as nuisance ads. Not sur- prisingly, none of the ads suggested or evoked a negativistic attitude toward animals. While some of the ads portrayed animals as a temporary nuisance, none extended this dis- like to all animals. Using an animal in a commercial inherently aims that ad at an audience that excludes people who find animals unappealing. The connection between the variety of themes we found in television commercials and the public attitudes Kellert (1980; 1996) found points to some basic aspects of the Western understanding of the human/animal relationship. For example, the prevalence of both the animal as loved one (humanistic) and the animal as tool (utilitarian) messages appears at first to be contradictory, but this dis- crepancy is part of our most basic cultural definitions and is consistent with the "good animal" sociozoologic scale discussed above (Arluke and Sanders 1996). Thus, besides constructing a morally relevant distinction between "humans" and "ani- mals" (Shapiro 1990), we also act according to a belief in differences among animals. Recall the detergent ad discussed previously. The belief that it makes sense to divide ani- mals so that a dog is a pet, a cow useful, and a bird "wild" is a set of cultural meanings taken-for-granted in the commercial, which might be nonsensical or offensive to the viewer if, for example, the cow was to be trained and the dog used as food. These mean- ings vary by time, place, and group, but the divisions in the ad are presented as natural, not as historically and geographically contingent (Paul 1996, pp. 178-179). Thus, the class into which we place a species determines the treatment an individual animal will receive: whether it will be, for example, domesticated as a pet, slaughtered for food or other items for human consumption, used to perform work for humans, used as a research subject, put into a cage for public viewing, or perhaps just left alone. The classifications we place upon the community of life are therefore of significant conse- quence for the lives of nonhuman animals. The classifications are also unlikely to change. Meanings on any level, but particularly those accepted unconsciously as "reality" or "nat- ural," serve as constraints, or "horizons of experience," within which people interpret their lives and interact with others (Denzin 1992, p. 28). As our sample of commercials demon- strates, these divisions, partly portrayed through the juxtaposition of idealized love for pets, distance from animals we will unproblematically consume, nuisances we will get rid of, and romanticized images of the wild, are significantly entrenched and naturalized in at least this area of popular culture. It is important to ask in this context what is at stake in the maintenance of these atti- tudes-what resistance might there be if these attitudes were challenged on a large scale? The humanistic and utilitarian attitudes support large, entrenched chunks of the U.S. econ- omy: the pet industry and our consumption of meat and other animal products (dairy prod- ucts, leather and fur, and the like). The maintenance of both types of attitudes therefore supports some of the major moneymaking interests in U.S. society. As Church (1996) reports, the need to avoid offending corporate sponsors, such as the meat industry, affects how animals are portrayed in television shows. It certainly follows that the commercials produced by the corporations themselves would also present images that failed to chal- lenge the relatively unconscious divisions that support showering affection and money on some animals while killing and consuming others. Because of the considerable array of products (e.g., adhesives) that use animal materials, this need to perpetuate our willingness to view animals as tools implicates many more industries that one might suppose at first</page><page sequence="17">The Animal Text 581 glance. The dominance of animal as loved one images, on the other hand, has a less direct connection to the profits of most companies. The prevalence of this theme is likely explained by companies' desire to cash in on people's humanistic attitudes by using ani- mals in their ads and thereby associating animals with their products. As demonstrated by the prominence of these two themes and their connection to two common public attitudes toward animals, the conflicting attitudes of love for individual animals and use of animals for human consumption are dominant in late twentieth-century America. Both serve as taken-for-granted assumptions that underlie a variety of popular culture texts. Challenges from the animal rights movement have succeeded in making cer- tain uses of animals contested (e.g., animal research is now more closely questioned, and some varieties, such as the infamous testing of cosmetics on rabbits' eyes, are now over- whelmingly rejected). The dominance of the basic divisions among species and the corre- spondingly appropriate uses for each, however, has not been shaken. In fact, these divisions allow the two contradictory attitudes of animal as loved one and animal as tool to exist harmoniously in most people's minds.7 The dominance of these attitudes is assisted by the nature of modern life, in which most people live in urban or suburban settings with little or no contact with animals besides domesticated, docile pets. This lack of experience makes it easy to accept the ideas about animals presented in commercials or other cultural narratives. For example, the lack of experience with live animals makes it easy to accept eating meat. We experience meat and other animal products as distinctly separate from the animals that produced them because we use different terms for the live animal and the food it becomes and because we do not encounter the animal until it is a sanitarily cellophaned package at a gleaming white super- market (Herzog and McGee 1983; Plous 1993). In other words, to return to Denzin's inter- actionist cultural criticism approach, experiences with animals that might lead to an alternative subjectivity and corresponding negotiated or oppositional readings of cultural texts seem to be rare. As a result, the ideological bases for our human/animal distinction and our categorization of animals may be our least-questioned social hierarchy. Beyond the already crucial implications of these distinctions, however, lies another important set of meanings in the animal ads and in animal texts more generally. As we have discussed briefly, animal narratives, whether in children's books, film, or even televi- sion commercials, serve as models for proper human behavior (Hirschman and Sanders 1997; McCrindle and Odendaal 1994). Haraway's (1997) reading of an American Medical News advertisement illustrates the good mlodel message. The ad's headline reads, "If you've made an unholy HMO alliance, perhaps we can help," and it shows a white male physician in his lab coat and stethoscope putting a ring on the finger of a black gorilla bride dressed in a white wedding dress. The dominant message is of course that both inter- species and interracial unions are improper and unholy. Haraway (1997, pp. 258-259) reminds us that an "unholy alliance is 'miscegenation,' the bloodsucking monster at the heart of racist and misogynistic terror. . . . It shouldn't still be possible to publish such an image in a scientific medical magazine .... But it is possible." There is more evidence that animal portrayals perpetuate racial barriers. Brabant and Mooney (1989) found that the content of the greeting cards appears to support the mainte- nance of racial boundaries by showing a mix of species or types only when the animals are in a public setting. When in private settings, animals were of the same species and body type. Brabant and Mooney (1989, p. 492) concluded that anthropomorphism is acceptable</page><page sequence="18">582 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 40/No. 4/1999 "only within specific culturally defined limitations ... [reinforcing] a cultural prohibition against inter-group interaction."8 We also found that anthropomorphized animals were more likely to be gendered than were nonanthropomorphized animals. This finding confirms the insight of feminist schol- ars that gender is one of the most fundamental organizing principles of human cultures. When we assign human traits to animals, we are much more likely to attach gendered signs to it-because if it is human, it must have and display gender. Further, when gen- dered signs were attached to an animal, the animal was twice as likely to be portrayed as male than female. Hirschman and Sanders (1997) similarly found that dogs, the central and heroic characters in the films they examined, were always portrayed as males. These findings support another feminist insight: the male is considered the norm. When a gender is unclear or unassigned, Western culture assumes the male (Tavris 1992). It appears from this data that this principle, not surprisingly, applies to anthropomorphized animals as well as to humans.9 The human construction of gender onto nonhuman animals certainly con- tributes to maintaining the salience of gendered distinctions in human social life. This effect is particularly strong when the texts involve longer narratives and can therefore use animals to portray not just gendered signs but also gendered character traits and behaviors (see Hirschman and Sanders 1997 for examples of such use). There is much more work to be done to flesh out the picture sketched here. One partic- ularly interesting avenue to pursue would be to examine animal content in television ads over time. Because dominant attitudes are always being contested and changing, viewing content over time would likely be fruitful, particularly to consider content before and after the advent of the most recent wave of animal rights activism. Taking the lead of Magdoff and Barnett (1989), future research should also document how an audience interacts with and interpret animal ads, considering how different groups (e.g., men and women or hunt- ers and nonhunters) accept, negotiate, or oppose the messages about animals offered by corporations. As Valdivia (1998) notes, we know very little about when people will engage in negotiation or opposition to a text rather than follow the dominant, or preferred, reading that the text suggests. Further examination of the connections between the por- trayal of animals in various media and the portrayal of other outgroups, such as women and raciallethnic minorities, would likely produce insights into how we might use animals to symbolize our ambivalent feelings toward other humans (Arluke and Sanders 1996). Further research might also explore the possibility that popular culture portrays animals as decorative objects, similar to its portrayal of women in music television (Baxter, DeRiemer, Landini, and Singletary 1985), or as tokens, similar to the portrayal of blacks in contempo- rary cartoons (Thibodeau 1989). Finally, perhaps the medium makes a difference in the mes- sage conveyed about animals. Baker (1993, p. 175) argued that when the animal is shown in a visual text the image is stereotypical, producing a "stupid and trivial" message that is not usually present in a narrative text about animals. We lament the tradition of largely ignoring nonhuman animals in social theory and research. Arluke and Sanders (1996, p. 57) address the need for sociological analysis of animals in Western society and argue that the world is "composed of subjects-in-interaction, human and nonhuman actors cooperating and struggling with the historical, political, and cultural forces that embed their action." We join Haraway (1997, p. 8) in "insist[ing] that social relationships include nonhumans as well as humans as socially .. active partners." One critical aspect of this social relationship is the interaction between the nonhuman animal text and its human readers.</page><page sequence="19">The Animal Text 583 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was conducted with the support of the College of Arts and Sciences at George Mason University. The data were collected during Jennifer Lerner's summer break between her junior and senior years at the University of Virginia as part of a larger project at George Mason University on animals in society. NOTES 1. For simplicity, we will use the standard "humans" and "animals" for most of the article. Although we would all do better to raise our awareness by using more accurate terms (such as human animals and nonhuman animals), the awkwardness of such terms and the lack of convenient alternatives has led us to stick with the ideologically charged humans/animals division. 2. Unfortunately, the article provided little detail about the study's methodology, and as a result, the findings should be interpreted with caution. 3. Including such animal portrayals in further study would provide an interesting basis for com- parison or for enriching our conception of the roles of animals in our cultural consciousness. As McCrindle and Odendaal (1994) point out, what we learn about animals through the medium of stuffed animals and other inanimate objects does affect our understanding of and interaction with live animals. 4. We use the terms television commercials and television advertisements interchangeably. 5. On the other hand, Baker (1993) is doubtful that animal imagery is a "natural resource" that says anything about being human. 6. See our discussion of the Dangerous Dogs Act and the shaping of the public imagination about the rottweiler dog (Podberscek 1994). 7. Paul (1996, pp. 169, 179) argues, in contrast, that we actually have some ambivalence or dis- comfort with this contradiction and that, although cultural messages teach us to divide animals into categories based on the emotions we are supposed to feel for them, we nonetheless are aware of the inconsistency at work. She argues that children's programs' avoidance of clear treatment of where meat comes from (which, incidentally, may explain children's lack of knowledge of these facts) reflects adults' discomfort with the topic. But whether we feel comfortable with this contradiction or not, the divisions remain powerful. 8. In interesting contrast, Hirschman and Sanders (1997) found that companion animal films involved "cross-species surrogacy" and other cooperative behaviors that encouraged raciallethnic harmony. Their finding that the heroic animals in the films were mixed breeds rather than purebreds, while they interpreted it through the lens of gender ideology, might also suggest a greater acceptance of racial mixing than suggested by either Brabant and Mooney (1989) or Haraway (1997). Unfortu- nately, we were not able to evaluate this issue with our limited sample of television commercials. Further research, however, should examine this discrepancy as well as further specifying the ways in which animal images interact with human systems of hierarchy. 9. Interestingly, only one-third of the genders assigned to animals in these ads correspond to those found in Lash and Polyson's (1987) research. Cows were imagined as females and dogs as males in both our sample and in Lash and Polyson's. Lash and Polyson, however, found that cats were considered females (rather than males as in our study) and found no significant gender assign- ment for mice or ducks, portrayed as females and males, respectively, in our ads. (Lash and Polyson did not include rabbits in their study, so we cannot assess the consistency of gender association for that species.) Further research is clearly needed to determine more conclusively which species have a cultural gender association and whether this association varies by reader or by context.</page><page sequence="20">584 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 40/No. 4/1999 REFERENCES Adams, Carol J. 1990.
