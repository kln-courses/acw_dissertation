INTRODUCTION The Current Research column is intended to keep readers abreast of the most important research developments in American archaeology. We no longer cover the Old World because there are now so many investigators and so much research that we cannot provide adequate coverage in the available space. For the same reason we have dropped our coverage of historical archaeology unless it deals directly with Indian populations. We are trying to make the American coverage both more readable and more informative. The emphasis has shifted from "who" and "what" to research results and their significance. We would like each of the regional columns to encapsulate significant new research, giving due credit both to the funding agencies and to the participating investigators. We cannot list every crew member, although we do try to honor requests that specific individuals be mentioned. Many of the Area Editors are able to introduce their column with a brief essay that highlights the new work and places it in the perspective of previous knowledge. Sometimes significant new publications will be indicated for the nonspecialist reader who wants to broaden his knowledge of that region. Reporters can help by feeding this kind of information to the Area Editor in a cover letter. The success of this new approach varies from region to region, based largely upon the quality of information provided to the Area Editor. Unfortunately a few researchers still view Current Research as a place to ramble on about what they did last summer. Sometimes the results and significance of the work are not clearly indicated. Therefore, in providing a concise summary the Area Editor may have to guess at what the reporter intended to say. More often, the significance of the work simply will be omitted, thereby reducing the value of the report. The next time you make a report, review Current Research in the last several issues. Some of the columns are clearly better than others. They provide both more information about recent research and a clearer statement of its significance. How do you rate the report upon your own work? The primary responsibility for upgrading the coverage of each region lies with the in- dividual researcher. If your report is concise and well written, the Area Editor may use it exactly as it stands. Too frequently, extensive editorial changes are necessary. Occasionally the Area Editor will give up in frustration, make a few editorial improvements and let it reflect upon the in- vestigator. Readers may lament that the coverage of particular regional columns is not complete. We know. We are doing our best to improve. Each of the Area Editors has a long mailing list to solicit 510</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH information. Many people on the mailing list fail to report. Still, we are missing some people. If we are missing you, please write the appropriate Area Editor to report and to get on the mailing list. Ordinarily, there is a 6-month lead time between the Area Editor's call for reports and the ap- pearance of the report in the journal. Thomas P. Myers MESOAMERICA Although settlement patterns and exchange con- tinue to represent research foci in Mesoamerica, it is worthwhile to ask what other elements characterize archaeological work in the area. These orientations do not typify most field projects, and a considerable number appear to have more broadly defined goals. In fact, general description of the culture history of areas or sites provides a major rationale for many projects. There are both long-standing and more re- cent reasons that contribute to current efforts to describe cultural characteristics in a time-space framework. Cultural-historical research is in part a function of the intellectual history of archaeology, in part a response to the need for organization of basic information in little studied regions, and in part, I suspect, a function of some relatively recent changes in circumstances affecting fieldwork. During the past few years there has been an in- crease in government-sponsored "salvage" and "development" archaeology. Many of these pro- grams now boast active records with high-quality work. But they face certain kinds of dilemmas com- mon to public archaeology programs in general. Con- straints of time, budgets, and personnel can have the short-term effect of encouraging excavation to col- lect basic information while not promoting long-term development of research designs with strong pro- blem orientations. Basic information tends to be defined according to traditional requirements for culture-historical reconstruction. Compared to many other archaeological areas, conservation and restoration obligations in Mesoamerica can take a severe toll on budgets and time because of the nature of architectural, sculptural, and other remains. Fur- thermore, a tendency to concentrate fieldwork on sites which are "centers" can result in the collection of so many different kinds of information (often for several periods) that the identification of comprehen- sive research designs that are at once specific to a particular locality and regional or comparative in scope is an extremely complex and open-ended endeavor. And the eventual pay-off of problem- oriented research according to a comparative or regional design is often possible only with con- siderable stability in staffing and with relatively high levels of funding. It would appear that one of the challenges for governmental salvage and site- development programs lies in resolving ad- ministrative problems that can restrict the diversity of archaeological research engendered by them. Similar problems appear to be characteristic of all public archaeology programs; for example, some of these issues have been in the forefront of evaluations of public archaeology in the United States. AGENCIES. A number of changes occurred recently in the organization and personnel of the Mexicarn I.N.A.H., summarized here from informa- tion provided by Eduardo Matos M. (Consejo, I.N.- A.H.) Gast6n Garcia Cantui is the new director of the institute; Secretario General is Ariel Valencia. The Consejo de Arqueologia, which administers the regulations affecting field archaeology in Mexico, has 6 members who represent several major parts of the institute. President of the Consejo is Eduardo Matos M. Members are A. Ruz, representing the Museo Nacional de Antropologia, J. L. Lorenzo for the Depto. de Prehistoria, A. Garcia Cook for the Oficina de Salvamento, J. Angulo for the Centros Regionales, and A. Molina for the Depto. De Monumen- tos Histbricos. Regional offices of the I.N.A.H. have undergone fewer recent changes. G. Villa is head of the Centro Regional del Occidente, E. Castro, of the C. R. de Puebla-Tlaxcala, N. Gonzalez, of the C.R. del Sureste, M. Esparza, of the C.R. de Oaxaca, A. Oliveros, of the C.R. del Noroeste, R. Pifia Chan, of the C.R. del Edo. de Mexico and Michoacan, and R. Abascal, of the C.R. de Hidalgo. Delegation offices will be located in Chiapas (headed by J. Gussinyer), in Guanajuato, and in Zacatecas (headed by F. Sescosse). In 1977 the I.N.A.H. published a booklet titled "Disposiciones Reglamentarios para la Investigaci6n Arqueol6gica en M6xico." Investigators from foreign countries expecting to request permission for pro- jects can facilitate their planning if they obtain a copy. Matos has called attention to the schedule for review of proposals. Nine copies of a proposal should be sent to the Direccion General of the I.N.- A.H. in sufficient time for them to be distributed to the Consejo for review during the 2 established periods: January-February and July-August each year. Within 30 days after the close of a review period, the Consejo will respond to proposals. Ceramic reference collections are an objective of several institutions and investigators in Mexico. Col- lections are maintained by the Seccion de Ar- queologia (M.N.A.), by the Ceramoteca of the Depto. de Monumentos Prehispanicos (I.N.A.H.), and by the regional centers. The Secci6n de Arqueologia has in- augurated a new pamphlet series, "Notas de Ceramoteca." The first number, by Mari Cruz Paill6s (M.N.A.), describes the ceramic cataloging system. Evelyn Rattray (Instituto de Investigaciones An- 511</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tropol6gicas, U.N.A.M.) is assembling a ceramic reference collection at the national university; samples from clay sources are entered also in coor- dination with a neutron activation study described below. Archaeologists are encouraged to arrange for deposit of reference materials at the appropriate Mexican institutions in order to facilitate com- parative studies. Concomitantly, reports and publications will be more widely available for consultation if copies are given not only to the I.N.A.H. technical archive, but also to the small reference libraries maintained by relevant regional centers and departments of the I.N.A.H. During the past year the Mission Archeologique et Ethnologique Francaise au Mexique has been en- gaged in analysis and publishing efforts in addition to the inventory and packing of materials for I.N.A.H. Until a new director is chosen to replace Guy Stresser- Pean, who is leaving after nearly 2 decades of research in the Huasteca, the orientation of future field research has not been determined. Shortly the mission expects to publish a book dealing with Stresser-Pean's archaeological and ethnohistorical research in the Sierra de Tamaulipas. Two other ar- chaeological volumes are anticipated, 1 dealing with work which ended in 1973 at Tonina, Chiapas, by Pierre Becquelin and Claude F. Baudez, and 1 deal- ing with excavations on the Azuero Peninsula, Panama, by Alain Ichon. In addition, the mission hopes to begin publication of a journal which would include short reports and brief presentations of stu- dent thesis research conducted in conjunction with mission programs. Among the student projects cur- rently underway is Claire Cera's (U. Paris I) master's study of rock paintings in Mexico, which will include an inventory and analysis of known sites as well as results of field investigations at Cueva de la Chepa, Chiapas. Eric Taladoire (U. Paris) is directing his dissertation research toward Mesoamerican ball courts in relation to different types of ball games. He is particularly interested in fertility aspects of ball games. His work will include a survey of ethnohistoric data and a typological analysis of ball courts. As part of the study, ball courts were ex- cavated at San Antonio Nogalar, Tamaulipas, and at Tonina, Chiapas. Elizabeth Graham has become the Archaeological Commissioner of Belize and will be in charge of research permits. Jaime Awe is the Assistant Ar- chaeological Commissioner. Currently the ar- chaeological department (Ministry of Trade, In- dustry, Cooperatives and Consumer Protection) is not conducting field projects but may be able to in the near future. GENERAL. Two general "sourcing" projects were reported, one concerning ceramics, and the other, obsidian. Garman Harbottle and Edward V. Sayre (Brookhaven) are engaged in neutron activa- tion analysis of Mesoamerican ceramics and clays. The geochemical characterization of well- established "reference" archaeological ceramics and clays is one objective, along with the relation of new specimens to existing groups in order to establish probable geographic origins. The resulting multivariate data is analyzed through computer pro- grams. At present the data bank includes nearly 2000 analyses, of which more than 1000 are of Maya ceramics from the Palenque and Usumacinta- Grijalva region. Well-characterized ceramics include those from Classic Teotihuacan, Tlatilco, Lubaantin, El Tajin, the Tuxtla Mountains, and San Lorenzo. Particular ceramics that are well-characterized in- clude Tlahuica and Cholula polychromes, X, Y, and Z Fine Orange, Thin Orange, Lustrous Ware, and Teotihuacan Granular Ware. Clays from the Tehuacan Valley have been analyzed, but no ceramics. West Mexico, some Gulf Coast areas, Oax- aca, and a number of parts of the Maya lowlands are among the areas insufficiently represented in the data bank. Current studies in the ceramic sourcing project include (1) Palenque incensarios, (2) possible "Gulf Coast" trade wares from Teotihuacan and Cacaxtla, (3) Teotihuacan Thin Orange and "Thick" Thin Orange, (4) Coyotlatelco pottery, and (5) Old and New World postcontact Majolica. Archaeologists working on ceramic trade problems may contact Evelyn Rattray (U.N.A.M.) to discuss preliminarily the possibilities of neutron activation analysis. Rat- tray is also planning to act as a clearing center for application of archaeomagnetic dating to Mesoamerican samples. The latter work is in col- laboration with Robert Dubois (Oklahoma). Gary C. Allen (New Orleans) and associates, who are engaged in geological, geochemical, and petrographic study of Mexican obsidians, will at- tempt to expand their data bank and arrange for in- terlaboratory calibration. (The project was describ- ed in the previous Current Research report.) In- vestigators interested in participating should contact Allen. The project now has a computer program for use in artifact source assignment for exchange pat- tern studies. Horst Hartung (U. Guadalajara) and Anthony F. Aveni (Colgate) continue cooperative ar- chaeoastronomical studies in Mexico. Axial align- ment of Central Mexican structures and orientation of circular towers in Yucatan were previous foci of study. Most recently the investigators made scale drawings of pecked cross symbols in Central and Northwestern Mexico and measured their direc- tional orientation in an attempt to determine if they have astronomical significance. These crosses usual- ly consist of a double circle centered in a set of or- thogonal axes. Possible functions of the crosses were as astronomical devices, surveyor's benchmarks, calendars, or devices in ritual games. Three special meetings during the past year were reported. Processes of change in Mesoamerica and surrounding areas was the theme of the 15th Round Table Conference of the Sociedad Mexicana de An- tropologia held at the University of Guanajuato July 31-August 6, 1977. "A Puuc Symposium" addressed the culture history of that area in Yucatan in May 1977 at Central College in Iowa. In midsummer an in- ternational symposium on Maya art, architecture, ar- chaeology, and writing was held in Guatemala City, 512 [Vol. 43, No. 3,1978]</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH sponsored by the Foundation for Latin American An- thropological Research. VALLEY OF MEXICO. Thomas H. Charlton and Cynthia L. Charlton (Iowa), assisted by Barbara E. Borg (Iowa) and Evaristo Tenorio C., have completed the first step in a project to examine irrigation canals near Otumba, Edo. de Mexico, in order to document the technology and history of prehistoric irrigation in the area. Profiles of canals were noted in a road cut in an Aztec site (TA-80). Projected construction of a road through the canal area prompted salvage ef- forts. A topographic map, road cut profiles, and test trenches across some canals were accomplished dur- ing the past summer. Data are under study to deter- mine size, construction, and dates for the canals. Work anticipated next summer will attempt to date initial use of the canal system, its extent and form, and stream-channel erosion patterns during canal use. Climatologically oriented palynological studies and comparative study of the contemporary irriga- tion system will be pursued as well. Evidence to date indicates that except for the early post-Teotihuacan period (Xometla/Coyotlatelco), there was continuous use of the main canals from Terminal Formative to Late Postclassic times. However, there were varia- tions in the use of smaller diversionary and field canals. Analysis of the Toetihuacan ceramic chronology by Evelyn Rattray (U.N.A.M.) continues and will in- clude classification, description, and illustrations of the material in order provide a sequence useful for cross-dating throughout Mesoamerica. Some of the pottery is being analyzed by neutron activation (see above). C. Earle Smith (Alabama) is studying plant remains from Preclassic sites excavated by Paul Tolstoy (Queens). The Terremote site (QC-69) on the margins of Lake Chalco yielded both natural and gathered pla-ts in part because of lacustrine immersion of the site. At a higher elevation the Santa Catarina site also produced some flora, as did Coapexco (QC-110), near Amecameca. Smith has now completed fieldwork for his ecological survey of the zones sur- rounding the sites, which is preliminary to analysis of the floral remains. SAN LUIS POTOSI. The Rio Verde Valley was the focus of one of the more recent field projects of the French mission (see Agencies). Guy Stresser-Pean directed the project, assisted by Yves Baudouin, Dominique Michelet, Victor Lagarde, and Francois Rodriguez. A goal of the project is better description of the culture history of the northern Huastec border of Mesoamerica. With support from the Centre Na- tional de la Recherche Scientifique, project members surveyed within an area about 4000 km2 and located and mapped 135 sites, mainly in valley and piedmont locations. A third of these were large sites, number- ing over a hundred mounds, including public con- structions such as ball courts. Excavation had to be confined to test pits, which consequently restricted architectural data. Ceramic collections date from the Late Classic to Postclassic Periods and include the unusual feature of over 900 pipes. MICHOACAN. To study political and military power and the role of urban settlements in the development of independent states, Shirley Goren- stein (Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute) and Helen Pollard (S.U.N.Y., Plattsburgh) have initiated a study of the protohistoric Tarascan state. The project is jointly sponsored by NSF and NEH. Field research in the Lake Patzcuaro Basin during 1976 and 1977 primarily involved gathering environmental, ethnohistoric, and ethnoarchaeological data. Ethnohistoric and ecological analyses will continue during the current year. Using aerial photographs, field surveys, and ethnographic and ethnohistoric data, the investigators will develop a series of models relating ecological zones, settlement systems, and land use in the basin. Models will be periodized: for modern times (1974-1977), for the recent past (1940-1945), and for the early colonial period (1525-1540). Projection of aspects of these models, combined with archaeological data, will generate a description of expected human adaptation and settle- ment in the core of the Tarascan state. Attention will focus on regularities in resource exploitation, in- tersettlement patterns, and the distribution of sociopolitical power within the basin. MORELOS-GUERRERO. Laboratory analysis and report preparation continue for the Chalcatzingo, Morelos, project, directed by David C. Grove (Illinois). Just completed is the neutron activation of Chalcatzingo obsidian artifacts and of a large number of source samples, including a new source, Paredon, discovered by Thomas Charlton (Iowa). Charlton found this source south of Tulancingo on the Puebla-Hidalgo border. The project approach to neutron activation is different from that of previous investigations in that all obsidians were analyzed for 33 elements rather than the standard 3-6. Four dif- ferent cluster programs were run on the data, all with similar results. One important outcome is that the Paredon source is indistinguishable from Otumba in the Teotihuacan Valley if the standard 3-6 elements are used; however, Paredon is easily distinguished if barium, arsenic, and some other elements are measured. This seems particularly im- portant for the Early Preclassic Period, for previous results have indicated that much obsidian in the Cen- tral Highlands was derived from Otumba. However, 8 of the 9 Early Preclassic samples from Chalcat- zingo were from Paredon, suggesting that it may have been more significant in early exchange than previously thought. OAXACA. Since 1974 the Seccion de Ar- queologia (C.R. Oaxaca) has carried out research in the Mixteca Alta and Cafiada regions. Currently the archaeological staff comprises Marcus C. Winter, Margarita Gaxiola, Gilberto Hernandez, Daria Deraga, and Rodolfo Fernandez. Investigations in these areas of Oaxaca, which are environmen- tally distinct from the Valley of Oaxaca, are expected 513</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY to permit interregional comparisons of societal development, especially the emergence and interac- tion among different ethnic and linguistic groups. Principal sites excavated include: in 1974 Huamelulpan near Tlaxiaco (a Late Preclassic and Classic site); in 1975 Rancho Dolores Ortiz (Early Preclassic) and Hacienda Tecomaxtlahua (Late Preclassic), near Cuicatlan; and in 1976-77 Yucuita, near Nochixtlan (primarily a Late Preclassic and Early Classic site). The center staff accomplished several minor excavations elsewhere. Notable among the latter are: the salvage of 11 Postclassic tombs at Ayotzintepec, in the Chinantla region; exploration of Tomb 11 at Lambityeco; in the Valley of Oaxaca. where carved bone artifacts were recovered and Monte Alban IV murals were found decorating the tomb walls; and excavation of a high-status Postclassic residence at Teotitlan del Camino. The Centro now publishes a Boletin and a series called Estudios de Antropologia e Historia, both containing descriptions of recent research. A list of publications can be obtained from the Centro at H. Colegio Militar 219, Col. Reforma, Oaxaca, Oaxaca. Joyce Marcus (Michigan) has completed the first half of a 10-year project to record and analyze Zapotec monuments in the Valley of Oaxaca. These monuments provide information on calendrics, royal marriages, militarism, religion, and political events. Already photographed for this NEH-funded project are over 500 monuments spanning the period 1000 B.C. to the Spanish conquest; to date nearly 200 also have been drawn professionally. Marcus intends to publish her results in a monograph. Activities in the 1977 season of the Valley of Oax- aca Settlement Pattern Project involved systematic mapping of the southern arm, roughly 700 km2. Richard Blanton (Purdue) was assisted by Steve Kowalewski (Hunter), Gary Feinman (C.U.N.Y., Graduate Center), and Jill Appel (Purdue). Nearly 1000 sites were located, mapped, and described. Oc- cupations varied in age from Early Preclassic times to the conquest period. Current information suggests that post-Middle Preclassic societies underwent set- tlement cycles somewhat comparable to the Valley of Mexico, but that overall regional organization was distinct from the Central Basin. In Oaxaca there is less tendency toward a "primate" rank-size distribu- tion, and there is less evidence for highly centralized commodity production. Blanton interprets these data, along with those from other regions of Mesoamerica, as indicative of regional diversity in evolutionary cultural patterns. A settlement pattern survey is underway in the Tamazulapan Valley in the Mixteca Alta. Bruce Byland (Pennsylvania State) is conducting the study with support from Wenner-Gren and the Hill Fund at Pennsylvania State. The development of social stratification and political centralization in the area will be examined within an ecological framework. Of particular interest is the relationship of ar- chaeological data to ethnohistoric records of the Mix- tec kingdoms of Tejupan and Tamazulapan. Surface survey was divided into 2 stages. An intensive survey attempted to locate all sites in the valley. Subse- quently a subset of sites was selected for controlled surface collection. With computer analysis of ar- tifactual data, Byland is examining within- and between-site functional variations. PUEBLA-TLAXCALA. At the regional center several projects are underway. Data for an ar- chaeological atlas for the 2 states are being collected by Diana L6pez, Eduardo Merlo, and Daniel Molina (C.R. Puebla-Tlaxcala). Aerial photointerpretation permits the investigators to identify many of the sites, which are then visited for description, mapping, and surface collection. Test pits are excavated at some sites and the stratigraphic material is analyzed also for the atlas. The third and final season of the Cacaxtla project has been completed under the direction of L6pez and Molina. This Tlaxcalan site, remarkable for its murals, is located in the municipio of Nativitas. At present the site is thought to have been most exten- sive between 800 and 900 A.D. In addition to excava- tion of the buldings with painted murals, test pits and trenches have been placed in the peripheral area. More than 9 radiocarbon dates are expected from the site. Tepexi el Viejo, near the Pueblan border with Oax- aca, is a fortified site investigated earlier by Shirley Gorenstein. Merlo is now directing a project funded by the I.N.A.H. to investigate an occupation zone west of the walled structures of the main site. This zone is thought to have been a Mexica residential area associated with the fortified constructions. The present project, which began in 1975 and will con- tinue through 1978, has completed mapping and documentary studies. At Cholula current salvage excavations, directed by Merlo, who is assisted by Julie Chenel, are ex- pected to continue through 1978. The project will at- tempt to establish the extent of the prehistoric city at various periods. Stratigraphic test pits and trenches in areas surrounding the main pyramid have produc- ed both habitation and ceremonial remains. In addi- tion, regulation of construction in modern Cholula permits the archaeologists to mitigate urban destruc- tion of prehistoric remains. Funds for the project have been allocated by the I.N.A.H. and the Fomento Nacional de Turismo. By the end of 1977 Merlo expects to complete recording of painted murals at the Cholula ar- chaeological zone. Several relatively well-preserved mural sections have been discovered from various periods in the city's history. For example, the mural known as "Los Bebedores" is 62 m long. Ultimately photographs and drawings of the various murals will be prepared to facilitate comparative studies. In 1973-74 salvage excavations in the Cholula area at the ex-hacienda Sta. Catarina Martir were directed by Paul Schmidt. Analysis of the resulting collections led Richard Baravalle and Thomas Wheaton (U. Americas) to conclude that this zone sustained a Middle Preclassic occupation. Excava- tions at one locality on the ex-hacienda indicated flooding of the easternmost section of Cholula during the transition to Early Classic times. According to 514 [Vol. 43, No. 3,1978]</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH Baravalle, preliminary analysis of other material at Cholula done in 1976 suggests still earlier occupation dating to the Early Preclassic Period. This extension of the Cholula sequence would make it a particularly noteworthy archaeological zone because of the length of sedentary occupation. The Palo Blanco Project, directed by Robert D. Drennan (Pittsburgh), continued with excavations begun previously at the Late Preclassic site of Quachilco. Test pits and some expanded excavations sampled deposits in residential areas surrounding the site's central plaza. According to current infor- mation, the occupational sequence began with a small settlement near the central plaza approximate- ly in the middle of the Santa Maria phase. Soon con- struction began on the major mounds at the site, and population grew until abandonment in the early Palo Blanco phase. Analysis of excavated material is ex- pected to allow definition of the site's internal organization. Judith E. Smith (Michigan) conducted flotation to recover plant remains from Quachilco and did ethnobotanical fieldwork to facilitate their archaeological interpretation. In a related aspect of the project Elsa M. Redmond (Yale) began surface survey in the Cafiada zone at the extreme downstream end of the Tehuacan Valley. The survey focuses on the Late Preclassic and Classic Periods, although all sites are being recorded. The Caiiada zone straddles Puebla and Oaxaca and was chosen for study because settlement pattern data there will be useful in the comparison of social developments with those in the Tehuacan and Oaxaca Valleys. CHIAPAS. Two investigations were reported by individuals working with the New World Ar- chaeological Foundation. Brian Hayden (Simon Fraser) has begun the Coxoh Ethnoarchaeology Pro- ject, supported also by the Canada Council. In addition to the description and study of the Coxoh through archaeology and ethnohistory, the project is designed to examine acculturation follow- ing the Spanish conquest. Hayden will attempt to isolate diagnostic elements of the process, ones which may help interpretation of conquest acculturation in prehistoric instances. The now-extinct Coxoh Maya were congregated into 5 small communities by the Spanish in the 16th century. Two mapping and ex- cavations seasons have been completed at Coneta and Coapa, 2 of the 5 Coxoh sites, which are relative- ly well-preserved. At Coapa, excavations were in the church complex, and at Coneta, excavations were in domestic structures and in round, rock-edged features in addition to the church complex. A number of analyses are underway, such as of faunal remains (fresh water snails are a frequent faunal element) and of lithics. Lithics appear to be distributed in such a way that obsidian blades are negatively correlated with metal "kitchen-type" knives, suggesting a replacement process. During 1977 members of the project began ethnoarchaeological studies in sur- rounding Maya communities, which are expected to provide comparative data on material correlates of behaviors. At a nearby Tzeltal community, Hayden and 3 student assistants began study of (1) structures and features; (2) refuse deposition; (3) pottery manufacture and pottery characteristics, including vessel use, reuse, and deposition; (4) functions and distribution of lithics; and (5) social and economic in- stitutions, especially as they relate to material re- mains, such as public buildings, and to settlement pattern features, such as barrios. Ray Matheny (Brigham Young) and Deanne Gurr examined evidence of prehistoric use of soil and water resources in the Upper Grijalva Basin by tak- ing aerial photographs and conducting ground survey to verify photointerpretations. Near the Guatemalan border numerous dams, fossilized canals, and small channels were found in the vicinity of the Lagartero site. Thousands of rock and soil terraces and check dams were found throughout the upper basin and in the mountains near Comitan. The investigators noted evidence of cenotes, springs, lakes, and reservoirs, and they discovered ancient walk-in wells at several sites. In some localities nearly the entire landscape was manipulated to conserve water and soil for agriculture. YUCATAN, QUINTANA ROO, CAMPECHE. Dur- ing 1976 Prentice Thomas directed archaeological fieldwork at the site of Rio Bec in southeastern Campeche. Excavation centered at Temple B, which also required consolidation to prevent structural col- lapse. Interpretation of the function of this building will be a major thrust of the final report. Excavated materials indicate that this temple dates to a single phase of construction in the Late Classic Period. An above-floor midden in Room A marks the final oc- cupation of the structure in terminal Late Classic Chintok and Xcocom phases. A stratified random sampling program in the vicinity of the structure located refuse dumps and quarry areas invisible from the surface. Another aspect of the excavation program was the testing of several housemounds near Temple B. Occupation in these mounds also dated to the Late Classic. Part of the effort in the pro- ject was directed at preparation of a detailed site map at 1:1000, covering an area approximately 400 by 400 m in the vicinity of Temple B. Beyond the bounds of this map, surface reconnaissance covered the entire Rio Bec site; previously located groups were found as well as new structures, all of which were plotted on a general site map. Irwin Rovner (Foundation for Illinois Archaeology) has completed calibration of X-ray emission tests on obsidians from the sites of Becan and Chicanna, with changes in the results previously reported in current research. The bulk of obsidian does not come from Mexican sources, but from El Chayal, Guatemala. Substantial fluctuation in minority sources through time is currently being evaluated; San Martin Jilotepeque, Guatemala, is a source only in the Preclassic; Central Mexican obsidian appears at the start of the Early Classic; Ixtepeque, Guatemala, ob- sidian appears for the first time at the end of the Ear- ly Classic. No Mexican obsidian occurs in the Late Classic, but both highland Mexican and Ixtepeque sources are strongly represented in the terminal Classic and Early Postclassic. None of the Mexican 515</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY obsidian derives from sources in Veracruz or Puebla, the areas geographically closest to the Maya lowlands, but, rather, from sources in or near the Valley of Mexico. The Maya Salt Project being conducted by Tony Andrews (Arizona) is concerned with the develop- ment of Maya salt trade. Existing salt sources in the Maya area are being examined to determine the mode of production and quantities produced. Com- plementary research focuses on modern consumption and trade. Ethnohistoric and ethnographic data are being examined as well to develop trade models. Ar- chaeological site survey focuses on salt production centers and on sites which were nodes along presum- ed trade routes. Andrews hopes to reconstruct the direction and volume of prehispanic trade in salt and assess its economic and political role in Maya history. The Coba Archaeological Mapping Project is one aspect of the previously reported general Coba pro- ject directed by Norberto Gonzalez C. (C.R. Sureste). The mapping project is directed by William J. Folan (U. Yucatan) and George Stuart (N.G.S.) In 1974-1975 the field work in Quintana Roo was pursued with the assistance of graduate students and staff. A detailed plan of the city is expected to assist in formulation of hypotheses about its social and political organization. Although only 30% of the 63 km2 site has been inven- toried and mapped, there are already indications that Coba was an urban center. It appears to have been divided into 4 or more wards by an extensive system of roads. Approximately 55,000 individuals are estimated to have inhabited the settlement in a concentric residence pattern during the period 600-800 A.D. Folan infers that the site was the capital of a regional state. E. Wyllys Andrews, IV, reports that the Middle American Research Institute is currently engaged in preparation and publication of reports from the Na- tional Geographic Society-Tulane field program in Yucatan and Campeche, 1955-1971. Dzibilchaltfin, Becan, and a coastal survey are subjects of reports in press or in preparation. BELIZE. The reasons for the survival of Lamanai during and after the Classic collapse of other centers is a principal focus of research there, along with its role in Postclassic peninsular trade and politics. Ongoing work at this site in the Orange Walk District (see previous report) is supported by the Royal On- tario Museum and the Canada Council and is directed by David Pendergast at the museum. Ar- chitectural explorations continue, including work at the Franciscan church and its cemetery. To date pro- ject data are most plentiful for the Postclassic, although earlier architectural remains indicate the site's prior importance. More than 200 Postclassic burials have been recovered, and most were accom- panied by grave goods. Ceramic affinities with Mayapan do not override the numerous unique features of a collection of 250 whole vessels and a large Postclassic sherd sample. During the next 2 seasons Classic and Preclassic remains will be the principal targets of investigation. The Corozal Project, which has conducted fieldwork since 1973, recently has been concerned with the Cuello site. Investigations at Cuello directed by Norman Hammond (Rutgers) demonstrated oc- cupation in the Early Preclassic Period. Although no further fieldwork occurred in 1977, major excava- tion is planned for 1978-80. Meanwhile, laboratory analysis by Arlene Miller (Washington State, Pullman) has disclosed opal phyoliths of maize or a similar plant in the lowest midden levels, ca. 2000 or 2500 B.C. Manos and metates are also present, sug- gesting a seed-using subsistence pattern. However, wet-screening of carbonized materials by Barbara Pickersgill (Reading) yielded no macro-fossil seed re- mains. Two sets of radiocarbon dates have been published in Nature, which gives a total of 27 from the site, of which 20 are considered stratigraphically consistent in support of the Preclassic chronology. Elizabeth Graham (Cambridge) completed 3 field seasons in the Stann Creek District in east-central Belize. On the basis of site survey and excavations she has defined a regional chronology from Middle Preclassic to Late Classic times. Graham also en- countered evidence of considerable prehistoric ex- ploitation of marine resources, especially mollusks. GUATEMALA. Preliminary testing of side- looking airborne radar for survey in northern Guatemala was authorized for the fall of 1977. Bruce H. Dahlin (Catholic) and Walter E. Brown (Jet Propul- sion Laboratory) received funds from Ames Research Corporation and NASA to conduct this project. Ground truth survey and spatial analyses will be per- formed by a research team comprising R.E.W. Adams (Texas, San Antonio), T. Patrick Culbert (Arizona), and Barbara L. Stark (Arizona State). The instruments will permit all-weather imaging and some canopy penetration; 10,000 km2 are targeted for radar imaging, with primary concentration on Tikal, El Mirador, and the middle Pasi6n River. Earth resources survey (e.g., of soils, vegetation, hydrography, geology) and archaeological survey (e.g., of major sites, terracing, roads, raised fields) are objectives of the radar project. It is hoped the coverage will allow more effective governmental management of archaeological resources as well as locational analyses of prehistoric remains. With the financial backing of the Banco Cen- troamericano de Integraci6n Econ6mica, the Instituto de Antropologia e Historia in Guatemala will initiate the Proyecto Nacional Tikal during the next year. Ac- cording to current plans, new excavations will be opened in the central area of Tikal and possibly in neighboring centers. Some research facilities and visitor services will be constructed; at the same time, some construction will be directed toward develop- ment of services for modern villages in the vicinity. During 1977 the Quirigua project (see report in previous current research) finished its fourth season with continued excavation and analyses of pottery and monuments. The project is designed for cultural- historical and functional interpretations of Quirigua. The field director, Robert Sharer (Pennsylvania), reports that excavations documented the basic con- 516 [Vol. 43, No. 3,1978]</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH struction sequence in the Acropolis and neighboring Monument Plaza. In the Acropolis 4 construction stages correspond to 600-950 A.D. Excavations also attempted to resolve functions of structures; the Acropolis seems to have served multiple functions that shifted through time, resulting in its final use primarily as an elite residental-administrative com- plex. Nine sites within the Quirigua periphery were excavated to determine their chronological place- ment and functions. Among these sites were an obsi- dian workshop, a midden with debris from an adja- cent ceramic workshop, and 3 residential- administrative complexes, apparently subordinate to Quirigua proper. The monument program continued successful application of microflora retardants to sculptures as well as recording of inscriptions. Pro- ject members completed type and form classification of pottery and began temporal and functional analysis of ceramics from different parts of the site. Obsidian extraction, distribution, and manufac- ture are the subjects of a study initiated by Payson D. Sheets (Colorado). The project will focus on Quirigua. The first phase was a technological and functional analysis of Quirigua obsidian. As expected, a core- blade reduction process predominated, character- ized by importation of macro-cores and occasional removal of percussion blades, followed by production of large numbers of prismatic blades in craft districts north of the Acropolis. However, a hitherto unreported percussion industry was used in rural areas of the Motagua Valley, which may imply class differentiation in lithics. In the rural localities, villagers collected small obsidian cobbles from river alluvium and produced percussion flakes. A second phase of the project involved collection of source samples from outcrops in the Guatemalan highlands. Sheets made brief observations on both quarrying and knapping debitage and noted considerable com- plexity and volume in quarrying and production. The third phase of the project will be trace element "sourcing" at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory under the direction of Fred Stross and Frank Asaro. A member of the Mission Arch6ologique et Ethnologique Francaise au Mexique, Marie Charlotte Arnauld, completed 2 years of fieldwork in 1974-75 in Western Alta Verapaz (Coban-Tactic) and in Nor- thern Baja Verapaz, Guatemala, assisted by Patricia Carot. During settlement pattern survey, over 40 sites were located, described, and mapped. Most are small sites which include some mounds arranged around a plaza; ball courts were infrequent. In Baja Verapaz (Purulha) densely grouped low mounds are found around plazas. Text excavations at 14 sites provided the data for an occupation sequence ap- parently continuous from Protoclassic to Late Postclassic times. There was also some evidence for Early Preclassic occupation. Cultural affiliations are interpreted by Arnauld to be stronger with the highlands, especially in the Salama and Motagua regions, than with the lowlands. In the department of El Quich6 in the Guatemala highlands, comprehensive survey since 1972 has focused on the area between the Sierra de Chuacus and the Chixoy River, approximately 500 km2. This survey is part of a field program directed by Henri Lehmann with archaeologists Alain Ichon and Marie- France Fauvet; support is from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and the Ministbre des Affaires Etrangeres. Survey will be continued in the area to be flooded in 1980 by the Pueblo Viejo-Quizal dam. In the study zone Middle Preclassic to Late Postclassic occulpation is indicated by survey data. The project also has been engaged in excavations at small ceremonial centers representative of each established cultural phase: San Andres Sajcabaja (Preclassic), La Lagunita (Protoclassic and Early Classic), Los Cerritos-Chijoj (Late Classic), Los Cimientos-Chustum (Late Postclassic), and Pueblo Viejo-Chichaj (Protohistoric). At La Lagunita, Ichon reports an artificial cave which had unusually rich burials, with a carved stone sarcophagus, over 250 Protoclassic vessels, and other grave goods. Excava- tions will continue at La Lagunita in 1978. The Guatemalan site of Abaj Takalik has been the object of another season of explorations directed by John Graham (Berkeley), assisted by Edwin M. Shook and Marion Popenoe de Hatch. T.R. Hester (Texas, San Antonio) is analyzing obsidian from the site. Dur- ing 1977 mapping continued along with efforts to date more precisely the placement of various monumental sculptures. Abaj Takalik, obscured by a deep deposit of volcanic ash and covered by coffee groves, extends approximately 8 km2 as measured by mound and terrace construction. The site is therefore larger than previously thought even though mapping is not yet completed. Architecture of the site consists of terraces, large platforms, and pyramidal struc- tures. Buildings are primarily of earthen construc- tion although there was considerable use of andesite cobbles for pavements, ramps, mound facings, and stairways. A colorful, variegated, local clay was employed frequently for court floors. Considerable effort was devoted to the dating of the positioning of many of the site's sculptures. During the 1977 season it was possible to demonstrate that the "museum galleries," where monuments of various styles were aligned, were the work of Late Classic occupants who rearranged Preclassic sculptures in conjunction with alterations and additions to older buildings. These people also buried fragments of sculptures together with rich cached offerings. Among over 40 caches excavated near the surface of a single plat- form was a spectacular carved stone box containing jades and miniature ceramic vessels. In a few in- stances caches associated with repositioned monuments contained both Preclassic as well as Late Classic pottery, and the Preclassic vessels may have been salvaged from the sculpture's earlier position- ing. One sculpture discovered in 1977 was carved as a "colossal" head, stylistically closer to the Olmec heads of the Gulf coast than to the giant heads from Monte Alto southeast of Abaj Takalik; later the head was cut back to create a niche for a seated human figure in Olmec style. Ceramics excavated in the course of architectural excavations in various mounds suggest Abaj Takalik was a major Preclassic center. To date success in discovering habitation areas is mixed. An area of deeply buried bottle- 517</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY shaped pits with Late Classic domestic refuse was located, but a habitation zone of Preclassic oc- cupants has not yet been found. The latter will be a major goal of the next season of investigation. HONDURAS. The Copan Valley settlement pat- tern project completed its second and final field season (see previous report) directed by Gordon Willey (Harvard), assisted by Richard M. Leventhal (Harvard) and William L. Fash (Harvard). Variations in settlement density and architecture are evident in different natural zones of the valley. Areas mapped in detail by project members lie to the east and north of the center where both bottomland and hillslope terrain occur. About 300 "residential" units have been discovered and mapped. These units are mound clusters, usually organized around court areas. They may number from 2 to 3 mounds or as many as 50 in a single unit. A tentative classification has been established, with 4 ranked orders of units. The types are graduated in the maximum size of mounds and complexity of layout around plazas, as well as in the use of masonry architecture. Excavation data seem to support the assumption that the larger, more elaborately arranged units were residences of greater wealth and prestige than the smaller ones. To date one unit representative of each of the first 3 residential types has been completely excavated; all were constructed and occupied ca. 450-800 A.D. The first type seems to have been a modest residence. The second and third types produced evidence of wealth and status indicated by tombs, grave goods, and exotic materials. In the third type site, the ex- cavators encountered a carved bench or throne situated in a temple or palace room. The bench bore a freize of hieroglyphs executed in the high-relief style characteristic of Copan. The Copan emblem glyph appears along with what seems to be a period ending date of 780 A.D. Willey notes that this seems to be the first instance in the Maya area in which such a "hierarchic" manifestation has been found so far out from a main center. The discovery raises questions about the purposes of the various "residen- tial" structures. In particular, the distinction bet- ween elite residences and minor ceremonial centers seemed blurred. No excavations were directed at the largest, most complex of the residential types, but it might be anticipated that such units would reveal even more evidence of internal wealth and hierar- chic symbols than the third type. A study of the Copan natural environment and its use by the Maya was the objective of fieldwork by B.L. Turner (Oklahoma) aided by William Johnson. Although valley bottom soils are fertile, the in- vestigators discovered some remains of construc- tions to enhance agriculture. Hillslopes were ter- raced and a small dam was built. A continuing program of archaeological work at Copan will be directed by Claude Baudez (Mus6e de 1'Homme) for the Honduran government. Funds will be provided by the Banco Centroamericano de In- tegraci6n Econ6mica and the Banco Mundial. Fieldwork will be combined with restoration and con- solidation. Research will be pursued on settlement pattern and soil use in the Copan Valley using aerial photographs as well as on the effects of microflora on carved stone. Archaeological fieldwork will in- clude a magnetometer survey of the great plaza, recording of sculptures, test trenches in the Acropolis, and other excavations. The banks also have allocated funds for construction of storage facilities, laboratories, and meeting rooms. Some construction funds will be devoted to modern rural development in the area as well. The Honduran Instituto de Antropologia has spon- sored salvage excavations at numerous mounds in the Sula Valley, which are threatened by grading operations to prepare land for sugar cane. Primarily Late Classic occupation is reported at excavated sites, and a range of ceramic styles seems to be represented. Additional work is planned in the valley. EL SALVADOR. At the Preclassic site of Santa Leticia in Ahuachapan, Arthur Demarest (Harvard) began the first season of excavations sponsored by the Museo Nacional "David J. Guzman" in El Salvador. This site, located in the volcanic highlands of western El Salvador, has an enormous artifical terrace supporting 3 massive "pot-bellied" sculptures. During the 1977 season Demarest map- ped and test pitted the 15 ha site area, excavated in the great terrace, and explored the 5 mounds in the site's ceremonial zone. Because the terrace sculptures are in situ, the associated ceramics and carbon samples are expected to date the "pot- bellied" style securely. Two additional sculptures, both conventionalized jaguar faces, manifest stylistic ties to Preclassic sculptures on the Pacific coast of Guatemala. However, one of the most important finds was the discovery of the village habitation area con- temporary with the great terrace, monuments, and mounds in the later Middle to Late Preclassic. In the habitation zone were a number of large bottle-shaped trash pits rich in ceramics, obsidian, artifacts, car- bon, and flora. Since part of the habitation area is sealed by a volcanic ash fall, stratigraphic control is excellent. Demarest expects to produce a synchronic interpretation of cultural patterns and adaptations during the occupation period. The synchronic reconstruction will be combined with comparative analysis of the ceramics, sculptures, and architec- ture to elucidate Middle to Late Preclassic highland interaction and evolution. WESTERN AND NORTHERN MEXICO JALISCO. The Centro Regional del Occidente is to be congratulated for its prompt, thorough publica- tion of the results of salvage investigations 1974-76 at a construction site in Zapopan, north of Guadala- jara. This report on a series of tombs near the ar- chaeological zone of El Grillo by Luis Javier Galvan V. has been published by I.N.A.H. in Cuadernos de los Centros, no. 28. Excavated tombs fell into 2 classes, shaft tombs and rectangular tombs, the former thought to date to the Early Classic, and the latter, to the Late Clasic to Early Postclassic. Numerous offer- 518 [Vol. 43, No. 3, 1978]</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEARCH ings accompanied the burials. The burial area is in- terpreted as part of a habitation zone associated with El Grillo. A third field session of the I.N.A.H. Tomatlan Valley salvage project in central coastal Jalisco was directed by Joseph B. Mountjoy (North Carolina) assisted by Raul Jimenez O., Patricia Monsivais G., Angeles Olay B., and Sergio Sanchez C. (all Escuela Nacional de Antropologia) and Emilia Gaitan (Sria. de Agricultura y Recursos Hidraulicos). Survey of sites in the 20,000-ha irrigation zone was designed to provide a better context for understanding previous- ly studied sites in the now-flooded dam basin. In addi- tion, the survey will assist planning for conservation or development of selected sites in the floodplain when that area is converted to canal irrigation. Both sides of the Tomatlan river were surveyed, from the town of Tomatlan to the Pacific coast (20 km), with approximately 100 habitation sites recorded. About 500 petroglyphs were discovered associated with some of the habitation sites. Analysis of pottery sug- gests 4 major periods of cultural development, from about 200 B.C. to the time of Spanish contact. The earliest, correlated with the Tuxcacuesco-Ortices and Early Morett complexes, was further in- vestigated through a 2-m test pit in a rich deposit of stratified village refuse. The one other excavation was a test trench in a low mound with abundant Az- tatlan complex pottery plus other remains. SONORA. Brief notes are available for projects in Sonora sponsored through the C.R. del Noroeste. Projects reported last year continue. In addition, Ar- turo Oliveros (C. R. Noroeste) is investigating Jesuit and Franciscan missions in the Cocospera Valley. Preliminary work will determine if these sites can be restored or salvaged and a small museum construc- ted. In the Rio Zanjon area finds of Llano material have prompted Julio Montane (C. R. Noroeste) to at- tempt to locate and excavate Paleoindian sites. A useful overview and summary of Sonoran ar- chaeology by Beatriz Braniff has been published by the Centro as Cuadernos de los Centros 25. Barbara L. Stark LOWER CENTRAL AMERICA Field projects in the area continue to follow the pattern established by Linares and Ranere at the beginning of the decade, by providing a more multi- farious approach to prehistory than the mere estab- lishment of local sequences and ceramic-biased cul- tural inventories. More and more investigators are searching for functionally significant features and in- trasite differences by incorporating horizontal as well as vertical excavations; more time is being dedicated to the recovery of nonartifactual remains so that a good body of faunal data is appearing; and finally, a wider spectrum of analytical techniques is being employed. One might single out, in this last con- text, the papers presented at the AAA's 1977 meet- ing: X-ray diffraction analysis of pottery (Richard M. Accola); soil analyses of archaeological profiles (William Hurley); the biological modeling of shellfish populations (Jean-Francois Moreau). It is hoped that this healthy trend will continue in the future; there is plenty of scope in lower Central America for those in- terested in the application of new methods. This area of research is, unfortunately, still beset with a certain overhastiness in making comparisons between newly discovered ceramic "complexes" and assumed counterparts from outside the area's bound- aries. One cannot deny that the establishment of the developmental foci of the Macro-Chibchan-speaking groups and of their various adaptive transformations is a fundamental problem which has to be tackled, but precipitously asserting this contact here and that contact there is of little substantive value. The geographical and temporal blind spots in our knowl- edge must be filled in before "origins," "diffusions," and "radiations" can acquire any meaning at all. In the editor's limited experience, nearly every Forma- tive pottery complex that appears looks both slightly different from that of the next-door site and remark- ably similar to any other Formative series from Loui- siana to Tierra del Fuego. Besides, especially as regards the assumed functions of pottery vessels, similarities may well have arisen from the applica- tion of comparable technologies to similar challenges in similar subsistence environments. Another problem that is becoming serious in this area is that of the interpretation of radiocarbon dates. In Panama, for example, where there are now nearly 70 C-14 determinations (many of these long stratigraphic series from sites that were excavated by natural as opposed to "arbitrary" levels), a number of discrepancies are appearing within the stratigraphic series. These discrepancies appear both between groups of samples from the same ar- chaeological contexts that were sent on different oc- casions to the same laboratory and between assays run on a single sample by 2 different laboratories. Of course, there are a number of very good reasons why there should have been such inconsistencies: care- lessness on the part of the excavators; leaving the sample for too long in a mold-charged environment; the incorporation of carbon of different ages in a single sample because of prehistoric disturbances (as at Monagrillo, this report); the reuse of geologic car- bon of a very great age (as at Sitio Sierra); the failure to identify and isolate sporadic occupations that predate the major deposits at a site and whose car- bon is subsequently confused with that of later events; and the impossibility of cleaning off all the humic acids and carbonates at the laboratory (often because the sample sent them is too small to with- stand the necessary treatment). Through the years, it has been amply demonstrated that radiocarbon is not the panacea for dating problems it was once thought to be. But it does seem as though tropical samples are particularly erratic. For this reason, it is very dangerous to accept as incontrovertible time-mark- ers single dates acquired in a single pit or stratum. To people accustomed to large grants for analyzing dates, this seems all too obvious; in these 3 countries it leads to a dilemma. 519</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY NICARAGUA. Jorge Espinosa E. (Instituto Geografico Nacional) reports what he hopes will be a temporary lull in his excavations at the El Bosque site (Esteli), where human activities have been suspected in association with a fauna that is probably older than 30,000 years (J. Espinosa: "Excavaciones Ar- queol6gicas en El Bosque. Informe No. 1." Inst. Geog. Nac., Managua D. N., 1976). Meanwhile, the Nicara- quan government's touristic priorities have required that he concentrate on excavations at the Acahualin- ca or El Cauce site, where human footprints in mud flows are exposed for public viewing (F. B. Richard- son: "Nicaragua." Carnegie Institute, Washington. Year Book 40: 300-302, 1941). By resorting to more painstaking techniques than those used in the past, he expects to be able to determine the precise stratigraphic relationship of the prints, both with the 14 or so layers he has identified preliminarily at the site (some of which contain ceramics) and also with a master sequence of volcanic and seismic activity that is presently being worked out for the Managua area. He hopes to recover organic material which, he believes, will show that the footprints are older than the 3000 B.C. date attributed to them on the basis of a C-14 date, on the soil beneath the mud layer, of 5945 145 radiocarbon years: 3995 B.C. (Alan Bryan: Archaeology 26(2): 146-147, 1973). Of potential interest is Espinosa's find of what he calls "typologically" crude stone tools at El Transito, on the Pacific coast due west of Managua. Mammoth remains have been found nearby in the past. How- ever, the tools had been washed out by stream ac- tivity from an undertermined locus and a search is being made for in situ materials. Richard Magnus (Banco Central de Nicaragua) has completed his 7-year (1971-77) project along the Atlantic coast. One thesis that he has been building, that many of the coastal sites were the fishing sta- tions of more permanent agricultural settlements located further inland (see under the Kukra Point and Italia sites, "Current Research" 42 (2): 281, 1977), has been advanced by the reexcavation of many of the pertinent sites, with more rigorous recovery techniques. The fear that faulty recovery may have been responsible for the seemingly depauperate faunal samples found at the coastal localities, was dispelled by the fact that the only bones found were fish otoliths: Magnus speculates that these would have been the most likely bones to have been left if the fish had been dried for consumption else- where-the skulls would have been split open, caus- ing the otoliths to drop out. Work on Corn Island, situated 80 km offshore from Bluefields, has indicated that its prehistory belongs to the same traditions as those of the southern main- land. However, its primary subsistence resource seems to have been agriculture rather than fishing. Magnus is investigating in what ways economic and/or social pressures on the mainland might have been responsible for the colonization of the island. A new, early painted ceramic complex has been identified by Magnus at Caroline Creek, a 2-component site whose uppermost layers contain the already defined Siteia Complex; C-14 dates will soon be available, and a span of ca. 2000-1000 B.C. is suggested for the new complex. Abundant faunal ma- terial was recovered from this site. Important dietary elements were Donax denticulatus and Neocyrena cf. nicaraguana. However, the much greater proportion of the former in the sample contradicts the data from all the other Atlantic coast shell middens, in which Neocyrena is the commonest shell. COSTA RICA. Michael J. Snarskis (Museo Na- cional and Columbia University) is continuing his researches into both Paleoindian and Formative sites on the Atlantic slopes. Surface collections at the Turrialba (9-FG-T) site have taken the total of Paleo- indian artifacts recovered here to 19, with the re- covery of the fifth Clovis-like point. A new Early Formative ceramic complex has been identified in the Turrialba Valley, stratified beneath a cemetery that dates between A.D. 400 and 700. Baptized the La Montafia Complex by Snarskis, it comprises mostly flesh-colored, self-slipped cera- mics, while there are smaller quantities (&lt;5%) of red-rimmed-on-cream ware. More than 40% of the 700-odd rims have comma-shaped "tecomate" forms, with interior thickening. Also present are perfectly flat, rimmed plates (which would be called "budares" for the preparation of manioc bread in South America), as well as other forms of pans and dishes which Snarskis likens to the Saladoid and other early Colombian and Venezuelan pottery series. When compared with later Costa Rican cera- mic complexes that date from the Zoned Bichromes onwards, about 90% of the La Montafia modes would seem to be idiosyncratic; in fact, Snarskis ventures the idea that they resemble most closely the Barlovento series from Colombia, especially as re- gards their decoration: zoned red slip; broad line in- cising; excision filled with red pigment; cord mark- ing; shell stamping; round and oval punctation; and appliqu6 pellets and fillets. Another series of Formative sites has recently been located by Snarskis in the Pital (San Carlos) area of north-central Costa Rica. No C-14 dates are available yet, but a span of 1500-800 B.C. has been suggested for the ceramics recovered here, which show some resemblances to and also some differ- ences from the La Montaia complex. "Tecomates" comprise over 60% of the 150-rim sample; there are no "budares," but pans and dishes with an expanded interior lip, like those of La Montana, are present; the self-slipped La Montafia ware is absent; most sherds have a zoned red slip, delimited by broad cir- cumferential incising on a polished natural surface; and there is some red-pigment-filled black ware. Snarskis feels that this complex, as a unit, bears close resemblances to the Oc6s/Cuadros materials from Guatemala, especially as regards the abun- dance of cord marking and shell stamping. The National Museum of Costa Rica continued a third season's work at the extensive Vidor site on the Bay of Culebra (Pacific coast). Frederick Lange di- rected the project. He was assisted by Suzanne Abel (Brown University), Richard Accola (University of Texas), David Bernstein (Brown University), and 520 [Vol. 43, No. 3,1978]</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT RESEARCH Jean-Francois Moreau (Universite de Montreal). This year's project was aided by a grant from the National Geographic Society. Excavations focused on the earlier levels at the site and confirmed last year's stratigraphic separa- tion of at least two components in the Zoned Bichrome period (see "Current Research" 42(2):281). An extensive habitation-cum-cemetery complex was also excavated. This proved to be predominantly Ear- ly Polychrome (A.D. 500-800) in date, containing, al- most exclusively, the remains of infants and females buried in a variety of ways: in inverted jars, in the open, flexed and extended. A number of interments of adults, which included several heads, and numerous concentrations of disarticulated human bones were also discovered. A total of more than 60 complete or partial individuals were recovered dur- ing the season. At the same site, two circular adobe and stone rings were found, one probably associated with the Zoned Bichrome and the other with the Early Poly- chrome periods. Though Lange refers to these as "ovens," he stresses that their precise function re- mains to be determined. Other features included a number of adobe floors, rock concentrations, rows of post-holes and garbage pits full of shells and other animal remains. Incorporated in the stratigraphic profiles of the excavations and visible in road work- ings in the surrounding area were 3 separate layers of volcanic ash. It can be assumed that natural events must have affected the patterns of human set- tlement in this area. Excavations were also undertaken at the Ruiz site, near the Bay of Culebra, where a lost-wa- gold mold was recovered in 1976 ("Current Research" 42(2): 282). The supervisor in the field was Deborah Swartz (University of Arizona). Students from the Associated Colleges of the Midwest also participated. The work was supported, in part, by the National Geographic Society. The indications of last year's small tests, that this is a predominantly Late Polychrome site, were confirmed by more extensive excavations. A number of large horizontal areas were stripped in at- tempts to locate different activity areas, without suc- cess. Salvage operations in a badly pot-hunted cemetery were also unfruitful. An intensive survey was conducted by W. O. Finch at the Hacienda Jerico on the edge of the Tenorio volcano. This marked the initial step of a study designed to define the nature of the prehistoric rela- tionships between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the country. Extensive habitation and mortuary sites were located, dating mostly to the Early Polychrome period (A.D. 500-800). Oscar M. Fonseca Z. (Laboratorio de Arqueologia de la Universidad de Costa Rica) reports on the "Pro- yecto Secuencias Culturales en el Intermontano Cen- tral," which he codirects with Carlos Aguilar P. At the moment, materials from the Pavas phase (330 B.C.-A.D. 400) are being analyzed in an attempt to define typological and chronological changes in the ceramics, especially as regards the transitional period which links the Pavas and Curridabat phases (A.D. 400-850). The changes that have been dis- cerned so far would seem to represent a slow, endemic evolution of modes from one phase to the other. Materials have been recovered from 20 sites, of which the following have been excavated: Aurora, El Berral, Cbrdoba, Valldeperas, Alvarado and Tatisci (the last three were reported in "Current Research" 42(2):282). A subproject of the above, labeled "Arqueologia Ecol6gica del Intermontano Central" is dedicated to the recovery of organic materials that will throw light on the subsistence strategies of the area. So far 4 sites have been located with good qualities for preservation. Wood, seeds, and other organic ma- terials from the Cedros site are under analysis at the Biology Faculty of the University. The Descanso site excavations recovered 4 maize cobs associated with ceramics of the Cartago phase (A.D. 850-1500), which have been identified by Hugh Cutler (Missouri Botanical Garden) as belonging to the group of an- cient races that include Nal-Tel and Chapalote and other forms related to the South American Polio. William J. Kennedy (Florida Atlantic) continues analyzing materials from his Torito site (Reventaz6n), reported last year. He confirms that this is a one- component dwelling deposit coeval with and cultural- ly similar to Snarskis' Linea Vieja sites of the El Bos- que Complex (300 B.C.-A.D. 400). Donald R. Melton and Anita K. Myketuk (Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones Cientificos) located, map- ped, and described 7 prehistoric intertidally op- erated traps along the central Pacific coast. These consist of stone walls from 25 to 70 m in diameter; they are completely flooded during the neaps and on- ly exposed to view during the lower 20% of the spring tides. This would suggest that they were sup- plemented above the stones with some form of per- ishable structure, such as a pole trellis or nets. Their construction seems to have obeyed certain en- vironmental prerequisites: all were erected in prox- imity to rocky outcrops, sandy pocket beaches, and fresh water. The fact that all the fresh water sources dry out during the dry season implies that the traps were employed only during the rains. (This may ex- plain why Vasquez de Coronado, who visited this area in the dry season of 1563, fails to mention any traps). The investigators suggest they were used for turtles, of which the Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) is the most likely contender. The females leave the sea at high flood and when returning with the ebb, would have been trapped on the shoreward side by the crescent-shaped barriers. The males might well have been caught while waiting for the females: they are known to linger around or sleep under rocks near beaches prior to their trysts. PANAMA. Since December 1976, Robert Drolet (Illinois) has been conducting an intensive ar- chaeological survey of the "Costa Arriba" on the Carribbean slopes (Col6n Province). He has already located 25 sites (discounting historic black set- tlements). These he has provisionally divided into three major groups: 1 site is Spanish colonial, 8 are black cimaroon camps, and 16 are indigenous set- tlements. The indigenous sites have ceramics that 521</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY bear resemblances to materials dated from about A.D. 700-1500 in the Bayano valley and other areas of eastern Pacific Panama. An earlier, possibly For- mative population may also be represented, whose ceramics would include "tecomate" and "budare"-like forms. The black cimaroon camps, which date after 1509, contain both indigenous ("Santa Isabel") wares and Colonial types ("Costeno Cream Ware"); the latter have counterparts in col- lections made by Jose Cruxent in Darien and San Bias. Drolet hopes to investigate more thoroughly what he believes to have been a complex symbiotic relationship between the native and cimaroon groups of the immediately postcontact period. Test excava- tions are planned for the 1978 dry season, while the survey will be expanded in order to assess more com- pletely the differences in settlement patterns and subsistence between the three categories of sites in their various temporal stages. In Cocld (Central Region), Richard G. Cooke (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) continues the analysis of materials from Sitio Sierra. The relative dates of A.D. 150-500 that have been as- signed to the pristine deposits and their Aristide bichrome, Tonosi trichrome and heterogeneous, plastically decorated wares will have to be revised in the face of 4 new C-14 determinations: 2190?80 radiocarbon years: 240 B.C. (1-9704), for the earliest burials of a family cemetery at the base of the site; 2015?80 radiocarbon years: 65 B.C. (1-9702) and 1975 ?80 radiocarbon years: 25 B.C. (1-9703) for, respectively, the central hearth and associated rub- bish pile of a small structure located above the cemetery; and 1835 + 90 radiocarbon years: A.D. 115 (1-9701) for another domestic structure at a higher level and in a different part of the site. Though this series, which was analyzed as a unit, is internally consistent, it contradicts earlier dates from the same cuts by about 150 years. If these determinations are more "correct" than the others, Period IV of the Cen- tral Region sequence should be recalculated as span- ning 300 B.C.-A.D. 500. There are some new interim results of faunal and floral analyses from this same period at Sitio Sierra. Storrs Olson (National Museum of Natural History) has identified 8 definite and 11 probable bird genera, most to species level, from part of a single rubbish dump; some of these (cf. Cassidix mexicanus, cf. Muscivora tyrannus and Colinus cristatus) are open- country birds whose ecological preferences cor- roborate those of the mammalian fauna already analyzed. It seems that by the beginning of Sitio Sierra's occupation (ca. 300 B.C?), there was little tall forest close to the village. Elizabeth Wing (University of Florida Museum) has so far identified 35 genera of fish from a single rubbish pile. John Lynch (University of Nebraska) reports that most of the 500-odd anuran elements are Bufo marinus (thereby resuscitating Furstian ideas of their use?). C. Earle Smith has classified all the carbonized plant remains as Zea mays, except for a solitary Phaseolus vulgaris. A large offering of carbonized maize was found at the side of one of the burials in the basal cemetery, so it is likely that maize was already under cultivation in the area by at least 300 B.C. Though Smith's analysis is still in a preliminary stage, he thinks that two varieties of corn are represented by the sample of kernels and cobs: "Pollo-like" and "Nal-Tel/Chapalote-like," while a third, "Harina de Ocho/Cuzco-like," is evident from the kernels alone. Antony J. Ranere (Temple University) has received a batch of 7 new C-14 readings for his 1975 excava- tions at Monagrillo (Herrera). In Block 1, these are, in stratigraphic order: 4405 ?75 radiocarbon years: 2455 B.C. (SI-2842) (thin ash lense, 20-30 cm below surface); 3245 + 100 radiocarbon years: 1295 B.C. (SI-2843) (hearth, 50-56 cm below surface, small sample); 4135?80 radiocarbon years: 2185 B.C. (SI-2844) (ash lense, 97-100 cm below surface). Also from Block 1 is a date reported in "Current Research" 42(2):283 as 3325 ? 85 radiocarbon years: 1375 B.C. (1-9384) (charcoal from a 1 m2 portion of an occupation zone or living surface at 150-160 cm below surface). In Block 2, the following readings were obtained: 3385 ?75 radiocarbon years: 1435 B.C. (SI-2838) (scattered charcoal from 20-30 cm below surface); 3485 ? 100 radiocarbon years: 1535 B.C. (SI-2389) (scattered charcoal, 50-60 cm below surface); 3615 80 radiocarbon years: 1665 B.C. (SI-2840) (associated with a living floor, 95-100 cm below surface); and 5385 75 radiocarbon years: 3435 B.C. (SI-2841) (scattered charcoal, 110-120 cm below surface). Ranere's feelings about the interpretation of these dates are that those in Block 1 reflect the extremely complicated stratigraphy, which included several in- tercutting pits and other features. For this reason, it is possible that no undisturbed carbon was recov- ered. Nevertheless, at a 1-sigma uncalibrated level, the whole series from this cut falls within a 1300-year period (ca. 2500-ca. 1200 B.C.), which Ranere thinks is a reasonable estimate for the dura- tion of the "Monagrillo Phase." The first three dates from Block 2 are in a logical sequence and can be ac- cepted. However, the lowest date of 3425 B.C. seems to be unreasonably early. Olga Linares (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) is finishing the final report on her Chiriqui- Bocas del Toro project: "Adaptive Strategies in the New World Tropics: A Prehistoric Example from Pa- nama," which will be a landmark in the archaeology of Lower Central America as the first published multidisciplinary study of problem-solving ilk. Catherine Shelton Einhaus (Temple University) has completed a master's thesis: "A Technological and Functional Analysis of Stone Tools from Isla Palen- que, Panama." Richard G. Cooke has prepared two Environmental Impact Statements for Panamanian Government pro- jects in Chiriqui: the Fortuna Dam Project and the Cerro Colorado Mine Project. Richard G. Cooke NORTHWESTERN SOUTH AMERICA COLOMBIA. Gilberto Cadavid and Luisa Fernanda de Turbay (Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia) are 522 [Vol. 43, No. 3,1978]</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT RESEARCH continuing an archaeological research program in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Their object is to develop a picture of the indigenous populations at the time of the Spanish Conquest, to validate the reports of the earliest Chronicleers, and to better understand the cultural developments which took place in the Sierra Nevada. To date they have located 211 ar- chaeological sites, principally on the western and northern slopes of the Sierra Nevada. These sites have been classified according to the kinds of houses, walls, and streets found in them. At 183 sites ar- chitecture is limited to simple circular houses made of unworked stones, and the streets are characteriz- ed by simple lines of unworked stones. Elaborate pav- ed roads were identified at just 6 sites, worked stone walls in just 4, and elaborate houses in 6 sites. Maria Victoria Uribe (Instituto Colombiano de An- tropologia) is excavating grave sites in the Depart- ment of Narinio, which borders on Carchi Province of Ecuador. In recent years a new goldworking style has been identified in this area. Uribe reports that the Narifno graves can be identified with the stylistic periods established by Alice Francisco for Carchi and that the two radiocarbon dates confirm Fran- cisco's ordering of the data. One Capuli style grave produced two hollow figurines with head deforma- tions reminiscent of the Pacific Coast. From another Capuli grave came a distinctive stone axe of the style which Jij6n y Caamano recovered from a shaft grave at the San Buenaventura site in Imbabura. Like Fran- cisco, Uribe has found transitional Piartal/Tuza Style graves but not Capuli/Piartal. ECUADOR. Beginning in 1974 the Centro de In- vestigaciones Arqueologicas de la Pontifica Univer- sidad Catolica del Ecuador, directed by Pedro I. Por- ras, began a search for Formative period sites in the central highlands, both on the eastern and western flanks of the cordillera as well as in the highland basins. Five Formative localities were identified, in- cluding the Cotocollao site in a northern suburb of Quito. Excavations at Cotocollao were begun in late 1974 and continued to June, 1976. Cultural deposits reached a depth of 1.20 m. The settlement, which measured 150 x 80 m, had been built at the base of a V-shaped valley, which descended Mt. Pichincha to the shores of an ancient lake. No indications of houses or other structures were identified. The For- mative occupation was partially destroyed by great floods, which are indicated by a bed of rounded stones, sand mixed with human bones, and skeletons in anatomical disorder. The association of bones and artifacts might lead one to the erroneous conclusion that there had been funerary offerings. Most of the associated pottery was thin and com- pact with a sand temper. Vessel forms include wide- mouthed globular ollas, with or without handles; spout and bridge bottles similar to those of the Machalilla and Chorrera Phases of the Coast; and deep bowls with almost vertical walls. These bowls are decorated on the exterior with red bands, hachure, zoned incisions, line polishing, comb bur- nish, grooves, punctations, fingernail marks, and shoulders decorated with notched fillets. Stone mor- tars, probably andesite, reproduce the forms and decoration of pottery vessels, including incisions, grooves, and zoned incisions. The site was reoccupied during the latter part of the Regional Development and Integration periods. Among the surface finds were sherds of the Chaup- icruz, Panzaleo, and Inca phases. Later in 1976, Emil Peterson (Museo del Banco Central) continued work at the Cotocollao site, which is located in a zone of intensive urban development. Excavations were concentrated in the soon-to-be- destroyed upper part of the site, which is presumably later. A cemetery and a complex housing group have been revealed. Peterson found that house groups dating to 3495+ 210 radiocarbon years: 1545 B.C. (GX-4768) were clustered on the banks of small streams leading into the lake. Individual houses were large, square- cornered structures made of closely spaced posts, which had been set vertically into prepared earthen terraces. Each house contained several rooms sep- arated by what appears to be reed matting. Recon- struction on abandoned house platforms created a 2-m midden over a period of about 1000 years. Car- bonized maize and beans were excavated from house pits along with the bones of deer, rabbit, and water- fowl. Early Cotocollao pottery is reminiscent of Machalilla and Chorrera phase vessels in form and decoration. Vessel forms include single spout bottles, stirrup spout bottles, flat bottom bowls and annular ring bases. Decorative techniques include red band painting, cross-hatch incision, red band incision, and punctation. Less common wares can be traced to For- mative period sites of southern Ecuador and Peru. Late Cotocollao pottery is distinguished by the in- troduction of a smudge bottle with a single spout at- tached to the body by a ventilated bridge handle. Lithic material includes superbly crafted stone bowls and obsidian flakes. The cemetery part of the site is dominated by a mass burial, which dates to 2485 + 130 radiocarbon years: 535 B.C. (GX-4762). It produced 150 skeletons that had been heaped in a large pile. Primary, secondary, and basket burials were included. Many of the dead had been dismembered and bound at the wrists and ankles before burial. Most of the dead were adults, some with artificially deformed skulls. Grave goods include personal jewelry, trophy heads, stone balls, and ceramic vessels. Directly beneath the mass burials were 5 tombs that had been cut vertically into the hardpan for a depth of 40 cm. They date to 3135 + 165 radiocarbon years: 1185 B.C. (GX-4766). Each tomb contained a single tightly flexed adult burial surrounded by large stones. Shortly after the mass burial a local volcano erupted and buried the site about 500 B.C. In 1974, Emil Peterson (Peace Corps, Museo del Banco Central) began a survey of endangered ar- chaeological sites around Quito. The valley was divided into 8 units defined by lateral ecological zones. After surveying and collecting 55 sites in ran- domly selected units, 6 sites were chosen for excava- tion based upon their anticipated destruction date 523</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY and the relevant data they would yield. To date, 4 of the sites have been excavated and radiocarbon dated. Three cultural periods have been tentatively defined on the basis of settlement pattern, population shifts, and associated ceramics. The earliest period is represented by a small undated site characterized by carinated bowls and red band painting that is similar to the early Cotocollao material. The second period sees an increase of individual house sites in the 2500-3000 m band. It is characterized by Chorrera-like spouted bottles and punctate decora- tion. The two excavated sites from this time period have produced radiocarbon dates of 2945 95 radiocarbon years: 995 B.C. (UW-368) and 1810 90 radiocarbon years: A.D. 140 (UW-374). Sites of the late period are most common. Typically they are house clusters or hamlets grouped about the playas of the now dry Lake Quito. Two sites excavated from this period have produced dates of 875 ? 90 radiocar- bon years: A.D. 1085 (UW-369) and 865 100 radiocarbon years: A.D. 1095 (UW-375). The pottery is characterized by tripod cooking vessels, compotera bowls and very little decoration. An increase in direct trade goods from the Bahia and La Tolita phases of the Ecuadorian coast is witnessed, as well as an influx of goods from the Chimborazo area to the south and the Imbabura area to the north. With the cooperation of federal and private agen- cies, the Museo del Banco Central has sponsored the formation of an archaeological team to investigate the 2.4 archaeological sites that are destroyed week- ly in the Quito area. Investigations of the Instituto Otavalefio de An- tropologia continue with the salvage of several tombs that have produced groups of associated vessels use- ful for the development of a more detailed regional ceramic chronology. Fernando Plaza (IOA) continues his investigation of pucaras (fortresses). To date, 37 pucaras have been identified, all associated with pot- tery of the Integration period. Salvage excavations at Rumicucho Pucara in San Antonio de Pichincha have produced a small amount of Imperial Inca pottery and larger quantities of regional Inca ceramics, including arybaloids, plates, and typical handles in addition to Integration Period pottery, which is typical of Imbabura and northern Pichincha. Remains of llama, guinea pig, maize, and peanuts have also been recovered. Investigations in 1976 in Imbabura Province by J. S. Athens (University of New Mexico) primarily fo- cused on problems of intrasite settlement pattern at the large mound sites. The testing of 6 mounds at the Socapamba site, different in size and morphology, in- dicated striking similarities in floor features and ar- tifact types. A domestic function is implied. Radiocarbon dates for several of the mounds and pot- tery analysis demonstrate that they all pertain to the Late period (post 1250 A.D.). A systematic surface survey documented very light artifact density throughout the 1.2-km2 Socapamba site. There was no discernable variability in artifact types or fre- quencies in the survey. Supplemental investigations at other mound sites provided similar results. Ac- cumulating dating evidence seems to indicate that quadrilateral ramp mounds were all built in the Late period. Linda Goff (Washington U.) has analyzed ceramics from the stratified La Chimba site in northern Pichin- cha. The earliest phase is characterized by punctate designs placed directly below deep flat bowl rims. The second is marked by diagonal and chevron in- cised bowls in combination with a zoned white slip and applique buttons on carinated bowls. The last phase is characterized by a red line resist ware. In all three phases, red slip decoration and interior or exterior burnishing are common. Vessel forms from La Chimba include both deep and shallow carinated bowls; small, thin-walled ollas and jars; bridge and spout jars; and large "tola-like" jars with wide apertures. Other ceramic wares in- clude coca-chewing figurines, rectangular recep- tacles, spindle whorls, and diagnostic nonlocal trade ware. Two preliminary radiocarbon samples give dates of about 150 B.C. and A.D. 730. The second date has been questioned because of small sample size. Ceramics similar to La Chimba have been found as far north as Socopamba in northern Imbabura. Al- though the La Chimba styles have some similarities with other highland styles, the majority of the ceramics from Imbabura and northern Pichincha are quite different from contemporary styles in the highlands and on the coast. In 1976, Daniel Schavelzon (Museo del Banco Cen- tral) directed salvage excavations at the Jaramij6 site in Manabi. It is a large town with stone foundations, stairways, and roads. Structure A-1 of Mound 1 showed 5 superimposed building phases, the largest and uppermost foundations measuring 63.5 x 25.5 m. Most of the remains pertain to the Mantefio culture, possibly with an earlier occupation of the Bahia culture. In early 1977, Schavelzon conducted excavations at the Terrazas site, near Manta. The Mantefio culture site is located on a low hill covered with agricultural terraces and with stone foundations on the upper part of the hill. The foundation of Mound 1 measured 34.5 x 13.5 m with many inner walls and an inclined ramp without superpositions. Many metates, polished stone objects and flakes were recovered. Thomas P. Myers ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA PERU. James B. Richardson III (University of Pitts- burg) located several hundred sites and mound groups in the Upper Piura Valley from Tambogrande to Morropon, in a survey aimed at the determination of Vicus-period settlement patterns and economics. Some 50 sites can be placed in the Vicus or pre-Vicus period, the remainder being Chimu, Inca, or historic. Pre-Vicus (Encantada phase) sites are located in zones not suitable for cultivation at the valley edge and on the floodplain; 6 pyramids and several village sites are known, with pottery similar to wares from a 524 [Vol. 43, No. 3,1978]</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT RESEARCH coastal site at Colan, near Paita, thought to date about 800 B.C. The Vicus phase is represented by numerous ceme- teries, several villages and 2 pyramids-one quite large, with remnants of rectangular adobe walls. Although no Moche spout forms were found, Vicus ceramics ex- hibit relationships to Moche types to the south as well as with other northern and highland complexes. The Chimu occupation terminates the Vicus culture and is extensive on the floodplain and along the periphery of the Piura River. Pyramid centers, villages, and cemeteries were found in addition to 2 heavily for- tified hilltops. Michael Moseley (Field Museum) and James Kus are investigating the field and irrigation systems of the Moche Valley, especially in the Pampas Esperan- za and Huanchaco areas, in collaboration with specialists in soils, pollen, and hydrology. They mapped small settlements along the canals and in the immediate vicinity of fields. Beyond the reconstruc- tion of irrigation technology, they hope to relate public constructions to Chimu methods of socio- political control of labor and resource management. Alexandra Klymyshyn (Wichita State University) has finished her study of Chan Chan architecture and squatter settlements. With support from the Guggenheim Foundation, Duccio Bonavia (Universidad Cayetano Heredia) re- cently surveyed the Huarmey Valley from its head- waters to the mouth, finding over 100 sites dating from preceramic to Late Horizon times. However, the project centered upon the redigging of Los Gavilanes (PV35-1) and the study of its preceramic maize, which Bonavia has just completed at the Botany Museum, Harvard University. New stratigraphic pro- files at Los Gavilanes prove the preceramic date of the constructions brought to light in the 1960 and 1974 campaigns. They have now been studied in de- tail, as has a new structure nearby, which seems to have been designed for the storage of maize. At Bermejo, 11 km north of the Fortaleza Para- monga, Jorge Silva (Universidad de San Marcos) in- vestigated coastal Chavin influence in circular ceremonial structures, household architecture, and the local economy. After a semester studying lithic analysis at Cornell, Silva turned to an examination of Andean musical instruments, looking at their social function, as seen through ethnography and the Chronicles, as well as their archaeological occur- rence. James Vreeland (University of Texas, Austin) returned to the National Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology in 1977 for the concluding phase of research on prehispanic mortuary practices of the central coast. Collaborating again with his col- leagues in the departments of textiles and physical anthropology, he focused his studies on Middle Horizon mummy bundles. During this phase major transformations of mortuary patterns occurred, as evidenced by the widespread appearance of bundles constructed with distinct anthropomorphic con- figuration. Ramiro Matos Mendieta (Universidad de San Mar- cos) and Jeffrey R. Parsons (University of Michigan) are engaged in a long-term study of Prehispanic set- tlement patterns in the Upper Mantaro Valley. Two seasons of regional survey produced a complete sam- ple of occupation by ceramic-using populations within an area of about 1000 km2 between Concep- ci6n and Lake Junin, with eastward extensions into the Tarma-Huasahuasi region. The field work sug- gests (a) very limited occupation prior to the last phase of the Early Intermediate period; (b) significant population growth and settlement expansion after about A.D. 400; (c) major population expansion and cultural florescence after A.D. 1000, with the first in- tegration of specialized puna herders and valley agri- culturalists in 2 stylistically well defined spatial units corresponding with the historically defined Huanca and Tarma polities; and (d) a superficial overlay of Inca authority that had only minimal impact on the location and behavior of local populations. In 1977 William Isbell (SUNY, Binghamton) began a 6-year investigation of the process of city and state formation at Huari. During the first season Isbell con- centrated on (a) defining the boundaries of Huari and its immediate satellite communities through surface survey of the urban periphery and adjacent area; (b) establishing a more refined ceramic seriation to dif- ferentiate temporal from synchronic sociocultural variation by combining qualitative and quantitative analysis of surface collections with samples from stratified refuse and contrastive building excava- tions; and (c) establishing preliminary indices of rela- tionship between surface and subsurface remains by supplementing surface data and judgment excava- tions with small-scale probability sampling in 4 ar- chitecturally segregated sectors of Huari. The Instituto Nacional de Cultura continues its work at Pucara in the Department of Puno. In addi- tion to reconstruction and stabilization, there have been new excavations led by Elias Mujica and Ernesto Nakandakari, especially at the "white and red temple" first identified in 1939 by Kidder in the upper part of the Qalasaya pyramid. Nakandakari identified an earlier occupation and hopes to estab- lish a chronological key for the site. The reoccupation in Inca and Colonial times has also been clarified. Although they have yet to excavate Inca houses, and the extent and nature of the late settlement is still unclear, a great stairway of fine Inca masonry is now shown to have ascended to the upper part of the Qalasaya pyramid. During the latter part of the year Mujica and Idilio Santallana (INC), who has com- pleted a survey of Inca terracing in the Urubamba Valley, took advantage of Fulbright grants to travel to the U.S. and study at Cornell University. Rolando Paredes and Mario Niufiez (INC) are mak- ing an inventory of the archaeological resources of the Department of Puno. The first task to be faced was the rescue of the evidence of Tiwanaku occupa- tion remaining on Esteves Island, after the destruc- tion of much of the site by construction of a tourist hotel. Unfortunately much information has been lost on the first Tiwanaku occupation known on the west side of Lake Titicaca. CHILE. Guillermo Focacci, Ivan Mufioz, and Calogero Santoro (Universidad del Norte, Arica) 525</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY have undertaken a comprehensive study of an Incaic settlement in the Alto Ramirez sector of the Azapa Valley. They excavated a number of rectangular reed houses grouped around a single example built of stone, the latter constructed in the manner of stone fortifications of the area. Analysis of household refuse demonstrates distinct use-zones within the structures and a mixed economy based on agricul- tural, pastoral, and maritime resources. Focacci's team is also investigating the corrals, field systems, storage facilities, cemetery, and petroglyphs associated with the site. With Juan Munizaga (Universidad de Chile, Santiago) Santoro is studying the early "cuneiform" type of cranial deformation, dating about 1100 to 800 B.C., found at site AZ-14 on the Pampa Alto Ramirez. Excavations also continue at several previously known sites dating to the Alto Ramirez phase and time of Tiwanaku influence. Jorge Hildalgo is on leave studying historical sources at Cornell. Percy Dauelsberg (Arica) established the contem- poraneity of the shell and thorn fishhook traditions at a shell midden on the north bank of the Rio Cama- rones, near its outlet to the sea. Hans Niemeyer and Virgilio Schiappacasse (Santiago) continue their work on the south bank, complementing their earlier work on sites of the Conanoxa culture further east in the quebrada. At Punta de Teatinos, 10 km north of La Serena, they have excavated over 100 burials, which are undergoing anatomical analysis by Silvia Quevedo (Universidad de Chile, Santiago). Niemeyer is also excavating settlements of the Inca period in the Iglesia Colorado region, on the Rio Pulido, one of tributaries of the Rio Copiap6. These lie at the foot of the Inca fortress mentioned by Ger6nimo de Bibar in the 16th century. At the 7th Congress on Chilean Archaeology in Talca, Agustin Llagostera (Universidad del Norte, Antofagasta) released a date of 9400 ? 160 radiocar- bon years: 7450 B.C. (P-2702) on a hearth at the bot- tom of a coastal site, Quebrada Las Conchas, near Antofagasta. Llagostera has identified over 5,000 fish otoliths, including those of seven species now locally extinct. Warmth-loving species become pro- gressively more common in the upper layers of the site, which are also characterized by geometric or cogged stones much like those found in Archaic mid- dens on the coast of California. Although there is no direct evidence for the use of nets in fishing, some stones may be net weights; some of the fish repre- sented in the midden (e.g., Cynoscion) are impractical to catch on hooks. George Serracino and Gustave LePaige excavated several preceramic huts at Calarcoco (Aguas Blan- cas, near Toconao) and removed an intact burial to the Museo Arqueol6gico de San Pedro de Atacama. The skull is reported to show special morphologically primitive features. Serracino has established an ethnobotanical garden at the museum and is also cooperating with the United Nations nuclear energy center in Santiago, which is experimenting with a system of dating plants through fractionation of car- bon isotopes and residues of past water systems. Thomas Lynch (Cornell University) mapped and began excavation of a site, in the San Pedro or Rio Grande Valley, which has been known as Catarpe Tambo since Mostny's visit 2 generations ago. Ex- cellent preservation of everything from roofing materials to household debris promises to amplify our understanding of life at an Inca military and ad- ministrative outpost. Lautaro Nifiez A. (Universidad del Norte, An- tofagasta) continues his excavation of a preceramic settlement on the south rim of the Quebrada Tulan, where he has also identified an early agricultural aspect. Under the auspices of the Paleo-Indian Pro- gram of the Smithsonian Institution, he continues the work initiated by Julio Montan6 and Rafil Baha- mondes at Quereo, a kill and butchering site near Los Vilos. Some of the horse bones show modification for use as tools, radiocarbon dates of around 9,000 years have been obtained, and Nifiez is making extensive lateral exposures of the occupation surfaces. Gast6n Castillo (Museo de Capiap6) and Arturo Rodriguez (Museo de La Serena) have described a preceramic culture at La Fundici6n in the upper part of the Quebrada El Durazno, a site previously worked by Jorge Iribarren Charlin, former director of the Museo de La Serena. It is my sad obligation to report the death of this great man, friend, and dean of Chilean archaeology, whose heart failed him just before dawn on Sunday, January 16, 1977. After a move to La Serena, Mario Rivera has re- sumed his work in the Norte Chico, where he will turn to the investigation of various rockshelters after completing his synthesis of cultural development on the altiplano and Tiwanaku influence in the southern Andes. Gonzalo Ampuero (Ovalle and La Serena) dis- covered a crude industry of exhausted cores and chopping tools near Pachingo in the Limari region. Jacqueline Madrid de Colin (Universidad de Chile, Santiago) has defined a Central Valley culture, with Diaguita influence, on the basis of numerous tumulus burials in the Aconcagua Valley. Osvaldo Silva, of the same institution, is studying Precolumbian irriga- tion and cultivation in the field and through docu- ments he has discovered in the National Historical Archives. Julia Monle6n undertook salvage excava- tions in the Parque La Quintrala, Comuna de La Reina, Santiago. South of Constituci6n, in the old province of Maule, Alberto Medina and Ciro Vergara investigated a lith- ic industry, probably preceramic, at Las Canias. Am6rico Gordon reports an Araucanian cemetery at Padre Las Casas, Cautin province, where urns and funeral canoes were found in double burials. Omar Ortiz-Troncoso (Instituut voor Prae- en Protohistorie, Amsterdam) has 2 new radiocarbon dates on the low- est level of the previously published midden at Bahia Buena on the Brunswick Peninsula of the Strait of Magellan: 5895 65 radiocarbon years (GrN-7614) and 5770+1110 (GrN-7613). The Punta Santa Ana midden has an additional determination of 6410 + 70 radiocarbon years (GrN-7612). Thomas F. Lynch 526 [Vol. 43, No. 3,1978]</page><page sequence="18">CURRENT RESEARCH AMAZON BASIN AND EASTERN BRAZIL ECUADOR. During July of 1976 the Anglo-Ecua- dorian Los Tayos Expedition, organized by officers of the British Army and the University of Edinburgh, conducted a multidisciplinary investigation of the up- per Santiago and Los Tayos (oil birds) Cave in the province of Morona-Santiago. Preseley Norton (Program for New World Anthropology, Inc.) sur- veyed and tested an extensive site in the vicinity of the Salesian mission at Santiago. Radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dates from the site cluster at 1000 A.D. A brief survey of the area from the mission to the Coangos river showed that the upper Santiago has been quite densely populated at various times. Pedro I. Porras (Universidad Cat6lica del Ecuador) reports a number of sites on the Santiago river near the confluence of the Yaupi with ceramics that are similar in technique and design to the pottery of Napo. Porras also reports having found a Napo-style site, Lomon-Concha, a few kilometers from the con- fluence of the Coca with the Napo. He recognizes the similarity between this Napo-like pottery and the pot- tery of the Caimito tradition of Eastern Peru, Mira- conguera tradition of Brazil, and finally with Mara- joara ceramics from the mouth of the Amazon. The wide expanse of these traditions can only relate to a people highly oriented towards the rivers for transportation and subsistence. The editor of this report cannot resist restating here that Donald W. Lathrap (University of Illionis) and his students have demonstrated that the distribution of these poly- chrome and broad line incised wares relate to the Upper Amazonian Tupian-speaking tribes. In the Cordillera de el C6ndor on the right shore of the Guangos river the Los Tayos Cave was explored by members of the expedition and found to be the largest cave so far surveyed in South America. Within the cave, biologist David Campbell discovered a cache of ceremonial pottery and spondylus and pearl shell ornaments. Pedro I. Porras and a group of his students excavated the cache. Pottery and shell artifacts were found to be associated with T-shaped axes and appear to have been part of the grave goods of an important person. The shell ornaments repre- sent stylized teeth of mammals, two-headed serpents, birds and felines. The ceramic artifacts are styl- istically of the Formative and include red polished, red on buff, black polished, incised, and zoned punc- tate decorative wares. Forms include bottles with handles and anthropomorphic spouts, bottles with high spouts, and globular jars with human heads modeled on the shoulders. Porras believes that this material is stylistically affiliated with Machalilla of coastal Ecuador, Cerro Narrio I of Cafiar and Azuay, and especially with Tutishcainyo and the Cave of the Owls of Eastern Peru. J. S. Athens and Pita Kelekna (University of New Mexico) tested a stratified Pastaza phase site near the Achuara Jivaro village of Pumpuentsa on the Rio Macuma in Morona Santiago Province. A radiocar- bon date of 1210+65 radiocarbon years: A.D. 740 (DIC 798) was obtained. This date falls midway be- tween radiocarbon dates that Porras has obtained for the Pastaza Phase. Elsewhere in the region, at Yaupi Cave, while studying the bat population, Robert Stebbins found a blackware vessel of unidentified affiliation, which he turned over to the Central Bank Museum in Quito. VENEZUELA. In 1976 Adam Garson (Yale Univer- sity) conducted a survey and excavations at La Calzada in the Pedraza District of Barinas in the western ilanos. Eleven mound sites and an equal number of nonmound sites of the Osoid ceramic series were surveyed. Five of the largest mound clusters were interconnected by a network of cause- ways, and several nonmound sites may have been satellite settlements. A site hierarchy was con- structed, grouping settlement by the number, size, and whether the mounds consisted of habitational refuse or were artificially constructed. Faunal re- mains indicate a heavy emphasis on riverine re- sources. In a gallery forest habitat at the edge of the Ilanos 13, sites or sherd scatters of the Arauquinoid, Canlo Caroni complex were located. One dual- component site with both Osoid and Arauquinoid materials yielded carbonized maize, beans, and palm fruit. The Osoid sites are estimated to date within the first millenia A.D., while the Arauquinoid sites are estimated to embrace the period from the end of the first millenia A.D. to the colonial period. BRAZIL. 1976 marked the initiation of an Amazo- nian research project modeled after the PRONAPA program. Sponsors of the Programa Nacional de Pes- quisas Arqueol6gicas na Bacie Amazonica (PRONAPABA) include the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnolbgico, Instituto de Patrim6nio Histbrico e Artistico Nacional, In- stituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia, and the Smithsonian Institution. The newly organized coop- erative project is to have a duration of 3 to 5 years and is directed by Clifford Evans and Betty J. Meg- gers of the Smithsonian and Mario F. Sim6es of the Museu Emilio Goeldi. Special attention will be directed towards research along the principle trib- utaries and the right margin of the Amazon. The ob- jective of the research is to test the forest refuge model and its applicability to human populations. For an explanation of the model see World Archaeology, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 287-303. The hypothesis is based upon biogeographical data that have been inter- preted as evidence for post-Pleistocene climatic change resulting in breaking up and coalescing of the humid tropical forest. It is theorized that the savan- nah corridors permitted men to enter the Amazon Basin, and with the coalescing of the corridors diverse groups were entrapped. Research will be directed toward further revealing the antiquity of culture adapted to the tropical forest and tracing the continuity or discontinuity of regional cultures. The editor of this report hopes that the initial reports of this research will be more descriptive and less clas- sificatory than the reports of the previous PRONAPA program. It would be a great improvement if rim 527</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY forms, vessel forms, and designs were discussed as well as surface treatment and temper. Para. In July and August of 1976 Eneida Ch. Maler- bi (Museu Emilio Goeldi) initiated the PRONAPABA program with research on the lower Tocantins be- tween the city of Maraba and the village of Santa Terezinha do Tauari, where a hydroelectric dam is being constructed. Of the many sites identified, 8 were tested. All of these occupy high areas along the margin of the river and consist of sandy dark clay overlying a yellow clay latosol, covered with a secon- dary growth of vegetation. Two or more 2 x 2 m units were excavated using 10 cm artificial levels in 5 of the sites, while the other 3 sites lacked sufficient depth of occupation to be excavated. Surface collec- tions made in the 8 sites indicate that they were habitation sites, however the Tauari site (PA-AT-8) also contained funerary urns. Thousands of sherds and numbers of stone artifacts, soil samples, and hearths were found. All of the sites between Maraba and Santa Terezinha do Tauari appear to pertain to a single archaeological phase. Other sites in the area of Tucurui are still insufficiently sampled; however they appear to represent another phase with poly- chrome, incised, and punctate ceramics resembling materials found on the Amazon. Future research will cover the area between Santa Terezinha do Tauari and Tucurui and on to Cameta. This next step of research will increase the sample and allow for a better evaluation of the evidence. In the second half of 1977, the PRONAPABA program, with as many as 200 researchers and assistants, began working in 3 zones. Celso Perota (Museu de Arqueologia da Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo) and assistants began work at the confluence of the Iriri and Xingui rivers below the city of Altamira. Work was carried out in one area along the route of the Trans-Amazon highway and in two areas along the margin of the Xingii river. In all, 29 sites were discovered, consisting of 28 habitation sites and one petroglyph and pictograph site. The material of the habitation sites invariably include ceramics. One site along the highway also contained evidence of a preceramic occupation. Acre. Ondemar Dias and Franklin Levy and assistants (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro and Instituto Arqueologia Brasileira) carried out ar- chaeological survey work along the rivers Acre, Iquiri and Yaco at the headwaters of the Purus, where 20 sites were found. Peculiar ceramics and circular structures composed of walls and drainage ditches were found, and in some cases burial urns were found associated with the structures. Rondonia. Jose Wilson Rauth (Universidade Federal do Parana) reports having carried out research in the federal territory of Rondonia- Amazonas. Near the Mamor6 river at the Vila Agricola de Iata, fragments of large burial urns were found with T-shaped stone axes. Eurico Th. Miller and assistants (Museu de Arqueologia do Rio Grande do Sol) are beginning work on the upper Guapore river between Matto Grosso and Pontas Negras. Amazonas. Conceicio G. Correa and Ana Lucia Machado are planning to carry out work on the lower courses of the Uatuma and Jatapu rivers, while Mario F. Sim6es (Museu Goeldi) is planning to begin work on the middle Rio Negro between the cities of Barcelos and Tapuruquara. Piaui. Silvia Maranca (Universidade de Sao Paulo) did not participate in fieldwork during the reporting period; however she has continued her study of zoo- morphic representations found on the walls of rock shelters in the southwestern part of the state. Goi6s. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz, Altair Sales Bar- bosa, Avelino Fernandes de Miranda, and Silvia Moehlecke (Universidade Cat6lica de Goias and In- stituto Achietano de Pesquisas) carried out 50 days of field research. The aim was to complete work previously initiated on the upper Araguaia, upper Tocantins, and Paranaiba rivers. This area is con- sidered to be of particular importance, since it joins the headwaters of rivers draining into the Parana, Sao Francisco, and Amazon rivers. Samples were taken from more than 23 ceramic sites of south- central Goias. Three distinct ceramic traditions have been identified in the area. In the west, near the Araguaia river, are found Uru-tradition ceramics characterized by cariape temper and vessel forms used to prepare manioc. The Uru tradition dates no earlier than the 12th century. In the east, 23 sites of the Mossamedes phase are of an unidentified tradi- tion. The Mossamedes phase dates from about 800 A.D. and is characterized by pear-shaped and glob- ular vessels. Only mineral temper occurs in the early phase, while cariape temper also occurs later. In the south of the research area, ceramics of the Tupiguarani painted subtradition were found. Vessel forms for the preparation of manioc have been found that are tempered with ground sherd. The Tupi- guarani tradition and the Mossameda phase of the east relate to cultures that apparently existed con- temporaneously. A number of phases found in the area between the traditions indicate acculturation and diffusion. These intermediate phases, including the Itaberai phase with 2 sites, may be a link between elements of the Mossamedes and Tupiguarani phases. Schmitz also reports finding 6 sites of the Paleoindian Paranaiba phase dated between 10,750 and 5700 years ago. Material representing an intermediate lithic complex were found at 9 rock shelter sites, and 11 rock shelter sites containing both lithic and ceramic artifacts have been dated to about 1000 years ago. Further work will be carried out in this area in the near future. Rio de Janeiro. Ondemar Ferreira Dias Junior (Instituto de Arqueologia Brasileira) reports on ex- cavations carried out at the Corond6 site (RJ-JC-64). During the month of February a team of archaeol- ogists composed of Ondemar Dias, Eliana Caravalho, and Lilia Cheuiche excavated 10 2 x 2 m units at the site. Artifacts found in the upper levels include chipped-quartz stone tools, worked shells, bone, and ceramic artifacts. Intrusive burials are believed to be of relatively recent date, while the remainder of the site is considered to belong to the Itaipu tradition. Clifford Evans (Smithsonian Institution) obtained dates of 4205 115 radiocarbon years: 2255 B.C. (SI 2778) and 4260+75 radiocarbon years: 2310 B.C. 528 [Vol. 43, No. 3,1978]</page><page sequence="20">CURRENT RESEARCH (SI-2781) for the basal and intermediate levels. The Corond6 site is characteristic of the fishing and col- lecting cultures of the coast of Rio de Janeiro. For a description of the site see American Antiquity, 41:229. Minas Gerais. Work was carried out by Calasans Rodrigues and Sonia Perez at the site Abrigo do Bo- queirao Soberbo (MG-VG-11) in the district of Varvelgndia. Work begun in 1976 was continued with the opening of two new 4m2 cuts. Artifacts of chipped chalcedony and polished diabase were found. Food remains recovered from the hearths in- cluded small nuts and ears of corn. A date of 4905 85 radiocarbon years: 2955 B.C. (SI-2789) is associated with the maize cobs. This site will be the object of more complete excavations in the near future. Excavations in the calcareous cave site Gentio (MG-RP-6) in the district of Unai were carried out by Eliana Caravalho and Lilia Cheuiche. Nearly 50 m2 of site have been excavated to an average depth of 140 cm. Besides materials reported previously, chipped stone points of flint, chalcedony, and quartz and spatulas of bone have been found. Pieces of fabric, calabash, and artifacts of calabash were found in the upper levels. Food refuse found in great hearths in- clude palm nuts, corn, peanuts, land snails, lake shells, and various animal bones. Flexed burials wrapped in nets and leaves were found with accom- panying funerary ceramics, leather, calabashes, or- naments of teeth, shells, and seeds. The upper ceramic levels of the Gentio site are dated at 3490 + 120 radiocarbon years: 1540 B.C. (SI-2788), while the intermediate levels are dated to 8215 + 120 radiocarbon years: 6265 B.C. (SI-2373). Dates for the basal levels are awaited. Ondemar Dias and Eliana Caravalho carried out survey work in three sectors of Minas Gerais. A total of 15 sites pertaining to the Sapucai phase of the Sapucai tradition and the Belvedere phase of the Tupiguarani ceramic tradition were found. Work was concentrated in the region of the Sapucai river which will be flooded with the completion of the Fur- nas dam. Survey work was carried out in two new areas of Minas Gerais. Work carried out by Claro Calasans Rodrigues and Arthur Jardim Filho revealed 3 new sites with pictographs in calcareous caves of the Bambui formation. In the area of Unai, Franklin Levy found three new sites that will be excavated in the near future. Espirito Santo. Celso Perota reports that Dagma Luzia dos Santos, Marcia Regina Nunes Ribeiro, Marcia Rachel, and Fernando de Carvalho carried out salvage work on the sambaqui Limao located at the edge of a mangrove swamp on Vict6ria Bay. The work was financed by the Instituto do Patrim6nio Hist6rico e Artistico Nacional. Archaeological work consisted of opening a 2 x 6 m trench through the center of the sambaqui to a depth of 2.6 m. The site is believed to be peculiar because of the predominance of shell and bone tools. The lithic industry consists only of axe blades. Burials regularly showed evidence of funerary ritual. Rio de Janeiro. Maria Concercao de M. C. Beltrao (Museu Nacional) reports on continued excavations at the sambaqui Sernambetiba. The upper levels of the site have been greatly intermixed, and its north side has been destroyed by the construction of a road. Because of the great size of the sambaqui, ar- bitrary 20 cm levels were used in its excavation. The total of 48 m2 of excavations has revealed a great variety of artifacts. Bone tools include double- pointed objects that may have served as point barbs, single-pointed bone tools that may have served as perforators, and triangular bone points that resem- ble lance heads. Hammers and anvil stones for breaking small palm nuts, flaked-quartz tools and hammer stones were also found. Traces of hematite, which were probably used for paint, have been found throughout the site. Two poorly conserved secondary adult burials, found associated with perforated fish bone heads and stone axes, were apparently intru- sive from the upper levels. A small quantity of thick- walled red utility ceramics were only found in the up- per levels of the sambaqui. Evidence of diet includes mollusc shells, fish bones, and some bird and mam- mal bones. Small carbonized palm nuts are the only evidence of vegetable food found. URUGUAY. Annette Laming Emperaire, a forerun- ner of Eastern Brazilian archaeology, died in May of 1977. At the time of her death she was involved in ex- cavations in the Salto Grande area of Uruguay. Her research was supported by the French government and UNESCO. The work she initiated will be con- tinued by Niede Guidon (Musee de 1'Homme). Archaeological survey by both land and air was completed in the area of Salto Grande, where a dam will soon be constructed. The geomorphology of the area was studied and geological maps were pre- pared. The zone that will be inundated extends 120 km to the north of Salto. The width of the lake will vary from .5 to 40 km. More than 100 sites were located, many of which were in advanced stages of destruction. The richness of archaeological sites in the zone required immediate excavations, which were scheduled for 1977. Excavations were carried out in 2 areas, one near Salto Grande and the other along the margins of a low area on the Arapey river. A total of 5 sites were studied in the zone of Salto Grande. Site 57 on the margin of the Uruguay river is a habitation site, the first levels of which contained ceramic materials as well as stone tools. The lower levels contained only stone artifacts. The two levels were separated by 2 or 3 cm of intermediate strata. In one extremity of the site 80 burials were found. Bones were placed upon sand or in small pits and covered with large stones. In many cases they ap- peared burnt or artificially colored red. Skeletons were never found in natural positions. Preliminary physical anthropological analysis indicates that the bodies were dismembered and defleshed without eliminating tendons and nerves and then buried. Skulls, arms and legs were disarticulated in a man- ner suggesting cannibalism. Site 58 located on an island near Salto Grande also consisted of a succession of ceramic and lithic floors. 529</page><page sequence="21">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The top levels contained a large quantity of richly decorated and varied ceramics including three urns of Spanish origin. The site contained archaeological remains in deep levels below the actual level of the river. One complete skeleton of a robust individual was found that lacked its skull. In the place of the skull was a pile of snail shells. The crushed skull was found some 30 cm from the burial and 5 cm above it. In all levels were found carbon, ocher, animal bones, and food remains. Sites 62, 63, and 71 were found to contain similar strata, with lithic materials capped by ceramic materials. In the lithic levels of site 62 were found rounded stone plaques with geometric engraved de- sign on 1 or 2 sides. Shortly after excavations were begun in the se- cond area, along the Arapey river, heavy rains and floods halted the work. It was possible to verify the existence of very deep sites with stone artifacts found 30 cm to 2 m below a level of volcanic ash. This work in Uruguay has shed light on the pre- history of a previously little known area and has demonstrated that the area was densely populated since ancient times. The sites were large throughout the sequence but were largest in most recent times. Work will continue in this area in 1978 under the direction of Niede Guidon. Laboratory work will con- tinue through 1979, and it is expected to be published in 1980. Ronald L. Weber CARIBBEAN pits were excavated at the entrance of Los Gemelos cave in the municipality of Morovis. Materials ob- tained include single- and double-side grinding stones, utilized stone flakes, chopping tools, scrapers, hammerstones, flake cores, various types of flaked stone tools, pieces of red ocher, debitage, and animal and shellfish food remains. Charcoal samples were also collected. No ceramic material was found. Both the archaeological context of the materials and the technological attributes of the artifacts have lead Davila to formulate a new preceramic complex in Puerto Rican archaeology. This is the first preceramic site to be located in the interior moun- tains of the island; the only other two sites were found on the coast. Radiocarbon dates obtained in the past for Puerto Rican preceramic occupation range from 325 B.C. to A.D. 120. GUADELOUPE. Denis Emond (U. of Montreal) ex- cavated the ceramic site of Taliseronde on the east coast of the island of Marie-Galante. Pottery recovered indicates occupation during the second phase of the Insular Saladoid tradition (A.D. 300 to A.D. 600). No traces of houses or structures were found. A complete adult burial was excavated; it had been placed in a pit with four intact bowls. Bones of fish, crabs, and rodents point to the exploitation of sea and coastal resources. The area of the site is about 7.5 ha, of which only less than 1-/o was excavated. PUERTO RICO. Under the direction of Ovidio Davila (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture), two test Charles A.
