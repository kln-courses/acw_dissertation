His views appear to have influenced a tradition of map-making, as evidenced by an unusual late antique map that locates parts of Odysseus's voyage from Aeaea to Hades according to Crates' geography. This essay elucidates Crates' geographical accounts of the Homeric Laestrygonians and of the constellation Draco and his understanding of the arctic circle in light of the map and of earlier geographers, particularly Pytheas of Massalia, who similarly incorporated Homeric references into his theorizing about the fixed arctic circle. INTRODUCTION crates of mallos, aristarchus's "arch-enemy," was a second-century b.c.e. grammarian (he would have prefered the title kritikos),1 whose con tribution to Homeric exegesis is increasingly acknowledged and studied in its own right.2 His contributions to geography, however, are in general not judged favorably: he is described "bestenfalls als interessierter und ver 1 Fr. 94, cf.

Romm 1992: 130). Crates' interpretation of the Homeric epics is usually styled as "Stoic," but this notion is unsubstantiated (Asmis 1992: 140; Porter 1992: 85-86). It is also a regular feature of both ancient and modern criticism to charge Crates with reading either Stoic or his own idiosyncratic principles into Homer, taking his poems as cosmic allegories (Asmis 1992: 141; Porter 1992: 72; cf. Graf 1993:194,198). A good example of this practice is offered by Geminus of Rhodes (fl. first cent, b.c.e.), who in his Introduction to the Phenomena ac cuses Crates of "fabulously distorting" Homer's descriptions (Porter 1992:87) or simply "speaking in marvels" about them (Evans and Berggren 2006: 215) and, further, of reading his own theory of sphairopoiia into what Homer had actually said.8 A similar accusation is found in Philodemus (P.Hercul. 1676 fr. 2 = fr. 99) and Heraclitus {All. 27.2 = fr. 3). Such charges are, on the whole, 3 Abel 1974:1052.4-5. Generally, "his reputation is not very enviable... he is regarded as something of a crank" (Asmis 1992: 138). He is referred to as "a highly eccentric geographer-critic" by Romm 1992: 179, while Thomson 1948: 202-3 calls his Homeric geographical exegesis a "strange aberration" and his theory of oceans "hardly better than an idle fancy of misguided scholars." 4 E.g., Aujac 1987b: 162-64.

Crates' approach to Homer and his interpretative method were thus highly idiosyncratic, with his belief in the Poet's "wide learning" allowing him to interpret Homer's stories as "scientific hypotheses."9 THE MAP Given Crates' reception and influence, it comes as no surprise that there is an ancient map based on his geographical and allegorizing teachings. It is a unique graphical representation, embodying not only his geographical conceptions, but also his allegorizing interpretation of a section of Homer's narrative. The existence of the map supports the tradition that Crates made a model, a terrestrial globe or a sphairopoiia, "presumably as a visual analogue to his Homeric exegeses" (Porter 1992: 88).10 A version of the map was first published by Neugebauer 1975a (cf. 1975b: 735). Jacob 1988: 2 suggested that the influence of "a theory recognized by Hellenistic thinkers," especially Crates of Mallos, concerning the four quarters of the earth, might have been at work in the making of the map, as evidenced by the presence of the antoikoumené. He also recognized (at least) three levels of knowledge employed in the making of the map (geographical, cosmologi cal, eschatological: Jacob 1988: 4), but did not further develop his thoughts in this direction. The map is preserved in three copies as a part of an astrological compen dium and in nine further copies accompanying the anonymous scholia to Theon's commentary on Ptolemy's Procheiroi kanones (Edson and Savage Smith 2000: 27).11 All twelve examples show a great similarity with one another, albeit with minor differences.12 The map depicts a zonal division of 9&gt;EmaTr|(!oviKäc; üttoGeoek;: Strabo 3.4.4 = fr. 75; cf.

Within the "bay" thus formed, there is an inscription: the "sea towards15 antoikoumené''16 "Out of" this sea/bay flow the "River Lethe" (no. 30) and "Pyriphlegethon River" (no. 31), running in a curved course through the temperate zone of the antoikoumené and then flowing into the "Marsh of Acheron" (no. 32), precisely at the antarctic circle.17 The Acheron stretches in the form of a semicircle almost to the south pole.18 The equatorial sea, or, more precisely, the ocean extending between the temperate zones—a distinctive feature of Crates' system—represents, as attested in literary sources, the "sea" that Odysseus must pass going from Aeaea to the "river ocean's stream" and Hades, and back (Od. 12.1-4; cf. 11.1-2,11), while said stream, "an estuary or a gulf stretching from the winter tropic (xetuepivóc; TpomKÓc;) towards the South Pole (vcmoc; toXoc;)" (fr. 57 ap. Strabo 1.1.7), is represented by"the sea (stretching) towards the antoikoumené" on the map. This branch of the Ocean, according to both Crates' literary exegesis and the map, divides the landmass of the southern hemisphere into two parts (Mette 1936:75-78; Broggiato 2001: liii, 224).19 If we compare the map with Crates' description as provided by Strabo, we see that the sea on the map stretches from approximately midway between the equator and winter tropic to halfway between the tropic and the pole, while Crates described the avd^uaic; or kóXttoc; as commencing at the tropic itself. Nonetheless, it seems that the map, at least the part representing 15 Again Kara, this time left untranslated by Edson and Savage-Smith 2000: 28. Cf.

On another map from the same context (Marcianus gr. 314, fol. 222v) it almost touches the pole (Neugebauer 1975a, PL III.2; Dilke 1985, PL 29; Jacob 1988: 3, Fig. 1).

The question is whether Odysseus started off from the western border of the oikoumené—along the southern section of the "Atlantic" (so Mette)—or from the eastern, which would be more in line with Homer's text (Aeaea in the east, Od. 12.3-4).</page><page sequence="6">300 Tomislav Bilic the southern hemisphere, depicts Crates' ideas of (cosmic) geography, with indisputable Hades-related toponyms placed in the southern hemisphere. THE WORLD ACCORDING TO CRATES I: THE CIMMERIANS AND HADES/TARTARUS Strabo's description of Crates' geography undeniably places Hades at the very south pole; this corresponds to the latter's placing of the Cimmerians at the pole(s) as well. According to Crates (fr. 53, cf. Lehmann-Haupt 1921: 426.35-36), the Cimmerians are identical to the "Cerberians" and live at both poles,20 or solely at the south pole,21 and the meteorological characteristics of their land as described in the Odyssey correspond to those at the pole.22 In fr. 54 Crates is said to have placed Homer's Cimmerians below the north pole; but Mette emends 0epivó&lt;; tpoTUKÓc; (Gemin. Elem. Astron. 6.17) in this fragment to the more plausible x£i|iepivóc; Tpomicóc;.23 Crates' symmetrical arrangement of the continents on the earth's surface, however, could have allowed him to distribute the Cimmerians to both poles, since Homer's description of me teorological characteristics of their country, as understood by Crates, could equally be applied to either of the two extreme points on the earth's surface. What we know for certain is that Crates also compared (fr. 7) meteorological features under the poles with Homer's description of Tartarus, most probably 20Thus Berger 1904: 15;Wrede 1937: 1971.19-21. 21 Thus Mette 1936: 84nl, 88,92; Broggiato 2001: xlix, liv, 222. 22 Cf. schol.

Per. 586 (GGM 2.451-52) associates Od. 11.19 (the darkness of the Cimmerian land) and 12.4 (Helios's risings on Aeaea) with a respective six-month day and a six-month night in the farthest north and south when the sun is in the northern and southern portions of its voyage, respectively (from the vernal to the autumnal equinox, and vice versa). But this applies only to the poles; at the arctic circles, on the other hand, the sun both rises and sets during these periods, except on the very solstices. For the Cerberians, cf. Ax.

Thus Crates' idea of the southern hemisphere as it is attested in literary sources conforms to its representation on the map. THE WORLD ACCORDING TO CRATES Ii: LAESTRYGONIANS, DRACO, AND THE ARCTIC CIRCLE The Cimmerians suggest the presence of another of Homer's mythical peoples discussed by Crates, unfortunately not represented on the map: the Laestrygonians. According to Homer, the Laestrygonians achieved a cer tain level of civilization, as opposed to the carefree Lotophagoi and lawless Cyclopes.24 Nevertheless, they are described as giants {Od. 10.111,120) and cannibals (10.116,124). The name of their city (or the epithet describing it, as argued strongly by Page 1973:34-35), Télepylos, translates as "distant gate."25 The main feature of the land of the Laestrygonians, however, is the fact that here "the paths of night and day are close together" (Od. 10.86: Y^P vuktóc; te Kai f]|iaTÓc; e'ioi k¿Aeu0oi). This verse has been analyzed in various ways by both ancient scholiasts and modern investigators, who have often come to different conclusions in their interpretations of its significance.26 24 They practice cattle-breeding (implicit in Od. 10.82-85); know of fire (10.99); their land is traversed with wagon-roads (10.103^1); they live in a city (10.81-82,104,108,118); and their mode of government is characterized by some kind of an assembly (10.114), a king (10.110), and a queen (10.112-15). "Woodbury 1966:612; Frame 1978:60; Kappel 2001:18; Marinatos 2001:403; Nakassis 2004:225 all translate the name in similar terms ("distant,""far-away,""far away,""Ferntor," and "far gate," respectively), while West 1997:406-7; 2005:62 renders it as "distant portal"; Page 1973: 35-36, who does not accept the usual translation, claims that the adjective Tr|Xé7ti)Xoc; could only mean "far-gated" (cf.

According to one group of sources, he certainly understood the phenomenon of the change in the duration of the longest day depending on the latitude, and supposedly also the concept of the fixed arctic circle; according to another, he did not quite understand the difference between the always visible—changeable—and the fixed arctic circle. Thus, according to fr. 50 he compared the main feature of the land of the Laestrygonians with Aratus's description of the constellation Draco (Phaen. 61-62), placing the territory "about (rtepi) the head of Draco," that is, in the area directly below it.27 The head of Draco, according to Aratus, vioaetai, rj^L 7t£p áKpai / [iíayovTai Súoiéc; re Kai ctvTo\ai aXXi]Xr]Oiv, "wheels near where the limits of setting and rising blend" (Mair 1921: 211) or, in the words of other translators, "moves where the limits of rising and setting are confounded" (Evans and Berggren 2006: 5), "passes through the point where the end of settings and the start of risings blend with each other" (Kidd 1977: 77), or "goes around near the place where the limits of setting and rising mingle to gether."28 This conception of Draco's movements in Aratus is certainly derived from Eudoxus, as confirmed by Hipparchus (1.4.7-8, 32.25-34.21 Manitius = Eudoxus fr. 16 Lasserre = Attalus fr. 5 Maass). 27 Schol.

"Crates supposes that the nights in Laestrygonia were short; and that the reason for this is that the people lived near [Broggiato (forthcoming; see nl): "close to"] the head of the constellation Draco, about which the astronomer poet Aratus says [Phaen. 61-62]. Thus, because the star's rising and setting are very close together, Homer can say [Od. X.86]" (schol. HQ Od. 10.86, translation in Page 1973: 43). We will explain shortly what "directly below" means. Page's translation is somewhat misleading in that what Crates actually says is simply "for this reason—the proximity of risings to settings ..." rather than the rising/setting of any particular asterism (compare the translation in Broggiato [forthcoming; see nl ]: "accordingly, since the risings are close to the settings"). Only in schol. Q Phaen. 62 does Crates explicitly connect the rising(s) and setting(s) to the phenomena associated with the constellation Draco as observed from the latitude of Greece. 28Broggiato (forthcoming; see nl).

Page 1973: 43 was right in believing that Crates placed the Laestrygonians "below the head of Draco" due to the shortness of their nights, but was wrong to assume that the shortness was explained by Crates with reference to Draco's short "star-time." Perhaps Page was rather referring to the constellation's short disappearance below the horizon observed from either Greece or some higher northern lati tude, since Draco is anything but "a very short-lived star." Moreover, if Crates was aware of the different visibility of stars depending on the latitude of the observer—a hypothesis we will discuss below—he would have known that a "Laestrygonian" high-latitude Draco would be completely circumpolar.29 It is therefore perhaps better to understand tie pi Tr]v K£(paXf]v xoö öpctKovioc; as "(directly) below the head of Draco" in the sense of, the area "where the head of Draco is at the zenith."30 The head of Draco is at the zenith when observed from 53°-55°24' northern latitude,31 or from 52°57'33"-58°07'16" 29 Abel 1974: 1052.3-1053.14 claims that Crates' understanding of latitude was very limited; if he was truly unaware of the phenomenon mentioned, then Abel's claim would be correct. But see below. 30 Cf. Page 1973:43, who understands Crates' words as referring to the "region imme diately below" Draco. Mette 1936: 86-87,91-92 also thinks that the expression refers to the region where the head of Draco is at the zenith, but further believes that Crates associ ated this region with the one in which the longest day is of 23 hours. "Directly overhead on the meridian" is usually expressed with phrases such as Aristotle's úrtó (thus, únó tí)v ápKTÓv, Mete. 2.5.362b8; Dicks 1970:210). Geminus regularly uses the phrases "under the equator" or "under the pole" (Elem. Astron. 5.36,38,42,43 [54.23-24, 56.11-13, 58.3-4, 58.11-12 Manitius], 6.23 [76.25-26 Manitius]) precisely in the meaning "directly" or "vertically under." This also applies to the use of such expressions in Parmenides (T74 Coxon = DK 28A44a = Aét. 3.11.4), Eratosthenes, Polybius, Posidonius, and Strabo, which refer to the areas "under" the poles, tropics, and the equator (Eratosth. IIA5 Berger = fr. 45 Roller, Posid. fr. 49, 208 E-K, Polyb. 34.1.7, 16-17, Strab. 2.2.3, 3.1-3, 5.37, 43). For Eratosthenes (IIB26 Berger = fr. 44 Roller ap. Gemin. Elem. Astron. 15.3), the terrestrial equator is directly below the celestial one; Polybius, when referring to the zones "below the arctic circles" (Strabo 2.3.1-2 = Polyb. 34.1.14-15), probably has in mind the territories below the entire (ant)arctic celestial zones, as does Plutarch when referring to ímapKTÍaiv kXijícitcov (Mar. 11.4, cf. Sert. 17.3), while Ptol. Tetr. 2.2.3 generally discusses the northern peoples living under the Bears (imó tck; ápierouc;), who have the constellations directly above their heads. Stob. Flor. 1.49.45 also uses the expression in a similar meaning, refer ring to an anthropomorphic image of the earth with feet placed in the north, as well as to the inhabitants of this northern region. 31 Using the values of Hipparchus, 1.4.8, p. 34.10-14 Manitius: the head of Draco stretches from 34°36' to 37°. The information in Cleomedes {De motu circ. 1.5.59 Todd), placing the head of Draco at the zenith for Lysimachia (c. 40°40' north latitude), is certainly erroneous, because the southernmost stars in the head (6y Draconis, declination 52°54' in</page><page sequence="10">304 Tomislav Bilic in the time of Hipparchus, and 53°15'47"-58021'45" in the time of Eudoxus. This is much to the south of the fixed arctic circle, but is precisely on the always visible circle of Rhodes (54°), used by majority of astronomers as the arctic circle (see below). Therefore, it would seem that Crates, in associating the Laestrygonians with the constellation Draco, located them with reference to the always visible circle of Rhodes, which he took as the arctic circle. We might perhaps go a bit further than this. Neugebauer claims that the origin of the use of the latitude of 54° (= 36° from the pole) should not be sought with reference to the latitude of Rhodes, but rather associated with "a cosmologic doctrine of'pythagorean' flavor" (1972: 247, cf. 1975b: 733), which carved out a quadrant of 15 parts (90°) from a circle of 60 parts (360°) and divided it up according to a "neat numerical pattern" of 4 (24°, from the equator to the tropic): 5 (30°, from the tropic to the arctic circle): 6 (36°, from the arctic circle to the pole). The resultant position of the arctic circle was later "translated" into the Rhodes-determined always visible circle. Whether Crates was aware of this tradition is another question, but it would certainly strengthen his cosmological argument.32 Dicks 1960:24-25 claims that it is "very unlikely" that Eudoxus was aware of the fixed arctic circle and that he calculated his (always-visible) circle with reference to the latitude of Rhodes, placing it at 54°.33 In this Eudoxus was followed by many: thus, for example, Eratosthenes,34 Geminus,35 Manilius (.Astron. 1.565-67), Hyginus (Astron. 1.6.2), Achilles Tatius (Isag. 26, 29 = 100 B.c.E.) were at least 12° further north (Tozer 1897: 169-70 and Keyser 2001: 363-65 argue for Dicaearchus as the author of this measurement). Furthermore, Cleomedes gives the head's declination as 48° (1.5.60 Todd), which neither corresponds to his previous statement nor to the real value. 32 For Crates' (fr. 34ab Mette) division of the sphere into five or six zones according to this pattern (6-5-4), see Mette 1936: 66-67 and Uhden 1936: 108. 33 Stevens 1980: 270 believes that Eudoxus had calculated the value for an arctic circle with reference to Knidos, which was later adopted for the latitude of Rhodes. Bianchetti 1998: 43, 153 believes that it was Pytheas who was the first to recognize the difference between the always-visible and fixed arctic circle. 34IIB 19 Berger/Ml Roller ap. Gemin. Elem.

Strabo disagreed with Hipparchus (see below) and placed the northern limit of the inhabited world somewhat more (2.1.13) or less (2.5.6 = Eratosth. fr. 30 Roller, 2.5.9 = fr. 34 Roller) than 38,800 stadia north of the equator,40 that is, at approximately 55°25'42", which is a value still close to the "Rhodian" standard.41 Elsewhere Strabo claims that the arctic circle—which is what Homer meant by "the Bear"42—touches the earth at its northernmost inhabited point or limit, which is the same as the most northerly point on the horizon (1.1.6).43 Since we have his explicit estimate of the most northern habitable latitude, we can 36 On the other hand, Theon is also well aware of variable arctic circles at different latitudes (Astron. 3.9,133.6-10 Hiller). 37In Somn. 2.6.3-6 (2.6.3-5 = Eratosth.

For the purpose of some of his tables, Ptolemy in the Almagest takes into account the parallels up to the limit of 54°1' (Aim. 2.8, 1.140-41 Heiberg; Berggren and Jones 2000: 18); as late as the 14th century, accounts of high northern latitudes started at the ultimum clima at 54° (Taylor 1956: 59,65,67). 40 8,800 stadia is the distance from the equator to the southern limit of the inhabited world (Strab. 2.1.13,17,2.2 [= Eratosth. IIB22 Berger, fr. 58 Roller = Posid. fr. 49 E-K], 5.6 [= fr. 30 Roller], 35 [= fr. 57 Roller]). 41 Bianchetti 1998: 156-57 calculates different values, using Strabo's conflicting data on the northern limit of the oikoumené, but they all fall between 54° and 56°. 42II. 18.487-89 (= Od. 5.273-75). Crates shares this opinion of Strabo, although he expresses it somewhat differently (F 27). See Dicks 1970: 49; Broggiato 2001: 190; and Giampaglia 1998: 507-10 for three different emendations.

Strabo further interprets Heraclitus's statement (22B120 D-K) to the same effect. Kirk 1962: 289 (cf. Marcovich 2001: 337) suggests that Strabo thinks that Heraclitus's "limits" refer to the always vis ible and always invisible circles, an interpretation that Berger 1903: 79 and Burnet 1920: 135n5 believe is probably right. Arist. Poet. 1461a20-21 accepts the reading "only," but argues that it was used because the Bear is the most conspicuous constellation of those that never set (Lucas 1968: 242). 43 Cf. schol.

Thus, he adhered to the "teoría aristotélica" (Bianchetti 1998: 163,185,194-95),44 that is, the "Rhodian" standard. However, this was not the only theory known to the ancients. Thus, for example, Martianus Capella unusually placed the arctic circle at 50° (8.837).45 More important is an idea present in Hipparchus: he placed the river Borysthenes 34,000 stadia north of the equator (ap. Strabo 2.1.13 = fr. 59 Dicks, cf. 2.1.17). Since he also placed the parallel of Borysthenes 3,800 stadia north of the Massalia/Byzantion parallel,46 and since he knew of an inhabited area more than 9,100 stadia north of Massalia,47 Hipparchus's northern limit— taking into account all the available distances—was at least 38,900 to 39,500 stadia north of the equator (55°34'17" or 56°25'43"), but more probably even farther to the north.48 Ptolemy, together with Marinus of Tyre (ap. Ptol. Geog. 1.7.1),49 placed the northern limit of the oikoumené, together with Thoulé, at 63°.50 This latitude was later accepted by Islamic authors Al-Khwärazmi, Suhräb (Tibbetts 1992: 102,105n69), and the anonymous author of Hudüd al-'Älam (2.3, 5, 4.26; Minorsky 1970: 50-51, 59), while al-Idrlsi placed the 44 Cf. Kidd 1988: 2.742, 744-45. For Aristotle, see below. 45 Neugebauer 1975b: 590 believes that the text should be emended to correspond to the 6-5-4 standard, which would place the limit of the arctic zone at 54°. 46Hipparch. fir. 54,57 Dicks ap. Strabo 2.5.8,42. In the last reference the Borysthenes is placed 34,100 stadia from the equator, while in 2.5.41 (Hipparch. fr. 52 Dicks) Byzantion is 30,300 stadia north of the equator (in 2.1.12 = Hipparch. fr. 15 Dicks the distance is 29,800 stadia); in 2.1.12 = Hipparch. fr. 59 Dicks (cf. 2.1.16) the distance between the two is 3,700 stadia. 47 Strabo 2.1.18 = fr. 61 Dicks = Pytheas fr. 6b Mette, T 5 Roseman. 48 Hipparchus gives the altitude of the sun on the winter solstice for this region as less than 3 cubits (if we take this to mean 2 Vi cubits this implies the latitude of 61°17') and the longest day as 19 hours (61°2') (Dicks 1960:185; Roseman 1994:43; Bianchetti 1998: 181, giving the latter figure as 62°2'). Compared with other data reported by Strabo, where a 2° difference is evident (Dicks 1960: 185,188; cf. Diller 1934: 266-67; Bianchetti 1998: 181), this limit was placed (by Strabo) at ca. 59°10' north (= ca. 41,400 stadia; actually, ca. 42,800 = 61°10', cf. Dicks 1960:193). 49 Jones and Keillar 1996: 48 have tried to reconstruct Marinus's theory from the data in Ptolemy, and claim that he placed Thoulé at ca. 69°, although Ptolemy explicitly claims that he placed it at 63°. 50Geog. 1.20.8, 23.1 (= 1.23.22 Nobbe), 24.5, 2.3.14 (62°40'—63°15'), 3.5.1 Müller, 6.16.1, 7.5.12, 16, 6.7-8, 8.3.3 Nobbe (7.5.16 and 8.3.3 only mention the longest day of 20 hours on Thoulé).

Nansen 1911: 2.203).51 Thus the Marinus/Ptolemy conception of the northern limit of the oikoumetie approaches the latitude corresponding to the fixed arctic circle, of which both authors were well aware. Others were even closer to this value. Thus Eratosthenes placed Thoulé 11,500 stadia north of the Borysthenes (II C 2 Berger = fir. 35 Roller ap. Strabo 1.4.2; cf. 1.4.4), which means 46,300 stadia north of the equator (= 66°8'34"), according to Diller 1934:264.52 Diller arrived at this figure by taking the value for the distance from the Cinnamon-bearing country to Meroe as 3,000 stadia,53 rather than 3,400,54 and the value for the distance from Alexandria to the Hellespont as 8,000 stadia,55 rather than 8,100 (1.4.2 = II C 2 Berger, fr. 35 Roller). If we take the alternative figures, which are precisely the ones specified in the chapter where the distance to Thoulé is also given, we arrive at the figure of 46,800 stadia = 66°51'24".56 Similarly, Al-Farghänl placed the northern limit of the oikoutnene at 66° (Tibbetts 1992: 102n59), while for Häfiz-i Abrü it was placed further to the north of 66° (Ahmad 1992: 170). In the same way, al-Dimashqi placed the northern limit on 66°10' or 66°25' (Nansen 1911: 2.212).57 51 Ibn Khaldoun (1377 c.e.) places it precisely at 64° (Second Prefatory Discussion of the Muqaddimah-, Rosenthal 1967: 1.50, 55, 56); he also mentions the opinions of other scholars: al-Khazini (63°, 20-hours longest day), al-Khizin (10th century; 60°45', the limit of the 7th clime), and "others" (77°) (Rosenthal 1967:1.114-15). 52 Dilke 1985: 33 and Uhden 1936: 100 have 46,400 stadia. On p. 34 Dilke has 46,300 stadia, if we take the distance from Borysthenes to Thoule as 11,500 stadia instead of the er roneous 16,500 stadia. Bunbury 1883:1.664 also has 46,300 stadia. If we take Eratosthenes' acceptance of Pytheas's placement of Thoulé on the fixed arctic circle together with the value reported for his calculation of the obliquity of the ecliptic (23°51 '20", Ptol. Aim. 1.12, 67.22-68.6 Heiberg = Hipparch. fr. 41 Dicks, Eratosth. IIB42 Berger/M8 Roller, Theon, Comm. ad loc., 2.528.20-529.3 Rome = Hipparch. fr. 41 Dicks, Eratosth.

Thus, again according to fr. 50, Crates compared the meteorological conditions characteristic of the land of the Laestrygonians with those obtaining in the far north—more precisely, in the area with the longest day on the summer solstice of 23 hours, and a meager one hour of night, where "the setting of the sun is near to its rising"58 and where, therefore, those that could stay awake could have earned double wages (Gemin. Elem. Astron. 6.10-12,72.2-20 Manitius).59 Consequently, the Laestrygonians would be placed somewhat to the south of the fixed arctic circle (cf. Mette 1936: 86). According to Ptolemy, however, the summer solstice day of 23 hours is located at 66° northern latitude {Aim. 2.6, 1.1.114.18-20 Heiberg),60 which 58 Translation in Heath 1932 [1991]: 133; cf. Evans and Berggren 2006: 163: "the set ting [point] draws near the rising [point]"; Broggiato (forthcoming; see nl): "the sunset is near the dawn" or "the sunset is close to sunrise." 59 The land of the Laestrygonians is also placed on the latitude with the longest solstitial day of 23 hours by schol. P Od. 10.86 (2.454 Dindorf) = fr. 37d Mette, while Priscianus Lydus, Solutiones ad Chosroen 4, 67.9-15 Bywater = fr. 37b Mette may have compared the 23-hour longest day in the north with the situation on Thoulé (Mette 1936: 85 with nl, however, claims that all he said was that in certain areas the longest day lasts for 23 hours, while on Thoulé there is a 24-hour day, since it is on the fixed arctic circle; Mette discards as an interpolation the notion of a 5- or 6-day continuous daytime in the area where the longest day is of 23 hours). On the other hand, schol. MDAKVUA Phaen. 62 = fr. 37h Mette (without Mette's emendation [1936: 87 with nl, 271]); schol. Dionys. Per. 582 (GGM2.451); Steph. Byz. s.v. ©oú\r|; and Eust. Dionys. Per. 581 (GGM2.329.30-33) all mention a 20-hour longest day on Thoulé, exactly as in Ptol. Aim. 2.6 (1.1.114.9-11 Heiberg), where Thoulé, with the longest day of 20 hours, is placed at 63° north (cf. Geog. 7.5.16, 8.3.3 Nobbe for the 20-hour day at Thoulé). Qazwini's Burdjan, a land located far to the north, with a 20-hour day and a 4-hour night (and vice versa), could refer to either the Normans or the Bulghars, and would apply equally well to both (cf. Nansen 1911:2.210). The latitude of Thoulé (63°) and the longest day of 20 hours were facts well known to Islamic authors (Shirazi, Ya'qubi, Battani, Dimashqi [Nansen 1911: 2.211-12; Dunlop 1957];cf.al-Khazini,who does not mention the island by name [Rosenthal 1967: 1.114-15], and Ulugh Beg, al-Tüsi, and al-Käshl, who all give the latitude of Büdan/Tawä as 63° [Kennedy and Kennedy 1987:32]); they received this information from Ptolemy (cf. a cosmological diagram in Vat. gr. 211 fol. 120r and 121v, where the 7th climate is named TOÚXrj; Neugebauer 1975a: 316-17). According to Hyg. Poet. astr. 4.3.3 = fr. 37i Mette, the inhabitants of the region "under the head of Draco" have a night of less than a third of an hour (presumably on the summer solstice), which further associates the region with Homer's Laestrygonians. 60 Ptolemy places the 24-hour day, thus the fixed arctic circle, at 66°08'40", 2.1.114.21— 115.7 Heiberg.</page><page sequence="15">Crates of Mallos and Pytheas of Massalia 309 would place the Laestrygonians effectively on the fixed arctic circle and the northern limit of the oikoumené according to Eratosthenes. Both the discussion in Geminus and that in Eratosthenes associate some of these concepts with the writings of Pytheas (a major source of Eratosthenes). Thus, according to Geminus, Pytheas mentions certain northern areas where "the night becomes very short... so that, a little while after setting, the sun rises straightaway."61 The similarity of Pytheas's description to Homer's was probably the reason why Crates and Geminus believed that it referred to the conditions imagined by the poet. After his mention of Pytheas, Geminus continues his paraphrase of Crates: "For indeed, since around these places62 the longest day is 23 equinoctial hours, the night lacks only one hour of being shortened to nothing, so that the setting [point] draws near the rising [point and is separated from it only] by the very short arc of the summer tropic," glossing (still following Crates?) Od. 10.86 as "the setting [point] lies near the rising point" (fr. 50 = Gemin. Elem. Astron. 6.11-12, 72.10-20 Manitius).63 This "solar" explanation certainly seems plausible enough. But the main objection to Crates' theory in general is that he seems to have believed that Aratus's verses (and Eudoxus's theories behind them) refer to the risings and settings of the sun, to which Homer's description certainly applies, while it is reasonable to assume that the Hellenistic poet is speaking instead of the risings and settings of the constellation Draco itself.64 It seems unlikely that 61 Fr. 9a Mette = fr. 8 Roseman = fr. 13a Bianchetti ap.

Strabo 2.3.8, Kidd 1988:1.268-70) similarly believes that Aratus's "rising" and "setting" refer to the eastern and western semicircle of the horizon or the section of the sun's path from the eastern horizon to the meridian and from the meridian to the western horizon, respectively. (The latter is most probably also the opinion of Posidonius, who interprets Homer's "setting" as "descending from the meridian towards the horizon" [see Mette 1936: 73-74]; cf. schol.

Perhaps, though, what they actually assert is that Crates associated only the terms "rising" and "setting" with the diurnal path of the sun, without an explicit reference on his part to the constellation Aratus was describing. If Crates truly connected the position of the land of the Laestrygonians with the latitude of the fixed arctic circle, no matter whether he understood it as such or not, as it would seem from this second set of evidence, then this would be in direct contradiction with the first set, according to which he associated it with the always visible circle of Rhodes taken as the arctic circle. Both versions cannot be right; perhaps, after all, Crates was indeed only "at best an interested and comparatively well-oriented layman." Then again, it seems unlikely that he understood the changeability of day length with respect to different latitudes but at the same time did not know the difference between the fixed arctic circle and the latitude-dependent always-visible circles. The introduction of Draco into the discussion may thus have been only secondary, and motivated by a cosmological doctrine demanding the neat division of the cosmic sphere.65 the semicircles of "rising" and "setting" meet at the meridian and that the head of Draco touches upon its northern intersection with the horizon; see also Kidd 1997:200. Achilles Tatius, Isag. 35 also gives two possible explanations: Aratus either had in mind the sec tion of the sun's path from the eastern horizon to the meridian and from the meridian to the western horizon, or the point where the head of Draco touches upon the meridian's northern intersection with the horizon.) This would make them meet only at the very meridian or the junction of the meridian with the horizon (cf. Strabo's comment on the arctic circle in 1.1.6), which makes this explanation implausible. Also, Strabo, Achilles, and the scholia (perhaps also Posidonius) are referring to the sun's diurnal path, which is only a conjecture. Similarly, Kirk 1962:292 believes that Heraclitus's "limits" (DK 22B120) represent the meridian. For an attempt to interpret Posidonius's suggestion (fr. 49 E-K ap. Strabo 2.3.7-8) for "improving" Crates' emendation (F 37, cf. fr. 34f Mette) of Homer's description of the Aethiopians' dwellings (Od. 1.24) by taking it as as referring to the sun's annual path, see Kidd 1988:1.269-70. According to this explanation, "setting" would mean the sun's path from the summer to the winter tropic, while "rising" would mean the sun's path from the winter to the summer tropic; "rising" and "setting" would thus meet at the solstices. Hippolytus (Haer. 4.47.4), citing Aratus, interprets the "rising" and "setting" as simply referring to the east and west, but his two hemispheres (in 4.43.8-9 the two hemispheres are the upper, consisting of pneuma and fire, and the lower, consisting of water and earth) do not make any sense in this context if they do not simply refer to an "eastern" (upper) and "western" (lower) hemisphere, thus allowing Draco to survey the entire longitudinal extension of the earth's northern hemisphere. 65 A provisional argument for Crates' familiarity with the concept of the fixed arctic circle can be extrapolated from the map. The inscription between the winter tropic and</page><page sequence="17">Crates of Mallos and Pytheas of Massalia 311 There is, however, another possibility. We have mentioned already (n28) that only in schol. Q Phaen. 62 (98 Martin) is Crates explicitly said to have explained "the rising(s) and setting(s)" with the phenomena associated with the constellation Draco considered determinative of an arctic circle.66 In every other source he associates Eudoxus's/Aratus's "rising(s) and setting(s)" with annual solar motion.67 Thus (solar) risings and settings were somehow linked to the fixed arctic circle and the limit of the sun's annual northern passage at c. 66° northern latitude. We hear of the sun's "proper limits" already in Heraclitus of Ephesus,68 which is certainly an allusion to the solstices (Lebedev 1989: 43; cf. Kirk 1962: 285; Kahn 1979: 109,156,160,199).69 Elsewhere the philosopher describes the Bear as "forming the limits of morning and evening" (DK 22B120 ap. Strabo 1.1.6),70 which seems to suggest that for Heraclitus the the antarctic circle states that the extension of this zone is 40 stadia in latitude (no. 28). It is possible that this figure refers to degrees; moreover, it has been suggested that the word yrj (no. 29), appended to no. 28, actually represents a misinterpretation of a copyist and that we should read "py" (i.e., 43) instead (Edson and Savage-Smith 2000: 14-15). This would present us with a division of a quarter of the globe with the proportions 23°51724° - 43° (lat. 66°51767°) - 23°09723°. This is only one of many proposed suggestions, and it is a tentative one, to say the least. 66 This is an exceptional report of Crates' exact words, as the anonymous reviewer points out to me, and thus deserves to be cited: i] xoö Apcucovtoi; K£(pa\r|, érti toí&gt; ápKtiKoü KaT£0TT]piY|iévr| kúkXou, öv au|ißeßr|Kev äeupavrj elvai Kara Tf|v repiayuryfiv xoö oüpavoö, TtepiayívETai ¿7t' aütöv töv ópí(ovta ktX. Cf. the translation of Broggiato (forthcoming; see n 1): the head of Draco is "placed on the arctic circle, that is always visible in the rota tion of the sky, turns about on the horizon itself" etc. Crates' actual explanation of the association of Aratus and Homer is rather unconvincing (cf. schol. MDAKVUA Phaen. 62, 100 Martin). 67 Schol. HQ Od. 10.86; schol. HV Od. 10.86; Eust. Od. 10.86, i.369; schol. MDKVUA Phaen. 62; Gemin. Elem. Astron. 6.10-12. A similar conclusion of Posidonius, Strabo, Achilles, and some of the scholiasts on Aratus referred to above could have originated with Crates. 6SP.Derv. 4.8: roi)[&lt;; öpouc;] - [öjpouc; é[auToü] or efipappevouc;] (see Lebedev 1989: 39, 46-47; Schönbeck 1993: 8, 17-20; Janko 2002: 8-9; Kouremenos, Parássoglou, and Tsantsanoglou 2006: 68-69,130); in a corresponding passage Plutarch (De. exil. 604A = DK 22B94) has the term (iétpa (in the meaning of "limits," cf.

Téppara) has a double meaning: "turning post," "turning point" (which is the only meaning present in the Iliad), but also "boundary," "endpoint," terminus (Kahn 1979: 51,161; Purves 2010: 56 with n88). Strabo here believes that Heraclitus employed the term "the Bear" for the "arctic (always visible) circle."</page><page sequence="18">312 Tomislav Bilic arctic circle was defined by the Ursa Major constellation.71 Aristotle likewise associates the northern uninhabitable zone with the Bear (Mete. 362b9),72 and he also defines the boundary of the northern temperate zone as the always visible circle, presumably that for the latitude of Greece (Mete. 362b3).73 Thus the Bear might have designated the limit of the temperate zone. Much later, Ptolemy defined the limit of the northern temperate zone as "the Bears" (Tetr. 2.2.6), and two passages in Avienius suggest the connection of the Ursa Major constellation with the limits of the annual solar movement.74 It is possible that Nonnus's northern turning-point beside which the Bears move also defines the northern limit of the sun's annual passage.75 Hecateus of Abdera's northern island of Helixoia76 suggests both the association with Heliké, that is, Ursa Major, and the verb eXiaoo), "to turn round or about" (Macurdy 1920:140-41; Thomson 1948:403), perhaps designating the sun's annual turning around a solstitial turning-post associated with Ursa Major.77 Although we cannot be sure whether either Heraclitus or Hecateus associated the Bear with the fixed arctic circle, it does not seem probable (although it is certainly not impossible) 71 Kahn 1979: 51,162 believes that the ovpoc; opposite the apKxoc; represents Arcturus (ApKT-oüpoc;) (cf. 1964:197; Marcovich 2001:338; McKirahan 2010:121n28) and that the Teppara represent its limits of morning and evening, that is, its heliacal and acronychal rising (cf. Hes. Op. 566-67,610). Marcovich 2001: 338 suggests Draco as a candidate. 72 Cf. Aeschin. In Ctes. 165, where "the Bear" is associated with the extent of the oikoumené. 73 In Arist. [Pr.] 26.15.942a4 the "regions of the Bear" are said to be "outside the solstice" (942al), that is, the northern tropic. In Mete. 1.13.350b6-7 Aristotle places the Rhipaean Mountains "under the Bear" (im' aÜTr)v Se tí|v apicrov; cf. Hippoc. Aer. 19 for the region "under the Bears" [Ú7t' avrrfjcn Tflmv apieroim] associated with the Rhipaean Mountains), which is understood by Kiessling 1914: 850.56-58, 851.20-24, 852.22-34 as referring to the fixed arctic circle (cf. the restoration of Aesch. fr. 102 Mette ap. schol.

Ferrari 2008:145-46 with n64 believes that these cardines represent the solstice(s), as cardine Phoebus certainly does in Avienius (Arat. 653-54), but it is more probable that Pliny had the polar axis in mind here.</page><page sequence="19">Crates of Mallos and Pytheas of Massalia 313 that they associated the turning of the sun with the latitude of 54° north; it is more probable to suppose that they—or at least Heraclitus—associated it with the latitude of the fixed arctic circle, even if they did not actually project it onto the terrestrial globe.78 Perhaps Eudoxus originally described the risings and settings of the sun, but he—or Aratus—associated them with the latitude of 54° north, the latitude of the Draco-determined always visible circle, in which they were followed by Crates (for this possible mistake, see below). If we analyze the ideas appearing in the various authors discussed above, it is immediately obvious that they have much in common. They all probably concern the same phenomenon, manifested on various levels: the solstice. It can be elaborated in various ways: the extreme points of the sun's risings and settings on the horizon; its maximum distance from the equator; the longest or shortest day of the year; the increase in the length of day during the summer and decrease during winter in higher latitudes, with a 24-hour day/night at ca. 66°; etc. This maximum declination of the sun can also be defined with its position respective to the sphere of the fixed stars, in particular, circum polar constellations such as Ursa Major and Draco. The latter were not used by Homer in connection with solar motion, but from Heraclitus onwards it was a normal practice to do so. Thus Homer (it could be argued) addressed the concept of the solstice in the Laestrygonian episode with reference to the increasing length of summer days in high latitudes and the almost 24-hour daylight on the summer solstice near the fixed arctic circle, while Heraclitus, on the other hand, focused on the association of the maximum declination of the sun respective to the circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. Eudoxus/ Aratus introduced another circumpolar constellation into the discussion, and it was Crates who finally incorporated all these models into one, albeit arbitrarily and incoherently. This state of affairs is illustrated in Table 1. THE WORLD ACCORDING TO PYTHEAS! THOULÉ The advent of Pytheas into the discussion raises the problem of the location of the island of Thoulé, which he introduced into Greek literature.79 Both Strabo80 and Pliny81 report Pytheas's account of Thoulé as located a six days' 78Marcovich 2001:338 suggests that Heraclitus had the phenomenon of the midnight sun in mind when he described the limits beyond which there is no distinction between the rising and setting of the sun in DK 22B120. 79 For an overview of Pytheas, see Gisinger 1963; Whitaker 1981/82; Roseman 1994; Bianchetti 1998; and Roller 2006: 57-91. 801.4.2 = fr. 6a Mette = fr. 2 Roseman = Eratosth.

Solin. 23 (182, 184 Agnant) mentions a five days and nights' sail from the Orcades, but does not mention Pytheas as his source (the total duration of the voyage from Cape Calydon to Thoulé adds up to fourteen days). Mommsen did not print this section in his edition of Solinus, considering it a much later interpolation, although it appears in some MSS (Mommsen's edition 22.9,1895: 101-2, where he prints only the information on the solstice above Thoulé; printed as an appen dix, 1895: 219, cf. xci). Schol. 147 Descript. ins. aquil. (4.)35 (Waitz 1876: 183) mentions a nine days' sail. Timaeus (FGrHist 566F74 ap.

It was Theodosius of Bithynia (2nd half of the 2nd century b.c.e.) who proved geometrically that at the distance of 66° from the equator—that is, on the fixed arctic circle—the sun does not set on the solstice or, in other words, that an observer situated at the latitude where the summer tropic is the same as the always-visible circle is actually situated on the fixed arctic circle (Aujac 1987b: 168; cf.

We have already seen how the scholiast on Homer associated the location of the land of Laestrygonians with a latitude with the longest day of 23 hours.86 We have also seen that Priscianus Lydus (Solutiones ad Chosroen 4,67.9-15 Bywater = Crates fr. 37b Mette) may have compared the 23-hour day in the north to the situation on Thoulé (although this seems highly unlikely: see Mette 1936: 85 with nl), while the scholiast on Aratus (schol. MDAKVUA Phaen. 62 = fr. 37h Mette),87 among others,88 associated the 20-hour longest day with the island, and Hyginus associated the region under the head of Draco with a shortest night of less than a third of an hour with the Laestrygonians (Poet. astr. 4.3.3 = Crates fr. 37i Mette).89 The idea of a 24-hour solstitial day at Thoulé became something of a commonplace in geographical descriptions of the north. Thus according to Pliny, there is no night on the summer solstice on Thoulé, when the sun passes through Cancer, while on the winter solstice there is no day.90 Pomponius Mela generally de the day at the summer solstice is 30 days long, since he takes the "day" to comprise the interval between the positions of the sun 15° before and after the solstice; Neugebauer 1975b: 757). Euclid, Pytheas's contemporary, had already analyzed the risings and settings of fixed stars on the ecliptic with respect to whether they are observed from a latitude of more than, equal to, or less than 90°-e, discussing the relation of the ecliptic to the arctic (always visible) circles at respective latitudes (Phaen. 4-7; Neugebauer 1975b: 767).

The notion also appears in poetry: Statius associated the "weary sun" with Thyle, which blocks the western waves (Silv. 5.2.54-55), while Dionysius Periegetes and his Latin translators vaguely describe a nightless summer solstice day on the island.93 As we have already seen, this notion of Thoulé was sometimes misunderstood: thus Isidore of Seville, basing his report on that of Solinus, after recounting how the island received its name on account of the fact that the sun "makes" the summer solstice there, claims that there is no light beyond it.94 Bede, as we have already 90.273A]), and Mart.

Compare also Antonius Diogenes (iap. Phot. Bibl. cod. 166,110b42—11 la3) for a six-month night "beyond Thoulé" (Crates fr. 37c Mette).

Thus Procopius describes how in Scandinavia—called Thoulé in this section of his work—the sun is continuously present during the 40 days about the summer solstice, while it is absent for the same amount of time about the winter (Bell. 6.15.6-7). Jordanes repeats the same information about the 40-day daytime and darkness about the solstices (actually, he mentions mid-summer and winter),98 but associates the phenomenon with the Adogit people, who live in the northern part of Scandinavia (Get. 3.19-20). A very similar descrip tion of a 40-day night with the sun in Capricorn and a 40-day daylight with the sun in Cancer is found in Tzetzes (Chiliades 12.844-48, 474 Kiessling), who further associates this region with the Cimmerians (841-43). Paul the Deacon similarly describes a tribe named Scritobini, which is placed by him near the farthest limits of Germania to the northwest (Historia Langobardum 1.4-5), where for several days about the summer solstice there is a clear light during night-time, while about the winter solstice the sun is not seen at all, although there is some light (1.5). Adam of Bremen reports that in Halagland 95 De natura rerum 9 (Migne PL 90.204A; an interpretation, it seems, similar to Isidore's concerning the eternal darkness); In Regum librum XXX quaestiones 25 (Migne PL 91.732B;Trent Foley and Holder 1999: 129-30; Wooding 2000: 241-42; on Thyle [Iceland?] the Sun does not set about the summer solstice); De temporum ratione 31 (Migne PL 90.434-37), where he cites Solinus (22.9) and Pliny (both HN 2.186-87 and 4.104) (Roseman 1994: 78;McCready 1996: 115). 96E.g.,Adam of Bremen, Descript. ins. aquil.

These unusual accounts can be compared with Polybius's description of the sun's behavior around its turning-points, slowing down in approaching the tropics and remaining near them for about 40 days (34.1.9 ap. Gemin. Elem. Astron. 16.34-35,178.6-15 Manitius).100 This means that to an observer it seems as if the sun "slows down" when nearing a solstice, and that it slowly regains its "equinoctial" speed after the turn, appearing as if it "stands still" for a few days about the solstice; this period Polybius approximates to 40 days.101 The sun's "residing" in the far north about the summer solstice could have inspired the theory found in Procopius, Jordanes, and Tzetzes, although Polybius had the area directly "below" the tropics in mind, rather than the area below the arctic and antarctic circles.102 Caesar mentions some unnamed islands around Britain, of which it is written that at the winter solstice the night there lasts for 30 consecutive days (B Gall. 5.13.3), while Plutarch describes an island named Ogygia, situated a five days' sail west of Britain "near the place103 of the summer sunset," where the sun sets "for less than one hour for thirty days in succession" (Defac. 941A, D). Strangely, Posidonius posits two narrow zones directly below the tropics, scorched by the sun (fr. 49 E-K ap. Strabo 2.2.3-3.1.2).104 While only Procopius explicitly connects the scenario of a multi-day daytime with Thoulé, having Scandinavia in mind, and much "Perhaps a mistake for 40 (Nansen 1911:1.194n2). Cf. the anonymous Eulogium his toriarum 4.92 (2.79 Haydon) andRanulph Higden, Polychromcon 1.31 (1.326 Babington), where it is described how in northern parts of Norway the sun does not set for "many" days about the summer solstice and does not rise for "many" days about the winter solstice. Laskaris Kananos claims that at Bergen the uninterrupted daylight lasts from 24 June to 25 July (Lundström 1902: 15; Blomqvist 2002: 46). 100 Cf. a similar description, but without the exact number of days, in Cleomedes, De motu circ. 1.4.35-40,90-92,114-15 Todd. 101 Cf. Gemin. Elem. Astron. 6.29-32, 34-35, 38 (78.25-80.12, 80.18-82.1, 82.7-14 Manitius), 17.28 (190.23-192.3 Manitius). 102 Polyb. 34.1.7-13 ap. Gemin. Elem. Astron. 16.32-38 (176.20-178.28 Manitius). Cf. Pliny, HN 2.13.66, who claims that only the part of the earth that lies beneath (subiaceo) the zodiac is actually habitable, while the rest towards the poles is barren (squaleo), certainly taking antarctic and arctic circles as the boundary lines, not the tropics. 103 Thus Romm 1992:204; Cherniss and Helmbold 1957:181: "in the general direction." 104 Cf. [Hippoc.] De victu 2.38, where it is said that the sun absorbs the moisture of the south wind when it blows "through the approaches (ecpoÖoi) of the sun under the south (imó tt|v |i£0r||ißpir|v)," which probably refers to the tropic of Capricorn.</page><page sequence="25">Crates of Mallos and Pytheas of Massalia 319 later Tzetzes makes a "mythological" reference to the Cimmerians, both Caesar and Plutarch associate the idea with Britain, which suggests, in the light of Pytheas's voyage and report, a link with Thoulé as well. PYTHEAS AND HOMER We can conclude that the location of Thoulé was bound up—from the time of Pytheas onwards—with the concept of the Tponai r|e\ioio (Od. 15.404),105 or was itself considered to lie at the sun's very turning-place, thus earning the name of the "island of the solstice."106 Moreover, Pytheas's report suggests that in his account he combined the actual voyage to whatever place in the "far north" he had visited with a specific Homeric reference. An island of the solstice situated a six days' sail to the north of Britain conforms well with Homer's account in the Odyssey, there we find Aeolus's floating island, situated a six days' sail from Télepylus (Od. 10.80-81)107—where the paths of night and day are close together—and thus of a similar character to the island of Syrié, where the TpoTtat íjeXíoio are located (Od. 15.404).108 Of course, Homer does not in any way connect Syrié with the land of the Laestrygonians, but two pieces of mytho-geographical lore associated with these two locations seem to belong to a similar tradition concerned with meteorological conditions in the far north, or more precisely, on the fixed arctic circle. Hence it seems conceivable that Pytheas was not only a great explorer but perhaps also a fine Homeric scholar. Aujac 1987a: 151 believes that it is probable "that Pytheas indicated the height of the sun at the winter solstice for various latitudes not through observation, but by calculation with the help of geometry."109 105 Cf. Bilic 2012. 106 Cf. Isid. Etym. 14.6.4. Thoulé is rather explicitly associated with the concept of the sun's turning in the poem of Dionysius Periegetes (584-86 [GGM 2.141], cf. Festus Avienius, Descr. orb. terr. 764-67 [GGM2.184]; Eust. Dionys. Per. 581 [GGM2.329.33-37]). 107 With this concept compare similar descriptions in Hes.

Cf. Bilic 2012. 109Cf. Carpenter 1973; 176,191-92 (also cited in Whitaker 1981/82; 160), who claims further that Pytheas derived his values for the length of daylight at various latitudes from</page><page sequence="26">320 Tomislav Bilic He knew beforehand, by studying the geometry of the sphere, of a latitude "where, at the summer solstice, the day lasted twenty-four hours and the sun did not disappear under the horizon. He located the island of Thüle on this particular circle."110 Aujac continues by stating that "he [Pytheas] may have undertaken his voyage to the northern seas partly in order to verify what geometry (or experiments with three-dimensional models) had taught him." Several other authors share this opinion. Thus Bianchetti 1998: 45,155,181 believes that Pytheas's observations actually empirically verified Eudoxus's theoretical exposition of the celestial phenomena—especially the behavior of the sun—in high latitudes.111 Similarly, Dilke 1985: 29-30 (further cited in Roller 2006: 63n52) suggests that the main object of Pytheas's voyage was to obtain the latitudes for the far north, while Heidel 1937: 108 believes that his objective was to gather evidence confirming the sphericity of the earth. Similarly, Roseman 1994: 145 claims that it is "the concept of a spherical earth" Pytheas "is most likely to have set out to demonstrate," since in his time it "was still a theory needing the kinds of data he brought back for its confirmation,"112 while Thomson 1948: 153 maintains he was aware that he was "testing the zone theory." Dicks 1960:187 believes that he "combined trade with scientific exploration,"113 and according to Roseman 1994:148, cf. 155, he was a physical scientist (physikos, philosophos; for the latter, cf. Käppel 2001: 11). It has further been claimed that he was the first to recognize the differ ence between the always-visible and the fixed arctic circle (Bianchetti 1998: calculation—after he had ascertained the latitude through different means—rather than observation. It is probable that he determined the latitudes by observing the elevation of the pole (Nansen 1911:1.46-48; this was one of Hipparchus's procedures, Ptol. Geog. 1.4; Neugebauer 1975b: 938 also argues for the primacy of other means, rather than the longest daylight, of determining geographical coordinates of a locality, namely, observa tions used to determine latitude). 110Cf. Dilke 1985: 30; Bianchetti 1998:191. This was already anticipated by Bunbury 1883:1.614. 111 Cf. Diller 1975: 225, also cited in Roller 2006: 74, where Eudoxus is said to have inspired Pytheas, and Müllenhoff 1870: 1.234-35; cf. Berger 1903: 336; Heidel 1937: 99n212,108; Bianchetti 1998:37, where it is suggested that Pytheas was a pupil of Eudoxus. 112 Cf. Bianchetti 1998: 188, who claims that Pytheas empirically demonstrated the sphericity of the earth. 113 For his dual—scientific and mercantile—motivation, see Bianchetti 1998: 65. Compare also Müllenhoff 1870: 1.312; Tozer 1897: 154; Holmes 1907: 220 (also cited in Whitaker 1981/82:163n90); Nansen 1911:1.45; Walbank 1948:173 (=2002:45) (errone ously cited in Whitaker 1981/82:162);Thomson 1948:143; Cunliffe 2002:154;and Roller 2006:63,74, all of whom emphasize Pytheas's scientific motives in undertaking his voyage.</page><page sequence="27">Crates of Mallos and Pytheas of Massalia 321 43, 153).114 Thus Aujac and others believe that Pytheas's voyage was partly motivated by the wish to gather specific scientific data, while asserting that his data on the altitude of the solstitial sun came through calculation and that he knew of a"Thoulé" before the voyage itself even commenced. This indeed makes the voyage, in terms of theoretical background, superfluous, especially if we take into account the Homeric parallels schematically listed below. Thus Pytheas's voyage was only an empirical confirmation of certain geometrical postulates; he empirically tested the theories concerning the phenomena in high northern latitudes that had already been theoretically predicted by the astronomers,115 combining his actual experience with specific Homeric reference(s) (see Table 2). Table 2. Pytheas Britain Homer Aeolus's island Crates six days' sail to the north six days' sail (unspecified direction) Thoule: perpetual day on the summer solstice the island of the sun's turning Telepylos: the paths of night and day are close together (Syrie) xpoTtai ^eXtoio 54 or 66° N Aeaea 66° S, winter tropic Hades, the Cimmerians south pole 114 For his scientific achievements, see also Bianchetti 1998:45-46 and Käppel 2001:11. 115 Compare what Deinias has to say in Antonius Diogenes's Wonders beyond Thoulé: "Deinias claimed here [beyond Thoulé] to have seen what the devotees of astronomy speculate about, for instance that there are some men who live beneath the Great Bear, and that the night can be a month long, or more or less, or even six months, or even a year." (Phot. Bibl. 166.110b39—11 la2; translation in Romm 1992: 209). Thus Deinias "empirically" tested the theories concerning the phenomena in high northern latitudes that had already been theoretically predicted by the astronomers, which echoes what Pytheas probably also did.</page><page sequence="28">322 Tomislav Bilic If Homeric descriptions are thus an important part of Pytheas's world view, this would also account for the latter's similarities with Crates' account, given that both focus on the exact same data. It is fundamentally Homeric exegesis that we see lurking behind both Pytheas's and, especially, Crates' models, which is not unusual if we take into account the reputation Homer enjoyed during both the Classical and the Hellenistic periods as a true author ity in questions of geography—including mathematical geography. In a way Pytheas actually followed in Odysseus's footsteps, visiting or claiming to have visited a "Télepylos" (perhaps also a "Syrié"), and Crates was free to use the data from both adventurers in elaborating his own ideas of the zonal division of the globe. He perhaps elaborated it in a somewhat incoherent way, locat ing Homer's Laestrygonians both with reference to the always visible circle of Rhodes taken as the arctic circle (misunderstanding or misrepresenting what Eudoxus/Aratus had said with reference to the constellation Draco), and with the latitude of the fixed arctic circle. The former was probably in spired by a cosmological doctrine that demanded the orderly 6-5-4 division of the cosmic sphere. Then again, it is also possible that it was he who was misunderstood or misrepresented by the scholiasts on Aratus; in this case Crates was consistent in associating the Laestrygonians with the latitude of the fixed arctic circle. A third possibility is that Eudoxus originally described the risings and settings of the sun, rather than Draco, but that it was he, rather than Crates, who associated these with the cosmological doctrine described above. Finally, taking into account the common mistakes in the determina tion of Draco's declination (we know of a case when the mistake was as much as 12°), one cannot disregard the possibility of a mistake in Eudoxus's—or, for that matter, Crates'—model, which would account for the difference. It was Crates' model, however, that was depicted on the curious cosmological map discussed above. The question of the variability of the arctic circle was certainly one that Crates considered, although it—or one of the solutions of this problem—was most probably not represented on the map. By contrast, the cosmic (mytho-geographical) nature of Odysseus's voyage,116 associated with the tropics, poles, and arctic circles, is indeed recognizable on the map, which makes it a unique graphic representation of Homeric exegesis. CONCLUSION The two approaches to Homeric exegesis—Crates' and Pytheas's—analyzed in this paper are characterized by their use of mathematical geography in 116Cf. Marinatos 2001; Kappel 2001: 16, 19,21 Abb. 1; Nakassis 2004.</page><page sequence="29">Crates of Mallos and Pytheas of Massalia 323 the service of interpreting the poet's narrative. Crates' interpretative method was quite explicit, as he openly interpreted Homer's narratives as legitimate scientific hypotheses. In this manner he developed a distinctive interpreta tion of Odysseus's voyage, starting in our section of the inhabited earth but ending in the antoikoumené, where Homeric Hades and other otherworldly locations were situated. The map discussed in the text could only have been made in connection with Crates' unique approach to Homeric exegesis, being a graphic representation of his method and a counterpart to his famous globe. It is important to emphasize that both literary and graphic sources attest to an identical concept of the southern hemisphere. The literary sources are in disagreement, however, with respect to Crates' ideas on the question of the fixed arctic circle as opposed to the always-visible, Draco-determined circle for the latitude of Greece. The Draco-determined arctic circle comes in turn to be associated with the question of the northern limit of the habitable zone. Thus, for example, Strabo explicitly associates the limit of the northern habitable zone with the projection onto the terrestrial globe of the always-visible circle as defined by the constellation of Ursa Major. By contrast, in Crates' model the Homeric Laestrygonians were most probably placed on the fixed arctic circle, which defined the northern limit of the habitable zone for Eratosthenes, while Pytheas seems merely to have combined the data acquired on his voy age with certain Homeric references, particularly with those that he believed were concerned with meteorological phenomena in the far north. From the argument above, it seems reasonable to conjecture that Crates used the data he found in Pytheas's account when elaborating his own ideas of mathematical geography. He thus combined the experiences of an imaginary (Odysseus) and a true adventurer (Pytheas). Pytheas's account of the far north and, especially, solar phenomena in high northern latitudes is indeed very similar to certain parts of Homer's narra tive of the Laestrygonians. The reason for this could be simply the fact that Pytheas was inspired by the poet and that he (also) interpreted his narrative as referring to "scientific" hypotheses on solar phenomena in high northern latitudes. It could be argued that he received this notion through the me dium of Eudoxus. Significantly, the constellation of Ursa Major formed the "Homeric" limits of sunrise and sunset already for Heraclitus, in what was a rather explicit allusion to the annual solar motion. In the end, it is impossible to determine who associated the solstitial latitude of the sun with the Draco/ Ursa Major-determined always-visible circle (Heraclitus, Hecataeus, Eudoxus, Aratus, or Crates), but it seems certain that of the notion arose from (at least) two interdependent factors: the latitude of Greece as the determinative for astronomical observations and the orderly 6-5-4 ("Pythagorean") division</page><page sequence="30">324 Tomislav Bilic of the cosmic sphere. In any case, the description of solstitial phenomena could be expressed in several ways: respective to the sphere of the fixed stars or with reference to the increasing length of summer days in high latitudes. The notions of the Laestrygonian "distant gates" and the solstitial island of Thoulé are dependent on both models. WORKS CITED Abel, K. 1974. "Zone." Pauly-Wissowa Supp. 14: 989-1188. Ahmad, S.
