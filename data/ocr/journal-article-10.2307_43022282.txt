My copy was first given to my grand- mother, Grace Phelps, on her birthday in 1901. Within its silky brown cover, embossed with gold letters and black wolves, raven, rabbit, and tracks, I found a treasury of tales of animal adventure, character, and con- sequence. I never doubted the author's first words: "These stories are true." Nor had I any knowledge at that time that the book had lain at the center of an extremely fiery and fascinating episode in American nature writing, one with implications far beyond its own players. Ralph Lutts' s The Nature Fakers: Wildlife , Science , and Sentiment was first published in 1990. The University Press of Virginia is to be com- plimented on bringing this important book back into print. The Nature Fakers is a fascinating telling of the attack by John Burroughs and Theodore Roosevelt on Seton-Thompson (later known as Thompson Seton), William J. Long, Jack London, and other animal-adventure writers, as "sham naturalists." Lutts tells the entire saga in detail and with verve, such that this book reads much more like a page-turner of a narrative history than ecocriticism. Long was the primary target of the famous naturalist and the president; Burroughs and Seton even- tually made up, and London stayed largely out of the fray in spite of his hurt at having been attacked. The antagonists' ire arose from what they saw as gross liberties taken with a factual interpretation of natural acts and outright fabrication. While Long may have been guilty of both, his stories were partly the product of a theology that couldn't admit to the essential indifference of nature. The imbroglio gives Lutts a richly realized opportunity to go well beyond the events themselves, to examine our entire, conflicted array of attitudes toward animals, and to consider the implications they have had for conservation, ani- mal rights, and how we see ourselves. Although Seton's veracity had been the subject of vicious attack, his was some of the first nature writing I was exposed to, along with Thornton W. Burgess's Bedtime Stories , such as Chatterer the Red Squirrel (1915). It seemed to me that these tales made no essential distinction between the motives and actions of animals and those of ourselves.</page><page sequence="3">420 WAL 38.4 WINTER 2004 Only later did I learn that, in most people's minds, "nature" and "people" were two completely different things. Now the boundaries have run together for me again. I believe it can rightly be said that there is no literature other than environmental literature; that there is no nature writing as opposed to other writing. Or rather, it's all nature writing, and the very term "nature writing" is a redundancy. By this I mean that "the environment" is necessarily all-inclusive, and "nature" is universal. In her encyclical poem "The Family Is All There Is" (1994), Pattiann Rogers issues an insouciant dare at the end: "Name something else." It cannot be done. The roots of our environmental crisis undoubtedly lie in the invid- ious attempt to separate humans and human affairs from the rest of nature. The fact that "natural" has come to connote "good" in many well-intentioned people's minds, and the opposite of "man-made," simply plays into the hands of the forces they deplore, for when nature is made something else from culture, it is easy to objectify and to oblit- erate. This is as true in literature as it is on the ground, allowing "nature writing" to be dismissed as a minor genre, of little general interest. When we realize that there is nothing to write about but nature, this false dichotomy begins to break down. Who can read the opening chapter of Thomas Hardy's The Return of the Native (1878), "A Face on Which Time Makes Little Impression," wherein the looming Egdon Heath is introduced before "Humanity Appears on the Scene" in chapter two, and not realize the irreducible fact of landscape-as- character? Yet who today dismisses Hardy as a "nature writer"? like- wise, I contend that Jay Mclnerney's Bright Lights , Big City (1987), as relentlessly urban a human tale as you might find, is a good nature book. It has all the ingredients, after all: the elements (gray city skies), geological substrate (concrete, a complex conglomerate rock created by animals), the animals themselves (human beings, a widespread species of great ape), and lots and lots of plants (genus Coca). Though somewhat impoverished of biotic diversity, the setting is an ecosystem just the same, and the actors, creatures. Of course, we will continue to use the term in more restrictive contexts. There are no good synonyms for "natural area" or "nature reserve." And I don't expect the term "nature writing" to be dropped, when what the speaker really means to describe is writing that attends generously to what poet Pattiann Rogers usefully calls the more-than- human. As David Lodge's character Helen says in his novel Thinks (2001) with reference to a similar dichotomy: "Is this dualism? Well, if making any distinction between mind and body is dualism, then I</page><page sequence="4">Robert Michael Pyle 421 suppose it is, though it seems to me hard to avoid, so deeply is it engrained in our language and habits of thought. Even the fiercest opponents of the ghost in the machine would I think grudgingly allow us to use the terms, mind and body, as long as it was understood that the former is a function of the latter and inseparable from it" (318). This is how I should like to propose that we think of human and nature: the former is a function of the latter and inseparable from it. But we should recognize that there is no real distinction to be made here. Anyone who lays down a line of words to describe any aspect of the physical universe is, perforce, performing nature writing. Therefore, no literature should lie beyond the purview of ecocriticism. Judging from the seven books at hand, the practitioners have been busy figuring this out for themselves. Six of the seven books covered here are in the series Under the Sign of Nature: Explorations in Ecocriticism , from the University Press of Virginia. All of the series' editors and consultants are mainstays in the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment. The seventh title was written by one of those consultants. This might suggest something of a closed shop or a party line, but such is not at all the case. In fact, the bounds of the territory covered and the multiplicity of views presented make a good case for the growing open space and unbounded breadth of the field. As this covey of books suggests, there are no more limits on the amplitude of ecocriticism today than on its geography. While most of these titles impinge directly on the West, their purview extends coast to coast and pole to pole. Likewise for subject matter. Ecocriticism's grasp should follow its reach, and that should have no more limits than ecology itself. Or, as Lawrence Buell defines the bounds in Writing for an Endangered World, , "Any literary transaction between human imagina- tion and material world" is fair game (6). This turns out to be much the point of Karla Armbruster and Kathleen Wallace's anthology. As the authors say in their introduction, "If ecocriticism's level of acceptance within the academy is to continue to grow, we believe ecocritics must make a unified and rigorous effort to demonstrate the field's true range and its power to illuminate an almost endless variety of texts" (3). Acknowledging Cheryll Glotfelty and Harold Fromm's The Ecocriticism Reader: Landmarks in Literary Ecology (1996) as the jump-off point, Armbruster and Wallace insist on the need now for an expansion of the discipline's remit if it is to realize its potential and resist marginalization. Toward that end, they have assembled a bril- liant collection of field-expanding essays addressing biblical, medieval, Enlightenment, and colonial texts; a broad array of African American</page><page sequence="5">422 WAL 38.4 WINTER 2004 writers both rural and urban; literary writers not usually considered nat- uralists; and science fiction, theater, and virtual realms as potential for- aging sources for open-minded ecocritics. Beyond Nature Writing is a sweeping attempt to revision literature of the land through the combined intellects and experience of twenty-two writers, from William C. Home on Samuel Johnson and Greenland to Terrell Dixon on Mary Wilkins Freeman, from Charlotte Zoë Walker on Virginia Wolfe to the editors themselves reconsidering Toni Morrison. What is especially valuable in this grab-bag is the fresh evaluation of voices we thought we knew, as regards the out-of-doors. It is gratifying if not surprising to see Chaucer and Hardy canonized as ecological writers, but who knew that Deuteronomy and Harriet Beecher Stowe might profitably be read in that light? Some of the essays are more convincing than others. Among the most compelling, Glotfelty's "Literary Place Bashing, Test Site Nevada" makes the extremely important point that the way we characterize (or mischaracterize) landscapes can have major repercussions for how we ignore or mistreat them. As I have argued in Wintergreen (1986) and The Thunder Tree (1993), our ecological future owes at least as much to the love of damaged lands as to the protection of conventionally beau- tiful and wild places. Glotfelty goes further by making the provocative point that nature writing and place bashing "are different sides of the same coin, drawing attention to places that may have been better off overlooked" (245). Richard Kerrey on "Ecological Hardy" shows how attention to the "Wessex" novelist and his ilk might "help to produce an ecocriticism (and a nature writing) less preoccupied with deep with- drawal from society" (126). And Michael Branch's "Before Nature Writing" visits the surprising pre-Thoreauvian practitioners and pre- cursors of literary natural history in America, William Wood and Cotton Mather. His journey back through the layers of literature and science and scholarship on which all modern nature writing rests, even unto pre-Iinnaean times, makes for a positively thrilling page of rear-view time-travel. I was less taken with H. Lewis Ulman's investigation of virtual landscapes. He makes a cogent and worthwhile case that cyber- worlds are not the only bogus ones, arguing that the material/virtual dualism is as slippery as that between natural and cultural. Nature writing too, Ulman says, is virtual. But he fails to mention that while most nature writers urge readers to beget themselves outside, the cre- ators of Riven - his realistic cyber-world computer game of choice - seem content to keep players within the scintillating screen; and he never answers the basic question that noninitiates such as I might pose</page><page sequence="6">Robert Michael Pyle 423 to the ersatz worldmakers: "Why?" He claims that "our symbolic representations, if we get them just right, light our way to the thresh- old of the real," but I am left unclear how gaming can improve upon crossing that sill and actually going outdoors (356). Still, Ulman use- fully explores what he calls "the ecotones where our imagination engages the material world," using the same ecological metaphor employed by John Elder in the book's foreword (356). The one book not in the Virginia series, Writing for an Endangered World: Literature , Culture , and Environment in the U.S. and Beyond, by Lawrence Buell, will probably receive the greatest notice of the bunch. Buell is well known as the author of The Environmental Imagination (1995) and for his pioneering work in ecocriticism and Thoreau studies at Harvard. In Writing for an Endangered World , he takes ecocriticism beyond the artificial boundary of the woods by showing the environ- mental imagination at work in both "natural" and built environments. His texts are drawn from a strikingly diverse assemblage of writers including Benjamin Franklin, Mary Austin, Theodore Dreiser, William Faulkner, Aldo Leopold, Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, John Edgar Wideman, Rachel Carson, and Jane Addams. We are not sur- prised to find Austin, Carson, and Leopold here, of course, and Faulkner's attention to the countryside is well known; but bringing in Wideman's place-recovery stories in urban habitats underscores the false dichotomy mentioned above. Buell discusses this "binary naïveté" at some length, contending that "the nature-culture distinction is both a distorting and a necessary lens through which to view both the mod- ernization process and the postmodernist claim that we inhabit a pros- thetic environment, our perception of which is more simulacra-medi- ated than context-responsive" (4, 5). And he thoroughly mix-masters what "place" can mean, questioning every easy definition and limita- tion of the concept. Writing for an Endangered World strides over a vast territory, from the unsuspected common ground between Jane Addam's urban settle- ment house movement and John Muir's wild mountain heights, to the ways that Herman Melville, Victor Scheffer, and Barry Lopez vari- ously approach and "re-negotiate" interspecies boundaries. Buell tra- verses these distances in eight ambitious and deeply textured chapters that confront, in order, the discourse of toxicity, the nature of place, evolving senses of the city, species of determinism, how Faulkner and Leopold meet over environmental ethics, the global commons and large animals, environmental justice for humans and others, and the mean- ings and matter of watersheds. Speaking of "urban ecopoetics from</page><page sequence="7">424 WAL 38.4 WINTER 2004 Dickens to the present," Buell asks, "Will they, will any act of envi- ronmental imagination achieve the kind of hearing an environmen- talist would wish? Make the whole watershed cry out?" He's not sure. "Time will tell. Meantime, far better to hope and venture than forgo the chance" (265). Along the way, many an argument is made, quoted, and examined, to the reader's general enlargement. That said, the book is a dense thicket of a read. The author is fond of words like "platially-centered," "triadic," "ambiguated," "omnivic- timage," "quintessentialize," and "discrepant." The dust jacket blurb promises that "the clarity of the exposition makes the work equally accessible to students and general readers." But not, I'd guess, with sentences like this: "In Soja's pronouncements about urban mega- trends one detects a ludic version of the grand Nietzschean irony that inflects Foucault's discourse of formulations" (58). Such impermeable jargon will not endear the book to thoughtful readers outside the trade, which is too bad, given its important theme, the belief "that reorientation of human attention and values according to a stronger ethic of care for the nonhuman environment would make the world a better place, for humans as well as nonhumans" (6). Buell is a highly engaging speaker, and I would like to see an equally compelling book on his vital concerns really written for the curious reader as opposed to other scholars. As is always a risk in a book marshalling so much material, Buell's details aren't always spot on: he suggests that Terry Tempest Williams's Refuge has imagined a "disaster subculture" into being in the form of her "feminist-survivalist 'Clan of Single-Breasted [sic] Women'" (54). The Williams essay, actually titled "The Clan of the One-Breasted Women," describes Williams's kinswomen who have lost breasts and lives to can- cer. Most of these Mormon women are certainly neither feminists or survivalists, nor even survivors, since most of them have died. Such flubs undermine an otherwise engaging discussion of the toxic environ- ment as a generator of literary rhetoric. But assuming there aren't many of the same, these are minor quibbles for a book that automatically becomes a (not unhopeful) tour de force on the frontier of literature and conservation. Refiguring the Map of Sorrow: Nature Writing and Autobiography by Mark Allister again visits Terry Tempest Williams, as well as Sue Hubbell, Gretei Ehrlich, Peter Matthiessen, Bill Barich, and William Least Heat-Moon. If Buell considers environmental literature as essential to our understanding of the survival of the earth itself, Allister pulls it back into the survival of self. And while there is a strong tincture of the self</page><page sequence="8">Robert Michael Pyle 425 in most nature writing, Reßguring the Map of Sorrow takes the form still deeper into memoir, by asking how nature writing can become "heal- ing autobiographies" and "part of the grieving process" (2). Each of his authors has undergone trauma and mourns through writing. "By writ- ing of a subject that moves them deeply, by working to understand themselves primarily in relation to the nonhuman world around them, they learn ways of responding that teach them how to reenvision their own pasts, which helps them temper their disabling grief" (1). While Allister is interested in the "arc of their mourning," it is the six authors' connection to the natural world that especially catches his attention (2). "Metaphorically," he states, "the author's life is written on the land and all its inhabitants, human, animal, plant, and rock, and by turning terrain into text, geography into consciousness, these writers cre- ate a new and significant kind of life-writing" (3). I'm not sure how "new" it is; surely Gavin Maxwell (best known for his Ring of Bright Water [I960]) does the same in The Rocks Remain (1963) and Raven Seek Thy Brother (1968), whose dedication includes the phrase "For all I loved, and all I grieve" (iv). And Edwin Way Teale and his wife Nellie were surely seeking their way out of sorrow in their nature-travels that became his great American Seasons series, beginning with North vuith the Spring (1951). Though their grieving was decorously invisible, Teale testified that "the spring trip was something we looked forward to dur- ing the terrible years of World War II, during all the strain and grief of losing David, our only son, in battle" (2). But the form has certainly proliferated, and Allister is right to recognize its importance. The author does a serviceable job of describing the grievers' histories as they lead through rustication and reflection to redemption. I am at a loss, however, to understand why he quoted much of Sue Hubbell's set-up for A Country Tear (1986) but omitted her timeless lines that ace exactly how she felt after her divorce: "I had always rather enjoyed having a mind, and I missed mine extravagantly. I was out to lunch for three years" (9). Criticism seems so often to go out of its way to skip the wit; though this might be excused in a book that so doggedly employs the cringey term "grief work." Allister shows just how engagement with the local natural history and beekeeping furnished the texture and nurture that returned Hubbell's equinimity: "fashion(ing) from the natural world a structure that makes a complicated web of daily actions, so that the small things she does are meaningful" (57). He does much the same for the other authors. The discussion of the oft-analyzed Refuge strikes me as more nuanced than many, taking into account the basic humanity of Williams's</page><page sequence="9">426 WAL 38.4 WINTER 2004 contradictions and enigmas of ideology and desire. Barich's journey into horse-racing, Heat-Moon's big road trip, Matthiessen's cat-track through the Himalaya from which he "fashions a text of consolation and compensation to fill the hollow in his heart," and Ehrlich's immer- sion among sheep and sage, all provide Allister with the substrate for his meditations on styles of recovery (144). With the exception of several unhappy discursions into psychoanalysis, some over-familiar quota- tions, and confusion between species and genus when he attempts a biological comparison, Allister manages a useful new look at the wider world as healer. After the multiplicity of views and detached scholarly prose aired in most of these books, it is refreshing to dip into a volume woven by one authoritative, personal, and richly compelling voice. That belongs to Ian Marshall, author of Story Line ,è Exploring the literature of the Appa- lachian Trail Marshall writes, "These are my subject: the literary works set in locales along the Appalachian Trail" (2). He describes the book as more of a literary geography than a literary history. It is also a delightful read in its own right: "There is no better way to see the country than this: to place one foot in front of the other on Springer Mountain, then repeat, about five million times, until you're on top of Katahdin" (4). And this he has done, while contemplating the lit- erature grown from the same territory. In a jacket comment, Scott Slovic calls it "perhaps the best work of ecocriticism that [he's] ever read," and if this is so, it is at least partly due to its gracious language. Any literate through-hiker on the 2,150-mile Appalachian Trail - commonly called the A.T. - would be well advised to pack it along, not something I would suggest to weight-conscious backpackers for a work of literary scholarship. One trait that has come to distinguish certain ecocritics from other kinds of critics has been a willingness to embrace literary writing in the scholarly enterprise. Not that good writing is solely the province of the ecocritics: witness the critical work of Edmund Wilson and John Updike. But in an arena so thick with turgid prose, every exception stands out, and some of the pioneers in the field have made it a tenet to admit fine writing along with rigorous scholarship. Some others, of course, consider this grossly heretical; but they may just be envious. Here, Marshall can deconstruct synecdoche versus symbolism in Robert Frost as an ecological tactic and in the next paragraph pro- ceed thus: "On the third day of my hike I cross Stratton Mountain, see six toads, a spring peeper, and a good-sized garter snake on my way up. ... At Stratton Pond the rain and the black flies struggle for</page><page sequence="10">Robert Michael Pyle 427 control of the atmosphere. . . . The pure, haunting notes of a white- throated sparrow carry across the pond. Birders say that its two-toned call sounds like 'Old Sam Peabody, Peabody, Peabody.' Doesn't sound like that to me. It sounds like, well, a whistle that I can't put into words. If only this page could sing" (190-91). And from there, into the territory of isoalphabetic lines and the anthropomorphic versus the biocentric approach. Marshall defends his personal approach in his introduction, but his frequent excursions into text worth reading for its own sake speak for themselves. As Marshall describes them, the Appalachians are the only American mountains with a literary record from earliest settlement to present. As such, they reflect changing attitudes to the wild and aesthetics, from mercantile/theological to nationalistic to eco-aware. Certainly this old, worn, and long-inhabited range exemplifies the fatuity of the nature-culture dualism. Walking on the Appalachian Trail in Virginia just weeks ago, among the flickering blights of maple leaves and American copper butterflies, I noticed a stone wall built onto a rock outcrop. Moss and erosion had so blurred the boundary between the wall and the rock that it was almost impossible to say where the anthropogenic ended and the geologic began. Few land- scapes make the case I began with better than this one, and many of the writers that Marshall attends to further muddy the smear. These include James Mooney retelling Cherokee myths, William Bartram, Mary Murfree, Horace Kephart, and Annie Dillard, as well as Jeffer- son, Melville, Hawthorne, Thoreau, Whitman, Frost, Ginsberg, and several earlier, lesser known writers. Story Line is no anthology, and the author's own experience and analysis breaks up the readings. But we get enough of each of the orig- inal sources to make us feel as if we have trod their particular corner of the Appalachians, in their company, and to have a sense of their stories. So in Marshall's chapter "Pilgrim at Tinker Cliffs," written from the heights above the famous creek, Dillard has enough to say that we can hear her down below. But Marshall also quotes a young woman, Dillard-inspired and trail-named Thistle. Through her ingen- uous note left in a trail register for him, we sense as much of the place and the writer in question as we do from Dillard's own text and the critic's response. Similarly, it takes an impromptu round-robin read- ing of "Howl" with other hikers in a trailside shelter to show Marsali how Whitman and Ginsberg really were kindred spirits, though the one gloried in the open road while the other found anguish in open space. The sections of Horace Kephart, Jefferson, and Thoreau are</page><page sequence="11">428 WAL 38.4 WINTER 2004 engaging, as is Marshall's version of the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe. The writers and their texts are well chosen to illuminate the landscape and reflect on one ¿mother. Of course, many Appalachian scribes are necessarily left out Marshall mentions the absence of Davy Crockett, Sydney Lanier, David Middle- ton, and Edward Hoagland, for example. Charles Fraser's Cold Mountain (1997) and Barbara Kingsolver's Prodigal Summer (2000), both extraordi- narily rich in their natural history, would have given the book a more contemporary resonance. Another obvious elision is Bill Bryson's Into the Woods (1998) - and that's too bad, because it will have had more readers than most of the considered titles put together. And while Bry- son's witty romp might be considered too light for serious considera- tion among this distinguished company, the element of humor is far too often absent from ecocriticism, as noted above. I wonder if any of the authors Marshall did discuss managed to capture the crazy mix of grandeur and grind the A. T. can be, as well as Bryson did between the yucks. Not that Story Lme is without humor, whether in Hawthorne's Ichabod Pigsnort or the author's trollish encounter with littering teen- agers. The book is actually fun to read, perhaps an indictment in some quarters. If one Bryson is missing here, another makes a strong appearance: Michael A. Bryson's Visions of the Land: Science , literature , and the American Environment from the Era of Exploration to the Age of Ecology. This ambitious book investigates the fundamental relations between science, the nat- ural world, and human community. The author calls it "a meditation on the capacity of using science to live well within nature" (ix). Bryson essays this by examining the diverse writings of Captain Frémont, Admiral Byrd, Major Powell, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Susan Cooper, Rachel Carson, and Loren Eiseley. Most of these actually worked as explorers and/or scientists, yet left behind luminous - sometimes even numinous - prose, as well as reports, surveys, monographs, and research papers. The others were writers and naturalists concerned with ques- tions of science. At least the last two knew the "high ridge" that Nabo- kov proposed, "where the mountainside of 'scientific' knowledge joins the opposite slope of 'artistic' imagination" (Boyd and Pyle 71). Bryson casts his net in three parts. In the first, "Narratives of Exploration and the Scientist-Hero," John Charles Frémont investigates the West while forging a masculine persona and rhetoric that the author describes as "an amalgam of Thomas Jefferson, Daniel Boone, and Natty Bumpo" (6). Bryson calls Frémont "the glamour boy of America's westward expansion, according to standard histories celebrating the</page><page sequence="12">Robert Michael Pyle 429 imperial march of white civilization," who rendered the land as "an object to be studied, catalogued, and mapped" (6, 31). The author's view of Frémont, while recognizing his contributions, is highly gendered. The explorer's writing is seen as erotically charged with the masculine pene- tration of a virginal, female nature. Richard Byrd's Thoreauvian exper- iment in salutary solitude in the Antarctic, failed as it was, provides Bryson with a very different model of the explorer-hero. While not un- gendered, his account avoids "Fremont's fantasies of conquest" and mas- culine excesses (44). His quiet contemplation and observation arrive at a much more harmonious view of nature than Fremont's, but this is ulti- mately subverted by practical difficulties and near disaster. In the end he becomes a debilitated servant to his own instruments, and the glamorous science of exploration takes a serious hit. Part Two, "Imagined Communities and the Scientific Management of Nature," invokes two texts that seem wildly disparate in service of the same conclusion: Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Utopian fable Herland (1915) and John Wesley Powell's Report on the Lands of the Arid Region (1878). Gilman's novel involves a modern population of Amazons, a parthenogenetic nation of women who have perfected agriculture and civilization in a limited realm and have not known criminality for six hundred years. Found out by a trio of would-be Shangri-La explorers, the women detain their visitors and reveal their ways through con- versations with them. The male-dominance ethos is turned on its head and satirized. In Powell's report - less literary, but in Bryson's view more fascinating than Powell's more commonly quoted Canyons of the Cobrado (1895) - both the challenges and opportunities of the Great American Desert are laid out in precise, but often speculative and sometimes contradictory, terms. In the end, these works turn out to have more in common than anyone might guess: the functioning utopias imagined in each rest upon communitarian rather than individual values, and both visions rely upon a deep and abiding faith in applied science to manage nature and realize their desired conditions. The women of Herland control population through a kind of "reverse eugenics" and eliminate competing species scientifically. Powell's ideal West would enshrine and entrust science to dam, divert, store, and distribute water, but with social restraints and the distinct limits of the landscape well in mind and practice. The science has been applied, but the limits have not been observed, and I for one believe Powell would be appalled at the result - not least at the silting, canyon-drowning reservoir created in his name. Both authors begin to anticipate an ecocentric way, but</page><page sequence="13">430 WAL 38.4 WINTER 2004 still place their trust in science to a fault. Bryson's Part Three considers "Nature's Identity and the Critique of Science" through the writings of ruralist Susan Fenimore Cooper and scientists Rachel Carson and Loren Eiseley. These sources are too rich to touch on with any depth here. They cohere in how they all pull back from the explorer-dominant model and the ultimate faith in science to correct all ills and craft the perfect human setting. Indeed, to Cooper, the semi-cultivated New York State countryside she doc- uments in Rural Hours (1850) is already the near-perfected setting. For her, science properly involves the observation, contemplation, and con- servation of birds, plants, and other diverse elements of the commu- nity, more than their subordination and control, or, as the author puts it, "a system of study meant to foster moral and intellectual connec- tions between the observer and the outside world" (133). Finally, then, Bryson considers Carson and Eiseley, two giants in whom Cooper's anticipation of a humbler, more attentive science was practically apotheosized. As Bryson has it, "In America, a select few individuals have played key roles in both the communication of sci- entific knowledge to a general audience and the shaping of our environ- mental attitudes; their efforts represent one path toward a reconciliation between scientific and technological innovation and environmental consciousness-raising" (135). Carson and Eiseley head the list and "offer artistically sophisticated environmental critiques of science, . . . study nature with respect and care, and proffer science not as the ulti- mate instrument of human domination of nature but as the means to achieving a new environmental ethic" (136). Gendered nature and myths of conquest and control are, for the most part, left far behind. But these exemplars hardly reject science: they are, after all, scientists. Carson, even as she excoriates the amoral chemical industry, "never doubts the value of science done thoroughly, ethically, and without outside influence, and she retains faith in the solidity of fact, the accu- mulation of data, the imposition of order through theory and inter- pretation" (160). Eiseley too loves pure science, but he qualifies his enthusiasm (having lived longer and seen the seas themselves defiled, something Carson thought impossible), seeing Homo sapiens ultimately as a "planet virus" and a "world eater" (169). Carson and Eiseley took the best of what went before in literary science, went further, and added humility. As a several-pronged look at writers and science, Visions of the Land marries well with Robert Bernard Hass's Going by Contraries : Robert Frosťs Conflict with Science. The author maintains that Frost's challenge</page><page sequence="14">Robert Michael Pyle 431 was to restore an emotional and intellectual balance - a "convincing intellectual authority" - to "a cultural medium whose authority had been usurped by a scientific world view" (11). At first highly suspi- cious, Frost later came to a rapprochement, writing "(science) can't go too far or too deep for me"; but he wavered, also calling science "a complacent ministry of fear" (16, 18). In the end, he equated science with poetry, not unlike Nabokov's "the Precision of Poetry, the Excite- ment of Science" (Boyd and Pyle 70). Hass contends that when Frost figured out science's fallibility and that it could not disprove his own eclectic spiritual faith, he relaxed about it and could embrace the pri- macy of experience (so obvious in his countryside poems) while over- coming his fear of materialism. Though Frost never quite reconciled Darwin, he accepted scientific paradox. Thus Hass sees Frost as the perfect vehicle between the past and the modern. Professor Charles Lee Remington, a Yale University biologist, used to visit periodically with Robert Frost in the 1950s and early 1960s, as cofellows of Yale's Pierson College. Frost evinced great curiosity about Remington's genetic research with butterflies, and at gatherings, Re- mington told me, "he would come over to ask me what was new and interesting." Frost also visited Remington's laboratory to see specimens for himself. When I queried Remington as to whether Frost struck him as conflicted over science, Remington told me that he detected no antagonism, but rather he thought Frost was easily bored by puffed-up scientists. Remington found the poet keenly interested in living things but thought Frost considered it pretentious for a person of his knowl- edge and enthusiasm to use the word "science" when what he really meant was "natural history." "Robert Frost could be considered an eco- logical poet," Remington said, " but he would not have used that term." Hass relies perhaps too much on Frost's supposed familiarity with and dependence on the writings of Henri Bergson, who maintained that science gave no true, immutable laws but rather imposed reduc- tionist and deterministic models. He calls Bergson one of "Frost's most important intellectual mentors" while admitting that "no definitive evidence exists that Frost ever read Time and Free Will" one of Berg- son's most important texts (6-7). Bergson's influence arises through- out this book, leaving one to conclude that the present author may have been more affected by him than his subject was. Then, too, author Hass does not reveal himself to be the equal of his namesake, the former poet laureate, as a naturalist; nor of the poet under study. For example, analyzing Frost's poem "Design," Hass says that the phrase "A snow-drop spider" compares the spider to "a piece of candy"</page><page sequence="15">432 WAL 38.4 WINTER 2004 instead of the obvious spring flower (61). He misses the acutely accurate behavior of the Spring Azure rendered in Frost's poem "Blue Butterfly Day," bizarrely calling it a mere record of "life's fragility . . . bordering on melodrama and sentimentality" (64). And he makes a hash of the adaptive value of wing coloration in "To a Moth Seen in Winter," conflating crypsis with "sexual selection" (66). The author undersells the deep importance of natural features to his poet, who wonders who the moth might be, "If I had moths to friend as I have flowers" - anticipating Gary Snyder's first lines in "What You Should Know to Be a Poet": "all you can about animals as persons / the names of trees and flowers and weeds" (40). In fact, Ian Marshall's investiga- tion of Frost's collection "New Hampshire" in Story Line told me more about Frost the naturalist/poet than many of Hass's dissections, which sometimes seem labored, freighted, and heavily speculative. Nonethe- less, Going by Contraries does good service toward understanding a pow- erfully earth-borne poet's connection to the living, physical world and the science that seeks to bind it. In many ways, Frost's internal conflicts over science (at least, as interpreted by Hass) seem to reflect the contemporary argument be- tween E. O. Wilson in Consdlimce (1998) and Wendell Berry's counter- blast in Life Is a Miracle (2000). Wilson argues that, in time, science and humanities will coalesce in their skills and enterprise such that all things might be understood. Ignoring Wilson's insistence on responsibility, Berry rejects this brand of logical materialism as hubristic, reduction- ist, and dangerous. I'm not convinced that they share sufficient lan- guage, knowledge, and (especially) assumptions to fully apprehend one another's intentions, any more than Burroughs and Long did during their "nature fakers" argument. But I wonder how Robert Frost would come down, having finally made his peace with science. He might be just the person to ask, with reference to such concerns, since he serves as a common element to at least four of the books under considera- tion here. Besides Hass, Kent Ryden (in Beyond Nature Writing writes that "Frost developed a version of nature poetry that was true to the place he lived, a place where notions of nature and culture were inex- tricable" (310). John Elder, in the same book, says that "pale orchises and bright green snakes are the Tacts' that Frost labors to encompass in his verse, along with the ecosystem and the agricultural economy in which they would likely be encountered" (319). And Ian Marshall in Story Line insists that "the point of a Frost poem is not primarily a moral lesson about human existence but a 'larger' observation about all of existence, all of life, where nonhuman and human life, the physical and</page><page sequence="16">Robert Michael Pyle 433 the metaphysical realms, are all part of a whole called nature" (190). How little the direct knowledge of nature enters into contempo- rary discourse! How poorly we know the plants and animals around us. Robert Frost was clearly an exception. Like William Stafford's, his poems (such as "Blueberries" [1969]) have been incorporated on inter- pretive signs in national forests. This points out a big difference between so-called nature writers and their explicators: many ecocritics, as well as "deep ecologists" and ecological activists, have little if any actual knowledge of ecology and its working parts. I am often bemused by fliers for "Deep Ecology workshops" in which neither the program nor the conveners seem to have any actual involvement with flora and fauna. How can one relate deeply to ecology, let alone teach such a relationship, in the absence of intimacy with the ecological players? How can one criticize the literature of the land without having some first-hand acquaintance with the land's working parts? In the novel Daniel Martin (1973), a John Fowles character tellingly asks, "Why isn't it enough that I just love it here? That I don't want to know all the names and the frightfully scientific words." The title character answers, "Because you shouldn't justify contempt in igno- rance. In anything" (350). This exactly characterizes the reaction of many people who, sensing they will never be able to master the names of all the plants and animals around them, decide to ignore them all. I'm afraid that many critics may be not far off this stance, a maladap- tive one, to be sure, for anyone concerned with a subject bounded by the diversity of life. "Though I am no scientist, I am curious about how the world works" (6). So wrote Ian Marshall, who actually went out and wrote what he found in Time Une. In doing so, he followed Scott Slovic's 1994 injunction for ecocritics to "encounter the world and literature together, then report about the conjunction" (7). Marshall continues, "To be aware of our role not just as observer but as participant, as part and parcel of the world, is a healthy attitude to apply not just to studies of the natural world but to explorations of the literary world as well" (8). Just so. And this is where we came in, with the nature fakers. Being personal and rigorous is the challenge. The solution lies in embracing the details of the land, rejecting contemptuous igno- rance, and recognizing that meaningful comment about our own con- dition requires attention to our more-than-human neighbors, and to our neighborhood itself.</page><page sequence="17">434 WAL 38.4 WINTER 2004 Works Cited Berry, Wendell.
