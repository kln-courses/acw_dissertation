<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SIROHI RĀGAMĀLĀS: AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY Elena Preda University of Bologna The Rãgamãlã, 'Garland of Melodies' or 'Garland of Musical Modes', represents one of the main subjects produced by the Indian schools of painting and, in particular, by the Rājasthānī tradition. Between the 16th century and the end of the 19th century the rãgamãlã subject was produced by all the Indian schools of painting according to the various regional styles. The rãgamãlã paintings were created in series usually composed by thirty-six or forty-two paintings. Though most of the Rājasthānī schools of paint- ing adhered to the mainstream Rājasthānī Tradition (Painters System), employing a specific iconography connected to a certain rãga or rāginī, variants can be detected. At a first glance, some variants could be perceived as misinterpretations of the conven- tional pictorial formulas of a certain subject on the part of the artists but, at a deeper investigation, they result as peculiar production of local traditions, developed or em- ployed by a particular school of painting. Sirohi is known for its particularly vivid and colourful rãgamãlã series produced during the last quarter of the 17th century. At pres- ent, complete series are very rare but numerous are the single paintings, or small groups of three or four paintings belonging to the same series, kept in public and pri- vate collections around the world. The Sirohi rãgamãlã iconography belongs to the Rā- jasthānī Tradition, though the artists employed some unique iconographie formulas found only in the Sirohi rãgamãlã s. The group of thirteen Sirohi paintings discussed and analysed in the present paper, forming a set belonging to one rãgamãlã series, has never been studied and reproduced, and thus represent a significant discovery which increases the quantity, and the variety, of material produced by Sirohi painters avail- able for scholarly investigation. The set present of paintings paper belonging is a preliminary to a Sirohi investigation rãgamãlã tradition. on a recently The discovered Rãgamãlã set of paintings belonging to a Sirohi rãgamãlã tradition. The Rãgamãlã , 'Garland of Melodies' or 'Garland of Musical Modes;, represents one of the main subjects produced by the Indian schools of painting and, in particular, by the Rājasthānī tradition. These series of paintings are considered pictorial representations or "visual interpretations of Indian musical modes previous- ly envisioned in divine or human form by musician and poets".1 The paintings are named after the traditional classification of musical modes in Indian Music: every single painting is labelled with the name of the corresponding musical mode and numbered accordingly, then paintings are assembled in albums and arranged as the 'garland of musical modes'.

Between the 16th century and the end of the 19th century the rãgamãlã sub- ject was very popular and produced by all the Indian schools of painting ac- cording to the various regional styles. At present, among the four main icono- graphie traditions,3 the Rājasthānī Tradition is regarded to be the earliest and the most productive. In addition, although the majority of the Rājasthānī schools of painting adhered to the mainstream Rājasthānī Tradition, em- ploying a specific iconography connected to a certain rãga or rāginī, variants can be detected in some periods or in some regional styles. The rãgamãlã paintings were created in series; they were arranged in "fam- ilies" (usually six in number). Each "family" included a rãga (male), and each rãga had five rāginī s (females, conceived as wives), making a complete series of thirty-six themes. This was the classification according to the Painters Sys- tem4 commonly used by the Rājasthānī Tradition, even though it is possible to find some variant with six rāginīs that brings the total number of paintings to forty-two. Other systems included a certain number of sons, daughters and son's wives, increasing considerably the number of the paintings in a series. This is the case, for example, of the Mesakarna's System5 which lists six rãgas , thir- ty-one rāginīs and 49 putras (sons). Such a classification was widely employed by the artists of the Pahari schools of painting, while it was rarely used by the Rājasthānī painters who preferred to follow the Painters System. Some attempts have been made to trace the origin of the iconography of single rãgas and rāginīs , though their origin remains obscure.6 Besides, the complex connection of music, poetry and painting makes the Rãgamãlã a sub- ject very complex and difficult to explore in all its aspects. Sirohi, a small principality in the Southwest part of Rajasthan, is known for its particularly vivid and colourful paintings. The Sirohi rãgamãlã iconogra- phy belongs to the Rājasthānī Tradition, though the artists employed some unique iconographie formulas found only in the Sirohi rãgamãlãs.

Sangram Singh of Nawalgarh),7 a set of thirteen paintings kept in the same collection,8 and few smaller sets and several single paintings belonging to different (more or less a dozen) series scattered all over the world in private and public collections.9 On the basis of the available Sirohi rãgamãlãs the general consensus is that this school of painting produced "very pretty and colorful"10 rãgamãlã series during the last quarter of the 17th century. Now we know that this school of painting was active for almost two cen- turies between the beginning of the 17th and the end of the 18th century,11 though rãgamãlã paintings seem to flourish only during a short period of time at the end of the 17th century, whereas this form of art was well established in other schools of painting in Rajasthan long before then and continued for centuries. The Sirohi rãgamãlãs seem to appear suddenly in the production of this pictorial tradition when it was at its finest. In fact, the surviving examples show mature and developed compositions, executed with an extremely pre- cise technique that, together with the brilliant colours employed, offers pow- erful representations and makes this type of paintings easy to recognise. Sirohi painting, and in particular the rãgamãlãs production, is generally known for modelling the characters with darker shading along the outlines to emphasize shapes, for the richly, for the use of simple iconographies mounted on richly detailed and luxurious architectures and for the large red borders framing the paintings. Distinctive is also the use of a specific palette of brilliant colours, with a preference for red, yellow, orange and white pig- ments, that applied in thick layers of saturated colours create an enamel-like texture The group of thirteen Sirohi paintings discussed and analysed in the pres- ent paper, forming a set belonging to one rãgamãlã series, has never been studied and reproduced, and thus represents a valuable addition which in- creases substantially the quantity of material produced by Sirohi painters 7 Ebeling refers to the fact that there might be another entire Sirohi ragamala in the Art Collection, Kankroli, but he does not confirm this information.

This preliminary examination therefore presents six images coming from the Sirohi rãgamãlã set and in turn discuss- es the most important aspects related to the legacy of the Sirohi rãgamãlã paintings within the mainstream Rājasthānī Tradition. The paintings, which may be dated at 1680 A.D. ca., present the large red border typical of the Sirohi school. Also, the four corners of the pictures' frames show many small holes probably caused by the insects that ate the or- ganic glue employed for hanging the paintings. However, the paintings' con- dition is generally good except for some light cracks and minor flaking of the pigments in very limited areas. The paintings show the traditional vibrant palette dominated by red, white and yellow but completed by pink, green, blue, brown and gold, displaying the Sirohi style at its finest. The majority of the known Sirohi rãgamãlã paintings have their name or ti- tle inscribed with black ink in the topside of the red band surrounding the scene. But in this newly discovered set there is no script on the surface of the paintings, as they are all labelled on the reverse. In some cases the text iden- tifies the illustrated subject and it also includes a number, while in some oth- ers there are a few lines of text in addition to the name and number. Unfortunately, there is no space here to discuss all these aspects in details, but a further investigation including the remaining paintings and the texts will be published in the near future. The first painting is the image of Kedãra which usually involves the figure of an ascetic and music as key elements of the composition, but the possible combinations of these elements in rãgamãlã paintings is surprisingly wide and can differ consistently from school to school. The Sirohi artists represented this subject with a local iconographie con- vention: sitting on a terrace of a highly decorated palace are a woman and, in front of her, an ascetic male figure seated next to a tall tree; they are involved in conversation and are both holding in their hands pan leaves which they are most likely about to share (Fig. 1). The status of ascetic, renouncing the world, of the male figure is indicated by his matted locks, and by his ash- smeared and semi-nude body (Figs. 1, 1b).12 Another Kedãra from Sirohi, from the Alvin O. Bellak collection,13 shows a composition very similar to the painting in Figure 1, but differently in this representation the lady is offering to the man a garland of white flowers in lieu of pan leaves. The pet deer (two in Fig. 1) resting in the foreground and the differently shaped vases and jars 12 This painting belongs to the G. Bickford Collection, Cleveland Museum of Art, published in K.

All of them employ a complex scheme of bright colours in sharp con- trast and any reference to the music is totally absent in these paintings. So, the Kedãra painting presented here (Fig. 1) adheres to the local standard iconog- raphy (Fig. lb) rather than following the Rājasthānī Tradition. In fact, the ab- sence of any link to music, also in Figure 1, suggests that the omission was a peculiarity of the Sirohi iconography: the artists probably developed their own formula to represent Kedãra rãgas. In our group of paintings there is also a Sãrang rãga (Fig. 2), as identified by the text on the verso of the folio; the image can be compared to another piece kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (Fig. 2b).14 In both cases there is a huge ascetic male figure seated on a rock next to a tree; at the centre of the scene two deer are running toward the holy man, while a young disciple is approaching; the men hold leaves in their hands which are used by the ascetics to feed the animals. Apart from the natural elements of rocks and tree, the scene is set in a courtly location. The main difference between the two iconographies is the colour of the beard of the ascetic figure, in Figure 2 is black while in Figure 2b is white, denoting an elderly man. A further Sãrang rãga from Sirohi is discussed by Beach15 and it shows great similarities to the above discussed examples: in this painting the men carry sprigs of grass in their hands instead of wide leaves to feed the animals (Figs. 2, 2b); the holy man is white-bearded and the scene is, as Beach states, "a bril- liant and powerful image".16 This iconography of Sãrang rãga is very rare and Ebeling, in his unequalled work on Ragamala, could not determine, due to the scarcity of comparative material, whether Kedãra and Sãrang "are interchangeable names for the same iconography or whether they are separate but similar".17 Strikingly, in the present set there are both Kedãra and Sãrang and they belong to the same rãgamãlã series (Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore, apparently the presence of both themes in the same series seems to support the idea that Kedãra and Sãrang are distinct iconographies for different subjects, though they show some similarities. The iconography of Desãkh rãga visible in Fig. 3 adheres perfectly to the Rājasthānī tradition: the Desakh is the only sport theme and it usually repre- sents some sort of physically challenging exercises, typically some acrobatic pursuits, as in this case. Traditionally, among the acrobats engaged in various activities, the central character is a female figure climbing a pole. The Sirohi 14 Published in K.

Here we would also like to shed light on the particular way the Sirohi artists developed some themes of the Rājasthānī Tradition according to local taste or imagery. As mentioned above, it is quite common to several regional styles to develop variants but the Sirohi rãgamãlã s show distinctive methods and themes to link painted subjects to iconographies belonging to the Sirohi painting tradition. One of the best examples is represented by the Sirohi de- piction of 'women eating pan as key element of the scene. When Ebeling first studied the available Sirohi paintings he compared two of them: both depicted ladies sharing pan but they differed in name;19 to 18 Other two examples of Desākh rāgas are known: one is published in K. Ebeling, op. cit., p. 63 be- longed to the J. P. Goenka Collection; the other is published in P. Pal, The Classical Tradition in Rajput Paintingfrom the Paul F. Walter Collection, New York, Pierpont Library and the Gallery Association of New York State, 1978, p. 83, cat. no. 18; this painting was presented as lot no. 27 at the Sotheby's auction in New York, November 14, 2002. In both pictures the central male figure is climbing the pole upside down. 19 One is a Gunakali rāginī (inscribed Gunakañ on the top), from the Cleveland Museum of Art (Acc.

Due to the limited material he could not be conclusive about this issue. Later, Leach compared one more Madhumādhavl rāginī painting kept in The Art Institute of Chicago,20 to the Gunakali rāginī of the Cleveland Muse- um. She considered the Madhumādhavl paintings a deviant formula of the 'women eating pan Sirohi variant, and she pointed out that those two paint- ings "that are almost identical to the Cleveland miniature yet labelled Mad- humadhavi Ragini indicate the confusion and overlapping in the short Sirohi tradition'.21 Both the Madhumādhavl rāginī s show an opulent pavilion and a tall tree as setting for the central iconography of four ladies: two seated next to each oth- er on the left hand-side, near the tree, receiving something from an ap- proaching lady in the centre, while the fourth woman is leaning against a cushion on the opposite side of the scene. The main difference between these paintings is that the lady in the centre is carrying a garland of white flowers in the painting of Chicago, while in the other one, also known by Ebeling, the ladies are handling some leaves (probably pan). In addition, some decorative elements such as the different shape of the pavilions, and the peacock aloft the tree in the example from Chicago, distinguish the two paintings. The Gunakali rāginī , instead, shows only a richly elaborated part of a palace with three ladies seated on a terrace with pan leaves in their hands, and it is almost identical to the painting in our set (Fig. 4) which is labelled Gujan. We may thus assume that these two paintings portray the same subject with mis- written names. Furthermore, it seems clear that the Madhumādhavl rāginīs de- pict a specific iconography, not as a variation of the iconography illustrated in Figure 4, but as a local visual interpretation of the Madhumādhavl theme. In the Rājasthānī Tradition both Gunakali and Madhumādhavl are usually characterized by a lovesick woman who conveys a sense of longing for the absent lover. Conversely, the Sirohi version of those subjects depicts a pleas- ant time-passing activity such as sharing pan with friends. A scene that is in- deed considerably different from the mainstream tradition. According to Leach: "it can be assumed that the failure to produce a correctly evocative at- mosphere was caused by the Sirohi artists' lack of knowledge or by the desire to produce simple and pleasing decorative compositions/'22 This newly discovered set confirms the use of those pictorial formulas by the Sirohi painters who executed them with full technical and stylistic ability. Consequently, we can now assert that a certain iconography was probably perceived as evocative of a specific emotion and this because the iconography 20 Acc. no. 61.122, and published in L. Y.

In the case of subject in Figure 4, the variant is not just represented by a partial adaptation of a standard composition (like in the case of Kedāra rūga), but it results in a totally unique iconography, developed by local artists, which in turn became a convention within the local tradition. Perhaps the artists tried to create a formal connection to the mainstream tradition by naming the paintings after the musical modes listed by the Rājasthānī Tradition. In Figure 5 the lady, twisting her body, raises her arms overhead showing in this way a distinctive element of the iconography of Desvaran rāginī, while the lady holding the mirror is a local addition.23 Also, the regular white dots in the light blue sky, and a white crescent moon in the top left corner of the painting, indicate the late evening time of the day. According to Ebeling, "Desvarari, as musical mode, became extinct some- time in the 17th or 18th century. To be up to date, painters in several schools re- placed the name with that of a locally popular raga, but they retained the iconography. Thus, in Sirohi it was called BEHAG".24 23 K.

The Desvaran raginī illustrated in Ebeling shows a setting very similar to the painting in Figure 5 though the scene takes place during the day as indi- cated by an anthropomorphic sun in the top left corner of the painting, and by a canopy hanged between the palace and the tree. In addition, the first female attendant from the left is feeding a peacock perched in the blooming tree instead of bearing a whisk as in Figure 5. Apart from the different day- time and different decorative elements the central iconography is generally respected by the artists who labelled the paintings with the same name. The Vilaval raginī theme (Fig. 6) is developed in accordance to the main- stream traditional iconography: a lady usually shown while arranging her earrings, is looking into a mirror held by an attendant. It is traditionally linked to a morning melody and it expresses amorous expectation. The Devanāgarī script on the reverse of the illustration labels the painting as Vilãval rãga. The scene takes place in a palace-like house, the lady is sitting on a terrace outside a domed portion of the building, from where a canopy has been hanged to protect the ladies from the sun (the blue sky indicates a clear sunny day). In this depiction, the attendant holding the mirror is sitting in front of the lady and another female attendant is standing on the right next to a tall tree carrying a tray with two yellow bottles, perhaps with precious cosmetic oils, perfumes or rose water.</page><page sequence="12">382 ELENA PREDA [l2] Fig. 6. Vilaval raga , Sirohi, ca. 1680, private collection. The artist employs brilliant colours such as yellow, red, blue and green in rendering the saris, the cushions and the canopy, all decorated with patterns of leaves, flowers and creepers. For comparison, one can look at the Sirohi Vilaval rāginī from the Metro- politan Museum in New York:25 here the standing attendant is bearing a pea- cock fan, the tree and the canopy are absent but the time of the day is indi- cated by an anthropomorphic sun in the blue sky at the top of the scene. Both paintings employ the same iconography of the lady adjusting the earrings while looking into a mirror. The remaining seven paintings from the set, not illustrated here, are: Malkoś ( Mālakausīka ), Lolita , Vibhãsã, Bangālī, Bhairav (?), Gandhań and Maru (?). The text on the back of the paintings vaguely employs the word rãga show- ing an apparent lack of interest in the basic classification of the themes as masculine (rãga) and feminine (rāginī). To sum up, the new material available discussed above seem to support the idea that Sirohi painters did not adhere entirely to the Rājasthānī tradition in composing their rãgamãlãs, but they coherently applied their own and local- ly developed pictorial formulas to depict some of the subjects of the rãgamãlã theme. As mentioned above, mislabelling is rather common: the artists seem 25 Acc. No. 1985.398.11.

Whether this was due to a lack of confidence, by the Sirohi artists,26 or to a reinterpretation of themes linked to a local imagery remains yet to be deter- mined. It could be assumed that the repetition of certain iconographie formulas and the vividly developed sceneries suggest that the Sirohi visual interpreta- tion of the musical modes was probably appreciated with or without a strong connection with music and poetry. We can thus suggest that a conventional evocation of certain atmospheres by means of certain images was codified, and it was immediately understood by painters and viewers alike, as part of a local tradition. Although this recently identified set deserves further investigations, in- cluding an accurate study of the texts, we can strongly confirm that this new pictorial evidence throws new light on the Sirohi rãgamãlãs strikingly in- creasing our knowledge of the Sirohi School of painting. 26 For further discussion see, L.
