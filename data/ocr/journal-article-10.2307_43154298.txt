ZOOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY &amp; PHILOSOPHICAL ETHOLOGY One of the important and influential works of Chevalier de Lamarck (1744- 1829) was his Philosophique zoologique , published in 2 volumes in Paris, 1809-30. (It was translated into English by H. Elliot as Zoological Philosophy , London 1914). By zoological philosophy Lamarck meant the systematic sci- ence of animals as contrasted with their unsystematic natural history. We borrow Lamarck's term but give it a new meaning. For us, zoological phi- losophy is not science but philosophy. More precisely, it is an approach to philosophy that is informed and shaped by the several sciences of animals, namely: evolutionary biology, comparative anatomy, comparative physiol- ogy, comparative psychology, comparative neurobiology, cognitive ethol- ogy, primatology, and so on. In particular, zoological philosophy is neither a subfield within nor a subdiscipline of philosophy. Like analytic philoso- phy or phenomenological philosophy or ordinary-language philosophy, zoo- logical philosophy is both a way of approaching philosophy and a style or method of doing it. v</page><page sequence="2">Zoological philosophy shares with logical empiricism a commitment to take science seriously, but unlike logical positivism it brandishes no ideol- ogy. It is a close relative of what is sometimes called scientific philosophy : a philosophical approach shaped and informed by the sciences. But whereas scientific philosophy has concerned itself almost exclusively with mathe- matics and physics, zoological philosophy draws from and leans most heav- ily upon the biological sciences, especially those that explicitly treat animals. Zoological philosophy, then, corrects a historical imbalance in the way philosophy has been done. From ancient times philosophers have defined man as rational animal but have limited their inquiries almost exclusively to rationality - as if animality could be shunted off to the side and safely neglected. Even today, most philosophers think, talk, and write as if Darwin had never lived and as if humans were more closely related to the disembodied intelligences of the medievais than to bonobos and chim- panzees. This pervasive inattention to and neglect of animality has been per- mitted to distort philosophy, probably because it has served the needs and interests of the great monotheistic religions. And despite the precipitous decline of these religions in recent times, the attitude has persisted virtually unabated, perhaps through simple intellectual inertia. Whereas zoological philosophy is an old term to which we have assigned new meaning, philosophical ethology makes its debut in this vol- ume. By philosophical ethology we mean a philosophical account or treat- ment of animals. Aristotle and Descartes each produced a philosophical ethology, and so have many great thinkers in the Western philosophical tra- dition. (Some of these philosophical explorations have been rooted in sci- entific biology and scientific ethology, others in folk biology and folk ethology.) But we also find it convenient sometimes to use philosophical ethology as a rough synonym for zoological philosophy. Forgoing disam- biguation, we will trade on the ambiguity of the term and let context deter- mine whether philosophical ethology denotes a philosophical account of animals or the zoological approach to philosophy itself or occasionally both. H. ARISTOTLE'S PHILOSOPHICAL ETHOLOGY: LENNOX, CUNNINGHAM, AND DETEL Aristotle was the trailblazer in zoological philosophy. He put non-human animals, women, children, and men on a biological and cognitive contin- uum. His philosophy of mind is grounded in his biology no less than are his ethics and politics. In this volume, James Lennox explores the relationship between Aristotle's biology and psychology. For Aristotle, reason is central to human life and the study of mankind the ultimate focus of zoology. But vi</page><page sequence="3">here a puzzle arises, for Aristotle expressly debars the study of reason from zoology, thus excluding the most characteristic and important human fea- ture. Lennox seeks to discover whether Aristotle manages to comply with his own prescriptions, and if so, how. Aristotle's treatment of vocalization in humans, birds, and other ani- mals carefully avoids any reference to the role of articulate sounds in prac- tical and theoretical reasoning. Similarly, although for Aristotle the human heart is the seat of reason, his discussion of the heart skirts all mention of cognitive functions higher than perception. It might appear, however, that Aristotle violates his own prescription when he advances an explanation for the upright posture of humans and for the structure of the hand, for in both cases "organization for the deployment of reason" is the key to the explana- tion. Lennox nevertheless concludes that Aristotle successfully adheres to his own prescription, for what the prescription excludes is any theoretical treatment of reason in the zoological explanation; mere mention of reason constitutes no violation. The theory of reason calls for methods and means that go beyond zoology. It demands an independent special inquiry, one sup- plied by his de Anima. For Andrew Cunningham such a partitioning of Aristotle's work into distinct fields and methods is highly problematic. In his contribution to this volume, Cunningham finds a deep unity of purpose in Aristotle's philo- sophical ethology, whereas Lennox delineates several quasi-independent lines of inquiry. And also quite unlike Lennox, Cunningham does not see Aristotle as a zoologist or biologist at all. He regards such characterizations of Aristotle's animal books as anachronistic and misleading. To think of Aristotle as a pioneer in the biological sciences, he contends, is to miss his distinctive Plato-inspired philosophical project. Cunningham argues that by focusing on the seemingly "biological" subject matter of Aristotle's animal books and ignoring the non-biological enterprise contained therein, contemporary commentators have produced a distorted portrait of Aristotle. For example, Aristotle does not dissect ani- mals because he is practicing comparative anatomy. Rather, he dissects the body in order to study the soul, the seat of which is the body. In this fashion Aristotle continues Plato's inquiry into the soul, but without repeating Plato's unfortunate mistake of rejecting empirical methods. According to Cunningham, Aristotle investigates animals because they are soul-in-action. In order to understand the nature and attributes of the soul, Aristotle studies anatomy. One cannot appreciate the unity of Aristotle's project, Cunningham claims, without eschewing modern disci- plinary boundaries. Although sensitive to the non-modern character of Aristotle's goals and methods, Wolfgang Detel rejects Cunningham's thesis that Aristotle is "not vii</page><page sequence="4">a biologist." Detel locates Aristotle's non-modernity not in his choice of "field," but in his employment of types of explanations that contemporary scientists would shun. Some explanations characteristic of Aristotelian biol- ogy are functional , in the sense of explaining how the parts of animals oper- ate in the body, but others are teleological without being functional in the foregoing sense, e.g., explanations in terms of goals that the animals them- selves pursue. Still other explanations are intentionalist, for human and non- human animals alike. While non-human animals are cognitively limited to sensation and imagination, humans also possess reason, but non-human ani- mals nonetheless possess full-fledged intentional states and bona fide means-end rationality. Additionally, and perhaps most tellingly, Detel finds that Aristotle qua biologist attributes aims to animals from a broad cosmological perspective. These aims or goals are neither functional nor intentionalist in the senses already mentioned. Rather, non-human animals participate in the eternal and divine just as humans do. Non-human animals are impaired or deficient in only one way - the contents of their intentional states are relatively impov- erished - yet non-human animals participate in the divine no less than humans do. In concluding with a conjecture bound to excite animal-rights pundits, Detel states that this "explanatory parity should have some signifi- cant consequences as to the moral status an Aristotelian biologist should be committed to attribute to animals." m. AQUINAS' S AND DESCARTES'S PHILOSOPHICAL ETHOLOGIES: G. MASSEY AND MASSEY &amp; BOYLE Aristotle may have been the first zoological philosopher, but he was cer- tainly not the last. He was also the first but not the last philosophical ethol- ogist. Many giants of Western philosophy have composed philosophical accounts of animals, occasionally quite comprehensive ones, in the normal course of developing their epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of lan- guage, phüosophy of mind, or ethics. Although the essays in this volume fall squarely within zoological philosophy or philosophical ethology, it is impor- tant to note that many recent discussions of animals by philosophers fall outside these categories. For example, contemporary treatments of animal minds and animal rights are often neither informed nor shaped by zoologi- cal science but rather by armchair zoology, folk science, television nature shows, and casual observation of household pets (in isolation from con- specifics and natural habitats). While such work is not necessarily bad phi- losophy, it is certainly not zoological philosophy as we understand the term. Whether such work might qualify as philosophical ethology depends upon viii</page><page sequence="5">its systematicky and other philosophical features, which in any case would likely be enhanced by sound scientific grounding. Some dramatic examples of philosophical ethology are found in the work of St. Thomas Aquinas. Who could understand Aquinas 's theory of free choice (arbitrium liberum ) without grasping his conception of animal initiative? Or who could understand his theory of natural law without under- standing how and why animal behavior is supposed to provide a moral win- dow onto it? Gerald Massey argues in this volume for the surprising thesis that Aquinas 's theory of natural law rests in significant part on sociobiolog- ical foundations. Massey emphasizes two important points: first, natural law has an empirical foundation in biology, and, second, much of medieval biol- ogy was empirically false. That medieval biology contained many false- hoods should occasion no surprise, and Aquinas can hardly be blamed for the false empirical propositions; that he wove into his arguments. But aware- ness of these numerous false empirical claims and the role they play in his moral reasoning is important if we are to appreciate and evaluate the ethical positions staked out by Aquinas on such important topics as homosexuality, monogamy, and incest. So sociobiology, far from being the recent and sus- pect innovation many now suppose it to be, was already a prominent feature of the thirteenth-century sexual ethics of Thomas Aquinas. Clearly, then, reliance upon a "corrected" sociobiology (based on up-to-date biological and ethological research) would be critically important for anyone who might try to develop a modern version of Thomistic natural-law sexual morality. Failure to take account of the pervasive presence of philosophical ethol- ogy has distorted work in the history of philosophy, sometimes profoundly. Even when an extensive body of work on animals-in-philosophy has been produced (as in the case of Descartes scholarship), the subtlety and com- plexity of the issues often elude the most careful commentators. And schol- ars who propose to provide only historical surveys seem prone to caricature Descartes as the cold-hearted automaton theorist who contrasts unfavorably with Hume and other warm-hearted thinkers who credit animals with both reason and emotions. In this volume, Gerald Massey and Deborah Boyle develop a multi- faceted methodology for doing history of philosophy responsibly. Though the methodology is universally applicable, they illustrate it by applying it to Descartes 's two celebrated tests for animal minds. What emerges from Massey and Boyle's analysis of Descartes 's views on animal mentality is not only an account of Descartes 's philosophical ethology, but also an account of Descartes on mind itself and on the role of mind in the mechan- ical world. In short, analysis of Cartesian texts on animals takes one to the heart of Cartesianism itself, and in a manner otherwise impossible. Further, ix</page><page sequence="6">this examination of Descartes 's thoughts about mind serves more than a his- torical purpose, for it sheds abundant light on the concept of mind itself. Massey and Boyle argue that Descartes set the agenda for all future investigations of animal mind, including contemporary ones. They claim that all these inquiries relate to Descartes 's Language Test, to his Action Test, or to the Argument by Analogy from human minds to animal minds. They also explain why Descartes considered the argument from analogy to be an all-or-nothing matter rather than one of degrees, which is the reason why he rejected it. In an attempt to break out of the Cartesian straightjacket, Massey and Boyle bring their essay to a close by presenting an olfactory test for animal mind, which they claim falls outside the three Cartesian cate- gories just mentioned. IV. NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHICAL ETHOLOGY: B. MASSEY Though the importance of the conceptions of animals by such scientific philosophers as Aristotle, Descartes, and Hume is becoming better known,1 Barbara Massey argues in this volume that even a literary philosopher like Nietzsche cannot be properly understood apart from his biologized - and in Nietzsche's case Darwinianly biologized - view of human nature and the natural world. Massey contends that Nietzsche's conceptions of animals and of humans as animals is foundational for his overall project. In the case of Nietzsche, as with Descartes and Hume, an examination of seemingly "peripheral" texts on animals bears exceptionally rich fruit. Nietzsche identifies animality with brutality; cruelty, mawkish Mitlied, superstition and aggression make up our biological inheritance. So, having accepted the bitter truth of common evolutionary descent but determined to "translate man back again into nature," Nietzsche felt compelled to impro- vise a cultural remedy for human animality. The "birth of man" and the "death of God" are part of the transformation required to construct a worthy human life through culture. For Nietzsche and unlike Darwin, no worthy moral values come with our biological inheritance. Science helps us to become "deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers," but it can provide no morally adequate guide to life nor can it uncover one in our animal nature. The true philosopher must have "two brain ventricles," one for science and one for non-science (aesthetics and culture). They ought to cooperate but never commingle. Compartmentalization is what keeps sci- ence and non-science from relativizing or undercutting each other. Aesthetic standards are indispensable for building the worthy moral life, but they must be compartmentalized. Similarly, science - evolutionary biology in particular X</page><page sequence="7">- is necessary and necessarily compartmentalized; in Nietzsche's words, it is "true, but deadly." V. THEORY OF THEORY OF MIND: POVINELLI AND GIAMBRONE, PROUST Fortunately for our understanding of Hume, his work on animals is fairly well known. Hume's Touchstone dictates that, even to merit consideration, a theoretical account of mind must put human and animal minds on all fours, i.e., it must supply a unified explanation of any mental phenomenon common to humans and animals - unless there is a convincing explanation why the human phenomenon is sui generis. Hume also thinks that the argument from analogy to animal minds similar to our own is irresistibly compelling. In this volume, Daniel Povinelli and Steve Giambrone take up both of Hume's challenges. Marshaling empirical evidence to show that chim- panzees lack second-order intentionality, Povinelli and Giambrone report on a series of ingenious experiments designed and implemented by Povinelli and his colleagues at the New Iberia Research Center. These experiments effectively undermine both the argument from analogy and the argument to the best explanation. They suggest that complex, sophisticated behavioral patterns suggestive of higher mental processes, along with low-level psy- chological mechanisms responsible for them, evolved long before animals developed what ethologists call theory of mind. Humans have retained the aforementioned social behaviors of their primate kin while adding a novel representational mechanism. Povinelli and Giambrone dub this the "reinter- pretation" hypothesis. Theory of mind, it turns out, is not a requirement for complex social behavior. As Povinelli and Giambrone say, "[T]he overt behavioral manifestation of theory of mind may be far more subtle than pre- viously suspected." The big surprise is that on the reinterpretation hypothesis our own social behaviors turn out to be quite different from what we have all along supposed. They may not at all be caused by the inner items posited by folk psychology. Instead, the basic repertoire of our social behaviors may be traced to much more elementary causes, even though the emergence of new representational systems may make possible more organized and effective uses of the old primate action repertoire. Povinelli and Giambrone not only show in a dramatic way why the hallowed argument from analogy is sus- pect, they also explain why folk psychology may be grossly mistaken about how minds basically work. Joëlle Proust examines the philosophical implications of the work of xi</page><page sequence="8">Povinelli and other cognitive ethologists and comparative psychologists. She argues that possession of theory of mind is not an all-or-nothing matter, and so the role of theory of mind must be reassessed. Although their social abilities superficially appear to involve such attributions, non-human pri- mates do not attribute mental representations to other members of their social groups. Instead, these primates recognize emotion in conspecifics and use it to predict behavior. They can thus grasp the goals of others without attributing beliefs about the world to them. Ostensive communication, in particular, has been shown to be independent of any representation of men- tal states in others. Proust argues that theory-of-mind abilities depend on two prior capacities: "exercising simulation, as when one actively disen- gages from the present environment to imagine a counterfactual situation, and exploiting simulation, which implies that an imaginary situation is relo- cated within the real world." Apes seem capable of the former but not the latter. Use of symbols may be important in simulation exploitation. The abil- ity to attribute to others beliefs not shared by the self is the strongest proof of theory of mind. Human children cannot do this until age three-and-a-half, and so far no nonlinguistic animal has ever done it. But there are weaker criteria related to the question of mental-concept use, e.g., the animal's ability to discriminate intentional acts of others from accidental events and to recognize emotions in others and respond appro- priately to them. Although non-human primates cannot read minds, they can do many things that are precursors to or components of mind reading. Proust claims, therefore, that full-fledged mind reading is not necessary for social cognition. VI. COGNITIVE ETHOLOGY: GRIFFIN, DE WAAL, AND BEISECKER Zoological philosophy seeks to be informed by relevant empirical findings, so questions about what current zoological theories claim and what method- ologies lie behind these claims and theories become critical. In other words, the work of biologists and ethologists is absolutely central to the enterprise of philosophical ethology. In this volume Donald Griffin, the cognitive ethologist and biologist who discovered echolocation in bats, carefully reviews recent scientific investigations of animal cognition that bear upon the existence and nature of animal consciousness. Griffin finds substantial evidence supporting the hypothesis of conscious animal mind in a wide variety of species, including birds as well as mammals, but he insists that much work, both methodological and empirical, still needs to be done to settle the matter. xii</page><page sequence="9">Griffin believes that "the scientific understanding of animal mentality may well constitute the crowning chapter of the Darwinian revolution." This scientific understanding, however, has been and will continue to be slow in coming, because strict behaviorist explanations - however improbable their serendipitous details - can always be devised to explain such phenomena as plovers leading intruders away from their young or ravens discovering how to retrieve meat suspended on strings. It is hard to maintain scientific rigor and objectivity when investigating apparent instances of animal thought or consciousness. Additional professional anxieties about anthropomorphism may even nip such studies in the bud. A careful, critical "anthropomor- phism" is both difficult to achieve and to defend in the face of behaviorist criticism and entrenched behaviorist dogma. Further, Griffin argues there is among scientists considerable emotional antipathy to the hypothesis of con- scious animal mind, possibly motivated by convictions of human superior- ity. In the spirit of Hume, Griffin asks only that the evidence for animal mind and for human mind be evaluated against a single, fair standard. Professional fear of anthropomorphism and related methodological issues are the focus of Frans de Waal's contribution to this volume. Like Griffin, de Waal also calls for a critical, heuristic anthropomorphism. Typically, anthropomorphism is judged a serious methodological sin. But de Waal thinks there is a dual methodological mistake: anthropodenial , the a priori rejection of shared characteristics (usually cognitive ones) between humans and other animals. Anthropodenial is practiced routinely, even though it sometimes leads to gross distortion of the observable facts. According to de Waal, anthropocentric anthropomorphism, with its naive attribution of human traits to animals, has precipitated this overreac- tion. In contrast to such naiveté, he advocates a stance he calls animalistic anthropomorphism , where naive projections of human characteristics onto animals is eschewed in favor of understanding animals based on what we know of their Umwelt . In ethological research, de Waal recommends a crit- ical method of heuristic anthropomorphism which strives for this animalis- tic perspective, though it may occasionally and unavoidably become anthropocentric. For example, the concept of reconciliation, though derived from human social interactions, has been used fruitfully to explore animal aggression and conflict resolution and has generated new and testable hypotheses. Some scientists have adopted a Dennett-like anti-realist stance toward such hypotheses, but not de Waal. He appeals to evolutionary link- ages between humans and other primates and to a principle of evolutionary parsimony to justify the cautious, critical attribution of concepts like recon- ciliation to non-human animals. Scientific work should proceed unhampered by uncritical assumptions about human uniqueness. De Waal puts it this way: "the more human-like xiii</page><page sequence="10">we permit animals to become the more animal-like we become in the pro- cess." Like Griffin, de Waal thinks that the debate over anthropomorphism is fueled more by the need or desire to elevate humans above animals than by valid scientific concerns. The centrality of biological and etiological work to zoological philos- ophy may suggest to some that good old-fashioned philosophical analysis is somehow being supplanted or overshadowed by empirical concerns. David Beisecker 's paper on animal intentionality should eradicate this misconcep- tion. Beisecker seeks to distinguish varieties of intentionality by focusing on the normativity of intentional phenomena. Different kinds of intentional capacities correspond to different ways in which subjects are susceptible to mistakes or error. Beisecker tries to characterize a prelinguistic animal intentionality distinct from and a precursor to the higher-grade linguistic intentionality on which philosophers have almost exclusively focused their attention. Absence of language, he maintains, need not imply absence of intentionality. Beisecker points out that biological accounts of intentionality, wherein an animal acts and is assessed with respect to norms framed by natural selection rather than by the individual animal, are inadequate to provide an account of mental capacity. Even bacteria can be characterized this way. One must look for ways in which animals might interact with the environ- ment that could render them susceptible to evaluation that is not closely tied to naturally selected "purposes." Dennett's non-realist approach to attributions of intentionality - his cel- ebrated Intentional Stance - would seem useful for characterizing creatures that appear to go beyond Darwinian pursuits. Dennett, however, regards attributions of so-called original intentionality as futile. Beisecker rejects this view because "something's being the product of selection or design might explain why it has a special sort of accountability, but it doesn't fol- low that this accountability must be biological or artifactual." Beisecker argues that an account of how the flexibility of educable animals gives rise to accountability shows how non-biological intentionality could nonetheless be a product of natural selection. For Beisecker, this would be a type of intentionality independent of language, but rich enough to warrant talk of "mental" capacity. The essays in this special volume of Philosophical Topics form an inte- grated excursion into zoological philosophy and philosophical ethology. We are grateful to the editor-in-chief, Christopher S. Hill, for inviting us to serve as guest editors of this important volume. We are deeply grateful to Chris for his vision and his generosity, but also for his patience over delays occa- sioned by a major illness of one of us. Finally, we wish to thank our fellow xiv</page><page sequence="11">contributors for what we think will soon be regarded as important contribu- tions to a new approach to philosophy and to philosophical ethology proper.
