<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS * AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. II, No. 1: Jan., 1965 Substance, Reality, and Primary Qualities, JONATHAN BENNETT Part I: It is almost universally assumed that Locke's view of "reality" as lying beyond the veil of perception is logically connected with, and per haps even equivalent to, the view which he may have held about the instantiation of properties, namely that they are upheld by a substratum substance. These two theories are totally distinct answers to totally distinct questions. The conflation of them goes with an absurd tendency?en couraged by Locke's use of "idea"?to conflate the properties of things with the sensory states we have when we perceive them. Part II: Locke's theory of primary and secondary qualities is usually taken as relevant to phenomenalism or idealism, i.e. as showing that Locke was a phenomen alist about secondary qualities and a realist about primary qualities. This is wrong too, as can be seen when we see what truth there is in Locke's doctrine about primary and secondary qualities. On Being in the Same Place at the Same Time, PETER CAWS Basic Actions, ARTHUR DANTO Descartes' Validation of Reason, HARRY FRANKFURT Descartes is contending with a scepticism which maintains that reli ance on reason defeats itself by leading to reasons for mistrusting the reliability of reason. In proving the existence of a veracious deity, Descartes' aim is to show that the sceptic's reductio cannot be generated?that reason does not lead to a conclusion, such as that there is a demon, which provides a reason for doubting the reliability of reason. What is essential to his argument is not so much that God exists as that reason leads to the con clusion that He does. His procedure does not suffer from the circularity with which it is often charged. Metaphysical doubt concerning the truth of what is clearly and distinctly perceived is shown to be unreasonable by showing that a certain demonstration (of God's existence) has been ac complished. This does not require the assumption that what is clearly and distinctly perceived is true. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of the Review. We want to thank the editors of the journals represented for their cooperation and the authors of the articles for their willing ness to submit abstracts.</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 601 What We Say, RICHARD G. HENSON The essay is a defense of much of what Stanley Cavell said in "Must We Mean What We Say" (Inquiry I, 1958) against the criticisms of J. A. Fodor and J. J. Katz in "The Availability of What We Say" (Philo sophical Review, 72, 1963); it isolates twelve of their arguments and replies specifically to most of them. Included is a brief discussion of what they call the "natural language fallacy," i.e., the "mistake of inferring 'ought' statements about distinctions from 'is' statements about what speakers say": they seem to mean that it is a mistake to think that the distinctions coded in a given natural language are the ones, and the only ones, which a speaker of the language should notice. No one has contended that distinc tions so coded are the only ones a speaker should notice; but the claim that one need not notice such distinctions is extremely puzzling. The Miraculous, R. F. HOLLAND Although the idea of a violation of natural law is not necessarily in volved in the idea of the miraculous, there is one kind of miracle which seems to involve it. Hume's discussion of the evidence for miracles relates to this kind and is interpretable as an argument against its possibility. Also there is an argument that the expression "violation of natural law" signifies a confusion in which the ideas of natural law and legal law collapse into each other. Neither of these arguments is efficacious. Furthermore, the contention that there can be no such thing as establishing the absence of a natural cause is open to objection. However, to be conceived as a violation of natural law, a miracle must be thought of as an occurrence which is both empirically certain and conceptually impossible?which ought to make the notion ridiculous. And yet it need not. Recent Work in Presocratic Philosophy, G. B. KERFERD A survey of books and articles wherever published dealing with the Presocratics in the period 1953-1962. Discussions of points of detail are excluded, but otherwise the aim is to be comprehensive, and over 150 items are covered. In addition to interpretations of individual thinkers from Tha?es to the Sophists, an attempt is made to discern trends and distinguish major problems. Among these are (1) the use to be made of the evidence of Aristotle and Theophrastus, (2) the importance of mythical and religious ideas as sources and constituents for the thought of the Presocratics, (3) how far their thinking can be characterised as "scientific," and (4) the extent to which any genuinely philosophic themes were consciously discus sed, and the dangers inherent in interpreting the Presocratics in terms of various current philosophical ideas. Presupposition and Entailment, GRAHAM NERLICH P. F. Strawson's theory of presupposition as a distinct logical relation oscillates between two incompatible positions, roughly (1) that reference failure removes the truth value of statements, and (2) that it prevents sentences from issuing in statements at all. It is argued that (1) does not</page><page sequence="3">602 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS provide a basis for distinguishing presupposition from entailment. First, (1) does not require that presupposition be distinguished from entailment and in any case the distinction could be based only on some form or arbi trary legislation for logical terms. Strawson's claim that, given his theory and this legislation, we gain advantages in interpreting the logic of the classical square of opposition is false and his reasons for making the claim are confused. Finally, it is argued that position (2) is false at least for cases central to Strawson's argument. An attempt to modify Russell's dichotomy "true false or meaningless" is defended. The High Road to Pyrrhonism, RICHARD H. POPKIN A survey of sceptical thought in the latter half of the 17th century, and an attempt to characterize its major features. After the appearance of Descartes' philosophy, the sceptical attack was redirected against Carte sianism rather than against Aristotelianism and various Renaissance theories. Gassendi, Sorbiere, Foucher, and Huet used many traditional sceptical arguments about epistemology to bring about the downfall of Cartesianism. Pierre Bay le generalized the sceptical attack to undermine all types of theories in science, theology, metaphysics, etc. The paper at tempts to bring out the unique features of Bayle's critical scepticism and of his fideism, to show how different his attacks and his conclusions were from those of previous sceptics, and to indicate that Hume, alone, of the major Enlightenment figures, seems to have felt the impact of Bayle's total scepticism and of his completely irrational fideism. Without accepting Bayle's appeal to blind faith, Hume tried to find a way of living in a world in which all is in doubt. INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. V, No. 4: Dec. 1964 Some Developments of the Buddhist Approach to Reality, KWANSEI TA MURA The concept of reality is studied throughout the main schools of Buddhism after Buddha himself. In early Buddhism, this phenomenal world is characterized by impermanence (constant flux) and insubstantiality (everything is dependent on something else, relative, not absolute), summed up in the law of Dependent Origination. Authentic reality is what lies "beyond" or "behind" this phenomenal world, understood by negation of the above characteristics. Some later schools moved in the direction of a pluralistic realism, playing down the insubstantiality of all things, especially in the case of the soul, and dividing the world into various combinations of basic elements. A movement to restore the purity of primitive Buddhism with its stress on impermanence and insubstantiality ensued, called in general Mahayana Buddhism. Authentic reality was described in terms of voidness (absence of form, distinction, relation, etc.), which does not of</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 603 course mean total nothingness, though it is indescribable in any conceptual way; spiritual identification with reality in its true state is Nirvana or Buddhahood. Some schools analyze this true reality into various basic, un changing and non-phenomenal elements. Despite their differences, basic to all the schools is some distinction between phenomenal reality as we see it and authentic reality behind the phenomenal veil. The Concept of God in the Bhagavad Gita, PATRICK OLIVELLE The aim is to analyze the conception of God in this Hindu classic in terms of our western categories ordinarily used in discussing the nature of God, in order to see how far it is possible to translate this conception into western terms and understand it, and how much still remains obscure or inconsistent, hence needing further discussion and explanation through dialogue of East and West. The conclusions reached are as follows: God is (1) the supreme and absolutely perfect being; (2) personal, and as such superior to the undifferentiated impersonal Brahma of the Upanishads; (3) immutable and eternal; (4) spiritual; (5) free, though this is not clear with respect to creation; (6) unique in his supreme status, though there is an equally eternal higher and lower nature of God, whose relations to the supreme state of God are obscure; (7) both transcendent and immanent (the latter in a strong sense seeming to verge at times towards pantheism), but with the relations between the two left obscure, principally due to the lack of a doctrine of analogy and real metaphysical participation of creatures in God; (8) Supreme Producer of the world, but not strictly Creator, it seems, since production out of nothing is deemed impossible and hence an eternal material substratum for the universe is required as a subordinate co principle with God for explaining the existing universe. Real and More Real, GEORGE I. MAVRODES Theologians and metaphysicians sometimes say that some things (e.g., God) are more real than others. In the paper I examine the logic of the term "real" to determine whether it allows of a comparative sense, and whether any further elucidation of that sense can be given. I distinguish, and set aside, the sense of "real" in which the real differs from the unreal (imitation, etc.) by virtue of some ordinary property. I then concentrate on that sense in which the real is the existent, and the unreal is the non-existent, fictional, etc. An examination of this sense shows that, in common non-philosophical contexts, "real" is often used in a manner which is logically equivalent to a comparative use. This use depends upon a relation of existential depend ence between the entities involved. Therefore, this comparative use of "real" is both meaningful and appropriate in metaphysical and theological discus sions. Sri Aurobindo's Interpretation of Spiritual Experience: A Critique, ELIOT DEUTSCH Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950), one of the leading philosophers of modern India, has put forward a theory of evolution which, on the basis of an</page><page sequence="5">604 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS interpretation of various kinds of spiritual experience, seeks to show the way to the realization of man in a "life divine." The main lines of his theory are summarized, after which the three most important tenets of his theory are analyzed in terms of their standing as explanatory concepts. Objections are raised to the manner in which some of these principles are employed as causal explanations and suggestions are made as to their actual logical status. The article concludes with a discussion of the requirements that a philosophy of spiritual experience needs to fulfill. The author argues that such a philosophy needs to be taken as a kind of phenomenological art rather than as a science and that it must strive to include its insights within the special disciplines of philosophy by showing what the implications of spiritual experience are for those disciplines. Dracula the Man: An Essay in the Logic of Individuation, JOSEPH MAR GOLIS The application of the concept of "one and the same individual" cannot be determined by purely formal considerations of identity. Numerical iden tity requires a substantive rule about what is to count as an individual. Characteristically, we individuate things by applying the criteria for mem bership in a given species. But individuation does not logically depend on the concept of such membership; on the contrary, membership presupposes a rule of individuation?as anomalies like changing (or appearing to change) species and being in two places at once make clear. The reasons for count ing things as "one and the same" are quite various and may include, for instance, considerations of legal responsibility and the like?that is, reasons not reducible to merely arithmetic or logically formal considerations. Philosophy of Religion and Revelation: Autonomous Reflection vs. Theo phany, LOUIS DUPRE By the notion of intentionality, phenomenology overcomes the subjec tivism inherent to any purely psychological interpretation of the religious phenomenon. It assumes that the religious act cannot be adequately ex plained as a subjective experience. However, its own methodological restric tions limit phenomenology to the sphere of immanent phenomena and thereby exclude it from adequately coping with the transcendent object of the religious act. Faith makes its object immanent only by constituting it as entirely transcendent. The religious experience, therefore, never becomes completely immanent; its immanent being retains an essential incomplete ness which is unique in human experience. A full analysis of the act would require a recurrence to a transphenomenological datum. Philosophy does not have these restrictions and seems, therefore, to be a necessary com plement for a full understanding of the religious experience. Yet, most philosophies of religion are too closed and autonomous to do full justice to the notion of transcendence?they often reduce it to another form of im manence. Philosophy of religion can only be done within the framework of a religious, i.e., an open philosophy.</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 605 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. LXI, No. 19: Oct. 15, 1964 Coherence, Certainty, and Epistemic Priority, RODERICK FIRTH Lewis believed that his own theory of knowledge, in its broad out lines, represents the only alternative to a coherence theory of justification. The issue can be defined by construing the two alternatives as answers to the question: What properties of statements are warrant-increasing properties? According to the coherence theory all such properties are "ultimately in ferential." Lewis's doctrine of certainty can be interpreted in various ways, but in any case he maintains that there is one warrant-increasing property that is not ultimately inferential and thus accepts the "thesis of epistemic priority." He attacks the coherence theory on the ground that it cannot distinguish the actual world from other "possible worlds." This purely logical objection can be met by distinguishing two classes of inferentially warranted statements: a class of "basic" warrant-conferring statements and a class of statements that are "derivatively warranted"; and the issue between Lewis and the coherence theory can only be settled, therefore, by methods that are ultimately empirical. C. I. Lewis's Theory of Value and Ethics, CHARLES A. BAYLIS Lewis holds that "Values ascribable to objects are always extrinsic values; intrinsic value attaching exclusively to realizations of some possible value-quality in experience itself" (AKV, 389). Intrinsic values Lewis designates as "satisfactions" and "dissatisfactions" or "enjoyment" and "suffering." What one ought to do, what it is right to do, is to maximize enjoyment and minimize suffering, taking account of the fact that the intrinsic value of these experiences does not vary with the individual who has them. We need only supplement our knowledge of values by adhering to the principle of prudence: "So act as to maximize your total probable realizations of satisfaction over time" (OSI, 91 footnote), and to the Golden Rule?equi valent to Kant's Categorical Imperative?(Ibid., 92). So to act is to act rationally and justifiably. For it is clear that more intrinsic value is better than less, no matter who experiences it. Lewis is an ethical cognitivist. The Artworld, ARTHUR DANTO Vol. LXI, No. 20: Oct. 20, 1964 Plato's Philosophy of Language, RAPHAEL DEMOS This paper is based on the Cratylus, although there is occasional reference to other dialogues. Language expresses a total interpretation of reality; since ordinary or primitive language expresses an empirical view of things, it is incorrect and must be tested by a direct apprehension of reality.</page><page sequence="7">606 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS Thus, there is an exit from language, and such an exit permits a revision of language. In Plato's contrast between the language of the Gods and the language of mortals, we may discern something like the contrast between ideal and ordinary language. (1) Names. In the Cratylus, Plato denies that there are any proper names, although he seems to admit them in later dialogues. By names he means terms which have both reference and sense necessarily; such terms are also verbs, for verbs are names of actions and actions are realities; for instance, a blow. The criterion for the identity of names (as, for instance, in two different languages) is that they mean the same thing. (2) Statements. Unlike names, statements have meaning with out necessarily having any reference. A word is a name only if what it names exists, whereas a statement may be false. A statement achieves meaning by purely internal criteria as to its composition. (3) The Structure of Statements. A statement is not a list of names; it is a unity and has meaning only in its character as a unity. Ryle's view that the terms in a sentence are not independent constituents and that their meaning is con textual is presented. The author concludes that Plato is undecided on this matter. The Descriptive Element in the Concept of Action, RODERICK M. CHIS HOLM The concept of an act involves a descriptive component in addition to an ascriptive component. It is proposed that the former may be analyzed in terms of a single primitive, expressible as "He brought about p in the endeavor to bring about q." It is argued that this ideological concept cannot be defined in terms of desire and that the concept of desire has no "logical connection" with that of an act. These considerations are then applied to the following topics among others: the sense in which a given act may be said at one time both to be intentional and not to be intentional; the concepts of "inadvertent success" and "happy failure"; the distinction between motive and reason; and the distinction between saying "He has X as a motive (or reason)" and "X is his motive (or reason)." Vol. LXI, No. 21: Nov. 12, 1964 Notes on Intentionality, WILFRED SELLARS Robots: Machines or Artificially Created Life?, HILARY PUTNAM Vol. LXI, No. 22: Nov. 26, 1964 On Connotation and Attribute, RICHARD MARTIN Rescher on Arabic Logic, SEYMOUR FELDMAN This article is a historical-philosophical discussion of two works by N. Rescher on the history of Arabic logic: Studies in Arabic Logic and a translation of Al-FarabVs Short Commentary on Aristotle's Prior Analytics. The most interesting essays in the former work are Al-Farabi's discussions</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 607 of future contingencies and of existence as a predicate, Avicenna's analysis of conditional propositions, and Averroes' extensional analysis of modal propositions. In the first of these essays, Al-Farabi rejects the Stoic inter pretation of Aristotle's De Interpretatione IX, which restricts the Principle of the Excluded Middle; and in the second essay, Al-Farabi tries to harmo nize a number of apparent inconsistencies in Aristotle's logic and meta physics. The essays of Avicenna and Averroes are interesting for their discussion of temporal quantification. The translation of Al-Farabi's com mentary also contains useful historical information. The most interesting part of the commentary is Al-Farabi's treatment of inductive arguments. Rescher's notes are also quite helpful. Vol. LXI, No. 23: Dec. 10, 1964 Semantic Theory and the Meaning of 'Good,' JERROLD J. KATZ This paper concerns itself with formulating the meaning of the English word "good" within the framework of a semantic theory of the sort described in "The Structure of a Semantic Theory" (Language, 39, pp. 170-210). A general introduction to this type of semantic theory is given, and then a dictionary entry for "good" is presented. Once the question of empirical adequacy is settled, I turn to some of the philosophical consequences of accepting this entry for "good." I consider the question of whether some other kinds of semantic theories can handle the facts about the meaning of "good" and argue that they cannot. Thus, evidence is put forth against a number of popular conceptions of the theory of mean ing. I also consider some consequences for Moore's discussion of "good" and for Vendler's recent treatment of Moore's notions. My whole treatment is motivated by the desire to show that the application of theories from lin guistics to philosophical problems can lead to genuine philosophical results. Vol. LXI, No. 24: Dec. 24, 1964 Inscriptions and Indirect Discourse, MARILYN P. FRYE Criterion of Personal Identity, NEWTON GARVER This paper examines an explanation offered by Penelhum: "Memory is a criterion of identity if (a) from the fact that someone remembers some thing it follows deductively that he did or witnessed it; and (b) one can establish that someone remembers an event without first establishing independently that he was (bodily) involved in it." Although this explana tion seems plausible, it proves to be inadequate and incoherent. The phrase "the fact someone remembers" contains a crippling ambiguity about whether bodily identity is presupposed: if not there is no criterion, but if so (a) conflicts with (b). Other difficulties are that criteria do not serve as the basis for deductive inferences, that they need not be "established," and that a criterion of identity considers memory claims collectively rather than distributively. So the concept of a criterion has more subtle complexities than anticipated.</page><page sequence="9">608 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS So, Hume Did Read Berkeley, RICHARD POPKIN A recently discovered letter of David Hume to Michael Ramsay (Aug ust 26-31, 1737), located in the Czart?ryski Museum of Crackow, Poland, seems to settle the question I raised earlier (Journal of Philosophy, 1959) of whether Hume actually did read Berkeley. This letter, written shortly after the completion of the Treatise, mentions Malebranche, Berkeley, Bayle, and Descartes as authors to be read in order to understand "the metaphysical Parts of my Reasoning. " The letter also indicates that the Chevalier Andrew Michael Ramsay played a major role in Hume's intellectual career at the time. This document will be of great significance in evaluating Hume's place in the history of philosophy, in establishing the actual historical con text from which his views arose, and in assessing the extent of Berkeley's influence in this context. JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. II, No. 2: Oct. 1964 The Interpretation of Plato's Parmenides: Zeno's Paradox and the Theory of Forms, R. E. ALLEN In the Parmenides, Socrates offers the Theory of Forms as a solution to a paradox raised by Zeno. If this solution is to be effective, the ultimate assumption of the paradox must be nominalistic, identifying characteristics with things characterized. Socrates distinguishes what Zeno had iden tified, but does so in a way which leads to further difficulty; for he treats characteristics as exemplars which cannot be qualified by their own opposites, and though this is satisfactory for restricted terms such as large ness, beauty, or equality, which Plato had mainly in view in the middle dialogues, it is not satisfactory for unrestricted terms such as likeness or unity, terms prominently in view in the Parmenides. This suggests that Plato in the Parmenides has come to see new dimensions in the metaphysical problems the Theory of Forms had first been offered to solve.

BERGMANN Nietzsche in the Light of his Suppressed Manuscripts, WALTER KAUFMANN How reliable are our printed Nietzsche texts? What are the merits and faults of the older editions of his late works, of Schlechta's edition, and above all of Podach's edition of Nietzsches Werke des Zusammenbruchs (1961)? And what new revelations may be expected from unpublished MSS? This article tries to answer all of these questions. Nietzsche's Anti christ and Ecce Homo are considered at length, Podach's sensational claims are disproved in detail, and his editing is criticized. Ecce Homo was com pleted by Nietzsche and is of first-rate importance for our understanding of him. Nothing has come to light since World War II that requires a revision of the Nietzsche image available then, nor is it likely that continued study of his unpublished MSS will seriously affect our understanding of his philosophy. The article also contains brief comparisons of the editing of Nietzsche with that of Hegel, and of the irrelevance of Nietzsche's mad ness and Van Gogh's. John Dewey: The Chicago Years, GEORGE DYKHUIZEN During the ten years when he was at the University of Chicago, Dewey became recognized as one of America's most outstanding philosophers and as one of the country's most distinguished students of education. Deeply influenced by James's functional psychology and adopting the view of Peirce that thought is to be identified with the doubt-inquiry process, Dewey lays the foundation for this instrumentalist logic in which all the terms and distinctions commonly employed in logical theory are to be interpreted as functions within the doubt-inquiry process. Dewey's efforts in the field of education were devoted to bringing the insights of functional psychology and of his own instrumentalist theory of knowledge to bear on educational thought and practice. To test his theories, Dewey founded a laboratory school in which the curriculum centered about "occupations." This school established Dewey's reputation as a leader in educational reform. MIND Vol. LXXIIII, No. 293: Jan., 1965 Time, Space, and Objects, J. JARVIS THOMSON Isomorphism and Linguistic Waste, S. MORRIS ENGEL While it was the opinion of Wittgenstein that the prejudices which stand in the way of seeing how a word is actually used are not "stupid prejudices" but have the "character of depth" and are symptomatic of "deep disquietudes," the kind of analysis of language which has come out of the linguistic movement, far from tending, as it should if Wittgenstein was right, to confirm this, has rather tended to disconfirm it. What, in fact, is most characteristic of that analysis is its own lack of depth and the</page><page sequence="11">610 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS implication that these are stupid prejudices. These results have very naturally led to the belief that metaphysics is nonsense and with it the rejection of almost the whole history of traditional philosophy or, at best, the attempt to re-write it. Such rewritings, it is shown, not only reveal our ignorance of the nature of a philosophic system but of language itself. The Meaning of "Is going to be," C. HARTSHORNE A defense of the "causal theory of predictive truth." Statements about an event or stretch of time are made, not "in eternity," but at or during a time t. If f, the time of the event referred to, is future to t, the event has definite character only so far as causal conditions at t limit the possibilities for i'. Assuming a measure of indeterminism, empirical descriptions are either of the determinate past, or of determinate or indeterminate aspects of the future. Since indeterminate aspects as such disappear as the future becomes past, there are constant additions to determinate truth about events. The contradictory of "X will occur" (the causal conditions at t require X at t') is the disjunction: "either X will not occur (the conditions exclude X at If) or X may-or-may-not-occur (the conditions neither exclude nor require but merely permit X at t')." Thus will, will not, occur are contraries, not contradictories. Liberty and Equality, A. C. GRAHAM Arguments against coercion or racial and class discrimination do not assume moral premisses denied by authoritarians ("All men have the right to liberty/equality"). They assume rules of moral and prudential reason ing ("Absence of grounds for forbidding/discriminating obliges one to allow/treat equally") putting the burden of proof on the authoritarian, who answers with the grounds for coercion and discrimination. Moral or pru dential reasons for an action are reasons for resisting its prohibition; find ing the case for obedience inadequate, one does not require a further "I have the right to freedom." Reasons for choosing the day for an event or the man for a job may include "Friday is unlucky" or "Negroes are lazy"; but if these are rejected, there is no need to add "All days/men are equal." The classical "natural rights" to liberty and equality are distorted reflections of these logical rules. Reduction to the Fourth Figure, D. D. MERRILL This paper develops criteria which show that the fourth figure is the only all-inclusive figure of the syllogism: i.e., that only in the fourth figure does every syllogism (valid or invalid) have an equivalent form. More precisely, every syllogism can be transformed into a fourth figure syllogism by using just obversion and conversion of the premisses. Yet there are some fourth figure syllogisms which cannot be transformed into any other figure, even when conversion of the conclusion and indirect reduction are used in addition to obversion and conversion of the premisses.</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 611 THE MONIST Vol. 48, No. 4: Oct., 1964 Self-Refutation and Validity, HENRY W. JOHNSTONE, Jr. In Philosophical Reasoning, Passmore attempts to distinguish absolute refutations (e.g., the refutation of "No sentence conveys anything") from pragmatic and ad hominem refutations. He says that an absolute refutation is equivalent to both p and not-p, and that no evasion of it is possible. He also suggests that only absolute refutations are valid. This paper challenges Passmore's distinction on the grounds that (1) absolute refutations cannot be reduced to both p and not-p; or, if they can, so can pragmatic and ad hominem refutations; (2) absolute refutations are not, in fact, immune to evasion; and (3) if certain arguments regarded by Passmore as valid are indeed valid, some non-absolute refutations must also be valid. The paper concludes by characterizing valid philosophical arguments as those that maintain philosophical discussion as a distinctive mode of inquiry, rather than allowing it to collapse into a statuesque confrontation. Basic Assumption and Argument in Philosophy, DUANE H. WHITTIER The basic assumptions underlying a philosophical position must be de fended. But no reasons can be given for a basic assumption that do not them selves already presuppose that very assumption as the ground which establishes their "goodness." Moreover, the presuppositional framework that occasions any given philosophical problem, also prevents any solution of it, as long as that framework is adhered to. These two theses are presented by way of examining five specific philosophical disputes. The author concludes that, when philosophers contend over basic assumptions, this contending involves the creation of new rules-of-meaning, rather than appeal to any established rules-of-meaning. Remarks about Philosophical Refutations, D. C. YALDEN-THOMSON This paper is concerned with certain difficulties which stand in the way of refutation of any philosophical contention. It is argued that the gap between the notations of formal logics and ordinary discourse is a more profound obstacle to the establishing of, for example, contradictions in philosophical writings than is generally acknowledged. The intrinsic dubiety of appeals from verbal facts to non-verbal facts is also noted. The last part of the article is taken up with an examination of the infinite regress as a form of refutation. The conclusion is reached that this type of argument is liable to be less coercive than is commonly sup posed. An Analysis of Philosophical Method, IAN PHILIP McGREAL Philosophy is an ordered activity which begins with a question, turns to an investigation of the uses of the language of the question (pragmatic analysis), and proceeds, if necessary, through the following ordered stages:</page><page sequence="13">612 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS pragmatic construction (decision as to the uses of terms), semantical anal ysis (investigation into the meanings of terms relative to their uses), semantical construction (decision as to the meanings of terms), logical anal ysis (investigation into the structure of claims relative to their meanings), logical construction (decision as to structure), metaphysical analysis (deter mination of logical possibilities concerning humanly unprovable matters), and metaphysical construction (commitment by faith to the truth of a metaphysical proposition). The order within philosophy is necessary because the meaning of a term depends on its use; the structure of a claim depends on its meaning; and the metaphysical status of a claim depends on its representing a logical possibility not humanly provable. Is the Appeal to Ordinary Usage Ever Relevant in Philosophical Argument, SID B. THOMAS, Jr. This article attempts to show that certain appeals to the way terms are used in ordinary discourse, when those appeals occur in the course of a philosophical argument, involve their user in a kind of paradox. This para dox consists in the fact that the appeals themselves involve the use of key terms in a non-ordinary way, and which, if their appeal is justified, is un justified. This point is illustrated by detailed examination of two of Wittgenstein's remarks concerning our knowledge of another's pain, and, Norman Malcolm's discussion of the question, "Can I discover in my self whether I know something or merely believe it?". At the end, an analysis is given of why appeals to ordinary language of the sort discussed cannot escape this paradox and why they therefore must be ineffectual as criticisms of philosophical positions. The Concept of Proof, ARNOLD LEVISON Inference and Philosophic Typologies, WILLIAM SACKSTEDER A schematism of types of philosophy is developed according to their choice of a standard or typical kind of inference. The paper argues that this selection of one kind of transformation as basic determines a "schema" whereby logical operations are correlated with possible sciences and hence with the world as it is known. Thus a given philosophy adopts its characteristic use of controversial terms, and sets itself a task which is misunderstood when other philosophic principles are employed. This exposition illustrates a thesis that the kind of argumentation thus favored is a key to the understanding of different philosophic modes, whereas most dichotomous or triadic characterizations of different philosophies are in vidious and rhetorical.</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 613 THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 15, No. 58: Jan., 1965 Specification and Reference, J. R. CAMERON Replies to "Who?" "Which?" "Where?" and similar questions consist in specifications of entities by means of words. The obvious account of specifications, as elliptical statements, must be rejected; in fact the specify ing use of words is basic and independent of their use within sentences in statement-making. The traditional concept of a "referring expression" contains contradictory elements, in that (a) such an expression is allegedly self-sufficient in meaning, like a label, yet (b) its meaning is merely a component part of the meanings of whole sentences. Many difficulties in philosophy of language stem from this contradiction. Now referring ex pressions are just those that can be used in specifications; in this use these expressions do,enjoy independence of meaning. These facts suggest that the contradiction in question springs from failure to distinguish the specify ing from the referring use of words; they also show how the two uses are interdependent and complementary. Reason and Falsification, FRED I. DRETSKE The falsifiability of a certain class of existential statements is examined, and it is argued that when there are reasons in support of such existentials, these reasons occur within a framework which provides a recipe for the statement's possible falsification. Some statements, considered in isolation from their evidential support, appear unfalsifiable; but the giving of reasons presupposes the truth of certain "relevancy-making generalizations" which, by virtue of their general character, afford a means of testing the existential statement for which reasons are given. The logic of this situation is examined in detail with reference to Wisdom's example of an invisible gardener. It is concluded that Popper's falsifiability criterion for demarcat ing scientific from non-scientific hypotheses must be modified to cover only those statements which there is some reason to think true. The Incorrigibles, W. W. MELLOR An attack on the view that first-person sensation-reports are "factually incorrigible," which argues on general grounds that this requirement could not be satisfied by any empirical statement and tries to show, with reference to Ayer's early discussions, that it is not met even by statements couched in an artificial sense-datum terminology. Criticizes the attempt to render sensation-reports as statements of the form "It now seems to me as if. . . ." On the Structure of Existential Judgments, R. HARR? In trying to decide between realism, conventionalism and reductionist positivism as accounts of the role of hypothetical entities and the meaning of theoretical terms, the contrasting attitudes of these schools to the existence of unobserved things, properties and processes, gives a lead only</page><page sequence="15">614 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS if one is clear as to the meaning and independence of existential judgments. One useful suggestion is to treat such judgments as assertions about member ship of compound classes, the intension of one component being connected with the observational, identificational criteria of the putative entity, the other with the kind of thing, property or process it is supposed to be; and so with the prevailing conceptual scheme. This is shown to have the virtue of bringing to light concealed Newtonian priorities in unanalyzed existential judgments. The Location of Pain, D. M. TAYLOR Saying that a pain has a location x is saying that it is of a kind asso ciated with being caused at a location x or that it is of a kind which the speaker has learned to describe in this way due to such an association. The notion of the relative location of sensations is introduced. "I have a pain in the leg" means "I have a pain such that a pain produced in my leg would feel to be in the same place as the pain I now have and pains produced by action on nearby places would feel to be nearby." Describing two sensations as feeling to be near one another is saying they have the kind of qualitative relationship associated with closeness of causes of sensations. The existence of pain location language implies the existence of systematic relationships of quality among sensations. PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. LXXIII, No. 4: Oct., 1964 Intention and Convention in Speech Acts, P. F. STRAWSON The aim is to elucidate Austin's conception of an "illocutionary act." In the case of some illocutionary acts which are not essentially conventional it is shown that a concept of communication-intention due to H. P. Grice can be used to explain why the illocutionary act has some of the features attributed to it by Austin, in particular that of being "meant to be made explicit" by means of a performative formula. The resulting analysis can not be generalized to cover all cases of illocutionary acts, for it does not fit the essentially conventional illocutionary acts which were Austin's start ing-point. Some common, and some distinguishing, features of these con trasted types of case are set out, and a caution is added against supposing that there are just two clearly exclusive and exhaustive types of case. The Once and Future Sea Fight: Aristotle's Discussion of Future Con tingents in De Interpretation IX, JAAKKO HINTIKKA Aristotle's main problem in De Interpretatione IX is not due to applica tions of tertium non datur to statements about the future but to his tendency to equate omnitemporal truth with necessary truth. A true prediction concerning a temporally specified future event has remained true for an infinity of past time; hence it seems necessarily true (cf. 18b9-15, 19al-6). Aristotle's attempted solution consists in shifting the emphasis from stand</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 615 ing sentences to sentences token-reflexive in that they contain explicitly or implicitly the word "now," which Aristotle habitually thought in terms of anyway. Whatever happens, happens necessarily when it happens in that nothing else could have happened at that moment. There usually is no temporally unqualified necessity, however, for at other times it will be true to say that something else happens instead (cf. 19a23-27). This interpretation is defended by analyzing the structure of Aristotle's argument. Wittgenstein's Picture Theory of Language, DAVID KEYT The proposition "Seattle is west of Spokane" has three parts: two proper names and the predicate "is west of." The fact pictured has two: Seattle and Spokane. But the picture theory holds that there must be a one-to-one correspondence between fact and proposition. How does Witt genstein solve this problem in the Tractatus? On one interpretation the fact contains a third part, a relation, corresponding to the predicate (Evans and Stenius). On another the proposition is transformed by analysis into a two-dimensional diagram, the predicate disappearing in the process (Copi and Anscombe). Both are rejected. Two new suggestions are offered. (1) The number of possible configurations of simple objects is not greater than the number of concatenations of names, so no predicate is needed in elementary propositions. (2) Or the predicate can be taken as the analogue of the direction arrow on a map and not counted as a part of the proposition. How Not to Derive "Ought" from "Is," JAMES AND JUDITH THOMSON Sommers' Reinstatement of Russell's Ontological Program, JOHN 0. NELSON In this discussion-paper I question four theses that I took Sommers to be advancing, among others, in "Types and Ontology" (Philosophical Review, LXXII): (1) that types are indifferent to predicate denial; (2) that a formal method of type discrimination can establish as correct a specific ontology; (3) that subjects of sentences can be located by certain described formal methods; and (4) that there must be one category that includes all others. A Program for Coherence, FRED SOMMERS The following are some points made in reply to criticism of the author's "Types and Ontology" (Philosophical Review, July, 1963): (1) If p is a property, define the category of p (Cp) as the set of individuals that can significantly be said to have p. (2) If any individual belongs both to Cp and Cq, then either Cp includes Cq or Cq includes Cp or Cp = Cg. (3) An ontology is coherent only if it satisfies (2) for all individuals. Sup pose that spirits cannot be characterized as colored or colorless, i.e., they are not in C-colored. Assume also that chairs are not in C-sad. Then neither category includes the other. Yet persons are in both. To avoid incoherence we must deny that persons are individuals. Coherent alter natives to Cartesianism put chairs in C-sad (panpsychism) or spirits in C colored. The thesis supports Russell's general idea than any coherent ontology is formally isomorphic to linguistic type structure.</page><page sequence="17">616 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS On Vendler's Grammar of "Good," THOMAS E. PATTON and PAUL ZIFF PHILOSOPHY Vol. XXXIX, No. 150: Oct., 1964 Problems Arising from Erroneous Moral Judgments, H. J. McCLOSKEY In the first part of the article a number of related normative problems are considered, namely: Does the person who acts in accord with his mis taken beliefs (where the mistakes are non-moral and moral) do what he really ought? Are his actions morally good? Is he morally praiseworthy in so acting? How should praise and blame be allocated? For most cases the answer to the former three questions is "Yes," although different consid erations suggest different answers. Further, different cases, e.g., people such as conscientious Nazis suggest the answer "No." The second part of the article is directed at exploring the meta-ethical problems raised by these problems and by our answers to them, in particular those problems which arise for a moral property theory such as that of W. D. Ross. Definition of a Moral Judgment, TIMOTHY L. S. SPRIGGE Most recent philosophical accounts of moral language apply equally to much non-moral evaluative language. What distinguishes moral judg ment from other sorts of valuation? The answer proposed is that moral judgments alone express attitudes which we would like supported (if necessary) by the pressures of the moral sanction. An attitude is supported by the moral sanction if and only if action in conflict with it brings the threat of ostracism from the community at large, or at least some dis comfort suggestive of this. The Account of the Nature of Moral Evaluation in Hume's Treatise, P?LL S. ?RDAL Hume's concern is moral evaluation, not moral language. His descrip tion of the conditions of moral evaluations has been mistaken for analysis of the meaning of moral language. Hume's language appears to express two incompatible views, that evaluations are (1) emotions (Emotionism) and (2) judgments about the evaluator's emotions (Subjectivism). Reasons for this: (1) Approvals and disapprovals of character are love and hatred arising from an unbiased view. Thus whenever "I feel approval of X" is justified, "X is virtuous" is justified. (2) Ideas and impressions are not different in kind. Hence (a) having an emotion is not different in kind from the (b) thought that you have it. Thomas Reid disregards the difference between (a) and (b) in criticizing Hume. From Hume's sentimentalist analysis of thinking it follows that "evaluations are emotions" does not entail "evaluations are neither true nor false." Hume nowhere adopts the emotive analysis of evaluative language though it would have agreed with his associationism. Pragmatic Justification, NICHOLAS RESCHER</page><page sequence="18">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 617 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. XXV, No. 1: Sept., 1964 The Principle of Sufficient Agreement, BERTRAM MORRIS This essay views ethics as involving two inter-dependent principles of civil life: utility and sociality. The first relates man to nature and depends on knowledge; the second relates man to man and depends on agreement. The stimulus to reach agreements derives from outstanding disagreements. Civil life supposes that there is always a good and sufficient reason why persons should compose their differences as civil beings rather than to magnify them into irreconcilable hostilities, even if the latter are some times unavoidable. One cannot expect to live in the world and fashion it to his dreams; but because the arts can provide in social affairs both utility and beauty, one can expect to live in it and with others with both effect and elegance. Accordingly, progress which is neither elitist totalitarianism nor dreary technocracy, is possible, and can make life freer by rendering prior agreements unnecessary and present ones more enhancing of life. Reflections About Total Views, ARNE NAESS The article attempts to induce the reader to feel that an explicit total view is something paradoxical and unreachable, but that argumentation against the possibility of a total view is not less paradoxical. To take refuge in scepticism is self defeating because efforts to be modest, whether in claims to know or otherwise, tends to pass into wild immodesty if pushed very far. Whereas Spinoza and others may have intended to elabo rate an explicit total view, researchers into their system do well by treating their system as penultimate, one-step-from-total. Believers in total views are perhaps today more often found among social scientists than among philosophers. Karl Mannheim, e.g., is believed to have an allembracing frame of reference such that he can sweepingly locate and describe "the total structure of the mind"?including the philosophies?of any epoch. Epoche and Fable in Descartes, DONALD B. KUSPIT The paper deals with differences between Descartes' discovery of the cogito ego as science's ground of certainty and Husserl's deciphering of the cogito ego as the first intimation of the transcendental ego. Husserl's epoch? is used to explicate Descartes' doubt via a discussion of Descartes' usage of fable. The following general conclusions are made: (1) Descartes could not possibly have conceived of intentional consciousness because he was more interested in ascertaining science?he never leaves the fact-world for consciousness; (2) a distinction is made between internal and external doubt in Descartes, the former extracting the clear and distinct, for sanity's sake, from the confused world, the latter constructing science separate from the world as a realm constituted by the extracted clear and distinct; (3) the cogito ego and science are never more than problematic, for Descartes is less certain about what they are than about the fact of his unclarity and in</page><page sequence="19">618 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS distinctness?he aims more to attain clear and distinct consciousness than a science. Also, discussions are offered of the part/whole, dreaming/wak ing relationships in Descartes, and of Descartes' God, all as test cases for the above generalizations, all clarified through Husserl's world-conception. Transcendental Phenomenology and Existentialism, JAMES M. EDIE The aim of this paper is to attempt to define what is meant by a transcendental structure in terms of the sense it has been given by the developing phenomenological tradition from Husserl to the present time. After distinguishing the phenomenological sense of transcendental from the "objective" transcendentalism of Greek and medieval philosophy and from the "subjective" transcendentalism of Kantianism, it will be possible to give the transcendental an ontological, i.e., "existential," meaning. It is this new definition of the transcendental which is the unifying element in the extremely diversified studies of the phenomenological existentialists and the basis of a new ontology. What Husserl called transcendental analysis, what Heidegger calls existential analytics, what Sartre calls existential psychoanalysis, and what Merleau-Ponty calls radical reflexion all have in common their fundamental phenomenological intention of disclosing and thematizing those foundational noetic-noematic structures which are given in experience as the constitutive conditions of the possibility of experience as such. The Concept of Estrangement in Early and Later Writings of Karl Marx, JOHN O'NEILL Problems and Requirements in Theory Rendering, PAUL WEINGARTNER The article tries to give an answer to the question: "How can we select the important and significant statements of a doctrine or theory?" This is done by two definitions (which are also applied to examples of the history of philosophy) according to which one can distinguish two senses of the expression "important and significant statement of a doctrine of theory": (1) The statement in question has a high logical content (i.e., a large nontautological consequence-class) and therefore a low degree of probability (in the sense of calculus of probability). (2) The statement has a high empirical content ( = a large class of potential falsifiers) and also a low degree of probability; i.e., there is a large class of self-consistent, singular existential statements of the form "there is a so and so in the space-time region k" which are forbidden by the statement in question, i.e., with which it is inconsistent. Ordinary Experience, A. H. JOHNSON Some philosophers cast aspersions on ordinary experience because of its reputed contradictory and superficial characteristics. This paper is a general examination of some phases of ordinary experience (i.e., philoso phical theories and techniques are not dominant or decisive) at its best, namely the experience of enlightened, adult, normal, human beings. "Adult" and "normal" have their obvious meanings. By "experience" is</page><page sequence="20">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 619 meant awareness of an entity (i.e., of anything). "Enlightened" experience is characterized by comprehensiveness and balance, in particular the recog nition of genuine distinctions and the avoidance of artificial and over simplification. In the context of this type of experience, the following topics are briefly discussed: the perception of physical objects, meaning, truth, causation, good, God. It is concluded that some philosophers have inadequately observed and interpreted this type of experience. And Yet: A Kantian Analysis of Aesthetic Interest, SIDNEY AXINN Suppose that, in addition to having contradictory intentions as their essential nature, humans know themselves to have contradictory intentions. The spectacle that such individuals present to themselves is that of an entity that tries to move in opposite directions, and yet has coherence. For Kant, individuals are continually torn between their personal interest in pleasure and their human interest in mankind's rational progress. This is the one-many predicament that art works objectify. The "nature" that art imitates is the psychological nature of the individual. By generalizing on this framework we find a basis for the aesthetic interest of devices such as contrapposto, rhythm, alliteration, a play within a play, etc. The aesthetic moment is assumed to be the moment in which one both wants something to continue because it gives pleasure and yet feels that it must not continue because it is irrational. RATIO Vol. VI, No. 2: Dec., 1964 Examples, WILLIAM SACKSTEDER This paper is an effort to capture the rationale of the constant use of examples in current philosophy. Perhaps the quarry escapes. But in its pursuit, the logics of many different uses of examples are traced through sciences, legal uses, arts, mathematics, personal relations, ordinary discourse, and various philosophies, ancient and modern. Examples are sometimes used to discover or sometimes to prove; to show the one or to show the many; to exposite pre-existing ideas or to destroy them; to find our way among cases or to show the deceptions of the particular. There are also cases in which speaking about exemplification seems invited yet improper, such as the triangle, the work of art, or the beloved. Vagueness and Value, LENNART ?QVIST The article proposes and elaborates a new idea in the theory of value. On the basis of a theory of vagueness due to S. Halld?n (The Logic of Nonsense, Uppsala, 1949), the following claims are made: (1) Propositions asserting a vague property of one of its borderline cases are meaningless in the sense of being neither true nor false. (2) Predicates like "good," "bad," etc., in their normative sense, connote properties that are not only</page><page sequence="21">620 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS vague but totally vague in the sense that every entity is a borderline case for them. Propositions of value are hence taken to be neither true nor false, but for reasons different from those commonly adduced by emotivists. The details of the underlying theory of vagueness are presented and yield, with respect to value-concepts, results that look about as equally plausible, in the author's opinion, as those ensuing from emotivist and non-naturalistic objectivistic theories. A necessary condition for the correctness of the defended view is that ethical naturalism is false. Meaning and Illocutionary Acts, D. HOLDCROFT On the Impossibility of Sense-Data, JOHN 0. NELSON When philosophers debate whether sense-data exist or not they do not refer to sense-data defined as after-images but as appearances or looks of material things. In this sense of the term "sense-data" (hence-forth capitalized) I show that it is impossible for there to exist Sense-data. My argument is a reductio ad absurdum of this sort. It is an absurdity to suppose that appearances might have appearances. But if we suppose the existence of Sense-data we shall have to suppose that appearances have appearances. Hence, we cannot suppose that Sense-data exist. I employ as the basis of my argument Moore's description of how, looking at his hand, he comes, on a little reflection, to doubt that he sees his hand and decides that he sees something else, namely, a Sense-datum. The Privacy of Sensations, JOSEPH MARGOLIS If pains are private objects, then the public language of pains supposes a private rule of the sameness and difference of pains. This is not to say that first person reports of pain are reliable, as such, in the public domain ?only meaningful. It is conceivable that I may be wrong in reporting that a given pain resembles another, but, since I cannot exhibit pains pub licly, there are no independent grounds on which I could be shown to be wrong. And it will not be possible to decide questions regarding private objects by appealing to public criteria: the reason is that, though we learn the use of "pain" and similar terms in the public context of the characteristic circumstances in which we feel pain, pain and behavior are only contingently connected. The oddity about pains is that we learn to name a private object in a public way. Hegel on Empiricism, GYORGY N?D0R As an introduction to his Encyclopedia, Hegel gives a survey of the most important epistemologico-methodological schools of thought. He then examines the empiricist trend. This paper examines which historical form, or forms, of empiricism he has in mind. Hegel actually names Hume and the empiricists. But a more detailed study of the text shows us that Hegel presents not one historical form of empiricism, but its logical principle?the "ideal type" of empiricist philosophy. This "ideal type" is constructed with the aid of a whole series of specific historical forms of empiricism, from the philosophical systems of the Renaissance through Newton, Locke, Hume,</page><page sequence="22">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 621 and the French materialists and natural scientists. The most important features of the "ideal type" are: starting from the concrete analytical meth od; concern with this life; rejection of metaphysics; worldly ethics; stressing the thinking subject. Hegel's criticism of empiricism was inspired by Goethe. Goethe also criticized the onesidedness of analytical thinking, the "Newtonian method" of thinking. Nevertheless, the Hegelian methodo logical position differs in several respects from that of Goethe. When Hegel criticizes empiricism, he makes allusions to the empiricistic features in the "anti-empiricistic" methodology of Goethe. Aristotle's Golden Tautology, ROLAND PUCCETTI The doctrine of the mean is often claimed to be at least a useful guide to moral decisions because it has wide applications. Seeing why this is so may shed light on its logical character. After tracing the development of the doctrine in Aristotle's Ethics, it is found to have a tautologous structure. It would be self-contradictory to agree that a certain action or feeling is "excessive" or "defective" in the circumstances, yet virtuous; or to agree it is neither "excessive" nor "defective," but "intermediate," ant at the same time claim it is vicious. And this holds true whether disputants in a moral issue have different views of the facts or different moral values. It is concluded that the doctrine of the mean, where applicable at all, adds nothing to our moral knowledge. So much as it tells us is deducible from our language. Some Comments on Schlick's Ethical Theory, R. C. PERRY The paper, in the main, is an argument against those positions of Schlick which are central in current positivistic ethical writings. It dis cusses Schlick's "law of the will," his theory of value, and his view in regard to freedom and moral responsibility. It argues that (1) it is to thought rather than to feeling that deliberate action is due; (2) value is to be identified with capacity or disposition, and is accordingly as objective as that whose capacity or disposition it is; (3) the concept of moral freedom is not that of free (determined) willing; and (4) "moral responsibility" cannot be fully defined in terms of causal law. It holds that belief in freedom of the will is native, and advances an argument in support of its trustworthiness. Hume on Pure and Applied Geometry, F. ZABECH Flew, in his book on Hume and also in his review of my book, at tributes a view to Hume which is too good to be true. He claims that Hume in the Enquiry distinguishes pure from applied Geometry. I argue that neither Hume's general thesis: that all ideas in the last analysis are cash able in terms of sense experience, (repeated in the Enquiry) or the two casual remarks cited by Flew ("Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature, the truths demonstrated by Euclid would forever retain their certainty and evidence," and "Geometry assists us in the application of this law.") warrant such an interpretation. Hume, in both Treatise and En quiry does distinguish between necessary and contingent statements without</page><page sequence="23">622 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS violating his principle. Hume's view is not similar to Mill's but is similar to Locke's: mathematical concepts are experiential while mathematical truths are analytic and instructive. AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY * Vol. 1, No. 4: Oct., 1964 Recent Work in Inductive Logic, HENRY E. KYBURG This article attempts to review everything that might be of interest to inductive logicians that has occurred in the fourteen years since the publication of Carnap's Logical Foundations of Probability. The entire article is written from as neutral a point of view as possible, in order to be as helpful as possible to the non-specialist. There is a bibliography of roughly 450 titles. The topics into which the article is divided are the following: 1. The "necessity" of inductive conclusions. 2. Induction based on factual assumptions. 3. Induction and ordinary language. 4. "Plausible implication," "degree of factual support," etc. 5. Is inductive logic self justifying? 6. Pragmatic forms of induction. 7. The new problem of induction: "grue" and "bleen." 8. Simplicity and the acceptance of scientific hypotheses. 9. Inductive logic as a theory of logical probability. 10. The paradoxes of confirmation. 11. Subjectivistic probability. 12. The game-theoretic approach. 13. Some of the more important problems of inductive logic that have come to the fore in recent years. THE MONIST Vol. 48, No. 3: July, 1964 Dewey on Experience and Nature, GARRY M. BRODSKY This paper defends Dewey's theory of experience against charges that it is anthropomorphic and idealistic. I argue that Dewey's claim that predicates such as "confused," and "cheerful," are to be applied primarily to situations and only secondarily to human selves does not amount to the attribution of human properties to nature because a situation, according to Dewey, is a natural complex which contains a human being as one of its components. The thesis that Dewey (like Whitehead) sought to over come the bifurcation of nature and experience by attributing a mental "ground" to nature (e.g., atoms) is shown to be mistaken. Dewey's principle of continuity asserts not ontological idealism but the need to frame ultimate categories so that no rigid oppositions emerge in the first place. Finally, I consider and refute the charge that "experience" is an all-in * The following abstracts were received too late to be published in the December issue of the Review.</page><page sequence="24">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 623 elusive term in Dewey's vocabulary and so, that his claim to have overcome the gulf between experience and nature is trivial. John Dewey on Freedom and Choice, WILLIAM H. HAY The common opinion that Dewey held personality to be determined by environment is attacked. An account is given of how Dewey described the development of novel traits of personality. Through the use of intelligence people may gain more freedom of choice. A person can free himself to a degree from acting on impulse, for impulses can both be checked and transformed. This transformation can be produced by repeated acting on ideas entertained. Ideas can come to be more effective on conduct by ap propriate reflection. An extensive account of features of reflective experience is presented, drawn from several different sources in Dewey's writings. THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 14, No. 57: Oct., 1964 An Ambiguity in Berkeley's Principles, E. J. FURLEN Principle. Section 1: "It is evident to any one who takes a survey of the objects of human knowledge, that they are either ideas ... or else such as are perceiv'd by attending to the passions and operations of the mind, or lastly ideals. ..." What noun should follow the "such"? "Ideas" or "objects." Most scholars have inclined to "objects." Berkeley's philosophy of mind does forbid "ideas." But it has not been noticed that a subsequent phrase ("the aforesaid ways") requires that the noun be "ideas." How can philosophy be reconciled with syntax? Various solutions, including a Rylean, considered. The following tentatively adopted: (a) Berkeley did at one stage hold the Lockean or quasi-Lockean, view that the operations of the mind were ideas. (b) He changed his mind on this point while writing his note-books. (c) He had written a draft with an opening paragraph stating the Lockean view. (d) His manner of revising his drafts shows that he could have reached section 1 in its final form by correcting and re-correcting his Lockean draft. (e) When he corrected his "such ideas" to "such" he was deliberately leaving his statement vague?deliberately, for purposes of exposi tion, not just in order to pacify Lockean readers. (f) The process of correction and re-correction produced an incon gruity between his philosophy and his syntax, an incongruity which he overlooked.</page></plain_text>
