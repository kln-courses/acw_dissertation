<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILFRID SELLARS REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN (Received 29 November, 1971) I Donagan sets the stage for an examination in depth of my views on 'determinism and freedom' by sketching the general philosophy of mind which underlies them, and by contrasting it, in relevant respects, with those of certain other philosophers (e.g. G. E. Moore and John Austin), whose contributions to the topic have become contemporary classics. After correctly describing my views on 'free will' as reconciliationist in the Hume-Mill tradition, he carefully reformulates in more perspicious terms the technical apparatus which I used in an attempt to make more precise the distinctive features of my analysis. There is little if anything in his restatement of my definitions and principles with which I would wish to quarrel. Indeed, I am most grateful for the clarity of his transla- tions. It is, as one might expect, with the philosophical commentary which follows that issues begin to arise. It is to these that I now turn. Donagan claims that my "argument... has combined.., two classical reconciliationist themes. They are that anti-determinists (1) have mis- understood what human freedom of action is, and (2) have confounded causal necessity with some form of compulsion." (p. 66.) He is quite right about (1). I did argue that anti-determinists have offered a mis- taken analysis of ordinary concepts pertaining to freedom of action. He is, however, quite wrong about (2). Indeed, in the second paragraph of my essay I expressed the conviction that although the Hume-Mill charge that libertarianism rests on the confusion between causation and compul- sion contains "something of value" it "simply won't do as it stands." (pp. 141-2.) Nevertheless, I did point out (p. 142) that the theme of compulsion lurks as a frozen metaphor in our ordinary use of 'cause' and implied that this theme has played an important role in tempting both anti-reconciliationistic determinists and anti-determinists alike to Philosophical Studies 27 (1975) 149-184.

Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht-Holland</page><page sequence="2">150 WILFRID SELLARS think that action which admits (in principle) of causal explanation cannot be action 'of the agent's own free will', and is rather action for which the agent has a (metaphysical) excuse, and lacks 'real' or 'ultimate' responsibility. The distinctive feature of my argument began to emerge, when I warned against confusing 'compulsion' with the kind of circum- stance which, rather than compelling one to do, rather than refrain from doing, a certain action, precludes, rather, the possibility of either doing or refraining from doing that action. I pointed out that "to go out the window propelled by a team of professional wrestlers is not to do but to suffer, to be a patient rather than an agent." (p. 166.) Indeed, I not only made, rather clumsily, the point that there is a broad sense in which "even a compelled action must be voluntary,"' (p. 160) I also clearly intended the following principle, which I offered as a conceptual truth (p. 152), to the effect that X did A at t -+ x was able to do something other than A at t, to apply to compelled action. Thus X was compelled to do A at t -+ x was able to do something other than A at t. It is the above example of non-agency which lays the ground work for the formal argument of the paper, according to which the primary confusion involved in the free will controversy is between the concept of a circumstance which precludes the possibility that a person does A which applies, as in the case of the wrestlers, to states of affairs which entail that a person is not, in the relevant sense, an agent at all, and that concept a state of affairs which precludes the possibility that a person does A which, applies, according to deterministic principles, to those relevant antecedent states of affairs which are followed by a person's not doing A. It is the former concept which I generalize into the concept of a preventing circumstance, which is clearly intended to be toto caelo dif-</page><page sequence="3">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 151 ferent from that of a circumstance which compells one to refrain from doing A. Thus the central argument of my paper in no way hinges on accusing the libertarian of a confusion between causation and compulsion. For the confusion on which I centered my attention leads to the conclusion that if an action has (in principle) a causal explanation, then it is not really an action; whereas, by itself, the confusion between causation and compulsion would lead only to the weaker conclusion that an action which has (in principle) a causal explanation is, as compelled, an action for which the agent has an excuse and for which 'something else' is really responsible. It is nevertheless worth noting that if, in addition to this primary confusion, one is not clear about the concept of compulsion, nor, in particular, about the sense in which, by compelling someone to do something, one 'precludes the possibility' that he does otherwise (i.e. insures that he acts as desired), the "confusion between causation and compulsion" which was pitchforked out the door may return by the window. Thus, although, like most contemporary reconciliationists, I concentrate on showing that scientific determinism is compatible with 'could have done otherwise,' I nevertheless do believe that in one way or another much libertarian literature makes a smooth and easy transi- tion from 'Jone's action has (in principle) a causal explanation' to 'Jones was caused to do what he did,' to 'Jones was not responsible for his action.' Only if the libertarian explicitly says (as, of course, the best ones do) that if determinism is true then there are no actions, would 1 absolve him of a direct or indirect running together of causation and compulsion. Donagan is, of course, well aware of the fact that my primary charge against the libertarian is that he is confused about the relationship between the forms x was able to do otherwise at t x was able to will otherwise at t and the thesis of scientific determinism. He also sees that in an effort to make this charge stick, I attempted to analyze these forms and argued that if my analysis is correct, then both x was able to do otherwise at t</page><page sequence="4">152 WILFRID SELLARS and x was able to will otherwise at t are compatible with scientific determinism. He correctly points out that I explicate the concept of being able to do (or will) otherwise in terms of the concept of not being prevented by circumstances from doing (or willing) otherwise. But as I have pointed out he errs in assuming that the latter concept, as I have explicated it, has anything to do with com- pulsion. II It still seems to me that if my analysis of x was able to (will) otherwise, is correct, anyone who thinks that scientific determinism entails that no one was ever able to do (or will) otherwise than he did must be some- how thinking of the antecedent state of the universe as a circumstance in which we act. He must, at some level, be thinking that if determinism is true, then the circumstances at which we act are physically incom- patible with our doing or willing otherwise than we do.2 This confusion (for surely it is a confusion) can, of course, play its role without generating for scrutiny an explicit proposition to the effect that 'antecedent condi- tions are part of the circumstances in which we act, so that if determinism is true, the circumstances in which we act are physically incompatible with, hence prevent, our doing (or willing) otherwise than we do.' This brings me to Donagan's commentary on my claim that the char- acter of 'having been involved in a certain antecedent state S of the universe a short time before t' is a 'pseudo-' rather than a genuine cir- cumstance of action by x at t. Obviously, if I were to grant it to be a genuine circumstance, the fact that if determinism were true, the circum- stances in which x acts would always be physically incompatible with his willing otherwise than he does at t, would entail, given my analysis, that x is always prevented from willing otherwise than he does at t. Donagan notes that I consider the following objection: After all, it might be said, "x's having heard an explosion at t" defines a physically relevant circumstance which obtains with respect to x during a subsequent period of time. There are various things which he may not be capable of doing during the period - e.g. feeling peaceful and unafraid. (p. 174.)</page><page sequence="5">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 153 He finds in this "a very strong counter-example to the thesis that all states of affairs that obtain before the period in which x is able to will A, but does not, are pseudo-circumstances of his not willing A, and hence cannot be circumstances preventing him from willing A." (p. 70.) As he sees it, I "tacitly accept it as decisive," because I proceed to give "an altogether new argument for writing off prior states of the universe as 'pseudo-circumstances'." (p. 70.) Nothing could be further from the truth. What I did do was point out that "the law which relates hearing explosions at t to not being in certain states during a subsequent period is a specific law of nature, an 'historical law', which is paralleled at the physical level by historical laws pertaining, for example, to elastic sub- stances." To which I added that "it is with respect to 'real' circumstances that abilities and hindrances are to be explained." (p. 174.) Donagan neglects the phrase "historical law" and treats the passage as though the phrase "specific law" - I should have written 'specific kind of law' - carried the burden of the argument. He then objects, quite rightly, that if scientific determinism is true, every failure by x to will A is covered by a specific law (better 'complex of laws') relating this failure to ante- cedent conditions, and that if I were to include every such case as one in which the antecedent condition constitutes a 'real' circumstance, then x would always be prevented from willing anything he fails to will. But the operative phrase was "historical law," and the context should have made it clear that what I had in mind was that, whether or not we are in a position to give a theoretical explanation of the fact, it is a matter of inductive fact at the empirical level that hearing an explosion affects the abilities of people to act and will for a certain period of time, and hence 'having heard an explosion at t' satisfies the criteria for being a circumstance of action during the subsequent period. Presumably this fact has a neurophysiological counterpart in the ideal scientific image, just as the fact that elastic substances require a recovery time before they regain their capacity to respond again to tension and release has an explanation at the micro-physical level. But though the empirical law relating the circumstance of hearing an explosion to the absence of certain abilities presumably requires, from the theoretical point of view, that x, who has heard an explosion at t, is, as a result, for a certain time in states which are physically incompatible with willing A, it would be a mistake to assume that every physical state of x which is physically in-</page><page sequence="6">154 WILFRID SELLARS compatible with willing A is a theoretical circumstance of his will which implies the absence of an ability to will A, let alone that it is the result of a circumstance which implies this absence. To make this assumption is to discount the specific meanings of 'circumstance of action' and 'ability to act (will)' which distinguish them from the generic notions of 'state of affairs' and 'physical possibility.' Even at the micro-physical level there is a place for capacity concepts. Thus it makes sense to say of a micro physical system that during a certain period it was able to p and able not to p, and to say that even though the system did not p at t, and even though not-&amp;ing was necessary relative to the state of the system at t - dt, it did not, by virtue of this antecedent state, lose the ability to (p during the period from t- dt to t. It is part of the logical grammar of capacity concepts that systems (macro- or micro-) do not lose at t their ability to 9 simply by virtue of the fact that at t they are not 9ing. An automobile does not lose its capacity to go ten miles per hour when it is going one hundred miles per hour, however necessary the latter speed may be, relative to the antecedent state of the universe. In other words, we distinguish between those happenings by virtue of which a system fails to 9 at t without losing its capacity to 9, and those other happenings by virtue of which it fails to 9p at t by being caused to lose, for a longer or shorter time, its capacity to 9. At the manifest level, hearing an explosion at t is physically incom- patible with the occurrence of certain mental states during the subsequent period by virtue of causing a loss of capacity to be in these states. If the identity theory is correct, the core of the scientific counterpart of a persons having the capacity to will A, B, ... is a neurophysiological sub- system S, which is capable of being in states a, P.... And here also we would wish to distinguish between those antecedent states of the person, scientifically considered, which result in the failure of S to be in state a (the correlate of willing A) without causing S to lose its capacity to be in this state, and those conditions which result in the failure of the sub- system S to be in state a, by causing it to lose, for a time, its capacity to be in that state. Presumably, then, when the hearing of an explosion causes a person to lose the capacity to deliberate, or the seeing of an available batch of heroin causes an addict to be unable to will to refrain from grabbing</page><page sequence="7">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 155 it, the counterpart in the scientific image would involve a process which results in the temporary loss by the neurophysiological sub-system, S, of the capacity to be in those states which correspond to the relevant volitions. However all this might best be spelled out - and the task of explaining the various ways in which capacities can be nested and botanized is not an easy one - it is some such distinctions I had in mind when I char- acterized "the law which relates hearing explosions at t to not being in a certain state during the subsequent period" as "a specific law of nature, an 'historical law' which is paralleled by... historical laws pertaining, for example, to elastic substances." Thus I meant by a real circumstance, which prevents one from willing otherwise, one which is by virtue of specific laws (which need not be historical) physically incompatible with having the ability to will otherwise: whereas the 'pseudo-circumstance' defined by my hypothetical libertarian consists in having participated in a prior state of the universe which is nomologically incompatible with willing otherwise - a definition which tacitly identifies the concept of a state of affairs which is nomologically incompatible with willing other- wise, with that of a state of affairs which is incompatible with having the capacity to will otherwise. Donagan apparently senses that something like the above is hidden in my obscure remarks, for after claiming, not unfairly, that I have "not... succeeded in providing an analysis of ability to will, according to which determinism is compatible with ability to will otherwise than one wills," he admits that it "seems... highly probable that, following his general strategy of analyzing ability to will in terms of the absence of conditions preventing willing, he can provide an analysis of conditions preventing willing that will do what he wants." He puts the point nicely by writing The concept of a condition preventing the willing of A is restricted, I am strongly inclined to think, in a way in which the concept of the condition under which the willing of A is physically impossible is not. And if that is so, then ability to will other- wise than one does (understood is the absence of conditions preventing it) is com- patible with determinism. (p. 71.) III I have argued above that, unlike traditional compatibilists, I do not build my strategy on the charge that libertarians confuse causation with com-</page><page sequence="8">156 WILFRID SELLARS pulsion. Thus I am prepared to grant negative answers to Donagan's rhetorical questions Is it true, as a matter of historical fact, that competent philosophers have, in the last hundred years, confused causation with compulsion?... Did Thomas Reid in the 18th century, or Henry Sidgwick in the 19th century, imagine that if a man's acts of will are causally determined, they must be compelled? Do C. D. Broad, or Richard Taylor, or R. M. Chisholm now imagine it? (p. 72.) This clears the way for a discussion of the considerations which, ac- cording to Donagan, the above listed philosophers offer in support of the claim that determinism is incompatible with the concept of man as, in any meaningful sense, an autonomous and responsible agent. "Con- sider Sidgwick," writes Donagan. An excellent suggestion. Donagan quotes Sidgwick as follows: ... When I have a distinct consciousness of choosing between alternatives of conduct, one of which I conceive as right or reasonable, I find it impossible not to think that I can now choose to do what I so conceive - supposing that there is no obstacle to my doing it other than the condition of my desires and voluntary habits, - however strong may be my inclination to act unreasonably, and however uniformly I may have yielded to such inclinations in the past. (Sidgwick [1], 65.) I reply that there is absolutely nothing in scientific determinism which is incompatible with this datum of consciousness. The 'determinism' against which this passage is a protest is a vulgar determinism formulated in terms of the concepts and categories of common sense psychological explanation. As has often been pointed out, if 'strong' stands for 'felt strength', then there is no empirical law which says that having an inclination of a certain felt strength is incompatible with willing to do what, all things considered, one thinks one ought to do. After all, ones sense of duty is not as neatly associated with a cluster of sensations and feelings, as is, for example, the inclination to eat when hungry.3 It is often the contemplation of the results of frustrating inclination in ac- cordance with reason which generates states of feelings - and these un- pleasant states are part of what one has in mind when one speaks of the felt strength of the inclination. At most vulgar determinism is entitled to the weaker claim that, other things being equal, the greater the felt strength of the inclination, the greater the likelihood that it will find expression in action. But this is because a strongly felt inclination is likely to be strong in the sense dis-</page><page sequence="9">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 157 cussed in the next paragraph. After all, an inclination need not be 'felt' - it is had; nor a strong inclination, 'strongly felt'. But such wishy washy, ceteris paribus likelihoods would scarcely satisfy your true ideological determinist. If, on the other hand, 'strength' is taken to mean 'great likelihood of prevailing over the voice of reason', it follows analytically that strong inclination need not prevail. And if 'great likelihood' is replaced by 'certain to prevail', it would, indeed, follow that it is not possible that one act against strong inclination, but nothing in scientific determinism requires that there are in this sense any strong inclinations. If such there are, it is a matter of empirical fact and is not to be known by armchair reasoning about the freedom of the will. So much for the clause "... however strong may be my inclination to act unreasonably." What about "... and however uniformly I may have yielded to such inclinations in the past.", which is supposed to formulate a (not unrelated) deterministic thesis. It should be clear that once again Sidgwick has as his target - not scientific determinism - but that vulgar determinism which blurs the distinction between habits and causal prop- erties. Doing A in C can become habitual, but no matter how habitual it becomes it remains possible to A in C in a manner which removes it from the category of habitual action (e.g. by deliberating anew about the point of doing A in C), or, even to do B instead. No such distinction holds in the case, for example, of the propensity of hydrochloric acid to dissolve iron filings. Nothing in scientific determinism requires that if a person has acquired the habit of doing A in C by doing it ever so often, he has lost the ability to do B in C instead of A, let alone to do A in C in a non-habitual manner. The vulgar determinist supposes, by a confusion of categories, that if every action admits of a (in principle) causal explanation and is, say, the manifestation of a causal property of the agent as a system of sci- entific objects, then it must be an 'expression of character', thus as- similating predictability in principle to the inductive predictability of habitual action.4 But, of course, scientific determinism by no means implies the absurdity that all action is habitual. Add to this the tendency of vulgar determinism to conflate 'habit' with 'addiction', and no wonder the libertarian is up in arms. On the other hand, it must be granted that people are, to a large extent, 'creatures of habit,' that inductive reasoning</page><page sequence="10">158 WILFRID SELLARS based on what people have done in the past gives us a clue to their habits, and that people are likely to do what they habitually do. These truisms, however, no libertarian will deny, and only if scientific determinism had the above consequences would Sidgwick be entitled to his appeal to the deliverances of consciousness. At this point Donagan muddies the waters by offering the following as a summary of Sidgwick's appeal: In short, he simply found it impossible not to conceive himself as having the power to make choices that were not psychologically predetermined. (p. 72.) The phrase "psychologically predetermined" is not semantically lumi- nous. 'Predetermined', in ordinary language, has a cluster of uses, most if not all of which carry with them (as do 'compelled', and 'unavoidable') an implication of a high degree of excusability or absence of respon- sibility. Thus one might say to a football coach: 'What happened was predetermined. Regardless of what plays you sent in, the team would have lost because of the prior decision of players x, y and z to throw the game.' A vulgar determinist, looking at habitual action, might say that it is 'predetermined', meaning that it is the expression of a habit formed by prior decisions. This seems to be the point of the modifier 'psychologically'. But 'all events, including actions, are predetermined' may also be used as a metaphorical - and hence, for the unwary, dan- gerous - way of saying that every event, including action is, under a certain redescription, in principle predictable, given an ideal determin- istic theory, from antecedent conditions. Thus Donagan's summary of the passage he has just quoted from Sidgwick obscures the fact that in- stead of making a valid point against scientific determinism, Sidgwick's appeal is relevant only as a counter to the confused claims of the vulgar or ideological determinist who is snared in the confusions from which, according to Donagan, the sophisticated libertarian has long been free. Vulgar determinism argues: X's action was the necessary consequence of antecedent condi- tions X's action was (in principle) predictable from antecedent conditions X's action was 'caused' by these conditions X was 'caused' by his circumstances to do the action</page><page sequence="11">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 159 X was unable to do (or will) anything else in the circum- stances... compelled... prevented... predictable... predeter- mined... So, X was not responsible for his action Vulgar libertarianism argues: X was responsible for his action X was not caused by circumstances to do the action X was able to do (will) some other action in the circum- stances... not compelled... not prevented... not predictable... not predetermined... X's action was not caused by antecedent conditions X's action was not (even in principle) predictable from an- tecedent conditions So, X's action was not the necessary consequence of ante- cedent conditions After obscuring the force of his first quotation from Sidgwick, Donagan introduces his second quotation of claiming that Sidgwick "did not begin by expounding a conception of free will, and then, by means of some middle term (e.g. not compelled) try to show that free will, so conceived, excludes determinism; rather it was not until he confronted determinism that he clarified his conception of free will." (p. 72.) The end of this introduction is speculative intellectual biography, and, though not with- out interest, does not, as such, illuminate Sidgwick's argument. How- ever, the opening clause, though it, too, has a biographical ring, makes the negative claim that Sidgwick's argument does not have the form If there is free-will, then p. If p, then not-q (e.g. our actions are not compelled). [If determinism is true, then q.] So, if there is free will, determinism is false. Now, in a sense, Donagan is right, for a careful scrutiny of the passage he proceeds to quote discloses the following argument, which is of quite a different form:</page><page sequence="12">160 WILFRID SELLARS The concept of action implies that if on a certain occasion I act contrary to my rational judgement, then I have free choice with respect to that action, i.e. it is not predetermined that (by being so constituted and in such circumstances) I do that action. Therefore, if determinism is true, and it is predetermined that (by being so constituted and in such circumstances) I 'act' in a way which is contrary to my rational judgement, i.e. do not have free choice, then the concept expressed by 'I act' must be fundamentally different (and incompatible with) that which I find it to express when I speak of myself as an agent performing actions. Notice that I have separated this from the concomitant theme of auto- predictability to which it owes at least part of its appeal. The latter attributes to determinism the thesis that in principle a person could pre- dict that he himself will do that which is contrary to his own rational judgement, an idea which naturally evokes the response that a person who infers with scientifically warranted conviction that, as a result of antecedent conditions, he will 'do A' must be using a concept other than, and incompatible with, the concept ordinarily expressed by 'doing A'. But, of course, it is no part of scientific determinism that such auto- prediction is possible. Thus, to make the argument effective, we must interpret it as appealing not to auto-predictability, but to the 'predict- ability' which is simply a matter of the nomological connection between antecedent and consequent states of affairs in a deterministic system. Not even the most extreme libertarian would deny that much of what we do is predictable. We would all, of course, (rightly) deny that every- thing we do is predictable where the predictability in question rests on knowledge formulated in the categories of ordinary psychological expla- nation - though most of us could readily be lead to admit that more of our actions were predictable than we had previously realized. And who would dispute that if someone else, even someone who knew our weak spots and settled habits, would claim to our face that we will do a certain action in ten minutes, we would not only feel but know that we could refrain from doing it, if we thought it worth our while to do</page><page sequence="13">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 161 so. Only by confusion generated by the careless use of metaphors could one suppose that if scientific determinism were true all our actions would belong in the same bag with the actions of compulsive neurotics and addicts.5 Does this not explain why a philosopher who misconstrues determinism along the above lines might believe that he could not accept determinism "without at the same time conceiving of [his] whole con- cept of what [he now calls 'his'] action fundamentally altered"? If, on the other hand, we leave aside the chimaera of auto-prediction, it is dif- ficult to understand why Sidgwick should have thought that x does A entails x's doing A is not the consequence of his 'constitution' and his 'circumstances'. Above all, why, in the passage quoted, does Sidgwick tacitly equate the idea of free choice with the idea that a person's action is not (pre-) determined by the antecedent state of himself and his environment? Some light is thrown upon this question by the fact that although the primary thrust of the passage we have been examining concerns the connection between 'determinism' and the concept of action and takes the form of the argument presented above, it nevertheless also contains an argument of the very form Donagan denies to be present. Made fully explicit this argument has the following structure: [Freely chosen action= dfaction not pre-determined] [Actions in the strict sense are 'actions' which are not pre- determined] (1) If there is free will, there are freely chosen actions. (2) If there are freely chosen actions, there are actions not predetermined, i.e. there are, in the strict sense, actions. (3) If determinism is true, then all 'actions' are predetermined i.e. not in the strict sense actions. (4) Hence, if there is free will, determinism is false. To find this argument is to appreciate Donagan's point, the consequences of which I shall shortly examine, that "incompatability [with determinism] is built into its [free will's] definition" by the sophisticated libertarian. IV Donagan next turns his attention to C. D. Broad, whose grasp of the</page><page sequence="14">162 WILFRID SELLARS metaphysical issues involved in the free-will problem is an order of magnitude greater than that of Sidgwick - though their philosophical temperaments are remarkably alike. He begins (p. 734) by endorsing Broad's claim that most of "those who profess to believe in Free Will" have a concept of free will according to which "volition satisfies two conditions, a negative and a positive. The negative condition is that it is not causally pre-determined." Before turning to an examination of Donagan's analysis and critique of Broad's well known argument, the crux of which concerns the concept of 'agent causation', I pause to stress the fact that Donagan unhesitatingly identifies the concept which 'most of those who profess to believe in Free Will' have (i.e. which certain philosophers have [W.S.]) with "the common concept of free will." (p. 74.) Donagan thus implies that the ordinary man, when he speaks of doing something of his own free will, is using concepts of causality and explanation which have been freed from their tie to the paradigm of the common sense explanation of behavior, and has thus transcended the domain of the practical concepts of 'circumstance', 'action', 'desire', 'impulse', 'habitual action', 'predetermined', 'caused to do', 'able to do', 'prevented from doing', in terms of which non-philosophers normally assess the responsibility of persons for what they do. Unfortunately, the fact that certain distinguished philosophers have built the falsity of sci- entific determinism into their concept of free will would confirm the idea that this falsity is intrinsic to the plain man's concept of 'action of ones own free will', only if there is reason to think that these philosophers have appreciated the distinction between these different types of explan- atory framework. The concluding portion of Donagan's essay rests on the idea that "the common concept of free will" (i.e. the concept of free will common to libertarian philosophers) is the correct explication of 'the common concept of free will' in the sense of the plain man's concept of 'action of ones own free will'. Donagan praises Broad as unique among determinists for recognizing that sophisticated libertarians reject the idea (advanced, for example, by Clifford) that the negative condition entails that human action involves "something wholly capricious or arbitrary, belonging to the moment only,"6 and for recognizing that these libertarians would defend this rejection by insisting that the idea that volitions are not predetermined does not mean that they have no cause. The causation involved is, how-</page><page sequence="15">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 163 ever, unique, for volitions are caused by the self or agent, considered as a substance or continuant, and not by a total cause which contains as factors events in and dispositions of the agent. 03road [1], 214-215.) Donagan summarizes Broad's account of the positive condition as fol- lows: Acts of volition are events, but their causes are not prior events to which they are related according to laws of nature: they "originate from causal progenitors which are continuants and not events." (Donagan, pp. 74-5; the words in quotes are from Broad [1], 215.) To which he adds It is evident [! ] that an act of volition caused by a continuant which could have caused a contrary act is not pre-determined. Donagan then implies (but surely by oversight) that this astonishing claim is equivalent to the more technical formula: That an agent x caused a certain volition (say, the willing of A) at t, does not imply that there are laws of nature according to which x's willing A at t is deducible from x's existence at t. (p. 74.) Neglecting, for the moment, the obscurity of the notion of a volition being deducible (given certain laws of nature) from "x's existence at t," I note that the formula seems to be weaker than the original in that it is apparently compatible (as the latter is not) with the volition's being predetermined. One might think that the real point of the formula is to remind us that Broad approaches even this new and unique form of causation in terms of entailment. An agent's being the cause of his willing of A at t is to be construed as the entailment of the volition by the agent's "existence at t." But this theme plays no role in Donagan's critique of Broad, and, indeed, it obscures his argument. For if Broad were inter- preting libertarianism as the claim that the cause of an act of free will is the agent's existence at t, it would be absurd for him to charge the libertarian, as he does, in a key passage quoted by Donagan, with con- struing the cause of a volition in such a way that it contains "no factor to which the notion of date has any application."' (Broad [1], 215.) Yet Donagan's formula is not without reason, as emerges from the following considerations. In the course of pointing out (p. 75) that it is absurd to say that "the notion of date" has no application to, for ex-</page><page sequence="16">164 WILFRID SELLARS ample, Julius Caesar, who, the libertarian claims, was the cause of "his volition, at a certain moment t in 49 B.C. to cross the Rubicon," Donagan expostulates "do not his birth and death have well known dates?" But if the sense in which dates apply to Julius Caesar is derivative from the sense in which dates apply to events (his birth, death, etc.) pertaining to Julius Caesar, then one would expect that the sense in which dates apply to Julius Caesar as a cause is derivative from that in which dates apply to events pertaining to Julius Caesar as causes. And, given that the sense in which dates 'apply to' events is to be explicated in terms of dates occurring in event expressions (thus 'Caesar's crossing the Rubicon in 49 B.C.'), we would seem to be led back to the familiar idea that although it is as legitimate to speak of Julius Caesar as the cause of an event (in this case, supposedly, a volition), as it is to speak of a cow as the cause of the Chicago fire, this becomes, when unpacked, the idea that it is some (unspecified) event involving Julius Caesar which is, in a primary sense, the cause of the volition. One possible move, at this stage of the dialectic, is to grant that dates occur in the proper expression of the cause, in a primary sense, of a volition, but insist that the remainder of the expression involves not an ordinary event location (running, jumping, celebration, volition) but rather 'existence,' so that the full expression would have the unusual (but not outlandish) form the existence of x at t. Thus one might claim that it is the existence of Julius Caesar at a certain moment in 49 B.C., rather than any ordinary event involving him at that moment, which cause his volition to cross the Rubicon. And if we think of causation in terms of propositional entailment (however this be con- strued), is not this what the concept of the agent causation of volitions would amount to? Is this, perhaps, what Donagan had in mind? But to make this move is to be at a loss to explain how the mere fact of Caesar's existence at t could, as such, entail (with the assistance of relevant 'laws of nature'), or be an essential factor in that which entails,7 the occurrence of any one volition rather than any other. And this consideration would lead us back to the idea that the cause of a volition must be a more 'determinate event than 'the existence of x at t'. The truth of the matter, surely, is that if there is a legitimate sense in</page><page sequence="17">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 165 which a person (as continuant) is the 'cause' of his volition, it is absurd to construe this 'causation' on the entailment model. An effective reply to Broad must make this explicit. It is for this reason, and not as an exercise in plumbing Donagan's philosophical preconscious, that I have spent so much time on his reference to 'x's existence at t'. But is there 'a unique mode of causation' worthy of the name 'agent causation'? The answer to this question must be given in several stages. There is, in the first place, the truism that the mode of causation expressed by Jones caused the book to burn is 'agential' in that Jones did something (e.g. applied a lighted match to the book), and 'unique' in that the relevant concept of 'action', tied as it is to a cluster of concepts at the heart of which lies that of volition, does not apply, save metaphorically, to non-persons. Donagan, after quoting the epigraph to Chisholm's essay on 'Freedom and Action',8 explicates it by pointing out that ... The ultimate movement in a series of movement is sometimes not the first cause in the series. We do not have: moving stone, caused by moving staff, caused by moving hand - finis; but rather: moving stone, caused by moving staff, caused by moving hand, caused by man. (p. 77). But, why does Donagan feel impelled to write 'caused by man' rather than 'caused by willing man'? Surely when he took up his pen to continue, as he does, by writing, And further reflection on the first cause in this series shows that it involves causation of a different kind from that involved in the earlier stages. (p. 77). it must have occurred to him that the distinctive feature of the "dif- ferent kind of causation" with which the series ends is simply that it involves mental states and propensities which have in common an es- sential relation to the will, that is, as Donagan is prepared to grant, to volition. Aristotle himself, as has often been pointed out, does not offer a well-developed theory of the relation between thought and action, but, without going into exegetical niceties, would it be absurd to suggest that for Aristotle the series moving stone, moving staff, moving hand...</page><page sequence="18">166 WILFRID SELLARS ends with something like desiring man? Surely the role played in Aristotle's metaphysics by the concept of final causation escapes understanding if this move is not appropriate. It is sheer confusion to interpret the passage from Aristotle's Physics as an anticipation of contemporary concepts of non-occurrent causation. Donagan writes, If human agents are non-occurrent causes, then, as Chisholm has said, "We have a prerogative which some would attribute only to God: each of us, when we act, is a prime mover unmoved. In doing what we do, we cause certain events to happen, and nothing - or no one - causes us to cause those events to happen (Chisholm [1], 23)."9.9 But Aristotle's prime movers are not, in the usual sense, agents. They do not engage in actions - though they are, of course, pure act. They are causes by being the objects of love or desire. For Aristotle the series (moving) stone, (moving) staff, (moving) hand ends with man, not because man is the "non-occurrent cause" of the hand's moving, but because the desire which is the occurrent cause of the hand's moving is aroused by 'form'.'0 The latter is, indeed, a 'non- occurrent cause' but not in the sense in which agents as continuants are 'non-occurrent', as contrasted with the events in which they participate, but in the quite different sense in which the 'intentional objects' of desire are 'non-occurrent'. And the latter are causes not as things or persons are causes, but rather in a sense which reminds us that for Aristotle, 'cause' is said in many ways. Would it be wrong to suggest that the thread which ties these many ways together is the theme of explanation? According to Chisholm In doing what we do, we cause certain things to happen, and nothing - or no one - causes us to cause those events to happen (Chisholm [1], 23). But further reflection on Aristotle's treatment of causation should have suggested to Chisholm that the idea that ... no thing or person causes us to cause event E to happen which is only, as we shall see, for the most part true, might be compatible</page><page sequence="19">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 167 with the idea that There is (in principle) a cause - in the sense of a theoretical explanation - for the occurrence of every event (including volitions and actions). v In 'Metaphysics and the Concept of the Person' I argued that to say of a person that he is the cause of a certain action (his A-ing), where the context is the metaphysics of action,11 is to say no more and no less than that the person A'd. I now agree with Donagan that my rhetorical claim that "nobody would think of dancing a waltz as causing a waltz" obscured rather than clarified the issue. It ran together the obvious point that the relation between a dancing and a dance (or a waltz) is not a causal one, with the moot point that the relation between a person and his dancing is not a causal one. It is certainly true that if a causal rela- tion is involved, it is unilluminating to assimilate it to the form X, by Y-ing, caused a certain event E. thus X, by dancing, caused a dance. for, we would surely expostulate, X's dancing doesn't cause, but is the dance. But the issue concerns the appropriateness, not of the above formula, but of S caused his dancing and, since the esse of a dance is someones dancing, it is not unreasonable to say that one causes a dance by causing ones dancing - even though the relation between the dance and the dancing is, so to speak, logical rather than causal. Thus the philosophical point I wanted to make is not that there is no defensible sense in which a dancer can be said to be the cause of the dancing, for there is at least one such, it is rather that all of the interesting senses in which a dancer causes his dancing are, in the last analysis, to be explicated in terms of occurrent causation, and that when the dust has settled it will turn out that 'agent causation' as construed</page><page sequence="20">168 WILFRID SELLARS by libertarians amounts to nothing more than an unilluminating reparsing of the fact that people will and act. I shall begin a fairly long story by noting that since I have defended the view that actions are, or can be, caused by volitions, it might be thought that I would accept as proper the locution X, by willing to raise his arm, caused the raising of his arm'2 The answer, of course, is No. As Donagan clearly sees, volitions, as 1 construe them, though they are mental acts, are not mental actions. And what belongs after 'by' in the above locution is an action expression, as in X, by firing the gun, started the race. On the other hand, the following would be proper X's willing to raise his arm, caused a raising of his arm. I have alreadyl3 called attention to the fact that our ordinary causal talk about inanimate objects is largely built on frozen metaphors in which things are treated as simple-minded persons. Thus, although 'by', in the above contexts, has the root sense of 'by means of,' we are willing, in this metaphorical vein, to say such things as that The staff, by moving, caused the stone to move. The hand, by moving, caused the staff to move. These are equivalent to the non-metaphorical The staff's moving caused the stone to move. The hand's moving caused the staff to move. On the other hand, The staff, by willing, caused itself to move is absurd, not because it is anthropomorphic, but because it is a category mistake, for at the level of non-metaphorical person talk, Jones, by willing to raise his arm, caused the raising of his arm involves the mistake of treating volitions as though they were actions.'4 Thus in this case we are limited to the second alternative, i.e. Jones' willing to raise his arm caused a raising of his arm.</page><page sequence="21">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 169 Now, surely, if it is legitimate to say that The cow caused the Chicago fire because we can say that The cow's kicking the lantern caused the Chicago fire it is not unreasonable to say that Jones caused the raising of his hand on the ground that Jones' willing to raise his hand caused the raising of his hand. In traditional terms, the first pair of statements would concern 'transeunt causation,' the second 'immanent causation'. Well, then, if persons can be construed to be the cause of their actions, are they also cause of their volitions? And, if so, does a person cause his volition to do A in any more interesting sense than that he so wills? The answer depends once again on the extent to which the term 'cause' is freed from the paradigm X, by Y-ing, caused z to W. and its connection with the more generic notion of an explanation of why a certain event took place is stressed. We can, in many cases, explain the occurrence of volitions by referring to such things as desires, delibera- tions, impulses, moral beliefs, etc.'5 On the other hand, the idea that the common sense framework contains the actual conceptual resources16 for a deterministic theory in terms of which the occurrence of any voli- tion could 'in principle' be explained, is a snare and a delusion. As I stressed above, it is vulgar determinism which blends the abstract prag- matic axiom, characteristic of the scientific outlook, that all events can be explained with reference to other events, with the fact that we explain human behavior in terms of such concepts as 'habit', 'desire', 'emotion', 'character', 'choice', etc., to form the bastard notion that, without going beneath the level of these conceptual forms, a complete explanation of what people do could, in principle, be obtained. The cash of determinism, if true, can only be found in the 'Scientific Image of Man-in-the World'. I shall now answer the question: are persons the cause of their voli-</page><page sequence="22">170 WILFRID SELLARS tions? in the affirmative, subject to the following considerations. Roughly, persons are the cause of their volitions in the sense in which any con- tinuant is the cause of those of its states which are not, to any relevant extent, explained by what is going on outside them. I pointed out above that in the case of 'transeunt causation,' where X, by Y-ing caused z to W we can speak not only of x's Y-ing as 'the cause' of z's W-ing, but of x as 'the cause' of z's W-ing. I added that I see no objection to making the same move in the case of 'immanent causation. Given that x's Y-ing at t caused x to Z at t + dt we could say that x is 'the cause' of its own W-ing. But we probably wouldn't, unless we were rebutting the claim that it was the action of something other than x which was, in a relevant sense, the explanation of x's W-ing. Thus I have no a priori objection to speaking of a person as 'the cause' of his volitions, provided that it is recognized that such a concept would be built on that of occurrent causation. The previous paragraph suggests that the point of speaking in this way would lie in its contrast with speaking of something or someone other than Jones as 'the cause' of one of his volitions. I pointed out that in the case of actions, we are quite willing to speak of persons as being caused to act in certain ways. We do so in cases where the relevant explanation of why a certain person did what he did lies in what was done by some other person or, perhaps, by an inanimate object. Would we be willing to say that one person's volition was caused by another person or thing? Not, of course, in so many words, for 'voli- tion' is a technical concept involved in the rational reconstruction of how such varied states as desires, emotions, attitudes, deliberations, impulses, etc., relate to action. On the other hand, we are surely willing to speak of desires, emotions, etc., as externally aroused, and, on occasion, to pick out another person or external object as, in a relevant sense, 'the cause' of the desire or impulse with reference to which a given action is to be explained. Presumably, therefore, one who finds the concept of volition useful would be willing to speak of certain volitions as 'caused from without,' thus granting the contrast which would give point to</page><page sequence="23">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 171 saying, on occasion, that Jones himself was the cause of one of his voli- tions. Once again, however, the claim that on occasion it makes sense to say that someone (or something) other than Jones was the cause of one of his volitions would not be an entering wedge for scientific deter- minism, for the latter is certainly not the thesis that in this sense of 'cause' persons are caused to will whatever they will to do. It might be worth pausing to note that philosophers in the Stoic tradi- tion have often thought of 'inclinations' as caused from without, and are, as such, to be contrasted with the 'inner' motive of reason or the sense of duty. I suspect that many of those who reject scientific deter- minism think of 'inclinations' as propensities to will which are grounded in bodily states (taking into account the effects of prior choices), whereas 'sense of duty' or 'sense of what is reasonable' refers to propensities to will which are not so grounded. From this point of view, to accept the 'identity theory' is to assimilate rational motives to inclinations, actions to passions. But, of course, the identity theory doesn't deny the distinctive character of reasoning and rational motivation, it simply argues with Spinoza that things and processes which can be described in non- intentional terms can perform the functions which are implied by the use of intentional terms. But the topic of what it is to characterize a thing or process in intentional terms is one on which it is impossible to say anything illuminating in a few words, and I shall not attempt to do so now.17 Let me return to Donagan's elaboration of Chisholm's use of Aristo- telian terminology by asking When Jones causes a book to burn is he a 'first cause'? Not necessarily, if this means that in the ordinary sense of the phrase Jones was not caused to do that which caused the book to burn. For he might have been caused to do it by the order and power of the court. That people are in this sense caused on occasion to do what they do is, of course, no entering wedge for scientific determinism. In this sense, agents may or may not be the 'first cause' of what they bring about. The relevant distinctions are context dependent but generally concern the task of assessing responsibility. Scientific determinism, it must be re- membered, does not claim that persons are caused to act (and will) as they do, but only that, in principle, every action, adequately described</page><page sequence="24">172 WILFRID SELLARS in the appropriate theoretical vocabulary, is a state of affairs which is derivable from an antecedent state of affairs given the principles of an ideal (deterministic) theory of what persons ultimately are. But, it will be urged, even if there is a sense in which persons can be caused to do things, Aristotle's pithy remark concerns another sense of cause in which persons are invariably the 'first causes' of actions which can be imputed to them from a metaphysical point of view. To put the question bluntly: Is there a sense in which persons are the 'first causes' of even those actions which they are, in the above sense, caused to do? And is this sense of 'first cause' incompatible with scientific determinism? Now any contemporary peripatetic worth his salt would surely agree that 'cause' like 'being' is said in many ways. Distinguendum est. Might it not be true that a person is, in this sought for sense, the 'cause' (or 'principle') of his actions, even though all his actions are subject to the principle of scientific determinism, and hence in still another (reasonable) sense caused? VI At this point it might pull things together a bit if I return to Donagan's critique of Broad. It will be remembered that he argued, contra Broad, that the 'notion of date' does, indeed, have application to the agent who, according to the libertarian, is the cause of his volition. Unfortunately, as we saw, Donagan's argument would be an ignoratio elenchi unless he can show not only that the 'notion of date' applies to the agent (which Broad can easily grant), but that it applies to the agent as cause. We saw that Donagan seems to be aware of this, and that he apparently seeks to avoid the ignoratio by introducing the 'agent's existence at t' to be the cause. However, we also saw that this idea is no sooner intro- duced, than it is abandoned without trace - though we are left with a sense of puzzlement as to how the agent's mere existence at t can be (though obviously a necessary condition) the essential causal factor in the occurrence of a specific volition at t. And, as we shall see, this puzzle- ment remains after the schema X's existence at t causes volition is replaced by the formula, treated as basic, X at t causes volition.</page><page sequence="25">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 173 It is in terms of the latter that Donagan sums up the positive results of his examination of Broad. He writes I conclude that Broad's analysis enables us to give a clear answer to Moore's question: In what sense do believers in free will assert that a free agent is able to will otherwise than, at a given time, he does will? They assert it in this sense: (i) that willing as he does at the time is not deducible, according to laws of nature, from the state of the universe at an earlier time (Broad's negative condition); and (ii) he himself, as non-occurrent cause, at that time, of a certain volition (Broad's positive condition) could, at that time, have been the non-occurrent cause of some alternative volition. The "could" in (ii) is absolute: That it is not analyzable into "would have, if..." is implied by (i). (p. 75-6.) As for the negative condition, I have already argued that the philosoph- ical libertarian includes it in his definition of 'action of ones own free will' because he mistakenly thinks that scientific determinism is incom- patible with the claim that the agent could have acted (or willed) other- wise. We shall see in a moment that Donagan is prepared to grant that this is a mistake, which implies that he has some other reason for thinking that the negative condition must be included in the definition, if it is to be an analysis and not an arbitrary stipulation. But what of the positive condition? It is illuminating to note that no sooner has Donagan offered this "clear answer to Moore's question," than he turns his atten- tion to the charge that the libertarian gives no more content to X, at t, causes his volition to A than S, at t, wills to A. He argues against this by offering an analogy. Strictly speaking, he de- velops this analogy in connection with the parallel charge concerning 'causing an action' and 'acting,' but he clearly intends it to apply also to the case of volition, and I shall formulate it accordingly. So a male sibling is no more than a brother, but... just as by thinking of brothers as siblings we get clearer about what brothers are, so by thinking of [willing volitions] as causings of a certain kind, we get clearer about what [willing] is. (Adopted from p. 76.) Now in my previous remarks on the issues involved in 'agent causation' I granted that there is a perfectly good sense in which a person is the cause of his volitions. But, although the spirit of my remarks was con-</page><page sequence="26">174 WILFRID SELLARS ciliatory, I insisted that agent causation in this sense is a special case of the 'immanent' counterpart of 'transeunt' continuant causation. Calling attention to the close tie between 'cause' and 'because' or explanation, I argued that the concept of agent causation hinges on the idea that a person's volitions are, on occasion, explainable with reference to ante- cedent mental states of that person, and has its primary application to those cases. I also pointed out that to say that Jones himself was the cause of a certain volition serves the dialectical purpose of rebutting the charge that the best explanation of that volition lies in someone or something other than Jones. By implication, I have left open the possibility that there are volitions, the occurrence of which cannot (even in principle) be explained in terms of our ordinary categories of psychological explanation. Notice, for example, that the term 'impulse' functions as an escape valve. Sometimes it stands for one or other of a familiar kind of short-termed desire - in which case it belongs to the framework of ordinary psychological explanation; but it can also cover cases where ordinary explanation simply fails. The following thought experiment may be helpful. Consider the case of a person whose brain is probed and whose arm goes up - not, how- ever, because the relevant part of the motor center has been touched, but because his conceptual center is led to reverberate with the thought 'Why not raise my arm?' We might call this an 'impulse', and, indeed, unlike the results of stimulating the motor center, it can be resisted in the sense in which 'inclinations' are resisted. But if this practical question was confronted by no alternative, can we not suppose it to develop into the corresponding volition? Would we, perhaps, deny that the 'volition' was a genuine volition? Or would we not, perhaps, grant its volitional status, but deny that the person was its cause? Compare the case in which neural activity, initiated by stomach contractions, stimulates the con- ceptual activity 'Why not eat?' Surely a relevant consideration is that stomachs are parts of persons, but electronic probes are not. However one reacts to this thought experiment, I submit that unless some explanation in terms of antecedent states of the agent is, however indefinitely, presupposed, there is no meaning to the claim that the agent was the cause of his volition, other than that he so willed.'8 In other words, on my account of agent causation it makes sense to say that x's</page><page sequence="27">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 175 willing to A is a kind of causation, as brother is a kind of sibling. I do not see that Donagan is entitled to this analogy. The second point I wish to make about the positive condition in Donagan's definition of free will concerns the fact that it requires not only that the agent be the "non-occurrent cause, at this time, of a certain volition" but also that the agent "could, at that time, have been the non- occurrent cause of some alternative volition," where "the 'could'... is absolute," in other words, "is not analyzable into 'would have, if...'." The point is simply that the idea that the agent could have willed other- wise, where the 'could' does not mean 'would have, if...' is equally central to my reconciliationist position. It is true that in the case of action, I defend that idea that X could have done A' is to be analyzed as X would have done A', if he had so willed and, hence, in terms of the schema could = would have, if... but it is not true that I make a parallel move in the case of volition, nor (I believe) does Donagan think that I do. Thus he clearly sees (p. 67-8) that my account of volition precludes me from construing X would have willed to do A' as X would have willed to do A', if he had willed so to will. And, which is more important, his careful reconstruction of my analysis of Throughout P, x is able to will A does not exhibit it as having the form During P, x would have willed A, if... Thus, I take Donagan to grant that the sense I give to 'could' in 'could have willed otherwise' is 'absolute', in the sense that "it is not analyzable into 'would have, ...'."</page><page sequence="28">176 WILFRID SELLARS One final point about the positive condition. After claiming, not with- out reason, that I have "not... succeeded in providing an analysis of ability to will, according to which determinism is compatible with ability to will otherwise than one wills," Donagan indicates the general lines along which such an account might be given, expresses a "strong inclina- tion" to believe that it would be successful, and, tentatively, concludes that ... ability to will otherwise (understood as the absence of conditions preventing it) is compatible with determinism. (p. 71.) In other words, Donagan admits that a reconciliationist is entitled to an 'absolute' sense of 'could have willed otherwise'. What, then, is the issue? One begins to suspect that when all is said and done, it turns out not to be: Is 'could have done (willed) otherwise' compatible with determinism. Nor even: Are agents the non-occurrent causes of their actions (volitions)? Sometimes the relevant question seems to be: Can agents be, in any genuine sense, the immanent cause of their volitions, if scientific determinism is true? where the operative word is, of course, 'genuine'. No survey of the pro- tean controversy about Freedom of the Will would be complete which failed to take this question into account; and since it does transpose some of the issues I have been discussing into a new key, I shall give it a brief, and somewhat rhetorical, inning. I have argued that agents are non-occurrent causes of their actions (volitions) only where they are the immanent causes of these actions (voli- tions), - where 'immanent causation' is to be understood in terms of explanation in terms of antecedent states of the agent. I have stressed the dialectical theme, according to which one says that Jones himself was the cause of his action (volition) in order to rebutt the claim that the 'best explanation' of the action or volition is to be found in the activity of some person or thing other than the agent. At this point it might be suggested that to say that Jones himself was the cause of his action (volition) is simply to deny that the explanation or cause of his action (volition) is, in this sense, external. This would yield another sense of 'agent causation' in which X caused his action (volition)</page><page sequence="29">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 177 would not simply be another way of parsing X acted (willed) for, even if only negatively, it would contain a reference to causation. Let me call this the purely negative sense of 'agent causation.' Notice that agent causation, in this sense, of an action (volition) would be com- patible with the idea that the action (volition) in question had no explana- tion at all. Why should one think that agent causation in this purely negative sense is a useful concept for the explication of human freedom and dig- nity? After all, is it not enough that there is agent causation in the positive sense? But, it will be said, in those cases in which the best explanation of a person's action (volition) is to be found 'outside' him, he is not a genuinely free and autonomous agent. To this the reply, surely, is that these cases can be summed up under the heading 'actions which we are caused to do', and that the existence of such actions19 would be philo- sophically interesting only if one could show that all our actions (voli- tions) are really caused 'from without'; i.e. that we are always caused to act and will as we do. But, it will be said, this is just what determinism implies. For according to determinism all our actions (volitions) are caused by - explainable (in principle) in terms of - events that happened long before we came into being. And what is more 'outside' us than the distant past? Only if there are actions (volitions) which are not caused, can there be actions (volitions) which we are not caused to do (will). Either determinism is false, and there are volitions which are 'agent caused' in the purely negative sense, or with John Wisdom20 we must courageously face the prospect of having existed from all eternity. One can also see how a similar dialectic might lead to the claim that unless agents are the 'first causes' of their volitions, their volitions are merely 'their' volitions, indeed, merely 'their volitions'. In other words, just as Sidgwick thought that an 'action', the occurrence of which, could, in principle, be validly inferred from antecedent events by the use of an ideally true theory would be only an 'action' so-called, so the libertarian might be tempted to think that an ideally predictable volition would be only a 'volition' so-called. Finally, to match metaphor with metaphor, if the libertarian is tempted to say that if determinism is true, then the remote past requires our</page><page sequence="30">178 WILFRID SELLARS biographies, the determinist is certain to reply that the rest of the history of the world must fit around our lives as we fit into it. In this abstract sense, at least, we are autonomous. Whether we are in any more inter- esting sense autonomous, and to what extent, hinges not on abstract considerations concerning the 'causal principle,' but on the specific causal powers which characterize us as rational beings. I shall return to this final point in a moment, after pausing to remark that my aim in these polemical remarks is to challenge Donagan to say just where in his opinion the issue lies. Sophisticated libertarians can be expected to reject the charge that they are guilty of the above confusions, as they have rejected the charge that they confuse 'causation' with 'compulsion'. But what is the alternative? What is the issue? My deepest conviction, hinted at above, is that what really is at stake is the old issue of reasons and causes. If explanation of action in terms of reasons is a special case of explanation in terms of (occurrent) causes, then the concept of agent causation can be given a positive analysis in terms of immanent causation along the lines I have suggested. If not then 'action having a reason' becomes logically distinct from 'action having a cause', and, if these concepts are taken to be not only distinct, but incompatible, agent causation reduces to what I have called the purely negative sense. Alas! the topic of reasons and causes is long, and the remaining life of this paper short,2' so I move on to my concluding remarks. VII If any one theme has been central to my argument it is that reflection on the ordinary practical concepts in terms of which we assess respons- ibility and justify praise or blame provides no reason for supposing that actions (and volitions) which admit (in principle) of a causal explanation would be merely 'action' (and 'volition') so-called. To suppose that it does, I have argued, rests largely on a confusion of the various ways in which 'cause' is said, and, in particular, on the idea that 'cause' in the sense of scientific explanation is more closely connected than it is with 'cause' in the sense in which, by being 'caused to do something', a person may be less responsible than usual for what he does.22 Review- ing this theme will serve to bring me to the concluding paragraphs of Donagan's essay, in which he explores the relation between my two</page><page sequence="31">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 179 'images' of man and my critique of libertarianism. Donagan begins by noting that although it is clearly possible to give a (stipulative) definition of 'action of ones own free will' according to which this phrase would not apply to actions which admit (in principle) of a scientific explanation, and that although "some distinguished philosophers have believed that we have free will in this sense," It would be of interest to [Sellars] only if free will in that sense were implicit in the "manifest image" of man in the world. (p. 78.) Donagan explains that "a cardinal point in Sellars' distinction between the manifest and the scientific images of man in the world is that the latter alone makes use of scientific techniques of theory construction." Thus he quotes me as saying There is one type of scientific reasoning which [the manifest image], by stipulation, does not include, namely that which involves the postulation of imperceptible entities, and principles pertaining to them, to explain the behavior of perceptible things. (SPR, p. 7.) He then comes to the point by continuing, With good reason, Sellars regards the principle of determinism as a principle per- taining to postulated imperceptible entities: It was in fact introduced in connection with atomism. It follows that free-will, as Sidgwick, Clifford, and Broad understand it, cannot belong to the manifest image because it is defined in terms of the principle of determinism. Unfortunately, while this passage contains truth, it does so in a distorted way, as I shall try to make clear. In the first place it is essential to distinguish between levels of con- ceptual structure. My contrast between the two images was primarily a contrast between two first order pictures of the world. This is not to say that in the essay to which Donagan refers I did not discuss the contrast between two conceptions of scientific method and two paradigms of sci- entific explanation. But my primary concern was the impact of specific postulational theories on our conception of man, and the new sense of urgency these theories have given to the venerable clash between realist and instrumentalist interpretations of science. The distinction between conceptual levels I have in mind can be illustrated by the fact that a thinker of philosophical bent might live in the 'manifest image,' as I define it, and yet be either</page><page sequence="32">180 WILFRID SELLARS (a) One who takes as his paradigm of scientific method, in- ductive generalization and deductive systematization; and who, when he turns to human behavior limits himself to the familiar praxiological categories in terms of which we explain why people did what they did and assess their responsibility. (b) One who takes as his paradigm of scientific method atomic theories which (in principle) "save the appearances" by show- ing why perceptible thing obey, to the extent that they do, and within the limits of experimental error, established in- ductive generalizations; and who, when he turns to human behavior, contrasts explanation in terms of familiar praxio- logical categories with an ideal explanation, which he glimpses through a glass darkly, and which would conform to his paradigm. (c) One who takes as his paradigm of disciplined understanding, explanation in terms of final causes, and who postulates not only Cartesian human minds but an additional realm of super-wise, super-good and super-powerful beings (in 'an- alogical' senses of these adjectives, which have (perhaps in- scrutable) super-purposes, by reference to which he makes sense of 'the way things are'. Donagan correctly points out that my 'scientific image' is an ideal image in the sense that it would exist in concreto only "when all the facts are in." (p. 78.) He also recognizes that the 'manifest image' is, in another sense 'ideal', an 'ideal type' as Max Weber uses the term, and that the distinction between the images is a "theoretical one, in terms of which the nature of certain philosophical issues can be explained." (p. 79.) Un- fortunately after these insightful remarks, he proceeds to muddy the waters by describing the manifest image as "the image of man implicit in the thinking in accordance with which he conducts his life in the world - personal, social, political," and used this description to argue that ... it would be wrong to follow Sellars in describing this image as corresponding to the world as we know it to be in ordinary experience, supplemented by certain in- ductive procedures, as though ordinary experience were its source. On the contrary, what a man's ordinary experience is depends in some measure on what manifest image underlies his thinking. (p. 79.) Now I certainly did not intend to identify my 'ideal type' with the "image</page><page sequence="33">REPLY TO ALAN DONAGAN 181 of man implicit in his thinking according to which he conducts his life in the world - perceptual, social and political," for the 'ideal-ness' of my image consists not in its implicitness but - though it is implicit - in the restrictions I place upon it. I quite agree that interestingly different conceptual structures can be "implicit" in the thinking in terms of which different peoples and peoples in different cultures conduct their lives. My manifest image is, however, designed to be an ideal type common core shared by all these ways of thinking. It is, frankly, a version of the familiar notion of a 'groundfloor observation language' which, however, has been extended to include the fundamental categories of intentionality and - if you please - agent causation. As such it is a version of a highly con- troversial notion, and its use is to be justified23 by the light it throws on basic philosophical controversies. But my aim in this section is not to defend the use I have made of these two images, but to correct misunderstanding. For it is the mis- understanding to which I have just called attention which underlies Donagan's culminating argument. He begins by writing, ... a mans religion if he has one, is part of the manifest image in terms in which he thinks about himself and other men. No religion is arrived at by simple observation and induction: many religions, in fact, postulate imperceptible entities, e.g. immaterial gods, immaterial souls. It follows that there may be many manifest images of man, although different manifest images may have much in common. He illustrates his point by an appeal to the difference between the thinking of a cultivated Hindu, that of cultivated Christian or Jew, and finally, that of an (uncultivated) Dayak headhunter, and brings his argument to a head by pointing out that ... in his ordinary life in the world, as well as in his scientific thinking, man postulates the existence of entities he does not see or touch, and for which he has no direct inductive evidence. Thus Donagan seems to think that because such entities are not posited by scientific thinking, they must belong in the manifest image of the person who postulates them. To which the obvious reply is that given the point of my distinction, they belong in neither.24 Donagan compounds confusion by asking: Why, if 'a man's manifest image' can include re- ligious entities, can't it include scientifically postulated entities? But once we appreciate the point he is trying to make, we see that all this iconoclasm has been a detour. It is contained in the following question and answer,</page><page sequence="34">182 WILFRID SELLARS What could be more natural than that a man whose image of himself is orthodox Christian - an immaterial soul informing a living body - should examine the implica- tions of that image with respect to a deterministic conception of the physical world? Sidgwick, whose image of man was Christian, although not his theology, was doing that when he inquired whether, in deliberately choosing between an unattractive ra- tional action and an attractive irrational one, he could conceive his choice as causally determined. (p. 79-80.) The key to this passage is Donagan's earlier claim that according to my analysis, ... free-will, as Sidgwick, Clifford and Broad understand it, cannot belong to the manifest image, because it [free-will] is defined in terms of the principle of determinism. (p. 78.) The truth of the matter is that 'free-will', thus defined, belongs neither to the manifest image nor to the scientific image, for it is a higher order principle concerning the limits of the derivability of events from prior events. If there is a connection of free-will, thus defined, with the sci- entific image, it lies in the fact that only the confusions of the vulgar determinist could lend plausibility to the idea that the conceptual re- sources of the (first level) manifest image are rich enough to generate (even in principle) a universal derivability of events, including human actions, from antecedent events. Thus, instead of demanding that libertarians show that free will, as they define it, is part of the manifest image, and making the issue turn on the relative merits of the manifest and (a supposedly deterministic) scientific image, I simply require the libertarian to show, using any con- ceptual resources he requires, that it is part and parcel of what we ordinarily mean by 'free and responsible action' that it is uncaused in a sense of occurrent causation which, though it belongs to the family of causation concepts, the elder generation of which includes those in terms of which a person is absolved from responsibility for an action or excused for doing what he did, is that junior member of the family which has grown up with modern theoretical explanation. This I submit he has failed to do.

But it would be a serious mistake to suppose that when we do our duty, it is because such feelings occurred. 4 See my 'Fatalism and Determinism', in Keith Lehrer (ed.), Freedom and Determinism, Random House, New York, 1966, p. 146, hereinafter referred to as FD. s It is worth noting that on reflection we tend to become uneasy about saying that the 'actions' of compulsive neurotics and addicts are actions in the full blooded sense - which does not mean that we are tempted to think of them as 'mere bodily motions'. For a discussion of this and related points see FD, pp. 160-1, and below p. 132. 6 Clifford as quoted by Donagan (from Moore), p. 73. 7 Other than in the trivial sense that things which don't exist can't be causes. 8 "... a staff moves a stone and is moved by a hand, which is moved by a man." Aristotle, Physics, III, 256a. 9 Donagan, page 78. The Chisholm quotation is from FD. 'Freedom and Action', p. 23. 10 An elaboration of this point would require an account of those strands of Aristotle's philosophy of mind which developed into the scholastic theory of mental acts, a theory which, in one form or another, has been with us ever since, particularly in the work of Brentano and his successors. 11 The Logical Way of Doing Things (ed. by Karel Lambert) New Haven, 1969. I.e. the attempt to explicate the very concept of an action - as contrasted with the praxiol- ogy of blame, excuses and punishment. 12 An adequate theory of action must obviously explore the relation of 'a raising of his arm' to 'a rising of his arm'. 13 Page 108 above. See also Science, Perception and Reality (London, 1963), Chapter I, pp. 10ff., hereinafter referred to as SPR. 14 This is disguised, in some formulations, by using the term 'undertakes' as a primitive in action theory, for in one of its senses an 'undertaking' is an action - indeed an illo- cutionary performance. 1 5 The structure of such explanation is an intricate topic which must be left to another occasion, along with the question as to the sense in which this explanation is 'causal'. I have discussed this topic in 'Actions and Events', Nous 7 (1973) pp. 179-202, herein- after referred to as AE. 16 The sense in which it can contain these resources in the form of promissory notes will be explored below. 17 For my own views on this topic the reader should consult Science and Metaphysics. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1967, Ch. 3, hereinafter referred to as SM. Earlier formulations can be found in 'Notes on Intentionality', The Journal of Philosophy 61 (1964), 655-65; and 'A Semantical Solution to the Mind-Body Problem', Methodos 5 (1953), 45-82. 18 I shall qualify this shortly, but in a way which leaves it essentially unchanged. 19 Notice that I deliberately avoid highlighting the special case of compulsion. 20 Problems of Mind and Matter, Cambridge, 1934, Chapter 8. 21 I have discussed this topic in AE. 22 Much freer from confusion are such theological issues as whether God (or, perhaps, Nature) so controls the strength of our desires (and other motives) that He (or She) is the true cause of everything we do. (Compare my remarks on John Wisdom's well-</page><page sequence="36">184 WILFRID SELLARS known student opinion poll, FD, p. 161.) It should not be forgotten that until the birth of modem science the problem of free will was largely - though not exclusively - a topic for theologians and theologically oriented philosophers; a stablemate of the problem of evil. Perhaps the best way to clear ones head about free will is to read Pascal's Lettres Proven_ales (?) and then plunge into the clear cold waters of Plantinga's philosophical theology. 23 As is the use of a distinction between its 'Rylean' and 'post-Rylean' phase. For this use of Ryle as a means of clarifying issues in the philosophy of mind, see SPR, chapter 5, 'Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind', also SM, Chapters 3 and 6. 24 One might be tempted to say that the postulation of religious entities (gods, daimons, etc.), like the postulation of departed spirits is 'scientific' by virtue of being a, perhaps systematic, attempt to explain phenomena, and hence can belong to "a person's" scientific image. But my scientific image is, of course, a normative notion, that of the truth which is the formal, final and efficient cause of the scientific enterprise. And the problems I use it to explore arise because some philosophers seem to believe that the general outline of the truth (stimulations of C-fibers!) is before our eyes. For a more sober assessment of how close we are to the scientific image, see my 'Science, Sense Impressions and Sensa, A Reply to Cornman', Review of Metaphysics 24 (1971).</page></plain_text>
