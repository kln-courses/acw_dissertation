<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction The number and quality of field projects focusing on the prehistory of NW Argentina have steadily increased in recent years. 1 At the same time, synthetic studies of such topics as settlement patterns and local or regional cultural development of sedentary village societies have been limited, largely because of a lag in the pursuit and dissemination of detailed data about archaeological se- quences upon which such studies could be firmly based.2 As such data are produced the archaeological wealth of NW Argentina becomes increasingly valuable, applicable to understanding the form, variety, and developmental trajectory of less complex Andean societies, their rela- tions to each other, and their relations to the more com- plex polities of the central Andes in late pre-Hispanic times. As part of a long-range investigation of such topics related to the southern Andes, the author carried out several field studies in the Calchaqui Valley of Salta 1. E.g., G.

Initially focusing on clarifying and defining the ceramic content and associ- ations of village settlements of the Late Penod (ca. 1000- 1550 A.C.) in the middle and upper portions of the valley, fieldwork involved survey, surface collection, and lim- ited test excavation at a large number of sites previously recorded as dating to the Late Period.3 With the assist- ance of Pio Pablo Diaz, Director of the Museo Arqueo- logico de Cachi, a total of 44 sites were surveyed, and surface collections from 24 sites, plus excavated material from one of the sites, were allowed temporary export for detailed analysis. The present report summarizes some of the major findings of the 24-site study.4 The results include new insights into the ceramic sequence of the area, and provide a basis for beginning to outline several characteristics of village society in the region. Context and Sites The Calchaqui Valley is perhaps best known as a semi- arid locality typical of the desiccated eastern portions of the Andes (FIG. 1), where numerous small populations of sedentary farmers and herders established villages adja- cent to artificially irrigable lands along the Calchaqui 3.

The Prehistory of NW Argentina: the Calchaqui Valley Project, 1977 198 1 Gordon C. Pollard State University of New York Plattsburgh, New York The late pre-Hispanic populations of the Calchaquf Valley of NW Argentina may be seen as typical of the native culture of the south Andes. The develop- mental sequence for these sedentary village societies, however, has only re- cently begun to be detailed. Field and lab results pertaining to a survey of 24 sites are summarized, including one of the first ceramic seriations to in- clude the full range of pottery types; ceramic wares and their significance are also identified. Findings further include the first recognition of what are believed to be Middle Period sites for the valley, thus filling an important gap in our understanding of the region's prehistory.</page><page sequence="2">12 ThePrehistoryofNWArgentina:theCalchaqufEalleyProject,1977-19811Pollard Valley, very few had received systematic study, and no detailed ceramic sequence had been established.8 Gen- eral periodization schemes lumped the Calchaqui and Santa Maria Valleys into a common Santa Maria ceramic complex for the Late Period, primarily on the basis of similarly decorated burial urns, while earlier periods re- mained vaguely defined or simply unspecified.9 Corre- spsondences between the two valleys would of course be significant in determining the geographic extent of the local cultures and their patterns of development. A complete description of Santa Maria ceramics as represented by surface sherds at Late Period sites in the Calchaqui Valley offered a logical and efficient initial study to allow more precise inter-site and inter-valley comparisons. Such a study would not only provide de- scription of the most common artifactual form at Late Period sites (sherds), but also a check on the content uniformity of sites that had been previously assigned Late Period chronological positions. Coupled with strati- graphic and radiocarbon-dated material from a refuse mound from one of the sites, the sequence could be further refined. The 24 sites whose surface collections were analyzed are listed in Table 1; sites are located in Figure 2. The vast majority were identified as village sites,l° but the sample included two cemeteries, one small vigilance site, and one Inca site of possible administrative func- tion. Although all sites were relatively small and had previously been assigned association with the Late Pe- riod, the villages showed considerable variation in size and construction. Two villages were comprised almost del lnstituto de Antropologfa (Tucuman 1955-57) 27-59; Gonzales, op. cit. (in note 2) 448.

River and its minor tributaries.5 Seemingly tied to the Santa Maria Valley to the south, on the basis of ceramic comparisons, the zone has yielded no evidence of direct influence from the complex highland Bolivian culture of Tiwanaku6 (ca. 400-1200 A.C.), but Inca domination of the area, beginning in the 1470s, has long been recog- nized. Several authorities also hold that it was the Cal- chaqui Valley which was followed in the first significant incursions of the Spanish into NW Argentina as they moved souffiward from highland Bolivia during ffie 1530s and 1540s,7 presumably following pre-established Inca routes.

The Calchaquf Valley sites studied. Ceramic Collections Artifacts on the surface of each site were collected by a minimum of three persons. Given the small size of most sites and the field objectives, we decided to spread the collectors across each site, and the entire area of each site was traversed. Collectors were instructed to retrieve the full, perceived range of ceramic sherds in terms of decorated and non-decorated rims, bodies, handles, and bases, along with any other small artifacts. Collection was discriminatory to the extent of excluding eroded and very small sherds of minimal "diagnostic" value, min- imizing redundancy by not over-collecting plain or combed utility jar sherds (the most common sherd types at habitation sites), and consciously searching for as wide a range of ceramic classes as could be perceived through a walk-over procedure. Ceramic wares, especially as characterized by types of non-plastic inclusions, were not part of this conscious selection process, and their representation in the collections may therefore approxi- mate a "random" sampling. Collection time varied from exclusively of habitation and refuse mounds, while the others had varying combinations of single- and double- wall stone constructions for room and patio; surface re- mains were poorly preserved and graves were scattered over the sites. Detailed investigations of architectural and village layouts were deferred for later study; primary attention was given to ceramic materials.</page><page sequence="4"> 14 The Prehistory of NW' Argentina: the Calchaquf Valley Project, 1977-1981/Pollard 30 minutes to one hour, depending on site size, and until the project director felt confident that the sample taken was indicative of surface material. More intensive col- lection was done at the larger Borgatta and Valdez sites, with those sites being given multiple subdivisions for separate collection. In addition, a small test pit was ex- cavated into a large refuse mound on the Borgatta site. Excavated by 10 cm. horizontal levels, the pit extended down through 1.6 m. of cultural refuse, terminating in sterile gravels. The resultant collections comprised a total of 6,473 sherds for the 24 sites, 2,142 of which derived from the Borgatta test pit. For the non-intensively collected sites, sherd collections ranged from 23 to 143 pieces, the smallest samples coming from the looted cemetery sites. The project staff collected 1,549 sherds from the various surface sectors of the Borgatta site, and 1,160 sherds from the Valdez site. In total, these comprised a work- able sample that could be studied in detail given export and shipping limitations.ll Beyond descriptive analysis, the collections are clearly appropriate only for presence-absence comparisons among sites. The relatively large surface collections from the Borgatta and Valdez sites, however, plus the excavated materials, are seen as appropriate control samples against which the smaller collections from the other sites can be assessed. As presented by the seriation given below, the surface collection procedures and the resultant collec- tions of 100 sherds or less per site for most sites seem adequate to bring out significant temporal variation among the sites. This undoubtedly relates as well to the distinc- tive features of the ceramics themselves, which include a wide range of forms and decorations. The findings summarized here will be refined as further field work proceeds, and as comparisons are made with larger col- lections in Argentina. Ceramics: Stylistic Analysis, Seriation, and Dating The samples are judged to have provided a sufficient basis for defining basic vessel forms, decorative classes, decorative motifs, and ceramic wares (a combination of the attributes of surface finish, paste, and firing). Petro- graphic microscopy of thin sections of sherds (see ap- pendix) resulted in the identification of a total of 14 wares of local manufacture, and three additional wares associated only with (non-local?) Inca vessels. For vessel shapes of local manufacture, 11 jar forms and 16 bowl forms were distinguished, while only one urn group was recognized on the basis of rim sherds. The major recon- 1 1 .

Variation of urn shape is extremely difficult to de- termine from most sherds, despite the known variation in this form as evidenced by whole vessels from the Santa Maria and Calchaqui Valleys. Figure 6 illustrates many of these variations. 12 General decorative classes included tricolor (black and red on cream), black-on-red, and black-on-cream cate- gories. In turn, these were broken down in terms of specific decorative motifs, which were assigned identi- fying numbers for tabulation purposes, with variations of a given motif being assigned an additional lower case letter. Specific motifs were isolable for four bowl forms, one jar forrn, and urns. These are illustrated in Figures 12. In fig. 6, a-e are from various Santa Maria Valley sites: see Weber, 1978 op. cit.

Broken down by vessel categories, there were 67 variations of 37 basic motifs for bowls, 18 variations of 16 motifs for jars, 63 variations of 33 motifs on urn rims (exterior), and 98 variations of 40 motifs on urn bodies. For each major decorative class, there were 75 variations of 31 tricolor motifs, 129 variations of 62 black-on-cream or natural motifs, and 41 variations of 32 black-on-red motifs, without considering motif duplication on differ- ent vessel forms. Associations of specific vessel forms with a particular surface finish, decorative class, and decorative motif were employed to seriate the 24 sites. Eighty-four such ce- ramic mode associations were manually manipulated against their presence and absence in each of the sites in an attempt to chart, and thus visually represent, the clus- tering of sites with commonly shared combinations of ceramic modes. For decorative classes where there were two or more variations of a basic decorative motif, the variations were lumped as one mode (e.g., tricolor motif for urn body, la-lg). This lumping more readily makes apparent the similarity of sites for a given combination of modes, with, we hope, minimal loss of the possible temporal significance of specific varieties of motifs. To be certain of vessel form and decorative associations, only rim sherds were used in the seriations for bowls and jars unless a particular decorative motif on a non- rim sherd had unequivocal association with a specific vessel form, such as with the tricolor "bell bowl". Sherds from bodies and rims of urns were separated in listing their association with specific decorative motifs. Clearly, only those mode combinations which are evidenced at two or more sites are significant for such a seriation. There were 92 additional combinations of modes which were found only at one or another site. Wares, especially as characterized by their non-plastic inclusions, were not included in the seriation, and were assessed separately. As noted in the appendix to this report, specific wares have both temporal and spatial significance, and provide important indicators of localized production of ceramics and changing preferences in pottery manufacturing. The seriation, one of the first for NW Argentina to utilize the full range of ceramic forms, demonstrated two distinct groupings of sites, with a ceramic progression</page><page sequence="6">oo d j 5 t d X &lt; | i t tS d ' &lt; X &lt; &lt; i N i | t e Everted rim jar, polished red-on-orange x x  16 The Prehistory of NW Argentina: the Calchaquf Valley Project, 1977-19811Pollard Table 2.

Given the continuity and progression, coupled with ra- diocarbon dates from the test excavation and relative cross-dating with known early and late ceramic styles, the two clusters are interpreted as having chronological significance. The result is the grouping of 18 sites in an early group, two sites that have both early and late com- ponents, and 12 sites that form a late group (TABLE 3). The cemetery sites, Cacalar 1 and Rodeo Colorado, are omitted from Table 3; both may represent mixed time periods, although they appear to be predominantly early. While the site clusters are identified on the basis of combinations of ceramic modes or attributes, the se- quence for specific vessel forms or decorative classes can also be assessed from the seriation. Thus, four vessel forms are seen as early (everted rim jars; straight neck, 13. Ceramic modes indicated for a site by an "X'' in parentheses in Table 2 were not present in the collections, but are known to have occurred at the site on the basis of other studies. Also, the cemetery sites of Cacalar 1 and Rodeo Colorado were placed to one side of the chart so that they might more easily be compared to the other sites, which were habitation/villages. everted rim jars; flat base bowls; and everted rim bowls), four forms are both early and late (flared rim jars, bowl form 1, shallow bowls, and urns), and five forms are late (narrow neck jars, deep bowls, libation bowls, bell bowls, and bowl form 2). For general categories of dec- oration and surface finish, we find the early sites to ex- hibit a variety of polished categories, including red-on- orange, black-on-red, plain, and red slipped. Late sites are otherwise not distinguished from early sites, since both clusters exhibit categories of decoration and finish that include gray and black polished vessels, combed plain and bicolor vessels, and smoothed tricolor, black- on-red, and black-on-cream vessels. At the same time, polished Inca vessels are found only with the late site cluster. Specific decorative motifs also have early vs. late associations, and examples for urns are included in Table 4. A "transitional'' column has been added to Table 4 for those motifs that occur on-ly at sites that span the early and late clusters. It is of note that while tricolor urns occur in both early and late site clusters, sites are generally distinguished by specific decorative motifs.

Black-on-red urns seem to be only "transitional" and later, initially involving only simple line motifs becoming elaborated with squared scroll and chevron design elements. Black-on-cream urns are present but rare in the earlier site cluster. Their elab- oration seems initially to parallel that of black-on-red urn sherds, progressing from simple parallel lines with or without dots, becoming increasingly varied and numer- ous through the later sites to include squared and circular scrolls, wavy lines, cross-hatching, checkerboard, ser- pent, bird, and lizard forms, and faces with small cir- cular eyes and rectangular mouths showing upper and lower teeth. Dating for part of the ceramic sequence was provided by five radiocarbon dates from the refuse mound exca- vation at one of the largest village sites, that of Borgatta (SSalCac 16) near the town of Cachi, one of the two sites whose surface ceramics spanned both the early and late clusters of the seriation. The 2,000 sherds of the refuse mound test pit clearly pertained to the late portion of the site's occupation, according to the overall seria- tion, but seemingly prior to Inca presence at the site. The corrected dates, derived from charcoal samples, form a consistent series ranging from roughly 1000 to 1300 A.C. within the standard deviations, and span virtually the entire time range of the deposits (TABLE 5). The prob- able beginning date for the accumulation of the deposits is thus close to or at the traditionally estimated com- x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x</page><page sequence="10">IIGIJ B M1Sr@s 2c 3 4 5 6 w W 1 10 cm 7 8c 8b 9 10  1 2 3c 3b = @ G¢!7 w 4 Sc Sb 5c Sd W WW X W W w s . . 4c 4b S 6 10 cm  8a 8b 8c 9 10 20 The Prehistory of NW Argentina: the Calchaquf Valley Project, 1977-19811Pollard 3 4o 4b £3 10 cm b la 7 lb 3a A,ssr, 7 16  Figure 8.

A sixth date for the Borgatta site was obtained by a C-14 measurement on algarrobo seeds found within a black-on-cream urn, used for the burial of a child, from another sector of the site: 660 + 80 B.P. = 1291 + 85 A.C. corrected14 (sample number I-1 1 ,292). Twenty combinations of ceramic modes found among the sherds of the test pit are ones that were also utilized in the overall ceramic seriation because of their presence at two or more sites. From these it appears that the refuse mound into which the test pit was dug is overwhelmingly associated with the late site cluster. One of the mode combinations is "early" (plain everted rim jar), one is early and ''transitional" (black polished bowl form 1), two are found only at ''transitional" sites (red flared rim jar and the black-on-red small everted rim jar), one is 14.

Notably, with the exception of the small everted rim jar, the "early" and ''transitional" mode combinations come only from the lower half of the test pit. When compared to the ceramic seriation of all 24 sites, the surface collections from the Borgatta site demon- strate that the site's occupation extended both earlier and later than the period represented by the excavated refuse mound. The burial urn from which the C-14 date was obtained is one item of evidence as is the presence on the surface of Inca sherds that date to post-1470 A.C. Earlier occupation is evidenced by at least 22 other com- binations of ceramic modes found on the site's surface and that are in association with the early site group of the seriation. 1 2 t7 i7 7 v F1wi7 8 9 10 11 12 13a 13b 14 15 4 3b 3c 5 6 7</page><page sequence="11"> la lb lc 2a 2b 2c 2d 1 , s 2e 3 10 cm 4 5a 5b 5c a b 7a 7b 8a 8b 8c 9  Journal of Field ArchaeologylVol . 10, 1983 21 Figure 10. Urn rim exterior decorative motifs, tricolor. Signifilcance for Regional Culture Chronology With the seriation and dating, one can now address the question of the relationship of the early and late site clusters to previously documented periods in the prehis- tory of NW Argentina. As already stated, the dates for the Borgatta test pit approximate the beginning of the Santa Maria ceramic tradition as previously defined for this region, as well as the beginning of the Late Period in general at ca. 1000 A.C. There are thus 14 sites among the 24 studied that belong to the Late Period. Of these, Borgatta, Choque, and perhaps La Paya (on the basis of the ceramics described by Ambrosettil5) had their origins in earlier times. Along with the site of Valdez, these sites demonstrate the transition and continuity from an earlier group of at least nine settlements whose ceramics provided the foundations of the Santa Maria tradition in the Calchaqui Valley. Most importantly, the analyses thus reveal a set of sites (the earlier cluster of the seriation) that undoubtedly belong to the Middle Period of the region's prehistory, normally dated 600-1000 A.C. Given the high degree of continuity of ceramics between these sites and those of the Late Period, and especially the fact that large sites Figure 11. Urn body decorative motifs, tricolor. like Borgatta span the two time periods, it is little wonder that Middle Period sites have previously gone unrecog- nized in the Calchaqui Valley. Indeed, all of the sites whose ceramics were analyzed had been previously re- corded, and virtually all of them had been classified as Late Period sites of the Santa Maria tradition. This gap in our knowledge was pointed out by Nunez when he was unable to list any ceramic tradition for the Calchaqui Valley Middle Period in his regional chronology chart. 16 Even though there are still no dates for any of the sites now believed to belong to the Middle Period, one can begin to assess the nature of the Santa Maria ceramic tradition for the Calchaqui Valley, and its relations to the same tradition in the Santa Maria Valley to the south. Two major seriations of Santa Maria ceramics are found in the studies of Weber, and Perrotta and Podesta. 17 Both of these are seriations of urns only, although Perrotta 16. Nunez, op. cit.

Both of these studies were based almost exclusively on whole vessels from the Santa Maria Valley. While emphasizing differ- ences in body shape, Weber included consideration of a wide range of decorative elements, and produced a five- phase seriation (I-V, earliest to latest). The approach of Perrotta and Podesta closely followed that of Weber, and they offer a six-phase urn seriation, adding an initial "O" phase beyond those of Weber. The seriations are purely stylistic, yet the phases are presumed to represent a chronological sequence. Perrotta and Podesta do, how- ever, have some contextual evidence that helps to place relatively some of their phases. It is important to note that neither Weber nor Perrotta and Podesta were able to control for possible spatial variability in the features of the urns they analyzed. The urn clusters they isolated (their phases) are assumed to be a chronological se- quence for the entire Santa Maria Valley. Even though there is additional evidence to indicate phases O-I and V as being early and late, respectively, the possibility cannot be discounted that many of the features in phases II-IV are simply variations that derive from the tradi- tional shape and design preferences of certain settlements or potters. Thus spatial variation could well cross-cut temporal variation, a fact that would be obscured by the stylistic ordering of a random collection of minimally provenienced vessels. Concerning decorative class, both Weber and Perrotta/ Podesta suggest a sequence beginning exclusively with tricolor urns, followed by at least one phase of both tricolor and bicolor (black-on-cream) urns, followed in turn by two phases of exclusively bicolor vessels. This follows a general progression proposed earlier by Mar- quez Miranda and Cigliano. 18 For the sites studied here, such a clear-cut progression cannot be recognized. The latest sites of the Calchaqui Valley seriation do have predominantly black-on-cream urn sherds (e.g., Buena Vista and Potrero de Payogasta), but bicolor urn sherds are found at the vast majority of sites, including those that define the earliest (Middle Period) part of the ce- ramic sequence. Perhaps more importantly, however, the present ser- iation does support the findings of Perrotta and Podesta that the earliest phase in the Santa Maria sequence is one 18. F. Marquez Miranda and E.

For the Calchaqui Valley, though, the earliest phase(s) include both black-on-cream, and black-on-red urns in addition to tricolor forms. This pattern also seems to be emerging, in part, for the Santa Maria Valley, where Perrotta and Podesta have recognized additional ceramic groups dating near the beginning of the Santa Maria sequence including Loma Rica black-on-red bowls in association with San Jose tricolor urns, and Shiquimil geometric urns of both black-on-red and tricolor decoration. Urn decorative motif combinations in the two valleys are difficult to compare, since the sherds of the collec- tions studied here portray very little of an overall vessel design configuration. One feature that can be compared, however, is the mouth, eye, and "tear" representations. The Santa Maria Valley urns demonstrate a much wider range of variation for these elements than the collections from the 24 Calchaqui Valley sites. Except for a narrow mouth with a single row of bared teeth associated with some Middle Period sites (with no counterpart in the Santa Maria Valley), all of the mouth representations in the Calchaqui material are of the rectangular form with upper and lower teeth depicted. This mouth form was common in the Santa Maria Valley only for phases I- III. The curved and triangular mouths of phases IV and V are not evidenced in the Calchaqui collections. Most of the eye varieties from the Santa Maria urns are also not evidenced for the Calchaqui, where circular eyes with either short straight "tears" or long, multiple, wavy line tears are most common. In turn, these varieties are not common in the Santa Maria Valley. Thus, while there are several general and specific cor- respondences between the urns of the Santa Maria and Calchaqui Valleys, there is by no means absolute con- gruence. Both valleys do appear to belong to a common ceramic tradition, but until a wider range of vessel forms from the Santa Maria Valley is described, the degree of cultural similarity and interaction cannot be fully deter- mined. The urn evidence alone, however, does suggest considerable local autonomy in the development and use of specific motifs and vessel forms within a broader com- mon network of beliefs and symbolism. Weber and Perrotta/Podesta differ in their estimates of the beginning date for their seriational sequences.

Maria ceramics in that same valley, ranging from 650 to 1340 A.C.l9 The 650 A.C. date has been generally dis- counted by most researchers as erroneous or equivocal. Accordingly, Perrotta and Podesta suggest their phase "0" began around 1000 A.C. or slightly earlier,20 and emphasize that the ceramic changes within their six urn phases were a gradual transition. Weber, on the other hand, seems to accept the 650 A.C. date at face value, and allows ca. 200 years for each of his five phases.2l The radiocarbon dates for the Borgatta site in the Cal- chaqui Valley do not greatly assist in resolving this issue. Both tricolor and bicolor urn sherds were found in vir- tually every layer of the Borgatta refuse mound exca- vation, with its C-14 dates ranging from roughly 1000 to 1300 A.C. This fact suggests that tricolor urns contin- ued longer in the Calchaqui Valley than in the Santa 19. E.

What can be con- cluded on the basis of the present findings is that the Santa Maria tradition, in the Calchaqui Valley at least, began much earlier than 1000 A.C. If the seriations of Weber and Perrotta/Podesta have any validity, then the ceramics from the Borgatta refuse mound would seem to be closest to their phase III so that much of their sequence would date well into the previous Middle Pe- riod (600-1000 A.C.), as estimated by Weber, as well as much of the present Calchaqui Valley sequence, as al- ready proposed here. It now becomes a question of how to represent the periodization of the Santa Maria ceramic tradition in the two valleys. While giving credence to the seriations of Weber and Perrotta/Podesta, we conclude that it seems judicious further to delay precise chronological assig- nations to their individual urn phases. A scheme that more generally combines their findings with the dating and seriation of the present study thus appears desirable. Accordingly, it is proposed that the term Santa Maria be retained to refer to the late pre-Hispanic ceramic tradition of both valleys, and that the six-phase urn sequence of Perrotta and Podesta be used to distinguish an early - 12 A 12 B aX Xl d1!&amp; 12c 13 14A \ s Itl 1§11 19A 19B 19C 19D 1 2 3 4A 4B 5 6 7 8 9 &gt; g FOcm t 1S91s 14B 14C 14D 15A 10F | 100$1 10}1;.'1 X 16A 16B 16C 16D 16E 1 8A 18B</page><page sequence="15"> Journal of Field ArchaeologylVol. 10, 1983 25 (phases 0-II) and late (phases III-V) division for the Santa Maria Valley. The early division would fall in the Middle Period, with the late division corresponding to the Late Period up to Spanish contact. To denote the more localized differences between the two valleys, it is further proposed that the tradition be divided into North and South, referring to the Calchaqui Valley and Santa Maria Valley sequences, respectively. The northern Santa Maria tradition would also have Early and Late com- ponents, corresponding to the earlier and later site groups of the present study. Such a framework is presented in Table 6. The table includes the presently documented earlier complexes for both valleys as well, as outlined by Perrotta/Podesta, Nunez, and others. This proposed periodization would replace the more traditional Santa Maria I and II distinction, which con- veyed a simple tricolor versus bicolor ceramic se- quence.22 We now know that the tradition and its contents were much more complex, undoubtedly reflecting the complexity and variation of the local culture, of which the ceramics are but one manifestation. Non-local Ceramics Except for Inca vessels at the end of the pre-Hispanic sequence, there is very little ceramic evidence of interre- gional culture contact for the Middle and Late Periods. One sherd from the surface of the Valdez site does sug- gest such contact, and is of a sherd-tempered polished bowl with incised circles. Unique among the more than 6,000 sherds studied, it bears closest similarity in finish and decoration to a vessel illustrated by Puppo23 for the latter part of the La Cienaga tradition (late Early Period) of the Hualfin/Belen Valleys, located sw of the Santa Maria Valley. Another sherd giving evidence of interre- gional contact is a tricolor polished bowl fragment found on the Borgatta site. With its distinctive fine line black- and-red-on-cream linear decoration, it is almost certainly from a vessel of the Averias (or Mancapa) tradition based in the low-elevation Santiago del Estero region to the east of the Andes.24 Puppo places the Averias style in the Late Period between 1200 and 1400 A.C.25 The Val- dez and Borgatta specimens thus suggest at least a low level of interregional contact involving the Calchaqui Valley over a long period of time. For the end of the Late Period, Inca presence in the 22. E.g., A. Rex Gonzales and J. A. Perez, Argentina indfgena, visperas de la conquista (Editorial Paidos: Buenos Aires 1972) 37. 23. G.

This doc- umentation includes not only sherds of Inca vessels at many village and cemetery sites, but also sites of Inca origin (Cortaderas, Potrero de Payogasta) and a village with an intrusive Inca structure (La Paya). Although three non-local Inca wares were defined for the Calchaqui Val- ley on the basis of paste inclusions, the precise area of their origin cannot be determined; they may well be of Bolivian derivation. A black-on-red polished "llamita" bowl fragment from the La Puerta site, of "Imported Fine Ware," is virtually identical in paste to a similar fragment from the locality of Lasana in the Actacama Desert of northern Chile,26 and "llamita" bowls are most commonly reported for the southern Lake Titicaca region of Bolivia.27 26.

In assuring the allegiance and cooperation of local chiefs in the eco- nomic pursuits and demands of the Inca state, the Inca would routinely provide "gifts" in return, undoubtedly involving access to labor, textiles, and probably ce- rarnics.28 The relatively large number of Inca sherds found at the La Puerta site, at the southern end of the study area, may therefore reflect a special status for that village under Inca administration of the valley. Even though the settlement has no signs of actual Inca residence, its geo- graphical location at a natural "gateway" to the heavily populated middle and upper sections of the valley may have warranted special recognition by the Inca. The Calchaqui Valley and South Andean Cultural Development In late pre-Hispanic times, the Calchaqui Valley com- prised but one of many settlement systems that together represented a common pattern of South Andean native culture.29 It was a pattern in which sets of village com- munities that were socially and politically non-stratified were linked both socially and economically because of their close geographical proximity to each other and their common pursuit of agricultural and herding activities. The ceramic and other artifactual remains further dem- onstrate the cultural unity of the Calchaqui Valley set- tlements. Indeed, the beginning of the Santa Maria ceramic tradition denotes the emergence of Diaguita eth- nicity, a tnbal designation that was to be loosely em- ployed to refer to many groups in this region of NW Argentina at the beginning of the historical era. For dis- tinctionS one can thus refer to the Calchaqui Diaguita, corresponding to the late pre-Hispanic populations of the 28. See R.

In addition to the settlements and ceramics (including the complex symbolism inherent in decorated urns30), a common level of cultural achievement is manifested in the pre-Hispanic metallurgy of the region. Hammering, smelting, alloying, and casting of at least copper and bronze items of both utilitarian and ceremonial intent followed a long tradition for the southern Andes.3l Nat- ural resources for this development are easily found throughout the area, including zones close to the Cal- chaqui Valley. Metal artifacts may well have been part of a large interregional network of exchange, further binding together disparate communities and fostering similar cultural developments throughout NW Argentina and northern Chile. The physical environment was undoubtedly a limiting factor in this general development. While natural pas- turage for relatively large herds of camelids is easily found, the and and semi-arid landscape restricted the amount of land that could be cultivated, with or without irrigation technology, and the distribution of lands that could be cultivated was such that villages were not likely to reach great size. Correspondingly, the opportunity or need for the indigenous development of more complex forms of social, political, and economic structures was largely precluded. Even with the intrusion and domina- tion of the state-level polity of the Incas in the l5th century, the basic structure of Indian society was left intact, albeit reoriented to provide for the economic and political demands of a stronger and more regimented "foreign" power. The precise effects of the Inca on the local culture, in terms of such features as the social and economic status of specific settlements, remains as but one of the many problems that on-going, systematic re- search in the Calchaqui Valley will undoubtedly resolve. The Calchaqui Diaguita, as had all other populations of the Southern Andes, had developed a form of society well suited to the natural conditions of their setting and their pre-industrial technological base. As a major cul- tural form in Andean prehistory, it was at the same time both open and susceptible to incursion from afar. Being reonented by the Incas, it was eventually erased as a 30.

Appendix: Ceramic Wares and Their Significance Each ceramic ware was given a name for general ref- erence and identification purposes on the basis of the major class of non-plastic inclusion in the paste, and/or distinctive surface color or treatment. Fourteen wares are believed to be of local manufacture, while the three wares associated with Inca ceramics are quite distinct and ap- pear to be imported pottery. Twenty-nine petrographic thin sections were made for 13 of the wares, each to a thickness of ca. 30 microns. A basic description of each ware is given below, and a summary of the petrographic analyses, in terms of paste inclusions by ware, is given in Table 6. The thin sections and petrographic analyses were produced by James F. Olmsted and Robert V. Barry of the Department of Earth Sciences, SUNY, Plattsburgh. It should be noted that in the initial identification by low-power microscope and sorting of wares, sherds la- belled as "felsite" wares were later found to include a variety of generally dark, opaque rock fragments of both volcanic and sedimentary origin which were fully distin- guished only with the subsequent high-power, polarized light petrographic microscopy. The "felsite ware" label must therefore be taken only as a general identifier, since the specimens often include non-felsite material in the geolqgical sense of felsites being fine-grained volcanics. "Felsite ware", as used here, is thus characterized by major non-plastic inclusions that may be any of six rock types, alone or in combination, that cannot be readily separated by manual ("eye-ball") or low-power mi- croscope inspection.32 Accordingly, Table 7 lists the percentage of each inclusion separately, as well as a combined figure for the total of "felsites" that would normally be perceived through manual inspection of sherds. Several observations can be made relevant to geographical ware distribution. First, it seems clear that most wares are associated with specific localities, re- flecting relatively localized ceramic production in pre- Hispanic periods. Felsite wares (Felsite Ware and Felsite Gray Ware) clearly predominate at the northern end of the valley around La Poma, comprising 83% of all sherds from Pum Pum, 88% from Cerro Huasa Cienega, 83% from E1 Candado, 54% from Esquina Azul, and 84% from the Cacalar 1 cemetery. Felsite wares occur much 32 The importance of high-power, polarized light microscopy is thus emphasized when accurate mineral inclusion identification is desired. Also, as the results of multiple-sample thin sections in table 7 indicate, variation in the percentage of any given inclusion in a ware is to be expected. A single thin section should therefore not be taken as iStyp- ical" of a given ware. oo Figure 18. Localities with sites yielding more than 20% of certain less frequently to the south, comprising only as much as 17% in sites in the vicinty of Cachi and Payogasta. In- spection of sherds on the Cortaderas Alto site along the Rio Potrero NE of Payogasta, however, suggests that the ceramics of that locality also were predominated by fel- site wares. Mica Ware, virtually absent at sites around La Poma, is common from Payogasta southward along the Rio Cal- chaqui. It comprises 48% of all sherds collected at Mar- iscal, 37% at Loma del oratorio, 33% at Guitian, 21% at Borgatta, and 24% at La Puerta at the southern limit of the sites studied. Granite Ware also seems localized, being dominant at sites near Payogasta and in the upper reaches of the Rio Las Arcas and the Rio Las Trancas west of Cachi. It comprises 60% of all sherds from the Valdez and Cruz sites, 36% at Las Pailas, and 33% at Corral del Algar- robal.

It is noted that one's collection procedures will have a direct effect on the pattern of ware occurrence per- ceived for any given site. For the sites studied, surface collection procedures were relatively uniform, and spec- imens were gathered without attention to paste charac- teristics. It is thus felt that the ware distribution data presented here are a reasonable basis for comparison, at that level. The effect of sampling must not be under- stressed, however, as shown by the differences in ware frequencies obtained for the test excavation versus the surface collections for the Borgatta site near Cachi. All sherds were retained and analyzed from the excavation in the refuse mound, which yielded nearly 68% (combed) Sandy Ware sherds, ca. 18% Mica Ware, 10% Plain Ware, and 5% Gray Ware. By contrast, the surface col- lections yielded roughly 50% Plain Ware, 20% Mica</page><page sequence="20">30 The Prehistory of NW Argentina: the Calchaquf Valley Project, 1977-19811Pollard Ware, 12% Sandy Ware, 10% Granite Ware, and 2% Felsite Ware. Inca sherds were present on the surface and not in the excavation, and Sandy Felsite Ware and Black Ware were present in the test pit but not found on the surface, yet the number of classifiable sherds was comparable (1808 from the excavation, 1447 from the surface). The ware differences undoubtedly related both to the different sampling procedures, and to the fact that refuse mounds may contain disproportionate amounts of certain broken vessels (e.g., large utility jars), as well as representing only part of the site's occupation. While it is believed that the distribution of ceramic wares reflects localized production, no field study has been undertaken to pinpoint clay and tempering material sources in the Calchaqui Valley. Nor is it known to what extent the non-plastic inclusions in the wares were native to the clay or were added in clay preparation. Discus- sions in 1981 with a current potter in Cachi revealed that many clay sources both along and away from the river already contain sufficient temper (mica, felsites, etc.), while surface-minded tempering material is added to other clays. Mica, for example, is collected at Cerro Tin Tin to the east of Cachi and ground up for clay inclusion. The high mica content in the pre-Hispanic Mica Ware may well have resulted from the addition of that material to produce vessels with the distinctive texture and ap- pearance provided by the lustrous muscovite. With respect to the association of wares with cate- gories of vessel forms, several observations can be made. Sandy Ware, for example, was clearly favored for mak- ing combed utility jars, only rarely having been em- ployed for urns and bowls. By contrast, Mica Ware was commonly used for both urns and bowls, but was rela- tively rare in jar construction. Plain Ware was employed for all categories of vessels, but with a predominance in urns. A similar pattern can be noted for Granite Ware. Felsite wares were associated most often with jars, but were also used for urns and bowls, particularly at sites around La Poma. Black Ware was employed for both jars and bowls, while Gray Ware appears only as bowls. Finally, the three Inca wares were only jars and bowls, urns being a local vessel form. With localized production of ceramics, the occurrence of certain wares in sites at different parts of the valley may have two implications. First, intersite relations may be reflected, in which ceramic vessels moved from one locality to another, by whatever means (gift, exchange, theft, etc.). Second, differences in site chronology may be reflected, with certain wares being characteristic of particular time periods. When ware distribution is com- pared to the earlier/later site clusters of the seriation, several correlations stand out. Sandy Ware and Mica Ware are extremely rare or absent at sites of the earlier group, and except for one stray sherd on the Valdez site, Inca Wares are totally absent. Sandy Ware and Mica Ware are quite common, however, at sites of the later group. Similarly, Felsite Ware is dominant at earlier sites at La Poma and common even at early sites further south. Granite Ware dominates the early sites at Payogasta, but is extremely rare at the later site of Buena Vista in this same locality. The "early" chronological association of Felsite and Granite Ware is further suggested by findings from the Borgatta test pit, in which Granite Ware and Felsite Wares were totally absent from the excavated materials, but constituted 10% and 2% respectively of the surface collections at the site. Ceramic wares thus have both geographical and tem- poral correlations. With a sufficiently large surface col- lection (100-200 sherds) obtained by the field procedures used here, one could perhaps tentatively assign a relative chronological position to a site on the basis of wares alone. Red-on-Orange Ware (3 thin sections). This ware, used for jars and bowls, is characterized by a relatively compact paste whose major non-plastic inclusions are fine to coarse "fel- sites" ranging from 8.7% to 26.2% of the paste, with lesser amounts of fine to medium quartz and feldspars, and some micas. (Paste therefore grades from that of plain ware to felsite ware, described below). Vessel surfaces have low to medium polish, with a characteristic red paint on an unslipped or thinly slipped orange base, the red paint being broad, amorphous curvilinear designs that often have an almost negative quality given the closeness of the red paint to the underlying vessel color. The ware is similar to Tastil borravino sobre naranja ("Tastil wine red-on-orange") from the Quebrada del Toro,33 but which was used only for bowls. Firing: oxidized, carbon streak common. Felsite Gray Ware, Polished (2 thin sections). This ware, rep- resented by jars and some bowls, is characterized by a friable paste whose major inclusions are coarse to granular felsites (24.1-42.9%) with fine to coarse quartz and feldspars, and fine to medium calcite or opaques (oxides), with or without micas. Surface finish is low to medium polish. Firing: reduced (?), gray throughout. Felsite Ware (3 thin sections). This ware is similar in texture to Polished Felsite Gray Ware (friable); coarse to very coarse felsites dominate the ware (17.6-29.0%), with fine to coarse quartz and feldspars, rarely with very fine mica. Forms are jars, urns, and bowls; surface finish is usually well smootI2ed, 33. E.

Firing: oxidized, usually complete. Mica Felsite Ware (rare, no thin section made). Bowls con- stitute the only form. This rare ware is similar to the previous Felsite Ware, but also has noticable amounts of mica. Surface finish has a low to medium polish and is red slipped. Firing: oxidized. Sandy Felsite Ware (2 thin sections). Forms are jars, urns, and bowls (rare). The inclusions of this friable ware are marked by coarse to granular felsites (16.5-37.7%), medium to very coarse quartz (2.2-3.1%), and fine to coarse feldspars (2.7- 3.2%), with small amounts of mica. Surface finish is well smoothed, low polish and red slip rare. Firing: oxidized, usu- ally complete. Sandy Ware (2 thin sections). Forms are jars and rarely urns and bowls. The texture is friable and gritty, marked by a high occurrence of coarse quartz (7.4-10.5%) and medium to very coarse feldspars (18.3-20.5%), with lesser amounts of coarse to pebble sized felsites, and fine to coarse micas. Opaques (oxides) are also present. This ware is the main source for combed utility jars, and otherwise has rough to smoothed sur- faces. Firing: oxidized, highly variable. Firing and use cloud- ing common. Sandy Mica Ware (rare, no thin section made). Bowls are the only form. This unique ware is similar to Sandy Ware, but the quartz and feldspar inclusions are smaller, there is a higher mica content, and the paste is more compact. Possibly "im- ported," vessels are basket-impressed on the exterior surface, with an overlay of black-on-red paint. Firing: oxidized, complete. Granite Ware (3 thin sections). Forms are jars, urns, and bowls. Major inclusions are medium to very coarse volcanic rock frag- ments 19.2-23.2%) and fine to medium plagioclase feldspars (9.2-15.3%), which are white to pink in coloration, with lesser amounts of opaques (oxides), quartz, and biotite mica. The paste has medium compactness. Vessel surfaces are well smoothed, and usually decorated with paint; low polish and red slip are less common. Firing: oxidized, variable. Compact Granite Ware (rare, no thin section made). The ware appears only as jars. This ware is similar in the content of its paste to Granite Ware, but is more compact. Surface treatment is unknown, since the present specimens have eroded surfaces. Firing: oxidized. Mica Ware (2 thin sections). Jars, urns, and bowls are the forms. Major paste inclusions are medium to very coarse mus- covite mica (5.6-20.4So), with varying amounts of fine to coarse feldspars, quartz, and felsites. One sectioned specimen also contained tourmaline and oxides. Vessel surfaces are nor- mally well smoothed and decorated with paint; red slip with polish is rare. Firing: oxidized, usually complete. Fire clouding rare. Plain Ware (5 thin sections). This common ware appears as jars, urns, and bowls. Paste inclusions are very fine to coarse felsites (7.1-13.2%), quartz (2.0-4.3%), feldspars (4.2- 8.8%), with or without small amounts of micas. Paste is com- pact. Surface treatments include slip and polish, but most ves- sels are simply well smoothed and decorated with paint. Firing: oxidized, variable. Gray Ware (2 thin sections). Forms are bowls, and rarely jars . Paste is compact, with fine to coarse felsites ( 16. 8- 22.6%), very fine to medium quartz (1.8-1.9%) and feldspars (4.3-6.4%), and small amounts of mica. Surfaces have low to medium polish. Firing: reduced, gray throughout. Black Ware (1 thin section). Forms are jars and bowls. The paste of this ware is similar to that of Gray Ware in compo- sition and texture. Vessel surface treatment is also similar, with low to medium polish, but with black coloration. Some bowls combine a black exterior with a gray interior, and blackness may grade to gray on exteriors. Firing: reduced, gray core. Granite Gray Ware (rare, no thin section made). Jars and bowls are the forms. The ware is similar in compactness and surface finish to that of Gray Ware; the distinction lies in there being very few felsite inclusions, with more white to pink feldspar inclusions like those of Granite Ware. Firing: reduced, gray throughout. Imported Fine Ware (1 thin section). This category is com- prised of Inca jars and bowls. Paste is very compact, with only small amounts of very fine to medium felsites (1.85%), quartz (0.6%) and feldspars (1.9%), and some amphibole (0.3%). Vessel surfaces are polished, with or without slip and painted decoration. Firing: oxidized, complete. Compact Felsite Ware (2 thin sections). This ware is also prob- ably imported, and includes Inca jars and bowls. Compact paste marked by very fine to medium felsites (7.7-10.4%), very fine quartz (0.6-1.4%) and feldspars (1.1-1.6%), and occasionally smaller amounts of mica and amphibole. Vessel surfaces are polished, with or without slip and painted deco- ration. Firing: oxidized, complete. Compact Sandy Ware (1 thin section). Inca jars and bowls are the forms, probably imported. Paste is compact, with fine to coarse felsites (3.6%), quartz (3.9%), and feldspars (8.1%), with some fine micas and opaques. Vessel surfaces have low to medium polish, with or without slip and painted decoration. Firing: oxidized, complete.
