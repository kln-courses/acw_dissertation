<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY I THE concept of identity is of tremendous importance in human thought. It is true it functions largely un consciously. But that is all the more reason why it should be brought clearly to light. I intend to formulate a doc trine of identity which to me seems tenable and fruitful. In the present paper, however, my purpose is largely neg ative-to clear the way by disposing of a view which, though perhaps not consciously defended by many, has unconsciously caused much unnecessary trouble. I aim to show that continuity in space or time or relative to any one standard of continuity1 in general is not rationally required in order that identity may be legitimately predicated. I wish to use the term 'continuity' in a very common and inclusive sense. It can be defined as the absence of gaps within that which is said to be continuous. Let us analyze this a little further. A gap indicates both a presence of something and an absence of something. The first of these requirements is often slurred over. But if a gap meant the absence of absolutely everything, it would not exist and could not be said to occur in anything.2 Rather, a gap involves the absence of the distinguishing character IA phrase I shall define below. 2Compare Bergson's treatment of "nothing* in L' volution cr atrice, pp. 296 ff., which presents some analogy with what I say concerning gaps, though he places more emphasis on psychological factors, such as attention and purpose.</page><page sequence="2">534 THE MONIST istics of the discontinuous thing precisely in something which can properly be said to be in some sense contained within the thing, i.e., in that which has some characteris tic possessed by the thing throughout its whole extent. For example, to say that the line AB is discontinuous means A- -B that there is an absence, namely, of the narrow black mark on the paper. But this absence must occur precisely in that which is characterized by a characteristic which also characterizes the rest of the discontinuous line but nothing further ; that is, a discontinuous thing must in all its parts and in all the gaps within it possess a character istic differentiating it (including its gaps) from every thing else.8 To be a gap, the absence of the black mark must characterize a portion of the paper along a straight edge between A and B. Let us symbolize the distinguishing characteristics which are absent in a gap by D, and the characteristics present throughout the whole thing and its gaps, if any, but nowhere else by S. S is a region or more precisely anything taken as within a region ; it must be a va riable in the sense that there must always be the possibil ity of a distinction within its total extent between portions characterized by D and those characterized by not-D, and all its values must fall within the extreme limits actually possessed by the thing. Let us call S a standard of contin uity. This standard of continuity may be of very different kinds when applied to different things or even to the same thing. It may refer to inclusion within a region of time, of space, of colors, o correlates of various mathematical series, etc. But whatever it is, it is 'applicable' to a thing if (i) it does not characterize anything but the thing (in cluding in the thing its parts and gaps, if any), and (2) ^Usually it is necessary to express this characteristic in terms of cer tain maximum and minimum limits in order to restrict it to the thing and its gaps.</page><page sequence="3">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 535 all parts of the thing* are characterized by some value or values of it. A thing is continuous or discontinuous only relative to some standard of continuity. A thing is con tinuous if everything4 possessing the characteristic 5* pos sesses also the characteristic D. If we symbolize "a thing possessing the characteristic S" by s, and likewise, "a thing possessing the characteristic D" by d, we get the fol lowing simple formulations. Continuity = every s is a d. Discontinuity = some s's are not d's. For example, it might be said that a certain white is continuous over the paper I see before me. This is expressed by saying that every s (every bit of the paper) is a d (is characterized by the certain white). Or again, it might be asserted that the pitches of possible tones of a certain trombone form a con tinuous series within a certain pitch range. Here d = a pitch of a posible tone of the trombone ; ^ = a pitch with in the limits assigned. The continuity is expressed by say ing that every s is a d. Taking continuity in this common-sense meaning of an absence of gaps in that which is continuous, we see that continuity is essentially relative. We must distinguish be tween what is continuous and the standard in relation to which it is continuous. It might be objected that we ought to define continuity as an absolute not a relative concept. To this I would answer in general that the sort of contin uity whose relation to identity I am considering in the present paper is the relative kind expounded above, and if one does not care to call it continuity, any other name is suitable to me as long as the issue is clear. But for pur poses of clarification of what I mean by relative continuity (not for purposes of establishing it as the only legitimate meaning of continuity) I shall add here a few words on 41 use 'thing* to refer to a part of a thing or a group of things as well as to a single thing.</page><page sequence="4">536 THE MONIST the view that continuity is absolute. In the first place, it might be claimed that continuity means infinite divisibility, which is an absolute characteristic and which is not re quired by my definition. I reply that infinite divisibility is not always involved in our ordinary usage of continuity. For example, it might be said that the number of marbles in particular bags in a row before me increases continuous ly from right to left. This would be true if, e.g., the first bag on the right contained one marble, the next, two, etc. Here obviously there is no infinite divisibility. Or it might be said that Tunney was continuously victorious in the ring. This would not mean that he was always on the point of winning a match, but that in every case of his fighting he was a victor. Likewise when we assert that ether is contin uous throughout space, what we ordinarily mean to assert is not that ether (nor even that space) is infinitely divisible, but that there is nothing spatial which is not ethere al. The objector however might claim that even on my view, though what is continuous is continuous in a relative sense only, nevertheless the standard of continuity relative to which it is continuous must itself be continuous in an absolute sense. Whether or not this is true is irrelevant to my contention in the present paper, but I might state in passing that it seems to me to be false. A standard of continuity need not be continuous, and when it is, it is so only relatively to some further standard. When I say the number of marbles in the bags before me increases con tinuously from right to left, I do not mean that a portion of the series of positive integers (which can here be taken as the standard of continuity) is itself continuous. But it may be said that the mathematician seeks an absolute, not a relative, definition of continuity. To this I answer that I am not here concerned with mathematical</page><page sequence="5">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 537 continuity, though I think that it can be defined in terms of the relative continuity I am expounding. On the rela tivistic view of continuity, no assemblage is either contin uous or discontinuous by itself. But if we choose as a standard some characteristic possessed by (or assigned to) all members of the assemblage, then the assemblage is continuous if everything possessing that characteristic (or everything to which it could be assigned on the same prin ciple of assignment) is a member of the assemblage, but if some things possessing the characteristic are not members of the assemblage, then the assemblage is discontinuous relative to that standard. The series of positive integers is by itself neither continuous nor discontinuous. In relation to values attainable by the process of mathematical in duction it is continuous ; in relation to capacity to express relative distances of points along a line it is discontinuous. The series of rational numbers is continuous relative to capacity to express relative distances along a single line ; it is discontinuous relative to capacity to express relative dis tances along two or more different lines. But what, then, does the mathematician mean by categorically denying that the series of integers, of rational numbers, or any compact series is continuous? His meaning can be ex pressed by saying that, for him, only that series is truly continuous in which there are no gaps relative to any (mathematically significant) applicable standard what ever. Only a series so defined that it is continuous relative to every standard of continuity applicable to it is called continuous. This is perfectly legitimate in mathematics, but I think a wider application of the term is consistent with popular and even scientific usage. So much for continuity. I take it in its relative sense where it means the absence of gaps in something relative</page><page sequence="6">538 THE MONIST to some region of things or type of things. I shall not here attempt a definition of identity. That is a problem for which the present paper clears the way. But let me warn that I use identity in an ontological sense. To give some synonyms, I mean by identity a single concrete thing, an existent, a real entity. Thus obviously I am not using it to mean an abstraction, a sameness of two existents in re spect to some quale or relation characterizing both.5 But I must warn that this terminology does not indicate that I am a particularist or nominalist. I believe that identi ties can overlap and intersect in all sorts of interesting and confusing ways. Whether or not my definition of continuity and my use of identity are purely verbal (i.e., arbitrary on my part),6 if you grant them to me, my contention as to their rela tion is not purely verbal. My contention is that identity is not synonymous with, nor does it include as an essential factor, continuity relative to some one standard of contin uity. More particularly, a thing to be identical (i. e., one existent) need not be continuous in space, in time, nor in space-time (since these are the standards of continuity most often involved in ontological discussions). Spatial gaps in spatial things, temporal gaps in temporal things, are not always and necessarily incompatible with the iden tity of those things. There may be many identities that are continuous relative to certain spatial or temporal re gions. But just what these are must be determined empiri SThis is an arbitrary usage adopted only for clearness* sake. Identity and non-identity refer to existents; sameness and difference to character istics of existents; likeness and unlikeness to two or more existents taken to be the same or different in certain characteristics. 61 do not for a moment grant that they are. It is verbal what words you use for given meanings, but what meanings you thus symbolize is a mat ter scarcely ever, perhaps never, wholly verbal. And once your meanings are clear, their mutual relations are to no degree a verbal matter. This contention rests on the view that the function of thought is not primarily to construct an arbitrary symbolic language and calculus, but to analyze ex perience.</page><page sequence="7">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 539 cally. There is no formal or implicative necessity in the concept of identity compelling us to deny that an assem blage in which there is a spatial or temporal gap forms an identity. This universal negative I can hardly hope to prove. But I do believe that if its meaning is made clear it will be seen to be sound (by intuition, if you will), and that by its acceptance many fruitless and time-worn prob lems will be solved or at least made easier of solution. Moreover, no arguments purporting to prove that every identity must be continuous relative to some one common standard of continuity (such as a region of space or time) are sound. Let us consider some of them. Parmen des argues as follows. It is impossible that what is not, is. For nothing cannot be thought, and what can be thought and what can be are the same. Hence what is, is not divisible, "since it is all alike and there is no more of it in one place than in another, to hinder it from hold ing together, nor less of it, but everything is full of what is. Wherefore it is wholy continuous; for what is, is in contact with what is."7 Let us first (following a sug gestion by Robin) interpret Parmenides' position in as abstract and logical a fashion as possible. To say that not being is, is contradictory. Hence, since being could only be separated by not-being (i.e., the only gap which could occur in being would be that which is filled by not-being), being must be continuous. This may be made clearer by a negative formulation. If being were discontinuous, it would be true that both being and not-being exist. The consequent is here taken to be absurd, since being preempts the universe and not-being is simply complete absence of every character whatsoever. On this view, there is one standard of continuity (that which is or exists) relative to which all being must be continuous (since there can be 7From frag. 8, tr. by J. Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy, p. 175.</page><page sequence="8">540 THE MONIST no cases of what is, which are cases of not-being). On this interpretation, Parmenides' argument for the continuity of being would reduce to an identification of what is said to be continuous with the standard relative to which it is continuous. Predication of continuity becomes mere tau tology. What is, is continuous relative to what is. No one can deny this, but it is of no ontological significance and can hardly be seriously accepted as an argument for onto logical continuity. But may not Parmenides have meant that what is, is continuous relative to something else? Let us (following the lead of Zeller and Bur net) consider being to mean filled space and not-being to mean empty space for Parmenides. Then his contention that being is continuous becomes sig nificant. It means that all space is filled ; there are no gaps (no spaces which are not filled). But now that Parmen ides' contention has been made significant, his basis for as serting it is swept away. For his claim that there can be no gaps in being rests on the assertion that not-being is unthinkable. Now if not-being is the absolute absence of everything, it surely cannot separate or divide being, since it is contradictory to assert that such a not-being is. But if not-being means empty space, it is not self-contradictory to say that not-being is, and surely it can be conceived as forming gaps within filled spaces. Hence Parmetnides' contention that all being is continuous is either tautologous or groundless. Quite similar to the second interpretation of Parmen ides given above is Descartes' argument against the real existence of a vacuum.8 Descartes' position amounts to an assertion that matter is continuous throughout space. So far as this follows from his identification of matter with extension (that is, with space itself), it is wholly tauto SCf. Principles of Philosophy, xvi-xix.</page><page sequence="9">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 541 logous and cannot claim to be an argument. But matter is not merely extension for Descartes-it is extended sub stance. Might there not, then, be cases of extension where there is no substance, gaps in matter which are themselves extended but not filled with substance ? Descartes' answer is that nothing cannot be extended. Extension is an at tribute and cannot exist except in a substance. But when we ask why every characteristic discoverable in our ex perience must be taken as an attribute, as inhering in a substance, Descartes has no answer except self-evidence. This necessity certainly does not appear as self-evident to most of us to-day. Furthermore, unlike Parmenides' 'being/ Descartes' 'matter' is not the only kind of existent. In our own day we have E. Meyerson, who in many ways seems to be a contemporary Eleatic. His argument draws upon the vast storehouse of the history of science, yet is essentially simple. Any tendency common through the whole history of science, despite differences of speci fic content, must reveal an a priori principle of human thought. Such a tendency is that towards explanation. Always science has sought to explain phenomena, i.e., to find behind apparent changes an identical object whose characteristics have not really changed. Explanation is explication-an unfolding of what was there all the time. It is an appeal to a cause. A cause is a real thing, an iden tity, which not only persists continuously through the tem poral period in which the phenomena explained by it oc cur, but is itself unchanged. Thus gravity has been taken to be a continuous and constant force despite changes in the velocities of falling bodies. Science has ever sought for the continuous and changeless, and only when it has thought that it has discovered such has it felt satisfied that it has found something real. Meyerson's argument, though an attempt to give the a priori an a posteriori basis in the</page><page sequence="10">542 THE MONIST history of science, is nevertheless, if valid, a strong argu ment for the contention that every thing must be con tinuous (not to add changeless) through time. But is it valid? I think not. For as Meyerson himself urges,9 real ity opposes this tendency to explanation. If explanation were successful, it would explain away (deny the exis tence) of everything to be explained. And the history of science reveals another tendency, the empirical, which runs in an opposite direction to that of the causal tendency. Hence Meyerson's argument for the continuity through time of every real thing, as based on the history of science, is admitted to collapse. Mr. W. E. Johnson presents a somewhat different ar gument for the continuity of real things through time, though it likewise is based on the requirements of causa tion. As an example from physical things, Johnson argues that if you have two cases of motion you can assert that one completely determines the date, direction, and location of the other only if the motions are of the same particle and if this particle is continuously existent through the spatio-temporal interval between them.10 Taking an ex ample from the psychical realm, Johnson argues that a sensation can be conceived as casually determinative of the character and date of a thought process only if there is one psychical continuant (one mind) manifested in both.11 More generally, he asserts that "we can only speak of change or alteration by conceiving of an existent which continues to exist within both the periods of time to which the change refers. .. ,"12 As I take it, Johnson's argument amounts to this. You cannot speak of change nor of a cer 9(7/. Identity and Reality, chs. viii, ix; and De l'explication dans les sciences, chs. vi, xvi.

Now I agree that change and immanent causality imply an identical thing of which they can be predicated ; otherwise you have sim ply a discrete series of different states. But I do not find that the argument requires the temporal continuity of this identity. If the identity is really manifested in all the parts or states of the change or of the causal chain, nothing fur ther is requisite. Now Johnson might have argued that every process of change and every causal series must it self be continuous in time, and hence that the identity im plied by them must be temporally continuous, also. But he does not so argue and yet he feels he has established the continuous character of this identity (why otherwise call it a 'continuant'?). Most cases of change are directly ex perienced as temporally discontinuous,13 and I am not aware of any a priori proof that all change must be tem porally continuous. I must add that perhaps I have no right to use Johnson's position as illustrative of the doc trine I oppose. Although he does have his 'continuants/ he also has 'occurrents,' and occurrents are just as truly substances, existents (and thus identities, as I use the term), as are continuants.14 So much for general arguments purporting to show that every identity must exemplify continuity relative to some one standard of continuity (such as space or time). I am obviously embarassed for want of such general arguments ; g., I say that the hands of my clock change their spatial relations to the dial, yet I practically never observe them continuously in time through a period sufficient to include observable differences in these relations. It is obviously an inference to say that the relation changed continuously through any given period of time, i.e., that in that time there were no periods not characterized by this change. ^However, if Johnson's occurrent is continuous throughout the briefer period of time in which it exists, then his position is one to which I ob ject, for it then claims that every existent is continuous throughout the period of time in which any of its parts fall.</page><page sequence="12">544 THE MONIST the position I oppose is much more a widespread assump tion cropping out in all sorts of other and more special is sues than it is a doctrine upheld consciously for its own sake. But I might here call attention to a view which is somewhat analogous. It is a doctrine which I think is sound except in so far as it might be taken as establishing or helping to establish the position against which I am arg uing. It contends that the hypothesis that every identity is continuous in space and time (or even relative to every applicable standard of continuity) is of very great method ological value, especially for science. A good example of this contention is to be found in the 'synechism' of C. S. Peirce.15 This is a doctrine stressing the methodological and explicative value of the assump tion of continuity in all cases of difference. Discontinuity means the possession of ultimate or indivisible parts, and since any ultimate is something inexplicable, discontinuity involves inexplicabilities. Peirce contends that nothing should be supposed to be inexplicable ; discontinuity is never a legitimate hypothesis. I agree that it is valuable for purposes of investigation and explanation to admit the possibility of real continuity in every case of apparent discontinuity. But this of course lends no weight to the view that everything really is con tinuous, as Peirce recognizes when he states that synechism is a regulative principle, not a metaphysical doctrine. But I certainly disagree with synechism if it implies (as it ap parently does) that there is no value for purposes of inves tigation and explanation in admitting the possibility of real discontinuity anywhere. To refer to only one example, the hypothesis that action only occurs in multiples of Planck's constant has certainly been scientifically fruitful. 15Cy. article "Synechism" in Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology; also C. Hartshorne in The Monist, October, 1929, pp. 521 ff.</page><page sequence="13">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 545 In fact, every relevant possibility (including various types of discontinuity) is of value in determining scientific pro cedure.16 As to Peirce's claim that a discontinuity is some thing taken as inexplicable and hence to be avoided, I an swer ( i ) there are other meanings of explanation besides discovery of continuity, (2) a continuum on Peirce's own view is an ultimate and therefore inexplicable, (3) every explanation must presuppose inexplicable ultimates.17 I believe it is true that there are some things which must be admitted to be spatially or temporally continuous. For example, a mathematical cube would cease to be it self if it included a spatial gap. An hour (as a unit of measurement) would cease to be an hour if it were not temporally continuous. A unit of velocity must be spatio temporally continuous. Many such examples come imme diately to mind. But however numerous these cases are, we can never conclude from them that everything must be continuous relative to one common standard of continuity. Furthermore, the necessity of continuity in these things arises from the fact that they are not existents ; their con tinuity is necessary because it is a matter of definition. Therefore I urge that we need not accept as a rational necessity the continuity (relative to any one standard of continuity) of every identical, existent thing. This leaves entirely open the empirical question as to whether and in what sense any particular identity is continuous. But if existential identity does not mean spatio-temporal contin uity, what does it mean? That is a question still to be an I Peirce's ex cathedra rejection of atomic theories is a good example of the one-sidedness to which I object. Cf. loc. cit. 171 hops to present my view of explanation and inference in the near future. In connection with the argument that continuity is of methodological value, I might call attention to some remarks by A. Spaier on the supposi tion that mensuration requires continuity in what is measured (La pens e et le quantit , pp. 328-336). Spaier argues that measurement requires the homogeneity but not the continuity of that which is measured.</page><page sequence="14">546 THE MONIST swered. But I must postpone consideration of it until an other occasion. At present I am worried for fear I have been seriously jousting, as Don Quixote, with nothing but windmills. So again I wish gladly to admit that the gen eral arguments supposedly establishing the view that every identity must be continuous in time or space (or in some other fashion) are notably scarce and weak. I wish to overthrow the position not simply in its general form, but as it implicitly functions in men's thoughts as they deal with the identity of definite kinds of existents. And it does seem to me not only that this principle does so function implicitly, but also that in so doing it is the source of much confusion and of many pseudo-problems. To the more il lustrative undertaking of making this clear I wish now to turn. II Ever since Descartes defined mind as a thinking thing, the problem of psychical identity in the face of temporal discontinuities in consciousness has been important. Des cartes himself suggested that if I ceased entirely to think, I might cease to exist. However, he still retained a men tal substance of which thinking was the attribute; but as such a substance came gradually to be given up, the problem of how a particular mind can retain its identity despite temporal lapses in consciousness became very acute. Locke grappled with the problem. He tried to show that personal identity (as he called it) is not dependent upon the identity of the thinking substance. "But that which seems to make the difficulty is this, that this consciousness being interrupted-, and we losing sight of our past selves, doubts are raised whether we are the same think ing thing, i.e., the same substance or no?"18 Locke urges that these lapses in consciousness, though relevant to the lSEssay Concerning Human Under sanding, bk. ii, ch. xxvii, 10.</page><page sequence="15">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 547 problem of substantial identity, do not concern personal identity. "For as far as any intelligent being can repeat the idea of any past action with the same consciousness it had of it at first, and with the same consciousness it has of any present action; so far it is the same personal self."19 This amounts to the assertion that psychical identity does not require temporal continuity between its conscious ex periences. Such a doctrine has been the source of much a priori horror. It has called forth three kinds of rejoinder : ( i ) conscious experience is not really discontinuous temporal ly; or, if it is, there is something else at hand to fill its gaps : either (2) an Unconscious or (3) a set of neural traces. I wish to show that the evidence for these three types of assertion is extraordinarily weak, and that the true basis in all three cases is the uncriticized assumption that psy chical identity requires temporal continuity. Leibniz answered Locke's challenge by asserting that consciousness is really continuous. Its apparent gaps are filled up by individually insensible perceptions whose total effect rises above the level of apperception only in the form of a confused mass. One is never completely unconscious ; even in deepest sleep there is experienced at least a con fused sensation. "These insensible perceptions indicate also and constitute the same individual who is characterized by the traces or expressions which they conserve of pre ceding states of this individual, in making connection with his present state-"20 We must admit with Leibniz that we do experience confused masses of sensation, e.g., the distant roar of the sea where the sound of individual waves cannot be distinguished. But what evidence have we that every temporal lapse of consciousness is filled with at least iQLoc. cit. ZQNew Essays Concerning Human Understanding, tr. by Langley, p. 49.</page><page sequence="16">548 THE MONIST such confused sensation? It seems evident that Leibniz was convinced ab initio that such lapses must be filled or psychic identity is destroyed, and so he filled them with a type of experience which, because of its indistinctness, may be present where we do not suspect it.21 For Bergson, immediate conscious experience is thoroughly continuous. It is only because of a superimpos ition of our intellectual habits of treating all things under the form of the discreteness of space or of scientific mechan ism that anyone ever comes to suppose that consciousness is temporally discontinuous. The immediate data of con sciousness are in fact qualitatively as well as temporally continuous. Below the self whose mental states have been made external to each other by discursive intellect, lies "a self in which succeeding each other means melting into one another/'22 and whose inner phenomena "make up, by their interpenetration, the continuous evolution of a free person."23 We must, I think, agree with Bergson that much of our conscious experience does directly come as interpenetrating. But surely direct inspection warrants the assertion that there are some temporal lapses and some sharp breaks in the qualitative content of consciousness. C. S. Peirce is not content with such an appeal to direct inspection. He presents an argument to prove that con sciousness must be temporally continuous. His basis is the referential character of memory. A past idea I now re member must, though it is past, be really present as well. If it were only present vicariously, the present idea would 21 Leibniz also seems to appeal to a causal argument. Only percep tion can cause perception {cf. Monadology, 23), therefore the first perception after a lapse in consciousness must have been caused by a (insensible) per ception in the supposed gap. This argument presupposes that every causal process must be temporally continuous. Moreover, it rests on the doctrine that cause and effect must be alike. Both of these assumptions are question able, and both can be shown to have their roots in the desire to conserve identity, as I hope to make clear later. 22Time and Free Will, tr. by Pogson, p. 128. p. 229.</page><page sequence="17">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 549 have to stand in a representative relation to it, but relations between ideas can only exist in some consciousness, and there is no consciousness embracing the past and the pres ent ideas. Hence the remembered past idea must be both past and present. "That is, it cannot be wholly past ; it can only be going, infinitesimally past, less past than any as signable past date. We are thus brought to the conclusion that the present is connected with the past by a series of real infinitesimal steps."24 Thus Peirce's argument seems to be that since in a remembered idea we have something both past and present, consciousness must be temporally continuous. This is obviously a matter of identity ; the as sumption is that no element (idea) in consciousness can be identical unless it is continuous throughout the temporal period between its occurrences. And this assumption is not justified by Peirce. Why may not the past idea and the present memory of it be identical even though there is a temporal gap between? Leibniz, Bergson, Peirce agree in denying that there are temporal gaps in consciousness. Why do they hold that every apparent lapse in consciousness is really filled with conscious experience? Not, it seems to me, because it is obviously a fact, for it is not. Nor do they give any reason why we must hold this view despite the appearances ex cept that psychical identities must be temporally continu ous. And such psychical identities are supposed to be con tinuous not on the basis of their psychical character, but because they are identities. The real premise leading to the conclusion that there are not temporal lapses in con sciousness is that every identity must be temporally con tinuous.25 ^Chance, Love and Logic, p. 205. 25The advocate of the temporal continuity of consciousness might de mand what proof I have that there are any temporal gaps in consciousness, especially since it is obvious I could not have any conscious experience of</page><page sequence="18">55o THE MONIST There are those who admit that there are temporal dis continuities in consciousness, or at least in certain elements in consciousness, who nevertheless agree that these lapses must be filled with something. Psychoanalysts favor the Unconscious (or Subconscious) for this role. It is true that they force the Unconscious to play many roles, amongst which is that of the 'natural man' of a now defunct theolo gy, upon whom was saddled responsibility for all our evil tendencies. Nevertheless it is true that one of the most important functions of the Unconscious is to furnish a re servoir where forgotten memories, repressed desires, im pulses hidden from conscious recognition are stored up, or, using a more suggestive metaphor, are ceaselessly fer menting, constantly ready to explode through any weak portion of the walls confining them. That is, the Uncon scious endows with temporal continuity many mental ten dencies which are discontinuous on the level of conscious ness. Thus, for example, Sigmund Freud asserts, "It is a striking peculiarity of unconscious processes that they re main indestructible. In the Unconscious there is no ending, there is no past, there is no forgetting."26 Now one must admit that there is some empirical found ation for believing in the psychoanalyst's Unconscious particularly that furnished by types of behavior that seem to be decidedly purposive, and yet whose purpose is hid den from the subject, and which are often completely out of conscious control by the subject until some forgotten in cident or unsuspected emotion is connected with them.27 them. My answer would be (1) I have pretty good experiential basis for inferring such lapses, and besides, (2) it makes no difference to my con tention whether I can prove such lapses or even whether they really occur. For I contend that we have little reason to suppose that there are no such discontinuities unless we assume that every identity must be temporally con tinuous. ^Traumdeutung, p. 450, quoted by Wilfred Lay, Man's Unconscious Conflict, p. 49. 27(7/.

Why not be content with the various ob servable phenomena of conscious experience and overt be havior ? Evidently because of the desire to give the present behavior a present cause which is nevertheless identical with a past experience, together with the assumption that any such identity must be continuously existent somewhere during the temporal interval between the past experience and the present behavior. The evidence persuades us to admit a causal connection between past experience and present behavior; but it is only the assumption that iden tities must be temporally continuous which requires an Unconscious in which past experiences possess a subter ranean immortality. By far the most respected stop-gap for the lapses in consciousness and in elements in consciousness is, for modern psychology, the trace, particularly the neural trace. Thus, for example, G. F. Stout says, "In the very concep tion of an individual mind it is implied that present con scious process is throughout conditioned by prior conscious process, and this is only intelligible if we suppose that past experience leaves persistent after-effects, which continue when the corresponding consciousness has ceased."28 In so far as these after-effects or traces are neural, they are usually endowed not only with the temporal continuity lack ing in their conscious correlates, but also with a spatial continuity in virtue of their physical character. Hence they are doubly sacred in the eyes of the devotee of con tinuity. But what positive empirical evidence is there for such neural traces? So far as I am aware, next to none. 28Analytic Psychology, vol. i, p 2.</page><page sequence="20">552 THE MONIST There is good evidence that serious general impairment of the nervous system profoundly affects consciousness and may cause it to cease. There is good evidence that lesions in special parts of the nervous system, especially in cer tain areas of the brain, involve losses of special kinds of conscious capacity and experience. And this evidence may lead many of us to doubt whether a consciousness connected with a particular nervous system can continue to exist after the latter has been destroyed, or whether any conscious ness can exist in independence of a nervous system. But to claim that every conscious experience we have leaves (or is accompanied by) a neural trace, and that that neural trace persists continuously in all cases of recall from the time of the original experience to the time at which it is recalled, is surely to stride leagues beyond the available evidence. But almost everyone does it. Why? To insure the identity of the present with the past consciousness (or element of consciousness) by making something tem porally continuous between the two. If we give up the assumption that every identity must be temporally continuous, we shall no longer stand aghast before an identical consciousness or mind embracing tem poral gaps within itself, we shall no longer feel we must hurry forward with insensible perceptions, unconscious experiences, or neural traces. We' shall then willingly ad mit that there may be unperceived perceptions, an Uncon scious Mind, and untraceable traces. But we will not swal low these queer hypotheses on the basis that they are ra tional necessities. If we accept them, it will be wholly on the basis of empirical evidence in their favor, or perhaps simply because they are in fashion. The next sort of thing I wish to use as an example is causation. It may here be objected that I am leaving the sphere of identity (as I have defined it). However, I hold</page><page sequence="21">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 553 that a cause and its effects are parts or manifestations of one identity.29 This view I cannot here defend, so that I shall have to appeal to the reader's faith and good will if he doubts the relevance in this place of a discussion of causation. What I do contend here is that there is no ra tional necessity requiring us to hold that every cause must be temporally (or spatially) continuous with its effect, and yet that the chief reason why most people assert that cause and effect are thus continuous is precisely because they think there is some such necessity in this view. Bertrand Russell asserts that some cases of psychical causation may be 'mnemic' in character, i.e., may include a temporal gap. Russell's statement of the doctrine of mnemic causation is : "in attempting to state the proximate cause of the present event, some past event or events must be included... ."30 C. D. Broad, however, feels that Rus sell is here mistaken.31 Broad admits that observational ly ('macroscopically') there are mnemic events, and that the traces appealed to to destroy their mnemic character are "purely hypothetical persistent entities." Hence he appar ently wishes to object on rational, not on empirical, grounds. His reasons for objecting are as follows, (i) Mnemic causation is unfamiliar; it does not occur in the physical realm. But surely the unfamiliar may be a fact. And I cannot see that mnemic causation is unfamiliar. In the psychical realm, even Broad admits that it appears to occur frequently, and it seems to me to appear to occur almost as frequently in the physical realm. (2) Causation in general requires more than regular sequence, for there are cases of regular sequence which we do not admit to be cases of causation. (Broad uses Russell's example of 291 might refer the reader to Meyerson's Identity and Reality and De l'explication dans les sciences for a defense of the position that this has been the historically important view in science. SOThe Analysis of Mind, p. 78. 3IC/. The Mind and its Place in Nature, ch. x, especially pp. 440 ff.</page><page sequence="22">554 THE MONIST the sequence between the blowing of a Manchester hooter and London workmen's going to work.) This further ne cessary condition is precisely "a certain spatio-temporal continuity between the sequent events."32 I think Broad does here establish that causation requires something more than regular sequence. But that this something more must be spatio-temporal continuity is certainly not established by him. (3) In such mnemic phenomena as memory, there are no constant relations between the times of occurrence of the cause-factors, and this reveals "we have not got an ultimate causal law but only an empirical generalization of the very crudest kind."33 I grant that, in cases of mem ory for example, the time between an original experience and the immediate stimulus of its recall is not a constant nor a function of either term in the relation. But does this prove either (a) that such memory phenomena are not themselves (ie., without the aid of traces) cases of caus ation, or (b) that temporal gaps in causal processes are in general absurd? Of course if only those processes whose temporal relations are expressible (a) in accurate mathe matical formulae (b) in the character of differential equa tions are admitted to be causal, then (but only then) must this compound question be answered in both its parts af firmatively. (4) B'y far the most important of Broad's ob jections to mnemic causation is that based on the follow ing principle : If, whenever a condition C is fulfilled, E fol lows, and we have reason to suppose that C is not the suf ficient condition of E, then we may suppose a further con dition P persistent (continuous) throughout the time in which this is true. This is the only sorti of evidence we have for the persistence of tables when not observed, and it is just as valid for memory traces as it is for tables. Now 320/&gt;. cit., p. 456. 33/&amp;id., p. 459.</page><page sequence="23">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 555 most people do accept this principle, but I do not see any rational necessity in it, unless there is a necessity in pre serving the continuous existence of tables. Why may not P (the assumed condition supplementing C), instead of be ing persistent through the time between the E's, occur only once (at or before the first E) and yet be a condition of all the E's? This possibility can be denied only on the basis of a prior denial of mnemic causation, which is the point at issue. Russell advocates the possibility of mnemic causation in the psychical sphere only. He seems to think that there are reasons why we cannot admit the possibility of mnemic causation in the realm of physics.34 Here, if any event "is to cause another event, the two will have to be contig uous in time; for if there is any interval between them, something may happen during that interval to prevent the expected effect."35 If Russell is presenting his own view here,36 his argument is amazing; for it implies what he elsewhere rejects, namely, a necessary connection between cause and effect. For if causation be merely a matter of factual sequence, then we can simply say that if C, which as a fact is followed by E, had not been followed by E (if something had 'prevented' E's occurrence), then C would not have caused E; i.e., C though it is the cause of E, could have occurred without causing E. Hence to admit an in terval of time between cause and effect is simply to admit that we do not know for certain before E occurs whether C will cause it or not. 34Perhaps one reason is that Russell, accepting a neutral monism, is glad to grasp any difference which will help him distinguish between the subject-matter of psychology and that of physics. 3&amp;The Analysis of Mind, p. 94. 361 am not sure; perhaps he is simply expressing the traditional demand for necessity in causation as it now gets expressed in differential laws. Com pare the following: "Causal laws may all be differential equations, but the grounds for thinking that they are must be empirical, not a priori" (The Analysis of Matter, pp. 107-108).</page><page sequence="24">556 THE MONIST W. E. Johnson definitely accepts the doctrine of the continuity of cause and effect. "The universal positional relation, as it may be called, of cause to effect is that of contiguity, which is to be conceived in the form of the co incidence of the temporal or spatial boundary of that which constitutes the cause with that which constitutes the effect. This absolute contiguity disallows any gap between the cause process and the effect process; so that contiguity is strictly defined as equivalent to continuity."37 What rea son has he for such a doctrine ? First, he claims that, since space and time are continuous, movement within them is. However, he does not undertake to prove that space and time are continuous (probably because he confuses physi cal space and time, which alone are relevant to causation though their continuity has not been established, with mathematical space and time, taken as continuous by de finition.)38 And it surely does not follow from the contin uity of space and time that movement within them must must be continuous (unless, again, the movement in quest ion is simply a mathematical definition, in which case its relevance to causation is not established).39 However, Johnson also appeals to a traditional argument : if there is a temporal (or spatial) gap between cause and effect, then the cause must operate after it has ceased to exist (or in a place where it is not).40 The consequent here is taken as absurd. Why? Apparently because it involves the concept of a cause's operating over a temporal or spatial gap. But why assume that a cause must operate upon its efifect? If by 'operate' is meant 'transmit motion by physical contact/ then we surely may question whether every cause must operate upon its effect {e.g., where the cause is an emission 3?Logic, pt. i, pp. xxxvi-xxxvii. 38C7. op. cit., pt. iii, pp. 163-164. 39And even though all movement is continuous in space and time, it doesn't directly follow that all causation is. ioibid., pp. 74-75.</page><page sequence="25">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 557 of electro-magnetic waves and the effect is their absorp tion).41 And if 'operate' is given a more anthropomorphic significance, it seems all the more obvious that some causes may not operate upon their effects. Johnson also suggests42 that if the causal process is temporally continuous, then we can take the amount of change in the process to be a func tion of the time. However, nature may not, in this matter, conform to what would for us be mathematically the most convenient type of relation. The empirical appearances indicate that some causal series (especially in the psychical realm) are not spatially and temporally continuous. Why have men so valiantly argued that they must all be continuous, nevertheless? Evidently because they thought there was some rational necessity of continuity in causation. Their ultimate ground, as I see it, has been the tacit one that identity must be char acterized by spatial and temporal continuity, and that the real cause forms an identity with its effect. In any case, I have not yet discovered any convincing proof that every causal process must be continuous in space and time. And if we relinquish this necessity, many baffling theoretical problems, especially in psychology, will turn out to be com paratively minor matters awaiting further empirical in vestigation. Let us turn to certain entities in the subject-matter of physics for further illustration. Take action at a distance in the case of the 'force of gravity. This has proved a scan dal in physics ever since first expressed.43 Meyerson sum 4lin fact I can see no reason why we must admit that what we ordi narily call physical contact (i.e., experienced contact) is such that the two bodies really are spatially continuous; there may be an unobserved gap. 42C7. ibid., pp. 76-77. 43Newton, in a letter to Bently, said, "That gravity should be innate, in herent and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else_ is to be so great an absurdity that I believe no man, who has in philosophi cal matters a competent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it" (quoted by V. Lenzen, The Nature of Physical Theory, p. 155).</page><page sequence="26">558 THE MONIST marizes the resistance by physicists to this idea.44 It was due, he claims, to the fact that such action at a distance im plies a leap in space (a spatial discontinuity in the force). But there is at least one contemporary physicist who is not overawed by the philosophical absurdity of a leap in space such as is involved in action at a distance. P. W. Bridgman says, "Now of course it is a matter for experi ment to decide whether any physical reality can be as cribed to a medium which makes gravitation possible by the action of its adjacent parts, but I can see no justifica tion whatever for the attitude which refuses on purely a priori grounds to accept action at a distance as a possible axiom or ultimate of explanation."45 I am in complete agreement with Bridgman here. Many fantastic explan ations of the transmission of gravitational force would not have been seriously entertained if it had been seen that whether any such force does exist between the bodies af fected is wholly a matter for empirical investigation, that the identity of the force at the two bodies is not necessar ily destroyed by the absence of this force in the space be tween them. As another example, take the transmission of light. Traditionally it has been held that light must be spatially and temporally continuous between source and sink. Hence in cases where light travels across apparently empty space, the latter was quickly filled up or a projectile was shot across it, in theory,-ether, electro-magnetic waves, light corpuscles or photons were called in. But there are scien tists to-day who question this view. Russell calls atten tion46 to a suggestion by G. N .Lewis that our difficulties in explaining the propagation of light may be due to the fact that we have no experimental observation of what we ^Identity and Reality, tr. by Loewenberg, pp. 78-84. *&amp;The Logic of Modern Physics, p. 46. 4677K? Analysis of Matter, pp. 125 ff.</page><page sequence="27">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 559 are trying to explain (we cannot observe light between source and sink). Russell himself definitely accepts it as possible that nothing whatever occurs between emission and absorption of light. Bridgman, urged on by the exi gences of his operational logic, goes even further and claims that it is meaningless to assert that light travels.47 This, however, is too extreme a position. For it is possi ble we may devise a method of observing light other than by interposing screens. It seems to me possible both that light is continuous between source and sink and that we may discover that it is. Nevertheless its discontinuity is not an impossibility. Why have so many held that it is? Basically, because of the assumption that the identity of the emitted ray and the absorbed ray requires a spatial continuity between the two. There are however certain difficulties in the view that light does not travel. How can one who accepts it retain the principle of the conservation of energy, for energy is lost temporarily between emission and absorption and ab solutely if there is radiation into the void ? Frankly, I must admit that if one accepts the principle that there is no light between emission and absorption, one must deny the prin ciple of the conservation of energy, or interpret the latter as applying only to averages. But unless we are already a priori certain that the principle of the conservation of energy is true, surely the fact that we have not observed light during propagation indicates the possibility that in this case so much energy has really disappeared. Another difficulty is the question as to why a ray reflected back to its source gets there after it was emitted, assuming that the ray does not travel. This question however obviously assumes that light cannot be temporally discontinuous. Empirical observations give light a finite velocity. Hence, WThe Logic of Modern Physics, pp. 150-166.</page><page sequence="28">56o THE MONIST if it is spatially discontinuous, it must be temporally dis continuous also (here differing from gravity). But I do not see why we cannot accept this implication. Let us consider physical space and time themselves. Here, supposedly, we can be certain of continuity. How can there be a gap in space-it would have to be filled with space in order to be a gap in space. It is true that neither space nor time can be discontinuous relative to itself. But if my analysis of the relativity of continuity be accepted, it is clear that neither is continuous (in any but a tautologi cal sense) relative to itself. Now it may be that space and time really are continuous relative to every applicable standard, but I do not see that we can prove this a priori. They may be discontinuous relative to some standard. Let us take as standard any compact series. It may be that be low a definite unit of volume or of duration, space and time lose their peculiar characteristics just as truly as does grain when it is ground into flour. In that case, space and time would be discontinuous relative to the selected stan dard. This possibility is upheld by Russell. "We natural ly regard space and time as continuous, or, at least, as compact ; but this.... is mainly prejudice," he tells us. "The theory of 'quanta' in physics, whether true or false, il lustrates the fact that physics can never afford proof of continuity, though it might quite possibly afford dis proof."48 As our final example let us take the physical object of common sense (though the discussion here is also rele vant to such things as electrons, electro-magnetic waves, etc.). Tables and chairs and such appurtenances of philo sophers' studies are usually taken to persist continuously between the times they are observed and to occupy succes sively all intermediate positions when they are moved. ^Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, p. 140.</page><page sequence="29">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 561 Now this seems a legitimate assumption and it may be true. But it has caused hosts of problems, and hence it is valu able to realize that it is not a doctrine rationally required by the evidence at hand. Our evidence for the existence of such things as tables is, in the last analysis, evidence of their existence at defin ite dates and places, viz., the dates and places where they are observed to be. If, then, we restrict our statements about a table to those which have a basis in observation, we apparently can say nothing about the table's relation to times and places at which it was not observed. But even the most thorough-going empiricists have been afraid to admit the possibility of any real discontinuity, spatially or temporally, in the table. The good Bishop Berkeley sup plemented his own perceptions with those of other finite spirits and of God. Mill appealed to 'permanent possibili ties of perception' (on the supposition that possibilities could fill gaps in experience without themselves being ex tra-experiential). Russell has not hesitated to talk about 'ideal' perceptions. And Broad has not been ashamed to avail himself of 'unsensed sensa.' These empiricists have appealed to unexperienced experiences of the table simply because they have been mortally afraid to admit that the table could really be discontinuous in its existence. But is this fear rational ? It seems to me not. We may have dif ferent experiences of one identical table even though the table does not exist continuously between the times and places at which it is experienced. The difficulty is the un criticized assumption that to be an identity rationally re quires to be spatio-temporally continuous. Broad might contend that there is another argument for the continuity of the table. If, up to a certain date, every time I come into the room and look in a certain di rection I see the table, whereas after that date I never see</page><page sequence="30">562 THE MONIST the table when I come into the room and look in the same direction, I can then infer that there is some further con dition (which we can call the physical table) which is con tinuously fulfilled before the date in question even though the total conditions for my experience of the table were not continuously fulfilled during that time. I grant that this is one possibility, but I deny that it is the only one, that there is any rational necessity for our accepting this. It also may be true that the physical table exists only when all the conditions for experiencing it are fulfilled. Such an hypothesis appears startling. But let us note that if we accept it, it does not follow that the table is created by me, that I have complete voluntary control over all its condi tions. Some conditions for experience of the table may be quite out of my control and yet only be fulfilled wdhen I fulfill those conditions which are within my control. That is, all those conditions of the experience of the table whose fulfillment is out of my control (the 'physical' table) may be said to be fulfilled by me in the sense that they are only fulfilled when I voluntarily fulfill the other conditions, yet what the conditions are which are thus non-voluntarily ful filled by me may be wholly outside my control. The table may be brown only when I am in the room and looking at it, yet its brownness is just as stubborn a fact, just as unamenable to my fancies, as if it existed through all eter nity. If, however, this hypothesis seems uncongenially ex treme, it can be easily seen that we have no conclusive evi dence that the physical table exists all the time between the moments when we experience it. Perhaps it has an in termittent existence, its existence being broken by lapses during very minute periods of time. Or again, it may ex ist only at or before our first experience of it, not later. There are surely many possibilities. I simply argue that</page><page sequence="31">CONTINUITY AND IDENTITY 563 there is no necessity for holding that the table really is spatially and temporally continuous. In this second part of my paper I have pointed out var ious cases of existent things whose identity has traditional ly been taken to require continuity in space or time. I have not argued that these things are discontinuous in space or time, but simply that they may be, and that many ap parently insoluble problems would be avoided if we give up the assumption that every identity must be continuous in space or time. Nbw why is it that in the doctrine that every identical existent must be continuous spatially and temporally we have an obviously a priori principle which has practically gone unchallenged by even the most radi cal empiricists? Why historically has there been almost complete unanimity on the belief that any spatial or tem poral gap in a concrete thing destroys its identity? The reason is, as I see it, that, since the time of Aristotle at least, the identity of concrete things (as distinguished from the sameness of characteristics) has been almost un questioningly assumed to be 'numerical' or 'existential.' But may it not be thoroughly qualitative in character ? To this question I wish to turn in a paper on "Numerical and Qualitative Identity," which I hope will appear in the near future. EVERETT W.
