I have always believed that the best scholarship draws its energy, if not its inspiration, from contemporary events, on which it offers an oblique comment using the past as an implicit mirror for the present, and Lemon perfectly exemplifies this principle. When Lemon writes that ‘‘Cicero’s suspension of law and the manipulation of consensus reveal a ruler that ignores the state’s own form of governance’’ (155), it is very hard not to read Jonson’s Cicero as prefiguring former president George W. Bush, just as Lemon’s char- acterization of York as a man struggling ‘‘to remain decent, obedient, and neutral in an environment in which competing stories and alle- giances compromise objectivity’’ (75) reads as a kind of everyperson fig- ure for today, who is trying to make sense of the welter of competing stories and narratives about national security. I should also say that Lemon does not make these connections explicit, and except for a brief mention in the afterword of the late chief justice William H. Rehnquist’s view that the laws ‘‘will not be silent in time of war, but they will speak in a somewhat different voice’’ (quoted on 161), contempo- rary events are never mentioned. Even so, Lemon’s Treason by Words helps clarify not only the early modern period but our own, and there- fore, for both of these reasons, Treason by Words should be read by as many people as possible.

Pp. xiiiþ550. What does one want from a companion? In Jane Austen’s Persuasion (1816), the heroine Anne Elliot describes her idea of good company as ‘‘the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation’’ and is famously informed by her cousin Mr. Elliot that ‘‘that is not good company; that is the best.’’1 Readers of the new Black- well Companion to the Eighteenth-Century English Novel and Culture, edited by Paula R. Backscheider and Catherine Ingrassia, will find themselves invariably in good company and often in the best. Gathering essays by twenty-four distinguished scholars, the collection at first glance might 1. Jane Austen, Persuasion, ed. Patricia Meyer Spacks (New York: Norton, 1995), 99. </page> <page sequence="2"> 138 M O D E R N P H I L O L O G Y seem to offer not one but many companions, but the clever, well- informed company assembled here has many interests and preoccupa- tions in common: from the history of the novel in its global and trans- national contexts to its role in imagining communities (the nation, the empire, the public sphere), from the novel’s place in the print market- place and its circulation as a material object to the representation of hitherto marginalized voices and populations on its pages. The con- junction ‘‘and’’ that joins novel to culture in the title reflects the criti- cal methodology—a theoretically informed cultural studies/historicist model—employed by most of the essays in the Companion. The individ- ual contributions not only offer incisive, insightful perspectives on the relation between the novel and the broader culture of the period but also usefully illustrate transformations across the century, singling out individual examples from different temporal slices in order to locate generic and thematic changes in shifting historical contexts, while the volume as a whole presents a wonderful panorama of current discussions animating the field. The entries are cross-referenced in an effort to show how the seemingly discrete purchase points of various contributions are part of a broader conversation within eighteenth-century studies. Those who expect their paid companion (and at a list price of $199.95, the companionship promised in this volume does not come cheap) to fetch and carry facts about authors and texts or to shepherd them through a cursory grand tour of the standard landmarks of eighteenth- century novel history should look elsewhere. Since the volume, as Ingras- sia observes in the introduction, is not designed to be encyclopedic in its coverage, there are, for example, no essays devoted to a single author, and the short and long shrift given to various authors is a reflection of the current scholarly canon. Giovanni Paolo Marana and Antoine Galland supplant John Bunyan, Miguel de Cervantes, and Madeleine de Scude ́ry as progenitors of the novel (although Marie-Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, Comtesse de Lafayette’s Princesse de Cle`ves [1678] plays a key role in Paula Backscheider’s essay), while Eliza Haywood and Mary Wollstone- craft receive greater emphasis than Frances Burney or Jane Austen. A handful of the chapters do engage in the somewhat thankless labor of the companion as a critical reference work, although these rather inconclu- sive surveys of the status of the scholarly literature are, to my mind at least, some of the less satisfying essays in the volume. The introductory essay by Catherine Ingrassia presents a useful survey of novel criticism and raises the question of how the essays in the volume ‘‘challenge, revise, or resist previous inquiries into the eighteenth-cen- tury novel’’ (1). Although Ingrassia claims that the ‘‘essays upend some of the traditionally held ‘truths’ about the novel that students and schol- ars have all too often used as a kind of critical shorthand’’ (1), it is not </page> <page sequence="3"> Book Reviews 139 clear that the Companion marks a break with or a methodological shift away from these predecessors: some of the doors purportedly kicked open have been unlocked and even ajar for some time. The collection offers us a more useful critique of things as they are—an illuminating examination of current subtending assumptions and the ide ́es rec ̧ues that they perpetuate—and a sense of the individual and collective proj- ects engaging prominent scholars in the field than a reformulation of the questions that define eighteenth-century studies. I think this is a measure of a certain consensus in the field, not a reflection on the qual- ity of the volume. Novelty, as a number of the essays remind us, is not an unequivocal good unto itself by any means. And if the Companion’s predecessors have addressed some of the same questions, few have cov- ered quite the quantity of terrain traversed in this collection. Moreover, the various truths (now) universally acknowledged in studies of the novel—that the critical teleology toward domestic realism is problem- atic; that the novel must be thought in light of its transnational, dias- poric, and even global origins and circulation; that other genres shape its formation; that underrepresented populations and perspectives demand analysis; that we must attend to the politics of form as well as content—are often piously enumerated rather than deployed in sus- tained and insightful critical readings, as is the case in the best of the essays here. The essays that open the volume emphasize both non-English and non-Western influences upon the novel. Robert Markley’s opening essay takes on our understanding of Robinson Crusoe as that useful lynch- pin that enables us to write ‘‘the history of modern identity, the rise of the novel, and the rise of financial capitalism in mutually constitutive and mutually reinforcing terms’’ (25), arguing that this narrative only holds up if we single out volume 1 of the text and ignore the two sequels. Markley compellingly argues that Crusoe’s global travels in the later volumes raise the specter of Chinese economic superiority, undermining the narrative of triumphant capitalism and British superi- ority and self-sufficiency celebrated in volume 1. Similarly challenging accounts of the novel’s genealogy as a vertical narrative of national and generic consolidation, Srinivas Aravamudan uses the trope of spying in surveillance chronicles, pseudoethnographies, oriental tales, and secret histories such as Marana’s Turkish Spy (1684) to reinterpret the early novel in its horizontal transnational relations. Drawing attention to the centrality of linguistic and cultural translation to the history of the novel, Aravamudan exposes the way current readings of the English novel rewrite the dynamic, ambivalent identities presented in these self-reflexive texts—these provisional translations, these ‘‘cultural trans- portation devices’’ of novelty (71)—into continuous narrative and stable </page> <page sequence="4"> 140 M O D E R N P H I L O L O G Y identities in order to recuperate ‘‘the protocols of a national realism that render the domestic novel centripetal and unitary’’ (50). Ros Ballaster’s essay on the oriental tale likewise draws on Marana to remind us that fic- tion was a ‘‘fabricated import.’’ Focusing on the structures of imaginative identification or ‘‘transmigration’’ put into place in these texts, Ballaster traces the transformation of the oriental tale from a critique of absolut- ism focused predominantly on Catholic France and despotic Eastern potentates to a late-century British ‘‘native’’ oriental tale inculcated with the conduct book values of a ‘‘reformed’’ English masculinity and a he- roic femininity—a sign, in Ballaster’s words, of ‘‘the strength and adapt- ability of an emergent ‘Britishness’ that . . . could speak from and of the place of the ‘other’’’ (76). The degree to which the novel could absorb or appropriate other voices also surfaces in Toni Bower’s essay on the transformation in seduction tales from the predominantly Tory political allegories of national union between 1660 and 1760 to the sexual politics analyzed by radical writers of the 1790s. Arguing that the questions of coercion and consent, collusion and resistance, raised in ostensibly apolit- ical seduction stories serve as cover stories for tales of monarchical suc- cession following the legislative invention of Great Britain in 1707, Bowers sees seduction fiction as part of an ‘‘effort (or refusal) to imagine differ- ence within ‘British’ identity—difference of gender, ethnicity, partisan identity, or political ideology, for example—and to mark out (or deny) possible agencies for Britons marked as ‘other’ and subordinated by those in positions of dominance’’ (142). By contrast, Elizabeth Maddock Dil- lon’s essay—the only one devoted to American literature—claims that seduction narratives should be read not (or not only) as allegories of national identity in the American context but as responses to colonial relations and a global marketplace. Arguing that ‘‘the formal innovation of the realist novel as well as its nationalist associations emerge against the ground of the colonial world market’’ (236), Dillon examines the way domestic plots involving incest and miscegenation process disquiet about the circulation of persons and the cohesiveness of communities in the face of transnational, specifically colonial, exchanges. A number of essays in the volume suggest the inadequacy of cate- gories and abstractions employed in literary analysis and propose new analytic rubrics. Thus, Devoney Looser’s essay on Maria Edgeworth presents old age as a missing category of analysis, evident not only in the ways unrecognized ageist biases shape critical appraisals of literary value and of authorial legitimacy to write on certain topics but also in the way periodization tacitly consigns to oblivion the works composed by writers who live and write beyond their literary moment or move- ment. Adam Potkay’s essay on joy and happiness is an exemplary study of how the transformation of keywords may serve to delineate the </page> <page sequence="5"> Book Reviews 141 complex history of affect. Other essays turn away from the individual— that staple of novel studies—to consider aggregates and multitudes and the literary representation of collective traumas and mass suffering. Fo- cusing on the connection between the novel’s representation of the large-scale displacement of populations and the construction of people as values, as units of labor, as mobile masses, as material bodies, in the emerging discipline of demography, Charlotte Sussman analyzes the way different representational strategies in the novel (realism, senti- mental narrative, Gothic historicism) elaborate a relationship between memory and place that mends the spatial and temporal displacement— the loss—entailed by forced migration or exile. Homelessness is like- wise the focus of Ruth Perry’s essay, which analyzes how common but unnoticed scenes of rent distress and eviction in novels raise urgent issues about the literal and figurative landscape in the period: about the inequities of ownership and disenfranchisement, about the political ramifications of novelistic setting and description, and about the human need not for the relative luxury of a room of one’s own but simply for a room, a bed, a literal space capable of serving as shelter from the ele- ments. If the suffering of great masses is often slighted in novels and in critical work on them, so too is the agency of crowds or of the mob. Carol Houlihan Flynn reads the absence of the Gordon Riots from eighteenth- century fiction as an index of the capacity of the novel to recognize and process civic violence: a collective act of forgetting that is part of a ‘‘greater national effort to imagine an impregnable Britain’’ (470). Other essays in the volume focus less on what is (or is not) repre- sented in the novel than the way novels were (or were not) read. Drawing attention to our anachronistic construction of literacy, Paula McDowell shows how modern faith in literacy as an unquestioned good blinds us to the fact that eighteenth-century writers often depicted it not as a progres- sive agent of change but as a dangerous or superfluous skill. Kathryn King’s meticulous reconstruction of the Aaron Hill circle relocates Eliza Haywood in a philosophical and literary coterie that brings out her endeavor to transport the sublime into prose genres, offering an illumi- nating critique of how the way the hypothetical readers devised to create a heuristic of eighteenth-century reading practices smuggle a host of assumptions about literary value and the desires of different genders, ranks, and classes into the critical project. Correcting the assumption that critics in the magazines adhered to a polite imperative to treat female authors with gallantry, Laura Runge’s research on the major lit- erary reviews demonstrates that they treated significant female-authored novels with critical rigor and acumen in the period of universal coverage before the emergence of the Edinburgh Review. John Richetti’s essay on the canonization of women writers reminds us that the question of ‘‘what </page> <page sequence="6"> 142 M O D E R N P H I L O L O G Y we read for ’’ may alternately shape and occlude appraisals of literary value, as he argues for the ‘‘superior socio-cultural fullness and density’’ of Daniel Defoe’s Roxana (1724) over Haywood’s Love in Excess (1719– 20)—a superiority that he argues issues from Defoe’s more extensive mas- culine access to the means of literary and intellectual production (370). A number of essays build on the useful cautionary notes offered by Jan Fergus and Paula McDowell regarding the overambitious claims made for and about novels, which made up an estimated 1.1 percent of book and pamphlet production from 1720–29, rising to a scant 4 percent by 1770 (344). Christopher Flint’s provocative essay addresses the ways the inflation of the novel’s importance distorts our sense of eigh- teenth-century print culture, leading critics to disregard other forms of production (‘‘amateur, patronized, polemical, educational, collaborative, oral, coterie, and manuscript’’ [345]), alternate modes of access (not only circulating libraries but also parish libraries, bookstalls, stationers, and cir- cuits of informal circulation among family members and acquaintances), and reading practices (intensive and extensive reading, silent reading, and written literacy). The fact that other social transactions are embroiled in the circulation and consumption of books suggests the existence not of a single public sphere but of multiple spheres of public opinion. Although the essays for the most part do not lavish attention on form, a number of the essays in the third section of the volume, with its catchall title, ‘‘The Novel’s Modern Legacy,’’ address how constitutive elements of the novel—plot, setting, character, voice—might be con- joined to social and political inclusions and exclusions of different classes of people, particularly in the latter half of the century. Thus, George Haggerty argues that Gothic stylization and conventions gener- ate a queer world that serves as a testing ground for unauthorized genders and sexualities, while Roxann Wheeler focuses on character sketches in the novel, arguing that attention to the body’s surfaces mixes physiognomy and natural history in ways that foster national and racial taxonomies. Drawing on Maria Edgeworth, Hannah More, and Jane Marcet, Kathryn Sutherland examines the distribution of voices in the novel as a sociable and dialogic interrelationship that might be organized around the auricular as well as the written, allowing what she sees as a feminized hearing to be placed in relation with a masculinized seeing. The notion of voice returns in Sue Lanser’s ‘‘The Novel Body Politic,’’ among the most powerful and provocative essays in the vol- ume. Drawing on Jacques Rancie`re’s definition of politics as what hap- pens when a body or a group is shifted from ‘‘its assigned place as a non- part(y) into the part(y) of universal humanity’’ (483), Lanser argues that certain formal qualities of the novel—its emphasis on an individual story, its stress on speaking voice, the flexibility and multiplicity of the </page> <page sequence="7"> Book Reviews 143 voices it represents—confer upon the genre a ‘‘special capacity to redistri- bute social bodies through its deployment of their speech, constituting or pre-constituting a politics in Rancie`re’s sense’’ (486). Attending not only to the content of the novel but to the form, Lanser examines the way the speaking voice that confers subjectivity on women is cut off through the workings of plot (as in the death of Clarissa), through the confinement of women to private and domestic settings, and through the separation of empathy from political entitlement: the dissevering of what Barbara John- son calls lyric from legal personhood.2 That character’s voices become the ‘‘formal location for the novel’s most progressive impulse,’’ Lanser argues, curtails the revolutionary work of the novel by making the novel’s most progressive aspects ‘‘far more a property of its speaking persons than of the plots in which they operate’’ (494). In interrogating the capacity of lit- erary representation to change political representation or to leave it unchanged, Lanser’s essay demands that we rethink facile assertions about the political efficacy of the novel. Paula Backscheider’s concluding essay likewise asks what we think genres do both for writers and for readers then and now: how ‘‘forms come to be apprehended as reality, as pure concepts of understood experience’’ (531). Emphasizing the generic plu- rality of the literary world eighteenth-century novelists inhabited and to which they responded, Backscheider reminds us that many eighteenth- century novelists embraced and abandoned genres not only for economic reasons (the profitability of the theater, for example) but also because lit- erary consciousness functions as what Backscheider calls ‘‘schema’’: com- plex knowledge structures used to order, interpret, and communicate ex- perience and meaning, which move across generic and national borders and animate the dialogic relation between formal conventions and the novelty and immediacy of the world. The notion that genre operates both within and beyond the text, soldering inner and outer worlds and ‘‘com- posing multiple interpenetrations between text and lived experience’’ (506), suggests the ways that the readings of the novel proposed in the vol- ume may in turn generate schema that reshape critical practices within the field. Like a good companion of the human variety, a literary compan- ion not only should be clever and well informed, intelligent and lively, but should also prod us to reflect upon the way we read now and the ways we might read.
