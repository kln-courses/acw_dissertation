<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 177 RufittiRufitti Presbyieri Liber De Fide. A Critical Text and Translation with Introduction and Commentary by Mary William Miller. Pp. xxii+203, 2 plates. The Catholic University of America Press: Washington D.C., 1964. $3.50. The Liber de Fide was first printed in 1650 by Sirmond at Paris, and again in 1673 by Gamier, under the name of Rufinus, presbyter, of Palestine and was thought (without good reason) to be the work of Rufinus of Aquileia. Sister Miller proposes, in this Ph.D. thesis, to ascribe it to another friend of Jerome, Rufinus the Syrian, who was sent to the West by Jerome (to plead at court for an accused person) and lodged at Rome with Pammachius from 399 to 402. This was per haps the Rufinus from whom Caelestius some years later claimed to have learned the doctrines now known as Pelagian. The title means not On Faith, as Sister Miller has it, but On the Faith,Faith, the objective facts of Christian belief, not the theological virtue. The book, taken as a whole, is a review of Christian beliefs couched in a series of attacks, always forceful and sometimes violent, upon doctrines and persons of whom the author disapproves. In his discussion of the divine nature we have refutations of anthropomorphism, and of Arianism with Eunomianism. Special attention is given to the consubstantiality of the Holy Spirit, though Macedonius is not named as the adversary. There are a series of virulent attacks on Origen, and refutations of Apollinaris and of Helvidius and Jovinian, with a rejection of Nova tianism. All this is supported by scriptural texts, not always applied in their proper sense. Human nature, the author maintains, consists of soul and body (he rejects the tripartite division): in respect of his body man was created mortal, in respect of his soul he is immortal. Adam would have had nothing to gain by eating of the Tree of Life: his sin affected himself alone, as is shown by the fact that neither he nor Cain ever sinned again. Consequently, children are born sinless, in the same state in which Adam was created. By baptism infants receive not everlasting life (which they have already) but only the kingdom of heaven. Chapters 46 to 49 summarize the reasons for the Incarnation, the chief of which were to teach angels and men humility and to re-create all (both angels and men) in Christ: there is no express mention of redemption or atonement. Evidently a book which so violently attacks Origen is not likely to have been written by Rufinus of Aquileia. One might also query whether so anti-Augustinian a treatise can have been written by any friend of Jerome. A few of its phrases are echoes of St. Augustine, and large «21.1 Ν</page><page sequence="2">178 REVIEWS sections of the book are a veiled attack on that father, who was too great a man for any to dare to attack him openly or to mention him by name. Sister Miller has done most of her work well. The Latin text follows perhaps too closely that of the only extant manuscript, now at Peters burg: there are places where Garnier's emendations ought probably to have been accepted. The translation is a sad mistake. Where approxi mately correct it sometimes betrays an insufficient command of English. But there are many manifest errors, which may become seriously mis leading. Three examples are given here out of many which could be cited. On pages 104-5: 'lam longe valere dicamus qui mortem malum appellant', is translated: 'we must say that those who call death an evil are in the great majority.' The correct translation would be: 'Let us now bid a long farewell to those who call death an evil.' Similar expres sions are used elsewhere to mark the conclusion of a section of the argu ment. On pages 120-1: 'Et non cognovit earn donee peperit filium suum, id est, non noverat certius quod ipsa erat virgo, quae Christum pari tura praedicta est, nisi post partus editionem documenta virginitatis eius manere agnovisset intacta', is translated: 'That is, he certainly would not have known that she, of whom it was foretold that she would give birth to Christ, was a virgin, unless he had known that, after the birth of her offspring, the proof of her virginity remained intact.' There is an unnecessary comma after virgo, and the sentence means: 'He did not assuredly know that she was that virgin of whom it was foretold (i.e. by Isaiah) that she would be the mother of Christ, except that after the birth had taken place he became aware that the tokens of her vir ginity remained intact.' This is not, of course, what the Evangelist means, but what the author perversely thinks he means. On pages 128-9: 'Sicut igitur Deus nunquam solus sine misericordia factus est postea misericordiarum Pater, sic etiam, non solus antea, postea unigeniti Filii Pater efficitur.' The version given here is: 'There fore just as God was never alone without mercy, later he became the Father of mercies, so also, not alone before, he later becomes the Father of the only-begotten Son.' This is not only heretical, but the exact op posite of what the author is arguing. Remove the commas before and after non solus antea, and translate, 'Therefore as it is not the case that God was ever alone and without mercies and afterwards became the Father of mercies, so likewise he was never previously alone and after wards became the Father of the only-begotten Son'. The same page contains two other errors quite as bad. E. Evans Ε. Evans</page></plain_text>
