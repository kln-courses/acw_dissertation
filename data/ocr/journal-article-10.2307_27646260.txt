Min Received: 10 October 2007 / Accepted: 10 October 2007 / Published online: 7 December 2007 ? Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007 Abstract In this essay dedicated to the memory of D. Z. Phillips, I propose to do two things. In the first part I present his position on the grammar of God and the language game in some detail, discussing the confusion of "subliming" the logic of our language, the con textual genesis of sense and meaning, the idea of a world view, language game, logic, and grammar internal to each context, the constitution of the religious context, and the grammar of God proper to that context. In the second part I present my appreciative critical reflection by arguing that the conception of context and language game must be made more dialectical, that the grammar of God needs more systematic metaphysical analysis, and that a greater sense of the radical transcendence of God over a language game is necessary in order to avoid reductionism always inherent in any contextual approach. Keywords Anthropocentrism Anthropomorphism Contextualism Form of life Foundationalism Grammar of God Language game Meaning Metaphysics Naming God Realism D.Z. Phillips Philosophy of religion Wittgenstein D. Z. Phillips has made many important contributions to philosophy of religion, such as defending the integrity of religious experience in its irreducible uniqueness, critiquing the untheological consequences of anthropomorphism in much of analytic philosophy of reli gion, and discrediting the instrumentalist and consequentialist versions of theodicy. It seems safe to say that central to these contributions is his insistent demand that we observe "the grammar of God" in all our talk of God. His work of over 40 years, however, has also been controversial, generating both loyal defenses and vigorous challenges. His theory of lan guage games and the grammar of God in particular have produced a variety of charges and counter-charges, contributing to the further development of his own theories and insights. In this essay I focus on his concept of the grammar of God or religious belief and his theory of language games on which that grammar depends. I will first present a discussion of A. K. Min (ISI) School of Religion, Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, CA 91711, USA e-mail: Anselm.min@cgu.edu ^ Springer</page><page sequence="2">132 Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 his position on these two on his own terms, and then follow up with my largely Hegelian and Thomistic reflections on some of the more controversial aspects of his position. My basic argument is that Phillips's concepts of the language game and the grammar of God are sound at their core but that they demand extension and development in three directions: (1) intro ducing more complexity into the concept of the language game in terms of more movement, heterogeneity, and dialectical tension with other games, without which a language game tends to be reified into a game fixed and isolated from all other games; (2) providing more system atic metaphysical analysis of the nature of God to spell out precisely the "absolute" character of the divine reality that Phillips so insists on without which the grammar of God tends to be something simply given in a religious form of life with far less intellectual self-reflection than actually has been the case; and (3) recognizing the radical irreducibility of objective and transcendent reality to any form of human subjectivity, individual or collective, including forms of life and their language games. Human language games are much more dynamic and dialectical than Phillips tends to believe; the intelligibility of the grammar of God requires much more "metaphysical" analysis than Phillips seems ready to allow; and objective reality, especially God's transcendent reality, remains the irreducible test of the adequacy of any language game as of the adequacy of any human concept, ideology, or products, to which both Western modernism and postmodernism tend to reduce reality in their anthropocentric preoccupations. In order to escape the imperialism of rationalism and positivism one need not fall into the anti-intellectualist, potentially anthropocentric empiricism of a fixed language game without metaphysics. At the root of so many problems in philosophy of religion Phillips finds our inveterate tendency, in Wittgenstein's expression, to "sublime the logic of our language," that is, to take language out of their normal contexts of application and treat it as an abstraction in a contex tual vacuum. The meaning of words and concepts is not autonomous but always mediated by their context. They make sense only in the context in which they originate and which does justice to their proper nature or character. There is nothing that is free of all contexts and makes sense for all contexts. To take things out of their appropriate contexts is to distort and denature their character in their specificity. The first order of philosophical business, there fore, is to specify and locate the proper context of application in which alone it makes sense to speak of a particular concept or problem at all, that is, to attend to the a priori conditions of its sense and meaning. It is no wonder, therefore, that so much of Phillips's books and essays begins with or at least is devoted to unmasking instances of subliming the logic of our language and specifying the condition or context in which a concept or a problem makes sense. For Phillips this confusion of subliming or decontextualizing can occur in a number of ways, by ignoring the proper context of a concept, regarding proof as an independent, external, and prior condition for the context of believing, or abstracting from all contexts. We ignore the proper context whenever we speak of God as though God were simply one object among others and try to apply the same logic to God that we apply to ordinary empiri cal things. We forget that the proper context of the speech about God is the religious context of worship, and God is experienced in this context as an absolute reality with necessary and eternal existence, as the graceful and loving creator of all things. The confusion of subliming or decontextualizing occurs when Gaunilo objects to Anselm's so-called ontological argu ment by appealing to the example of the "perfect" island. Such an island may be "perfect" but clearly lacks the necessity of existence. Gaunilo assumes that God is just another object like the perfect island whose existence has to be proved, without realizing that the very concept of God is that of an absolute reality with necessary existence. For Phillips, Anselm's point is not to prove but to clarify or elucidate the kind of concept we are dealing with when we speak of God's existence: God is a radically different kind of reality to which the logic of ? Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 133 ordinary empirical things does not apply. We cannot determine in the abstract whether it is fitting to speak of God's existence, any more than we can determine the fitting role of the king apart from the context of the chess game in which his role is played. Denying "existence" to God as atheism does because existence is always contingent is to apply the context of finite beings that come to be and pass away and ignore the specific religious context in which alone we can speak of the divine being with sense. In the eyes of faith God's existence is eternal, necessary existence; it is not necessity added on to an otherwise contingent existence simply externally and factually, as though God, without ceasing to be God, could just possibly be contingent although, as a matter of fact, he is not. Likewise, God is love, not contingently but necessarily so that "God is love" constitutes a rule for the use of the word "God." It makes no sense to say that God can be malicious although, as a matter of fact, he is loving. Separation from God is not a contingent consequence of sin; sin is?necessarily?separation from God. We also commit the confusion of subliming when we regard proof as a prior, independent, and external condition for the practice and context of believing. This is the confusion com mitted by epistemological foundationalism that regards the belief in the existence of God as something to be proven in order to serve as the foundation of religious life (1988, p. 12).1 John Searle, too?and many like him?are guilty of this when they present the prior belief in the existence of God as an explanation?not elucidation?for engaging in religious lan guage games. For Phillips, this is like trying to first prove the existence of the physical world before we actually use it for our many practical purposes. For him, we do not presuppose the existence of physical objects before we sit on chairs, set tables, and climb stairs, but rather show the reality of physical objects in such activities, which is the very context in which alone it makes sense to speak of the reality of chairs and tables and outside of which it does not. There cannot be a purely logical demonstration of the existence of chairs and tables, which then can also serve as the external foundation or basis for the context of sitting on chairs, setting tables, and climbing stairs. It is this context itself that gives concrete sense to the reality of chairs and tables and in which alone, therefore, it makes sense, not to "prove" in the sense of providing logical, external evidence, but to "elucidate" their reality. In the same way, we do not first "presuppose" God's necessary existence, as though it were in need of demonstration?in order to talk of his love and judgement. We show the meaning or sense of the talk about God's necessary existence precisely in the talk about God's love and judgment. Finally, we commit the confusion of decontextualizing when we abstract from all partic ular contexts and discuss issues and concepts in a complete vacuum of a concrete context and entertain the illusion of philosophizing for and above all contexts. This is true especially of metaphysical realism, which therefore can be regarded as underlying all other instances of subliming. Metaphysical realism asks the question of whether something is really the case, apart from all contexts and therefore apart from the logically prior question of what it "means" to offer a description of reality or to make an existential claim in a particular context, forgetting that what is so only makes sense in a particular context. Metaphysical realism tries to raise questions outside all language games. However, we cannot speak, for example, of "necessity" and "necessary" propositions apart from all contexts. It is not "necessity" that explains the various ways we speak of necessity but the various ways in which we speak that elucidate the status of necessary propositions. Even Norman Malcolm is guilty of this decontextualization when he summarizes Anselm's conclusion by saying that "God neces sarily exists." He puts the conclusion almost like a religious declaration or confession. He should have said, if he meant to be grammatical, that "in this concept of God, he is said to necessarily exist." The moral of all these examples is that "as long as we sublime the logic References without names are to the works of D. Z. Phillips. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="4">134 Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 of 'existence', we shall never appreciate what it means, in religion, to speak of the existence of the sublime"(1993, pp. 19-20).2 For Phillips, then, considering the context of application is essential for determining the sense or meaning of a belief. The meaning of "context," however, needs further elucidation. Phillips provides this by discussing the grammatical issues involved in the relation between belief and its object. The relation between belief and its object is not as straightforward as realists tend to make it when they say that "we cannot believe in God unless we believe there is a God to believe in," or that "we do not worship God unless we believe that God exists." The relation depends on the character of the object, which requires considering the context in which belief has its sense but which realism refuses to take into account. For Phillips, the context of application for belief is the context of actions and practices entailed in the belief. For realism, on the other hand, action is not internal to belief but only an external consequence of belief. To believe in a "true God" is to worship God, whereas to believe in a theory does not entail such commitment. By divorcing belief and practice realism makes any kind of believing unintelligible. Whether we believe in something is concretely shown in our practices and actions. What a belief amounts to is shown in how it regulates and illuminates one's life. This is not to reduce the reality of the object to our actions and practices but to locate the sense of our object of belief in its proper context. By emphasizing the internal relation between religious belief and the actions it informs such as forgiveness, thankfulness, and love, we are not reducing God to such actions of ours but rather locating our actions in the religious context of God's forgiveness, God's love, and gratitude to God. The relation between belief and its practical consequences or fruits is internal, not external as realism would have it. It is precisely in and through these fruits that God is operative in us. To believe in God is to love God because God is love. The fruits of belief are not secondary but essential to belief (1993, pp. 33-55). It is this context of practices that forms religious concepts and provides the appropriate condition for the sense and meaning of religious beliefs. For example, the whole discussion of the relation between grace and works and predestination makes sense only within the religious context where believers have a sense of sin, their inability to overcome their sins for themselves, and a holy and just God. Taken out of this context, and made a subject of abstract metaphysical speculation, the doctrine of predestination turns into the frightening doctrine of an arbitrary God decreeing an arbitrary destiny for human beings in ways wholly unmerited by what they do. Unmediated by a sense of sin and moral responsibility the doctrine of grace becomes a magical conception. On the other hand, within a concept of God as the creator of all things and of human beings as creatures who do not possess conditions of their own existence in themselves, grace means acknowledging the giftedness of all existence, rejecting self-absolutization as idolatry, and the moral obligation to care for others as fellow creatures in God. In this religious context there is an internal relation between grace and works. Grace does not "cause" good works in the way one object causes another, but acknowledgement of grace internally demands the good works of caring for fellow creatures as expression of gratitude for one's own existence. It is indeed the fruit of grace itself to be able to look upon all things as grace. Outside this context, grace becomes magical, and the nature of good works is distorted into an extrinsic means of attaining salvation. The perspective of grace changes our attitude to life as a whole, to works, successes and failures, praises and blames, loves and hates (1988, pp. 291-302). Constituted by a set of practices or form of life, every context also generates, for Phillips, a distinctive language game with its own world view, grammar, and logic. Every language game 2 For the preceding discussion of "subliming the logic of our language," see 1993, pp. 10-20; 1995. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 135 contains a world view or picture of the world, an informal system of basic propositions each of which depends on the other in ways that are more practical than logical, whose function is not so much to provide "evidence" and proof as to provide "elucidation" by "underlying" and shedding light on others that "surround" them. This means that the world picture with its basic propositions is not a theoretical foundation of what we think and do in the sense of providing the logical starting point from which everything else must be demonstrated as in evidentialist foundationalism. Rather, they are foundational in the practical sense that they are not themselves in need of demonstration but simply taken for granted in what we think and do while shedding light on other propositions that surround them. The meaning of belief in God, a basic proposition, for example, is shown in "the light it casts on all that surrounds it" (1988, p. 43). Just as we show our belief in the existence of other human beings by actually talking to them and dealing with them in many practical ways, so basic propositions and their totality called the world picture show their reality in the many particular ways of our thinking and acting. They provide the very context that makes our statements and actions meaningful, where we can make meaningful arguments and predicate truth and falsity, correctness and incorrectness of statements and claims. It makes no sense, therefore, to say that the world view as such or the basic propositions themselves are true or false, correct or incorrect, which would be to reduce the context itself to the level of a proposition and confuse the validity of a statement with the validity of the conditions of its meaningfulness. Our world views themselves are neither right nor wrong, any more than our languages, which make particular statements possible, are either right or wrong. "The grammar of a language, the concept of reality in terms of which denials and affirmations may be made, is not itself a belief or a theory about the nature of reality" (1988, p. 61). The criteria for judgment of particular statements are internal to this world picture, which in turn requires no external justification other than those practices that generate it. Whether something agrees with reality is itself a question that arises and makes sense only within a certain world picture. As for the practices themselves, they are "simply there as part of our lives" (1988, p. 33) or "simply there, like our life" (p. 25). Does the distinctiveness of a language game mean that it is so isolated from other areas of human life as to be sufficient unto itself? Phillips is aware of these and many other criticisms, and adds "misgivings" of his own about the recourse to the idea of language games. He wants to clarify, however, what these misgivings "amount to," to use his favorite expression. One misgiving people have is that treating religion as a distinctive language game might trivialize religion as something purely esoteric; religion should be regarded as something important and valuable. It depends, however, on what people do to make religion important. If belief in God is important only as a means relative to some human ends in the fashion of instrumentalism and consequentialism, this will be to treat God as a relative, not an absolute, value, and this will falsify the nature of religious belief. Belief in God is a matter of an absolute, intrinsic, not a relative, extrinsic judgment of value. Another misgiving people have about treating religious belief as a distinctive language game is that it makes impossible any justification of religious belief to non-believers on the basis of common criteria of rationality. To respond, Phillips appeals to Wittgenstein. Disputes are possible only on the basis of some common understanding. If someone argues that the sun is 90 million miles away from the earth, while another argues that it is only 20 million miles away, they are disputing about the facts, but they can meaningfully dispute because they agree on methods of calculation in astronomy. On the other hand, whether handling a ball is a foul or not depends on whether they are playing the same game with the same rules. Lack of a common understanding makes even disputes impossible. With regard to the ^ Springer</page><page sequence="6">136 Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 belief in God, this raises an anomaly: Do believers who affirm God's existence contradict non-believers who do not? Do they have the same concept of God? Believing in God is not like believing in the existence of unicorns, where those who believe unicorns exist contradict those who do not. God is not an object among other objects, the name of a thing to which we can point. The reality of God cannot be measured by a common measure that also applies to things other than God. Of other things it makes sense to ask when they came into existence and when they will cease to be, questions it does not make sense to ask of God. To ask such questions of God would be to treat God as a hypothesis, a probability, a relative reality. This does not mean that worshipers "just" believe that God exists. To worship God is to take God as an absolute reality whereby we are judged, not something we judge. The believer and the non-believer, therefore, do not mean the same thing when they talk about God, which means they are not disputing about the same thing; that is, they are not disputing at all. How do we know, though, that such beliefs are not forms of disguised nonsense which believers themselves simply fail to recognize? For Phillips, this is a serious misgiving. To respond to this question, it is not enough to say that every language game has criteria of meaning and intelligibility internal to itself, according to which we can distinguish between what can and what cannot be said, between blunders and non-blunders. A language game may be internally consistent and still be pointless nonsense as a whole. This points to a strain in the analogy between religious beliefs and games. Games may be distinguished and sepa rated from other sorts of games, but religion separated from other spheres of human activity and confined to its own purely religious formalities of worship will not have the absolute importance it claims to have and will cease even to be true worship. The very absolute nature of religion requires that it have something to say about all sorts of our worldly experiences such as birth, death, joy, misery, despair, hope, fortune and misfortune. Any sharp separation between religion and other areas of human activity falsifies the absolute character of reli gion. The force of religious belief depends, in part, on understanding the sense things have outside the sphere of religion. To understand Jesus' saying that "not as the world gives I give unto you," we must also know the sense in which the world gives. Religion isolated into the formalities of ritual will be empty estheticism, literally a game one plays, but no more. While Phillips continues to claim that we cannot assess religious reactions to worldly situations according to criteria extrinsic to religion, he also insists that such reactions should not be "fantastic" in the sense of contradicting, distorting, or ignoring "what we already know" (1993, p. 70). For example, if some religious persons say that all suffering has some purpose, it is legitimate to accuse them of not taking suffering seriously. Furthermore, it is the connection between religious belief and our wordly situations which makes religious belief a matter of "striving" to believe. The tension between our beliefs and our desires such as pride, envy, and lust makes believing a matter of genuine struggle. Similarly, the existence of evil and tragedy in the world puts our faith in God on trial, not because it tests what is essentially a theory or a hypothesis but because it renders useless a certain picture of the situation and makes it impossible to react in a certain way. The meaning and force of religious beliefs, then, do depend, in part, on their relation to worldly situations. For Phillips, however, these objections to the idea of religious belief as a distinctive language game still remain "confused." They are drawing false conclusions from impor tant truths. The fact of partial dependence of the meaning and force of religious beliefs on non-religious situations does not deny that religious beliefs are distinctive language games. Religious beliefs still have their own intrinsic criteria; they do not derive their justification or conclusion from the non-religious facts they depend on. For example, if a boxer crosses himself before a match in the thought that it will protect him from harm, this contradicts what we already know about causality, and his crossing himself will be a blunder based on ^ Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 137 ignorance of causal relations. He will also be treating his religious belief as a testable hypoth esis. On the other hand, he may be dedicating his performance in the hope that it will be worthy of what he believes in, in which case his crossing himself has the different significance of expressing his faith and trust. It is in ignoring this religious character of the performance that the attempt to dismiss it as superstition remains confused. The faith and trust expressed in the crossing of oneself is something absolute and cannot be justified in any external way (1993, pp. 56-77). What, then, is the grammar of God, the concept of God operative in its proper context of faith practices? What does the religious context say about what is appropriate and what is not about God? Does "God" refer to anything beyond this world? Again, Phillips's answer is that what is important is not whether God does or does not refer to a transcendent reality but what it means to say such a thing or what such a statement "amounts to." For this, we have to look to religious language. Here, depending on Rush Rhees's example, Phillips argues that we have to pay attention to the basic difference in grammar when we are referring to God and other objects in the world. We can know, for example, who Winston Churchill is without knowing that he was prime minister, but not also without knowing that he had a face, hands, voice, etc. Being a prime minister is not essential to being Churchill, but having the characteristics of a body is. On the other hand, we cannot know who God is unless we also know God as the loving creator of all things and the source of grace. These attributes are essential to God in the sense of defining the very concept of God or the kind of reality that God is, and constitute "grammatical" attributes, as bodily characteristics constitute grammatical attributes for human beings. Any notion of God as essentially an object of fear and hope from whom one expects reward and punishment as from another human being is a purely instru mentalist and consequentialist notion that reduces God to an object of my fear and hope, and violates the grammar of God, who is God only as an absolute reality to be worshiped for her own sake (2007). Any notion of divine omnipotence conceived as another moral agent like us or conceived as simply the power to do whatever is not logically contradictory violates the grammar of God. To use Phillips's favorite examples, God cannot ride a bicycle, lick a Haagen-Dazs ice cream (his favorite!), bump his head, have sexual intercourse, or learn a language, all of which are appropriate to bodily beings but hardly appropriate to the spiritual creator of all things (2005, p. 12). It is precisely in this religious context that we can also meaningfully talk about the tran scendent, objective reality of God. Against the many charges brought against his views, especially that of linguistic idealism that seems to reduce the objective reality of things to the reality of words, Phillips insists that it is the practice of faith and worship that itself stresses the irreducible reality of God by distinguishes between the objective reality of God and our own mental act of faith and denounces the vice of idolatry by distinguishing the nothingness of the creature and the transcendence of the creator. Believers are answerable to God, not to their words about God. It is true that it takes participation in the religious form of life to appreciate the meaning of God as creator, for God can be confessed and worshiped only as the creator of all things. Confession, however, is not about our language about God but about God herself. We do refer to God indeed, but we can do so without violating the grammar of God only in the context of faith and confession. God is indeed independent and transcendent but can be truly so acknowledged only on condition of faith. The existence of a thing is not reducible to the mental activity of speaking about it, but what that existence means or amounts to can be understood only in the way we talk about that (2005, pp. 168-191). Finally, then, does Phillips allow for the inexpressibility of God in religious language? For him, this too is an example of confusion. Religious language is precisely that proper medium in which alone it makes sense to speak of the mystery of God. To argue that the ^ Springer</page><page sequence="8">138 Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 mystery of God cannot be expressed in religious language is in effect to place the mystery of God outside its only proper context and thereby make divine mystery as divine mystery impossible. Furthermore, it is absurd to speak of God's unknowability; in the religious con text God is known as mysterious. When we say that "words cannot tell you how grateful I am," says Phillips, we are not expressing our failure to thank due to the limitations of our language; it is precisely the form and way we express our gratitude. When we confess to God that "you are beyond mortal telling," we are not expressing our failure to worship but precisely the way we worship. Just as it is within the religious language that we can refer to God's objective and transcendent reality, so it is within that same language that we witness to God's inexpressible reality. The religious language, for Phillips, is itself only a medium of expression, and it is confusion to blame language itself for its failure or success to do any particular thing (2007). There is a large core of truth and plausibility about Phillips's contextualist understanding of religious language. The sense or meaning of a word or concept is not autonomous but con textual. This context is constituted by our practices and forms of life, each of which in turn generates a world view, language game, grammar, and logic internal to itself. The religious concepts of God, grace, omnipotence, and others are not exceptions to this contextual condi tion for all meaning and sense. It is, therefore, absurd to think that Phillips's contextualism is motivated by a desire to so isolate religion as to make it immune to all criticism. He is only applying to religion what are the a priori conditions for the possibility of any genuine sense and meaning. Moreover, ever since Hegel, Marx, Durkheim, phenomenology, and structuralism, some sort of contextualism has been generally accepted by most Western intellectuals. The meaning or sense of a thing depends on its place in the whole to which it belongs, whether this whole is political, economic, or cultural. This contextualism, one can say, is the completion of the logic of Western modernity. Ever since Descartes, modernity has put the issue of meaning in terms of subjectivity and objectivity, always subordinating the objectivity of things to some form or other of human subjectivity, to the thinking subjectivity of the isolated ego, or his sensing subjectivity, or the formal a priori structure of the collective subject, or the idealist dialectic of the human spirit, or the materialist praxis of collective subjectivity, or our social construction of reality. In an important sense, the Wittgensteinian subjection of meaning and sense to human forms of life and practice is one of the latest forms of the typically modern Western subordination of objectivity to the human subject. In reflecting on Phillips's position let me begin by pointing out certain inherent ambigu ities. The basic outlines of his theory of language games and forms of life are reasonably clear, and it is easy enough to follow what he is saying. What is not clear, largely because he does not really provide an extended analysis of his theory anywhere, contenting himself with giving ad hoc examples and appealing to certain intuitive plausibilities, is the scope of the practices and forms of life which are meant to provide the conditions of meaning for religious beliefs such as the concept of God and various divine attributes. Can we say, for example, that Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Luther, and the present Archbishop of Canterbury share the same form of life since they all seem to share a certain conception of God as an absolute reality, eternal, omnipotent, and loving? Should we say that Lutherans share the same form of life because they share the same understanding of justification by faith? Are we going to say that wherever we find a shared conception of some basic propositions and world views, there is a shared form of life? Where does a form of life begin and end? Do all Christians share the same form of life regardless of their historical, denominational, and dogmatic differences? Or, shall we say that forms of life overlap with one another in the most complicating ways that it is not really possible to separate one form of life from others? For example, shall we ? Springer</page><page sequence="9">Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 139 say that a Christian today shares one form of life with all other Christians, another form of life with all members of her denomination, a third form of life with all members of her generation, a fourth form of life with her fellow citizens, Christian or otherwise, and so on, so that in one and the same person many forms of life are interacting? This ambiguity leads to my first important point. Even though the idea of forms of life and practices is reasonably clear in Phillips's works, and even though he is fully aware that they are interacting and changing, he does give the impression on the whole that these forms of life and practices are relatively fixed and isolated. I think it is imperative to develop his ideas further by introducing movement, heterogeneity, and interaction into his forms of life and practices so as to bring his ideas closer to the objective reality of such forms and practices. Forms of life and practices vary in scope from the relatively simple cases of playing chess and adding numbers to academic practices of taking courses, grading, degree requirements, and importance of degrees to business practices in the many areas of banking, heavy industry, electronics, and investing to cultural practices of going to movies, concerts, and museums to religious practices of worship, prayer, meditation, and religious education. What complicates the picture is that all these practices can be further divided under different cultural settings (Confucian, Islamic, Hindu, Christian, African, etc.). Forms of life and practices not only vary in scope; they are also products of historical changes. The "Davos culture," the culture of the international business elite, and the "Faculty Club International," the internationaliza tion of Western intelligentsia, are obviously products of contemporary globalization (Berger 1997). Not only are forms of life variant in scope or products of history; these variations in scope and historical genesis are themselves results of complex interactions with other forms of life and practices, interactions which increasingly become internal to the affected forms, promoting, eroding, and in any case significantly changing their identity, which is no longer identical but internally heterogeneous. The point of this dialectical reflection on forms of life and practices is that the grammar or concept of God that Phillips so insists on is itself a product of a long history of human consciousness and subject to all the dialectic of interaction with competing forms of life and their world views in the contemporary world. The idea of God as an absolute, eternal, and infinite reality radically different from things in this world is an idea that has taken thousands of years to mature and take root in a particular group of people, and is now being exposed to the totalizing, often trivializing, and always commercializing impact of the internet with all its conflicting ideologies, values, and conceptions of the good life. The forms of life that promote the absolute understanding and grammar of God are being changed, eroded, and in any case severely challenged by the forces of globalization that leave no form of life and practice untouched and therefore no grammar unaffected. It is not only that, as Phillips knew, the "world" puts our faith on trial or partially determines the meaning and sense of religious belief; the world can put faith to a more radical challenge, trivializing it into non-existence by making absolute commitments increasingly impossible, or relativizing it into non-sig nificance by exposing it to the competition among rival forms of ultimate belief systems, or confusing it in any case by compelling it to make sense of the trivializing, relativizing, and pluralizing tendencies of globalization. Forms of life and their world views are far more dialectically complicated than Phillips seems to realize. There is another point to this dialectical reflection. I think it is important to see a matching relation between the scope of the form of life and the scope of the belief in question. If, for example, the belief whose meaning is at issue is a belief about where to park your car on campus, the appropriate context or form of life to look for as the condition of its meaning will be the common practical life of the particular school. If the belief at issue is about where to go to graduate school in America, the appropriate context will be the set of academic ? Springer</page><page sequence="10">140 Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 practices governing graduate education in contemporary America. If the belief at issue is a belief about the stock market, the appropriate context or form of life will be the business practices of the Wall Street. These examples should make it clear that it is necessary to look for a form and context of life appropriate to the kind and scope of the belief in question. This, however, also raises a complicating question with regard to religious beliefs. The more external and practical a belief is, the easier it becomes to identify its appropriate context of meaning, a certain historically determinate form of life and practices. Where to move a king or a queen in a chess game, for example, simply depends on the rules of the game. When the question at issue touches the existential and religious domain, however, it is not so easy to locate and point to the appropriate context. The question of the meaning of death, for example, is not only a historical question concerning its meaning for a particular society and religion but also an existential question concerning its meaning for all human beings regardless of their particular historical setting. Guilt about one's moral failure, love as a per manent human need, hope for something enduring, death as a definitive end of human life: these are not only historically specific in the responses elicited but also humanly universal in the challenges they provoke. It is quite reasonable to look for historically specific responses in their institutionalized form as the context of the meaning of these beliefs; it is equally rea sonable to also look for certain universal or common patterns among the historically variant contexts of responses insofar as those phenomena are universally human. Human beings are indeed historically different, but they are not so different as to be only different with nothing in common. Regarding the grammar of God this raises the important question: Does Phillips's view allow for both historical specificity and existential universality? He insists that the grammar of God is that of an absolute eternal being and creator of all things. How does he know this? Because the form of life that makes "God" meaningful is the life of faith and worship, and this life says that God is such an absolute reality. It is clear that this concept of God is deriv ative from the Judeo-Christian tradition. This concept does not mean that it is relevant only to the situation of worship separated from all other spheres of life. In fact, we saw Phillips insisting that the grammar of God makes God relevant to all fields of human concern and activity because we are asked to practice God's creative love in all human situations. What about God's relevance to all human beings, not just to all human situations? If the grammar of God is that of the loving creator of all things including all humanity, does Phillips ever argue for this universal human relevance? Should we not look by the very logic or grammar of God as the loving creator of all human beings for some traces of faith and yearning for God in all humanity and in the various religions in which human beings concretizes their relationship to God? It would seem that the grammar of God requires not only that God is not a means relative to some particular human purpose, like greed and ambition, not only that God is relevant to all human situations, but also that God loves all human beings as her creatures, and that if so, all human groups must also show some religious expressions of faith and worship appropriate to the meaning of God. The idea of a God relevant only to some nations and cultures will be just as ungrammatical as is the idea of a God who doles out arbitrary destinies for different human beings. Will Phillips allow this, which means that the context of the grammar of God is constituted not by a single form of life of a particular religious tradition but in some way by a plurality of often conflicting forms of life belonging to many different religious traditions? The logic or grammar of God raises another issue. It raises not only the question of God's relevance to all human situations in the consciousness of the religious believer, not only the question of God's relevance to all human beings in their religious consciousness, but also the question of God's relevance to all human beings in all their mundane situations regardless of ? Springer</page><page sequence="11">Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 141 how explicitly conscious of God they may be in such situations. That is to say, is it possible to regard all human situations of all human beings as the form of life or practical context for the belief in God? If the grammar of God requires making the belief in God relevant to all situations, and if the same grammar requires making the same belief relevant to all human beings, can't we go one step further and say that we have to regard all forms of life and practices as the appropriate context for the belief in God? Doesn't the idea of God as creator of all things entail God's lordship over all things and therefore over all situations? Can there be any realm of human groups and activities to which God may be irrelevant? Some human beings like Italian spaghetti, others like Chinese noo dles. One can say that these are simply matters of contingent tastes. Will the grammar of God allow us to say that God is relevant only to those who like to believe in God, in much the same way that Chinese noodles and Italian spaghetti are only relevant to those who happen to like it? Different things become relevant to different people according to their specific context of existence according to nationality, gender, profession, status, ethnicity, etc. The Stars and Stripes are relevant to American people and those who study national flags. Techniques of car repair are relevant to car drivers and car mechanics. Is God, then, one of the things which people may or may not find relevant according to their varying, contingent contextual needs? If the grammar of God does not allow limiting the relevance of God to a contingent situation, isn't there a sense, a very important sense indeed, in which we can say that the grammar of God as an "absolute" reality makes God relevant to all contexts and all forms of life? It seems that we should not only allow a particular context?faith and worship of a particular community?to provide the proper concept or meaning or grammar of God; we should also follow the logic of this grammar in its absolutenss and universality and allow that logic to determine the kind of contexts to which it should be relevant, that is, to be relevant to all contexts and all forms of life insofar as these are creatures internally related to their creator. In an important sense we can say that just as God is not one object among other objects, God's relevance is not limited to one context among other contexts either; the one is as much confused as the other. The true grammar of God seems to demand nothing less. This raises another important issue. Most people including most Christians are not always conscious of the presence of God in their worldly situations, which remains "secular" as opposed to their "sacred" moments in specifically religious situations where they are con scious of the presence of God. It is precisely to meet this situation where we are not always conscious of the divine, although perhaps we should be, given the omnipresence of God in all created things, that Tillich and Rahner came up respectively with the notion of the "depth" dimension of the human spirit and the "horizon" of all human existence and knowledge. For Tillich, religion is not one special function among others of the human spirit but "the dimen sion of depth in all of them, ... [that] points to that which is ultimate, infinite, unconditional in man's spiritual life" (1964, p. 7). For Rahner, God is present in all things we do as the ultimate "horizon" whose reality we implicitly affirm in every act of judging and doing as its a priori condition by virtue of an anticipatory grasp or Vorgriff (1969, pp. 53-68). For both Tillich and Rahner, God is not a being whom we can meet only in a particular form of life or language game, although we do become "explicitly" conscious of God in specifically religious activities. We meet God in every situation and every context as the absolute ines capable horizon of our existence in its totality, although only "implicitly" or "latently." This is only possible because God is not an object among objects but the ground and horizon of all being and knowledge. For both this is a consclusion of a long but insightful metaphysical analysis of the structure and dynamics of human existence. But perhaps this is precisely what Phillips does not like, metaphysics. ? Springer</page><page sequence="12">142 Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 My second point of reflection, then, has to do with the role of intellectual, metaphysical reflection in the settling of the meaning of religious beliefs. In Phillips I detect an empiricist tendency to directly attribute our beliefs to our practices as given in the life of a community, an existentialist tendency to equate the objective meaning of a belief with its actualization in the qualitative transformation of a person's existence a la Kierkegaard, and an anti-intellec tual tendency to dismiss metaphysical analyses as useless abstractions. All these tendencies excessively belittle the role and power of the human intellect in human life. It is true that we acquire our religious beliefs by participating in the practices of a believing community, but this does not mean that there is no room for our own intellectual judgments in the process of appropriation. No matter how long and how intensely we may participate, there comes a moment when our own intellect has to give its own assent to the truth and reasonable ness of the practices and articles of faith we participate in. Our appropriation is never totally blind but requires varying degrees of participation on the part of our own intellect. Phillips's empiricism seems to deny this. What is most important to note, however, is that the Christian Church itself from its earliest beginnings has always incorporated metaphysical analysis into its noetic structure, as witness all the great theologians. Metaphysics was an intrinsic part of theology as such. Phillips might say that this is acceptable as long as theologians do this in the context and light of their faith seeking understanding, as Anselm did. Philips, therefore, might accept metaphysical analysis within the context of faith, just as Barth exempts Anselm from the strictures against natural theology on the ground that Anselm was carrying on his reflection within faith. This is all very well. Furthermore, Phillips himself engages in metaphysical analysis, as witness his appeal to the ideas of creator, creation, creatureliness, contingency, giftedness of existence, the radical difference of reality between God and creatures, and other theological concepts that are also thoroughly metaphysical. Grammatical differences are in fact differences in the kind of real ity things have and therefore metaphysical differences. Granted, for the sake of argument, that we cannot do metaphysics outside all contexts. Why not then do more metaphysics and do it more systematically and thoroughly within the context of Christian faith? Phillips argues like a good metaphysician that God is a different kind of reality than an object among other objects, but then refuses to engage in a further, systematic analysis of the being of created and uncreated entities precisely to show the metaphysical basis for the difference in reality and therefore also in grammar between God and creatures. Likewise, he argues that the point of the doctrine of grace and predestination is to show the basic crea tureliness of all human beings and the need to care for fellow creatures as an expression of gratitude to God, but then refuses to go further by providing a metaphysical analysis of what it means to create, what the creator must be in order to be able to create, how this creating is not comparable to the making of things at the level of created things of our experience, and how human freedom and divine grace are not mutually exclusive in the way that two human freedoms might be. I do not know of any place where Phillips provides a lengthy systematic analysis of these profoundly metaphysical issues. He usually contents himself with an appeal to some telling examples and intuitive plausibilities followed by some gen eral remarks based on such intuitions. He leaves so many issues simply dangling, issues a traditional metaphysician would grab and explore with enthusiasm and gusto. My third and final point of reflection has to do with the irreducible difference between human subjectivity in all its forms and the objectivity of reality whether created or divine. I earlier noted certain modern and postmodern Western desire to measure and evaluate reality by the criteria of human subjectivity in its many forms, individual and collective, theoretical and practical, saying that the Wittgensteinian appeal to language games and forms of life as the context of meaning and evaluation is only one of the most recent attempts in the same ? Springer</page><page sequence="13">Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 143 anthropocentric direction. My assertion of the irreducible difference between subjectivity and objectivity or between human thought and objective reality should be taken in a postcritical sense. No modern intellectual today would be a na?ve realist. Reality is indeed mediated, theoretically interpreted and practically transformed, by human beings in light of their world views and horizons. This fact, however, should not lead us to the anthropocentric illusion that there is nothing outside the text, or language games, or stories, or horizons, or ideologies. Being creatures means that we have not created the conditions of our own existence; these conditions are given there prior to our initiative, and all our initiatives, theoretical or practical, must conform to these conditions. It means that we should not absolutize ourselves, individually or collectively, not only in the sense that we should care for others as fellow creatures, as Phillips rightly remarked, but also that we should not try to dominate reality by subordinating it to the criteria and perspectives of our own horizons and language games. Despite all the inevitable mediation by our own subjectivity, reality remains both other and more than what it means to the human subject(s). We can begin with something elementary. There is a world of difference between the idea of a thing and the reality of the thing of which the idea is an idea. Without in any way denying the isomorphism of being and thought so foundational to the classical tradition, it is also clear that the subjective idea is not identical with the objective thing. My idea of war is not the same as the reality of war. It is not only that my idea of war does not bleed, but that the reality of war is bloody. It is also that my idea of war does not reflect the reality of war in all its complexity and dialectic. This is something we can easily generalize to the level of our collective ideas, ideologies, language games, perspectives, and horizons. Without denying that some ideas might be more adequate than others, our collective ideas are not identical with the objective reality of the things and situations of which we have ideas. We like to assume a simple identity between our ideas and the objective reality of the world. We think and claim that the world is what we think it is. We entertain the illusion that our ideas are themselves the realities of the world, reducing the world to our subjectivity. Through vari ous experiences, empirical researches, but most dramatically disasters natural or social, we learn that our ideas were wrong, often shocked and disillusioned into the recognition of the persisting difference and contradiction between our thoughts and the world we think about. It took the shock of World War I for Barth and Neo-Orthodoxy to shake off the illusions of liberal Protestant theology. It took the shock of the Depression to shake both capitalists and socialists from their social complacency and illusions. It took the shock of Hurricane Hugo of 1990 to shake me from all my anthropocentric illusions about the world. Changes in the real world have a way of replacing and displacing philosophical systems. Things are not what we think they are. Kierkegaard spoke the truth: the identity of thought and being applies only to divine creative thought, not to the human created thought, which does remain ever vulnerable to the shock of reality (Min 2004, pp. 79-82). We try to hang on to the modern Western myth of constitutive subjectivity through pure formalism. The Enlightenment rationalists used to claim that the world is what reason thinks it is; to say that it is not is itself a judgment of reason and therefore valid only for reason, thought, or concept. It seems we cannot escape the reign of reason. Contemporary contextu alism comes along and repeats the claims of modern constitutive consciousness: the negation of context, the distinction between context and reality, and the transcendence of context are themselves possible only within a context. Even in its self-negation and self-transcendence context remains constitutive: we cannot stand outside of all contexts or language games. This, however, is an empty claim, purely formal without content. When the complacent middle class American boys came home from Vietnam in plastic bags and on crutches, with their world view shattered and their illusions exposed, what comfort would it be to say that the ? Springer</page><page sequence="14">144 Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 experience of the shattering is still possible only for their constitutive subjective conscious ness, that it makes sense only in a worldview and a language game, when the constitutive role of such collective subjectivity is precisely to be shattered and to negate and transcend itself, like the last hurrah of a defeated general about to surrender himself? Wouldn't it be more reasonable to recognize up front that we can "constitute" the world only because we are, as creatures, first constituted to do so and learn to relativize ourselves? This has more than a little bearing on our present problematic. Phillips tries to place God in the religious context where God can be recognized as an absolute reality. This is done in two different ways which can perhaps be misinterpreted. In one way he does this by saying that to know God is to worship God, that to worship God is to change our ways in light of God. To know that God is love is to practice love for one another. This is an existentialist, Kierkegaardian approach. The claim is that there is an internal relation between belief and practice: belief by its nature is meant to lead to the transformation of our existence. We have to be careful here, however. We should not equate the perfectly necessary ethical exhorta tion to subjective transformation with a statement of the objective reality of the object of belief. To say that there is an internal relation between belief and practice is still to maintain a distinction between the two; if not distinct, how can they be related, even internally? By the nature of the content, however, the belief demands to be actualized by each subject who believes. However, we should not forget that there is also the objective side of that reality, which should not be equated with and reduced to its role in the transformation of subjective existence. To say God is love indeed demands that we practice that love, but the reason why it does is precisely because it is God, not another human being, who is love, that is, because God is a certain reality even apart from her role in transforming our human existence. The internal demand to actualize love in our human life is itself parasitic on the antecedent objective reality of God as creator, infinite, eternal, etc. It is important, then, to realize that in our haste to emphasize the ethical imperative of trans forming our subjectivity, we do not forget the transcendent reality of God over us, beyond us, and apart from us, and do not reduce the meaning of "God is love" to what it entails by way of our subjective transformation. Even if we are not transformed, it does remain true that God is love. Even if we are sinners indifferent to divine grace, God remains a graceful God. Even if Christians are all hypocrites, Christianity can remain true. We should not confuse the objec tive sovereign reality of God with the ethical imperative of subjective transformation. The difference between objectivity and subjectivity, especially between divine objectivity and human subjectivity, remains implicit precisely in the ethical imperative of subjective trans formation which is imperative only because it comes from a sovereign God who is more, far more, infinitely more, semper magis, than what we are or what God means to our subjectivity. The classical distinction between immanent Trinity and economic Trinity, between what God is in herself and what God is for us, is a distinction that must be maintained for the sake of both the infinity of God and the finitude of humanity. The other way of recognizing the absolute reality of God in the context of religious faith is to show that it is the believing consciousness itself that makes a distinction between God and idol, between the irreducible sovereignty of God and human lowliness. As I already mentioned earlier, however, this is still to maintain the priority of constitutive human con sciousness in relation to the sovereignty of God: God is sovereign because believers can themselves humble and negate themselves. This is not dissimilar to the postmodern phenom enological approach of Levinas, Derrida, and Marion, all of whom treat the transcendence of God as a function of human subjectivity in its self-negation and ironically reduces and relativizes God to human subjectivity (Min 2006). ? Springer</page><page sequence="15">Int J Philos Relig (2008) 63:131-146 145 The question of whether Phillips's Wittgensteinian approach is reductionist or not comes to the fore once again in the treatment of religious language in its ability to express the inexpressible God. Phillips is quite content with the statement that God is known in religious language as mystery, and that the confession to God that "you are beyond mortal telling" is itself the way, not a failure, to worship God, as the statement that "words are not adequate to express my gratitude to you" is itself the way, not a failure, to express gratitude. There are three points to be made here. One is that Phillips only says that the proper context of mystery is precisely the religious context of faith and worship, which is an important insight, but he fails to go on, for fear of metaphysics, to provide an analysis of what mystery might be as divine mystery. A distinction like the distinction St. Thomas makes between our ability to know God through her created effects and our inability to know God in her own essence would have been very helpful in the further analysis and development of the concept, as would have been Rahner's profound essay on the Catholic concept of mystery (McCool pp. 108-119). Secondly, it is worth noting the paradox in Phillips's remark on the two statements that the self-negation of language is itself a positive way of worshipping God, not an expression of failure to do so. I am afraid here that he is not sensitive enough to the tension involved in that self-negation. We cannot avoid using human language to worship God, but human language can do its worshipping function only by negating itself. There is no avoiding a tension between the form of language and the content that negates and transcends and breaks through that form. It would be a travesty of true worship if the worshipper was quite content and happy because she just did the best she could with the human language, the only language at her disposal, without any sense of regret and sorrow that her language is not even remotely adequate to express God in her splendor and glory. Between her regret and her performance there is an ongoing tension between the form she cannot avoid using in order to worship God and the divine content that overlows and breaks through the form. Here is the tension and paradox. Religious language does its job only by acknowledging a sovereign reality that transcends it, only by negating and transcending itself in the direction of something indeed totally other. Finally, why is human language radically inadequate? Phillips seems to deny that human language can be inadequate. In fact, he would consider it a matter of confusion to predi cate adequacy or inadequacy of human language. Language as such is neither adequate nor inadequate. Here he seems to ignore the many philosophical reflections on the nature of human language, on how human language is suited to express the subject/object relations in the material world (Aquinas), "representational" thinking (Heidegger), and "predicative language" (Marion), which, left to itself, would necessarily lead to ontotheology that reduces God to an object among objects, an idol, unless one consciously uses language in an analog ical way (Min 2005, pp. 168-174; 2006, 2007). It is unfortunate that someone like Phillips, who spends so much time talking about language, spends so little reflection on the structural inadequacies of language as such when it refers to transmundane realities.3 Acknowledgements I came to Claremont in the same year ( 1992) that D. Z. Phillips did and had the pleasure and honor of being his colleague for 14 years. He was one of the most truly remarkable philosophers, col leagues, and above all human beings I had ever known, and for all my serious philosophical differences with him I will always count his friendship as one of God's greatest gifts. I thank Eugene Long for his invitation to contribute to this commemorative volume. I dedicate this essay to the memory of D. Z. Phillips, a truly great human being. Requiescat in pace. 3 One of the most sensible critics of Phillips's philosophy of religion, I think, is Patrick Sherry (1972), who pointed out the need to "locate," "relate," and "justify" language games.
