Hill1 Those communities that lived in Britain and Ireland ca. 800 B.C. to A.D. 100 represent particularly well-researched examples of the complex agrarian, nonurban, societies with high population densities that characterize the Pre-Roman Iron Age across temperate Europe. This paper provides a critical introduction to the extensive recent literature on the Pre-Roman Iron Age in Britain and Ireland. Evidence from the large number of salvage excavations and surveys, the application of a wide range of analytical techniques, and important changes in interpretative frameworks are transforming understandings of this period. After reviewing these developments, a chronological account of the period is outlined which attempts to integrate these new results. This suggests that current interpretations of social processes across Iron Age Europe in terms of state formation, urbanization, and core-periphery relations with Mediterranean civilization need revision. KEY WORDS: Iron Age; British Isles; social reproduction; regional diversity; ritual. INTRODUCTION This paper provides an overview of the Pre-Roman Iron Age (PRIA) in the area known today as the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ire land. This is the period between the end of the Bronze Age in temperate Europe and the Roman conquest of most of mainland Britain between A.D. 43 and A.D. 84. The period is normally divided into three phases; Early, Middle, and Late (abbreviated here EPRIA, MPRIA, and LPRIA, respec tively) (Fig. 1). I outline the main characteristics and developments of this era, introducing the reader to the results of recent research and changing Churchill College, The University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 ODN, United Kingdom. 47 0892-7537/95/0300-0047507.50/0 ? 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">48 Hill Calender Years 100 AD 50 AD 0 50 BC 100 BC 200 BC 300 BC 400 BC 500 BC 600 BC 700 BC 800 BC 900 BC Fig. 1.

Above all, I hope that this summary will illus trate the great potential offered by an almost unparalleled density, in both time and space, of high-quality data available for the study of the Pre-Ro man Iron Age in Britain. This is material which can be used to address a wide range of questions about European later prehistory in particular and the understanding of complex, agrarian societies in general. The British Isles comprise a collection of two large and many smaller islands off the north coast of the European land mass (Fig. 2). Perceptions of this geographical reality have strongly shaped interpretations of the PRIA. Both the English Channel/North Sea and the Irish Sea have been assumed to have been major boundaries in Later Prehistory, so that the British mainland has been considered as a unity distinct from Continental Europe and from Ireland. As such the British Iron Age is often considered in isolation and assumed to be different from that of western mainland Europe. The apparent peripheral location of the British Isles on the edge of "mainstream" developments in Central Europe and/or the Mediterra nean has strongly shaped chronologies and social interpretations. Innova tions are held to have come from the south, only slowly filtering north and west (Hingley, 1995). This results in a southeast versus northwest divide, strengthened by perceptions of the physical and political geography of Brit ain. The east and south are lowlying and drier than the more upland and wetter west and north (Fig. 2). The east and south have also been the most populous and politically dominant parts of Britain in recent centuries. To what extent Iron Age communities in west and north Britain and Ireland were in reality more backward or less complex compared to those in the southeast needs reassessment (Hingley, 1995; Jones, 1995). General accounts of the period are given by Raftery (1994) for Ireland and Cunliffe (1974, 1991) for mainland Britain. To these should be added a collection of new reviews and studies (Champion and Collis, 1995), a review of the later PRIA (Haselgrove, 1989), a national review for Scotland (Hingley, 1993), and several regional summaries (e.g., Knight, 1984; Hard ing, 1982; Lambrick, 1992; Quinnell, 1986; Williams, 1988). However, only two regions are extensively covered by syntheses and regional analyses. These are western and northern Scotland (e.g., Armit, 1989, 1992; Foster, 1989b; Hedges, 1987; Hingley, 1993, 1995) and southern central England Wessex and the upper Thames Valley (e.g., Cunliffe and Miles, 1984; Fitzpatrick and Morris, 1994; Lambrick, 1992). The growing published re sults of fieldwork and research are regularly abstracted in the British Ar chaeological Bibliography. For the place of the PRIA within British Prehistoric and Roman archaeology, see Bradley (1991, 1984), Darvill (1987), Haselgrove (1989), Herity and Eogan (1977), Millett (1990a), and O'Kelly (1989).</page><page sequence="4">50 Hill " ~&lt;&amp; Vt* Shetland ^-^1 /^Vn^-r^-rs-r-*^ Orkney Hebrides \ly 4/ | Scottish f ^ j Highlands Atlantic Ocean x?5f ^_f^~S North Sea ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^ EaSt v^-2!r V \ IrisJlS?I &gt; East Yorkshire ^ The Midlands ^^^Eas^^| ___^"^f Thames Valley ^_ 7 South West England Wessex Land over 200m English Channel Fig. 2.

I first outline a history of British Iron Age studies to familiarize the reader with the main approaches over the last 60 years, which have produced the picture of the Iron Age we now have. I then sketch the main features of the settlement, economy, ritual, and social organization, recognizing that this will inevitably be a caricature and mask the great variety through time and space. Finally, I offer a chronological overview and interpretation of the main changes that oc curred during these final eight centuries of British Prehistory. To reduce the length of the bibliography, specific references for indi vidual excavations and surveys have been omitted. The location of key sites discussed below is given in Fig. 11, but for every specific site named, the county (unit of local administration) is given to help readers approximately locate the site if they have access to a good atlas map of the British Isles. Finally, readers should note, for reasons discussed below, that radiocarbon based chronologies are not extensively used in British and Irish PRIA stud ies. All dates in this article are absolute dates derived from a mixture of both calibrated radiocarbon and historical dates, unless otherwise stated. THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRON AGE STUDIES In common with British archaeology in general, there has been little concern with either documenting or analyzing the history of Iron Age stud ies [see Avery (1976), Cunliffe (1991), and Collis (1994) for basic outlines; see Mulvaney (1962) and Evans (1989a) for examples of detailed critical studies]. Paradoxically, Iron Age studies had their beginnings both before and after the adoption of the Three Age System in the midnineteenth century. The study of those peoples living in Britain before the Roman conquest and described by Classical authors represents a vibrant scholarly tradition stretching back to the fifteenth century. Notions about these "Celtic" peo ples formed during the Romantic and Nationalist eras still play a strong role in shaping both popular and academic perceptions of the Iron Age (e.g., Champion, 1987, Chapman, 1992; Hill, 1989). However, it can be ar gued that a coherent "Iron Age archaeology" emerged only in the 1920s and 1930s. These decades saw an explosion of excavations and the estab lishment of chronological and explanatory frameworks, along with the nec essary disciplinary framework. Key excavations in Wessex provided the type sites and research agenda that were then extended to the whole of main land Britain. A basic three-stage pottery chronology was proposed for southeast Britain, each corresponding to a new "culture" brought by con</page><page sequence="6">52 Hill tinental migrants. This ABC culture history and integral chronology were increasingly refined over the next 30 years. This culture historical approach was largely rejected in the 1960s and 1970s, essentially with the rejection of the invasion hypothesis to explain cultural change. Its rejection in the United Kingdom corresponded to re duced concern with identifying the arrival of Celtic peoples and/or lan guage. However, this has remained a central question in Irish prehistory (e.g., Raftery, 1994; papers in Emania, 1991). New explanatory frameworks in the United Kingdom stressed internal social evolution and were particu larly influenced by contemporary developments within geography (e.g., Cunliffe, 1974; Clarke, 1972; Grant, 1986). Throughout the 1970s and later, Barry Cunliffe has held the pivotal role in PRIA studies. His early work led to the first synthesis of the new view of the period (1974). Cunliffe's major research excavations in Wessex, especially at Danebury, Hampshire (1984), provided the spur for important scientific analyses (e.g., Jones, 1984) and still essentially set the research agenda for others to follow or react against. The 1980s continued many existing trends, but with an explanatory shift away from simple internal social evolutionary models to consideration of the impacts of external contacts. Core and periphery models became particularly important for explaining change and exploring the impact of the spreading Roman empire (e.g., Haselgrove, 1982; Cunliffe, 1988). How ever, the greatest development has been the explosion in rescue (salvage) excavations and surveys across the United Kingdom and Ireland. Its full consequences have yet to be felt, but where there have been concentrations of rescue archaeology it is providing a fuller understanding of Iron Age communities in the foci of both traditional research, such as Wessex, and others. The often sizable finds assemblages from such excavations have led to important work on craft production and distribution, drawing on a range of analytical techniques (e.g., Ehrenreich, 1985; Heslop, 1988; Morris, 1994c; Northover, 1994; Scott, 1991). Increasingly subtle and sophisticated studies of botanical and animal remains are revealing both the complex nature of Iron Age farming practices and the taphonomic processes that worked to produce the archaeological record (Allen and Robinson, 1993; Grant, 1984; Jones, 1995; Maltby, 1985, 1994; van der Veen, 1992; Wilson, 1985). The study of coinage has witnessed a massive increase in the number of finds and types through the discoveries of metal detector users (Van Arsdall, 1989; Haselgrove, 1993; Mays, 1992). However, with notable exceptions (Hasel grove, 1987; 1988; Fitzpatrick, 1992b; Sellwood, 1984), numismatics is es sentially an autonomous and separate branch of Iron Age studies. A similar separation marks the study of Iron Age/"Celtic" "Art" (i.e., decorated metal</page><page sequence="7">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 53 work) (Megaw and Megaw, 1989; Stead, 1984, 1985). These, and the con siderable body of studies of "Celtic" Religion/"Myth" (e.g., Green, 1986, 1992), are seen by some as somewhat divorced from archaeological studies of settlement and society (Fitzpatrick, 1991; Taylor, 1991). Since the late 1980s a number of scholars have challenged the explana tory frameworks of Iron Age studies (e.g., Bowden and McOmish, 1987; Fitzpatrick, 1991; Foster, 1989a; Hingley, 1984, 1990b; Hill, 1989 1995a,b; Parker-Pearson, 1995; Sharpies, 1991b; Woolf, 1993a-c). Drawing on de velopments in archaeological theory, work in Neolithic archaeology, and detailed studies of archaeological material, they have argued that the pe riod was different from what has previously been assumed (Hill, 1989, 1993; Parker-Pearson, 1995; Parker-Pearson and Richards 1993). An important focus of this new work has been on the formation of the archaeological record and the spatial organization of settlements. Confirming previous suggestions (Grant, 1984; Wait, 1985; Cunliffe, 1992), such studies have ar gued that the bulk of material deposited on Iron Age settlements can be considered as "structured deposition" resulting not from daily refuse main tenance activities but from periodic rituals (Hill, 1993, 1995b; Hingley, 1990b, 1993). Equally, the organization of settlement space cannot ade quately be explained in straightforward functional terms, but as an embodi ment of an Iron Age cosmology (Hill, 1995b; Fitzpatrick, 1994a; Foster, 1989b; Parker-Pearson, 1995; Parker-Pearson and Richards, 1993). Other studies build on similar approaches to consider the role of ritual and space in the reproduction of society, offering alternative interpretations of Iron Age social organization (Ferrell, 1995; Foster, 1989b; Hill, 1995a, b; Hin gley, 1984, 1993; Sharpies, 1991b). These new approaches have important consequences for all aspects of Iron Age studies which should be realized in coming years. THE NATURE OF THE BRITISH PRE-ROMAN IRON AGE The Pre-Roman Iron Age was a world of farmsteads, a changing land scape of small, dispersed, long-lived settlements often enclosed by a wall or bank and ditch and practicing mixed farming based on cereals, animal husbandry, and woodland management. A deteriorating cooler and wetter climate marked the first half of the third millennium B.P., followed by some amelioration toward the end of the period (Jones, 1995). Against this background, the PRIA landscape was one of constant flux through the piecemeal process of final permanent for est clearance, agricultural intensification, innovation, and expansion into marginal areas (Jones, 1995).</page><page sequence="8">54 Hill Evidence throughout Britain demonstrates that the layout of these en closed farmsteads was ordered by deep-seated cultural rules and ritual con cerns. For example, these specified that the house and settlement should be entered from the direction of the rising sun (Fig. 3). Settlements were also an important focus for rituals involving sacrifice, feasting, and the de liberate deposition of a range of material in specific parts of the settlement. Such rituals and cosmologies have been interpreted as extruding into all areas of the life of the household (Parker-Pearson, 1995; Hingley, 1993; Hill, 1994, 1995b). Circular buildings were the dominant architectural form throughout British later prehistory, in marked contrast to the rectangular houses found in Continental Europe (Audouse and Buchsenschutz, 1991). Other common structures included small, raised storage buildings and, in southeast Britain, storage pits/silos. The finds recovered from excavations of these sites, al though their deposition was clearly structured, provide evidence for the undifferentiated world of domestic, craft, and agrarian activities contained by such settlements. This repertoire of ceramic, metal, and bone objects has been extended through finds of organic architectural fragments and objects from excavations of waterlogged sites (e.g., Coles and Coles, 1986). Wood, basketry, and leather containers must have played a very important role, especially as most of Britain and Ireland was largely aceramic in this period. However, domestic life was probably drab, as there is little evidence for decorated or colorful woodwork or textiles (Evans, 1989b). Many set tlements were occupied for many generations, with individual houses often rebuilt on the same spot several times, and settlement layouts remodeled over their long use. Households and Settlements Such a picture is, of course, a caricature. While it is true that both larger and/or unenclosed settlements existed in some places, the single, ar chitecturally isolated household unit was the dominant settlement form throughout the period. However, its size, composition, and specific archi tectural expression varied through time and from one part of Britain to another (Fig. 4). A wide range of enclosed farmsteads of different sizes and shapes is known from southern Britain. They include the oval or D shaped sites of Wessex (e.g., Little Woodbury, Wiltshire; Winnall Down, Hampshire), small rectilinear settlements common across the English Mid lands (e.g., Fisherwick, Staffordshire; Haddenham V, Cambridgeshire; Park Farm, Warwickshire; Enderby, Leicestershire) and the so-called "banjo en closures" and associated sites with long funnel-shaped entrance passages</page><page sequence="9">H sr ft *n o 3 &gt; (TO ft 5* w ?. 5' w s a 2.

Continued.</page><page sequence="12">58 Hill leading into the main enclosure (e.g., Woodside and Dan y Coed, Dyfed; Micheldever Wood, Hampshire; Mingies Ditch, Oxfordshire). A similar range of different-shaped and -sized enclosed household units are known from west and north Britain (e.g., Walesland Rath, Dyfed; Collfryn, Powys; Rispain Camp, Galloway; West Brandon, Durham; Cornish "Rounds" such as Trevisker). These also include courtyard houses (e.g., Chysauster, Corn wall), duns, wheel houses (e.g., Jarlshof, Shetland; Clettraval, North Uist; Cnip, Lewis), brochs (stone "tower" houses, e.g., Mousa, Shetland; Gurness, Orkney; Sollas, North Uist), and crannogs (individual households demarcated by water; e.g., Milton Loch,, Galloway; Buiston, Strathclyde) (Cunliffe, 1991; Darvill, 1987; Hingley, 1993). Although enclosed settlements may be the dominant settlement form in some areas throughout the period, there may have been considerable changes in their size and form through time, and over a few tens of kilo meters, as Williams' (1988) study of settlement in southwest Wales clearly demonstrates. In northeast England/southeast Scotland changes in the size and form of these enclosed units through the period have also been iden tified, and linked to changes in households' food-producing regimens and strategies of social reproduction (Ferrell, 1995). This and other recent in terpretations have cast individual households as the fundamental units in understanding the constitution of PRIA societies, through their interaction and competition, growth and fracture, and changing structure and makeup (Hingley, 1984, 1993; Hill, 1995a, c). The archaeological record is biased toward enclosed sites which are more visible compared with unenclosed settlements. In some areas, and in some centuries, unenclosed settlements were the norm, with a consequence that little is known about settlement and mundane activities. This is true for Ireland throughout the PRIA (Raftery, 1994). In many areas there was a clear trend with time toward enclosure (e.g., East Anglia) or toward more massive/permanent enclosure (northeast England and southeast Scotland). Unenclosed settlements varied considerably in size and form. They ranged from individual houses scattered within fields (e.g., Garton Slack, Humber side), to unenclosed versions of isolated settlements (e.g., Prestatyn, Clywd; Newmill, Perth), to small rows of buildings (e.g., Roxby, North Yorkshire; Winnall Down, Hampshire; Kilphedir, Sutherland), to uncommon tightly packed clusters of houses (e.g., Little Waltham, Essex; Glastonbury, Som erset). Loose agglomerations of households are more common (e.g., Ashville, Oxfordshire; Mucking, Essex), although in many, individual house hold units were still spatially distinguishable (e.g., Gravelly Guy, Oxford shire), if not set within their own ditched/hedged enclosures. This arrangement of square/rectangular settlement compounds grouped together is a frequent feature of agglomerated settlements of ca. 300 B.C. onward</page><page sequence="13">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 59 (e.g., Catswater, Cambridgeshire; Dalton Parlours, West Yorkshire; Sil chester, Hampshire; Dragonby, Humberside; Poole Harbour, Dorset) (Fig. 4). In almost no case can any central focus be identified within such ag glomerated settlements or "villages." Agglomerated settlements appear to have been most common in parts of central and eastern England, although they are known outside (e.g., Thorpe Thewles, Cleveland; Beckford, Here ford, and Worcestershire). Such settlements were rarely the sole settlement form in an area and could be contemporary with small, enclosed settle ments. These may have been specialist units, such as banjo enclosures, within the complex utilization of the Oxfordshire Thames Valley (Lambrick, 1992). Alternatively, there could be conglomerations of single-compounded farmsteads, sometimes alone, sometimes in clusters of varying sizes (cf. Dal ton Parlours and other sites in West Yorkshire; Catswater with Haddenham V, Cambridgeshire). Throughout Britain, settlement size and form appear to have been pri marily products, and producers, of local social forms and not simply prod ucts of environment or simple economy (Hingley, 1984,1995; Ferrell, 1995). Thus during the second half of the first millennium B.C., one major river valley, the Thames, in central/eastern England was dominated by open, ag glomerated settlements, while in other valley systems such as the Trent, Avon, and Severn, individual, enclosed settlements were the norm (Knight, 1984; Hingley, 1989; Ellis et aiy 1994). Similarly, in eastern Scotland, en closed farmsteads were dominant south of the Firth of Forth, while to the north unenclosed settlements were the norm. These regions were also dis tinguished by the presence of large hillforts in the south, absent from the north, and the use of different types of metal work (Macinnes, 1982; Hin gley, 1993, personal communication). Houses The round house, a circular structure that was built with wooden, turf, or stone walls and roofed with thatch or turf, was the major building form across Ireland and Britain in the first millennium B.C. although the size and form of the round house varied in time and space. In southern and central England very large, "monumental," roundhouses were common during the first half of the first millennium B.C. (Late Bronze Age/Early PRIA). How ever, the size of houses, along with their monumental aspirations and possible central social focus, greatly diminished in later centuries. The reverse appears to have taken place in the north, especially in Scotland (Hingley, 1993; Foster, 1989b). Here houses of the first half of the first millennium B.C. were gen erally smaller and slighter structures, compared to the range of large monu</page><page sequence="14">60 Hill mental round houses constructed in the second half of the millennium. The best-known examples are the brochs: freestanding round stone tower build ings constructed from 200 B.C. (Armit, 1992; Hingley, 1993). Examples of these brochs include Dun Carloway on Lewis, Gurness on Orkney, and Mousa on Shetland. Northern houses may also have differed from southern houses through a possible different emphasis in their internal division and use. An emphasis on axial symmetry and radial partition in the north might be contrasted with a bipartite division, north:south, leftiright distinction either side of the entrance in southern buildings (Hingley, 1990; Fitzpatrick, 1994a; Parker-Pearson, 1995; Reid, 1989). Agriculture An unfortunate by-product of the increased and proper importance of scientific specialist contributions in PRIA studies is the artificial compart mentalism of our understandings of PRIA life. It is not realistic to attempt to separate the management of animal herds from plant husbandry in un derstanding agricultural practices or to separate this from pottery produc tion, metallurgy, social organization, and ritual. The numbers of individuals engaged in any "full-time" specialist activity throughout the period would have been negligible and all "craft" production, construction activities, and exchange (or warfare?) had to be scheduled within the household's agri cultural year. In all parts of Ireland and Britain, we are not dealing with subsistence economies, but surplus-generating economies in which house holds aimed to produce for their successful social reproduction and for competition with other households. The forms through which this surplus was consumed were shaped by dominant social discourses, often articulated and legitimated through ritual (Barrett, 1989; Hill, 1995b). The basis of these social forms rested on the exploitation of plants?as food, fodder, fuel, or building material (Jones, 1995). Mixed farming took place throughout Ireland and Britain, although the relative importance at tached to plant versus animal products, and to particular species, varied in space and time. At no period before or after is the archaeological evidence for food-producing regimes so dominated by cereal crops, nor, in the pre modern era, so concentrated on domesticated plants and animals (Jones, 1995). Wild animals and plants comprised a tiny contribution to the overall diet in most of Britain, although it is now clear that their exploitation and consumption were heavily surrounded by taboo and ritual (Grant, 1984; Hill, 1995b). Although across much of Britain the main focus would have been the fields surrounding/close to the settlement, it is clear that many households</page><page sequence="15">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 61 relied on members traveling some distances to supervise animal herds in summer pastures. Temporary seasonal settlements are known from river floodplains (e.g., Farmoor, Oxfordshire; Hesterton, East Yorkshire), estu arine marshes (e.g., Maere, Somerset), and, probably, forests and upland pastures. Such seasonal movements may have also been accompanied by other activities such as sea salt extraction or, in the forests of the Sussex Weald, clay winning, quern stone quarrying, and timber felling (Sue Ham ilton, personal communication). Similarly, in the wetlands of the southern Vale of York, iron production may have been a seasonal undertaking (Steve Willis, personal communication). The major underlying trends throughout the first millennium B.C. were the increased permanent clearance of woodland, intensification of land use, and expansion of intense utilization/settlement into areas of the landscape previously marked by episodic clearance and forest/scrub regen eration. The result was to produce a densely populated landscape at the time of the Roman conquest. Estimates of the size of the population ca. 1 B.C./A.D. are fraught with difficulties, but between 2 and 5 million peo ple appears to be a reasonable figure, similar to that for Medieval Britain (Fowler, 1978; Cunliffe, 1991; Millett, 1990a). These processes of agricul tural intensification, which Jones (1995) sees as inherently unstable, were accompanied by piecemeal agricultural innovation in terms of the adop tion of new species (e.g., domestic fowl), technologies (e.g., iron-tipped ard plows, the hand quern), and crop varieties (e.g., bread/club wheat, rye) (Jones, 1984, 1995). The latter often implies wide-reaching changes in households' time management, and age/sex divisions of labor and wider relations. Bread/club wheat, for example, required more intense and time consuming methods of cultivation including deeper plowing, greater fer tilizer inputs, and weeding (Jones, 1995). The pace of these innovations increased in the last two centuries of the PRIA, but followed no simple wave of advance model from southeast to northwest (van der Veen, 1992; Jones, 1995). For instance, bread wheat was probably taken up at the same time or earlier in southwest Scotland and northeast England than in south east England [e.g., Rispain Camp, Galloway Jones, (1995); Rock Castle, North Yorkshire (van der Veen, 1992)]. How local groups or individual households reacted to, or seized the opportunities afforded by, these long-term pressures was neither uniform nor determinist. Permanent settlement clearly expanded during the period, and by inference population grew, yet there has been almost no serious consideration of this central phenomenon [except in northeast England, where very detailed pollen studies have been combined with archaeological research; see van der Veen (1992), Haselgrove (1989), and Ferrell (1995) for summaries]. The detailed sociology and mechanics of this process of</page><page sequence="16">62 Hill accretion are poorly understood. Who moved [whole existing households, parts of households or new households, individuals (What age or gen der?)]? Why did they move? Need it be increased densities of people?it self a cultural specific judgment?or due to rules of inheritance and household dynamics or competition between households? How far would they have moved (a few kilometers, several 10s or even 100s)? Whatever the causes, it is clear that those groups moving to intensify exploitation of previously "marginal" areas were more open to agricultural innovation (Ferrell, 1995; Jones, 1985, 1995; van der Veen, 1992) and/or often sched uled larger parts of their annual cycle for specialist "craft" activities such as metal working, pottery production, quern stone production, and even exploitation of beaver pelts and bird feathers (e.g., Evans and Serjeantson, 1988; Haselgrove, 1989; Millett, 1990b; Sharpies, 1990). Craft Production and Exchange Craft production and exchange shared the same picture of diversity and variation as the agricultural regimes in which they were embedded. There was a general trend through time toward an increased scale of pro duction and specialization. Recent work, however, demonstrates that this was far from a straightforward process of increasing social complexity (e.g., Morris, 1994a, c; Ehrenreich, 1991, 1994; Haselgrove, 1989). There is little substantial evidence for centralized control of production and distribution in the bulk of PRIA communities, as has often been assumed (Morris, 1994a, b; Marchant, 1989; Hill, 1995a). Many settlement excavations of the Late Bronze Age and PRIA pro duce assemblages of chipped stone and flint tools and waste. Although usu ally ignored or dismissed as residual Neolithic or Early Bronze Age material, it is clear from recent studies that stone and flint tools continued in use alongside tools made from iron (e.g., Ford et aL, 1984; Martingale, 1988). Scientific analyses have made important recent advances in our un derstanding of iron, bronze, silver, and gold working in the period (e.g., Ehrenreich, 1985; Northover, 1984, 1994; Scott, 1991; Stead, 1984). Metal working utilized a wide range of ore sources within the British Isles, al though its most skilled practitioners clearly knew of Continental-wide de velopments and fashions. Working iron and bronze appears to have had several tiers of workers, although this need not imply a hierarchy (Ehren reich, 1991). A small number of skilled smiths produced complex and elabo rate objects such as swords, cauldrons, torques, and shields, and there is evidence that individual techniques were not widely disseminated (Salter and Ehrenreich, 1984). However, the manufacture of tools and other mun</page><page sequence="17">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 63 dane objects such as nails, etc., was widespread; almost every PRIA set tlement yields some metal working (smithing) evidence, although initial ore extraction was much more restricted. Whether this implies a widespread common knowledge of basic metallurgy or itinerant metal workers is not clear. The available evidence does, however, indicate that metal working was always a small-scale and short-term activity, with very little investment in long-lasting facilities. This picture applies to other activities, such as pottery production. Considerable work on pottery distribution is revealing its complexity and variability (Peacock, 1969; Morris, 1994a). Again, there was no investment in permanent production facilities such as kilns, although they rapidly ap peared after the Roman conquest. Models of increasing centralization of production through time are not supported by the evidence, although, in general, pottery may have been exchanged over longer distances in greater quantities toward the end of the period. Potters in Poole Harbour, Dorset, provided the majority of pottery for a large surrounding region ca. 100 B.C. to 100 A.D. (Brown, 1991; Hearne and Cox, 1994). This was not the situation in southeastern England at the same time, although this area was characterized by oppida (possible urban settlements) and an increasingly centralized polity. As such, in this case and in others, the organization of craft production cannot be simply equated with the level of (apparent) so cial complexity (Morris, 1994a). Similar studies on other products confirm this complex situation. Quern stone production in southern England ca. 200 B.C. to 50 A.D. did see the emergence of a few important sources (Peacock, 1987), yet in north ern England the reverse situation took place (Heslop, 1988; Haselgrove, 1989). Other important craft products exchanged over some distances in cluded glass beads, manufactured in a very restricted number of locations (Henderson, 1991), shale, jet, and salt, from both mineral sources and seawater (Morris, 1994b). To what extent wood and worked bone or textile products were exchanged over similar distances is unclear. The procure ment, raising, and exchange of other commodities, such as horses, hunting dogs, sea birds, pelts, and feathers, were also of social importance (Grant, 1984; Evans and Serjeantson, 1988; Hill, 1955b). To this list should also be added people and knowledge. Ritual Ritual has become an important focus of study in recent years (Cun liffe, 1992; Fitzpatrick, 1984; Green, 1986, 1992; Hill, 1995b; Hingley, 1993; Whimster, 1981; Wait, 1985). In the past, it has been assumed that there</page><page sequence="18">64 Hill Fig. 5. Ritual deposits on Pre-Roman Iron Age settlements. Deposit of human (above) and animal (below) carcasses in disused grain storage pits from Winnall Down, Hampshire (after Fasham, 1985; Hill, 1995c). was very little obvious ritual activity in this period, which is dominated by an archaeology of the domestic lacking the monumental aspects which typi fies the British Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. This was particularly ar gued because of the general absence of any archaeologically visible treatment of the dead or clearly ceremonial monuments for the bulk of the period. From the Late Bronze Age onward, it appears that excarnation was the normal mortuary practice, the bones not subsequently being buried. However, small numbers of human remains were deposited on Late Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements, as part of the dominant ritual traditions</page><page sequence="19">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 65 which involved the deposition of a range of domestic items including animal remains, broken tools, and pottery in primarily settlement contexts (Need ham, 1993; Whimster, 1981; Wait, 1985; Hill, 1995b) (Fig. 5). While most recent concentration has been on ritual activities on settlements, it is im portant not to neglect other locations for ritual activities within the land scape, such as wells, boundary earthworks, caves, and wet places such as springs, bogs, rivers, and lakes (Hill, 1995b; Hingley, 1990b, 1995; Fitzpa trick, 1984; Wait, 1985). A tiny number of formal burials, if poorly understood, are scattered across Britain and Ireland from the Late Bronze Age to MPRIA (Whimster, 1981) . However, the one clear exception is the "Arras Culture" in East York shire and Humberside (Stead, 1991a; Dent, 1982; Champion, 1994; Millett, 1990b). Here, a formal burial tradition involving La Tene style inhumations under square barrows, arranged in long cemeteries along preexisting land boundaries existed during the MPRIA. Examples of these cemeteries include Garton Slack, Garton Station, and Wetwang Slack (Stead, 1991a; Dent, 1982) . The majority of graves are poorly furnished, but a small number in cluded elaborate weapons, other metal work, and two-wheeled horsedrawn carts or chariots. The origins of this anomalous rite have been much debated with apparent links with burials in northeastern France used to argue for Gallic migration. However, there are several equally "anomalous" Late Bronze Age/EPRIA barrow burials in East Yorkshire and recent work on the settlements shows no discontinuity in terms of architecture or pottery (Stead, 1991a). Perhaps this local phenomenon should be interpreted as an other example of the use of material culture and social practices to distin guish radically one group of communities from its neighbors. This is a phenomenon of "regionalization" that typifies the PRIA in Britain and be yond, and that is one of its most marked characteristics. One possible difference between the western and northern parts of the British Isles and the south and east lay in their attitudes to the past. Only in the north and west were Neolithic and Early Bronze Age monu ments the focus of attention, be it as a location for burial (e.g., Kiltierney, Co. Fermanagh; Knowth, Co. Meath; Stackpole Warren and Plas Gogerd dan, Dyfed), building monumental round houses (e.g., Pool, Howe, and Quanterness, Orkney), or incorporation within central sites (e.g., Tara, Co. Meath) (Hingley, 1993, 1995; Murphy, 1992; Raftery, 1994). Hoarding and the deposition of metal objects in watery contexts were the most visible ritual activities of the Late Bronze Age. Dry land hoards of bronze objects ceased with the beginning of the Iron Age, although de posits of metal work in rivers, lakes, and bogs continued on a much reduced level (Bradley, 1990; Fitzpatrick, 1984; Hingley, 1993; Raftery, 1994; Wait, 1985). Other "watery deposits" included a few Mediterranean pots (Har</page><page sequence="20">66 Hill bison and Laing, 1974), wooden figures, such as from Ballachulish, High land, and Ross Carr, Humberside (Coles, 1990); food, pottery and agricul tural tools (Dairy, 1980; Hingley, 1993); and some human bodies, such as Lindow Man (Stead et al., 1986). The offerings of food and objects asso ciated with daily life are part of a general ritual focus on home and harvest that marks much of the PRIA (Hill, 1995b; Hingley, 1993; Wait, 1985). The deposits of metal work in both wet and dry locations increased in in tensity in the last three centuries of the PRIA across Britain, although their distribution was patchy with distinct clusters. The most important cluster was in central and northern Ireland (Bradley, 1990; Fitzpatrick, 1984; Raf tery, 1994; Wait, 1985). This period also saw the appearance of shrines and archaeologically visible mortuary practices. In southeast England, small single functional rit ual buildings, often within a square compound, were constructed from the first century B.C. These shrines or temples were often very similar in plan to contemporary structures in northern France, e.g., Hayling Island, Hamp shire; Chanctonbury Ring, West Sussex; Harlow, Essex; Fison's Way, Thet ford, Norfolk; and Uley, Gloucestershire (Wait, 1985; Gregory, 1991; Woodward and Leach, 1993). In different parts of Britain archaeologically visible mortuary practices begin to be carried out for at least some of the population (Whimster, 1981). Both of these processes involved humanly cre ating spaces for specific types of ritual for the first time in many centuries. Attention usually concentrates on the "Aylesford-Swarling" cremation rite in parts of southeast England, which represents the extension of north French cremation practices across the English Channel (Whimster, 1981; Fitzpatrick, 1994b; Haselgrove, 1984, 1989). However, this could be seen as a local and specific manifestation of a broader process with other con temporary, or even earlier, local manifestations in different parts of Britain. Individual or small cemeteries of burials, generally inhumations (a few in cluding swords), increasingly appeared in parts of England (especially in Cornwall, Devon, and Dorset), Wales, Scotland and Ireland from ca. 300 200 B.C. onward (Whimster, 1981; Murphy, 1992; Raftery, 1994; Collis, 1972). These formal burials and shrines and the metal work deposits of the Later PRIA could be interpreted as a diminishing of, or emerging al ternative to, the predominant domestic focus of ritual found in most of Britain in preceding centuries. "Central Sites": Hillforts, Oppida, and Royal Sites Hillforts have often been considered as central to, if not synonymous with, the study of the Iron Age (Fig. 6). These are large sites enclosed by</page><page sequence="21">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 67 Fig. 6. Comparative plans of hillforts (after Hogg, 1984; Cunliffe, 1991).</page><page sequence="22">68 Hill earthen or stone walls (ca. 3-20 ha), often on hilltops (Cunliffe, 1991; Darvill, 1987; Avery, 1976). The term is often incorrectly used to describe any upstanding later Prehistoric enclosure, however small. For much of this century they have been considered as the central places within PRIA socie ties. Originally seen as towns, hillforts were studied through the application of central place theory in the 1960s and 1970s when the use of Thiessen polygons to establish hillfort territories became de rigueur. This approach, combined with social evolutionary models of the redistributing chiefdom and traditional notions of a warlike Celtic society, can be seen in Cunliffe's (1984a, b) seminal interpretation of Danebury, Hampshire (cf. Gent, 1983). This hypothesis, that hillforts were the fortress residences of an elite, centers of craft production and exchange, and a focal point in the agricultural re gimes of the area, has become a very fruitful source of debate. Building on early critiques of the central place model (Collis, 1981), all aspects of this model have been criticized and tested against the available data (Stopford, 1987; Marchant, 1989; Sharpies, 1991a, b; Hill, 1995a; Mor ris, 1994c). The apparent military function of hillforts has also been ques tioned (Bowden and McOmish, 1987,1989; Hill 1995a, b). Furthermore, not all hillforts were built on hills; similar large enclosures could be low-lying, e.g., Stonea Camp, Cambridgeshire, and Heathrow Airport, Middlesex. In addition, analyses of the Wessex evidence do not appear to support the cen tral role of hillforts in managing production and exchange or as elite resi dences (Hill, 1995; Morris, 1994c; Sharpies, 1991a, b). Nor were all contemporary hillforts the same sorts of sites, with differences between sites in the same regions and between parts of Britain. Thus Scottish hillforts lack the crop storage facilities so central an element in dominant interpre tations of Wessex hillforts (Gent, 1983; Cunliffe, 1984a; Hingley, 1993). In sum, hillforts do not represent a single coherent chronological ho rizon across the country. Some are not Iron Age sites at all, but were built, and possibly primarily used, in the Late Bronze Age (e.g., some sites in the Welsh Borders and Southern Scotland such as the Breiddin or Croft Ambrey, Powys, or Elsdon Seat, Lothian). Others areas saw no hillfort con struction until much later than neighboring areas, as in East Sussex, Surrey, and Kent in the third to first centuries B.C. Most importantly, hillforts were built only over restricted areas of Britain and Ireland. Despite their as sumed centrality to the Iron Age, it is clear that most PRIA communities could reproduce themselves successfully without hillforts. Where hillforts were in use, recent interpretations have stressed their role as communal, ritual, foci (Bowden and McOmish, 1987; Sharpies, 1991a, b; Hill, 1995a; Hingley, 1993). It is clear also that their roles could differ across space and, on the same site, through time, as is shown by Maiden Castle, Dorset (Sharpies, 1991a). As such it would probably be wrong to envisage hillforts</page><page sequence="23">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 69 0_100_200 kms Fig. 7. The essentially mutually exclusive distribution of hillforts (filled circles) and the ritual deposition of La Tene-style metal work (hatched area) in Pre-Roman Iron Age Ireland (information from Raftery, 1994). as a coherent category of site with a corresponding single common function (Hill, 1995a). To use or not use hillforts was also clearly part of the marked regional differentiation that characterizes the PRIA. In the main, hillforts do not tend to occur in the same areas, or to be used at the same times, as deposits of weaponry and other metal work in graves or hoards (e.g., Bradley, 1992; Sharpies, 1991b). This is well illustrated in Ireland (Fig. 7) and also in East Yorkshire, where there were no hillforts in the area prac ticing barrow inhumation (Bradley, 1984; Raftery, 1994).</page><page sequence="24">70 Hill "Oppida" is a confusing, and probably inappropriate, label given to a variety of large enclosed sites which date to the first centuries B.C./A.D. (Cunliffe, 1991; Darvill, 1987; Haselgrove, 1989; Millett, 1990a). These sites are supposed to correspond to the "oppida" found in parts of contemporary temperate Europe, which are often seen as urban settlements (Collis, 1984b; Wells, 1990, but see Woolf, 1993a) (Fig. 8). Some of these sites became the locations of Roman cities and it has been assumed that oppida played an equivalent role in Pre-Conquest society (e.g., Colchester, Chich ester, Canterbury, St Albans). Two types of "oppida" are distinguished (Cunliffe, 1991; Darvill, 1987). Enclosed oppida are hillfort-sized enclosed sites but have been considered to be different from hillforts because of their location in river valleys, Later PRIA origins, and assumed different function. However, given the variety encompassed by the term "hillfort," and that many were not built on hills and were built late in the Later PRIA, it seems difficult to sustain the argument that hillforts are a fundamentally different class of site from that of enclosed oppida. This is particularly the case as no enclosed oppidum has been adequately excavated. "Territorial oppida" is a term used to describe series of large earthen banks and ditches which demarcate large areas (up to several hundred hec tares) of the landscape. Examples include the principal centers of Later PRIA polities in the southeast, e.g., Colchester, Essex; St Albans, Hert fordshire (Fig. 8); and Silchester, Hampshire, and Chichester, West Sussex. Problems of size, and that many are under modern towns, make the full understanding of such "sites" difficult. Many sites were clearly locations of high-status settlement, burial, and consumption of continental material. Such activities, though, were not restricted to these separated parts of the landscape, and the full relationships between what happened inside such "sites" and beyond are unclear. Nor were such sites restricted to the south east of England; they are now known from other parts of southern Britain (e.g., Gussage Cow Down, Dorset; Bagendon, Gloucestershire; and Hob Ditch, Warwickshire) (Corney, 1989; Hingley 1989; Trow, 1990). The north ernmost is the site of Stanwick, North Yorkshire (Fig. 8) (Haselgrove et al, 1990). These sites often appear to have been established on the margins of preexisting concentrations of settlement, coinage distributions, and other defined regional groupings (Haselgrove, 1976; Corney, 1989). This situation probably also applies to the classic territorial Oppida of the southeast such as St. Albans, Colchester, and Chichester (Haselgrove, 1976). The definition of a particular type of settlement, with a specific func tion, through the form of an earthwork system, and not through a consid eration of the actual evidence for the type of activities taking place within them, has hampered understandings of these and other contemporary sites.</page><page sequence="25">? a &gt; ore n 5" w 2.

Comparative plans of Late Pre-Roman Iron Age central sites (after Cooney and Grogan 1991; Haselgrove et al 1990; Hunn 1992).</page><page sequence="26">72 Hill It is clear that agglomerated settlements of considerable size existed at this time in different parts of southern and eastern England, some with evidence for long-distance exchange contacts, craft production, and wealth, but not enclosed at all by an earthwork system (e.g., Dragonby and Redcliff, Hum berside, sites within Poole Harbour, Dorset; Leicester, Leicestershire; Puck eridge-Braughing, Hertfordshire). Such sites may offer a better case for fulfilling the roles often ascribed to "oppida" than those sites defined as oppida simply because of the presence of earthwork enclosures. Whether earthwork systems existed or not, these "sites," such as St. Albans, Dragonby, Chichester, and Poole, ought to be envisaged more as settlement complexes or polyfocal settlement foci, rather than as nucleated settlements (Millett, 1990a). These sites appear to have often been a clustering of set tlements and activity areas, often prolific in finds but possibly individually short lived and mobile (Willis, 1993). If at all urban sites, they represent a form of urbanism unlike that found in the classical world or later Europe (Woolf, 1993a,c). Contemporary with the "oppida" are the "Royal Sites" found in the Irish Midlands such as Navan (Fig. 8), Co. Armagh; Dun Ailinne, Co. Kil dare; and Tara, Co. Meath (Raftery, 1994; Llyn, 1986; Wailes, 1990). These are complexes of large circular enclosures of varying sizes, often containing smaller circular enclosures (Fig. 8). Both Navan and Dun Ailinne were foci of some kind in the Late Bronze Age, and Navan has in close proximity at least two lakes which were the location for the ritual deposition of Iron Age metal work and human remains (Cooney and Grogan, 1991). Excava tions at small focal enclosures at all three sites have provided evidence for circular structures of timber posts, which may not have been roofed. The most spectacular is the "40-m structure" at Navan (Lynn, 1986, 1992; Robertson, 1992), with sue rings of timber posts and a large central oak post as much as 13 m tall. This structure was systematically filled in with stones soon after construction, the exterior deliberately burned and the cairn subsequently covered with a 2.5-m-thick layer of turfs. All these site complexes appear to have had a ceremonial function, with little evidence of settlement and other activities. They are referred to as the former cen ters of local kings in later oral histories and myths (Raftery, 1994). Social Organization The interpretation of hillforts and that of PRIA social organization have always been inextricably intertwined and have been the subject of in creasing debate in recent years (Haselgrove, 1994). In general there has been a shift from applying generalized notions of a "Celtic" or "Iron Age</page><page sequence="27">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 73 society" to specific interpretations of particular Iron Age social forms. This has been accompanied by more reluctance to assume that PRIA social forms were hierarchies and by explorations of heterarchical forms of or ganization (Armit, 1992; Ehrenreich, 1991; Hingley, 1984,1993; Hill, 1995a; Woolf, 1993a). Along with this has been an emphasis on the household as a basic unit of production and on the spatial organization of society as integral to its constitution (Ferrell, 1995; Foster, 1989a, b; Hingley, 1984, 1993; Hill, 1995a, c). Traditional models have taken generalized assumptions of a warrior based, hierarchical "Celtic" social form from classical writings and Medieval Irish heroic literature and applied them to the PRIA. This use of such an analogy has, however, been much debated. The most elegant and explicit uses of such an approach are those where this was combined with key ele ments of processual social archaeology (e.g., Clarke, 1972; Cunliffe, 1984a, b). Cunliffe's 1984 interpretation of hillforts clearly fits the "Celtic" approach with social evolutionary notions of the "chiefdom." Other ele ments of this approach are also contained in the different applications of core-periphery theory (e.g., Cunliffe, 1984c, 1988; Nash, 1984). These core periphery approaches rarely explicitly articulate the structural Marxist basis of the approach. They do see society as actually or potentially hierarchically organized around the competitive relations between lineages or clan groups (Haselgrove, 1982; Millett, 1990a). More recent approaches have moved away from these generalizing standpoints. Sharpies (1991b) interpreted change through the Wessex Iron Age by focusing on the changing emphasis on the individual versus the community. Other recent approaches have explored essentially Marxist analyses of exchange and production (e.g., Gosden, 1989) and, in some cases, have sought to understand specific PRIA communities through the conceptual tool of "the mode of production" (Hingley, 1984; Hill, 1995a, c; Ferrell, 1995). At the same time Barrett's (1989; see also 1994) discussions of the Late Bronze Age and Early PRIA have been important stages in developing an archaeology of social discourse. These recent approaches recognize that no single form of British PRIA existed. Rather the archaeological evidence demonstrates real differences in the ways communities were organized and the material resources of power drawn on in their constitution. While variations around the house hold mode of production, with little degree of stratification between house holds, may be applicable for much of the period, the nature, size, and ways in which the household was symbolized varied considerably. In other situ ations, though, different interpretations are necessary. The LPRIA in the southeast of England has clear evidence for marked social inequalities in</page><page sequence="28">74 Hill what might be regarded as a "complex chiefdom," if not in some degree a class-divided society. CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE PRE-ROMAN IRON AGE This outline has so far paid little attention to the changes that trans formed communities throughout the course of the PRIA. An unfortunate legacy of the Three-Age system is a tendency to talk about "Iron Age so ciety," etc., as distinct from "Bronze Age society," etc., so failing to rec ognise the differences in social organization, economy, and ritual within the Iron Age. This static tendency is not universal, but many accounts which discuss change tend to offer simple interpretations of increasing complexity through time, combined with the transforming effect of the withdrawal and resumption of long-distance exchange (e.g., Bradley, 1984; Cunliffe, 1984b; Haselgrove, 1982). Such accounts may be sustainable when discussing tra jectories within a single region but increasingly come unstuck when ex tended across the British Isles in general. As regional syntheses for many parts of Britain are still rare, and regional differences appear so strong, attempting to piece together an honest account of change throughout the period has proved difficult. After discussing the nature and problems of the current chronologies for the period, I outline what I consider to be the main changes within the period. To allow comparisons with other parts of Europe, I have used a basic chronological division between Hallstatt and La Tene periods. I do not discuss the Roman conquest of mainland Britain from A.D. 43 to A.D. 84, nor its consequences on those communities in corporated into the empire or for those which found themselves beyond its frontiers (see Millett, 1990a). Chronology Since the 1930s the mainland British PRIA has been divided into three periods based on pottery typology (Fig. 1): Early (EPRIA, ca. 700-450 B.C.), Middle (MPRIA, ca. 450-100 B.C.), and Late (LPRIA, ca. 100 B.C.-A.D. 43). While this chronological scheme is both successful and easily applica ble, it is important to recognize its attendant biases and problems. It could be argued that this tripartite division has contributed to the perceived dis tinctive and insular nature of the British PRIA compared to Continental</page><page sequence="29">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 75 Europe. There the Hallstatt and La Tene periodization is the standard chronology, not that of Early, Middle, and Late PRIA (Collis, 1984a; Wells, 1990). The Continental chronology is essentially based on metal work types and is applicable to British material (e.g., Stead, 1984). Such metal work, however, was rarely deposited in settlement contexts, and as there are very few graves in Britain, clear links between metal work chronologies and other chronologies are difficult to establish. Radiocarbon played an important role in demonstrating that Early PRIA ceramic forms were in use over a much longer period than previously assumed, and also belonged to the Late Bronze Age (Barrett, 1980). How ever, radiocarbon dating has not perhaps been as extensively used as it might have been. This is because prior to accelerator dating, it was not felt that radiocarbon provided the fine-enough chronological precision of fered by a pottery-based chronology. This was a particular problem for the first half of the first millennium B.C., when the radiocarbon calibration curve is marked by a major kink (Pearson and Stuiver, 1986). However, radiocarbon and other absolute dating techniques, such as dendrochronol ogy (Bailie, 1988), are the only way to establish chronology over most of Britain and Ireland. This is because the standard chronology is based on pottery, which is rare or completely absent over large areas in the west and north Britain. Even where pottery was used in quantities, such as southern England, it is probable that pottery is relied on too heavily for dating. While a par ticularly refined chronology has been established for Wessex by Lisa Brown and Barry Cunliffe (1984), similar detailed chronologies are not available elsewhere. It is also becoming clear that pottery is not an indicator primarily of chronology, but of ways of living, ritual practice, and social identity. For example, in parts of eastern England MPRIA pot forms are not replaced by new, Continentally inspired, forms in the first century B.C., as commonly assumed, but continued in use beyond the Roman conquest (Evans and Ser jeantson, 1988; Willis, 1993, 1995). Similar processes took place in other regions of Britain, such as southwest England (Quinnell, 1986), or have taken place at a local level in those areas which fully adopted LPRIA pot tery, with a delay of some decades between sites only a short distance apart. Where pottery is used to date sites, this has important ramifications. A further possible confusion is the ceramic dating of the beginning of the Iron Age to 800 B.C. by some writers, who may distinguish an Earliest Iron Age, or Transition phase (ca. 800-600), before an Early Iron Age "proper." This again arises from the pottery, which reveals no clear ty pological break at the beginning of the metallurgical Iron Age in Hallstatt C (ca. 700-600 B.C.) (Barrett, 1980). Furthermore, reliable absolute dates for early iron working or objects in Britain and Ireland are not numerous.</page><page sequence="30">76 Hill The current chronological scheme for Britain is outlined in Fig. 1, but it is clear that Iron Age specialists cannot afford to be complacent about their chronologies. Hallstatt Britain and Ireland ca. 900 to 450 B.C. The Bronze Age-Iron Age transition in Europe has recently been re viewed, stressing the need to move away from a view which saw the Bronze and Iron Ages as discrete and separate entities (S0rensen and Thomas, 1989). Work on both sides of the transition is revealing a complex picture of changes and continuities. Iron working was not a marked technological improvement and, as in other parts of Europe, began during the Bronze Age. As in Europe generally, the major change in the archaeological record is the cessation of the deposition of bronze objects and scrap in hoards. Exchange, use, and ritual deposition of bronze objects are the defining fea tures of the European Bronze Age, which created a complex web of social networks across the Continent (Champion et aL, 1984; Bradley, 1984, 1990; Barrett and Needham, 1988). In northwest Europe, including Britain, hoards and the deposition of metal work in rivers and bogs largely ceased during the Hallstatt C period ca. 700-600 B.C. (Llyn Fawr phase in Britain). At the same time iron copies of prestige bronze objects appeared for the first time. After this date, swords, axes, knives, and sickles were no longer made in bronze and the deposition of metal objects reduced to a trickle in Britain and Ireland (Bradley, 1990; Champion, 1989; Cooney and Gro gan, 1991; Taylor, 1993; Thomas, 1989). It is the end of those social prac tices which centered around bronze objects and sustained the dominant social discourse of the Later Bronze Age, that marks the beginning of the Iron Age rather than a break in settlement evidence or ceramics (Thomas, 1989). Where there is settlement evidence before the transition, this con tinues. Where there is no settlement evidence, as in Ireland, that pattern also continues (Champion, 1989). A possibly more significant transition in the archaeological record took place during the Middle Bronze Age, ca. 1500 B.C. (Bradley, 1991; Barrett et ai, 1991). It was then that the long emphasis on the construction and use of communal and funerary monuments that typified the Neolithic came to an end. For the first time, settlements and field systems became an in creasingly dominant component of the archaeological record. It was in these changes that the physical and social landscape of PRIA Britain had its immediate origins. The Late Bronze Age was a period of climatic de terioration, marked by an initial contraction of settlement in some areas, followed by the continued, gradual process of agricultural intensification</page><page sequence="31">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 77 and expansion that lasted into the Roman period. Burials and cremations almost ceased during the Late Bronze Age, while the ritual consumption of metal work increased. At the same time offerings of food, domestic ob jects, and human bones on settlement make their first appearance (Bradley, 1984; 1990; Hill, 1995b). These were to become the dominant ritual dis courses, the practices and ideologies they sustained and were sustained by, for much of the PRLA. Depositing bronze objects did not take place at the same intensity throughout Britain, or through the course of the Late Bronze Age (Ehren berg, 1989; Taylor, 1993). Eastern England and central Ireland had major concentrations of metal deposits with sustained contacts with other metal working and consuming centers in Europe. Other regions witnessed few hoards and a limited range of objects. During the Ewart Park phase (900 700 B.C.) of the Late Bronze Age, hoard deposits reached their peak in eastern England and Ireland. Contemporary with this abundant metal work were a number of enclosed "miniforts," at least one of which has with direct evidence for bronze working (Springfield Lyons, Essex) (Champion, 1994; Needham, 1992). Also contemporary were riverside sites such as Run nymede, Surrey, which were clearly involved in short and long-distance ex change. These types of settlements do not appear to have been occupied into the Llyn Fawr/Hallstatt C phase (700-600 B.C.) when hoarding dra matically stopped in eastern England (Taylor, 1993; Thomas, 1989; Cham pion, 1994). Weaponry continued to be deposited in the Thames and other rivers on a much reduced scale, even though the objects continue to show links with other parts of Europe (Bradley, 1990). In regions that witnessed the largest concentrations of deposits of bronze objects in earlier centers, hoarding appears to have ceased rapidly in the Llyn Fawr stage (Hallstatt C) (Taylor, 1993). However, in some of the areas that appear to have been marginal in terms of bronze deposition before, this phase saw an increase in the deposition of hoards (Thomas, 1989). These hoards are of a different character from the preceding phase and one included iron versions of bronze objects. In parts of Wessex the period ca. 800 to 600 B.C. saw the appearance of large midden sites, monumental rubbish tips (e.g., Potterne and East Chisenbury, Wiltshire) and the construction of very large round houses, often within large en closed farmsteads (e.g., Pimperne, Dorset; Old Down Farm, Hampshire; Dunston Park, Berkshire). Hillforts were built across Britain and Ireland from as early as 1000 B.C. Although geographically a widespread phenomenon, hillforts are found in dense concentrations in a narrow regional band in mainland Brit ain, "the hillfort dominated zone" (Cunliffe, 1991). In certain areas there were distinct flourishes of construction, although it is increasingly apparent</page><page sequence="32">78 Hill that many hillforts were occupied or used before the construction of sur viving ramparts. A major flourish in Wessex and the Cotswolds took place between ca. 650 and 500 B.C. Some hillforts continued in occupation in these areas into the MPRIA, often with increasingly elaborate defenses and changing social role. These "developed" hillforts appear to be particularly common in parts of Wessex where excavations at Maiden Castle, Dorset, and Danebury, Hampshire, have done much to illustrate their nature (Cun liffe, 1984a; Sharpies, 1991a). In other areas of the country episodes of hillfort construction or reoccupation occurred throughout the PRIA, e.g., Welsh border and Severn Valley ca. 300-100 B.C., and this episodic nature may conform well to Collis' (1981) crisis model of hillfort construction. Understandings of the first half of the first millennium B.C. look ap parently contradictory depending on whether interpretations concentrate on metal work or on settlement evidence. A clear break at the end of the Bronze Age is only supportable from the metal work evidence. This raises the questions both of the relationship between metal work and settlement and to what extent the division of prehistory into neat period boxes (or social systems), with distinct social, economic, and settlement organizations, is valid. It is not a case of whether the settlement or the metal work evi dence provides a truer picture of social realities at this time. Rather, it is that the evidence clearly shows us the need for dialectical explanations. One approach to this period is to see the ritual consumption of bronze and the tradition of ritual deposits on settlements as articulating (increas ingly) contradictory alternative social discourses available not just to dif ferent groups, but to the same individuals, across Britain and Ireland. The Bronze Age-Iron Age transition seen in this perspective becomes the long, but not inevitable, conflict and replacement of one dominant social dis course by another (cf. Barrett, 1989). La Tfcne Britain and Ireland ca. 450 B.C. to 100 A.D. The EPRIA and MPRIA show considerable continuity in settlement and ritual, but possible changes may be apparent that roughly coincide with the Hallstatt-La Tene transition across Europe ca. 500 to 450 B.C. On the Continent these changes are most marked in mortuary traditions and metal work styles (Collis, 1984a; Wells, 1990). In Britain there is no change in burial practice, except for the start of "Arras culture" burials in East York shire, which follow an indigenous variation on a La Tene mortuary theme. British metal work shows the adoption of La Tene styles, and the exchange of some continental La Tene objects, from the fifth century B.C. onward. Although British and Irish metal working develop their own local La Tene</page><page sequence="33">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 79 styles, parallels and a few objects show continuing links with other parts of Europe throughout the next 500 years (Stead, 1984; Raftery, 1994). The change from Hallstatt to La Tene also corresponds roughly with the change from EPRIA to MPRIA ceramics in southern Britain. EPRIA ceramics were the last manifestation of a long ceramic tradition, dating from ca. 900-1000 B.C. (Barrett, 1980; Elsdon, 1989). MPRIA (400-300 B.C. on ward) traditions have fewer clearly defined vessel forms and show greater sophistication and control in their firing (Elsdon, 1989; Morris, personal communication). What these changes in technology and vessel forms imply has not yet been investigated. The long centuries of the MPRIA appear on the surface to show little change, especially when contrasted with the LPRIA. Contacts with other parts of Europe and within the British Isles appear to be few. Rather, emphasis appears to have been inwardly or lo cally focused, as in other parts of La Tene B and C Continental Europe (Bradley, 1984; Collis, 1984). The ritual and economic focus centered on the reproduction of the household and agriculture. In comparison, the developments from ca. 100 B.C. appear to be a marked break from the MPRIA. This, the LPRIA, is chronologically marked by a range of new pottery forms, often copying north French or Roman originals, and a new technology, the fast potter's wheel, across southern England. In this 150 years, southern Britain enters the threshold of history, as the Roman empire expanded into France, Belgium, and Hol land, failed to conquer southern England in 55 and 54 B.C., and finally, incorporated much of Britain from A.D. 43 onward. In those parts of Brit ain close to France a series of marked changes in settlement, ritual, material culture, and political organization took place, which some have seen as the emergence of a moneyed, urbanized, state level of social organization by the eve of the Roman conquest (Champion et ai, 1984; Darvill, 1987). Cul turally, this part of England became increasingly like that of neighboring areas in France and Belgium. This situation continued, if not intensified, after the Roman conquest, leading to discussions of the "Romanization" of Britain prior to Claudius' invasion in 43 A.D. (Haselgrove, 1984; Millett, 1990a). For this part of Britain, the LPRIA is protohistoric, as Greek and Latin literary sources provide some evidence for political events, leaders and "tribal" groupings, geography, and culture. The earliest of these changes was the use of coinage. Haselgrove (1993) has outlined the development of British PRIA coinage in three main phases. The earliest coinages were concentrated around the mouth of the river Thames. Although with possible earlier antecedents, the main use and minting of coinage started in the midsecond century B.C., with both im ported northeast French gold types and local copies. The production of cast bronze coins, "potins," began toward the end of the second century</page><page sequence="34">80 Hill B.C. (Fitzpatrick, 1992b; Haselgrove, 1988, 1993). The functions of early coinage have been much debated, some seeing all coinage as primitive cash. However, detailed work on the circulation and deposition of coinages shows that not all PRIA coinages were the same. Gold and potin coins, the ear liest, would appear to have been used in quite narrow and specific social relationships (Haselgrove, 1987, 1988). During the first century B.C. gold, and increasingly silver and struck bronze, coinage was minted in large quan tities in southeast England. Silver and struck bronze coinages were circu lated and deposited in a quite different manner from gold, and probably fulfilled more cash-like roles. The use of coinage spread into a larger part of England stretching from Dorset to Lincolnshire, with the development of distinct local issues, which appear to correlate with sociopolitical group ings, or "tribes" (Fig. 9). This has allowed coinage to reconstruct the po litical history of southern Britain, especially with the development of inscribed series from ca. 20 B.C. which bear rulers' names. The coinage and few literary sources might suggest a situation of fluid "tribal" groups (although other interpretations are possible), with the emergence of two major political entities based in West Sussex and Essex, Hertfordshire, and Kent. Coin inscriptions, indirect evidence for papyrus, a few inscribed pot sherds, and writing equipment testify to some degree of literacy in the southeast before the Roman conquest. The links between Picardy and Kent, Essex, and Hertfordshire wit nessed in the coinage from the second century B.C. point to long-lasting social and kinship ties between the two areas. It was through these ties that components of a new, distinct, cultural package were learned about and adopted in southeast England. Important in these were changes in rit ual. Cremation burial, the "Aylesford-Swarling" rite, was adopted for some of the population (Whimster, 1981; Stead and Rigby, 1989; Haselgrove, 1984, 1989). Although burials were usually poorly furnished and in small cemeteries (e.g., Aylesford, Kent), a few were lavishly equipped and could be marked by small mounds ("barrows") or set within square ditched en closures. A few of these clearly belong to what the literary sources call "kings" and their relations (Lexden, Essex; St Albans and Welwyn, Hert fordshire). These rich "Welwyn-type" burials were furnished with imported French or Roman luxuries, but in all burials an emphasis seems to have been placed on drinking. Shrines or temples following Continental models were also used for the first time, often acting as locations for a range of votive offerings (see above). Meanwhile similar ritual practices which for merly took place exclusively on settlements decreased in importance. The rich graves show the increasing importance of exchange with France to obtain a range of luxuries originating there or further south in the Mediterranean. Imports included ceramic, metal, and glass vessels as</page><page sequence="35">s o. 2.

The main coinage distribution zones of LPRIA Britain (after Haselgrove, 1987).</page><page sequence="36">82 Hill sociated with eating and drinking (Trow, 1990). These, and locally made copies, demonstrate an increased concern with the semiotics of the meal and the use of eating and drinking as an active vehicle for social distinction and emulation. It is in this context that the consumption of exotic foodstuffs and drink, such as Mediterranean wine and fish paste transported in am phorae, must be set. The Mediterranean material should essentially be seen as a extension of the pool of material circulating in northern France. The scale and mechanisms of these exchanges have been revised recently, sug gesting that most took place through preexisting links of alliance and kin ship. Into such social networks, increased Roman political activities involving gifts and payments naturally fitted (Fitzpatrick, 1989; Haselgrove, 1982, 1989; Millett, 1990a; Trow, 1990). The final major changes in the southeast were, as outlined, the ap pearance of oppida (see above). Many of these sites include within their environs rich burials and high status settlements, indicating that they were foci for the developing political entities witnessed in the coins and literary sources. These social processes probably involved an increasing degree of social inequality and transformation of the existing social structure. An elite, possibly deliberately distinguishing itself in its social practices and material culture from the rest of society to a degree hitherto unknown in British Prehistory, was clearly evident. These processes of social differen tiation, if not class division, became permanently entrenched as the elite was deliberately maintained and encouraged by the Roman conquerors (Millett, 1990a). These polities were in direct political relationships with the Roman authorities from Caesar's failed invasions of southeast England in 55 and 54 B.C. onward. Some kingdoms were clients of Rome, and it is in the context of both political upheavals within the eastern British king dom and internal politics in Rome that Claudius invaded southern Eng land with the primary aim of conquering these "developed" polities (Haselgrove, 1984, 1989; Millett, 1990a). These developments appear as a sudden break and the obvious links with northern France supported the interpretation that they were the result of large-scale invasion and migration from Belgic Gaul (Mulvaney, 1962). Current interpretations continue to interpret change through external causes, now stressing the importance of the spread of the Roman influence into northwest Europe. These usually employ elements of core-periphery theory to explain the developments in the peripheral regions as the product of changes in the Mediterranean core. The most important and sophisti cated application of this approach to Britain also envisaged the local core periphery relations that arose from external stimulus of southeast England (Haselgrove, 1982). This popular model interprets the developments in the southeast as constituting a local core, around which peripheral communities</page><page sequence="37">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 83 A Roman and/or Gallo-Belgic imported pottery B Cremation cemetery ? ?

Haselgrove has also argued that this regional core coexisted on both sides of the English Channel and that the sea was not in this case a barrier (Haselgrove, 1984). However, the basis of this dominant model has come under question with new discoveries and research, much by Colin Haselgrove himself (1988, 1989, 1995). These questions center on how radical a break from previous social patterns these developments were, which were restricted to</page><page sequence="38">84 Hill one small (peripheral?) part of the British Isles. Does the emergence of this, like other geographically and chronologically restricted clusters of rich graves and Mediterranean imports in the European Iron Age, represent a fundamental structural change or a brief aberration crystallized by the Ro man conquest (Haselgrove, 1995)? Was this phenomenon a sudden break with the past, as interpretations which stress external causes usually assume, or the result of a series of deep-rooted internal changes during the MPRIA (Haselgrove, 1989)? To answer these questions it is necessary to return to the "dull," agrar ian, worlds of the MPRIA. It is possible to argue that a series of broad changes took place across Britain and Ireland as a whole from ca. 300 B.C. Not all are found everywhere, nor should they be seen as having the same causes; however, these changes strongly support suggestions that there was no radical break at ca. 100 B.C., with the start of the LPRIA, more an acceleration in some regions. From 300 B.C. onward the archaeological record becomes generally fuller and more visible. Not only are more sites known (a result of both expanding numbers and increasing archaeological visibility), but all classes of material culture become more numerous, and new classes of objects ap pear for the first time. While little studied, settlement expansion into previously marginal ar eas may be the most important of these underlying changes (see above). The results of settlement expansion were not simply more people and more land under more intense exploitation. Expansion was accompanied by the laying out of extensive field systems in some areas and a concern with de marcating large tracts of land, as expressed in territorial oppida. These processes were also accompanied by a range of agricultural innovations (see above). If a generalization can be made, it is that those groups moving into previously "marginal" areas appear to have been more innovative than others. It is in these situations that groups appear to have been more open, or were forced by circumstances, to change, experiment, specialize, and cre ate new forms of relationships within and between households (e.g., Ferrell, 1995; Haselgrove, 1989; Hingley 1984; Jones, 1985, 1995; Sharpies, 1990; van der Veen, 1992). Increased scheduling of time away from food produc tion in many of these households would necessarily entail the forging of new, or changing of old, relationships with others to exchange produce. Equally, new households moving into previously marginal areas would lack the deep-rooted relationships between neighboring households that would characterize older areas of settlement. As already noted, many of the ter ritorial oppida appeared in what could be described as "marginal" areas (e.g., St. Albans and Puckeridge-Braughing, Hertfordshire; Chichester,</page><page sequence="39">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 85 West Sussex; Silchester, Hampshire; Gussage Cow Down, Dorset; Grims Ditch, Oxfordshire; Stanwick, North Yorkshire). Accompanying these changes was the appearance of new settlement forms across Britain. It would appear that from ca. 200 B.C. onward, the Royal sites of the Irish midlands were under construction. In north and west Scotland various forms of monumental round houses, most notably the broch, were constructed in increasing numbers from ca. 200 B.C. (Ar mit, 1989, 1992; Foster, 1989b; Hingley, 1993). In southwest England, a new form of small enclosed household unit, the round, appears from ca. 150 to 50 B.C (Quinnell, 1986). In northeast England, new forms of square enclosed settlements, housing apparently smaller-sized households than earlier oval sites, were established on the heavy soils only then undergoing permanent clearance (e.g., West Brandon, Durham, and Thorpe Thewles, Cleveland) (Ferrell, 1995). In the southeast, agglomerated settlements be came more common, accompanied by a process of compartmentalization. This describes the process whereby activities previously contained within one single large enclosure were distributed across a number of smaller, more specialist function enclosures (Hill, 1995b). Distinct animal paddocks, for example, appear on settlements for the first time. A similar process may have also taken place within the landscape, with distinct locations now set aside for ritual, burial, elite settlement, etc. Part of these changes would seem to lie in a shift of emphasis away from the immediate community to the individual (Sharpies, 1991b) and to more socially distant ties. A minority of individuals became archaeologically visible, as they were now marked out for mortuary rites involving burial, often with some grave goods. Certainly, over large parts of Britain objects that can be directly associated with individuals or the human body appear on sites and off sites in increasing numbers (Sharpies, 1991b; Hill, 1995b). Brooches, fibulae, from the EPRIA and MPRIA are surprisingly rare, but a distinct feature of the first centuries B.C./A.D. is what might be called the "fibula event horizon," the sudden explosion of brooch numbers de posited on sites. Fine metal work and weaponry began to be deposited in watery places, on dry land, and in graves in increasing numbers and in an expansion of different types from ca. 300 B.C. onward (Fitzpatrick, 1984; Raftery, 1994). Its distribution is patchy, important clusters occurring in Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and Lincolnshire ca. 300-50 B.C., southern Scot land ca. 100 B.C.-ca. A.D. 100, and, most notably, north and central Ireland from ca. 250 B.C to ca. A.D. 100. These changes and developments do not fit together in any neat man ner and may appear to be contradictory to each other. However, they place those developments in southeast England in a fuller context and suggest that the appearance of broches, the establishment of the Poole Harbour</page><page sequence="40">86 Hill 56 55 58 5954 60 53 49 52 47 48 0 46 45 51 50 44 42 2 40 41 3 88 9 5 37 39 35 33 10 11 36 32 6 -7 12 13 31 27 30 1 25 24 28 292 20 22 15 16 17 199 3 01 216kn</page><page sequence="41">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 87 pottery industry, the "oppida" at Stanwick, and the Aylesford-Swarling-type burials were linked in some convoluted way. The changes in southeast England, and their close relationship with northern France, clearly have their antecedents in the links evident in the coinage from ca. 250 B.C. onward. That is a century and half before the accepted date for the beginnings of Roman influence in northwest Europe, ca. 120 B.C., and the clearest evidence for Mediterranean contacts with southeast England, ca. 100 B.C. onward (Fitzpatrick, 1992b; Haselgrove, 1989, 1993). In fact, the earliest evidence for French and Mediterranean objects arriving in Britain is found in western England, especially Dorset, from ca. 120 B.C. Sites such as Hengistbury Head, Dorset, and Mount Ba ton, Devon, appear to have been "ports of trade," but the causes, nature, and impact of these contacts are subjects of debate (Cunliffe, 1987, 1988, 1994; Sharpies, 1990, 1991a, b). The debut of this exchange coincides with a series of changes in Wessex including the appearance of territorial oppida such as Chichester, West Sussex, and field systems in parts of Dorset and the development of the Poole Harbour pottery industry, along with an abandonment or changing use of hillforts (Cunliffe, 1984b, 1994; Fitzpa trick, 1994b; Sharpies, 1991a, b). Whether the cross-channel exchange was a cause or effect, these developments in part of the "periphery" appear to predate the rich burials and associated developments of the "core" of Hert fordshire, Essex, and Kent. This pattern also appears to be true in the northern part of the "pe riphery"; Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, etc. These areas maintained, like Dorset, a strong regional identity in comparison to the "romanization" or "gallicization" of the southeast. MPRIA pottery forms continued in use in parts of this area till around the Roman conquest (Willis, 1993). French and Roman imports and cremation burials were rare, but in stead a range of decorated metal work was deposited (Martin, 1988). In Fig. 11.

These parts of eastern Eng land witnessed the ritual consumption of elaborate metal work throughout the MPRIA on a scale greater than that typifying most of Britain, be it as dry and wet deposits or in graves in the 'Arras" culture of East Yorkshire. This included the deposition of many elaborate bronze, silver, and gold torques, or neck rings, in this region. At Snettisham, Norfolk, over a hundred torques have been found predating the Roman conquest of France (Stead, 1991; Fitzpatrick, 1992a). If the use of these prestige objects does relate to possible social inequalities and developments, this suggests that this sup posed "peripheral" region was an area of important social developments ca. 200-50 B.C.?before the bulk of the developments in southeast England. These processes involved the creation of a distinctive material cultural iden tity for this areas, often slow to change in the face of later gallicized and romanized material cultures and practices from the south (Fig. 8). It is in this context of local differentiation and cultural opposition to developments in the neighboring "core" polities to the south that later developments in East Anglia must be set, such as the construction of the multiditched en closure at Thetford, Norfolk, and Boudicca's rebellion in the area against Roman rule in 64 A.D. (Martin, 1998; Gregory, 1991). This is not to detract from the extraordinary developments witnessed in southeast England in the LPRIA. Nor is it to suggest that these polities did not become dominant influences across much of southern England, a success linked to the spread and emulation of their material culture and social practices. It does demonstrate, however, the great complexity that archaeological research is revealing for the La Tene period. Furthermore, it suggests that the initial adoption of northeast French culture and prac tices must be seen in the context of the "regionalization" that is a marked feature of the PRIA. I have illustrated this process of the active creation and maintenance of local identities through the use of domestic architec ture, ritual practices, and material culture in distinctive ways with several examples. The process does not imply isolation or little contact between groups. Rather we must envisage quite the opposite. Millett (1990b), fol lowing Hodder, has argued that such strong local identities develop in the context of regular interregional contacts. If material culture and social prac tice are closely bound to the specific constitution of social forms (Barrett, 1994), then these great variations in settlement form, ritual, and mundane things across Later PRIA Britain and Ireland were not local variants on the same essential underlying type of social organization. They point to considerable variety and incongruities in the ways societies were organized. Equally, this evidence does not appear to support a simple core and pe riphery explanation of change in these later prehistoric societies.</page><page sequence="43">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 89 This is possibly best illustrated through the changes that took place in central and north Ireland in the La Tene. These developments have often been overlooked by scholars working on mainland Britain, as have their wider implications for European prehistory. Out of an apparent "dark age" with negligible evidence for settlement, burial, or metal work deposits from the Bronze Age-Iron Age transition onward, the period from ca. 250 B.C. is marked by a sudden tremendous floruit of metal work deposits and the appearance of the royal sites (see above) (Raftery, 1994). These both appear to share an exclusive distribution with the few hillforts in Ireland, which are found in the south (Fig. 7). Dendrochronology has shown that sites such as the Navan 40-m structure (95/94 B.C.), large lin ear (boundary?) earthworks such as the Dorsey, Co. Armagh (95 ? 9 B.C.), and the substantial timber trackway at Corlea (148 B.C.), Co. Longford, indicate the cutting of timber and mobilization of labor on a huge scale over a comparatively short period of time (Bailie, 1988; Raftery, 1994; Robertson, 1992). These developments would appear to indicate a considerable degree of social hierarchy (Raftery, 1994; Robertson, 1992) and have wider im plications. What, for example, is the connection between the concentra tion of metal work deposition, the greatest within PRIA Britain, and the metal work deposits of the first century B.C./A.D. in north Wales and southern Scotland? How did these changes in central and north Ireland impact on neighboring parts of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales? There is a marked absence in Ireland of the Roman or Continental imports that are an important feature of southeast England, northeast France, or south Scandinavia on the first centuries B.C./A.D. The exception is a sin gle skull from a northwest African Barbary Ape at the Navan (2150 ? 70 B.P. OxA 3321). This absence in Ireland should question how we identify "core" areas in the European PRIA. The changes in Ireland have been largely ignored by both British and Continental Iron Age specialists. Why? Is it because they do not conform to our expectations of what should constitute a "core," or "hot spot," in Later Prehistoric Europe? How many other similar concentrations of activity, "wealth," and social hierarchy are we failing to recognise, because we expect "cores" to be marked by a combination of Mediterranean objects, quasi-urban sites, and richly furnished graves? Conclusion: Ireland and Britain in the European Iron Age Iron Age Ireland and Britain have tended to be considered as distinct, separate, and marginal to the mainstream of temperate Europe. Most ac</page><page sequence="44">90 Hill counts of the European Iron Age, written by both British and non-British writers, usually contain few references to Britain or Ireland. While there are both sociopolitical and archaeological reasons which strengthen this perceived British difference and marginality, this situation also applies for the majority of temperate Europe, the archaeology of which is also largely ignored in accounts of the "European" Iron Age. Such accounts usually concentrate on key hot spots and features such as rich burials with Medi terranean imports or oppida (Champion, 1987). The result is often to con centrate on a geographically restricted part of eastern France and southern Germany, with neighboring areas, and consider the rest of temperate Europe as essentially similar or marginal. However, I would argue that the Iron Age communities of the Atlantic coast of France, northern Sweden, or southwest Wales are as equal a part of a European Iron Age as those in southern Germany. More importantly, as this paper has shown, the wealth of data from this one peripheral European region, Britain and Ire land, ought to raise important questions about current assumptions and interpretations of the European Iron Age as a whole. This is to argue that Britain and Ireland were not peripheral to the main developments of the European Iron Age; rather they demonstrate many of the key underlying changes, themes, and problems that apply to the archaeology of other parts of temperate Europe. The rapid cessation of dry land hoards of bronze objects at the end of Hallstatt B, followed by the decrease in the numbers of prestige objects, often originating long distances from their place of final deposition, from wet places and graves over the following centuries, is not a unique feature of Britain and Ireland. As such, the apparent "isolation" of Britain from ca. 400 to 100 B.C. cor responds exactly to the lack of evidence for much long-distance contact (especially with the Mediterranean) across most of La Tene B and C tem perate Europe. While Britain and Ireland may lack the "La Tene style" inhumation burials that characterize this period in central Europe (except in eastern Yorkshire), it is important to recognize that such a burial rite, along with the ritual deposition of La Tene "Celtic" style metal work in other contexts, was not a uniform practice across temperate Europe. Equally, concentrating on such burials and art objects may detract from understanding what appears to be the common feature of these centuries, namely, the expansion of settlement and population, and its social causes and consequences. As argued above, it is in this general phenomenon, how ever varied its local manifestations, in which the developments of the LPRIA (La Tene C2/D) across Europe must be set. If Britain and Ireland are not dismissed as peripheral, then the increasing rich and complex data they provide for understanding oppida, coinage, long-distance exchange, etc., ought to have an important contribution to interpretations of possible</page><page sequence="45">The Iron Age in Britain and Ireland 91 urbanization, state formation, and the impact of the expanding Roman world in other parts of LPRIA Europe. It is this rich interplay of archae ological discoveries and changing approaches of interpretation, combined with the large quantity of high-quality data easily accessible to English speaking scholars, that makes Pre-Roman Iron Age Britain and Ireland both a rewarding and an exciting area in which to study early complex societies.
