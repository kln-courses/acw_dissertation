Ridgeway. 37 The Dramas and Dramatic Dances of Non-European Races, in special reference to the Origin of Greek Tragedy; with an appendix on the Origin of Greek Comedy. By William Ridgeway, Sc.D., F.B.A., Cambridge, University Press, 1915. Professor Ridgeway "was ever a fighter." In this ample and profusely illus- trated volume he has been moved to defend himself against critics who have attacked his theory on the origin of Greek tragedy, and to carry the war into the enemies' country. It will be remembered that the theory is that Greek tragedy arose from the periodical observances at the graves of the illustrious dead-that is to say, from "the indigenous worship of the dead"-and not from the worship of the Thracian god Dionysus; moreover, that if it did arise out of the worship of Dionysus, Dionysus himself was nothing else than a dead man. In the opening chapter of the present volume he discusses in detail the opinions of Miss Harrison, Sir James Frazer, Mr. F. M. Cornford, Professor Gilbert Murray, Dr. Farnell, and others, and pokes much fun at Mannbardt and the Tree-spirit theory, the Demon of the Year, and so forth. And he insists in true scholarly fashion on the necessity of distinguishing between the earlier and the later accounts, and on the greater authority to be conceded in general to the former. Having vindicated his position as regards the origin of Greek tragedy against his opponents, he turns to other lands to find analogous cases, beginning with Western Asia. A long and interesting account of the Persian passion play is wound up with the inquiry: "Who will deny that Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hassan, and Hussein "are as historical as Thomas a Becket, Charlemagne, Julius C~sar, or Jesus of "Nazareth ?" Nobody will deny it. But then nobody has denied that many dead persons have received the honours of canonisation, and indeed of apotheosis. It is when he seeks to put Adonis, Attis, Osiris, and Dionysus on the same footing as Muhammad and the others that we begin to be restive. For these mythical figures there is no historical evidence. Their legends are self-contradictory. It requires no Tree-spirit theory, no belief in an eniautos-daimon, to refuse to accept them as dead heroes. Sir James Frazer has gone too far in admitting that Osiris was a real man. The Memnonium at Abydos may have been believed to be his burial-place. It was built apparently under the twelfth dynasty,, and so far as it has been excavated (if rightly identified) it is empty. Now it is suggested that Osiris was a king of the first dynasty. But between the first dynasty and the twelfth lies an interval of two thousand years, to say nothing of the confusion and changes involved in the Hyksos' invasions and conquest. Of what value as historical evidence is a building erected after this interval for the tomb of a king attributed to the first dynasty ? Of what value is it that "under the New Empire it was boldly asserted that Abydos possessed "the veritable body of Osiris"? During the long Egyptian history it came to be believed that King Khent, one of the kings of the first dynasty, was Osiris. The tombs of the kings of the first dynasty were at Peqer, a mile and a half away from Abydos, and that of King Khent was among them, doubtless containing its proper tenant. Was Osiris buried at both places ? The Egyptians, however, were not satisfied with two tombs. Under the twenty-second dynasty, more than a thousand years later than the foundation of the Memnonium, they built him a cenotaph at Peqer. Why a cenotaph ? They might as well have provided him with a third [58]</page><page sequence="2">April, 1916.] MAN. [No. 37. veritable body. Or if they seriously held that King Khent was Osiris, would it not have been suifficient to magnify and embellish his existinig tomb ? The ceiiotaph is evidence that they did not, in fact, know where Osiris was buiried. Accordiilg to Greek report Osiris was identified also with Men, founder of the kingdom, but Professor Ridgeway thiinks this was a Greek blunder. At all events he was identified with the Sun, and with Apis, and a variety of other gods. Surely all this means that the Egyptians really knew nothing about Osiris the man, and that the belief in his humanity was a seconidary growth. They lhad the divine legends, a mass of contradictory, marvellous, impossible tales, as such lhagiologies always are, but they had no historical record. To assert the historical existence of Osiris as a man is to assert what in the present state of our knowledge is quite incapable of proof. From Egypt Professor Ridgeway proceeds to Hindustaii. He scores some excellent debating poilnts againist Dr. Keith ; and the chapter coiltains an interesting summary of the Ramayana and( the Mfahabharata, as well as a valuable account of Hindu drama aind the shadow-plays. It is, however, to nmake a large demand on our belief to require uis to accept as real live men two such typical Hindui fairv- tale heroes as Rama and Krishna, the seventh anid eighth incarniations of Vishnu. But Professor Ridgeway is not satified with this "bag." He flies at higlher game. The Hinidus do undoubtedly accord divine honours to some men, both dead alid living. Now the great god Siva, the third of the Trimnurti, recognised in the epics and Puranas as the supreme god, is of obscure origin and iitterly uinknowii to the Vedas. " There can be little doubt," says the Professor, "tlhat, as is held by the " best authorities, Siva was originally a real mian, who rose graduially to the great " place which he holds now in the divine hierarchy by the process so well described " by Lyall." I do not know who "the best authorities" are. At any rate Lyall is not one. After describing the process of apotheosis, Lyall says (Asiatic Studies, i, 49): "It may almost be doubted whether any god, except the Vedic " divinities and other obvious nature gods, comes do-wnl the ladder [sc., to maiihocd again as ani embodiment or incarnationi of the divinity] wlho had not originally goile up as a man, and an authentic man. The ascent of the elder Hindu deities " is shrouded in the haze of past times; but several of the most enminent (Siva and " Krishna, for instance) are still vulgarly reported to have been men." Tlhus he will not commit himself to the assertion that either Siva or Krishna was originally a man. On the contrary, his inclination is evidelitly to believe that those gods who are deified men do not attain any great distinction. " To quote examples," he says, "would be only to give a list of provincial deities, mnore or less obscure." And a little farther on: "Without doubt the Vedic deities, and a good maniy others which " prevail in Inidia, have been produced by filner anid more intelligent hanidicraft," sc., than apotheosis. Elsewhere (Asiatic Studies, ii, 306) he declares expressly: " Siva repre- " seints what I have taken to be the earliest and unliversal impressioii of Nature upon " men-the impression of eildless and pitiless change. . .. In Siva we have the " condensation of the two primordial agencies, tlle striving to live and the forces that " kill ; anid thus, philosophically speakinig, we see in this great divinity a compre- " hensive transfiguration of that idea which . . . I liold to be the most natural " religioni." In other words, lie does not hold Siva to be a deifiedi man ; and he is as little inclined to see a deified man in Vishnu. So far as I call gather, his view is indeed the converse of Professor Ridgeway's. He seems to hold that the great Nature gods were primary, and the apotheosised men, numnerous though they may be, are only secondary and subordinate phenomenla in religion- at ally rate in the religion of India. On the whole, however, Professor Ridgeway m-akes good his point that Krishna [ 59 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 37.J MAN. [April, 1916. and Raina are not vegetation demons or solar abstractions, whatever else may lie at the root of their mythical forms. The evidence is not conclusive that they were real historical personages. Much allowance nmust be made for the human habit of con- densing into human form beings imagined from whatever cause. This the author is apt to forget. When he finds stress laid on the human side of an heroic figure, he contends that it is because the god or hero was once a man. This does not follow. Popular belief is good evidence of the direction of popular imagination and popular sympathies; it is very poor evidence of a matter of objective fact. From Hindustan we are led to the Further East. The Thirty-seven Nats of Burma are described in detail. Certain of them seem to have been actual persons; abouit others we take leave to doubt. Special ceremonies are performed in honour of each of them, and the votary on whom desceends the divine afflatus dances and sinlgs in a special garb; but this is not uncommon. Many of the Chinese gods are said to be deceased human beinigs; and, of course, ancestor-worship has a prominent place in the religious system of China. Solemn dramatic dances were formerly held in the ancestral temples, and dramatic performances are still held in the temples of local deities-perhaps the direct descendanits of the ancestral temples and the dances performed therein. So far the Chinese facts favour Professor Ridgeway's thesis. What is wanted is evidence that in no other temples than these are such dramas or dramatic dances performed. In Japan by no means all the gods are human ghosts. This is abundanitly clear from the author's own citations, as well as from other passages of the Japanese chronicles. Nor can it be for a moment admitted that the attach- ment of extravagant legends to the name of a personage is a proof of his existence. It is only evidence of the belief of later (frequently mueb later) ages. For proof of his existence we must resort to genuine historical records, or to facts (outside the legends) authenticated by history, which cannot be explained without postulating his existence. Professor Ridgeway cites a number of cases of dancing, observing that "All alike seem to spring from the widespread custom of pleasing living kings and " other great personages by dancing before them, anid from the natural extension " of this custom to heroic personages and divinities." But dancing is so old and universal an inistitution that he can hardly mean to limit it to these cases, whatever the context nay suggest, especially if by "heroic personages and divinities" we are to understand the ghosts of deceased men. Was the Lord before whom Miriam and David danced nothing but such a ghost ? The fact is that dancing as a religious exercise is no evidence as to the character and origin of the divinity honoured. I am uinable to see that the Japanese Wind-gods are anything but examples of anthropomorphism, or that they are "not ancient," or that the calenldar festivals are no more than festivals in honour of the dead. It is true that certain of their ancestors were honoured. But Sbinto, though including mnuch worship of the dead, is by no means that alone. The late W. G. Aston, a profound Japanese scholar, came, after his researches, to a conclusion almost diametrically, opposed to that of Professor Ridgeway. "The importance," he says (Shinto, 36) "of the deifi- " cation of human beings in Shinto has been grossly exaggerated both by European " scholars and by modern Japanese writers. ... The truth is that Shinto . " has comparatively, little worship of human beings. In the Kojiki, Nlihongi, and " Yengishiki we meet hardly aniything of this element. None of their great gods are " individual human beings, though at a later period a few deities of this class attained " to considerable eminence and popularity." And elsewhere (43): "Even in the " case of the deification of living anld dead Mikados there is much room for suspicion of foreign influence. Of the deification of other men I find no clear evidence in " the older records. It is probable, however, that some of the numerous obscure [italics mine] deities mentioned in the Iojiki and Nihongi are deified men. A [ 60 ]</page><page sequence="4">April, 1916.J MAN. [No. 37. number of the legendary and historical personages named in these works were " deified at a subsequent period. Others have been added from time to time." In short, apotheosis was a secondary and subordinate source of godhead. Of the people of Australia nothing is more certain than thiat they are not addicted to the worship of the dead. Among the central tribes, Professor Ridgeway rightly says, "that the essentials of their religious and social life depend on their belief " in the spirits of their ancestors." But they did not worship those ancestors, though their totemic ceremonies were rudimentary dramatic performances. It is doubtful whether anytlhing that can be properly called worship of any being has ever been practised by the Australian aborigines. The nearest approximation is perhaps in the case of the Wollunqua; and he is an imaginary and gigantic snake. Even if the tribes of New South Wales worshipped Daramulun, there is no substantial evidence that he was a ghost. The assertion that totemic beliefs in general are based upon the primary belief in the immortality of the soul needs much more evidence than the author has afforded, even though we should not hold him to the literal wneaning of the phrase, " immortality of the soul," in which no savage people known to mne believes. Why, by the way, does the author quote only at secondhand from a book so easily accessible at Cambridge as the Reports of the Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits ? Professor Ridgeway, in the course of the volume, raises in effect the fundamental question of the origin of religion, though he does not fully investigate it. He justly points out that the Melanesian mana is " a quality frequently possessed by ghosts," and draws the inference that it is a phenomenon seconidary to the belief in the continued existence of the soul after death. But mana, as I have elsewhere (Ritual and Belief, 36-61) shown, is itself a development of a widespread atnd vaguer notion of a mysterious power or energy not necessarily resident in any humain being, alive or dead. It seems to be in its essence impersonal, though liable to be personalised whenever it is conceived as acting. Hence it is not dependent on the belief in ghosts, and the criticisms directed in this respect to the Melanesian nmana do not apply to the wider and what seems to be the earlier conception founid elsewhere. It is because this ftindamental question has been raised that I have dwelt on the euhemeristic aspect of the book. The author appears to admit certain exceptions to the ghostly origin of gods. It would be interesting to know definitely what excep- tions he does admit, and why, aud to what origin he attributes the exceptions. Every divinity he examines he resolves into a dead man. In ascribing, as I under- stand him to do, the origin of tragedy everywhere to the funeral and culltual rites of the dead, he is perilously near falling into the same error as that which explains every great figure as a vegetation demon or a sun-nyth. It is not my business here to take up the cudgels on behalf of his opponenits. They are quite able to defend themselves; and when they do we shall douibtless see some more sport. It is sufficient for me to say that in my view the day of a single all-embracing explana- tion of any of the great phenomena of human civilisation is over, and that gods and dramatic performances alike came into being in more ways than one ; the cult of the dead was only one of those ways. In any case Professor Ridgeway has written a brilliant and entertaining volume, which touches on the cults and dramatic dances of more peoples than it has beeni possible to refer to here. It is a volunme to be read and enjoyed, though its argumerits may not all be accepted. The appendix on the origin of Greek comedy is an acute and powerful examinationl of a very interesting historical question. The illulstratiolns, largely frnom photographs, throughout the book enhance its value. Some of them are very good. E. SIDNEY HARTLAND. [ 61 ]</page></plain_text>
