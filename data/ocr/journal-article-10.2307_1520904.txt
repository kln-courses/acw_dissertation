<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLONY AND NEST SITE SELECTION BY BLACK SKIMMERS Michael Gochfeld Field Research Center Rockefeller University Millbrook, New York 12545 Although the problem of habitat selection is probably a universal quest in behavioral ecology, it is a difficult problem to examine directly. This paper considers two aspects of habitat selection, the choice of colony and nest sites by colonial birds. I must emphasize that it is not clear how birds decide to remain at any one place for any period of time for any activity, nor is it obvious what factors interact to influence any particular decision. I have no doubt that such decisions, being important at all points in a bird's life, have been shaped by intense selection pressures. Yet one finds that some species are highly specific in their choice of habitat or nest site, while others---more opportunistic---appear to be very flexible. In fact, selection must act on these two general traits---plasticity or specificity---in much the same way as it molds any more specific character. I do not accept a priori that structural features of the habitat (vegetation, substrate, etc.) always play primary roles in determining where a bird nests, for other factors such as tradition or site tenacity and social interactions may exert important influences. Genetic and developmental factors may interact to influence habitat selection, with birds selecting the habitat in which they first saw light of day (i.e., habitat imprinting). It is not known whether this is characteristic of many species, nor what role it plays in those species in which it is manifest. Wecker (1963) found that prairie deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) may have their affinity for grassland reduced, but not reversed by early exposure to forests. Klopfer (1963) found that Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina) raised among oak leaves had a reduction in their normal preference for pine needles. These studies reveal that apparently innate habitat preferences can be modified by early experiences. Recently Noseworthy et al. (1973) found that after displacement young Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) returned to habitat similar to that in which they were hatched. D.B. Ford (pers. comm.) is investigating whether this preference extends to habitat selection when the birds return to breed as adults. This phenomenon deserves much more attention for a variety of species. One would predict that young chicks are not completely impressionable and will not develop preference for any habitat to which they are exposed. Rather there may be a restricted set of habitats to which they can form attachments. By analogy with models of bird song learning (see Marler 1976), birds could have an innate template which will allow them to imprint on a restricted set of the total spectrum of habitats. This would allow a species some plasticity in habitat selection, while guarding against an individual imprinting on a bizarre and inappropriate habitat. To complicate matters there is little information on what specific features of the habitat actually influence a bird. Nonetheless for most species we can readily characterize their preferred habitat. BLACK SKIMMERS This paper represents an initial effort to understand colony and nest site selection by Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger). Of the three species of skimmers, the Black Skimmer occurs over much of North and South America. The two southern races breed mainly along inland rivers of South America, while the North American race is apparently an exclusively coastal breeder. The South American subspecies breed mainly on sandbars along rivers, this habitat being very ephemeral, with many bars exposed for only a few months during the dry season, or appearing for only one or two years and then washing away. By contrast the barrier beaches on which the North American Black Skimmer nests tend to be somewhat more constant, though this is only a matter of degree. The species can be considered a relatively -78-</page><page sequence="2">fugitive species----one that must be able to constantly move its colony in response to change in the landscape. Although skimmers are abundant on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts from New York to Mexico, remarkably little has been published on their ecology and behavior. In literature published prior to 1950 the Black Skimmer is treated as a characteristic bird of barren sandy beaches or gravel bars, a habitat shared with Least Terns (Sterna albifrons) and Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus). Indeed, Audubon (1838) citing Bachman, reported a colony of about 10,000 skimmers nesting on a barren island off the Carolina coast. Although colonies of over 2000 pairs still occur on the Louisiana coast there are very few Atlantic coastal colonies which exceed 1000 pairs. Evidence presented in this papers shows that while skimmers do apparently prefer open habitats, they are actually remarkably tolerant of a wide range of habitats. On Long Island I have found them nesting among relatively dense vegetation on beaches and even on salt marshes. The main feature of these skimmer colonies has been the universal presence of Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) whose presence seems to be a requisite for a Black Skimmer colony. THE DECISION HIERARCHY I view nest site selection as the end result of a hierarchical process by which birds choose a particular colony site settle in a sub-unit of that colony, then stake out a territory in which they finally nest. 1) Colony selection: it is clear that habitat selection plays an important role when a colony is settled for the first time. Otherwise there is little evidence that habitat per se plays a role. Several colonial species show colony site tenacity. This tendency to return to a colony where one has bred previously increases the longer the site has been occupied (Austin 1949, Southern 1977). My experience with Common Terns and Black Skimmers on Long Island amply confirms this. Terns forced to move from a former colony site have a strong likelihood of joining an existing colony rather than pioneering at a new site. 2) Sub-colony selection: More than at any other stage, habitat plays a role in influencing how birds of different species distribute themselves within a mixed colony. Tradition may be important in some cases, but a dramatic exception occurred in 1977 at one colony I studied. The six clusters of Black Skimmers occupied areas which were mutually exclusive with sites that had been occupied the previous year. 3) Territory selection: The habitat available for ones territory is largely determined by overall habitat features of the section of the colony in which a bird has settled. At this stage the size and shape of territories are in part defined by density and by social interactions with ones' neighbors. The importance of vegetation and substrate characteristics for colonial birds remains to be determined. 4) Nest site selection: Within their territory pairs of skimmers engage in a mutual scrape making activity, and up to seven scrapes may be made within one territory. Ultimately one scrape becomes the nest, and it is uncertain whether the use of many scrapes plays an important role in nest site choice. The series of scrapes could afford the birds opportunity to judge the suitability of a particular spot with respect to substrate, vegetation, visibility, and proximity of neighbors. Burger (1974) demonstrated the role of visibility with respect to neighbors in influencing nest site selection by Franklyn's Gulls (Larus pipixican). Alternatively there may be no choice of decision; the nest may be chosen on the basis of the female simply laying, when she is ready, in whatever scrape is currently in use. The existence of a decision hierarchy is quite hypothetical. It helps one to think clearly about stages in the process of nest site selection, but it is not clear that the successive steps in the hierarchy are actually linked sequentially, or whether a bird actually makes any such decisions. For example, in the case of experienced birds that show nest site fidelity, they may simply return to the territory in which they formerly bred without actually making any decisions (in any meaningful sense) with respect to colony or sub-colony. -79-</page><page sequence="3">GENERAL PRINCIPLES A good rule for birds to follow is that they should return to a site in which they have bred successfully before and should abandon sites at which they can no longer breed with success. A corollary of this principle is that if a site has been occupied for few years then one or two seasons of failure should provide adequate evidence of its unsuitability. Sites with a long history of occupancy should not be abandoned "frivolously" after only one or two bad seasons. Young birds breeding for the first time should be able to locate a site at which experienced breeders are nesting or they should return to the site at which they were raised. A bird that decides to abandon a former site may move around evaluating habitats or may seek a location at which other birds are nesting, their occupancy providing some evidence of the new site's suitability. The latter is probably safer, yet a species ought to retain sufficient flexibility to do some pioneering on new and potentially productive sites. (The use of the anthropomorphic "ought" is intended to indicate traits which I predict will be selected for, rather than a personal value judgement). An important cautionary note is in order. In North America in the late 20th century, land along coasts is heavily in demand for residential, commercial, recreational use, and now for oil development as well. The extremely heavy competition from humans for coastal nesting sites has left most seabird species with a tenuous hold on a few fragments of their former range. Compensatory freedom from natural predation (such as foxes, weasels) has often been counterbalanced by intense rat and gull predation, not to mention human vandalism). Colonial seabirds are faced with intense pressure from humans, which includes constant diminution of available habitat. We have ample evidence that birds are being forced to nest in marginal habitats, such as low lying salt marsh islands, where they are rarely successful. There are relatively few colonies on natural sites along the Atlantic coast, most birds having begun nesting on artificial dredge spoil sites. Given all of these factors it is frustrating to attempt to unravel the habitat selection of seabirds since there is little evidence that the habitats available today are a fair sample of the habitat spectrum in which these species evolved. One must be extremely cautious in attempting to infer the evolutionary history of our bird species by studying them in habitats which offer little similarity to the past habitats of these birds. In attempts to conserve seabirds and provide them with suitable alternative habitats it is very important to understand features of their habitat selection. In some cases where colony sites now in use are threatened by development it is seductive to think in terms of providing alternative sites and hoping the birds will select and use them. I find this a poor alternative to preserving birds on colony sites they have already chosen. Such sites are proven to be good by the very fact that birds have chosen them. An important feature of their suitability lies in the birds themselves. It should be clear that with respect to colony selection the dependence on habitat features such as vegetation may be of only secondary importance. SITE TENACITY Site tenacity appears to be a real trait characteristic of many species. This trait (see brief review by McNicholl 1975) allows birds to return to proven locations. Species which nest in very unstable habitat like barrier beaches may still have strong site tenacity but must be able to override such tenacity when the former sites are no longer acceptable. Such species may indeed be fugitive species capable of shifting to new sites for every breeding season. Some fugitive behavior may arise not because of shifting habitats or sites but because of a need to avoid attracting predators. Skimmers nesting on ephemeral sand bars along the Amazon must be sufficiently opportunistic to discover and colonize new bars when they appear, but must abandon them when they are about to disappear. Preston (1962) provides a brief account of such a nesting. Common Terns provide good evidence for the general principles mentioned above, for they have strong site tenacity, a strong tendency to join existing colonies, and an ability to pioneer new sites when necessary (Austin 1949, Austin &amp; Austin 1956). -80-</page><page sequence="4">"Site tenacity" may be only a descriptive term indicating the average duration of residence by birds at a site. I consider, however, that it is a real trait of colonial birds. Such birds have high tenacity and such tenacity is probably equally strong in species of both stable and unstable habitats, and is equally capable of being modified in both types when the need arises. IMPORTANCE OF COMMON TERNS FOR NESTING SKIMMERS The Common Tern, although now abundant in the northeastern United States, was almost extirpated by intense hunting pressure for the millinery trade. It had disappeared from much of the Atlantic coast by the 1880's. Only when protective laws were enacted (see Ossa 1973 for details) did the species have a chance to recover. By the 1930's it was once again abundant in Massachusetts, although it has declined dramatically there in the past two decades (Nisbet 1973). There are currently at least 25,000 pairs of Common Terns along the Atlantic coast, but it is not numerous south of the Carolinas nor on the Gulf Coast. The Black Skimmer, unlike the terns, was not persecuted for feathers, nor was it hunted intensively for food (Stone 1932). Its population was not so drastically reduced, though it apparently disappeared from New Jersey about the time the terns did and did not reappear until after 1910 (Stone 1932). Along the Atlantic coast almost all nesting skimmers occur in Common Tern colonies (F.G. Buckley, M. Byrd, M. Erwin, J. Parnell pers. comm.). There are few excpetions. In 1977 F.G. and P.A. Buckley (pers. comm.) found three skimmers colonies of 400-450 pairs in southern New Jersey. Two of these had under 100 pairs of Common Terns and one had no Common Terns. These are unusual cases today, although formerly large aggregations of skimmers nested with few or no terns, much as they do today along the Gulf Coast. Reports of skimmers nesting on Cardwell Island, Virginia (Pettingill 1937) mention 400 to 1000+ skimmers nesting with no terns. This may be due in part to the fact that at that time the terns had not yet recovered substantially from the massacres of the 1800's. On Long Island I have examined 61 nestings of skimmers (a nesting being equivalent to a colony-year) and have found only one exception to the rule of skimmers associating with Common Terns. On John Boyle Island, Suffolk County, in 1976, the Buckley's and I found one pair of Black Skimmers nesting. The island held also one pair of Common Terns which nested about 150 m. away. The skimmers were not successful. Figure 1 shows the distribution of Black Skimmer and Common Tern colonies on Long Island in 1977. All skimmers nested in tern colonies, and most nested in large tern colonies. Thus 602 of the 654 nesting pairs (92%) occurred in five colonies which had 1000+ pairs of Common Terns. Conversely, only one large ternery, Great Gull Island, did not have any skimmers. This island, about 7 miles off the Long Island mainland is essentially pelagic. Moreover, there is very little sandy habitat appropriate for skimmers and the suitable sites are densely covered by nesting Common Terns. There is a positive and significant correlation (r = .91, p &lt;.001) between numbers of terns and numbers of skimmers in these sites. This is consistent with two hypotheses: a) terns and skimmers respond similarly to particular locations or habitats, or b) large aggregations of terns attract more skimmers than small groups. It is not a simple matter to determine whether the association between terns and skimmers is passive, arising from coincidental attraction to favorable areas, or whether there is positive social attraction of one species for the other. Indirectly, one can infer that the skimmers are attracted to the terns by the universal association of one with the other and by the fact that when terns move from one site to another the skimmers move with them, even thought the original site remains apparently unchanged. The reason for stating that it is terns that initiate the movements lies in the demonstration that in large colonies with far flung foci of nesting terns, a distant group may fail and begin the abandonment process; subsequently more and more terns may lose nests and depart and finally the skimmers will leave as well. -81-</page><page sequence="5">Several studies have reported certain species of larids and waterfowl which show strong preferences for nesting in or close to colonies of aggressive species of gulls and terns (e.g., Evans 1970, Koskimies 1957, Larson 1960). The more aggressive species mob predators to such an extent that they confer protection on their less aggressive associates. Kruuk (1964) and Lemmetyinen (1971) have demonstrated that such mobbing actually does deter predation. Such protection must adequately compensate for the predation that gulls visit on birds nesting near them or for the attacks that terns inflict on wandering chicks. Black Skimmers must be considered relatively non-aggressive, at least with respect to human intruders. During incubation they usually leave the nesting area when an intruder arrives and often settle outside the colony until the intruder leaves. Near hatching they frequently give distraction displays unlike almost all larids. During the chick phase the adults are more solicitous and may circle around or even closely approach the intruder while giving loud barking calls. It is extremely rare for a person to be actually struck by a skimmer. In approximately 20,000 visits to skimmer nests I have been struck only three times by adult skimmers. By contrast Common Terns, once they are habituated to humans will strike repeatedly. It is not uncommon to be struck 20 times per minute, and in a dense aggregation of terns the strike rate may easily exceed 40 times per minute. On 6 June 1975 I calculated that I was struck more than 10,000 times in one day by Common Terns at one New York colony. The vigorous nest defense by the terns may confer benefit on the skimmers that nest among them. In turn the nesting skimmers are themselves frequently subject to attacks. The skimmers remain remarkably tolerant, usually just ducking their heads as the terns swoop down and attack. Although it is difficult to evaluate the role of terns in protecting skimmers from natural predators in a region where natural predators have disappeared, there is evidence that there is protection against human intruders. It is apparent that Common Terns are an important feature of colony sites of skimmers on the Atlantic coast. Only where skimmers occur in sufficient numbers to form large monospecific aggregations or where terns are rare, does one find skimmers nesting without Common Terns. This evidence, derived from data on co-occurrence rather than from experimental habitat manipulations, should not be construed as evidence that skimmers do not show preference for certain habitats over others. Rather, within a given range of plausable habitats the presence of the terns is of overriding importance. PHENOLOGY Common Terns arrive on Long Island during the last two weeks of April, going immediately to traditional colony sites and remaining there unless these sites prove untenable. After about a week, flocks of skimmers appear in the tern colony, often as a single flock on a large open area with sparse vegetation. Terns appear to prefer the edges of vegetation. The skimmer flock may continually occupy one area in a colony or may fragment and occupy several of the more open parts of the colony. By the time laying occurs there may be several subgroups of skimmers, usually forming dense clusters surrounded by terns. It is not clear whether the skimmer occupancy of the open areas reflects their own habitat choice or whether they are filling lacunae left vacant by the terns, but both factors seem likely. Since we have not color-marked skimmers on Long Island on a large scale, it is not possible to determine whether these flocks of skimmers have consistent spatial structure, that is whether particular individuals consistently occur in the same position within the flock. The birds come and go as a flock, and although initially there is no evidence that the birds are paired, it soon becomes apparent that the birds have either paired quickly or that there is some separation of the flock into pairs. By examining the scrapes left in the sand after a flock has been flushed, it is apparent that although the flock continues to form a cohesive unit, there is a strong tendency for couples to form and remain close together. This makes it difficult to determine how territory establishment is accomplished, or whether it results passively, determined by the birds' position within the flock. The first skimmer eggs appear between 15 and 23 May on Long Island, and incubation takes about three weeks (20-23 days). The chicks, though capable of leaving the nest -82-</page><page sequence="6">within an hour of hatching, will remain near the nest for more than a week unless they are disturbed. Fledging occurs in the fifth week, and the skimmers then form a flock of adults and young which remains on the edge of the colony, in some cases for several months. When early nestings fail, re-nesting is the rule, and non-flying young have been seen on Long Island as late as 8 October, 1971 (D.B. Ford, pers. comm.). METHODS FOR STUDYING NEST SITE SELECTION I have approached the problem of nest site selection in two ways: 1) a descriptive or phenomenologic approach, treating the bird as a "black box" out of which a nest emerges (the nest site is described and compared with other sites), and 2) experimentally by manipulating the nest site or contents (allowing birds to "reconsider" their choice of nests. Since 1974 I have examined nests in several skimmer sub-colonies, measuring substrate and vegetation features, and making comparisons with tern nests, random points, and other points within the same 20 x 20 m. quadrat. I worked at West End Beach, Nassau County, New York and Cedar Beach, Suffolk County, New York (Gochfeld 1976). The colonies, located 10 miles apart, are on the barrier beach, and are within about 1 mile of Jones Inlet and Fire Island Inlet respectively. In recent years both colonies have had between 1800 and 3300 pairs of Common Terns and 50 to 200 pairs of Black Skimmers. The colonies were divided into 20 x 20 m. quadrats. Common Tern nests occurring in the same quadrats with skimmer nests were examined, as were small samples of nests occurring in quadrats where no skimmers were nesting. Random points were chosen either by 1) blindly throwing a surveyor's arrow into the quadrat, 2) by chosing a compass direction from 1 - 16 and a distance from 0 to 10 m. from a random number table (random polar coordinates) and 3) by choosing the x and y coordinates for points within a quadrat from random number tables (random rectangular coordinates). I also examined matched points located 2 m. east of skimmers nests in one sample. A final method, not yet analyzed, involves comparing skimmer nests with scrapes made within the territory but not used for nesting. 1. Substrate texture and moisture content: a) percent shell cover: I photographed each nest site using a 28 mm. wide angle lens positioned 1 m. above the nest, with a meter stick used to show the scale on one axis. Photographs were enlarged and placed on a digitizer tablet (Summagraphics) connected to a PDP-11-10 computer. I chose four sub-areas of the photo corresponding to 25 dm2 quadrats surrounding the nest scrape and for each measured the percent area covered by shells. This requires tracing the outline of the shells with a manual cursor. The tablet records the x and y coordinate of each point, and the area covered by shells was computed by a FORTRAN program written by Dr. Jeffrey Baylis. This method provides a precise measure of the shell cover, and the mean of the four subareas was used for comparison with visual estimates. I carried standardized photographs (on which the area had been computed) into the field as an aid in practicing visual estimates of shell cover. I was able to estimate the cover to 1% (in the range 0 - 5%), to 2% (from 6 - 10%), to 5% (from 10-25%), and to 15% (25-100%). These error limits were considered when I grouped my percent estimates for analysis. b) I also took four surface samples of sand and shell (1 cm deep and 2 x 2 cm in area) from points just beyond the nest rim. The texture profile of these samples was determined using a series of standard soil selves of the following sizes: .25, .5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm. c) Moisture content was obtained by weighing the above samples to the nearest 0.1 gm, then heating in a shallow pan to 250° C for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. The weight loss provided a measure of the water content. 2. Vegetation a) nearest objects: For each nest or point the nearest object rising 2 cm. or more above the surface was noted, and the distance from scrape edge to the object was measured. -83-</page><page sequence="7">FIGURE 1.

For each of these I estimated vegetation cover (with essentially the same error limits as for shell cover (see la above), by determining the number of dm2 squares covered by each kind of plant or other object (e.g., sticks, pieces of metal, old boots, etc.). Visual estimates were checked periodically using the digitizer tablet to precisely measure cover on photographs. The same four quadrat method was used to determine vegetation cover around random and matched points as well. RESULTS 1. Substrate comparison for shell cover: Table 1 gives results for four clusters of skimmer nests. At three of these there were no significant differences between skimmer nests, tern nests, or random points. In one cluster a Mann-Whitney Test showed significantly less shell cover (p &lt;.05) around skimmer nests vs. random points. In one other sample (see Table 2) skimmer nests had significantly more shell cover than tern nests (p &lt;.05). For 19 skimmer nests I found 3.4% shell cover, compared with 5.6% shell around matched points 2 m. east of each nest. The difference is marginally significant by Wilcoxin Signed Rank Test (p=.05), and supports the fruitfulness of such comparisons. 2. Soil moisture and texture: In one cluster I compared 16 skimmer nests, 11 tern nests and 31 random points. There were no significant differences between these samples, though both tern and skimmer nests had more coarse material (shell fragments) and also more very find sand, than the random samples which had a more equitable distribution of particle size between .25 and 2.0+ mm. These results are only preliminary. 3. Comparisons of objects nearest to nests: In one skimmer cluster (see Table 3) it is apparent that skimmers nested more often near short stubble of dead grass stems while terns preferred living grass, usually nesting around the edge of grass clumps. The difference between species was significant though neither was different from random points. 4. Vegetation cover: Table 2 shows that 42 skimmer nests averaged 3.2% cover in one cluster compared with 14.2% cover around 31 tern nests in the same quadrat (pC .001). Table 4 provides additional data on an area where skimmer nests had less cover than tern nests but the difference was not significant (p &gt;.20). Overall skimmer nests had less cover nearby than either tern nests or random points in the same cluster. EGG MANIPULATION STUDIES To evaluate skimmer choices between existing nest sites and sites to which eggs were displaced, I selected nests with four egg clutches known to be in the third week of incubation (14th-22 day). I displaced 1 or more eggs to a distance of 18" to the windward side, with the eggs aligned end to end with the long axis facing the nest. Birds were observed from a blind in some cases, and all nests were checked one hour after manipulation. The main result (Table 5) is that when only two eggs were displaced from the nest there was a strong tendency to retrieve the displaced eggs, while the new site (or another site other than the nest) was used in only 18 of 58 cases (31%). This figure rose to 19 of 55 (34.5%) when three eggs were displaced and 21 of 49 (43%) when four eggs were displaced. The birds that accepted new sites were all tested with only a single egg displaced and were found (in all but two cases) to retrieve eggs. The new sites were presumably considered acceptable nest sites, and these sites were described in the same manner as the actual nests for subsequent comparison with respect to soil texture, plant cover, nearest objects, and also slope. Skimmers did not accept sites that were on slopes (&gt; 10°) nor would they incubate eggs when they were very close to vegetation, but often they rolled the displaced eggs to a new site a few inches away, farther from the original nest scrape. -85-</page><page sequence="9">DISCUSSION Although it is traditional to compare behavior patterns observed with some kind of expected values generated by random events, this is often not interesting biologically. The fact that a set of data is consistent with random expectation is hardly evidence that the data arose due to random events. Consequently I have become impressed with the importance of comparing nest sites with matched points elsewhere in the territory or with previously used scrapes. These points probably represent choices that were actually available to the nesting birds after they had settled on the territory and it is clearly more realistic to make such comparisons than to use the random points. Throughout this paper I have discussed nest-site selection on sandy substrates. On sand I have found that skimmers are quite tolerant of a wide range of vegetation cover and types. Skimmers are even more tolerant, however. Frohling (1965) reported skimmers nesting on seawrack on a New Jersey salt marsh. Drs. J. Burger and M. Byrd (pers. comms.) report that this behavior is not uncommon in New Jersey and Virginia respectively. In 1977/ F.G. Buckley, P.A. Buckley and I found skimmers nesting on wrack on Lane's Island, Suffolk County, New York, among Common Terns. Chamberlain (1959) reported skimmers nesting on hard clay, while Preston (1962) mentions them laying on a tarpaulin on a ship after being subject to "egging" on a nearby sand bar. Such habitats, though not characteristic in any sense, indicate the range of tolerance of these birds. The experimental manipulations, although only preliminary results are reported here, raise questions about the uniqueness of the sites at which eggs are deposited, and provides alternative ways of approaching the problem of nest site selection. The time available does not permit discussion of additional features of the sub-colony sites used by the skimmers, nor comparisons between those 20 x 20 m. quadrats in which skimmers nested and those in which they did not nest. Moreover, the matter of loyalty of skimmers to colony, sub-colony, territory or nest site remains to be explored by recapturing banded adults or observing color-marked birds. That aspect of our project is still at an early stage, although we now know that skimmers begin breeding at two years of age and do have a strong tendency to return to the same colony in which they hatched.

Colony and nest site selection are two aspects of the more general problem of habitat selection and are difficult to study directly because the total spectrum of options available to an animal cannot be evaluated. 2. Tradition or site tenacity and social interactions may be more important than the physical features of a habitat in influencing the selection of colony sites. 3. Black Skimmers, though apparently preferring open unvegetated habitats, appear to require terns, particularly Common Terns, as nesting associates along the Atlantic coast of North America. Terns therefore should be considered an important feature of skimmer habitat selection. In order to nest with Common Terns, skimmers accept a wide variety of plant cover, including sea wrack on salt marshes. It is likely, though not proven, that terns confer benefit on skimmers by their aggressive anti-predator behavior. 4. Within tern colonies skimmers form more or less pure clusters. These clusters tend to occupy more open areas of the terneries, either representing skimmer preference or tern avoidance of areas with little vegetation. 5. Skimmer nest sites were compared with tern nests and random points with respect to substrate and vegetation quality. There was a strong correlation across sub-colonies between skimmer, tern, and random points with respect to vegetation cover. Skimmers averaged less cover than either terns or random points. 6. Although nest sites used by skimmers show some consistent features, the features may simply reflect the overall features of the sub-colony area in which the flock initially settles. The null-hypothesis that skimmers do not .actually select a nest site that differs consistently from other available sites, cannot be refuted with the data available thus far, although in some clusters the differences between skimmer nests and other sites was significant. It remains possible, though intellectually unsatisfying, that the birds merely make a series of scrapes as part of their display behavior, and, the one in which the female is sitting when she is ready to lay becomes the nest, though it may not differ appreciably from previously used scrapes in the same territory. 7. The technique of comparing nests with matched points within the colony and with early scrapes made prior to egg-laying, offers promise in evaluating the possible decisions made by nesting birds. 8. Egg-manipulation experiments provide nesting birds a choice between their familiar nest site (with or without eggs) and a new site (or sites) with one or more eggs. In the present study skimmers showed a high tendency to accept eggs in a new site, particularly when three or four eggs (of a four egg clutch) were displaced. The alternative sites, which would have been available to the birds at the time of initial laying, proved acceptable to the bird late in incubation. The significance of this finding and its utility in assessing the nest site selection process, must be elaborated. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I thank P.A. Buckley and F.G. Buckley for allowing and encouraging me to join them on their annual aerial survey of Long Island colonial birds. Diane Riska, Robert Gochfeld and Joy Grafton were major participants in the field study of nesting skimmers. Joanna Burger, Mitchell Byrd, Michael Erwin, Darrell Ford, and James Parnell provided information on the nesting of skimmers in various places. I thank J.R. Bayliss, without whose computer program, the adequate measurement of cover would have been most tedious. -87-</page><page sequence="11">TABLE 2 NEST SITE COMPARISONS FOR COMMON TERNS AND BLACK SKIMMERS AT WEST END BEACH, AREA 97, 1974 (see text ) Skimmer Tern Median Test results Nests Nests Mean % Plant Cover 3.2 14.2 X2=18, p&lt;.001 Mean % Shell Cover 10.5 6.5 X2=4.8 p &lt;.05 Sample size (nests) 42 31 TABLE 3 NEAREST OBJECT COMPARISONS FOR WEST END BEACH (WEST) IN 1975 N ST GE F Grd G Skimmer Nests 40 29 5 6 0 0 Tern Nests 28 8 11 3 4 2 Random Points 16 8 1 3 1 3 Combine GE+G and Grd+F for 3 x 3 contingency table analysi x2 = 11.33, df=4, .03 &gt; p &gt; .02.
