<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAIMONIDES IN ENGLISH CHRISTIAN THOUGHT AND SCHOLARSHIP: AN ALPHABETICAL SURVEY Jacob I. Dienstag New York City The influence of Maimonides on Christian occidental thought is one of the most interesting chapters in intellectual history. We are indebted to Manuel Joel1 and Jacob Guttmann2, who have broken ground in tracing the interrelationship between Jewish and Christian thought. In particular, the literature on the relationship of Albertus Magnus3 and St. Thomas Ac quinas4 to the philosophy of Maimonides has grown. In contrast to the documented bibliographical treatment of Christian Hebraism,3 no similar attempt has been made to sketch the influence of Maimonides in English Christian thought.6 This subject is of special interest to us because strong anti-Jewish attitudes prevailed among those English Rationalists who were averse to tradition.7 In connection with this, the image of the Jews and Judaism as portrayed by the English Deists of the eighteenth century is highly significant. Except for John Toland, all other prominent Deists regarded the Jews as barbarous, ignorant and cruel people. The bib lical characters were to them mere rogues or criminals and the Old Testa ment prophets narrow-minded bigots. "Consequently they belittled the spiritual achievements of the Jews and set Paganism above the Jewish reli gion."8 In focusing their attention on the author of The Guide of the Perplexed and the lucidly styled code, Mishneh Torah, Christian thinkers naively believed that Maimonides was unique among his co-religionists; that he was a dissident and really not in the Pharisaic tradition. Hence, he was often the object of "favorable" treatment by an otherwise prejudiced anti-Jewish intellectual establishment.9 In this survey, we have endeavored to gather within the available space a representative group of English thinkers, scholars, and men of letters reflect ing diverse cultural milieus. No attempt has been made at a conceptual anal ysis of the subjects discussed. This is beyond our scope. Each entry has been provided with a selected bibliography for the benefit of those who wish to explore the subject in greater scope. The chronological index will, we hope, reflect the evolution of English interest in Maimonides.* NOTES 'Manual Joel, "Etwas ueber den Einfluss der juedischen Philosophie auf die christliche Scholastik," MGWJ 9 (1860): 207-217, 284; reprinted in his Beitraege zur Geschichte der Philosophie (hereinafter cited as Beitraege), I.

Driven from England circa 1593 because of his adoption of the platform of the Independents, as repre sented by the Brownists (later called Congregationalists), he went to Amster dam. He served there as a teacher (1596-1610) in the Independent English Church and subsequently as its Minister. He partook with great zeal in the controversies of the day and wrote, for instance, A Defense of the Holy Scriptures against Smyth (and other works listed in the DNB, s.v.); but his great fame was acquired as a scholar of Hebrew, which he greatly perfected by association with Amsterdam Jews. The author of the metrical version of the Psalms in general was among the American pilgrims. Ainsworth was dubbed "the great Rabbi of his age" and a "Pilgrim Solomon." "A very learned man he was; we have heard some eminent in the knowledge of the tongue, of the University of Leyden, say that they thought he had not his better for the Hebrew tongue in the University, nor scarce in Europe." (Quoted by L. I. Newman, Jewish Influence on Christian Reform Move ments, p. 635, and I. S. Meyer-see bibl., ? p. 282). Ainsworth's Annotations to the Pentateuch, Psalms and, Canticles print ed after his death (and reprinted several times) is the most important of his works and of special concern here. In his preface to this work, Ainsworth praised Maimonides, whose Mishneh Torah summarized the laws "which the Rabbines did record and without whose help, many of those legal rites (especially in Exodus and Leviticus) will not be easily understood." Practi cally on every page of his Annotations he alludes to Maimonides' Mishneh Torah. In his notes on Gen 3:24 he cites the famous passage in H. Teshubah (VII, 2) in which Maimonides sets forth his eschatological views. Also, on IV, 26 he copied the first half chapter of Maimonides' Laws of Idolatry (Abodah Zarah I, 1-2). He again alludes in his note on the same verse to H. Yesode ha-Torah (III, 9) in which Maimonides discussed some cosmo logical points. On Gen 6:6, Ainsworth further alludes to H. Yesode ha-Torah I, 11-12, in which the anthropomorphic notions are rejected by Maimonides. References to and citations from the Mishneh Torah are also found in his annotations to Gen 6:7 (H. Tefilah; H. Rozeah II, 3; IX, 14, H. Berakot X, 16). In his comments on Jacob's ladder (Gen 28:12), Ainsworth cites Mai monides' interpretations of prophecy in dreams: The things made known to a prophet by prophetical vision were made known unto him by way of a parable; and immediately, the interpretation of the parable, was as written in his heart and he knew what it was. As the ladder which Jakob our father saw, and the Angels ascending and descending on it. And that was a parable of the (four) monarchies (Mishneh Torah, H. Yesode ha-Torah VII, 3). This aroused the ire of the Cambridge Platonist Bishop Simon PATRICK who noted dryly: "All this is the pure invention of the idle Men, who dream upon the Holy Scripture," (Commentary to Gen 28:12). Ainsworth's reliance upon the classical Hebrew commentaries to the Bible and continuous references to Maimonides' Mishneh Torah compelled him to come forth with an apology. He was following, he wrote, scholarly Chris tian expositors who made use of their works in the quest for a better under standing of the Hebrew Bible. Ainsworth described his method in his "An 251</page><page sequence="4">Advertisement to the Reader, touching on some objections made against the sincerity of the Hebrew text, and the allegations of the Rabbis in these former annotations" which follows his commentary. In referring to the Talmud, he described the role of the Mishneh Torah in its systematization and codification: These longsome volumes were after abridged by Moses sonne of Maim?n (called Mai mony, the Rambam) who lived 1,200 years after our Lord's birth, and he set down in plaine Hebrew, the expositions, canons and traditions according to which they had interpreted the Law of God given by Moses and practiced the same, omitting the dis courses, fables, disputes &amp; C. wherewith the Talmud is referred. And this Maim?n is of such esteems among Jewish nation, that of him it is said, From Moses (the Prophet) to Moses (son of Maim?n) there was none like this Moses. BIBL. C. A. Patrides.

ALEXANDER OF HALES (Hales, Gloucestershire, England, c. 1170-Paris, August21, 1245) Scholastic theologian. He was educated in the monastery at Hales, studied and lectured at Paris, and in 1222 he joined the Franciscan Order without renouncing (as was the custom) his teaching chair. The Summa Universae Theologiae traditionally ascribed to him was finished by Alexander's stu dents after his death. Although steadfast in his theological convictions, Alexander, in great contrast to the majority of his Christian contemporaries, professed considerable toleration for the Jews and other denominations. In his Summa Universae Theologiae he exhibits complete familiarity with the Latin translations of the Fountain of Life by R. Solomon Ibn Gabirol (thought then to be a non-Jew by the name "Avicebron") and the Guide of Maimonides. He adopted the characteristic attitude of Gabirol in reference to "spiritual substance," while he followed Maimonides in many details of biblical interpretation. We find only two allusions to the name "Rabbi Moyses" (Summa, L. 1, qu. 22, m. 6; cf. Guide, I, 72. The second reference to "Rabbi Moyses Judaeus" occurs in Summa, L. 3, qu. 28, m. 1, a.5; cf. Guide, III, 26), but it is evident that the Guide was the source of several features of Alexander's opinions, as was shown in the intensive studies on this subject by Jacob Guttmann (see bibl.). Alexander's demonstration that there is a knowledge of God per se and that, in addition to this independent knowledge, there is a cognition of God from His acts is undoubtedly taken from Maimonides. Referring to Ex 33:23, he explains that to apprehend God from His acts is to see Him "from behind;" whereas to recognize God's essence as it is, is to know Him "face to face" (Summa, book 1. ch. 2,1, art. 4; cf. Guide, I, 21, 38, 54). Alexander seems to have followed Maimonides both in his exposition of the proofs adduced by philosophers (i.e., the Peripatetic school) regarding 252</page><page sequence="5">the eternity of the world and in the refutation of the same (ibid., book 1, ch. 12, 8; cf. Guide, II, 14, 17, 18). The proposition that from the begin ning of creation the force necessary to produce not only natural but also supernatural things was inherent in the universe, and that consequently natural law was not broken by miracles, brings to mind other well-known passages of the Guide (Summa, book 2, ch. 42, 5, art. 5; cf. Guide, II, 29). Maimonides' explanation of the Mosaic legislation?which constitutes the chief contents of the third part of the Guide?seems to have produced as great an impression upon Alexander as it did upon the later scholastics. Beneath the ceremonial laws, he says, must lie a deeper spiritual meaning, since the passage, "This is your wisdom and your understanding in the yeres of the nation's" (Deut 4:6), cannot be construed to mean that on account of the mere strict observance of the law this people should be considered wise and intelligent (Summa, book 3, ch. 54, 2; cf., Guide, III, 31). His reference likewise to the origin of Jewish law, that all commandments were given to the Jews for the purpose of keeping them from idolatry, plainly indicates the influence of Maimonides (Summa, book 3, ch. 28, 2, art. 1; cf. Guide, III, 29), and the same is the case with his assertion that the sacri fices were designed after the spread of idolatry, to serve as protection against this aberration (Summa, book 3, ch. 58; cf. Guide, III, 46). Following the precedent of "Rabbi Moyses Judaeus," he distinguishes between "judicial laws" (Mishpatim), and "ceremonial laws" (Hukim), saying that the former are useful for Christian observance and the latter have a certain spiritual but not literal value for Christians (Summa, book 3, ch. 28, 1, art. 5; cf. Guide, III, 26). BIBL. J. Guttmann, Die Scholastik des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts (Breslau, 1902), 32-46; idem, Jewish Encyclopedia.

BERKELEY, GEORGE (Kilkenny, Ireland, Mar. 12, 1685 - Oxford, Jan. 14, 1753) Philosopher. He studied at Trinity College, Dublin, of which he became a fellow in 1707 and Doctor of Divinity in 1721. After some time spent in traveling abroad, he was appointed Dean of Derry in 1724. After failing in his scheme to establish a missionary college in Bermuda, for which he traveled to America in 1728, Berkeley returned to London in 1732. In 1734 he was made Bishop of Cloyne, a position he held until 1752, when he retired and settled in Oxford. Berkeley, who was a Lecturer in Hebrew in his College in 1723, began, from his early years, to develop an idealistic interpretation of reality and is celebrated for his metaphysical doctrine. Although Maimonides is not explicitly alluded to in his philosophical works, Berkeley's conception of angels echoes the Rabbi's discussion of this 253</page><page sequence="6">theme. Like Maimonides (Guide, II, 6; Pines translation, 262) Berkeley takes angels to be intelligences that are incorporeal and limited in power. Speaking through his character, Euphranor, in one of his dialogues, Alci phron, Berkeley reaffirms his view of a system of spirits referred to on other occasions (D?sir?e Park, Complimentary Notions, pp. 72-73), in remarking: And, for aught we know, this spot, with the few sinners on it, bears no greater pro portion to the universe of intelligences than a dungeon doth to a kingdom. It seems we are led not only by the revelation, but by common sense, observing and inferring from the analogy of visible things, to conclude there are innumerable orders of intelligent beings more happy and more perfect than man, whose life is but a span, and whose place, this earthly globe, is but a point, in respect of the whole system of God's crea tion...(G. Berkeley's Works, ed. A. A. Luce and T. E. Jessop, vol. Ill, p. 172) On another occasion he writes: Now both reason and Scripture assure us there are other spirits (as angels of different orders, etc.) besides man, who 'tis possible might have perceived this visible world according as it was successively exhibited to their views before man's creation (Letter to Lady Percival, Works, vol. VIII, pp. 37-38). Berkeley's conception of angels as spirits who are called "intelligences" and are characterized as those finite spirits that are the "natural forces" in the world is well supported by Maimonides: Now a chapter making it clear for us that the angels are not bodies occurs previously in the Treatise [Guide I, 49]. This is also what Aristotle says. But there is a difference in the terms; for he speaks of separate intellects, and we speak of angels. As of his saying that these separate intellects are also intermediaries between God, may He be exalted, and the existents; and that it is through their intermediation that the spheres are in motion, which motion is the cause of the generation of the things subject to generation; this too is the textual teaching of all the books. For you never find therein that an act was performed by God otherwise than through an angel. [and in the following paragraph] Now our discourse here shall deal only with the angels, who are separate intellects. For our Law does not deny the fact the He, may He be exalted, governs that which exists here through the intermediation of the angels {Guide, II, 6; Pines translation, p. 262). "Both Maimonides and Berkeley," writes Dr. Park, "significantly sub scribe to the concept of a God acting through the medium of angels in ruling the world"(/Wrf.,p. 76). The following closing passage of Maimonides' articulates his concept of angels, which recalls the Berkeleyan spirits: ...all these texts state plainly that all this including ? the various parts of that which exists and even the creation of the limbs of animals as they are ? has been brought about through the intermediation of angels. For all forces are angels (Guide, II, 6, Pines translation, p. 263; D. Park, ibid., p. 77). Maimonides' theory on Divine negative attributes in which he asserts that God is not corporeal (Guide, II, 56; Pines translation, p. 135) is reflected according to Dr. Park in Berkeley's positive concept of God as spirit (ibid., p. 85). The chapter in the Guide (I, 54) in which Maimonides shows that all the attributes communicated to Moses by God Himself were qualifications of actions, sheds, according to Dr. Park, light on Berkeley's remarks about Infinite Spirit (ibid., p. 86). Finally, Dr. Park assures us that "although Berkeley's library is not known 254</page><page sequence="7">to have contained a copy of the Guide...Archbishop Marsh's library included one, and that his collection was available to Berkeley at the time of writing the Siris. Moreover, the Sotheby's catalogue of Berkeley's library (com bined with those of his son and grandson) does include two copies of the De Sacrifiais [9th book of Mishneh Torah, translated into Latin by Ludo vicus de Compagne de Veil, London, 1683 and Amsterdam, 1701] and one of Maimonides' works on law. These could have been part of Berkeley's collection and probably were...Furthermore, the 17th century was a period in which learned divines drew freely on the works of Maimonides..." (ibid., P. 74).

BROUGHTON, HUGH (Oldbury, Shroopshire, England, 1549 - Tottenham, London, Aug. 4, 1612) Church of England scholar. Studied at Magdalene College (B.A. 1570); successively fellow of St. John's and Christ's colleges, Cambridge. In Lon don he gained fame as a preacher of Puritan doctrine, but he spent most of his life on the Continent, especially in Frankfurt and Amsterdam. His writ ings were collected by John LIGHTFOOT who also included a sketch of his life (The Works of..Hugh Broughton, London, 1662). Broughton trans lated into English Mishneh Torah, H, Melakhim (Kings), ch. XI in which Maimonides discusses the qualifications of King Messiah (Works, ibid., pp. 302-305). It is interesting to note that Broughton was unaware of the uncen sored edition of the Mishneh Torah which includes the section on Jesus and Mohammed. He also frequently refers to the Mishneh Torah in his An Ad vertisement of Corruption [Middelburg], 1604. We are a little puzzled by his remarks toward the end of this booklet of unnumbered leaves in which he speaks of one of the works of Maimonides "not yet printed, written upon the mysteries of the twelve Iewels" (6th leaf before the end).

Educated at Oxford and became Vicar of St. Thomas, Oxford. Subject to depression of spirit, he wrote as an antidote the singular book which has given him fame, The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621). Several times enlarged and revised before his death, this treatise encompasses a wide range of life and thought. Milton and other writers have been indebted to it, for Burton's "variety of learning...his pedantry sparkling with rude wit and shapeless elegance...have rendered it a repertory of amusement and information." In one place Burton refers to "Rabbi Moses' [Maimonides' Medical] Aphorism" (Anatomy of Learning, N.Y. 1937 and 1941, p. 368).

He was educated at Emanuel College, Cambridge. He soon gained a great reputa tion as a scholar and teacher, and became professor of Hebrew at Cam bridge (1645), where he remained till his death. Cudworth's principal work was The True Intellectual System of the Uni verse (1678) in which he occasionally refers to Maimonides' works: a.) In his discussion of the immortality of the soul, he quotes "the famous Maimonides...in his great work [Mishneh Torah, Teshubah, VIII, 2] that in the world to come, or state of consummate happiness, there shall be nothing at all of body, but pure incorporeality. Upon which account, being accused as a denier of the resurrection, (an article of the Jewish as well as of the Christian faith) he wrote that book entitled Iggereth Teman [!], purposely to purge himself, and to reconcile the two assertions together, which he doth after such a manner, as that there should be indeed a resurrection, at the first coming of the Jewish Messias, of some certain persons, to live here awhile upon the earth, eat and drink, marry and be given in marriage, and then die again; after which, in the world to come, they should for ever continue pure soul, un united to any body. In which it may be well suspected, that the design Maimonides drove at, was against Christianity; which, notwithstanding, as to this particular, hath the concurrent sufrages of the best philosophers..." (pp. 2-3). Cudworth, apparently, confused Maimonides' Treatise on Resurrection for the Epistle to Yemen, noted above. The edition of the Treatise on Resur rection he had most likely used was the one published in Amsterdam in 1660, which was printed as an appendix together with the Epistle to Yemen at the end of the Book of Divine Commandments. Neither the Epistle (leaves 122a 127b) nor the Treatise which follows it (leaves 128-131) have independent title pages, hence the confusion by Cudworth. (See Jacob I. Dienstag, The Epistle to Yemen, Aresheth, III (1961), 49, no. 3; ibid., Treatise on Resur rection, Kirjath Sepher4S (1973), p. 730, no. 3; both reprinted in J.I. Dien stag, ed.

CULVERWEL, NATHANIEL (England, c. 1615-ca. 1651) Cambridge Platonist. Little is known of his life. The dates and place of his birth and death are uncertain. He entered Emmanuel College, Cam bridge, in 1633 and received the B.A. degree in 1636, the M.A. in 1640, and was elected a fellow of his college in 1642. His chief work, Of the Light of Nature, a Discourse, was published with several smaller treatises in 1652 (latest edition, Edinburgh, 1857). The purpose of this book is to show the true relation between faith and reason. Despite his puritanism, Culverwel refers to the Scholastics and cites Mai monides' Guide of the Perplexed (p. 64). He makes use of Maimonides in his discussion of angelology and Shekhinah, of Divine Presence (p. 105). He finally alludes to him in his discussion of prophecy: Prophetical language is 'a mark of Divine communication' and doth necessarily require 'superhuman knowledge'; which makes me wonder at the great doctor Ben Maim?n, that resolves the power of prophesying into nothing else than a healthful temper, a lively complexion of body, and a vigorous mind advanced with study and industry...

He was educated at Oxford, and in 1912 took his D.D. degree at Bishop's College. He was made deacon in 1913 and was ordained as a priest the following year. From 1919 to 1936 Danby served as librarian and later as a canon of the Anglican Cathedral of St. George in Jerusalem. In 1936 he was appointed professor of Hebrew at Oxford.

DONNE, JOHN (London, 1573 - March 31,1631) Poet, theologian and controversialist, and Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Was educated both at Oxford and Cambridge Universities and was given a Catholic training at home. As early as 1592 he renounced the Roman Catholic faith, and in London in 1610 he published Pseudo Martyr, a treatise against Catholicism. He took Anglican orders in 1615 and preached sermons which rank among the best of the 17th century. From 1621 to his death he was Dean of St. Paul's and frequently preached before Charles I. Considered the finest poet of the so-called "metaphysical" school, it is the collection of his sermons which is of concern here. Donne, who devel oped into a superbly eloquent preacher, demonstrated an acquaintance with scholastic thought, both in his polemical writings and in his sermons. In one of his sermons, Donne alludes approvingly to Maimonides: "It is sufficiently expressed by Rabbi Moses, In Creatione Dicta sunt voluntates; In the act of Creation, the Will of God was the Word of God..." (Sermons, vol. IV, University of Claifornia Press, 1962, 102). Donne also leans on Maimonides on another occasion when he writes of him as "the saddest and soundest of the Hebrew Rabbins..." (ibid., vol. ix, 134); or: ...And howsoever he may seeme too tender and large herein, yet is it a good peece of counsaile, which that Rabbi whom I named before, Ne redarguas ea falsitatis, de quorum contrariti nulla est demonstratio. Be not apt to call any opinion false, or heretical, or damnable, the contrary whereof cannot be evidently proved...{ibid., vol. ix, 139). BIBL. J. K.

DUNS SCOTUS, JOHANNES (Maxton, near Roxbury, England, c. 1264 - Cologne, Nov. 8,1308) Theologian and foremost representative of the Franciscan Order. He may have studied at Oxford under WILLIAM OF WARE. He afterwards went to Paris to pursue his studies for the degree of bachelor, and soon after ward proceeded to that of doctor. He was a sharp critic of contemporary thought, especially of Thomism. Duns Scotus' severe attitude toward Jews and Judaism is displayed by his advocacy of forced baptism of Jewish children without their parents' permission. In fact, it is not only a privilege, but a duty to take children out of the power of their parents in case the latter are unwilling to bring them up as Christians. And not only the children, but also the parents themselves should be subjected to forcible baptism. 259</page><page sequence="12">Duns Scotus' acquaintance with Hebrew literature was confined to the Fons Vitae of R. Solomon Ibn Gabirol (also known as "Avicebron") and to the Guide of Maimonides. Like Thomas Aquinas, he follows the state ments of Maimonides concerning belief and knowledge or the relation of revelation and reason, which statements are all, in their essential points, traceable back to Saadia as their first source (Jacob Guttmann, Die Reli gionsphilosophie des Saadia, Goettingen, 1882, pp. 24-25; idem, Verhaelt niss des Thomas von Aquino, pp. 32ff.). Referring to Maimonides he says: The doctrine concerning the existence and freedom of God had to be imparted to the Israelites by means of revelation, although it may indeed be demonstrated by human reason. Such a revelation was necessary in view of the fact that the culture of the Israel ites was of an imperfect order, and also because they were inclined to idolatry (Sent. 1, dist. 2, qu. 3, 7, v. 294; compare Guide, II, 31). Altogether it cannot be helpful to a people that even truths accessible to reason should be authoritatively communicated to them; since there is a general indolence in regard to the discovery of truth, and the powers of comprehension of the average man are limited; and finally, for the reason that errors are apt to creep into speculations independently carried on, giving rise to doubts. Through an authoritative communication or revelation such a danger is ob viated. (Sent., ibid., p. 295; cp. Guide, I, 34). In connection with Aquinas' statements concerning the divine attributes, Duns discusses the view of Maimonides, which he finds to be in harmony with that of Avicenna, and which is to the effect that the attributes applicable to God either refer to his activity or else are of a negative character (Com mentary in Sent. 1, dist. 8, qu. 4, 2, Opera, v. 751; cf. Guide, I, 52, 53, et seq.). He cites Maimonides to the effect that God's activity is a necessity of his nature (Quaest. in metaphys., qu. 1, 13, ibid., IV, 513; cf. Guide, II, 21). The statement ? also traceable to Maimonides ? that there occur in the Bible designations that are applicable only to God is a view which the Jews held in regard to the Tetragrammaton (Comment, in Sent. 1dist. 22, qu. 1, 3, Opera, v. 1053; cf. Guide, I, 61). Duns Scotus follows Maimonides also in his treatment of the various forms of prophecy. The highest form of prophecy is, according to him, that in which the prophet not only grasps the revelation that comes to him but is also aware of its coming to him from God. Of this character was, for in stance, the intuition of Abraham, who would not have been ready to sacri fice his own son had he not been convinced that the command proceeded from God (Quest. Misceli., qu. 6, 3, Opera, III, 474; cf. Guide, 25). He ranges himself with Maimonides in his discussion of the number of the com mands enjoined in the Bible (In Sent. Ill, dist. 40, qu. unie. VII, p. 1031; cf. Guide, III, 31), and their division into ceremonial and legal injunctions (In Sent. IV, dist. 3, qu. 4; Report. Paris. IV, dist. 4, 15; cf. Guide, HI, 26). tion to Maimonides, whom he professes to follow (Report. Paris. II, dist. I, which he holds cannot be proved in the manner that Thomas Aquinas sets forth. In doing this he does not realize that he is putting himself in opposi tion Maimonides, whom he professes to follow (Report. Paris. II, dist. I, qu. 4; XI, p. 251). In his discussion of God's unity, Duns Scotus cites Maimonides not only as representative of this idea, but also as an authority ? ultimately rejected by Scotus ? who maintains the undemonstrability of God's unity (Opera Omnia, II, (Vatican City, 1950); Ordinatio I, d. II, q. 3; Philosophical Writ ings, edited by Alan Walter, p. 90). Seymour Feldman (see bibl.) has demon 260</page><page sequence="13">strated that Maimonides indeed produced his own proofs of God's unity, and he has also analyzed the causes of Duns Scotus' misinterpretation of this problem.

ESCHUID, JOHANNES (England, fl. 1350) Astrologer (also listed as Eschenden, Eschendon, Estwood, Eastwood). He probably hailed from Aschendon in Buckinghamshire. He was said to have become a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1338. His main work is an astrological compilation entitled Summa astrologiae iudicialis de accidentibus mundi, better known under the title Summa angli cana, which he completed in 1348. He was also the author of many prog nostications based on eclipses and conjunctions. He neglected the art of interrogations and horoscopes, and made a special study of eclipses and conjunctions of the planets and their influence on great catastrophies such as earthquakes, floods, plagues, famines, wars, and conflagrations. Eschuid's Summa cites a great number of ancient and medieval authori ties with accurate references to them. Thus in the first chapter on the begin ning of the world he cites Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed (Oriel 23, fol. or, "Rabymoyes vero de duce dubiarum c 181 dicit" as quoted by Thorn dike-see bibl.-p. 330). His influence continued to grow for several centuries and Eschuid could still be spoken of at the end of the seventeenth century as one of the greatest scientists of England (G. Sarton-see bibl.-vol. 3, p. 249). BIBL. Lynn Thorndike, A History of Magic and Experimental Science 3 (1934), 325-346; G. Sarton, Introduction to the History of Science, 3 (1947), 672-673; A. B.

GROSSETESTE, ROBERT (Suffolk, c. 1175 - Huntingdonshire, Oct. 9, 1253) Bishop of Lincoln. Educated in Oxford and possibly at Paris. Early in the 13th century he came to Oxford as a teacher; first lecturer to the Oxford Franciscans and first chancellor of the University of Oxford. He was bishop of Lincoln from 1235 to his death in 1253. Grossetestes' interests covered a very wide range of learned studies including astronomy, mathematics, op tics, and other scientific subjects, and he translated the works of Aristotle and others from the Greek into Latin. His influence was strongly felt in England for at least a couple of centuries and he was the forerunner of his most famous pupil, Roger Bacon. The main source containing Grosseteste's scientific writings is Ludwig Bauer's Die Philosophischen Werke des Robert Grosseteste, which was published in Beitraege zur Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters, vol. 9 (Munster i.W., 1912). This critical edition includes 29 works, authentic and apocryphal. Among the works of concern to us is the Summa Philosophiae in which allusions to The Guide of the Perplexed occur frequently. It is, however, wrongly ascribed to Grosseteste. Perhaps it was written by his pu pil, Roger Bacon, or one of his disciples. The views expressed therein, how ever, do agree with the doctrine of the bishop of Lincoln. The reason for this is that the philosophical positions it represents are practically common to all his contemporaries, except, naturally, Thomas Aquinas (E. Gilson, History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle Ages, p. 265). Gilson writes: Whoever the author and whatever its true origin may have been, this work expresses with remarkable clarity the reaction of a representative of the early Oxonian tradition against the novelties introduced into theology by St. Thomas Aquinas. The traditional character of its inspiration explains its attribution to R. Grosseteste, but its historical setting belongs in the second half of the thirteenth century, about the year 1270 or even later on... (Gilson, ibid., p. 274). The Summa Philosophiae is packed with Hebraeo-Arabic elements and contains a history of philosophy in which is included a very interesting list of those whom the author regarded as modern thinkers, ending with Mai monides. The following random references and allusions to Maimonides in the Summa Philosophiae are based upon the edition of Bauer noted above. The pagination is followed by line references within a parenthesis: 286 (15): The author refers to Maimonides' interpretation of the obscure phraseology of the vision of Ezekiel in which are contained allusions to the subject of metaphysics concerning God, the Separate Intelligences and the celestial spheres in the first chapter of that prophet's book. 342 (39): Maimonides is again referred to on the influence of the heavenly spheres. 589 (9); 594 (10); 599 (15); 532 (36); 517 (20); 552 (15); 584 (1); 612 (23); 615 (16): An allusion to the rotation of the whole celestial sphere as described in the Guide (I, 72): Inasmuch as the fifth body as a whole is engaged perpetually in a circular motion, it thus engenders forced motion in the elements because of which they leave their places. 262</page><page sequence="15">I have in view fire and air, which are pushing toward the water. All of them penetrate toward the body of the earth, in the valleys. In consequence a mixture of the elements comes about. (Pines translation, p. 186 ff.). The author also alludes to the imagery paralleling the universe and man: And just as in the body of man there are ruling parts and ruled parts requiring for their continued existence the governance of the ruling part governing them, so are there in the world as a whole ruling parts ? namely, the fifth encompassing body ? and ruled parts requiring a governor ? they are the elements and what is composed of them. And just as the ruling part, which is the heart, is always in motion and is the principle of every motion to be found in the body, whereas the other parts of the body are ruled by the heart, which in virtue of its motion sends towards them the forces they require for their functions; so heaven in virtue of its motion exerts governance over the other parts of the world and sends to every generated thing the forces that subsist in the latter. Accordingly, every motion existing in the world has as its first principle the motion of heaven, and every soul existing in the beings endowed with souls that are in the world has as its principle the soul of heaven. Know that, as has been made clear, that the forces come from heaven to this world are four {ibid., Pines translation, 186-187). 409 (40); 410 (17): The author disagrees with Maimonides' critique of Aristotle about his theory of the eternity of the universe. He refers to the following in the Guide, II, 15: My purpose in this chapter is to make it clear that Aristotle possesses no demonstration for the world being eternal, as he understands this. Moreover he is not mistaken with regard to this. I mean to say that he himself knows that he possesses no demonstration with regard to this point, and that the arguments and the proofs that he sets forth are merely such as occur to the mind and to which the soul inclines. (Pines translation, p. 289). 412 (3): Maimonides is a source to our author for Aristotle's thinking that God's providence ends at the sphere of the moon (Guide, III, 17; Pines translation, p. 465). 432 (28); 561 (23): The author leans on Maimonides' view that the science of mathematics had not been perfected in Aristotle's time (Guide, II, 19, 24; Pines translation, pp. 307-308, 326). 581 (15): Finally, the author alludes to Maimonides' laudatory statement on Aristotle (Guide, II, 22): Everything that Aristotle has said about all that exists from beneath the sphere of the moon to the center of the earth is indubitably correct, and no one will deviate from it unless he does not understand it or unless he has preconceived opinions that he wishes to defend or that lead him to a denial of a thing that is manifest (Pines translation, p. 319; cf.

HARRINGTON, JAMES (Upton, Northampshire, Jan. 7, 1611 - Westminster, London, Sept. 11, 1677) English political philosopher. An erudite man, Harrington must have acquired his great knowledge of languages, literature and history largely independently since he spent only two or three years at Oxford and in the Middle Temple and took no degrees. During the 1630's he traveled exten sively on the continent. From these experiences, and especially from a visit to Venice, Harrington gathered much of the data which later formed the raw material for his political theory. His Commonwealth of Oceana (1656; 1771) was a picture of a Utopian society based on a sort of patrician agrarianism and the ballot. He extended the elective principle and believed in the division of powers of government. He also advocated the written constitution. Harrington, in his political philosophy, draws heavily on the Bible and other Hebrew sources among which is Maimonides. In his discussion of the succession of power and popular government, he refers, for instance, to the Code, the Mishneh Torah, H. Sanh?drin (ch. IV) in which Maimonides formulates the laws of ordination of judges; how, by whom and where this power is to be conferred. (The Oceana and other Works, London, 1771, p. 328,331-332). BIBL.

HEY, JOHN (England, July 1734 - London, Mar. 17, 1815) Theologian. Educated in Cambridge, became a fellow of Sidney Sussex College in 1758, and was tutor from 1760 to 1779. His lectures on morality were admired and were attended by William Pitt. In 1780 he was elected to the Norrisian Professorship of Divinity, of which he was the first holder. He was re-elected in 1785 and in 1790. Hey's Lectures on Divinity, first pub lished in 17% in four volumes, were reprinted in 1822 and 1841. In his ration alism, he endeavoured to reduce as much as possible the difference between the Church of England and the Unitarians. Hey was acquainted with both major works of Maimonides, the Mishneh Torah and Guide to the Perplexed. In his description of the allegorical inter pretation of the biblical text, he alludes to the Guide (III, 43) in which Mai 264</page><page sequence="17">monides expounds the style of the Midrash (Lectures on Divinity, I, 259 260). In his discussion of Original Sin, Hey cites Mishneh Torah, H. Teshu vah, V, that it "was a thing impossible" (Lectures on Divinity, III, 137). He again alludes to H. Teshuvah (V, 2) when he cites Maimonides' formulation of free will: "That every man has it in his power to turn himself into a good way, and to be just, righteous." (/??/tf., p. 197,490). BIBL. DNB, s.v.; Page references are to the 1822 ed. of Hey's Lectures. HYDE, THOMAS (Billingsley, Shropshire, England, June 29, 1636-Feb. 18, 1703) Orientalist. Studied Oriental languages under his father, and in his six teenth year entered King's College, Cambridge. A year later he was invited to London to assist Brian Walton on his Polyglot. In 1658 he entered Queen's College, Oxford (M.A. 1659, D.D. 1682), where, in the same year, he became reader in Hebrew. In 1659 he was appointed under-keeper of the Bodleian Library and from 1665 to 1701 he was librarian-in-chief. He became Laudian Professor of Arabic at Oxford and canon of Christ Church in 1697. His printed specimen of a proposed edition of the Guide for the Perplexed is dated "Dec. 10, 1690" by the Clarendon Press official: Proponitur Maimonidis More Nevochim typis mandandum lingua arabica, qua ab authore primo scriptum est Oxford, 1690. 2 leaves. 4?; reprinted under the title "Speci men Maimonides More Nevochim Arabice et latine, cum notis" in his "Syntagma Dis sertationum" (ed., G. Sharpe), vol. II. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1767, pp. 433-438. Through lack of sufficient encouragement Hyde was compelled to aban don the project. The following is an English translation of the Latin prospectus by the Rev. S. Levy: Proposals for an edition of Maimonides' More Nevochim, to be printed in the Arabic tongue, in which it was first written by the author. Reasons for undertaking the task: 1. The Latin edition of Buxtorfius has many years ago been dispersed and exhausted, so that this book, invaluable for the exegesis of Holy Scripture, cannot be purchased today at any price. 2. Although the Latin version of the distinguished Buxtorfius, supposing it could be procured, is for the most part accurate, it is in places too free, and in places the idioms of the Hebrew tongue have led the learned gentleman into error, since the original Arabic text was not there to be consulted. Since therefore we have up till now received the teaching of the aforesaid book only at third hand, and that somewhat imperfectly, if it is the wish of patrons of good liter ature, let Maimonides be heard speaking in his own Arabic words in an edition to be published on the following lines: ? viz. 1. Original Arabic Text to be transcribed from the Hebrew script in which it was written by Maimonides to true Arabic script, and published in Arabic characters. 2. Accurate Latin translation to face Arabic Text. 3. At the foot of each page some necessary notes to be added having regard as much to the Arabic text as to the translation into Hebrew as occasion demands. 265</page><page sequence="18">But if it be judged that these notes would cause the work to grow to excessive bulk, let these be omitted, and the plain Arabic and Latin text be published. The decision on this point must rest with the promoters of the work. BIBL. Dictionary of National Biography, s.v.; New Schaff-Herzog En cyclopedia, vol. V, p. 423; S.

After completing his education at Christ's College, Cambridge, he was, from 1630 to 1642, rector of Ashley, Staffs. In 1643 Lightfoot became one of the original and more influential members of the Westminster Assembly. From 1650 until his death, Lightfoot was master of St. Catherine Hall, Cambridge. He was parliamentarian and sided with the Presbyterians in the Savoy Conference of 1661, but accepted the Act of Uniformity in the following year. Lightfoot developed an early interest in Hebrew and talmudic studies. He was a prolific author and was the first Christian scholar to call attention to the importance of the Talmud for the interpretation of the New Testament. His best known work is the series of Horae Hebraicae et Talmudicae (6 vols., 1658-78). In it Lightfoot showed a considerable acquaintance with Talmud and Midrash, greater perhaps than any non-Jew has shown before the pres ent day. C.E. Schertzer (see bibl.) has shown that: Lightfoot constantly supplemented and complemented his knowledge to the Talmud with the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides whom he called 'the great registrar of the Jews customs and antiquities.' Both in breadth and style, Maimonides could well im press the Christian as the final authority on allmatters Jewish (p. 60). He also relied upon the Mishneh Torah to describe Jewish ritual and legislation....This reliance upon him [Maimonides] was so complete that Lightfoot never referred to the codes of law which superceded the Mishneh Torah...Lightfoot in all probability considered the Mishneh Torah definite and closer to the historical period of the time of Jesus, than the later codes. He was interested in the nature of the Jewish religion in the time of the Gospels, not in the later development of Jewish law. Lightfoot thus again displayed his uncritical approach to Jewish sources. He turned Maimonides into a discipline of the first rather than the 12th century, who had first-hand knowledge of the milieu in which Jesus lived (pp. 63-64). Schertzer also pointed out that: the almost complete reliance upon Maimonides as the arbiter of Jewish law and ritual and the deceptive clarity and simplicity of his style and language at times caused a seasoned Hebraist like Lightfoot to inadvertently make facile, but very grievous blun ders. [This] caused [him] to distort the nature and sequence of the Passover meal and in turn undermined his analysis of the behavior of Jesus during the Last Supper (pp. 64-65). 266</page><page sequence="19">In his description of the Last Supper, Schertzer notes, Lightfoot attempted to root every incident recorded in the Gospels in Jewish Custom. That we might more clearly perceive the history of this supper in the evangelists, it may not be amiss to transcribe the rubric of the Paschal supper, with what brevity we can, out of the Talmudists; that we may compare the things, here related, with the custom of the nation... (The Whole Works, vol. XI, p. 329; Schertzer, pp. 199-200). Schertzer continues: "Using primarily the Mishnah and Mishneh Torah of Maimonides, [Lightfoot] offered a portrayal of the Last Supper which rudely jarred the traditional Christian understanding." He thus insisted that Jesus and his disciples did not merely sit at the table as indicated by Matt. 21:20, but to conform with tradition were actually "lying at the table... because it carried with it...a signification of liberty." (Works XI, pp. 327 328; Schertzer, p. 200). BIBL. CE. Schertzer, Christian Hebraism in the 17th Century England as Reflected in the Works of John Lightfoot (New York, 1977). Diss.

To our inquiry, the Bodleian Library wrote that they, too, could not verify this work.

I-V, 1896-1901). It is then what we call in bibliographical parlance a "Ghost." BIBL. M. Steinschneider, Catalogus Libr. Hebr. in Bibl. Bodleiana, col. 1625, no. 6169. LIVELY, EDWARD (England, 1545? -1605) Hebrew professor at Cambridge, England. Studied at Cambridge Univer sity where he later taught. During his residence at the university he received instruction in Hebrew from the famous John Drusius. About 1575 he was unanimously elected regius professor of Hebrew, an office he held until his death. Lively was one of the fifty-four learned men appointed by King James in 1604 to make the Authorized' translation of the Bible. A skillful contro versialist, Lively participated in the struggle of the Protestants against the Church of Rome, while busily engaged in his linguistic and historical chronological elucidation of the Hebrew Bible, and studies on Hebrew grammar and chronology, most of which remain in manuscript. One work by Lively, the Chronologia seu Notitia Temporum (MS. nr. 126, Trinity College, Dublin, Quarto, 256 pp.) is of concern here for it 267</page><page sequence="20">refers frequently to Jewish scholars, especially to Maimonides. The work, according to E.I. J. Rosenthal (see bibl.), is a mixture of calendar, chrono logical tables and chronicle. Maimonides ' Mishneh Tora h is repeatedly cited, giving chapter references, quoting the Hebrew text followed by an exact Latin translation (Rosenthal, p. 159). Lively discusses the occurrence of Pentecost in relation to Passover, mentions the counting of the Omer', and shows a good knowledge of Jewish feast days, of their appropriate sacri fices at the appropriate times, and of the Jewish liturgy, drawing support for his views from the Jewish classical sources, both ancient and medieval. In his discussion of the various aspects of the Jewish calendar, such as Molad and 'Ibbur, Shemittah (Sabbatical Year) and Jubilee, he leans heavily on Maimonides' Hilkot Yovel, chapter X and even cites R. Joseph Caro's inter pretation of Maimonides' meaning, printed in the margin of the Mishneh Torah as confirmation (Rosenthal, ibid.). By virtue of his erudition in the Jewish sources, he succeeded in refuting the attacks upon the veracity of the Rabbis of the Talmud, and thus established his competence in the skill ful application of rabbinic texts in a way not witnessed in sixteenth century Hebraism. He was, indeed, the forerunner of such English Hebraists as J. LIGHTFOOT and E. POCOCKE (Rosenthal, p. 160). BIBL. Erwin I.J.

LOWMAN, MOSES (London, 1680 - May 2, 1752) Dissenting theologian. Became a student at the Middle Temple in 1697, but a year later abandoned law for divinity. In 1698 he entered the Univer sity of Leiden and studied theology at Utrecht. In 1710 he became assistant to Mr. Grace, Presbyterian minister at Clapham, but from 1714 until his death acted as Chief Minister of the congregation. In 1733 he published a polemical tract against Collins, the deist, which was praised by Leland. But his reputation rests on his works dealing with Jewish antiquities, of which only two will be discussed here: 1) A Dissertation on the Civil Government of the Hebrews (London, 1740), written in answer to Morgan's Moral Philosopher. Lowman refers to the reasons for the Divine Commandments, expounded by Maimonides in the Guide to the Perplexed. He alludes, for instance, to the biblical prohibition against men and women interchanging their wearing apparel (Deut 22:5), and he quotes (p. 19) Maimonides' reason that this custom was connected with idol-worship (Guide, III, 37). He again alludes to the Guide (I, 37) in describing the nature of revelation from God to Moses, that it was the peculiar privilege of Moses that God spoke to him face to face (p. 149, note). 2) A Rational of the Ritual of the Hebrew Worship; in which the Wise Desighns and Usefulness of the Ritual are explained and vindicated from objections (London, 1748). At the outset of this work, Lowman seeks to apply the "principles of true religion stated by Herbert Cherbury" to the 268</page><page sequence="21">Mosaic in order to show "their real virtue and worth," but in fact goes back to Maimonides, whom he calls "the most learned and judicious Hebrew doctor" (p. 3; see also below). He then quotes the Guide, in which Maimoni des formulates his approach to the reasons for the Divine Commandments which promote the well-being of man by teaching truth, morality and social conduct (Guide, III, 31). In his discussion of the history and nature of idol atry in ancient times (p. 40), he again leans on Maimonides' exposition of the Sabeans and their rites (Guide, III, 29). Lowman, like J. SPENCER before him, who laid the foundations of the science of Comparative Religion by following Maimonides' explanations of the Divine Commandments, continuously alludes to the Guide on this subject (ibid., p. 54,182,230, 232, 240; cf. Guide, III, 37, 46). In his attempt to expound the concept of Shek hinah, the majestic presence of manifestation of God, Lowman prefaces his remarks by turning to Maimonides: Before we examine what was the particular Symbol of this Presence..., it will be proper, to consider the general meaning of Shekhinah, in which the Hebrew Masters will afford us some Light. Maimonides has a particular Chapter on this Expression, Schechinah. Lowman then proceeds to cite (pp. 75-76) more than half of that chapter in the Guide (I, 25). "This learned Master," Lowman then continues, "ex plains his meaning more fully in another place" (ibid., p. 76) and continues to cite the Guide (1,19). In his discussion of angels and the Cherubim, Low man again turns to Maimonides ("the most judicious of the Hebrew Mas ters") from whose Guide (III, 46) he cites most profusely (ibid., pp. 104-105). Lowman had diligently studied Maimonides' Ten Precepts enumerated in H. Yesode ha-Torah (I, 1) which opens the first book of the Mishneh Torah, Book of Knowledge and the Thirteen Articles of Faith which are expounded in his Commentary to the Mishneh (Introduction to Sanh?drin, chapter X). He is struck by the similarity of these tenets to Lord Edward Herbert's deistic five fundamental religious notions common to all mankind: 1) "That there is a Supreme Power"; 2) "That this Sovereign Power must be wor shipped"; 3) "That the good ordering or disposition of the faculties of man constitutes the principal or best part of divine worship, and that this has always been believed"; 4) "That all vices and crimes should be expiated and effaced by repentance"; and 5) "That there are rewards and punish ments after this life." "This creed of the Hebrew Church," Lowman as serts, "...takes in all things which Lord Herbert makes essential to true Reli gion, either to the honorable Worship of God, or to the Perfection and Hap piness of the Worshipper..." (A Rational of the Ritual of Hebrew Worship, pp. 264-299). BIBL. DNB, s.v.; The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Lit. (ed. G. Watson), II (Cambridge University Press, 1971), 1673-4. MILTON, JOHN (London, Dec. 9,1608 - Nov. 8,1674) English Puritan poet and controversialist. Born in a period when a great moral change passed over England during the years which parted the middle of the reign of Elizabeth from the meeting of the Long Parliament. Milton, like the rest of his coreligionists, found his inspiration in the Bible. In fact, 269</page><page sequence="22">he began his career as a poet by translating Psalms, and echoes of their lan guage are to be found in all his writings. His knowledge of Hebrew and Aramaic has been a subject of study during the last fifty years. Undoubtedly, his knowledge was sufficient to enable him to read the Hebrew Bible and its classical Hebrew commentaries. During a critical period of his life, when his wife, Mary Powell, left him the same year they were married (1643), Milton, who was prevented by ecclesiastical law from divorcing her, did not hesitate to turn to Maimonides for theological sup port. It was through The Guide for the Perplexed that he attempted to find a religious sanction for dissolving his marriage: "Hence it is that the Rabbis and Maimonides, famous among the rest, in a book of his...tells us that divorce was permitted to Moses to preserve peace and quiet in the family." (The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, chap. VI; Works of John Milton, vol. Ill, part 2, New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 402-403; cf. Guide, III, 49). Students of Milton's Paradise Lost find some themes in this poem which are in accord with Jewish tradition and later Jewish writings. The idea that Satan's motive in seducing Eve was lust aroused in him by envy of Adam's marital relations is a common one in post-biblical writings. Though Mai monides does not mention Satan's adulteration of the fruit, he does say, "when the Serpent came to Eve, he infected her with his poison" (Guide, II, 30; cf. Paradise Lost, II, 357 ff., 501; IV. 337ff.). Another instance is his mention of the Jewish tradition of the bisexual nature of Adam. According to this outlook, Adam was created androgynously, with two faces, and was subsequently separated into man and woman. This tradition, which is found in the Midrash, is alluded to by Maimonides: "Adam and Eve were at first created as one being, having their backs united; they were then separated, and one half was removed and brought before Adam as Eve" (Guide, II, 30). This, Milton refers to contemptuously as an example of "Jewish fabling," (Tetrachordon; Works, vol. IV, p. 76) and makes no use of it in the Epic, though there are some traces of its influence in the expressed idea that man without woman is an incomplete being. Thus Adam explains to Raphael his own uxoriousness: Or Nature failed in me, and left some part Not proof enough such object to sustain, Or from my side subducting, took perhaps More than enough... {ParadiseLost, VIII, 534; Works, II, 254). A leading motif in Milton's Paradise Lost, namely, the Fall of Adam is, according to Teicher (see bibl.), directly derived from the Guide of the Per plexed: Milton conceives Adam's fall, not in the usual Christian manner as a lapse from the state of innocence to the knowledge of sin, but, like Maimonides in chapter 2 of the first book of [the Guide], as the overpowering of reason by passion: Reason in Man obscur'd, or not obey'd, Immediately inordinate desires And upstart passion catch the government From Reason... (ParadiseLost, XII, 86-9; Works, II, 381). That Milton was familiar with Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed can be verified, for he mentions it in his controversy with Salmasius (Defense of the English People; Works, vol. VII, p. 103). He also mentions Buxtorf 270</page><page sequence="23">as the editor and translator of the Guide into Latin (Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce; Works, vol. Ill, part 2, pp. 402-403). BIBL. H.F.

In the preface to my "Christian Translators of Maimonides' Mish neh Torah into Latin," Salo W. Baron Jubilee Volume, 1(1974), p. 288, I erroneously referred to Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, H. Gerushin instead of to his Guide for the Perplexed, to which Milton turned for the theologi cal support during his pleading for more liberal divorce laws. MIRK, JOHN (England, c. 1400) Religious writer and preacher. Beyond the fact that he was the prior of the Canons Regular of Lilleshall in Shropshire, nothing is known of his life. One of his surviving writings is the Liber Festialis, a kind of model sermonbook, containing seventy-four sermons written in simple and easy prose. These sermons were intended to constitute a complete cycle for the higher festivals of the Christian year. It is in this work that we find a reference to an astronomical estimate of the dimensions and distances of the spheres and the stars as noted in the Guide (III, 14): And thus said a great philosopher, Rabbi Moses that it is as far from earth to heaven as a holy man might live a thousand years and each day go a thousand miles (Mirk's Festial, ed. Th. Erbe, Part I, London, 1905, p. 152; free translation, from Old English by my late esteemed colleague Professor Irving Linn [Jan. 24, 1912 - Oct. 5, 1977]). This curious estimate of "astronomical" distance reflects a crude attempt to impress the lay mind with the vastness of the universe to which it belongs (G.R. Owst, see bibl.). 271</page><page sequence="24">BIBL. Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (ed., F.L. Cross), s.v.; DNB, s.v.; G.P.

MORE, HENRY (Grantham, Lincolnshire, 1614-Cambridge, Sept. 1,1687) Cambridge Platonist and one of its distinguished members. Educated at Eton and Christ's College, Cambridge. He entered Christ's in December 1631, six months before MILTON left. More made his home there throughout his life, despite the fact that he was offered several rich preferments. His chief interests were theological and philosophical, in his words: "The knowledge of natural and divine things seemed to me the highest pleasure and felicity imagineable." He shunned public and political involvement including the Civil War, Commonwealth and Restoration. But he was keenly interested in all that concerned the life of the mind, and followed closely the theological discussions as well as the scientific investigations. Aiming towards a spiritual view of the world as a whole, More sought in his writings to vindicate theism and immortality against the materialism represented by T. Hobbes. According to More there is "A certain principle more noble and inward than reason itself, and without which reason will falter or at least reach but to mean and frivolous things." He calls this principle, Divine Sagacity, a sort of intuitive insight. Among his many works is the Conjectura Cabbalistica (1653). The title is misleading, for More lavishly employs the terms without offering a single quotation from cabbalistic writings. In his attempt to explain certain passages in the Bible in an allegorical manner, More leans on Maimonides' talmudic statement, "The Torah speaketh according to the language of man," {Guide, I, 26; Conjectura Cabbalistica (London, 1713), p. 50). More similarly alludes to Maimonides, whom he calls "the most rational of all the Jewish Doctors," on the subject of similes in the Bible when he quotes from the Introduction to the Guide: "A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver" (ibid.., p. 54). In his interpretation of the chapters dealing with creation in Genesis, More continues to follow Maimonides' philosophical interpretation in the Guide, II, 30 (ibid., pp. 57-58), and alludes again to the Guide (I, 49) in his discussion of Angelology (p. 107).

He was educated at Grantham School and Trinity College, Cambridge, of which he was elected Fellow in 1667. After 1694 he moved to London. He had been a member of the Royal Society since 1672 and was its president from 1703 until his death. Though a conforming Churchman, Newton was not orthodox. He denied the doctrine of the Trinity which he considered contradictory to reason. Some of his theological views are included in Observations on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John (1733). As I did not examine the extensive collection of Newton manuscripts in the Jewish National and University Library, Jerusalem, I can only allude to a few references in the recent literature on this sage. The prolific scholar, Frank E. Manuel, has sensed certain influences of the Sage of Fostat on the English philosopher and physicist. Manuel reports: "During Newton's tenure at Cambridge, a great Hebraist, John SPENCER, was elected Master of Corpus Christi in 1667 and occupied the post with distinction until his death in 1693. The impress of his studies in comparative religion, and especially his important De Legibus Hebraeorum, is marked throughout Newton's manuscript renderings of religious history. Spencer was also his guide in interpreting the nature of prophetic revelation, following the Maimonides tradition, which stresses the rigorous rational and moral preparation of the prophet rather than his wild ecstacy (F.E. Manuel, Portrait of Isaac Newton, 1968, p. 121). In a similar vein, Manuel writes: Newton's conception of prophecy remained completely in the tradition of Maimonides; it was not wild enthusiasm or mystical illumination, but a granting of truths to men whose striving for the perfection of reason and whose imaginative capacities had, after mighty labors, put them in harmony with the divine will (ibid., p. 368; see also his The Religion of Isaac Newton, 1974, pp. 67, 68, 84). Richard S. Westfall, who also examined the Newton archives in Jerusalem reported that Newton, when writing the history of the Church, plunged into an extensive program of reading into Josephus, Philo, Maimonides, and the talmudic scholars (Never at Rest: Biography of Isaac Newton, 1980, p. 346). Nachum L. Rabinovitch (see bibl.) claims that Newton's comparison of the structure of the heavens with that of the living organisms reflects Maimonides' influence. Very interesting are the remarks by Baron John Maynard Keynes, the distinguished economist and philosopher: He [Newton] was...a Judaic monotheist of the school of Maimonides. He arrived at this conclusion, not on so-to-speak rational or sceptical grounds, but entirely on the interpretation of ancient authority. He was persuaded that the revealed documents give no support to the Trinitarian doctrine. (Essays and Sketches in Biography, 1956, p. 285; quoted in the 15th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, yol. 16, 1973, p. 421 and by McLachlan, (see bibl.), p. 13. Finally, it is most appropriate to conclude this brief review with a quotation by H. McLachlan, who edited Newton's Theological Manu scripts: There is evidence of Newton's interest in Maimonides, whose Guide for the Perplexed argued that "God is a free cause, but a rational one, his rationality lying in the homogeneity of his creation." Spinoza was one of his debtors, and Newton though not a pantheist, may have been another. In his notes from Irenaeus and others, there is one 273</page><page sequence="26">of six pages. "Ex Maimonides de Cultu Divino" [Latin title of Mishneh Torah, Book of Temple Service], and other extracts in a collection of theological notes, whilst in "The Language of the Prophets" he also cites it a few times. For both men laws of nature are originally divine decrees. Newton was familiar with rabbinical commentaries and with writers like Buxtorf [translator of Maimonides* Guide for the Perplexed] and LIGHTFOOT [a Maimonidean scholar). The Church he regarded as essentially a development of the synagogue...Newton agreed with Maimonides that "The doors of interpretation are not closed," and, like him, was a moralist and a rationalist, but not a sceptic. Maimonides, however, aimed at a reconciliation of Aristotelian philosophy with Jewish theology, whilst Newton, in his own words, held "That religion and philosophy are to be preserved distinct. We are not to introduce divine revelations into philosophy nor philosophical opinions into religion." BIBL. Nachum L. Rabinovitch, "A 15th century law of large numbers," Isis 65(1974), p. 238; F.E.

NORWICH, WILLIAM (England?-Leicestershire, 1675) Graduated M.A. in 1629 and was a Fellow of Peterhouse, 1634 - 1641. He was Vicar of Cherry Hinton, Cambridgshire, from 1638 to 1641. In 1641 Norwich was appointed by Peterhouse as Rector of Stathern, Melton Mowbray, Leicestshire. When the struggle between King Charles I and the Parliament reached its height, Norwich unhesitatingly held to the King's cause. He was ejected in 1648, but after the accession of King Charles II was restored as Rector of Stathern. A Latin translation of Hilkot Teshubah is attributed to him: Ca?ones Poenitentiae Hebraice a R.

OCKHAM, WILLIAM (Occam, Surrey, c. 1280 - Munich, c. 1349) Scholastic philosopher; a Franciscan. He studied at Oxford and taught there until 1323. Then, deeply involved in the bitter quarrel between the more radical members of his order and Pope John XXII, he was summoned to Avignon and there imprisoned. In 1328 William fled to Pisa and placed himself under the protection of the emperor. He became a staunch supporter of Emperor Louis IV in the struggle with John XXII. He violently opposed the temporal power of the pope and wrote numerous 274</page><page sequence="27">works on the subject. William's Dialogus is a thorough discussion of political theories. In the broader realm of philosophy he broke with the Thomistic intellectualism dominant in his time. There is no direct reference to Maimonides in William's works. If he hadn't read the Guide, he could have known many of its doctrines through the allusions to them in the works of DUNS SCOTUS and Thomas Aquinas. Guttmann (see bibl.) finds Maimonides' view that it is philosophically impossible to prove the eternity of the universe reflected in Ockham {Comment, in Sent. II dist. 8 qu. 8. Lugduni 1495 according to Guttmann, p. 209). He may also, like other Scholastics (e.g., WILLIAM OF WARE), have been under the influence of Maimonides, who against a philosophical rationalism stressed the necessity of Revelation, and for this reason denied the possibility of proving the unity of God (P.

On the other hand, there is, according to Menges (see bibl.), a vast difference between the negative notion "non-insipiens" in the mind of Maimonides and the positive intellectual perfection of wisdom in Ockham's mind.

Patrick was educated at Queen's College, Cambridge, where he came under the influence of the Cambridge Platonist John SMITH, whose funeral sermon he preached. After the restoration of Charles II, he was elected master of Queen's College, but the election was overriden by royal mandate, perhaps because of Patrick's earlier record as a Presbyterian. After the revolution of 1688 and the overthrow of James II, Patrick was made Bishop of Chichester in 1689 as a reward for his various services. He was transferred to Ely in 1691, where he served until his death. Patrick was a voluminous writer on many subjects: Anglican theology, biblical exegesis and anti-Roman Catholic polemics. Of concern to us is his 275</page><page sequence="28">commentary on the Hebrew Bible. There is hardly a chapter in his comments on the Pentateuch where Patrick does not allude to the works of Maimonides, in particular The Guide of the Perplexed. BIBL. Patrick's commentary on the Bible was first published in London (1695-1710) in 10 volumes (many subsequent editions); New Cambridge Bibliography of Eng. Lit. (ed., G. Watson) II (1971) p. 1613; DNB, s.v. PEPPERCORNE, JAMES WATTS (England, fl. 1840) Nothing is known of his life. Motivated, apparently, by a desire to advance the plight of the poor in England during the agitation surrounding the Poor Law controversy, Peppercorne translated the section in the Mishneh Torah entitled : The Laws of the Hebrews, relating to the poor and the stranger. From the "Mischana-Hathora" of the Rabbi Maimonides. Now first translated into English by James Peppercorne. With an introduction upon the "Rights of Necessity; " an account of the life and writings of Maimonides; - remarks upon the fertility of the Holy Land; and illustrative notes. London: P. Richardson, 1840. "It is not clear whether this version was translated from the original Hebrew or from the Latin of Humphrey PRIDEAUX (1679). All indications point to the latter" (A. Cronbach, HUCA XX (1947), p. 478). The work, which was preceded by a thirty-eight page biography of Maimonides (also printed separately), is dedicated to the Right Honorable The Earl Stanhope, F.R.S., and reads as follows: The strenuous opponent of the new-fangled doctrines of Political-economists, and of their heartless and sordid schemes for degrading and crushing the poor; and for converting English labourers into machines of packhorses, to be employed in the creation of "surplus-produce": this translation of the humane "Laws of the Hebrews," for the succour of their poor, is with his Lordship's permission respectfully dedicated by his Lordship's obedient servant... The Earl of Stanhope referred to was Philip Henry, fourth Earl of Stanhope (1781 - 1855). The volume also includes an introductory study entitled, "The Rights of Necessity, and the Treatment of the Necessitous by Various Nations," bearing the following motto from Maimonides' above mentioned work: Woe therefore unto him, whoever he may be, that treateth the Poor with ignominy! Woe! unto him, I say. Rather be unto the Poor as a Father, both in pity and in consolation; for is it not written, (Job XXIX) ? "I was a Father to the Poor" ? Maimonides (Mattenot *Aniyyim, X, 5). This English translation is more than a scholarly exercise. Following the Latin translation by Prideaux, which was published more than a century and a half before, Peppercorne introduced Maimonides' work to his English countrymen as a political and humanistic document of historic magnitude.

POCOCKE, EDWARD (Oxford, Nov. 8, 1604 - Sept. 12,1691) Orientalist and Hebraist. He studied Oriental languages at Oxford and elsewhere and became professor of Arabic at Oxford in 1636. He spent the period from 1637 to 1640 in Constantinople, and on returning to England in 1647 resumed his professorship of Arabic at Oxford. Pococke also became professor of Hebrew in 1649, which position he held until his death, although he was frequently attacked for political reasons. During his stay in the East, Pococke also cultivated friendly relations with the Jews there and collected a large number of valuable manuscripts which now constitute the Pococke Collection in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. His erudition was immense as is shown by the works he edited and translated, among which is the Porta Mosis. Porta Mosis sive Dissertationes aliquot a R.

RICHARDSON, SIR BENJAMIN WARD (Somersby , 1828 - London, Nov. 21, 1896) Physician and writer. He received his M.D. degree in 1854 and became an active member of the British Medical Association. He was knighted in 1893. Partly by descent and partly by intellectual sympathy and early bib lical training, Richardson became immersed in Jewish history and litera ture. Besides an historical novel, The Son of a Star (1888), based on the life of Bar Kokhba, he authored a work on the life of Maimonides which has remained in manuscript. The whereabouts of the unpublished work on Maimonides are unknown. In the biography of her father, Mrs. M.S. Richardson Martin (see bibl.) failed to mention this work on the Sage. In addition, in describing the pub lished novel, The Son of a Star, she refrained from mentioning that it was based on the life of Bar Kokhba, the famous Jewish general who fought for ancient Israel's independence from the Romans; instead, she substituted a vague description ? a novel dealing with the first century, apparently to cover up her father's Jewish descent and intellectual sympathy, which was revealed in Richardson's obituary in the Jewish Chronicle (see bibl.). It is also interesting to note that Sir Arthur Salusbury MacNalty, who had access to Richardson's unpublished works, described them in his biog raphy of the latter. Unfortunately, the Maimonides item is not listed. It is possible that Mrs. Martin, for the above reasons, destroyed this work. BIBL. Jewish Chronicle (Nov. 27, 1898), p. 8; Jewish Enc. X, 406; M.S.

ROLLE, RICHARD OF HAMPOLE (Thornton, Yorkshire, England, 1290? - Sept. 29, 1349) English mystic. He was educated in Oxford but soon developed ascetic tendencies and became a wandering hermit, frequently preaching and de nouncing the vices of the times. He finally established himself in Hampole, near Doncaster (southern Yorkshire), in the vicinity of the Cistercian nun nery of St. Mary, which was under his spiritual guidance. For a time miracles were attributed to Rolle with a view to his canonization, but the honor was never affected. That failure may have been due to his singular independence, for he never joined a monastic order and was not ordained. He was ortho dox, but anti-establishment and a non-conformist. Rolle is one of the first religious authors to write in the vernacular as well as in Latin. He wrote abundantly in Latin and in English, and some treatises exist in both languages. His main English work is a long ethical poem, the Pricke of Conscience (9, 624 lines) which was soon translated into Latin, Stimulus Conscientiae. It is in this work that we find a reference to an as tronomical estimate of the dimensions and distances of the spheres and the stars as noted in the Guide (III, 14) ? that the distance of the earth from the moon is five hundred winters: From the earth until the circle of the moon is the distance of five hundred winters, and no less that is as much space as a man might go in full journey in five hundred years if he could live so long in his body, as a great philosopher who is called Rabbi Moses tells us aright: that through his great knowledge could see this. And over and above that, he continues, that the visible circle of that planet may contain as men may find written there the way of five hundred years as it is divided in breath and thickness so great and thick this one is they say there is as much space there as a man might travel in five hundred years. (The Pricke of Conscience, ed., R. Morris (Berlin, 1863), pp. 206-207; free translation from Old English by Professor Irving Linn) This curious estimate of "astronomical" distance reflects a crude attempt to impress the lay mind with the vastness of the universe to which it belongs (G.R. Owst, Literature and Pulpit in MedievalEngland, p. 192). BIBL. G.R. Owst, Literature and Pulpit in Medieval England (1933), p. 192; Oxford Diet, of the Christian Church (ed., F.L. Cross), s.v.; G.

It should be noted that the ascription of this work to Rolle is now generally disputed. SCOTT, MICHAEL (Scotland, 1175- 1234?) Philosopher, alchemist, astrologer, translator from Arabic into Latin. Studied at Oxford and on the Continent, and was attached to the court of the Emperor Frederic II, probably in the capacity of official astrologer and translator; his later works were dedicated to him. He was sent by Frederick II circa 1230 to the universities of Europe to inform them of versions of Aristotle created by Michale and others. Legends of his magical power have served as a theme for many great writers from Dante ('Inferno', c. XX, 116) to Sir W. SCOTT ('Lay of the Last Minstrel'). His writings are mainly philosophical and astrological, but they show glimpses of a genuine experimental point of view (Sarton, Introduction, II, 579). The friendship between Scott and Jacob Anatoli is one of the most significant in the history of medieval thought. Anatoli in his Malmad ha-Talmidin speaks with reverence of Scott. There is even an hypothesis that Anatoli is the Jew, Andreas, who, according to Roger Bacon in his Compendium Studii, assisted Michael Scott in his philosophical translations from the Arabic. There is a hypothesis as yet unproved, though advanced with considerable force, that Anatoli, in conjunction with Michael Scott, translated into Latin Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed from the second Hebrew version of Harizi.

He attended the University of Edinburgh, and after serving an apprenticeship to his father who was a writer to the signet, he was called to the bar in 1792. Infantile paralysis in his second year left 280</page><page sequence="33">Scott lame. His interest, however, was in the old Border tales and ballads which were stimulated by the study of the old romantic poetry of France, Italy and of the modern German poets. After having published poems and ballads for some time, he felt that he was eclipsed by Byron as a poet, and in spite of the great popularity of his verse romances, he therefore turned his attention to the novel as a means of giving play to his erudition and his sympathies. Scott eventually became the most popular British novelist. However, it is his novel, The Talisman, which first appeared in 1825, which is of interest here. The story is concerned with the forces of the Crusaders, led by Richard I of England, encamped in Palestine against Saladin of Egypt who invaded the Holy Land and captures Jerusalem. When Richard was seized with ague, the chivalrous and magnanimous Saladin sent him his personal physician, Al Hakim, to cure him. It is believed by some that the characterization of the Arabic physician in this novel was suggested to Sir Walter Scott by the life of Maimonides. BIBL. D. I.

SELDEN, JOHN (Salvington, West Tarring, Sussex, Dec. 16, 1584 - London, Nov. 30, 1654) English jurist, statesman and archaeologist. Educated at Oxford but did not graduate, leaving college to take up the study of law at Clifford Inn. In 1604 he was admitted to the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1612. Seiden had an exceptional command of oriental languages, notably biblical and rabbinical Hebrew. He was an exceedingly voluminous writer, and was one of the leading jurists on the side of the Parliamentarians in the struggle which led to the Civil War. He suffered imprisonment for his opinions. Almost all of Selden's works refer to and quote rabbinic opinions, particularly Maimonides. Those of special interest to Jewish literature are: 1) Historie of Tithes (1618). In it Seiden begins the history of tithes with Melchizedek (Gen. 14:18), and he traces it throughout the Bible and Talmud to Maimonides' code, the Mishneh Torah. 2) De successionibus in bona defunctL.and leges Ebraeorum (London, 1631). On the law of inheritance. It covers every phase of the subject and is more than a synopsis of the section in Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, entitled Nahaloth, or Inheritance. Seiden culled together materials bearing upon this subject from other parts of Maimonides' code and incorporated them under appropriate headings. 3) De Anno Civil et Calendario Veteris Ecclesiae seu Reipublicae Judaicae Dissertatio (London, 1644). A Treatise on the Jewish calendar and a study of the doctrines and practices of the Karaites, the anti-talmudic sect which sprung up during the Middle Ages. 281</page><page sequence="34">4) Uxor ebraica, seu de nuptis et divortiis veterum Ebraeorwn libri tres (London, 1646). On Jewish law of marriage and divorce. 5) De Synedriis Veterum Ebraeorum, 3 vols. (London, 1650-1655). An account of the history, constitution and functions of the Jewish courts. The principal themes treated are the Seven Noachide Commandments, the status of the Proselyte of the Gate, pre-Mosaic courts of justice, capital punishment, the penalty of excommunication beginning with Adam, the ineligibility of women for the office of judge, ordination of judges, Noachide courts, the requisite number of members for constituting courts of law of the various grades, the Seventy Elders who formed the first great Sanh?drin, or Supreme Court in Israel, officers charged with enforcing the law, Shoterim, penalties inflicted for the infringement of the law, the different kinds of tribunals, Bate Dinim, Courts of Arbitration, references to Jewish courts in the Roman codes, Jewish courts outside of Palestine, the semblance of the Sanh?drin in Babylonia, the laws of the paschal sacrifice, the regulations concerning the constitution of the great and small Sanh?drin, the Patriarch, Nasi, or Chief of the Sanh?drin, the King and the power of the law, etc. 6) De jure naturali et gentium: juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum (London, 1640). On international law in which Seiden calls attention to the analogy which Jewish law offers with Greek and Roman jurisprudence, in which he discusses the Noachide commandments, polygamy, excommunication, divorce, poor-law, capital punishment, the Jubilee year, war and peace, etc. In all the above mentioned works, Seiden displayed extraordinary talmudic erudition. But his principal source of information, according to Herzog (see bibl.), was Maimonides' code, for whose author he entertained a degree of admiration amounting to reverence. From Maimonides, he would appear to have worked his way backwards to the first-hand sources with the exception of the Bible, for which he required no assistance from later sources. Seiden was acquainted with The Guide of the Perplexed from which he acquired his knowledge of the Sabeans (S. Schmiedl, Studien, p. 326, note 2). BIBL. S.

His early activities included service in the par liamentary forces and in the council of state (1652-3, 1659), but he opposed Oliver Cromwell's dictatorial rule. At the Restoration, in 1660, he went into exile, returning by permission in 1677 to attend to private affairs. Stirred by the threat to constitutional government in the reaction following the Popish plot, he joined Lord William Russell and others in vague plots for an insurrection, perhaps to make James Scott, duke of Monmouth, a constitutional monarch. The plot was discovered, and after an unfair trial, Sidney was sentenced to death for treason and executed. His name was cleared in 1689. His chief work was Discourses Concerning Government (1698; 2nd ed., 1704). In his polemic against Sir Walter Raleigh's opinion about the alleged autocracy of the Kings of Israel, Sidney alludes to Maimonides: The great Sanh?drin were constituted judges, as Grotius says, most particularly of such matters as concern'd their Kings; as Maimonides affirms, that the Kings were judg'd by them: The distribution of the power to the inferior Sanh?drin, in every Tribe and City, with the right of calling the People together in general Assemblys as often as occassion requi'd, were the foundation of their Liberty...{Discourses Concerning Government (London, 1704), p. 239). Sidney, the republican, endeavored to justify his antimonarchial views by leaning on the classical Jewish sources, among which is Maimonides (ibid., pp. 84-85, 210, 238). BIBL. DNB, s.v.; LS.

SKYNNER, RALPH (England, c. 16-17 cent.) Skynner (sometimes spelled Skinner) was a curate at the Parish Church of St. Nicholas, Sutton, Surrey, some mile and a half from Nonesuch. The wife of Ralph Skynner was a sister of Lady Temple, the wife of Sir William Temple (1555-1627). The manuscript of an English translation by Skynner of the Book of Knowledge, the first book of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, may be found in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. It was there as far back as 1688, and is now in Archbishop Ussher's collection. An undated letter (c. 1624 or earlier) from Skynner addressed to James Ussher (1580-1656), Bishop of Meath, afterwards Archbishop of Armagh and Primate, forms an introduction to the work. This letter, which was subsequently published in Ussher's works (vol. XV (1864), pp. 236-256), was written from a Christological point of view and attempts to compare the Book of Knowledge with the tenets of Christianity: "Shall I reject Maymon 283</page><page sequence="36">[Maimonides], full of good Mammon, for some few errors?

Studied at Emanuel College, Cambridge, where B. Whichcote was his tutor. In 1644 he was chosen fellow of Queen's College. Smith, who was considered the most attractive figure of the Cambridge group, a "living library," managed in his short life to leave only one work behind, Select Discourses (Cambridge, 1859). This volume, it is claimed, is likely to outlive many of the more formal treatises by the Cambridge Platonists. Taken together, those discourses form the first part of a scheme of thought which Smith did not live to finish. His wide erudition, intellectual power and spiritual insight is equalled only by his mastery of English prose. Smith draws quite frequently upon Maimonides in most of his discourses, a few of which will be noted here. Because of his Platonic and Augustinian cast of thought, Smith gave particular attention to the immortality of the soul. It is on this subject that he found the opportune moment to warn his readers against Aristotle who "defaced the sacred monuments of the ancient metaphysical theology by his profane hands" and show his preference for Maimonides: In conjunction with the views of Aristotle respecting the soul, as separable, or inseparable, from the body, we may consider the opinion of a deep-thinking philosopher among the Jews. Maimonides, in like manner, looks upon the vegetative and sensitive part of the soul as inseparable from the body, and therefore, perishing together with it. The rational part, on the contrary, he considers as separable from the body, and co-existing after its destruction. Further, the difference between the two writers is what we might expect. The Greek philosopher believed in the eternal destruction of the body, and therefore with him the rational soul, though immortal, was to pass its future existence altogether apart from the body. With the Jew, the resurrection of the body was an article of faith, and therefore, the rational soul was to be reunited to it at some future period (Of the Immortality of the Soul, ch. VIII, pp. 109-110). Smith supports his remarks with a citation from Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (H. Yesode ha-Torah, IV, 9; ibid., p. 110). Some further points of theology are treated in the Discourse of the Existence and Nature of God where he similarly leans on Maimonides: And so, when Moses desired to behold the face of God, that is, as Jews understand it, that a distinct idea of the Divine essence might be imprinted upon his mind, God told him, 'No man can see me, and live';...as Maimonides expounds it: 'the understanding of the living man, who is compounded of body and soul, is utterly unable clearly to apprehend the Divine essence, to see it as it is' (Mishneh Torah, H. Yesode ha-Torah, I, 10; ibid., ch. X, p. 166). 284</page><page sequence="37">In discussing the problem of free will, Smith writes: And for this we have Maimonides speaking very fully and magisterially, that this was one of their radices fidei? articles of their faith?and one main foundation upon which the Law stood. His words are these: The power of free-will is given to every man to turn himself, if he will, to that which is good, and to be good; or to turn himself to that which is evil, and to be wicked, if he will. Both are in his power, according to what is written in the Law: Behold, man is become as one of us, to know good and evil (Gen. 3:22; that is to say, Behold, this sort of creature, man, is alone (and there is not a second like to man) in this viz. That man, from himself, by his own proper knowledge and power, knows good and evil, and does what pleaseth him in an uncontrollable way, so as none can hinder him as to the doing of either good or evil' (Mishneh Torah, H. Teshuvah, V, 1; OfLegal and Evangelical Righteousness chap. II, pp. 304-305). Smith further elaborates on this theme: But Maimonides hath somewhere told us...that when men endeavour after the performance of the Law, God, in a way of providence, furnisheth them with external matter and means, giving them peace, and riches, and outward accomodations, whereby they might have advantage and opportunity to perform all that good to which their own free-will determines them; whereas wicked men find the like help of external matter and means for promoting and accomplishing their wicked and ungodly designs (H. Teshuvah, IX, 1; ibid., p. 310). Maimonides is again referred to by Smith while discussing the theme of Reward and Punishment in the hereafter: This we find expressly set down by Maimonides...: 'All wicked ones whose evil deeds exceed their good deeds, shall be judged according to the measure of their evil deeds so exceeding; and afterwards they shall have a portion in the world to come; for that all Israelites have a portion in the world to come, and this, notwithstanding their sins' (H. Teshuvah, III, 5; ibid., chap. Ill, p. 317). The erudite Smith is also aware of Maimonides' Commentary to the Mishnah: "He that observes any one precept, &amp; c, that is, so as that the addition of this work to his other good works, his good works overweigh his evil works, and his merits preponderate over his demerits" (Kiddushin, I, 10; ibid., pp. 314-15). The subject of prophecy is one of the longest studies of his "Discourses," and Smith apparently had surveyed the most important works of Hebrew literature on this theme. Maimonides, however, figures practically on every other page, and he draws heavily on the Mishneh Torah and The Guide of the Perplexed. The references are too numerous to be listed here (On Prophecy, chap. VI-VIII, X-XII; ibid., pp. 228-293). Smith, apparently, adapted Maimonides' views of prophecy for his own ends, for he "evidently found in [him] a mental constitution akin to his own" (B. Willey (see bibl.), p. 149). BIBL. W.R.

He was educated at Cambridge (B.A., 1648; M.A. 1652; B.D., 1659; D.D. 1665), and eventually became dean of Ely in 1677. Spencer's Latin work on the ritual laws of the Hebrews (De legibus Hebraeorum Ritualibus et earum Rationibus libri tres, (Hague, 1685; in four volumes, Tuebingen, 1732) laid the foundations of the science of Comparative Religion, and remained by far the most important book on the religious antiquities of the Jews. Here he investigated the reasons for the Mosaic ritual and commandments. This classic, whose author was "so much before his time that his work ws not followed up," rests directly and confessedly on the third part of Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, which offers a masterly exposition of Pentateuchal law from the point of view of the science of cultural anthropology. Maimonides used historical insight to interpret biblical precepts as defenses against pagan beliefs and cults current in the biblical period. With regard to the sacrificial laws, Maimonides went even further by considering sacrifices as a concession to the mentality of ancient times when even Israel, under the influence of paganism, could not conceive of worship without animal sacrifices (Guide, III, 32). "If we knew all the particulars of the Sabaean worship," Maimonides writes, "and were informed of all the details of those doctrines, we should clearly see the reason and wisdom of every detail in the sacrificial service, in the laws concerning things that are unclean, and in other laws the objects of which I am unable to state" (Guide, III, 49). Spencer's work "is in essence a detailed working out of these chapters of Maimonides in the Guide." Spencer, who did not conceal his debt, constantly refers to the "Great Maimonides" and his "golden book" and says specifically in his Introduction (Prolog. Ill, ?4) that "Maimonides was the only previous worker in this field, and that those who follow only gather his harvest" (L. Roth - see bibl.). It was Julius Guttmann (see bibl.) in an exhaustive study on Spencer's relationship to Maimonides' explana tions of the biblical precepts, who cited many references by the English theologian to the Guide for the Perplexed upon which he based his theories of the science of comparative religion.

STILLINGFLEET, EDWARD (Cranborne, Dorset, April 17,1635 - Westminster, March 27,1699) Church of England Bishop of Worcester. He was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge (B.A. and fellow, 1653; M.A. 1656; B.D. 1663; D.D. 1668). In 1657 he was appointed rector of Sutton, Bedforshire, and 286</page><page sequence="39">in 1665 rector of St. Andrew's Holborn. In 1689 he became Bishop of Worcester, and as such took part in the commission for revising the Book of Common Prayer. A distinguished preacher and polemicist, Stillingfleet participated in the doctrinal controversies of his age and even took on John Locke for his Essay on the Human Understanding, which he considered detrimental to the Trinitarian faith. To Stillingfleet's criticism, Locke replied in January 1697 in A Letter to the Bishop of Worcester. Stillingfleet answered this in May, and Locke was ready with a second letter in August. Stillingfleet replied in 1698, and Locke's lengthy third letter appeared in 1699. Stillingfleet's death, later in the same year, put an end to the controversy (W.R. Sorley, A History of English Philosophy, p. 108). Of his many writings of interest here is his Origines Sacrae, or Rational Account of the Grounds of Natural and Revealed Religion (first appeared in 1662) in which he dwelt upon the knowledge, fidelity, and integrity of Moses, and the inspiration of the prophets as inferred from the fulfillment of their prophecies. It is mainly in this work that he quotes Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed and Mishneh Torah: 1) Stillingfleet draws his knowledge of the Sabeans or Star-Worshippers from the Guide (III, 29) in which Maimonides explains the reasons for the commandments: "Concerning these Zabii, Maimonides tells us, that the understanding [of] their rites would give a great deal of light to several passages of Scripture which now lie in obscurity..." (Origines Sacrae, vol. I, pp. 52-53). 2) Maimonides' teachings on prophecy as formulated in the Mishneh Torah and in the Guide are frequently cited by Stillingfleet. In his discussion of the qualifications of a prophet, the reader is referred to Mishneh Torah, H. Yesode ha-Torah, VII, 1, and Guide, II, 36) ibid., pp. 192-193). Similarly, Maimonides' formulation of the trial and punishment of false prophets ('Akurn, V; Yesode ha-Torah, IX, 2) is closely analyzed by him (ibid., pp. 200-205, 211 ff.). Maimonides' theory that the criterion of a true prophet is not his ability to work miracles (Yesode ha-Torah, VIII, 1) aroused Stillingfleet's ire for it implied a refutation of Jesus' qualifications: "All their [the Jews'] design in this is, only to lessen the miracles of our blessed Saviour, and to derogate all they can from the belief of them. Hence they tell us, that nothing is so easy to be done as miracles..." (ibid., p. 246-248). 3) The immutability of the Torah as God's Law, one of Maimonides' articles of faith naturally conflicted with Stillingfleet's Christian beliefs. In his view, the Gospels superseded the Law of Moses. He, therefore, dedicated an entire chapter to argue against this article of faith, alluding to many passages in the Guide and Mishneh Torah, H. Yesode ha-Torah and 'Akurn (ibid., pp. 249 ff.). 4) Maimonides' theory of creation (Guide, II, 25) is embraced by Stillingfleet and shares with him his sharp opposition to Aristotle's concept of the eternity of the universe (Origines Sacrae, vol. II, pp. 2 ff.). He also follows Maimonides in his theory of Creatio ex nihilo (Guide, II, 17) in which he refutes Aristotle (ibid., pp. 16 ff.). BIBL. NewSchaff-HerzogRe?. Ene.

TAYLOR, JEREMY (Cambridge, Aug. 15,1613 - Lisburn, Ireland, Aug. 13, 1667) Anglican bishop, theologian, and devotional writer. He was distinguished as a preacher and as the author of some of the most noted devotional writings. Soon after he completed his studies at Cambridge University and had taken holy orders (1633), he was appointed (1635) to a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. After holding numerous offices, Taylor went to Lisburn in 1658 as a lecturer, and in 1660 was appointed Bishop of Down and Connor and vice-chancellor of Dublin University. Taylor has been called the Shakespeare and the Spencer of the pulpit because his works have become classics for their beautiful prose. His writings, entitled Whole Works were issued several times by various editors. In his rational account of divinity, Taylor alludes often to Maimonides. He accepts with approval Maimonides' reasons for the Sabbath as a day of rest: R. Moses ben Maim?n, in his Moren Nevochim (Guide, III, 43] affirms, that the end of the sabbath is...'that we should spend the seventh part of our life in ease and rest; and preserve the faith and memory of the article of the world's creation' (Whole Works, II (London, 1836), p. 264). Taylor also quotes Maimonides' explanation for forbidden marriage between nephew and aunt but not between niece and uncle (Guide, III, 49; Whole Works, III (London, 1850), p. 230). References to Maimonides occur in other parts of his works (e.g., Ill (1850), pp. 14, 158, 187, 295, 436, 461). It is suggested that the title of Taylor's casuistical work, Ductor Dubitantium, is a paraphrase of the title of the first published Latin translation of the Guide: Rabbi Mossei Aegyptii Dux seu Director Dubitatium by Agostino Giustinani (Paris, 1520).

Lit., I (1974), pp. 1984-87. THOMAS OF YORK (England, died in 1260) English Franciscan. Little is known of his life, but from the letters of his friend, Adam Marsh, the following data may be gathered. By 1245, Thomas had entered the Franciscan Order and was sufficiently advanced to be using the De Natura Rerum of Rabanus Maurus and the Metaphysics of Aris totle. Obtained his master's degree in Oxford, 1253; taught in Cambridge and Oxford. It seems that Thomas was not so concerned with the perpetuation of tra dition as with the popularization of the newly translated Aristotelian, Ara 288</page><page sequence="41">bic, and Jewish works, towards which he appears to have been drawn by an irresistible fascination. Thus, Christian thinkers are either ignored or cited less often than Aristotle, Averroes, R. Solomon Ibn Gabirol, and Maimoni des. D.E. Sharp adds: "Maimonides or Rabbi Moyses (as he is called) is a great favorite with Thomas, and it is not improbable that Thomas's strong personal tone ... was suggested by the writings of the Jewish philosopher" (Franciscan Philosophy at Oxford, p. 51, note 51). The Guide for the Per plexed is referred to by him as Mater philosophiae (ibid., p. 53). In his theory of becoming, Thomas accepts the fundamental elements in the theory of act and potency and, following Maimonides and Averroes, definitely identifies these terms with form and matter and continuously refers to Maimonides on this theme in his metaphysics (ibid., pp. 58, 69, 72, 77, 84, 87). As to the existence of matter in the Intelligences, Thomas again alludes to Maimonides (ibid., p. 103). On the possibility of an eternal crea tion ? one of the most important questions of medieval philosophy, Thomas relates in detail the account given by Maimonides of the arguments of Aris totle for an eternal world and the Jewish philosopher's criticism of them (ibid., p. 107; Jacob Guttmann, MfGWJ61 (1917), p. 261). The problem of creation leads Thomas to the question of God's knowledge. Here, too, he alludes to Maimonides who writes that nothing is willed unless it is known (Guide, III, 20). That which God knows is the eternal exemplar or idea used in the production of the world (Sharp, Franciscan Philosophy at Oxford, p. 108). Thomas takes note of Maimonides' Account of the Chariot, the metaphysical chapters in the Book of Ezekiel (Guttmann, ibid., p. 256), and the movements of the celestial spheres (ibid., pp. 256-257). Thomas also alludes to Maimonides' statement which limits Aristotle's authority concern ing nature to a knowledge of things, from the moon down to the center of the earth; only in this area did the Greek philosopher possess proof for his views. All his ideas, however, concerning the character of the higher spheres partake more of the nature of opinions than of philosophical certainties (Guide, II, 22; Guttmann, ibid., p. 260). BIBL.

TOWNLEY, JAMES (Manchester, May 11, 1774- Ramsgate, Dec. 12, 1833) Wesleyan divine, son of Thomas Townley, a Manchester tradesman. He became a member of the Wesleyan Methodist body in 1790 and a minister in 1796. In 1822 he received the degree of D.D. from the College of Princeton, New Jersey in recognition of his literary work. From 1827 to 1832 he acted as general secretary of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society and in 1829 was elected president of the Wesleyan Conference. Townley was the author of works on biblical literature and church history. 289</page><page sequence="42">In Maimonidean scholarship he is known to have made the first attempt at translating the Guide into English.

Besides sermons and various pamphlets, Tenison wrote the Creed of Mr. Hobbes Examined, (1670; 2nd ed., 1671), whixh is a dialogue, and was written (as he tells us in his preface), partly to vindicate religion from Hobbes Examined (1670; 2nd ed., 1671), which is a dialogue, and was Hobbist. In his work, Tenison presented a fictional debate between Hobbes and a student of divinity, and put in Hobbes' mouth accurate quotations or else faithful adaptations of Hobbes' printed utterances. After a few preliminary remarks, the debate proceeded to the subject of materialism. Hobbes first affirmed that there is a God, but he is material. To this the student replied with quotations arguing for the reality of spirit. One allusion is to Aristotle, in his doctrine of separate intelligences, meaning, according to Maimonides in his Guide (II, 6) "the same with those who maintain the existence of incorporeal angels" (Tenison, p. 19). In another context he argues against Hobbes: Maimonides in the same place [I, 59] acknowledgeth God to be incomprehensible, yet sheweth that He is incorporeal; and that something is to be known of him, besides His bare existence, because some men have better apprehension concerning God than others...(ibid., p. 30). Finally, in his explanation of the homonym nefesh, Tenison refers his disputant to Maimonides' explanation (I, 41) of this noun which signifies 'vitality,' 'blood,' 'reason,' 'soul,' and 'will' (ibid., p. 82).

He was in Louvain in the fall of 1517 before accepting short teaching positions in Paris and Tuebingen. It is here that he met John Reuchlin (1455-1522) whom he came to regard as his teacher and whom he succeeded as lecturer at Tuebingen. However, in 1523 Wakefield had already been summoned to return to England. He was appointed chap lain to Henry VIII in 1524 and began his Hebrew lectures at Cambridge in the same year. In 1530 Wakefield began his lectures at Oxford. Wakefield's major publication is the Oratio de Laudibus et Utilitatum Trium Linguarum (London, 1524) on the value of Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew. The work, which is the first book containing Hebrew letters appear ing in England, displays Wakefield's considerable rabbinic scholarship and his familiarity with medieval Hebrew literature. Among the authorities cited is Maimonides. BIBL. F. Rosenthal, "Robert Wakefield and the Beginning of Biblical Studies in Tudor England," Crozer Quarterly 29 (1952), pp. 173-180; G.

WARBURTON, WILLIAM (Newark-upon-Trent, Dec. 24, 1698 - Gloucester, June 7, 1779) Church of England Bishop of Gloucester. After being apprenticed for five years to an attorney (1719-1723), he decided on an ecclesiastical career, 291</page><page sequence="44">and was ordained a priest in 1727. After many promotions, he was made Bishop of Gloucester in 1760. He also played a conspicuous part in the lit erary world of his time by bringing out, in 1747, an edition of Shakespeare which was sharply criticized, and in 1751 an edition of Pope's works (he had been left Pope's literary executor). Warburton's writings, most of which were ecclesiastical, involved him in innumerable controversies. His most important work, The Divine Legation of Moses Demonstrated (London, 1765), was directed against the Deists, especially their doctrine of the Old Testament and their stress upon the omission of mention of immor tality in the Hebrew Scriptures. Warburton refutes their arguments by con structing, out of the very absence of such statements, a proof of the divinity of the Mosaic legislation. In this work "the excellent" Maimonides is often alluded to by Warburton in his analysis of his theological position (vo. Ill, book IV, pp. 20, 109). Warburton also refers to JOHN SPENCER who hath fully exhausted this subject, in his excellent work, De legibus Hebraeorum Rituali bus et earum Rationibus and thereby done great service to divine revelation; for the Ritual Law, when thus explained, is seen to be an Institution at the most beautiful and sublime contrivance... Warburton is quick to add that "this noble work is no other than a para phrase and comment on the third part of a famous treatise called More Nevochim [Guide for the Perplexed], of the Rabbi Moses Maimonides..." (vol. IV, book IV, pp. 25, 124-25). Finally, in his discussion of the Book of Job and the theory of providence, Warburton again echoes the opinion of Maimonides in the twenty-third chapter of the third part of the Guide (vol. V, book II, section 2, pp. 22-5). In his list of recommended books to his stu dents, he included Maimonides and he warned them that he had omitted all but writers of capital note who "are of necessary to be well digested." (A.W. Evans, pp. 224-25; see bibl.). BIBL. A.W. Evans, Warburton and the Warburtians (Oxford University Press, 1932); R.W. Ryley, William Warburton (Boston: Twayne Pubi. 1984). WILLIAM OF WARE (Ware, Hertfordshire, England, c. 1255 -60-d. ?) English philosopher. Studied at Oxford and entered the Franciscan Order. During the last two decades of the thirteenth century he lived in Paris. He is said to have been the pupil of ALEXANDER OF HALES and the teacher of DUNS SCOTUS. William wrote commentaries on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Quaestiones in IV libros sententiarum, of which there are many manuscripts, the greater part still unpublished. In the text of William of Ware published by P.P. Muscat (see bibl.), Wil liam denied that God's unity can be demonstrated and claimed that this belief is an article of faith, i.e., a dogma of the Church, the truth of which is derived from Scripture (Muscat, p. 348). In support of this thesis, Wil liam referred to Maimonides. Seymour Feldman (see bibl.) has demon strated that Maimonides indeed produced his own proofs of God's unity; that William was a bit careless in his reading of chapter 75 of Part I of the Guide. He further showed that Duns Scotus' mistaken account of Maimoni 292</page><page sequence="45">des' view on this topic is based upon William of Ware, as evident from the close linguistic similarity of both Scotus' and William's reports. P. Duhem (see bibl.) has shown that William's astronomical discussions are literally borrowed from the Guide. He does not give Maimonides' name but calls him The Rabbi (Raby). BIBL.

WOLLASTON, WILLIAM (Coton, Clanford, Staffordshire, Mar. 26, 1660 - London, Oct. 20, 1724) English moral philosopher and deist. He took the degree of M.A. at Cambridge, 1681. Taught school from 1681 to 1688 when he unexpectedly fell heir to a large estate and moved to London. Thereafter, he devoted himself to general learning and moral philosophy. He was the author of The Religion of Nature Delineated (London, 1722) which was so popular that it ran through eight editions by 1759. The book which had been published anonymously through most editions finally carried the author's name in the 1750 reprint. The book achieved rapid fame and within a few years 10,000 copies were sold and had received the compliment of transla tion into French at the Hague under the title Ebauche de la Religion Naturelle par Mr. Wollaston (1726), to be followed by a new edition in three 294</page><page sequence="47">volumes (1756). The French edition also contains translations of Wollaston's numerous Latin, Greek and Hebrew notes which the author had included in his work in their original version. The dean of Salisbury, John Clarke, had performed a similar service by translating those notes into English which were published in the last two editions of that work (1750 and 1759) and which also included his biography of the author. Queen Caroline is said to have read it three times, and in the Hermitage at Richmond, she placed a bust of Wollaston alongside those of Locke, Newton, and Samuel Clarke. The Religion of Nature Delineated, unlike much of the deistical writing of the period, is not a work of polemic but an attempt to determine, without recourse to revelation, what a rational man would consider natural religion to be. Theologically Wollaston, though basically rationalist, willingly accepted on a secondary level the theological and cosmological arguments for the existence of Deity. Emphasizing the self-sufficiency of Reason, constructing a system of morality without recourse to Revelation, Wollaston had offended the orthodox who sensed that Christianity played no part in his philosophy. Professor Alexander Altmann in his exhaustive study on this subject (see Bibl.), suspects "that the deeper reasons for Wollaston's remarkable independence from Christian theology lie not so much in his 'free thinking' as in the influence which Jewish theology exercised upon him." After expounding Wollaston's position in English Deism, Altmann turned to explore his rabbinic scholarship and see whether it had any influence on his philosophic position. From the 150 Hebrew quotations and references which Altmann located in Wollaston's footnotes to his work, one is impressed by his appreciation of the Hebrew legacy, which was most profound. "The astounding range of rabbinic literature on which he draws, and the sympathetic manner in which he enters into its spirit raise him far above" other Christian students of Jewish thought. We shall, in this survey, confine ourselves to Wollaston's allusions to the works of Maimonides in general and to the Guide of the Perplexed in particular. It is in these works that the English deist found most support for his exposition of Natural Religion and there is hardly any important topic in which the influence of the Jewish Sage does not make itself felt in some degree. Wollaston's outline of the attributes of God follows in large measure the medieval Jewish pattern. In demonstrating the unity of God, he mentions that Maimonides "having proved that there must be some Being who exists necessarily, or whose existence is necessary, proceeds from this necessity of existence to derive incorporeity, absolute simplicity, perfection, and particularly unity" (Religion of Nature, p. 70, n.c; Altmann, pp. 199-200). Wollaston does likewise. He emphatically states that God is but One, and that His manner of existence is not shared by any other being. "If any other could partake with Him in it, He must...be deficient and limited" (ibid., p. 70; Altmann, p. 200). "It is remarkable," Altmann writes, "to find Wollaston repeat the stern rejection of any violation of God's Unity which from Saadya onward forms a recurrent theme in medieval Jewish philoso phy" (ibid.). Wollaston agrees with Maimonides in yet another important aspect concerning the Doctrine of Divine attributes. He makes the point that when we speak of the internal essential attributes of God positively, as that He is 295</page><page sequence="48">omniscient, omnipotent, eternal, etc., the intent is only to say that there is no object of knowledge or power, which He does not know or cannot do. He exists without beginning and end, etc. ...That is, we may speak thus without pretending to comprehend His nature (ibid., p. 94; Altmann, ibid.). Here, Altmann asserts, we have clearly a restatement of Maimonides' doctrine of negative attributes, though Wollaston does not distinctly refer to his Jewish source. There are other instances of direct dependence on Maimonides without express acknowledgement. Thus, Wollaston takes care to explain that if "we ascribe mercy to God, or implore His mercy, it must not be understood to be mercy like that which is called compassion in us" (ibid., p. 115; Altmann, p. 200). This reflects Maimonides' words in the Guide I, 54 (Wollaston, p. 115; Altmann, p. 200). Wollaston's treatment of the problem of Divine Providence ? perhaps the most fascinating part of the book ? is, again, largely influenced by Maimonides' discussion of the subject. Like Maimonides, he sees Divine Providence at work in the "laws and provisions" of Nature (Wollaston, p. 95; Altmann, p. 200). He quotes from the Guide III, 17, the talmudic statement that "God sitteth and feedeth all, from the horns or the unicorns even unto the eggs of insects" (p. 95, n.a.), which, along with similar rabbinical sayings, Maimonides explains to mean that Providence takes care of the species of all living creatures, not of their individual members. Wollaston finds no difficulty in associating himself with this interpretation of the purposiveness of Nature as evidence of a general Providence. He is not so sure whether to agree with Maimonides that particular cases relating to inanimate or irrational beings such as "a leaf's falling from a tree, a spider's catching a flie, etc." are to be regarded as due to pure chance. He wonders how it is possible to separate them in every instance from the cases of rational beings (Wollaston, p. 95, n.b; Altmann, pp. 200-201). On the problem of Divine Providence which involves God's foreknowing things without abolishing the freedom of will, Wollaston falls back upon Maimonides. He makes it clear that God's manner of knowing must be "different from and infinitely transcending all the modes of apprehending things, which we know anything of" (Wollaston, p. 101; Altmann, p. 201). He quotes Maimonides' words to this effect (p. 101, n.c), and mentions his striking utterance that "To attempt to comprehend the manner of God's knowing is the same as to endeavour to be ourselves God" (p. 102, n.b.). As to the possibility of God foreknowing things without abolishing the freedom of the will, he once more relies on Maimonides' solution of the problem. After quoting from the Guide, III, 20, he adds, "Much might be inserted upon this subject...which I shall omit" (p. 102, n.b.; Altmann, p. 201). Having concluded his arguments for a particular Providence, Wollaston began to grapple with the problem of theodicy. How can a belief in a Divine Providence be upheld when we see "that things do not seem to be dealt with according to reason, virtuous and good men very oft labouring under adversity, pains, persecutions, whilst vicious, wicked, cruel men prevail and flourish?" (p. 110; Altmann, p. 202). After surveying the opinion of classical Hebrew literature, he alludes to Maimonides' opinion that "there are not more evil than good things in the world, but surely more of the latter" (p. 71, n.h.). 296</page><page sequence="49">BIBL.

Received his education in private schools, 1827-38; served an apprenticeship in the printing business, 1838-45, using his spare time to study oriental languages. In 1847 commenced printing and booksell ing that tended to further the study of the Hebrew Bible and its ancient ver sions. A prolific writer, Young is mainly known for his Analytical Concord ance to the Bible (1879), which attained universal recognition. A moderate Calvinist, he is also the translator of Maimonides' 613 Precepts which follow the Introduction to the Mishneh Torah.

He gained a reputation early as a philosopher and vigorously attacked the Nominalism of DUNS SCOTUS and WILLIAM OCKHAM. Wycliffe's attitude towards the church grew more and more radical as the Great Schism, and with it the deterioration in Papal prestige, continued. In bulls issued in 1377, Gregory XI pronounced against eighteen Wycliffite errors, and in 1382 the Blackfriars Council of London further condemned his teachings. Yet the final step was not taken until the Council of Constance (1415) passed judgment on 267 errors culled from his works and ordered his writings to be burned and his bones to be dug up. The last injunction was not actually fulfilled until 1428. Wycliffe and his associates produced two English versions of the Bible from the Latin Vulgate. 297</page><page sequence="50">In his conflict with the Church for imposing superfluous rites and ceremonies not originating in the Bible, Wycliffe alludes to Maimonides' enumeration of the biblical divine commandments, "but we have been burdened by more rites and human innovations for the transgressions of which we are punished more severely than for the violation of the Decalogue" (Tractatus de Mandatis Divinis, eds., J. Loserth &amp; F.D. Matthew. (London: Wyclif Society, 1922), p. 65. Wycliffe also quotes the Guide to the Perplexed (II, 61-62) in which Maimonides discusses the personal name of God known as the Tetra grammaton. He, apparently, used a Latin translation of that work which bore the title "Directio Perplexorum" and points to another Latin transla tion than that edited in 1520 by Guistinani: Sermones, vol.
