Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1990. 271pp., maps, photos, illus. Price: $45.00 This volume constitutes the catalogue accompa- nying a major exhibit of artefacts and photographs of the Mangbetu and neighbouring peoples of northeastern Zaire, organized by the editors and making use of the vast collection of artefacts and photographs belonging to the American Museum of Natural History. Yet this is far more than the usual accompanying catalogue by which a viewer may recall an excellent museum show. This is a major scholarly contribution to the ethno- graphic study of Zaire which will be essential reading for Africanists concerned with this area. It is also an important document for the study of the historic role of museums in the recording and study of preliterate peoples. The complexity and richness of the materials at issue elude a comprehensive analysis, even in such a long and lavishly illustrated volume, but this remains a singularly provocative and tantalizing collection of essays. To sustain this claim I briefly outline the contents of this volume and then discuss some of the important issues raised. The book is divided into twelve chapters, copious notes, and an excellent bibliography. Nine of these chapters deal mainly with the Mangbetu and are co- authored by Schildkrout and Keim, the former a social anthropologist (noted for her work in West Africa) and curator at the museum, and the latter a historian whose doctoral dissertation concerns this area. The three re- maining chapters consist of (1) a historical reconstruc- tion of the area's interethnic relations by Jan Vansina; (2) two essays, one by Didier Demolin on music and dance and one by Thomas Ross Miller on musical instruments; and (3) an essay by John Mack on Zande art und culture and the political connexions between the Azande and Mangbetu. Yet my characterization of these chapters in terms of ethnic groups is somewhat misleading. The prolonged and complex ties between diverse ethnic groups in this region tend to make con- ventional anthropological analyses by ethnic affiliation misleading. Both the interest and difficulty of studying this area derive from the diverse ways that economic and political ties of conquest, alliance, and trade blur ethnic and cultural boundaries. Indeed, the cross-fertilization between these peoples and territories reveals how fluid and volatile cultural changes and influences were in this region. This, in turn, provides a cautionary example to those who have worked elsewhere in Africa and perhaps underestimated the rapidity and ease with which beliefs, practices, artefacts, and technology diffused over the continent. The chapters by Demolin, Miller, Mack, and Van- sina are the least remarkable sections of the book, gen- erally providing descriptive background to the artefacts and their relation to social practices. It does appear bizarre that Vansina promotes a notion that the linguistic complexity of the area has resulted from "sociolinguistic conditions that occur wherever people define their ethnic affiliation according to the extended household they belong to - the usual situation among the Ubangian and Central Sudanic speakers of the area," whereas in contrast Bantu speakers are alleged to hold to the district rather than the household as "the main marker of ethnic identity. Consequently, many Bantu speakers abandoned their household language when they came under for- eign domination, leaving few linguistic traces" (70). The grounds for such implausible assertions are not provided. Schildkrout' s and Keim' s chapters describe be broad relations between art, ethnography, and history in northeastern Zaire; discuss the establishment of the rather fanciful European stereotypes developed about the Mangbetu at the turn of the century; describe the Anthropos 86.1991</page><page sequence="2">302 Rezensionen American Museum of Natural History's great Congo Expedition of 1909-1915; portray Mangbetu social or- ganization during the early colonial period; discuss the relation of Mangbetu art und technology to daily life; de- scribe Mangbetu bodily adornment; consider the relation of art and technology to the exercise of Mangbetu royal power and authority; portray some aspects of Mangbetu thought; and summarize what they consider to be the key issues raised by the study of Mangbetu art. The major theme of the essays concerns the reasons for the efflorescence of Mangbetu art at the turn of the century. The expansion of native polities among the Mangbetu and neighbouring Azande coincided with the arrival of Europeans and the infusion of arms and goods into the area. Finely crafted objects became means of exchange with local allies and subordinates as well as with colonial administrators. New goods such as beads and brass wire, a new appreciation of ivory as a measure of political power, and European interest in anthropomorphic carving all transformed a rich materi- al culture into an even more complex and variegated assemblage. Ironically, the anthropomorphic carvings particularly associated by Europeans with this area are confined to this time period; there is no evidence for this traditionally and though Mangbetu culture remains vigorous, these are rarely produced today. Schildkrout and Keim credit the importance of European influence and the widespread intercultural contacts fostered by African political expansion and European colonization for the promoting of these new artistic activities and aesthetic criteria. They also emphasize how this art, unlike that for much of Africa, was mainly produced for personal consumption and for exchange by a prosperous and aesthetically appreciative public and not for any traditional "ritual," communal use. These are valuable observations likely to correct assumptions by some writ- ers on African art, though I think that the authors may have somewhat underestimated current sophistication among contemporary African art scholars. For me, the most interesting aspect of this volume is the authors' discussion of the European and American stereotypes of African (and especially Mangbetu) culture current at the turn of the century and the relation of such understanding and research to political and scholarly institutions, especially museums. The American Museum of Natural History's re- search expedition to the Congo undoubtedly had a pro- found impact of Mangbetu society and culture. The expedition remained in the Congo for nearly six years, employed over 38,000 porters and influenced both the manufacture and form of artefacts. The sheer volume of material collected is staggering: 4,000 ethnographic arte- facts, 9,000 photographs, 5,800 specimens of mammals, 4,800 specimens of reptiles, 6,000 specimens offish, and 100,000 specimens of invertebrates, in addition to ex- tensive written observations and drawings. The potential for further research of these materials is surely far from exhausted. The authors provide extensive and revealing extracts from the writings of the two museum curators in charge of the expedition, the American ornithologist Chapin and the German-born Lang, a mammalogist responsible for the bulk of the ethnographic collection as well as the invaluable photographs. Neither curator had any training in the social sciences and their views on preliterate societies were crude at best. Yet their extraordinarily prolonged stay in the area, along with the close contacts with natives inevitable for two white men cut off from most outside contacts for years at a time led to many perceptive observations. Most significant of all, their training as naturalists prompted both to keep detailed records of all their specimens. King Leopold II of the Belgians donated a large number of ethnographic and biological specimens to the museum and even contributed to the cost of the Lang and Chapin expedition. It is consequently not surprising that both Lang and Chapin wrote defensively, even enthusi- astically, of the Belgian effort at colonialism, even while other writers were publishing appalling accounts of Bel- gian atrocities and the gross inhumanity and cupidity of Leopold's policies. Schildkrout and Keim briefly refer to these issues, but a bit more contextualization and references would have been useful, especially for readers who are likely to be unfamiliar with African history but who purchased this volume on account of attending this superb exhibit. The authors' accounts of Mangbetu society and its relation to the artefacts are informative, but are probably limited by the fact that although much has been written about the Mangbetu, no first-rate modern social anthro- pological analysis has ever been made of this important people. Consequently, there are odd gaps in the informa- tion provided here. For example, we learn much about the Mangbetu' s concern with good fortune, witchcraft, and sorcery, and the powers believed inherent in var- ious materials utilized in decorations and apparel, but we learn little about how the Mangbetu view the two genders and how they think about different parts of the human body. Yet a great deal of this material, especially apparel, ornaments, and anthropomorphic motifs can be understood only by learning more about Mangbetu concepts regarding sex and the body. Still, given what is available, the authors' accounts are very helpful and informative. Yet however valuable the text is, the great- est value of this volume remains the immensely rich illustrations: 3 excellent maps, 12 charming renderings of Mangbetu gourd incisions, 88 superb photographs and illustrations of people and places, and 147 photographs of magnificent artefacts, many in colour. This is one of the most rewarding publications I have ever read in association with a major exhibit. T. O. Beidelman</page></plain_text>
