      <p>Sometimes one would like the chance to begin an article twice. This is one of those times. It is one of those times because I would like to begin by saying that the anthropology of Christianity is 15 years old, and then I would like to go on to make a point about what it means for an area of academic study to be that age. But I know from long experience that I cannot begin quite this way, because as soon as I say the anthropology of Christianity is about 15 years old, I have to pause to defend this claim against those who argue that it is much older—if not as old as the discipline of anthropology itself, then at least as old as the first ethnographic writings focused on Christian groups. And once I pause to make that point and address it in the detail it deserves, I have lost any momentum my argument about what it means to be a 15-year-old area of study might have had. So what I would like to do at this point is announce that in the section that immediately follows I will make an argument about why it is reasonable to claim the anthropology of Christianity is roughly 15 years old. And then I would like to be allowed to begin this opening section again with the assertion that it is.</p>
      <p>The anthropology of Christianity is roughly 15 years old. In academic years (to be understood here on something like the model of “dog years”), this turns out to be middle-aged. The image of middle age fits the contemporary anthropology of Christianity in several senses. It has gone from being an upstart to being respectable (at least in many quarters); it is less interested in picking fights with more established anthropological programs than it once was; and it is possessed of a rapidly maturing second generation, the members of which have never been part of a discipline of anthropology that did not pay a good deal of attention to Christianity. But one sense in which the image of middle age is perhaps slightly inappropriate when applied to a 15-year-old academic trend such as the anthropology of Christianity is that many anthropological movements never make it much past this age. Often enough, by the time a given anthropological enthusiasm reaches 15 years of age, it is well on its way out of the center of disciplinary attention. Middle age, then, is at once a satisfying and worrisome time for any would-be intellectual movement, at least in an academic field as mobile as sociocultural anthropology.</p>
      <p>This issue, like the conference from which it sprang, has been designed both to take advantage of the middle-aged situation in which the anthropology of Christianity finds itself and to consider some of the dangers that come with reaching this point. At the most general level, the issue’s goals are twofold. On the one hand, it aims to assess what the anthropology of Christianity has accomplished in terms of producing new ethnographic materials and new theoretical arguments and to ask what novel developments in these areas might be on the horizon as a second generation of scholars, some junior and some more senior but moving in from other anthropological areas, begins to produce significant work. On the other hand, in a more reflexive mood, it aims to assess whether the anthropology of Christianity as a “movement” or “trend” or “subfield” or however it might best be described ought to continue to develop in the way it has—as something that for at least some of those who have contributed to it has been a self-conscious collective project—or whether the time has perhaps arrived for it to become something more diffuse, as arguably happens to most successful middle-aged anthropological developments once scholars who once framed much of their work in trend-relevant terms begin to take as background knowledge much of what they have learned from being part of a growing movement and go on to pursue new questions.</p>
      <p>From the start, then, this issue has been conceived both as a forum for the presentation of the empirical and theoretical results of some current anthropological research on Christianity and as an opportunity to reflect on the anthropology of Christianity as a phenomenon within anthropology. As the issue has turned out, the articles it collects are for the most part explicitly engaged in the first of these goals: presenting new developments in the anthropological study of Christianity. A few of the authors were tasked by the original conference plan with taking up now established themes in the anthropology of Christianity, such as those involving materiality, cultural change, and the nature of religious experience. Others were asked to engage with a host of emergent concerns, including schism and the nature of Christian social organization, gender, space, and how anthropologists might study religious (and nonreligious) practices at the boundaries of Christianity. In taking up both kinds of topics, contributors have understandably focused on making new arguments and presenting new research materials, and with few exceptions the reflexive side of the design of the conference has been set aside.</p>
      <p>Yet even as the articles in this issue are mostly focused on the presentation of new ethnographic and historical materials and new theoretical arguments concerning Christianity, the conference discussions themselves were, as planned, also rich in reflexive discussions concerning the nature of the anthropology of Christianity as a project, its past, and its potential future viability. In this introduction, I will take up issues belonging to these reflexive kinds of discussions, drawing on themes that emerged at the conference and those that have been raised in the broader anthropological literature on the anthropology of Christianity. I will also consider several of the most important theoretical and empirical developments charted in these articles, arguing on the basis of these developments that the anthropology of Christianity is perhaps set to transform itself in important ways that might justify it hanging around for at least one more turn around the very fast track of live anthropological concerns. First, though, by way of introducing the anthropology of Christianity and situating it in relation to other developments both within and outside of anthropology, I want to return to the question of how old this trend might reasonably be said to be.</p>
      <sec id="sc1">
         <title>Where Did the Anthropology of Christianity Come From, and How Old Is It?</title>
         <p>Having already made much of the age of the anthropology of Christianity and having noted that this is controversial topic, it makes sense to begin my discussion of critical questions bearing on the history, status, and possible future of this area of research by taking up the question of how old it really is. On the face of things, the case for suggesting that the anthropology of Christianity is more or less a child of the new millennium is not hard to make. The appearance in 2003 and 2006 of two edited collections entitled <italic>The Anthropology of Christianity</italic>, one edited by myself (Robbins 2003<italic>a</italic>) and the other by Fenella Cannell (2006<italic>a</italic>), and the publication also in 2006 of a volume edited by Matthew Engelke and Matt Tomlinson entitled <italic>The Limits of Meaning: Case Studies in the Anthropology of Christianity</italic>, might be taken as marking something of a watershed (and, indeed, these works have often been treated together in something like these terms in subsequent discussions, such as Barker 2008; Hann 2007; Jenkins 2012; McDougall 2009<italic>b</italic>). The editors of all three volumes claim that, at the time they were writing, the anthropology of Christianity was something new and that anthropologists had in the past largely ignored the study of Christianity, at least relative to the attention they had paid to other religious traditions, including other world religions. Furthermore, by the time these volumes appeared, many of those scholars who would become important figures in the early years of the anthropology of Christianity had already begun working in this area, and quite a few of them were numbered among the volumes’ contributors. And, finally, few will dispute that by around 2010 anthropological work on Christianity had begun to appear in such quantity that it came to occupy a position of prominence in the discipline of a kind it never had before. The appearance of these volumes in rapid succession, then, along with exponential growth in the number of publications focused on Christianity that began around the time that they appeared, all contribute to the plausibility of the claim that the anthropology of Christianity arose as a new development in the early years of this century (for a review of some of the literature from this early period, see Bialecki et al. 2008).</p>
         <p>Yet in spite of how easy it is to make a case that something new was afoot about 15 years ago, in casual conversation, and certainly in the peer review process, those who assert that the anthropology of Christianity is a recent arrival are familiar with the retort that in fact there is nothing new about it. Anthropologists, the argument goes, have been producing work on Christians for a very long time. From anthropological work on African Independent Churches that has been growing apace since the 1960s (Fernandez 1978) to studies of European communities in which Christianity is the dominant religion, there are many ethnographic works focused on Christian populations that appeared well before the alleged rise of the anthropology of Christianity. Moreover, Edith and Victor Turner had published high-profile work on Christian pilgrimage by 1978 (see Coleman 2014), several edited volumes focused on ethnographic studies of Christianity had been published near the end of the 1980s (Barker 1990; James and Johnson 1988; Saunders 1988), Jean and John Comaroff had published the first volume of their highly influential study of missionization among the South African Tswana in 1991, and Robert Hefner had published an important edited book focused on the study of conversion to Christianity in 1993. In light of observations of this kind, Chris Hann (2007:394) has given published voice to the widespread concern that long before what some consider a new “anthropology of Christianity” began to emerge, there already existed a “far from inconsequential corpus” devoted to this topic (see also Chua 2012; Comaroff 2010).</p>
         <p>How, then, to settle the question of origins? In some respects, where one comes down on the question of whether the anthropology of Christianity appeared as something new in the early 2000s is going to be a matter of interpretation. Some people are allergic to finding breaks in history or are at least very cautious about doing so, and the historical record is generally complex enough to sustain at least some kind of argument that there is never anything new under the sun (a fact that should teach us something important about the nature of processes of even rapid social and cultural change). I remember one very prominent senior anthropologist telling me in the mid-1990s that the whole notion of globalization was nothing new. After all, he pointed out, anthropologists had been studying diffusion and acculturation for a long time. For someone of this cast of mind, it is unlikely that counterarguments that something new has in fact emerged will carry much weight. And more than this, given how important the theme of discontinuity and change has been in the anthropology of Christianity (see below), it is possible that those who are involved in studying at least some forms of the Christian tradition are predisposed to find themselves on the side of those who tend to see new things emerging whenever they can. If this is true, perhaps even in matters of their own historical experience they cannot be counted as reliable witnesses when they claim to have lived through a more or less sharp intellectual break with what came before.</p>
         <p>Yet even taking into account the difficulty of settling on appropriate grounds for deciding whether the anthropology of Christianity is really something new, it remains the case that several interesting and important questions arise if one argues that it is, and perhaps in intellectually pragmatic terms this makes its novelty worth positing. I would like to examine two of these questions here. The first question takes up the issue of the sense in which the anthropology of Christianity might be said to be new. If there have long existed at least some ethnographic studies of Christian populations, what is new about the work on Christianity that began to be published around the turn of the millennium, beyond the simple fact that it is appearing in much greater quantity than it was before? At least one important answer to this question is that the authors of this work were consistently self-conscious in several respects about what they were doing (Jenkins 2012:462). They were, for example, self-conscious that they were trying to get scholars working on Christianity to talk across boundaries of theoretical emphasis and regional ethnographic focus (see, e.g., Robbins 2003<italic>c</italic>). They were self-conscious about trying to use the vantage point provided by ethnographic work on Christians to push anthropological theory in new directions (e.g., Tomlinson and Engelke 2006). And they were self-conscious in exploring the ways anthropology as a discipline has been profoundly shaped by the Christian tradition (Cannell 2005, 2006<italic>b</italic>). Further, all of them were self-conscious about trying to explain why, at least as they saw it, anthropologists had relatively neglected Christianity in the past. To borrow terms I had used in my own first piece on the anthropology of Christianity, from the start, the current wave of the anthropology of Christianity has not been a matter of something that has happened simply “in itself”; it has also happened “for itself” as a deliberate effort to move the study of Christianity closer to the center of anthropological concern while at the same time constantly interrogating what this move might mean for the development of anthropology as a field (Robbins 2003<italic>c</italic>). Or, as Debra McDougall (2009<italic>b</italic>:168) has more recently put it, anthropologists have responded to Cannell’s (2006<italic>b</italic>:1) crucial early question of “What difference does Christianity make?” by “considering not only what difference it makes to believers but also what difference it makes to anthropology.”</p>
         <p>The second question we can ask if we assume that there is something new about the recent anthropology of Christianity—something that I have argued at least minimally consists in the self-conscious quality with which it approaches itself as a kind of anthropology—is why it happened when it did. Why did anthropologists begin to pay much more attention to Christianity around the year 2000, and why did they feel that the fact that they were doing so was of some significance to anthropology? In an early piece that represents a remarkable feat of writing intellectual history as it happens, Bronwen Douglas (2001) reviewed the uptick of work on Christianity in Melanesia that was then just beginning to become apparent against the background of a history of how anthropologists of the region had treated Christianity in the past. In the course of her discussion, she posed in very useful terms a regionally phrased version of a question I want to explore in more general terms here: was the study of Christianity in Melanesia suddenly beginning to accelerate because Melanesia was changing (e.g., because Christianity is becoming more important there) or because anthropology was changing (e.g., by beginning to redefine what counts as a legitimate object of study)? The answer she offered, and supported with exemplary thoroughness, is that both things were happening at once.</p>
         <p>In a very sophisticated recent article that I have already cited for its assertion that what is new about the recent anthropology of Christianity is its self-conscious quality, Timothy Jenkins (2012) makes a point akin to Douglas’s own when he argues that this self-consciousness was borne of changes at once in the world and in anthropology. On Jenkins’s account, what allowed for the advent of this self-consciousness about the place of Christianity within anthropology during the late twentieth century was the changing position of religion more generally in the world, including in the Western societies from which most of the new anthropologists of Christianity came, or in which they received their academic training. As Jenkins (2012:472) puts it, during this time period “the trajectories of secularization and modernization [came to] appear less convincing, or, at least, less simple to apprehend.” These changes allowed religion to reoccupy social space (outside the academy, of course, but also within it) that it had ceded during the height of secularist modernism, ringing changes both in the ways in which anthropologists encounter religion in the field, where its public presence and broad relevance to many domains of social life in many places are now difficult to ignore, and in the intellectual settings in which anthropological ideas find their final development (see also Bandak and Jørgensen 2012:452–453). The story of the public return of religion around the world that Jenkins alludes to here is by this point extremely well known, being told to great effect in José Casanova’s now foundational book from 1994 and in literally thousands of other books and articles across the social sciences and humanities since that time. Jenkins’s (2012:463) grounding of his historical account in a careful discussion of Susan Harding’s (2000) <italic>The Book of Jerry Falwell: Fundamentalist Language and Politics</italic>, a work that, he suggests, shows that “the categories of the investigating community may have been altered as part of the processes she is investigating,” demonstrates quite convincingly that both kinds of changes stirred the pot in which the contemporary anthropology of Christianity would eventually come to a boil.</p>
         <p>Seen in the terms Jenkins lays out, the rise of the anthropology of Christianity 15 or so years ago needs to be counted as one of a number of academic responses to the changing role of religion in the world. I will mention just a few of the kinds of academic responses I have in mind here, sticking primarily to ones that have had some influence on the anthropology of Christianity itself. But even an abbreviated list of this kind ought to provide an indication of why it might make sense in intellectual historical terms to focus on the novelty of the kind of anthropology of Christianity that arose during the period in question.</p>
         <p>Along with the development of a strong interest in the public role of religion that I have already mentioned, one has to count as a child of the period of change that preceded and then overlapped with development of the anthropology of Christianity the vigorous debate that has followed attempts to deconstruct the category of religion itself, which is best known among anthropologists through Talal Asad’s (1993) groundbreaking contribution, though the literature in this area is by now voluminous and spans many social science and humanities disciplines. When combined with the related and very wide-ranging debate about the nature of secularism that has flourished over the past decade (e.g., Asad 2003; Taylor 2007), these developments attest quite directly to a growing scholarly worry that our older understandings of the religious field no longer get much traction on the worlds we are trying to explore. Similarly, one should also note the turn within continental philosophy and critical theory toward a reengagement with religion (best known through the work of Agamben, Badiou, and Zizek), the growing prominence within more mainstream political philosophy of a call to recognize the importance of religion in people’s lives (familiar from the more recent work of Habermas, Rawls, and Taylor), and the emerging concern with political theology more generally, which, as Gil Anidjar (2009:374) notes, has been “quickly and deftly universalized” so as to be a phenomenon one can presumably find and study everywhere (de Vries and Sullivan 2006; Tomlinson and McDougall 2013). And along with all of this recent ferment in corners of the humanities and social sciences that had not in the second half of the twentieth century been known for a preoccupation with issues of religion, it is also noteworthy that within religious studies, history of religions, and theology, the same period that birthed these developments also saw the rise of a new discourse of “world Christianity” that has quickly begun to lend its imprimatur to institutes, academic positions, and textbooks (J. Cabrita, personal communication; see also Stanley 2011). The meaning of the label “world Christianity” is still a work in progress, but minimally it responds to the recognition that demographically speaking, at least, and in growing ways culturally speaking as well, Christianity is no longer best described as a “Western” religion (or, as insiders to this discourse often put, a religion of the “global North”; Philip Jenkins 2002 has been a foundational and much debated text for setting these terms for the discussion of world Christianity). As Kwame Bediako (2011:244) puts it, these changes render it “undeniable that what has occurred is a reconfiguration of the cultural manifestation of the Christian faith in the world, a phenomenon that one may also describe as a shift in the center of gravity of Christianity.”</p>
         <p>One could expand the list I have offered here of signs that the place of religion both in the world and in various intellectual discourses has been in a state of rapid and creative change over the past two decades or so. But I hope to have said enough to carry the main point I want to make: if we take the anthropology of Christianity as it is currently constituted as something new that has arisen over the past 15 years, then it makes sense to see it as one current in a much larger stream of contemporary work that attempts to explore the possibilities that come from rethinking academic approaches to the study of religion. The disciplinary self-consciousness of the anthropology of Christianity has rendered it a particularly anthropological contribution to this churning set of debates, and recognizing its novelty within the discipline itself is important for the way it will eventually allow us to determine what it shares with these other temporally overlapping intellectual developments and what its unique contributions to wider debates might turn out to be.</p>
         <p>In the confines of this introduction, I cannot do justice to the issue I have just raised about the specifically anthropological contributions the anthropology of Christianity is making to wider debates about religion, and it might be too early in historical terms to address it very fully in any case.<sup>1</sup> It is worth mentioning, however, that as a fieldwork discipline, sociocultural anthropology might be taken, at least when it is at its best, to be a scholarly endeavor that is unusually quick to register changes in the worlds that scholars study and not just in the intellectual frameworks by means of which they study them (I realize that this distinction between the worlds we study and the terms in which we study them is not an easy one to make in scholarly practice, but the openness to the world of fieldwork-based anthropology is point worth clinging to nonetheless—as Borneman and Hammoudi [2009] compellingly argue). In the spirit of this point, I want to draw attention to one further change in the world that Jenkins (2012) does not highlight and that scholars involved in the intellectual trends I have just enumerated, with the notable exception of those who write about world Christianity, tend to ignore. This is the fact that one of the great historical developments in the Christian tradition itself has occurred in the years immediately preceding the rise of the anthropology of Christianity and the other trends to which I have just referred.</p>
         <p>The development to which I refer is the explosive growth of Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity around the world and particularly in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Pacific. This growth began in the 1980s, and this form of Christianity now numbers roughly 580 million adherents around the globe (Pew Research Religion and Public Life Project 2011).<sup>2</sup> It is sufficiently different from other forms of Christianity that many scholars are inclined to treat it as a distinct stream within the broader Christian tradition, joining Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and Protestantism as a fourth “major” strand of the faith (Jacobson 2011:49). Considered in such terms, Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity are distinguished from other forms of Christianity by the stress they place on the assertion that the power of the Holy Spirit is available to all believers, allowing them to heal, prophesy, preach with authority, and exercise other gifts. Churches in this tradition foster a religious life in which prayer and other forms of ritual occur in all manner of contexts and in which religious concerns permeate both public life and private life. They foster, that is to say, a kind of religiosity that at once looks like the kind of total social phenomenon anthropologists of religion have long been used to studying and that it is impossible for field-workers to ignore.</p>
         <p>The rapid growth of Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity since the 1980s has meant that just as the place of religion in the world in general was changing in the ways Jenkins points out and just as scholars in a wide range of disciplines were beginning to register this fact, anthropologists in the field were encountering a new kind of Christian religiosity that made insistent claims on their attention. It is thus not surprising that much, though by no means all, of the early work in the anthropology of Christianity focused on churches of this kind. Indeed, almost from the outset of the development of work in this field, scholars of other kinds of Christianity worried that the anthropology of Christianity would end up becoming the anthropology of Pentecostalism (Howell 2003; see also Coleman 2014; Engelke 2014; Marshall 2014). Subsequent developments in the field and the contents of this issue itself put paid to this worry, but the fact that it was at the beginning a legitimate one points to the extent to which the growth of Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity was another worldly change that helped create the soil in which the anthropology of Christianity took root.</p>
         <p>I will leave off at this point considering the kinds of issues one can address if one takes the anthropology of Christianity to be something new that began to develop about 15 years ago. Understood in this way, the anthropology of Christianity takes its place alongside a wide range of other very broad developments in the academic study of religion during this time period, developments that have themselves been responses to a number of changes in religion and its place in the world. Even as I hope by means of this discussion to have offered some support for the claim that the anthropology of Christianity is something new and to have specified some of the senses in which such a claim can be reasonably made (one of which is decidedly not the sense that would suggest that no serious ethnographic work on Christianity had been done before the advent of the anthropology of Christianity), I have also endeavored to sketch in some of the context in which some scholars have made a recent push for an anthropology of Christianity.<sup>3</sup> This work of specification and contextualization should be worthwhile regardless of where one comes down on the question of whether this recent push is or is not unprecedented in the history of anthropology. The articles in this issue for the most part set aside this question of origins and instead focus on a range of new arguments and findings produced by anthropological research on Christianity. In the sections that follow, I consider the contributions of these articles and set them in relation to the more general development of this field.</p>

      <sec id="sc2">
         <title>Beyond Culture: Christian Institutions and the Study of Church, Denomination, and Schism</title>
         <p>One persistent criticism of the anthropology of Christianity is that it has been largely idealist in orientation (Hann 2007:402, 407; McDougall 2009<italic>a</italic>), perhaps even spearheading a return to an emphasis on culture within anthropology, particularly in the United States (Comaroff 2010:529). One could launch a serious theoretical discussion around this kind of complaint by asking precisely what aspects of human life are and are not cultural, for these critics generally at least imply that political-economic factors are outside of culture in some sense and that anthropologists of Christianity have ignored them for this reason. One wonders whether most anthropologists of Christianity would parse the human world into cultural and noncultural bits in this way (of course, their failure to do so might be taken as a symptom of their culturalism, but such a failure would not be the same thing as wholly ignoring what others take to be the noncultural bits). Moreover, it often seems as if these critics do not look with much care at the monographic literature the anthropology of Christianity has generated, for much of what they claim to find missing in the various programmatic writings they consult often is at least to some extent present in longer ethnographic accounts (as McDougall [2009<italic>a</italic>], for example, evenhandedly shows in her critical reading of my own work).</p>
         <p>Yet even if charges of culturalism and idealism are too broadly framed to be fully convincing, they are not without any merit at all. One of Hann’s (2007:407) most telling points in this regard is his claim that anthropologists of Christianity tend to use an idealist definition of Christianity as something like a culture to tie together disparate ethnographic cases in a single bundle. That is to say, anthropologists of Christianity proceed as if they know what Christianity is apart from the various instances of it they study, but they are able to do this, and hence to render diverse cases comparable, only by assuming an idealist definition of Christianity focused on Christian cosmological conceptions and values more than on Christian institutions. In doing so, it is probably fair to say that anthropologists of Christianity have given less attention than they might have to the ways in which Christian social institutions such as churches, denominations, and practices of schism might be also taken to provide grounds for comparability across cases. This is an oversight a number of the contributions to this issue go a long way toward correcting.</p>
         <p>John Barker (2014) tackles the issue of institutional invisibility most directly in his contribution. Taking on board the suggestion that to this point the “tendency has been to explore the nexus between global and local Christianity in broadly cultural terms,” he goes on to suggest that it is rather “in the domain of church structures and practices that locally diverse Christians engage a relatively unitary Christianity.” Barker substantiates this claim by looking at the long-term stability of the Anglican church as an institution among the Uiaku of Papua New Guinea. Even as he explores the various ways in which the church has been open to localization in Uiaku, he also shows that it has remained “obviously Anglican” in institutional form and emphasis. In this regard, he suggests, the Uiaku case is not unusual, for “one of the defining characteristics of the two thousand year expansion of Christianity across the globe is the planting of enduring institutional structures operating at local, regional and international levels.” As easily as we can identify various groups of Christians by their shared cosmological concerns or values, Barker is telling us, we can also recognize them by the kinds of institutions they inhabit. In light of Barker’s argument, one might suggest that anthropologists have not reckoned as fully as they might with the long-standing ecclesiological classification of types of church polity into only three kinds: episcopal, Presbyterian, and congregational. The very brevity of this list, even as it can be subject to all kinds of qualifying complications, is a hint that Barker is on a fruitful track in suggesting that looking at church structures is a promising way of reckoning with Christian diversity without losing momentum toward the development of the anthropology of Christianity as a comparative project (see Bialecki 2012 on issues of definition and comparison more generally in the anthropology of Christianity).</p>
         <p>Chris Hann (2014), in his article in this issue, also stresses the importance of looking at differences between church institutions, which for him is one part of a project of reorienting the anthropology of Christianity by means of attending to “macromaterialities” that he claims play a leading role in shaping religious life. In line with this assertion, he works throughout his article to show that Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox churches are not representatives of different civilizations or in possession of distinct ontologies but are rather differentiated by their patterns “for institutionalizing religion in the contemporary world” and their different political-economic situations across history. A key case for Hann’s argument that it is institutions and not ontologies that distinguish these churches is his careful analysis of the diffusion of the symbol of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary to some churches but not others over the past 300 years. Like Barker’s piece, Hann’s contribution demonstrates the value of attending to church structures (as well as to wider political-economic variables) in the comparative study of Christianity.</p>
         <p>The rest of the articles in this section follow Barker’s and Hann’s lead by attending both to church organizations and to the institutionalized means of transforming or leaving them—the characteristically Christian form of bringing about social change by means of schism. Courtney Handman (2014), looking at the history of Lutheran missionization and later schisms from the mission church and from its first successor church among the Guhu Samane of Papua New Guinea, explores how schism is rooted in “critique” of existing churches and their practices, a kind of critique that is generated on the basis of “the ethical demands of Christianity.” Such critique of existing church groups and practices is not an end in itself, however, for it leads first to “separation” from the rejected group and then “unification” either in a new church or with a reformed version of the one formerly left behind. As such, schism stands as a key Christian process of “group formation”—a social practice Handman pits against the better-studied tendency of some forms of Christianity to work toward producing the individual as their primary institutional accomplishment (especially, in Handman’s argument, the individual understood as a sincere speaking subject; Keane 2007; Robbins 2001<italic>a</italic>). Jon Bialecki (2014), in his contribution, traces this same kind of process of critical group dissolution and reformation, understanding it as rooted in Christian tendencies to endorse ideals that can never be fully realized, hence leaving room at all times for internal critique (Niebuhr 1957 [1929] is a key reference for both Handman and Bialecki in this regard). In a move similar to the one Barker makes of offering the enduring qualities of church institutions as something that can help to define Christianity as an anthropological object across otherwise diverse cases, Bialecki suggests that one task for the anthropology of Christianity in the future is to explore how schism-generating attempts to realize Christian ideals within earthly church institutions can be seen as “a continuing [Christian] problem, one that endures and which must always be grappled with anew as circumstances change” (emphasis removed). The study of Christian critique and schism as social processes is thus a promising new area for the development of the anthropology of Christianity beyond its cultural turn.</p>
         <p>As Handman notes, one might think of schism as a fundamentally Protestant social form, and both her own and Bialecki’s articles are focused on Protestant or Protestant-looking charismatic cases. But it is worth noting that perhaps the first work in dialogue with the anthropology of Christianity to take up the study of schism was Douglas Rogers’s (2009) study of Russian Old Believers, a group that long ago broke with Russian Orthodoxy and that is also the focus of Caroline Humphrey’s (2014) exploration of schismatic social processes in her contribution to this issue.<sup>4</sup> In conversation with older work in the anthropology of Christianity on rupture and discontinuity, Humphrey looks at the specificity of Old Believer notions of schism as a kind of change, wrapped up as they are in collective efforts to preserve tradition and to protect the church from a corrupting outside world in thrall to the antichrist. Humphrey considers the respects in which Old Believer practices of schism might further provide a viable model of revolution, thereby connecting the study of this kind of Christian social processes with that of other forms of fostering social change and new kinds of group formation not by making very broad general statements about the influence of Christianity on modern political forms but by tracing the interaction of various models of change in situations in which they have historically developed in relationship to one another. As one reviewer of this introduction notes, the points Humphrey and other contributors to this section make indicate ways in which the anthropology of Christianity might contribute even more than it already has to the general study of social movements (see also Shah 2014).</p>
         <p>The move all of the authors in this section make toward studying specifically Christian institutions and social processes is a genuinely new development in the anthropology of Christianity (though it is in some respects foreshadowed by Bielo’s [2009] important study of the Bible study group as an important evangelical social institution). It is likely that this move will not be enough to satisfy those critics of the anthropology of Christianity who lament what they see as its culturalist tendencies, for in most cases (though perhaps not fully in Hann’s) it stops short of privileging political and economic forces, understood as in no significant way shaped by religion, as the sole or only really important historical influences on the ways in which Christianity has developed and on the ways Christian people live their lives. But even if the anthropology of Christianity turns out to be no better suited than any other anthropological trend to date of serving as an arena for settling the conflicts between cultural and materialist understandings that beset the discipline, the turn represented here toward attending to Christian social institutions as a crucial area of study will undoubtedly enrich the anthropology of Christianity as it moves forward.</p>

         <title>Christianity, Space, and Place</title>
         <p>Almost from the outset, anthropologists of Christianity attended to the various ways in which Christian groups figure time, both eschatologically and in the before and after rhythms of conversion (e.g., Robbins 2001<italic>b</italic>; Schieffelin 2002). By comparison, there has been less work explicitly focused on issues of space. The articles in this section fill this gap. In doing so, they also carry forward some of the institutional and political concerns of the articles discussed above, indicating that perhaps the shift to focusing on such issues is becoming something of a general one.</p>
         <p>Bambi Schieffelin’s (2014) article looks at how Christian Bosavi of Papua New Guinea have learned to deploy new linguistic resources in ways that remake traditional notions of place. Concerned with mapping new centers and peripheries within the Bosavi world and with sorting those converts who dwell in the center from those who remain on the periphery, Bosavi Christians pepper their speech with forms that index a new sociospatial reality, one profoundly disconnected from the densely relational traditional Bosavi landscape. In effect, Schieffelin shows us the microlinguistic machinery that renders socially effective the kind of critique to which Handman and Bialecki drew our attention. As Schieffelin herself puts it, the new ways of speaking she charts attest to the ways “critical embodied practices … can lead the charge toward discontinuity” by enacting a schismatic break from traditional sociality.</p>
         <p>Andreas Bandak (2014) and Jianbo Huang (2014) each look at urban situations in many respects far removed from the rural world of the Bosavi. Although anthropologists of Christianity have long worked in both rural and urban settings, little has been done to consider systematically the differences and similarities that mark the way Christianity is lived across this sociospatial divide. In this respect, it is intriguing that one does find some similarities in the place-making practices of the Bosavi and those discussed by Bandak and Huang. Bandak concentrates on the ways minority Catholic and Orthodox Christians in Damascus inhabit urban space. Drawing on Deleuze’s notion of the refrain, he examines how insistent, oft-repeated ways of appearing in space, through such means as song, visual display, and religious architecture, render the city a setting for competing religious territorializations. He also attends to the varying identities and spatial spans Damascene Christians work to territorialize as they sometimes foreground their place as members of the Syrian nation while at others stressing their Christian minority status. In relation to the new maps Bosavi Christians work to install, Schieffelin notes that by speaking in terms of them “enough times, Christians hoped to produce a new social reality.” The insistent quality of their efforts echoes the repetitive quality of the Damascene Christians’ refrains. In both places, Christians work diligently to claim their earthly space.</p>
         <p>The conjunction of Schieffelin and Bandak’s arguments about the repetitive, interactive nature of earthly place making provides a good opportunity to pause to take up an issue that is relevant to many of the articles in this collection, as well as to the anthropology of Christianity more generally. There has been some concern among critics of the anthropology of Christianity that many of the topics that it deals with are not specific to Christian populations. Hann (2014), who has made such arguments before, reprises them in his contribution to this volume. This is quite obviously true in relation to these two articles about space. Bandak (2014), who is drawing on a Deleuzian model of refrains that is itself phrased in universal terms, states explicitly that “my argument is not that refrains are Christian per se.” Furthermore, he documents Islamic as well as Christian practices of refrain making in his article. Schieffelin (2014), for her part, builds her article around a very subtle argument about the role of general language socialization and linguistic practices in bringing about cultural change. Like other contributions to this issue, neither of these authors is making an argument only about Christianity. But it is also the case that both Bandak and Schieffelin are attending carefully to the way the general processes they are examining are lived out by Christians and the ways these processes are inflected by the Christian concerns of those that are undertaking them. Surely, this is enough to render their contributions important to the study of Christianity, as well as to the general anthropology of space and of language. One would not want to set the search for Christian uniqueness as the only or even the primary goal of every contribution to the anthropology of Christianity.</p>
         <p>Yet having made this point, it bears noting that in Huang’s (2014) article in this section we also find a hint of a very characteristically if not uniquely Christian reason why space making might be a key concern for members of many Christian churches. Huang’s focus is on Chinese churches that cater primarily to recent urban migrants from the countryside. By means of the phrase “rural churches in the city,” he quite elegantly captures the complexity of the sociospatial location of these churches. Both in their membership, which is predominantly made up of migrants, and in their style of Christian worship, which Huang characterizes as more emotionally than intellectually oriented, these churches remain “rural” even as they help their members adapt to life in urban settings. But one of the things the churches offer their members in this latter regard is a second map of meaningful space that competes with the urban/rural one that so clearly shapes their experience. This is a map of earth and heaven, in which life on earth is transitory and lacks ultimate importance compared to that in heaven. Bosavi Christians work with this kind of map as well. It is an ordering of space that throws into relief the relative and ultimately fragile nature of the earthly spatial order, even as it makes inhabiting space appropriately on earth a key salvational goal. By contrast, the heaven/earth mapping does not appear to figure very importantly for the Damascene Christians Bandak discusses, or at least not in the account he offers here. Preoccupied as they are with their earthly minority status and perhaps also influenced by the theologies of the locally relevant Orthodox and Catholic churches to which they belong, their space-making efforts appear to be very terrestrially focused. Given that the heaven/earth map is not equally relevant to all Christians, studying why it is sometimes central and at other times peripheral to their space-making concerns is precisely the kind of comparative question the anthropology of Christianity is well positioned both to uncover and to seek to answer (Robbins 2009).</p>

         <title>Christianity and Gender</title>
         <p>It is fair to say that with the exception of the pioneering work of the two contributors to this section, the study of gender has not been central to the anthropology of Christianity thus far (Eriksen 2008; Mayblin 2010). This is somewhat unexpected, inasmuch as the relationship between conversion and changing gender roles, particularly in Latin America, was one area in which anthropologists had begun to focus squarely on Pentecostalism before the development of the anthropology of Christianity, making this a particularly rich area for what I referred to in footnote 3 as systematic work on the “prehistory” of the anthropology of Christianity (e.g., Austin-Broos 1997; Brusco 1995; Cucchiari 1990). But regardless of the surprising nature of this neglect, the articles in this section move decisively beyond it.</p>
         <p>Both Annelin Eriksen (2014) and Maya Mayblin (2014) characterize much of the earlier literature on Christianity and gender, including that referred to above, as primarily concerned with sociological issues such as the nature of gender identities and the way they determine persons’ abilities to assume leadership and public roles within various churches. In their contributions here, Eriksen and Mayblin largely set aside such issues and instead look at how notions of gender difference are fundamental to Pentecostal and Catholic Christian cosmologies. They both consider, that is to say, what Eriksen phrases as “the way Christianity … itself is gendered.”</p>
         <p>Eriksen’s article is focused on Pentecostal-charismatic churches in urban Vanuatu. The Pentecostal tradition, as she points out, has long been marked by a contradiction between its strenuous affirmation that all believers are equal before God, a point driven home by the fact that all are at least potentially able to receive gifts of the Holy Spirit, and the fact that church leaders tend to be men. More than this, Eriksen argues, Pentecostal moral transformation itself is a practice that is gendered male, not in the sense that only men achieve such transformation but in that working toward it is a male way of behaving regardless of the gender of the person who undertakes such work. Yet despite these gendered distinctions, in normative Pentecostal rhetoric, all such differences are “denied” or “submerged” in favor of egalitarian understandings of Christian belonging. The tension such denials foster often comes to the fore in what Eriksen defines as the “charismatic space” in which Pentecostal men and woman both interact with the Holy Spirit. Men and women, she demonstrates with her Vanuatu material, engage with the Holy Spirit differently: men “encounter” the Spirit in ways that foster their individual capacities for leadership and institution building, while women “mediate” the Spirit’s powers in possession episodes that efface their individuality and further embed them in relational networks. But the charismatic space does not just provide a stage on which otherwise denied gendered differences can be expressed through these different kinds of engagement. It also allows the differences themselves to be challenged by those who endeavor to manage the encounters in unusual ways. To illustrate this point, Eriksen presents the case of Sarah, an excommunicated woman who attempts to fuse male and female aspects of charisma in an attempt to address her situation. That Sarah’s efforts to restore herself to church membership ultimately fail indicate the difficulties of challenging the public, normative Pentecostal gender order but also illustrate that there are charismatic resources available for doing so.</p>
         <p>Maya Mayblin’s (2014) article, based both on fieldwork among Catholics in northeastern Brazil and on the study of Catholic theological and ecclesiological debates, also attests to the fluidity of Christian understandings of gender, though in a church in which such fluidity is publicly important rather than submerged. At the heart of Mayblin’s analysis is a consideration of the key problem presented by the fact that the sacred must always be in some proximity to the profane world in order for its influence to be felt, while it must also maintain enough distance from that world to be able to claim a power that is uniquely its own (see Hubert and Mauss 1964 for a classic statement of this problem). In the Catholic tradition, Mayblin demonstrates, proximity tends to be managed in part by stressing the anthropomorphic aspects of divine figures such as Jesus, Mary, and the saints. Such anthropomorphism is present throughout the Christian tradition, she notes, but it is especially well developed in its Catholic branch. Having fostered proximity in this way, the church manages distance through a complicated “gymnastic” play with issues of divine gender that render it always at least potentially different from human forms. Working carefully through such topics as the gender of saints, clerical celibacy, theological arguments over the status of Mary’s hymen, and debates about the possibility of allowing women to become deacons, Mayblin demonstrates the ways in which gender ambiguity both helps protect the distinctiveness of the sacred and shapes very concrete earthly struggles over the appropriate ways for human men and women to live.</p>
         <p>As both Eriksen and Mayblin note, the two articles in this section are in productive dialogue with each other in ways that open up new possibilities for comparing Pentecostalism and Catholicism as forms of Christianity. To borrow a point Eriksen makes, though phrasing it slightly differently than she does: it is as if the social fluidity of Pentecostalism, allied with its official denial of the importance of gender difference, leads to the use of the charismatic space as a relatively submerged forum for the articulation of different gender values in the pursuit of sacred efficacy, while in the more comfortably hierarchical Catholic case spiritual elaboration tends to work toward forms of androgyny and gender ambiguity in its efforts to produce the power of the divine. More generally, these two very rich articles indicate in compelling terms the promise of moving forward with the project of making the study of gender far more central to the anthropology of Christianity than it has been in the past.</p>

         <title>The Anthropology of Christianity on the Boundaries of Christianity and Beyond</title>
         <p>Most work in the anthropology of Christianity has focused on Christians. On the face of things, this must appear to be a statement that is too obvious to need making. But in fact it is capable of being nuanced in some interesting ways. To begin with, most work in the anthropology of Christianity has been based on research with people who themselves claim to be Christians rather than with people who are defined as such by anthropologists in the absence of their possession of a self-conscious Christian identity of their own. More than this, this research has been carried out primarily among people who at least in their own terms (which differ quite a bit between various Christian traditions) define themselves as committed Christians rather than simply as people who live in communities in which Christianity is the dominant religion but see themselves as largely indifferent in matters of religion. So much work had to be done early on in the anthropology of Christianity to ward off the claim that this or that group might look Christian in some respects but is best understood as not genuinely Christian, that those wanting to contribute to the development of this area of study tended to pick quite firmly and vocally Christian populations for study (Robbins 2007). But now that the anthropological impulse to analyze away the Christianity of the people anthropologists study has been largely stilled, there is room to ask what the anthropology of Christianity might learn from research on ambivalent or only tenuously committed Christians or on groups of people who are not Christian but define themselves in important respects in relation to Christianity (Robbins 2010). The articles in this section all explore aspects of this kind of project.</p>
         <p>In a wide-ranging article that poses Pentecostalism and pilgrimage as contrasting tropes for the anthropology of Christianity, Simon Coleman (2014) focuses his ethnography on pilgrims to the English site of Walsingham. The pilgrim to whom he devotes the most attention is a woman he refers to as Donna, someone who is “a relatively disengaged, agnostic” Anglican and is married to a lapsed Catholic but who still goes on pilgrimages to Walsingham with her extended family. She finds these trips meaningful, both in terms of the familial sociality they foster and because of the relationship of this sociality to forms of ritual that she finds moving, though not necessarily in a religious sense. Donna’s form of what Coleman calls “semi-engagement” with “trivial ritual” raises, as he notes, questions not only of who and what is a Christian but also of when and where in social life these kinds of questions might arise. One catches a glimpse here of the way the study of Christians like Donna can help to reframe still unsettled debates within an anthropology of Christianity over how to determine who, for purposes of anthropological study, ought meaningfully to be counted as Christian (Bialecki 2012; Garriott and O’Neill 2008; Robbins 2003<italic>c</italic>).</p>
         <p>In contrast to Coleman’s contribution, Matthew Engelke’s (2014) article takes up the case of a group that is vocally non-Christian. The British Humanist Association (BHA) is an explicitly secularist group, but inasmuch as it understands its primary religious antagonist to be Christianity, it is profoundly engaged with some of the same issues that preoccupy many of the Christians anthropologists study. For example, the lives of BHA members turn out to raise a host of fascinating questions about continuity, discontinuity, and secularity that Engelke explores in depth, noting how they upend some by now taken for granted assumptions in the anthropology of Christianity. Using the BHA’s militant secularity as a mirror, for example, Engelke shows that the assertion made by some anthropologists of Christianity that Christianity must be understood as cultural stands, very much in spite of itself, as itself a strongly secular claim by virtue of its implication that Christianity is something other than a universal truth. BHA practice is also surprising in its members’ interest in ritual, a form of social action they work to wedge free from Christianity, and from religion more generally, and to put to their own uses. Like Donna in Coleman’s article, ritual holds some attraction for BHA members but only when it is shorn of its theological encumbrances. There is room here to develop in new ways the exploration anthropologists of Christianity have already begun to carry out of the varying attitudes toward ritual that exist within different branches of the Christian tradition (Lindhardt 2011; Pfeil 2011), setting BHA and more gently secularist attitudes such as Donna’s within an examination of the way Christianity has historically shaped and continues to influence Western notions of ritual and of religion more generally.</p>
         <p>If Donna might be described as sort of Christian, but not very much, while the BHA members that Engelke studies might count as very much not Christian, but in somewhat Christian terms, the practitioners of the Vietnamese religion Caodai that are the focus of Janet Hoskins’s (2014) contribution confound completely our usual terms of deciding matters of inclusion in and exclusion from the analytical category “Christian.” Caodai is a syncretistic religion that originally arose in conditions of French colonial dominance in Vietnam. Its conditions of origin shaped its religious organization, which is based on a hierarchy of offices modeled on that of the Catholic Church. If one kept rigorously to the suggestion of Barker’s article that one should look at church structures as a key variable in defining Christianity for the purpose of compiling sets of comparable cases across social and denominational divides, one would have to consider the possibility of including Caodai churches in such a grouping. And one might be emboldened in the effort to do so by the fact that Caodai also includes Jesus in its pantheon. But on this point, matters immediately become more complex. For most Coadaists, Jesus is a relatively junior member of their pantheon, “placed three levels below Buddha, Lao Tzu, and Confucius” (though he has been moved up somewhat in one North American Caodai temple). Jesus’s primary importance appears to be his quality as a nationalist opponent of Roman imperialism, seen as providing a model for Vietnamese resistance to the French, who within the Caodai pantheon finds himself “incorporated into a more encompassing spiritual vision.”</p>
         <p>A key aspect of Hoskins’s article turns on what work in the anthropology of Christianity might offer her in analyzing a religious tradition that is not itself Christian. In this respect, she plays off of various analyses of the Christian contribution to the formation of Western modernity to good effect, and her overall approach to the study of Caodai syncretism bears marks of demands anthropologists of Christianity have made for a more sophisticated handling of this topic. But her work makes contributions to the anthropology of Christianity as well. Not least among these is raising in very direct terms the question of who absolutely cannot be counted as a Christian. As she puts it, the Caodai case indicates that Christians must maintain “an exclusive commitment to keeping Christian figures at the top of the pantheon, not messing things up with other religious teachers.” Her article confronts us with the fact that similarities in church institutional structure do not outweigh or obviate this requirement: institutional structure, regardless of “cultural” content, may not be enough to define Christianity as a topic for comparison after all.</p>
         <p>During the early years of the anthropology of Christianity, there was some worry that the diversity of the Christian tradition would sink any effort to shape up Christianity as an object of cross-cultural research. Surely there is no such thing as Christianity, many were inclined to argue, but only Christianities. Given this, why compare one form of Christianity with another rather than comparing a Christian case with one involving any other religious tradition and perhaps even with one involving another religious tradition that has the further advantage of being geographically or “socioculturally” nearby to the Christian case under consideration (Robbins 2003<italic>c</italic>)? The facts that the articles in this issue range widely across the vast and varied landscape of Christian traditions, from Orthodoxy and Catholicism to mainline Protestantism and Pentecostalism, and that the articles in this section turn their attention to cases at or clearly beyond the edges of Christianity itself, indicate that Christian diversity is not, as it turns out, a potentially fatal challenge to the anthropology of Christianity, at least not at its current level of maturity. Learning to make the most of such diversity analytically will be a major challenge for the anthropology of Christianity as it continues to develop.</p>

         <title>Reconsidering Key Topics in the Anthropology of Christianity</title>
         <p>In designing the conference that produced this issue, I wanted to make space for a number of scholars to address some of the key topics that have marked work in the anthropology of Christianity from its inception. I have saved discussion of the articles that take up such topics for the penultimate section of this introduction first because I worried that addressing them at the beginning might give the impression that in their content the papers were somehow “old fashioned” and as such should be seen as superseded by the articles that would then have followed them. In fact, these papers are as innovative as any in the volume. But more than this, and this is a second reason for saving discussion of them for last, they point to some aspects of the future of the anthropology of Christianity that do not appear as clearly in the articles I have already discussed. Topically, these articles deal with issues of reflexivity, discontinuity and change, materiality, and experience. I had also hoped to include articles on two other topics that had long been central to the anthropology of Christianity. One of these would have been on transcendence, but the scholar invited to address this topic was unable to attend the conference. The other would have been on individualism, a topic for which in the end there was no space to invite someone. I have recently reviewed work on these two topics within the anthropology of Christianity extensively in another place, and I hope that piece might make up somewhat for the absence of articles focused on these two topics here (Robbins 2012). It is clear that both of these subjects, along with those that are discussed in the articles in this section, will continue to be central to the anthropology of Christianity in the future.</p>
         <p>From early on, anthropologists of Christianity have explored the extent to which some kinds of Christianity, particularly its Evangelical and Pentecostal branches, promote radical discontinuity in the lives of converts—demanding that they reject their former cultural commitments and ways of living. Work continues in this area and routinely brings the anthropology of Christianity into dialogue with developments elsewhere in the discipline, as is the case in recent discussions of discontinuity in relation to ethics, pedagogy, and state projects of cultural management (Brahinsky 2013; Chua 2012; Daswani 2013). This tradition of work also figures importantly in relation to schism, revolution, and language in Handman’s (2014), Humphrey’s (2014), and Schieffelin’s (2014) contributions to this issue. Aparecida Vilaça’s (2014) article in this issue focuses squarely on issues of discontinuity, and she works through a range of issues related to debates on this topic with exemplary analytic care. The Amazonian Wari’ with whom Vilaça has carried out long-term fieldwork have been exposed to both Catholic and Evangelical missionization. Vilaça explores not only the differences in how the two missions have approached issues of change, and particularly their views on fostering discontinuity with traditional cultural notions, but also the way in which Catholic approaches to issues of discontinuity have themselves changed in the wake of the Second Vatican Council. Furthermore, she notes that the traditional perspectivism of the Wari’, and their allied interest in incorporating the foreign, also outfits them with a complex indigenous model of discontinuous change that shapes their engagement with the varied Christian models they have encountered (Vilaça 2009). Looking at the play of these various models of change over time, and tracking in particular how these models have shaped developing Wari’ views of the inner self as well as of culture, Vilaça productively complicates simplistic claims about the effects of Christian discontinuity even as she reaffirms the productivity of research in this area.</p>
         <p>From their earliest framings, discussions of discontinuity in the anthropology of Christianity have also had a reflexive component, challenging cultural anthropology as a discipline that has to an important extent been preoccupied with the study of continuity (Robbins 2003<italic>b</italic>, 2007). Ruth Marshall’s (2014) contribution also takes up these two issues in tandem. As Marshall notes, she is a political scientist with a strong grounding in political theory rather than an anthropologist. Although she does not state this as explicitly, it is also worth noting that she has carried out extensive fieldwork among Nigerian Pentecostals and has, on the basis of this research, profoundly challenged the ways social scientists, including anthropologists, have thought about Pentecostal politics (Marshall 2009). In her article here, Marshall develops her reflexive interrogation of both political theory and the anthropology of Christianity through a focus on, among other things, the theme of discontinuity. Questioning how an emphasis on the Pentecostal drive for rupture with the past puts currently fashionable notions of ontology to the test, she asks whether the way an anthropological focus on Christianity upends traditional disciplinary investments in studying the other rather than the self, or the different rather than the similar, might also ground a shift from an anthropological politics of self-determination to one of equality. More generally, she insists that anthropologists of Christianity recognize their own attempts to define Christianity as an object of study as being political as well as epistemological practices and ones that potentially have wider disciplinary and broader worldly implications than their reflexive considerations have previously registered.</p>
         <p>Like discontinuity and reflexivity, religious understandings of materiality have also been a central topic in the anthropology of Christianity from the beginning. Webb Keane’s 2007 book <italic>Christian Moderns: Freedom and Fetish in the Mission Encounter</italic> has been enormously influential in setting the terms of debate in this area. Through a sustained analysis of conflicts between Eastern Indonesian “ancestral ritualists” and Dutch Calvinist missionaries over the status of material items (including institutionalized social forms) in religious practice, in this book Keane develops the important concept of semiotic ideologies and specifies one Protestant version of such an ideology that worked toward the ultimately impossible goal of defining away the material and routinized qualities of signs and their use. In his article here, Keane (2014) revisits the notion of semiotic ideology, cross pollinating it with the notion of material affordances and expanding it through a close analysis of materials from Russian Orthodox and Soviet Atheist materials. The outcome of his argument not only further attests to the value of semiotic ideology as a framework for comparing different kinds of Christianity but also opens up a whole new line of research into the ethical stakes that Keane shows here so often attend debates about the spiritual and the material in the Christian tradition (and by implication in other religious traditions as well). As with recent discussions of discontinuity mentioned above (especially Daswani 2013), his argument successfully joins the anthropology of Christianity to burgeoning anthropological debates about the nature of morality.</p>
         <p>Tanya Luhrmann’s (2014) article, written with Julia Cassaniti (a psychological anthropologist and scholar of Thai Buddhism), takes up the topic of religious experience, a subject that has received a great deal of attention in the early anthropology of Christianity, particularly from those studying Pentecostal and charismatic Christians (who highly value experiences of encounter with the Holy Spirit). Building on this tradition of work, Luhrmann and Cassaniti go on to ask very general questions about the origin and nature of spiritual experience not only in Christianity but also in all religious traditions. They develop a model of “cultural kindling” in which cultural emphases tied to various religious traditions lead people to attend differently to universally available bodily and psychological phenomena that can be taken as indications of the presence of the supernatural. Primed differently by the traditions in which they participate, people take different (or none) of these stimuli as evidence of supernatural forces and elaborate this evidence into different cosmological models. Comparing charismatic Christians in the United States and Theravada Buddhists in Thailand, they show how this model allows for comparison between religious traditions and sketch how it can provide a basis for comparison between branches of the Christian tradition as well.</p>
         <p>Both Keane’s and Luhrmann and Cassaniti’s articles draw on ideas that have been developed in anthropological work on Christianity and on kinds of data anthropologists have collected or learned to identify through such work. But both of them develop arguments of very general ambition—aiming to tie together the meaningful, the material, and the ethical in Keane’s case and to provide a scientific basis for accounting for religious diversity in Luhrmann’s and Cassaniti’s. Vilaça similarly demonstrates the sophistication with which anthropologists of Christianity have come to approach issues of continuity and discontinuity that they have shown are of very broad relevance to anthropological theory more generally. By reviving the tie between the anthropology of Christianity’s interest in discontinuity and its reflexive impulse, Marshall (2014) is also able to register the potential impact of these features of the field on much broader disciplinary and transdisciplinary debates. All of the articles in this section on “traditional” topics in the anthropology of Christianity thus spill well beyond the limits of the subfield that gave them birth. Of course, the hope has from the outset been that work in the anthropology of Christianity would not be relevant only to the study of Christianity. It is nice to see that ambition so obviously realized in the articles in this section. The fact that the implications of these articles so clearly reach beyond the anthropology of Christianity raises the question of the future of this field—a question I will take up briefly in conclusion.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>What, then, should be the future of the anthropology of Christianity? It would of course be an act of tremendous hubris to try to answer this question very directly. But perhaps it makes sense in closing to suggest some ways in which the question might be discussed. One thing that is clear is that Christianity will continue to be a major topic of anthropological research for the foreseeable future and this to an extent it simply was not before. But as ethnographic studies of Christianity continue to appear in ever greater numbers, should the anthropological study of Christianity continue to unfold as part of a self-conscious project of intellectual community building that aims to push anthropologists who study different kinds of Christianity and/or who study Christianity in different regions of the world to see their research as mutually relevant? And should the heightened disciplinary self-consciousness that has been a part of the anthropology of Christianity since its inception remain important no matter what direction it goes next?</p>
         <p>In the introduction to this article I suggested that in terms of disciplinary history it might come as a surprise if the answer to either of these questions were to be yes. More often in sociocultural anthropology, new foci of interest arise and generate excitement for a number of years, but by middle age they begin to fade, becoming at best a taken for granted part of the background of anthropological work rather than remaining in the foreground even of their former core supporters’ concern. On the evidence of this issue, however, there may well be some cause for keeping the focused conversation that has been the anthropology of Christianity to this point going a little bit longer. So many of the arguments of these articles are decidedly new ones, and they address issues that have been neglected in earlier work in the field. Even the articles that take up longer-standing themes push them in novel directions and draw out their importance for anthropology in general. And part of what makes all of the articles distinctive is that they engage with each other and with work that has been done in and around the anthropology of Christianity in the past. Such at least has been the argument of this introduction. It is an argument that drives toward the conclusion that the anthropology of Christianity has good reason, even in academic middle age, to continue to look toward the future.</p>
