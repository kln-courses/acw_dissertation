<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letters BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION Arnold B. Grobman is quite correct in citing the importance of science education and in calling for a coordinated effort to improve science education in our schools (October 1984 Bioscience 34: 551-557). The complex problems that confront the world today require a corps of highly trained profes- sionals and a scientifically competent public. I object, however, when this issue is framed in terms of economic or military competition between the United States and other nations. We need not haul out the specters of a declin- ing standard of living, a faltering economy, and military impotence to argue very persua- sively in favor of heightened support for sci- ence education. It is true that "we do not, most unfortunate- ly, live in a world where peaceful coexistence is assured" (p. 556). However, the well-being of life on earth will not be furthered through additional efforts to stock this nation's de- fense industry with scientists prepared to de- sign a new generation of weapons. The politi- cal, social, and environmental problems that face humankind are global in nature and will only be solved through international cooper- ation. As an influential member of the interna- tional community, the United States has a special obligation to direct its vast resources toward the peaceful solution of these prob- lems. It is only through a strong program of science education that the citizens of this country will be able to make the hard deci- sions that must be made in the coming years. This, I believe, is a more appropriate argu- ment for a renewed dedication to science education. STEVE FIFIELD Department of Ecology and Behavioral Biology University of Minnesota Minneapolis, MN 55455 STRATEGY: MISUSE OR INSIGHT? When teaching introductory biology at the undergraduate level, we try to be sure our students understand a number of messages. Two of the most important are simple and straightforward. First, we remind them that biology, like all disciplines, has a language of its own and that the vocabulary of that lan- guage must be mastered if the subject itself is to be mastered. Second, we stress that there is no substitute for clear and critical reason- ing. Paul Kramer, who criticizes the use of the term strategy in the ecological literature (July/ August 1984 BioScience 34: 405), seems to have forgotten these two lessons. Kramer presents three related attacks on this term: the concept of a strategy is both teleological and anthropomorphic because, given the dic- tionary definition of strategy, foresight and planning in anticipation of future events is a cornerstone of a successful strategy; use of the term results in careless thinking and writ- ing; and its occurrence is misleading to non- scientists. We would like to make a brief rebuttal to each of these points and then advocate the continued use of this convenient term. The definition offered in a nontechnical dictionary, regardless of its quality, should be of little concern to research or teaching biolo- gists. The vocabulary of all scientific disci- plines is replete with terms that have technical and nontechnical meanings (e.g., niche, guild, and fitness in evolutionary biology). The word selection, for example, used in an evolution- ary context, does not imply any conscious choice on the part of the agents of natural selection. It is thus unreasonable to measure the scientific merit of a term using Webster's yardstick. The correct question to ask in the present situation is: Does continued use of the term strategy provide any insight for evolu- tionary biologists? As biologists who research and teach about strategies in both animals and plants, our answer is a resounding yes. Use of the term strategy and the concepts it embodies is valuable to biologists, for it re- minds us of the dichotomy between proximate and ultimate causation. Kramer uses the re- sponses of plants to water stress to illustrate a situation where he finds the strategy concept irrelevant and misleading. But Kramer ap- pears to be focusing entirely on short-term, proximate effects. Such proximate responses of plants to water stress include changes in leaf size and anatomy and changes in root/ shoot ratio. These changes might decrease the probability of death during a drought, thereby increasing the fitness of phenotypes able to respond appropriately to moisture stress. The ultimate response of a plant population to repeated drought might, therefore, be evolu- tion of a set of water stress-tolerating charac- teristics, i.e., a strategy. To reject this term effectively confines us to the study of proximate responses, with little concern for the integrated activities of the whole organism or for the coevolution of adaptive characteristics. Strategy, when used correctly, implies nothing about planning or foresight but rather describes the long-term evolution of a particular phenotype. When misused, the term surely might become a haven for sloppy thinking and writing. It would probably be incorrect, for example, to assume that every phenotypic trait was im- portant enough for natural selection to oper- ate on it directly. The possibility of misuse, however, should not discourage biologists from continuing to use this term. When placed in its proper biological context, strategy should not be considered either teleological or anthropo- morphic by any evolutionary biologist. Kra- mer is quite correct when he says that this term may be misunderstood by nonscientists. We suspect, however, that most of the techni- cal literature in all disciplines would not be fully appreciated by nonspecialists. The point to keep in mind is that an author must always be aware of his/her audience. When writing for a general readership, great care must be taken to ensure that terms are defined in a way that reduces the possibility of confusion from overlapping vocabularies. While creat- ing jargon should always be avoided, coining terms for important concepts furthers scien- tific progress by improving communication and encapsulating complex ideas simply and conveniently.
