<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUMAN PURPOSE AND COSMIC PURPOSE W HOEVER would discuss the topic of purpose in the contem- porary philosophical context must take account of a signifi- cant shift of emphasis in recent dealing with these questions. I refer to the fact that the older alternative, purpose versus mecha- nism, has given rise to a newer opposition, posed most persuasively by Nicolai Hartmann, between human purpose and cosmic purpose. To put it in his own words, this is the view that "teleology is the peculiarity of human nature," 1 involving both the affirmation of the autonomy of man and the denial, on the ground that it is in- compatible with such autonomy, of cosmic teleology. To continue with Hartmann: 2 A choice must be made between a teleology of nature and existence in general, and a teleology of man. The alternative is a complete and genuine disjunction. . . . On one side of the alternative stands a theory; on the other, a phenomenon . . . a philosopher . . . must give up teleological metaphysics in favor of the ethical phenomenon. This clearly means that if "purpose" be granted at the cosmic level it follows that purpose at the human level is not purpose at all but action cosmically determined, rendering such purposive phenomena as men fondly believe in either evanescent or downright illusory. So the theory must go; the ethical phenomenon must remain. It is a two-sided criticism which humanists like Hartmann make of the notion of cosmic purpose. There is a logical attack on the "anthropomorphism" involved in generalizing about the universe from the limited human perspective; and there is an ethical protest against the disappearance of such genuine human data as freedom, foresight, and intention in the delusive solvent of cosmic teleology. Though these two modes of argument are not often kept apart in humanist exposition, we shall here distinguish them, asking then what constructive statement of the relation between human and cosmic purpose may validly be set forth. 1 Hartmann, Ethics, I, p. 282. 2 Ibid., I, p. 288.</page><page sequence="2">HUMAN PURPOSE AND COSMIC PURPOSE 657 I The logical objection to the notion of cosmic teleology seems to involve three matters: the meaning (denotative and connotative) of the term "purpose," the use of analogy as the conceptual bridge between human and cosmic spheres of discourse, and the apparent anthropomorphism which weights the scales of honest inquiry in favor of human preferences and pretensions. From the naturalist quarter it is continually urged that "pur- pose" is highly ambiguous and tends to be used in a vaguely honorific rather than in a precisely descriptive sense. What is necessary, says the naturalist, is an analysis of the term into em- pirically verifiable entities and processes. Such analysis is doubly useful: it avoids the psychologist fallacy by which psychological data are read into the natural order, and it reduces purpose to a level of facts and relationships manageable by the methods and hypothetical structures of natural science. Behaviorism, Dewey's "naturalization of the intelligence," and Perry's "interest-theory of value" are familiar examples of such attempts. There can be little doubt that teleologists have to answer to the charges of ambiguity and honorific vagueness. There is clearly no reason why purposes should be by nature good. They may be, and indeed often are, vicious, blundering, or stupid. But they are still purposes. To show that a man is characterized by purpose action does not demonstrate his native goodness; and to suggest that na- ture is purposive in its adaptations and organic relatedness is still a long step from proving the goodness of God. To establish pur- pose in either sense is plainly no justification of optimism. It is merely to establish the possibility of action aimed at ends which may be either good or bad. Granted that analysis of "purpose" is sorely needed, yet the task is difficult and demands caution. Purpose is one of those "middle-sized facts," to use Pepper's phrase, which belong essen- tially to the human sphere. The persistent error of the naturalist is to reduce purpose to the status of verifiable entities and processes, cortical, thalamic, endocrine, motor, etc., a procedure in which pur- pose itself inevitably disappears. What takes place here is often not analytical reduction at all but simple substitution of one set of naturalistic concepts for the purposive phenomena with which one began. One can not, of course, know too much about physiological and neurological conditioning of purposive action; but one must continue to think in terms of total behavioral contexts at the human level if he wishes to explain the phenomenon and not merely to ex- plain it away. There is a sound insistence in the phenomenological</page><page sequence="3">658 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY method of Scheler, Hartmann, and K6hler upon the necessity of keeping the phenomenon in view, which may be accepted as a methodological principle without swallowing the dogma of pseudo- objectivity frequently accompanying it. Discussion of purpose necessarily starts at, and refers back to, the level of total human behavioral contexts. In attempting definition of such a "middle-sized fact" we must appeal to introspection. We know about purpose primarily from our own behavior. It meets us there most frequently as intention, which we use in the double meaning of "what is intended" and "intending." There is a third meaning, nearer to common-sense usage, in which intention is the starting-point of an action, is its "motive. " The three refer to aspects of purposive behavior which are not precisely isolable either in thought or action, but stand for different ways of looking at the same sort of living. Human ac- tions are facts, observable and concrete. We find, primarily on introspection of our own activity but also occasionally on inspection of that of others, that action always occurs with reference to an aim. Some actions are aimed less clearly and it may be less worthily than others, but aim and action stand in inextricable inter- relation. This is a postulate of biological science as well as of human effort. No one has been clearer on this point than Thomas Aquinas, who showed that whatever acts, acts for an end, and that such ends are particular and definite, being constituted by the very being whose ends they are and whose activity is thereby modified. This intentional view of human action is inclusive not only of rele- vant bodily factors but also of contextual organic and valuational factors referring to the total human situation at the moment of analysis. Intention involves a starting-point, an aim, and a pres- ent process, all interdependent; and this is what, at the human level, we here take purpose to mean. Philosophical discussion has made much of the future reference in present human behavior, and psychological investigation and theory have emphasized the origins of that behavior in motivations derived from the past. A full account of human purpose must, however, include both ground and goal of present action. When one asks the question "Why?" about a human act he means not simply " For what end? " but " From what motive? " St. Thomas 's ego ipsemet, that the end of an agent's action is the agent himself, as well as Whitehead's recent category of "feeling" according to which "an actual entity feels as it does feel in order to be the actual entity which it is, " 3 are reminders of this ineradicable "itubiective aim" in intentional action. 3 Process and Reality, p. 339.</page><page sequence="4">HUMAN PURPOSE AND COSMIC PURPOSE 659 This is a radical departure from some generally accepted notions of modern philosophy. If what is meant by "human teleology" is that action is defined by reference to the end of the process, then human action is not teleological. It is rather intentional, action which is " the realization of the intention in which it has its origin."4 This does not deny that there are goals in human be- havior; it points out rather that such goals actually serve as lures or motives and that, far from having a mere pseudo-existence in the realm of the not-yet, they are in experience directive of its continu- ous course. The considerations of the foregoing paragraphs enforce a sharp distinction between such intimations of purpose gleaned by intro- spection and those deduced or inferred from inspection of behavior external to ourselves. One must not suppose that because the word "purpose" commonly applies to both types of functioning, there- fore the referents are identical or even similar. In the world we see growth, development, adaptiveness, what Kohler calls "re- quiredness. " 5 It looks as if purpose were operative. In ourselves we feel not gradual development but decision, not adaptiveness, but choice. The tree grows, the planet rotates, but human beings act. Human purpose-intention-is immediate in its finality, "an an- ticipatory set of the mind." Unlike cosmic or natural purpose it is not constructed or inferred; it is felt, it is done. This brings up the point about the use of analogy in framing any notion of purpose external to ourselves. If the foregoing argument is substantially correct, analogy is seen to be inescapable. Though such purpose may perhaps be, in ordine essendi, primary and logically prior, it is surely, in ordine cognoscendi, secondary and circumstantial. Outside ourselves, as Kant reminded us, we do not find purpose but purposiveness, consisting not only of a formal concept derived from reflection upon experience, but also of scat- tered bits of evidence which strongly suggest analogies with our own behavior. Analogy is justly regarded with suspicion by logicians. One can not, of course, claim that it yields conclusive proof; but it is possible to indicate, if only in passing, its pervasive and inescapable importance. Just why the likening of natural process at some points to human behavior is labelled an untrustworthy analogy, when the likening of the human mind to the brain of a rat passes as sober science, is something not at all clear. Both are on the analogical level, and in spite of the greater experimental testability of the latter, both are based on the same kind of analogical assump- 4 John Macmurray, The Clue to History, p. 16. 5 W. K6hler, The Place of Value in a World of Facts, passim.</page><page sequence="5">660 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tion. We are constantly under the necessity of treating the less familiar as a complex case of the more familiar, of predicting, "from a study of a number of characteristics which these two have in common, that they will have other as yet unstudied characteristics in common." 6 It is important to recognize that analogy is as in- escapable as it is unreliable and to admit that analogy, under the control of the further logical procedures of analysis and synthesis, is more adequate than any one method alone can be. There are situations in which analogy is the best method we have, inconclusive as it is. Further, there are many instances of the employment of analogy which are disguised as something more definite, as in the words "rough," "smooth," "pliable," etc., applied to the descrip- tion of human personalities, but originating in that of physical qualities of objects. Thus, though we agree with Lotze that there is no proof by analogy,7 we agree also with Mill that it may have the utmost suggestiveness in initiating inquiry leading to more positive conclu- sions.8 We must not claim too much for it, but neither can we do without it in philosophy any more than in science. In this matter of human and cosmic purpose it must be admitted; otherwise there can be discussion merely of successive psychological states. If we admit the radical difference between intention and tele- ology we have a principle with which to curb an over-zealous use of analogical reasoning. We realize that the two sets of facts with which we are dealing are similar only in certain respects, e.g., locomotion, ingestion. These are given empirical data; but we seek causes, and infer, by analogy, "desire," "appetite," or "hunger." Or we note apparent order and adaptiveness in or- ganisms and environment, inferences grounded in our own con- scious efforts at adjustment as well as in observed external data. Paley's cosmic "watchmaker," Robinson Crusoe's "man Friday," are examples of such analogical inference compounded of an inner experience of intention, an outer set of circumstances, and the reference from the one to the other which is frankly analogical. Even if one is to deny cosmic purpose in toto, he makes use of the same principle for negative purposes. We can now deal with the charge that analogy from the human to the non-human is simply anthropomorphism. "Metaphysical personalism," Hartmann calls it, and Korzybski, from the view- point of general semantics, labels it "cosmic legislation." Is not the real motive behind the attempts to conceive of cosmic or natural 6 R. W. Holmes, The Bhyme of Beason, pp. 212-213. 7 Logic, sec. 214. 8 System of Logic, III, xx, 3.</page><page sequence="6">HUMAN PURPOSE AND COSMIC PURPOSE 661 purpose a pragmatic one-to warm the heart and make the universe appear friendly? Surely many of the pronouncements of personalistic idealism and pragmatic humanism justify this charge. But it will bear look- ing at more closely. If it means to assert that in such attempts human preference takes precedence over factual and logical rigor there is much to support it, but if it means that it is necessary, or even possible, to reach an understanding of the world in which man lives by eliminating man and his ways from that world, an absurd sort of philosophical nihilism has been implied. It may be unfortunate that human knowledge must be human but it is obviously true. The ego-centric predicament and the value-centric predicament operate in all knowing as in all doing. Their bound- aries may be specified and defined, but can not be ignored. Clearly such considerations justify neither anthropomorphism nor sub- jectivism. Somewhere between anthropomorphic theism and an- thropocentric humanism there is a tenable position. Otherwise there is simply hurling of charges and calling of names back and forth. Toward such a position at least two important contributions may be mentioned. We may adopt with F. R. Tennant the word "anthropic" to indicate the inescapable perspective and position which being human involves. The conceptions of Existenz and "existential thinking" in the writings of Kierkegaard and more recently in that of Jaspers and Heidegger are extremely important. According to this line of thought thinking starts from the actual life in which the thinker stands, from its inner choices and decisions which are for him the core of reality, and from which he defines his universe. We have accepted here two methodological principles, the ana- logical and the anthropic. The one limits the other. Proper em- ployment of analogy depends on my realizing my inability to get outside my own skin and, conversely, my efforts at self-knowledge involve necessarily analogical explorations into my environment, which in the end is the whole universe from where I stand. Added to logical requirements of consistency and the like, and to necessary regard for empirical fact, these are fundamental for all philo- sophical understanding. They neither prove nor disprove cosmic teleology but are indispensable methods for those who deal with the problem with either end in view. II We come now to consider the ethical protest against the notion of cosmic teleology, made typically by humanists. In this view</page><page sequence="7">662 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the sine qua non of human purpose is freedom. The conscious center of purposeful striving must be self-determined: this is the definition of his freedom. Yet if we postulate cosmic purpose human freedom is abolished and with it human purpose. Morality becomes an illusion. A cosmic teleology is as destructive of human purpose as a cosmic determinism. This denial of cosmic teleology is motivated by a wish to estab- lish the notion of the autonomy of man. Hartmann's humanism is phenomenological and Nietzschean; its bases are clearly stated and its premises honestly followed through. Of it one reviewer, com- menting on the Ethics, said "Hartmann postulates atheism in order to give man the glory." Continuous study of the work confirms this opinion. Hartmann's acceptance of an out-moded mechanistic naturalism, his essence-theory of value, the marked absence of any clinical psychological data, and a persistent postponement of ulti- mate metaphysical issues, indicate his absorption in the human problem per se. We note then the strange feature that this denial of cosmic teleology, which is surely a matter of metaphysics, is not at all argued on metaphysical grounds. "Metaphysics must heed ethics, not ethics metaphysics," 8 Hartmann asserts repeatedly. We must, I think, agree with Hartmann in the sense that moral action can not wait upon theology or metaphysics, for it is precisely the urgency of the moral life that distinguishes it from the contempla- tive. Nevertheless it is through the statement of such over-beliefs that moral action is theoretically justified: "ultimately, no ethical theory can be adequate without the explicit statement of its meta- physical beliefs." 10 In defense of this point it may be urged first that there is the nature of the moral agent himself to be explained. In the ongoing course of his existential, moment-to-moment life, with its multitude of choices, attitudes and actions, he is a paradox. For in actual fact he is less than he ought to be, and knows it, or else he would not properly be an ethical being at all; yet in possibility he must already be all that he ought to be, and know it, or his "responsi- bility" for the actual in terms of the not-yet is an empty phrase. Since ethical theory and moral life assume these propositions to be true they must be examined on their own merits. The question of the relation between actuality and possibility which underlies the notion of responsibility is admittedly metaphysical in orientation and intent. Second, it may be urged that man as moral agent is 9 Ethics, I, p. 291. 10 D. Wald, "Ethics and Metaphysics," Internationat Journal of Ethics, Vol. XLVI (1936), p. 472.</page><page sequence="8">HUMAN PURPOSE AND COSMIC PURPOSE 663 also man-as-such. Why should such a being be a moral agent? The answer must be sought not only in his total behavior, because of which he strives, values, intends, but in its larger context as well, so far as this can be discovered and makes a difference to him. There is a strange confusion involved in the humanist dictum that metaphysics must heed ethics. It is the confusion of moral living with ethical thinking. We do not of course think to live; we live to think. But we think, all the same, and it is about our living that ethical thought is concerned. One's moral living is free and responsible, but "freedom" and "responsibility" confront thought as problems with a metaphysical reference. Ethical theory is not so simple as the mere assertion of assumptions neces- sary to make moral living appear real. And even such assertions are metaphysical as they involve an examination of the senses in which the moral phenomena are said to exist. Ethics, therefore, though it can not wait upon metaphysics, can not do without it. Not only is it true that neither the urgency nor the uniqueness of moral life exempts it from theoretical criticism, but this inability to recognize the genuine difference between practical morality and theoretical ethics leads, in Hartmann, to an easy transfer of prac- tical demands into theoretic presuppositions. It is no defence of the autonomy of man simply to assert his superiority in the world. Even the plain man wants to know if this assertion is true, becom- ing thereby a beginner in metaphysics. It is surely an item in the moral life that one asks what in the world he is and where in the world he stands. It is more honest to recognize the metaphysical orientation of ethical questions at the start than to assert the phe- nomena, discard metaphysics, then smuggle in as much metaphysics as you need to make the phenomena you have chosen plausible (e.g., Hartmann's "ideal sphere" and the "metaphysics of man"). An important aspect of this problem is the fact that the realiza- tion of an intended value is a process not wholly subjective but involving natural conditions. Human purpose presupposes cause- effect relationships in nature, including the bodily organism. If such a purpose is realized, there has occurred a "follow-through" from conceptual envisagement to bodily change, whether of mus- cular co6rdination, vocalization, alternation of position or what not. The point of this is that purposes do act as causes which have effects. Socrates chose to sit in prison when he might have left, and Mr. Coolidge did not choose to run. Natural conditions are at once involved in accounting for moral activity. If the purpose is not realized, then, again, the blockage is a natural fact, or com- plex of such facts. Hartman demonstrates this conclusively. Nor does a doctrine of indeterminism in nature prove moral</page><page sequence="9">664 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY freedom. An over-zealous generalization from Heisenberg's prin- ciple holds that because atomic and sub-atomic behavior seems to be in certain respects indeterminate, therefore human freedom is real.1" This does not at all follow. A human being is not an atom, nor is his behavior atomic. This is another consequence of the reduction- ist fallacy among naturalists which we noted earlier. Chance is amoral and when generalized to include human behavior has the same effect logically which Hartmann laid to cosmic teleology-it nullifies man as moral being. Personal freedom does not require absence of determination in nature; it is something thoroughly different from indeterminism, and, as we have noted above, actually requires at least a partially predictable, therefore determinate, order in nature. What we have been saying in various ways is that moral phe- nomena can not stand alone but refer necessarily to more inclusive metaphysical questions as to their standing and significance in the wholeness of the natural order. For only so can we recognize human purpose as actually determinative for human behavior. But this is not anthropocentrism. It emphasizes that such pur- pose is organic to the world, requiring natural conditions for its fulfilment and meeting them as genuine obstacles. It recognizes further with such scientists as Bavink and Henderson the adap- tiveness and requiredness displayed by patterns and processes in nature as belonging to nature and not to the fictitious "subject" of modern philosophy, impelling analogies by self-conscious beings from their own intentional experiences which make sense of their world in terms of purpose. III It will thus be seen that human purpose and cosmic purpose are, though radically distinct, complementary concepts. Human purpose refers to the phenomenon of intention and is introspec- tively arrived at. It is psychic process, a going-on from motive to consequence which involves not only the complicated mechanisms of conscious deliberation and decision, but also the environing condi- tions which limit or fulfil the intentions of men. Hartmann, be- gilning with a phenomenological analysis of human intention, finds it necessary to posit mechanistic naturalism in order to ac- count for the intentional follow-through into overt consequences. He then is faced with a problem of philosophical juggling; he has a causal series, a finalistic series, and man, who is neither the one nor the other, subject to both, and mediator between them. Only 11 See A. H. Compton, The Freedom of Man.</page><page sequence="10">HUMAN PURPOSE AND COSMIC PURPOSE 665 ambiguity can result. Since he regards cosmic teleology as abol- ishing human intention he has no other choice than to speak of such series, mysteriously "interlaced" and somehow not destruc- tive of one another. We accept his phenomena as genuine data. But such data are also explicanda, to be explained in relation to their contexts. We hold that to accept such phenomena does imply a minimal concept of cosmic teleology, in two senses. The first is that of conditions favorable to intentions, since the environment does support, or at least does not invariably destroy, the intentional modifications of human organisms. The second is that of realized intentions al- ready made fact, since a purpose once attained becomes historic matter-of-fact, leaving its mark on the objective order. It is because we here adopt the view that human purposes act as causes actually modifying the course of natural events, that we accept the notion of cosmic purpose. For intentions are not self-explanatory and they are not merely egocentric. They have their grounds and goals in the world beyond the self and including it. This reference of intention to teleology in the natural order is not merely logical but organic and actual. It is because of the actual interdependence of intention and teleology that there must be conceptual recognition, calling for a notion of cosmic purpose in the minimal sense already indicated. I have called this a "minimal sense." I should not wish to claim that cosmic purpose is acceptable only in so far as human intentions actually affect natural events. I simply wish to point out this neglected aspect of the problem as affording a significant avenue to the cosmic conception. Cosmic purpose may not be ex- hausted in these two concepts. All that is necessary to the present issue is the admission of conditions and consequences of human intention in the natural world. Another reason for minimizing the notion is that when cosmic purpose is generalized to apply to the universe in its totality it is scarcely distinguishable from cosmic determinism. We think of teleology rather in the sense of a recurring feature of events, a pattern of relationships among the facts presented to us in nature. The features which do not fall readily into such a pattern of purposiveness can not be ignored and suggest rather a doctrine of tychism or randomness in explanation. Cosmic purpose in a deterministic sense would indeed be fatal to human intention; but a teleological pattern is complementary and not contradictory to it. Teleology is external, relative to human beings. Even rela- tionships between two or more natural objects (not the self) are called "purposive" by analogies which project the inner inten-</page><page sequence="11">666 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tionality of men into external objects. We know nothing about "inner purposiveness" in nature, to use Kant's term; it is not as intention but as teleological adaptation that such is presented to us. Intention is immediate, teleology is intermediate; the one is intrinsic in its nature, the other is instrumental. The first we see from the inside, and the second from outside, which makes all the difference. We may hazard the guess (as does the panpsychist) that the character of the events which go on inside the natural object is of a piece with that of the events which go on inside us; that is not necessary, however, to establish purpose in either sense of this paper. We also make no attempt to define "purpose" in any sense in- clusive of both teleology and intention. Our aim has been to dis- tinguish, not to unify. This has, however, revealed the two to be complementary, indicating that ethics can not do without meta- physical inquiry, that any statements must be made from the anthropic perspective, and that analogy is unavoidable and sug- gestive in formulating our knowledge of the external world. F'inally, we have seen that teleology does not annul human inten- tion but makes its origin and completion in the natural order theoretically possible. Logically it is defensible and ethically it is humanly worthful. ROGER IHAZELTON. COLORADO COLLEGE.</page></plain_text>
