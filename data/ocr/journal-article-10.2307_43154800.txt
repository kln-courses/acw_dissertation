<plain_text><page sequence="1">Presidential Address: The Americanization of Panentheism ROBERT C. WHITTEMORE Tulane University Definitions of religion are legion, but very few of them are concerned to characterize with any accuracy the rather rarified religion encoun- tered in the systems of philosophers and philosophical theologians. That it must, in principle, exclude blind faith and serve no narrow sectarian interest is generally accepted, as is the stricture that it must be, if not entirely within the limits of reason alone, at least within the range of intellectual intuition. However, there are exceptions even to these criteria, and indeed, the only denominator common to all sys- tems is the assumption by each that religion presupposes that the sum and source of things is meaningful. In this assumption, then, we find our definition, at once applicable to all religions and every philosophi- cal theology: religion is assent to meaning. My universe and yours exhibits some significant degree of order, purpose, and value. This cannot be denied except by the consistent nihilist, and by him only at the cost of self-contradiction. But if we affirm it, as we must, then we are straightaway on the road to panen- theism, for that in some one or another of its variant forms, is what every religious philosophy comes to which attends consistently to the implications of this universal assent to meaning, and that because ac- ceptance of the Real as meaningful leads naturally and inevitably to the conception of the meaningful as a many unified as One or in One. It has ever been so in the systems of our European and Asian prede- cessors; it is so from the beginnings of American philosophical theology. Thus Samuel Willard, Teacher of the South Church in Boston from 1676 until his death in 1707, whose Compleat Body of Divinity stands as the first systematic theology produced by a native American, considers God as dipolar, as at once the Abstract Unity of the abstract reals, Goodness, Wisdom, Fullness, and Infinity, and as the principle of concretion originating and informing the activity of creation. Like his more famous fellow-divine, Jonathan Edwards, Willarďs concep- Reprinted by permission from The Southern Journal of Philosophy , Vol. 7, No. 1 (Spring, 1969). 2 37</page><page sequence="2">tion is essentially Platonic. For him it is the Abstract that is the Real; the Concrete is God as Being in a lesser mode. In the thought of Edwards, this notion of the divine abstract unities finds expression in the vision of space as God. That is to say, "that all the space there is, not proper to body, all the space there was before the creation, is God himself."1 It was and is a daring concept, and had Edwards followed his thinking through to its logical conclusion he would be, as Douglas Elwood2 argues that he is, the first American panentheist. But in truth he is not, and that for a variety of reasons as I have argued at length in a recent article on the theology of Edwards published in Volume XXXV of Church History . Who, then was the first American panentheist? There are scattered intimations of a new vision of God to be found in the writings of the ante-revolutionary protounitarians Charles Chauncy, Jonathan May- hew, and Ebenezer Gay, but these add up to nothing specific. The post-revolutionary deists, Ethan Allen, Elihu Palmer, and the iconoclast Tom Paine, did much to popularize the American drift away from the classical Calvinist conception of an ens perfectissimum , but no more than their universalist forebears and unitarian contemporaries do their views envisage an Encompassing. Nor is Job Durfee's somewhat Berke- leian conception of the universe as the imagery of the mind of God panentheism properly speaking, albeit there are in Durfee's magnum opus, the Panidea suggestions of panauxotheism, i.e., that variant form of panentheism found originally in the Hindu Veda, which conceives the universe as the apparent expansion of God. The same thought occurs to Laurens Hickok, but this younger contemporary of Durfee, more Calvinist than Coleridgean, invariably qualifies his most daring thoughts with the safe cliches of Christian orthodoxy. There is a famous passage in the first chapter of Emerson's Nature wherein the writer remarks the currents of Universal Being circulating through him and ecstatically proclaims himself "part or parcel of God." Then too, there is the Emersonian notion of the Oversoul. Did he intend to signify by this God in se, then he would indeed be, as some have said, a pantheist; however, it being more than likely that by Oversoul he means not God himself but only spirit incarnate, his position is more accurately and correctly called panentheism. Unfor- tunately, the idea of the Oversoul remains indeveloped, and nowhere 1 Jonathan Edwards, "Of Being," in The Philosophy of Jonathan Edwards From His Private Notebooks, ed. Harvey G.

And yet if Emerson is not the first American to take seriously Paul's proclamation that in God we live and move and have our being, his example, taken in conjunction with the panentheistic Hegelian ideal- ism espoused at midcentury by Walt Whitman and his spiritual bedfellows, William Torrey Harris and Elisha Mulford, and the proto- panentheistic religious liberalism preached in many a nineteenth cen- tury Eastern pulpit by George Angier Gordon, Minot Savage, Francis Howe Johnson, and Lyman Abbott, promoted the development of the intellectual climate that made possible the celebrated Concord Sum- mer School of Philosophy at which, in 1885, John Fiske made, in his lectures on The Idea of God as Effected by Modern Knowledge, the first public profession of panen theism. Fiske had not come lightly or early to the position he now main- tained. As a youth he had accepted as a matter of course that Calvinism in which he was bred up. From that he had been weaned while a student at Harvard by his reading of Herbert Spencer's First Principles . Of the truth of Spencer's principles respecting evolution, he was immediately and permanently convinced. What he could not accept was the Englishman's easy admission that Part One of his book, dedi- cated to the exposition of the Unknowable, was written simply and solely for the purpose of guarding himself against anticipated charges of atheism and materialism. The implicit cynicism of Spencer's can- dour he would overlook; its atheistic implication he must reject. The Spencerian doctrine of the Unknowable was, he believed, intrinsically theistic, and if the master did not choose to develop it as such, it was the duty of the disciple to do so. Consequently, in Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy (1874), deity was divested of all the anthropomorphic characteristics so objectionable to Spencer and his fellow scientists, God as an external cause acting on the universe from outside was re- nounced, and in His place appeared "a POWER, to which no limit in time or space is conceivable , of which all phenomena , as presented in consciousness , are manifestations , but which we can know only through these manifestations ."3 That this cosmic theism, as Fiske called it, left more questions than not unanswered did not at that time trouble Fiske. A decade later, however, he saw clearly what in the Outlines he had scarcely deigned to notice, namely, that acceptance of the doctrine of evolution pre-sup- posed a rejection of the Newtonian notion of the universe as a machine 3 John Fiske, Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy Based on the Doctrine of Evolution (2 vols.; Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1874), II, 514. Fiske's italics. 2 39</page><page sequence="4">operating in accordance with fixed laws decreed by the Cosmic Me- chanic. The universe, he now knows, is not a machine but an organism. It was not made, but it has grown. In every fibre this universe is, he tells his hearers, instinct with Life. Nowhere in nature is inertness or quiescence to be found. Reality is, in a word, panpsychic. Panpsychism becomes panentheism in the realization that this "Life" manifest in all Nature is "only a specialized form of the Universal Life," which is that "eternal God indwelling in the universe, in whom we live and move and have our being." For if, as noted earlier, God cannot be conceived as something outside the universe (as maintained in anthropomorphic theism), and if, as has been shown, we cannot identify Him or It with the universe phenomenally manifest (since this would be pantheism), then it must be that the one (theistic) alternative remaining is the truth: the universe is (as panen theism teaches) inside God! Fiske himself had said as much when he remarked at the conclusion of his exposition of the Cosmic Philosophy that, "from first to last it has been implied that, while the universe is the manifestation of Deity, yet is Deity something more than the universe"* Whether he was really aware of the significance of what he was saying is another question, and one that is not easily answered. In his last theological work, Through Nature to God (1899), Fiske allows that "the advance of modern science carries us irresistibly to what some German philosophers call monism, but that this same monism was simply a synonym for what one of these German philosophers, K. C. F. Krause, had called panentheism, he seems not to have realized. How- ever, as things turned out, it did not greatly matter. For even as Fiske was thinking these thoughts, his contemporary, the Harvard philos- opher Josiah Royce, was composing a far more comprehensive state- ment of a panentheistic conception of God. In that same year in which Fiske saw his last book through the press, Royce was in Scotland making the case for panentheistic idealism in his Gifford Lectures on The World and the Individual. Royce's commitment to panentheism dated back to late 1880's. At that time, in a series of lectures published in 1889 under the title The Spirit of Modern Philosophy , he had effected a transition in his thinking from the noetic monism earlier advocated in his doctoral dissertation and in his first book, The Religious Aspect of Philosophy , to an incipiently panentheistic monism. Where previously he had thought it sufficient to identify the Absolute as Infinite Thought, now he would have his reader realize that the Absolute is that One who, as Royce puts it, "includes us, who has the world present to himself 4 Ibid., II, 414. My italics. 240</page><page sequence="5">in unity, before whom all past and future truth, all distant and dark truth is clear in one eternal moment, to whom far and forgot is near, who thinks of the whole of nature, and in whom are all things, the Logos, the world-possessor."5 As error implies its encompassing truth, so too, he argues, does that World of Description which is the realm of public fact retailed by science imply that World of Appreciation which is the Absolute as Infinite Being sensitive to the values in the facts. What men call true, the world of nature and the unending universe of stars in empty space, is simply "show," the appearance of a reality indescribable by any scientific means. In his subsequent "Address to the Philosophical Union of the University of California," Royce names this reality Absolute Experience, and thinks it to be an unitary organ- ism, endless in its variegated complexity and related to our individual experience as an organic whole to its own fragments. The notion is further elaborated and defended in detail against the objections of Professors Mezes, Howison, and LeConte in a Supplementary Essay, afterwards published together with the Address and the remarks of these critics under the title, The Conception of God . Theologically speaking, it is the most significant of Royce's many works. True, the argument as formulated five years later in The World and the Individual is more elaborately worked out, but for all of that it is neither as precise nor as directly to the point as that of the Essay and the Address, and this for the simple reason that in these writings Royce is not primarily concerned with general problems raised and resolved by himself, but with specific issues and objections posed by others. His answers to them are presupposed throughout his subsequent writings. On their philosophical validity his case depends and rests. The Absolute exists. This, Royce's first critic, Professor Sidney Mezes, is not disposed to deny. But is the Absolute - God? That he doubts. For consider what it is that Royce has proved. He has shown, Mezes believes, that the contents of the Absolute consist "of the outer world of science, of your present feelings, thoughts, puzzles, and aspirations, and, in addition, of the answers to your present puzzles and the satis- faction of your present aspirations." What he has not shown is that the Ultimate Being which encompasses all these is a spiritual being, i.e., a being of that worth and dignity commonly ascribed to God. He has argued that the Absolute is eternally complete, and has claimed that as such it is moral, since in it all error and immorality are overcome by truth and goodness. But are completeness and goodness compatible? Mezes does not think so. Goodness implies progress and the chance 5 Josiah Royce, The Spirit of Modern Philosophy (New York: George Braziller, *955)&gt; P- 374- 241</page><page sequence="6">to grow in worth. "The very life of morality is toil, struggle, achieve- ment; we must overcome difficulties; the stream of morality must rise higher than its source. Take progress away, and you destroy morality."6 No goal, no God; that, if Mezes is right, is the sum and substance of the matter. Granted that the Absolute exists, it does not follow that It is that He whom men call God, for God is Good, and Goodness is quite destitute of consistency with Completeness. That Royce has failed to establish the Absolute as God, Professor George Holmes Howison agrees. But neither, he thinks, has Mezes, for both are guilty of the same mistake; both fail to take account of the difference in kind between Creator and creature. It makes no difference whether or not the Absolute is conceived as growing in goodness through time. Whether growing or complete, the Absolute is Reality. Neither conception provides adequately for a public of thinkers, a manifold of selves. "If the Infinite Self includes us all, and all our expe- riences,- sensations and sins, as well as the rest,- in the unity of one life, and includes us and them directly ; if there is but one and the same final Self for each and all, then, with the literalness indeed appalling, "He is we, and we are He; nay, He is I, and I am He And how can there be talk of a Moral Order, since there is but a single mind in the case?- we cannot legitimately call that mind a person"1 Whatever logic may say, our moral sense, says Howison, must rebel against an Idealism which reduces the finite individual to naught. Instinct, not to mention common sense, simply will not allow that all we are is what the Absolute is. "... the religious reason firmly avers that there must be some flaw in such philosophising, and in the name of all reason, protests against the claim that this conception of God is the inevitable outcome of a reflective philosophy." Royce saw no flaw, perhaps because there was none. Nonetheless, he was disturbed by Howison's implication that his conception of the Absolute was like that night in which all cows are black. There was, he thought, room enough in his conception for ethical individuality. The problem was- to prove it. A year later, opportunity knocked in the form of an invitation from the Philosophical Union to put on record his replies to critics, and he responded with a supplementary essay on The Absolute and the Individual. It begins, as ought every inquiry into the problem of the Many and the One, with the most fundamental of all philosophical questions: What is Real? Common sense tells us that it is the world outside our 6 The Conception of God (New York: Macmillan, 1898), p. 63. Mezes' italics. 7 Ibid., pp. 98-99. Howison's italics. 242</page><page sequence="7">eyes, the world we cannot wish or think away. Something there is that is independent of each and all of us. To this conviction our conscious- ness bears witness; on it Realism is founded. Is Realism true? Common sense does not doubt it, and neither, when all is said and done, do most philosophers, including, Royce believes, Professor Howison. Idealism, of course, must and does deny that anything is independent of that Absolute which is for it the Real. To some extent, therefore, it must and does contradict the common sense of consciousness. Obviously, then, if Realism is true, Idealism must be false; since it is not, Realism must be, as Royce thinks it is, refutable. Into the details of this refutation, the limitations of your time and the range of my subject forbid that I should enter. Those interested will find the whole of the argument rehearsed in my Makers of the American Mindy (pp. 389-94). Suffice it to note here the Roycean conclusion, which is that Realism errs in its assumption that real things are independently existing things. For this independence, so far from being known, turns out upon analysis to be, in principle and in fact, unknowable. Nor does it avail the Realist to say that the inde- pendent is the unknown, since the unknown, known as such, is not, in truth, unknown. Everything knowable, therefore, being such only in virtue of being in relation to some knower, to be real is to be related, and that to somebody, and that somebody in the last analysis- God. In his article on Immortality, written towards the close of his life, Royce sums up the whole conception thus: I mean by the term "God" the totality of the expressions and life of the world-will, when considered in its conscious unity. God is a consciousness which knows and which intends the entire life of the world, a consciousness which views this life at one glance, as its own life and self, and which therefore not only wills but obtains, not only seeks but possesses, not only passes from expression to expression, but eternally is the entire temporal sequence of its own expressions. God has and is a will, and this will, if viewed as a tem- poral sequence of activities, is identical with what I have called the world-will. Only, when viewed as the divine will, this world-will is taken not merely as an infinite sequence of will-activities, but in its eternal unity as one whole of life. God is omniscient, because his insight comprehends and finds unified, in one eternal instant, the totality of the temporal process, with all its contents and meanings. He is omnipotent, because all that is done is, when viewed in its unity, his deed, and that despite the endless varieties and strifes which freedom and which the variety of individual finite expressions involve. God is immanent in the finite, because nothing is which is 243</page><page sequence="8">not a part of his total self-expression. He is transcendent of all finitude, because the totality of finite processes is before him at once, while nothing finite possess true totality.8 Is this to say, as Howison has contended, that in the end the finite individual is swallowed up in God? Royce will not concede it. We are, he admits, what God is; still, were we not ourselves, God would be less than He is. Indubitably so. But there are questions left to answer, and no answers other than those already offered are forth- coming. II Josiah Royce died in 1916, and with his passing Idealism ceased to command the American mind. The times had changed. To the genera- tion caught up in the tragedy of world war, the very thought of life literally in God suggested a cancerous deity. Postwar, a new world-view was in the making. The new absolute was Einstein's Unified Field; the new word in cosmology was "process." Realism, reduced to animal faith by Santayana, shortly joined Idealism in limbo. In European phi- losophy, positivism and existentialism were the rising fashion, and Americans, ever imitative, began to echo the latest continental catch- words. In England a distinguished mathematician retired and decided to spend his sunset years at Harvard. From the standpoint of American panentheism it was a most fortunate choice, and its consequences are still unfolding. So pervasive has been the influence of Alfred North Whitehead in the shaping of contemporary American panentheism that it is difficult to imagine what the philosophical situation would be today had he not assayed that system of cosmo-theology published under the title Process and Reality . Certainly the cosmological scope, not to mention the theological sophistication, of current panentheistic thoery would be much the less. The rudimentary statements of panentheism found in the works of Montague, Boodin, Wieman, Pratt, and Brightman would most probably still be the order of the day, and it is quite unlikely that Hartshorne, Weiss, and Pittenger would have been moved to produce their improvements had not Whitehead's system been avail- able to improve upon. But is that system a panentheism? The term itself does not appear anywhere in Whitehead's writings; and there are scholars who, by reason of their commitment to gods more conventional or to no God at all, believe that it is possible to make sense of Process and Reality without having recourse to its doctrine of God. Still others would 8 Josiah Royce, "Immortality," The Hibbert Journal , 5 (1907), 738-39. 244</page><page sequence="9">have it that this doctrine of God, for all that it is integral to the system, is essentially the God of that Church of England which Whitehead's father and grandfather served and which he, so far as is known, never specifically disavowed. William Christian, whose book, An Interpreta- tion of Whitehead's Metaphysics , is, in the present lecturer's opinion, the most thorough and informed study of the subject yet produced, seems to incline to this view when he remarks that "the outcome of his (Whitehead's) theory may be closer to traditional theology than some interpreters (he is thinking of Hartshorne) have taken it to be."9 Just how much closer Christian does not specify, but close enough, he thinks, to justify characterizing Whitehead as a theist (in the tradi- tional sense) rather than as a panentheist. For, he argues, if panen- theism is, as Hartshorne says, that view of God which makes him to be both the sum or system of dependent thinking and something independent of that system, then Whitehead is not a panentheist, "since his theory of God and the world differs in essential respects from the view Hartshorne proposes. God does not literally include or contain the world; and he transcends the world, not merely in his 'essence' but in his concrete actuality."10 "Thus," he concludes, "the relation between God and the world is not the relation between a whole and a part. It is a relation between (a) an actual entity in unison with every becoming with a continuous though changing satisfaction, and (b) actual entities which become and perish at particular where- whens in the course of nature."11 In other words, it is as the orthodox have always said: God as an actual entity is literally something other than the actual entities he experiences, and this experience is best understood in traditional Christian terms! As those of you who are students of Whitehead will have noted, much, if not all, of Christian's case hinges upon the correctness of the foregoing characterization of God as an actual entity. True, Whitehead does call God an actual entity.12 He does say that "the description of the generic character of an actual entity should include God as well as the lowliest actual occasion,"13 but he immediately qualifies this statement by adding, "though there is a specifìc difference between the nature of God and that of any occasion,"14 and in other passages we 9 William A. Christian. An Interpretation of Whitehead's Metaphysics (New Haven: Yale University Press, ickq), p. 412. 10 Ibid., P. 405. 11 Ibid., p. 409. 12 Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York: Social Science Bookstore, 1Q41), p. 28. is Ibid., p. 168. 14 Ibid., my italics. 245</page><page sequence="10">are told that "the term 'actual occasion' will always exclude God from its scope,"15 and apprised of the difference between God and all other actual entities arising from the fact of his being "primordial" in a sense that they are not.16 To Hartshorne, as indeed to most post- Whiteheadians- including the present speaker, these qualifications of the original statement suffice to justify calling in question the accuracy and adequacy of Whitehead's characterization of God as an actual entity. Christian, who of course is quite familiar with these qualifying passages, sees in them nothing to warrant a retreat from his denial that Whitehead is a panentheist. He may be right, although I do not think so, and in any case the issue is to be settled only by a careful comparative analysis of the relevant texts, and that is here out of the question. One point, however, does require remarking, and that has to do with Christian's contention that "since God is an actual entity, he is not a nexus and hence not (as Hartshorne and others have said) a society of any kind."17 Here, as before, the assumption is that God is literally and solely actual entity, and that his being such excludes his being any- thing more or other than an actual entity. But again there are White- head's own qualifying clauses to be considered, and again the sense of the whole to be taken into account, and again the assertion that when this is done the result is to deny the denial that Whitehead is a panentheist. Even so, did the case against Christian's interpretation of White- head's conception of God rest on no more than the above, the end result would be at best a Scotch verdict-case not proven. In fact, it rests on rather more than this, for Christian's position presupposes not only that God is simply an actual entity (ignoring the Whiteheadian qualifiers) but also an understanding of "transcendence" and of "in- dependence," which, in light of the whole of Whitehead's cosmological scheme, seems no more justified than his assumptions respecting "actual entity." Since Christian does not distinguish the various senses of "transcendence" it is difficult to pinpoint precisely his understanding of the term; but his usage conveys the impression that he thinks of it as the orthodox do, that is, as something other than, and separated from, that which is transcended. And similarly as regards his usage of "independence," this again is such as any scholastic theologian would find comfortingly familiar. But "independence" is not a word that Whitehead employs, and "transcendence" is, as Hartshorne has shown, a term of divers meanings! 15 Ibid. y p. 135. 16 lbid.y p. 116. 17 Op. cit., p. 408. 246</page><page sequence="11">Is Whitehead a panentheist? Christian says no, and the thoroughness and quality of his scholarship forbid that we should take his answer lightly. But what does Whitehead say? The relevant passages from Process and Reality are, for the most part, those having to do with the consequent nature of God. As Whitehead defines it, "the consequent nature of God is the Physical prehension by God of the actualities of the evolving universe/'18 It "is the fulfillment of his experience by his reception of the multiple freedom of actuality into the harmony of his own actualization. It is God as really actual, completing the de- ficiency of his mere conceptual actuality."19 "It is Goďs conceptual realization performing an efficacious role in multple unifications of the universe .... "20 "It is just as much one immediate fact as it is an unresting advance beyond itself."21 In other words: It is as true to say that the World is immanent in God, as that God is immanent in the World. It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God. It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God.22 I would not be so bold as to contend that the purport of these some- what sybilline sentences is plain to see, but I do suggest that their meaning is sufficiently unambiguous to allow the conclusion that we do not have here to do with the idea of God as a something distinct and separate from the world. Conversely, these sentences do not, I concede, necessarily suggest a panentheistic conception of the God- World relationship, although I should add that they seem to me more properly descriptive of it than of the alternative espoused by Christian orthodoxy, and I further suggest that this conclusion finds reinforce- ment in the application of these same sentences to the classification schémas of Hartshorne. Yet beyond the question of meaning there lies, as Christian has noted, the question of truth. He sidesteps it with a bow to the bias of logical empiricism. But truth will out; and the truth is, I submit, that Whitehead's philosophy, call it panentheism or what you will, implies four paradoxes, any one of which suffices to convict the system of that incoherence which it is one basic aim of Whitehead to avoid. The four paradoxes, elaborated and documented in the Whitehead 18 Process and Reality, p. 1 34. My italics. 19 Ibid., p. 530. 20 Ibid. 21 Ibid., p. 531. 22 Ibid., p. 528. 247</page><page sequence="12">chapter of my forthcoming book, The Foundations of Panentheismf are: (1) that God is, yet is not, an actual entity; (2) that Creativity is and is not temporal; (3) that God is and is not in time; (4) that there is, yet there cannot be, a time-lag between the primordial and the consequent natures of God. It should be noted that these paradoxes are one and all avoidable, but only at the cost of enunciating one still more potent paradox, and that arising from analysis of Whitehead's dictum- that extensiveness becomes, but that Becoming is not itself extensive, the paradox, that is, of holding God to be at once non- temporal and immanent in the world. Faced with such a formidable set of barriers to understanding it is not surprising to find the post-Whiteheadians seeking ways to improve the master's conception of God rather than, as good disciples should, ways of explanation of that provided. Thus Paul Weiss elects to develop his own categoreal scheme of the modes of being God, while Norman Pittenger and Lionel Thornton think to find in process theology a contemporary version of the teaching of the Church of England. Of those allowing that their theological inspirations have their source in the system displayed in Process and Reality , Charles Hartshorne is perhaps the most faithful to the spirit of the original; but even he prefers a new terminology and a change of emphasis. Whitehead says plainly that God is dipolar,23 and dipolarity is, for Hartshorne, the sine qua non of panentheism. Because Spinoza will not have it that God is thus both necessary and contingent, he is dis- missed as being "merely a half-hearted panentheist,"24 and this despite the fact that his divine Substance is clearly an Encompassing. White- head, on the other hand, is hailed as "the outstanding surrelativist or panentheist,"25 and that presumably because of his profession of polar contrasts in deity. All in all, it hardly seems fair, but on the question of contingency in God, Hartshorne is adamant. "The essential point for me is," he writes in a letter to the lecturer,26 "unequivocal recognition of contingent states of deity." And his many books and articles confirm that it is so. That Hartshorne's philosophical theology is not only a panentheism but the latest and most logical form of panentheism has not been questioned heretofore. Such critical attention as he has received,27 has 23 Ibid., p. 524. 24 Charles Hartshorne and William L. Reese, Philosophers Speak of God (Chica- go: University of Chicago Press, 1953), p. 197. 25 Ibid., p. 273. 26 Hartshorne to Whittemore, Aug. 30, 1963. 27 It has been less than the importance of his position merits. To the best of my knowledge, what follows is all. See Jacob Taubes, "Philosophers Speak of God," The Journal of Religion, XXXIV ( 1954) , 120-26; Francis H. Parker, "Head, Heart, 248</page><page sequence="13">been directed, in the main, against the theoretical adequacy of his position rather than against the correctness of the classification of that position as panentheism. And yet if dipolarity is the criterion, the ob- jection raised by Christian to the characterization of Whitehead's conception of God as panentheism reappears in full force. For dipolarity signifies nothing more than that God is in some sense at once tran- scendent and immanent; and that, as has been argued, is not the same as saying that God is an Encompassing. Hartshorne himself seems to concede as much when, in the aforementioned letter to this lecturer, he writes, "I make more use now of 'neoclassical theism' than of panen- theism, partly because the historical meaning of the latter term has only a loose connection with what I mean." Is this to say, as perhaps Christian would, that Hartshorne's view is no more panentheism? No, for Hartshorne is careful to point out28 that as far as religious meaning is concerned, the term "neoclassical theism" is interchange- able with the term "panentheism," for both terms, to his way of thinking, define "an eternal abstract essence in a God who, in his full concrete actuality or process of experience, includes all contingent things, as unessential but not, for all that, unreal properties- in other words, accidents."29 That panentheism thus defined should be free from difficulties both inherent and imagined is, of course, not to be expected. No more than the "historical" expressions is this one to be thought of as an universal philosophical or theological panacea. But by the same token, no ex- pression, this one included, is to be taken as adequate which does not face up candidly to the objections brought against it. The objections brought against Hartshorne's position divide roughly into three types: (1) those resulting either from ambiguities in the meanings of his terms or from a failure to grasp the significance these terms seek to express; (2) those having their roots in differences of metaphysical principle or cosmological outlook; and (3) those arising from the conviction that the vision of God herein presented is not such as can at all satisfy either the requirements of Christian doctrine or the religious consciousness as such. For a complete treatment I must beg leave to refer you to the chapter on Hartshorne in the above and God/' The Review of Metaphysics, XIV (i960), 328-52; Andrew J. Reck, "The Philosophy of Charles Hartshorne," Tulane Studies in Philosophy , X ( 1961 ) , 89-108; John Wild, "The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne," The Review of Metaphysics , 4 (1950), 61-84; and Edward Farley, The Tran- scendence of God (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1958), Chap. V. 28 See The Logic of Perfection and Other Essays in Neoclassical Metaphysics (LaSalle, Illinois: Open Court, 1962), 42i. 29 Charles Hartshorne, "Whitehead and Berdyaev: Ts there Tragedy in God/ " The Journal of Religion , 37 (1957), 76. 249</page><page sequence="14">mentioned Foundations of Panentheism. Here I will take note of but one objection, and that perhaps the most important since it stems from the simple failure to understand what Hartshorne is trying to convey. The objection in question is to Hartshorne's definition of the Ab- solute as God in his abstract aspect conceived as contained within that super-relative which is God qua concrete. This, it is contended, is not only misleading but contradictory. For if "relative" inevitably implies contingency, then "superrelative" must imply contingency to the n'th degree. Moreover, insofar as "relative" entails the notion of deficiency, so does it seem that "super-relative" entails deficiency infinitized. It appears to follow that God in his totality as concrete and super-relative must be of all entities the most contingent and deficient. What Hartshorne wants to say, but what his terminology mitigates against his saying, is not that God is contingent, but that God as super- relative exhibits the realm of relations in its most inclusive aspect. He does not mean to suggest that God is deficient, but rather that he is incomplete, growing, perfect at any present instant but perfectible at that succeeding instant in which God surpasses himself. By "relative" Hartshorne means not "contingent" but "related-to." His choice of such terms is governed by an awareness that to define "Absolute," as did Fechner, Lotze, Paulsen, and Ward, as "God-and-the-world," or as "God-with-the-world," is to imply (unintentionally) an entitative distinction between God and the world, and such entitative distinction Hartshorne is, of course, at some pains to deny. More than this, he would contend that his choice of terms is the only clear and unambiguous way to point out the scholastic fallacy of taking "God" to be synonymous with "Absolute"-- for if the two are not synonymous (and most panpsychists, Hartshorne among them, are agreed that they are not), then all the arguments, proofs, and attri- butions directed towards the vindication of a God so identified (i.e., as synonymous with "Absolute") which have encountered such wide- spread contemporary rejection, may be valid (as directed to supporting belief in the existence of God as AR) after all. These reasons notwithstanding, however, the objection might be pressed that the misconceptions arising from the use of "super-relative" to signify the "Absolute" are such as to outweigh any advantages which might accrue from its adoption. For "Absolute," whatever else it has signified, has throughout the history of philosophy signified that which is concrete as well as abstract. Fechner, Paulsen, and Royce, to name but three within Hartshorne's own tradition, have recognized this in their choosing to call "Absolute" that unity which is God as with the world, rather than adopting Hartshorne's alternative and identifying 250</page><page sequence="15">the Absolute with the abstract. In short, these men would have said that no en tita tive distinction (as between God and the world) is in- volved in so defining the Absolute. What is involved is that God is inclusive of the world, is one with it, and yet is more than it. Such a view, they might argue, satisfies the requirements of panentheism equally as well as Hartshorne's, and despite the defect previously noted, does so without generating any of the confusion the use of such terms as "super-relative" seems to entail. It will be said by positivists that what is here at issue is, after all, merely a question of preferring one linguistic proposal to another, and in a way they are right. But linguistic proposals have a way, unfor- tunately, of growing up to be philosophical bugbears, and in any case the choice of that terminology which will best clarify a funda- mental cosmological idea is by no means trivial. And if we must choose, I would suggest that a reversion to that mode of expression peculiar to Hartshorne's "historical" predecessors might better serve to clarify an idea common to all the philosophers con- cerned. For to retain Hartshorne's usage would, it seems to me, be to fail to do justice to God considered in his Whole (as distinguished from the parts) aspect. Hartshorne's view may not mean that "God" in "God-and-the-world" is abstract (most certainly it does mean that aspect of God which is mind, as contrasted with the world which is - literally- his body), but his terminology does tend to support such an inference. Had I the time and you the patience, we might pursue the subject of Hartshorne's panentheism through several more pages of argument. To what end? Certainly to none other than that already attained. And, in any case, when all is said, what matters most is your recognition of the historical and contemporary vitality of the American panentheistic tra- dition. For the evolution of that tradition is as yet incomplete and the passage continues. 251</page></plain_text>
