<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews spective, which emphasize the person, the subject, and character. Throughout the book the author uses cases and illustrations to show how a fitting pastoral counselling follows from such an ethical theory. The illustrations also point out how some contemporary pastoral counselors have in practice accepted other ethical approaches. In a true sense this book is a bridge between two related disciplines, but it is more than just a bridge. Browning makes significant contributions to both Christian ethics and pastoral care. From the perspective of Christian ethics, there are some questions that arise. What about conflicts that can arise on each ethical level (e.g., between God as creator, governor, and redeemer) and among the various levels? Is Browning too negative on a proper love of self? How would spiritual direction fit into the schema? Would it help to recognize an ethical distinction between justifying causes and excusing causes as the basis for a distinction between the level of ethics and the level of pastoral counseling? In summary, this significant book is important not only for pastoral care but for Christian ethics as well. CHARLES E. CURRAN, Catholic University of America. MCDARGH, JOHN. Psychoanalytic Object Relations Theory and the Study of Religion. On Faith and the Imaging of God. New York: University Press of America, 1983. An important and valuable contribution to the psychological study of religion, this book represents the first major exploration of object relations theory as a paradigm for understanding human religiosity. Such pioneers in psycho- analytic object relations theory as H. Guntrip and D. W. Winnicott have attempted in preliminary and suggestive ways to link their ideas about psycho- logical development with religious experiences and beliefs. Scholars of religion as well, including P. Homans and P. Pruyser, have suggested such a marriage of ideas. However, a systematic and comprehensive application of this rela- tively new development of psychoanalytic theory to the study of religion has been, until now, lacking. McDargh's integration of "a higher reading of Freud" with a "higher reading of religion" (as faith) thus fills a major lacuna in the literature. His search for the source of the experience of faith and the "imaging of God" in the pre-oedipal period of early object relations is timely, sensitive, and (for the most part) nonreductionistic. The strengths of the book are many. It offers a creative and ecumenical understanding of faith (drawing upon H. Richard Niebuhr and Karl Rahner) from the genesis of faith in the fragmented self to its telos in the capacity to tolerate ambivalence and the availability for loving self-donation. For the uninitiated, it provides a clear introduction to the principle tenets of object relations theory. Expanding upon the insights of J. W. Fowler and W. W. Meissner, S.J., it makes a significant contribution to faith develop- ment theory. It also accomplishes that rare feat of uniting theory with life: the two extensive case studies which conclude the book provide a solid foundation in the realm of lived experience for the theoretical trajectory. In addition, it manages successfully to avoid sexist language and stereo- types. McDargh's occasional use of the female pronoun as generic; his 225</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion exploration of the rich inner lives of two female subjects; and his brief discus- sions of the potential contributions of maternal imagery to the idea of God demonstrate a sensitivity to these concerns. There are, however, limitations to the analysis. McDargh purports to offer a paradigm relevant to all religions: he sees faith as a "universal human dynamic that cuts across lines of belief and barriers of culture" (p. 5). But the argument falls far short of the universality toward which it aims: the substan- tive understanding of religion offered by McDargh necessitates a personal, theistic deity. As he says, "human religiousness . .in order to be genuinely religious, must somehow be configured as personal" (p. 10; see also p. 105). Are the only true faiths, then, theistic? Must God be imaged as personal, anthropomorphic, transcendent, and other than self, for a religion to qualify as genuine? What of monistic Hinduism, in which Brahman, the divine, is neither personal nor other than self? What of Theravada Buddhism, which postulates no divinity and no self? This study falls prey to a danger common to many psychological studies of religion, not the least of which is Freud's: Western monotheism provides the definition and the norm; all else falls out- side of the category and is either ignored or relegated to a lower position in the developmental hierarchy. One can find no quarrel with McDargh's contention that object relations theory is a powerful model for understanding the origins of human religiosity. However, his neglect of certain essential elements of human faith is trouble- some. There are, in fact, resources in object relations theory for a more uni- versal and less ethnocentric vision of human religiosity. The potential of object relations theory as a paradigm for understanding religion remains, in this book, incompletely tapped. There are other minor limitations, including the lack of an index, and the very transparent origin of the book as a doctoral dissertation (Harvard Uni- versity, 1981). Nevertheless, these flaws do not obscure the value and signifi- cance of the ideas. McDargh has created a richly interwoven tapestry, of interest to both the generalist and the specialist. He lucidly demonstrates the great value of psychoanalytic object relations theory as a resource for address- ing a central problem in the psychology of faith development: the role of the representation of God in the life of faith.

This volume includes papers of the second conference on the history of reli- gions held at the University of Chicago in 1983 by Ugo Bianchi, Mircea Eliade, Joseph Kitagawa, Charles Long, Michel Meslin, Paul Ricoeur, Kurt Rudolph, and Ninian Smart, an introduction and an afterword. With the exceptions of Eliade and Ricoeur, the papers and the discussion summarized in the afterword reflect upon the history and future of the history and phe- nomenology of religion. This volume should be a valuable document for those unfamiliar with this field of study and Chicago's contribution to its develop- ment.
