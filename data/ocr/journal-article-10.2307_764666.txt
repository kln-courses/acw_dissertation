<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Trident Case and the Evolutionary Theory of F. A. Hayek SURI RATNAPALA* Introduction The processes of reasoning which common law judges employ in rationalizing departures from established principles of law, came into sharp focus in the case of Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v McNiece Bros Pty Ltd.' In that case, the High Court of Australia decided, by a majority, that a person who was not a party to an insurance policy had the right to be indemnified by the insurer under that policy. More importantly, three of the seven judges held that the long established doctrines of privity and consideration should not be applied to the third party claim, thereby recognizing exceptions to the two rules. Decisions which seek to change established law always raise the question of the legitimacy of judicial 'lawmaking'. The positivist response generally takes the form of the assertion that judges have delegated legislative power. In Austinian theory, their decisions are tacitly ratified by legislative inaction and/or by the enforcement of judgments by the coercive power of the sovereign. According to Kelsen, judicial laws are validated by norms authorizing their creation. Accord- ing to Hart, judges are authorized to make law by the rules of recognition. In each case, the judge's legislative power appears to be restrained only by the terms of the delegation. No doubt, these terms impose severe limitations on the legislative discretion of judges. Thus, a judge has no general legislative power but may make law only in relation to the point at issue before him. A judge also must not decide against the legislative will. A law made by a judge is always subject to vitiation by the political legislature. However, besides these con- straints, positivist theory places no limit on the legislative discretion of judges.

Raz typically asserts that 'when deciding whether and how to change the law, [the House of Lords] acts predominantly on non-legal reasons, ie it exercises discretion'.4 There are other jurisprudential theories which explain the judicial role differently. Of these, the best known in the English speaking world is that of Dworkin himself. Dworkin argues that judges are politically responsible. Since they are not elected, but are yet politically responsible, they must never legislate. When rules run out they should not decide in an 'intuitionistic' manner. Political responsibility requires them to make only such 'decisions as they can justify within a political theory that also justifies the other decisions they propose to make'.' Dworkin's theory is essentially declaratory. In every case, there is a right decision. It may be very hard to find because there are competing principles, both of substantive and precedential nature. Judges may get it wrong. But these difficulties do not warrant the conclusion that judges are making law or that they should make law.6 The focus of this essay is not Dworkin's theory but a less known theory of common law adjudication. It belongs in the jurisprudential tradition which embraces the romantic, the historical and the anthropological schools. Its author is the Nobel laureate economist and jurist F. A. Hayek. How do common law judges, perceive their own role? In recent times there has been a spate of essays written by judges on the subject of judicial 'lawmaking' in England and in Australia.7 Almost invariably they have concluded that judges make 'law'. Nevertheless, they also insist in one form or another that their lawmaking activity is not capricious but is 'principled'. They see no contradic- tion between these two positions and see no need to reconcile them. The reason is that they proceed, perhaps unconsciously, on the basis of the positivist notion of law. The principles which constrain them in the formulation of legal rules are not, themselves, law because they have not been formally enacted by judge or parliament. They are not binding because a judge may act contrary to them and still create law. In Austinian terms, these principles would be no more than principles of 'positive morality' by which judges are guided. 2 Justice Michael McHugh of the Australian High Court states that a judge cannot make a law which will not fit the general body of established law. He does not clarify whether this limitation is derived from legal principle, is an intrinsic feature of the judicial method or is dictated by the practical necessity to keep the body of law in harmony.

Yet, beyond this point, there is much disagreement concerning the nature of the principles which guide judicial lawmaking, their obligatoriness, and indeed, their content.8 Judges and theorists express these principles in a variety of ways. Most formulations are cast very broadly. MacCormick, for example, states that judges are guided by their conceptions of 'justice, public policy and common sense'.9 McHugh J asserts that judges may, within the area of their discretion legislate according to the 'public interest having regard to ... the whole range of social, economic and industrial interests'.'0 Brennan J states that 'radical changes must be mandated by substantial nonephemeral shifts in community values or by palpable defects in existing legal doctrine'." To some extent these formulations reflect ideological pre-dispositions. Thus, McHugh J's criterion appears to represent an interven- tionist approach, whereas Brennan J's criterion reflects a more classically liberal approach. Despite the recent proliferation of writings on this topic, the nature and content of the principles which guide judicial 'lawmaking' remain unsettled. In his book Law Legislation and Liberty, Hayek sets out an explicit thesis concerning the role of the judge in the process by which the common law develops. The aim of this essay is to introduce Hayek's thesis with a view to invigorating the debate concerning the judicial method. I propose to explain the Hayekean theory and to illustrate its viability through an analysis of the judgments in the Trident Case. In the first part of this essay, I will set out the legal issues, the basic facts and the conclusions of the judges in the Trident Case. In the second part, I will outline the evolutionary theory of law as expounded by Hayek, with particular attention to his view of the role of the common law judge. In the third part, I will return to the Trident Case to consider the several judgments therein in the light of the evolutionary theory. I The Trident Case The Problem A enters into a contract with B under which A agrees to confer a benefit on C who is not a party to the contract. B does not act as C's agent. If A fails to confer the benefit, C cannot sue A in contract since: (1) C is not a party to the contract (doctrine of privity) and (2) C has not provided consideration (doctrine of consideration). " For an excellent survey and discussion of the Australian judicial positions on these issues, see B.

(4) The contract and/or other actions of A and B may evidence an intention to create a trust, whereby B holds the benefit in trust for C. B may then sue A on behalf of C and if he does not, C may sue A directly, making B also a defendant.'5 (But no such intent may be manifest). (5) C may have a statutory right to sue conferred by enactments such as the Property Law Act, 1974 (Qld). Under section 55 of this Act, C could sue A if C has assented to the terms by words or conduct."'6 However, C will not have the right to sue unless A and B have agreed that not only should he have a benefit, but should also have the right to sue for the benefit. Trident Trident Insurance entered into a contract with Blue Circle Cement whereby Trident agreed to indemnify Blue Circle and its contractors, sub-contractors and suppliers against personal injury liability incurred at Blue Circle's building sites. McNiece Bros, a contractor, had to pay over half a million dollars to a worker injured at a Blue Circle work site. McNiece claimed indemnity from Trident, who refused to pay. McNiece was not a contractor at the time the contract was made. Yeldham J, in the NSW Supreme Court, held that McNiece had ratified the contract, and hence was entitled to recover under the contract. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that McNiece was not a party to the contract by ratification, but held that it could sue under the policy of insurance, even though it was not a party to the contract and had provided no consideration..' In the High Court, five out of seven judges decided that McNiece was entitled to be indemnified by Trident. Mason CJ and Wilson J held that the principled development of the law required the recognition that the old requirements of privity and consideration should not apply to insurance policies.'8 Toohey J held 2 Coulls v Bagot's Executor (1967) 119 CLR 460 at 501, 502. 13 Coulls v Bagot's Executor (1967) 119 CLR 490 at 478, 503.

Only three of the seven judges recognized the inapplicability of the two requirements to insurance policies. Yet the reasoning of all the judges, in reaching their respective positions, is highly instructive in evaluating the present day relevance of the evolutionary theory of law. II The Evolutionary Theory of Law The evolutionary theory of law, which I propose to discuss in this paper, belongs in the intellectual tradition which embraces both the historical school of jurisprudence associated with the Romantic Movement and the modem anthro- pological work concerning law in tribal societies. It is impossible, within the scope of this essay, to traverse or even to summarize usefully, the major contributions to this tradition. They include the romantic work of F. C. Von Savigny and Sir Henry Maine and the empirical work of Hoebel, Gluckman, Leach, Malinowski and others. These writers have produced a range of differing theories explaining the phenomenon of law. However, there is an important common denominator in the work of all of them. Without exception, they seek to demonstrate, contrary to positivist theory, that there exists a type of law which is not deliberately made. They also differ from natural law theorists in not seeking the source of this law in a superhuman entity or design. They endeavour to explain this type of law as a phenomenon which occurs as a result of the social dynamics of the group. Two Anthropological Facts In this paper, I wish to concentrate on the most sophisticated theory to emerge from this tradition, that of F. A. Hayek. Before I do so, it is helpful to note two basic anthropological facts. The first is that there was always law. The second is that, until recently, deliberate law-making was not commonplace. Ethnocentric legal positivism denies the name 'law' to the rules of ancient societies. But, when we look at any point in time in the history of human societies, we see, according to anthropological evidence, that 'law' in some sense 19 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 172. 20 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 153-154.

As Malinowski demonstrated in his study of the Trobrianders, it is a mistake to regard primitive societies as lacking in law because they lack central authority, codes, courts and constables. Trobrianders are an orderly society without any of them.22 Hayek reminds us that humans lived for something like a million years in groups held together by common rules of conduct while they developed reason and language needed to articulate those rules.23 For the ancients, law existed from immemorial antiquity. Deliberate law making is a relatively recent human activity. Leach points out, in the context of human history as a whole, lawmaking is unusual.24 Modem advances in anthropology and ethnology have provided us with valuable insights into the manner in which traditions are formed and hardened into rules of enforceable law. Ancient and medieval thinking, however, was not so well informed. In the absence of an empirical explanation, these things were attributed to mythical law-givers, who were the legendary kings, heroes and prophets. Even these law-givers did not make the law, as the ultimate law-giver was God himself. The belief was that the law had revealed itself to these persons because of their closeness to God.25 Historians generally agree that ancient 'law- givers' such as Ur-Nammu, Hammurabi, Solon, Lykurgus and the authors of the Roman Twelve Tables did not intend to create new law, but to declare existing law.26 The ruler's duty was to uphold the law, not to make or re-make it.27 When rulers legislated, they purported to purge the law of supposed corruptions. This was the theory. In practice, the ruler did make law out of practical necessity without actually repudiating the myth that the law could not be created. As Kern states, if the law of the mythical law-giver stands in the way of desirable innovations, it would simply be regarded as perverted by corrupt tradition, hence capable of improvement-. The crucial point is that despite being violated by the practice, the theory remained dominant and served as a real constraint on deliberate law making. The Fallacy that all Law is either Natural or Positive The idea that all law which could not be attributed to human authorship must be 'natural', magical, or divinely ordained was common in ancient societies as it is in many present day tribal societies. It has also been entrenched in western philosophy from the time of the Greeks. Hayek argues that this idea resulted from a misleading distinction which crept into early Greek thinking. This is the division of all phenomena into the two 22 B. K. Malinowski, Crime and Custom in Savage Society (1926) 14. 23 F. A. Hayek, Law Legislation and Liberty (1982), vol 1, 74. 12 E.

Originally there were three terms current in Greek thinking. They were physei which meant 'by nature', nomo best translated as 'by convention' and thesei which means roughly 'by deliberate decision'. Physei constituted one side of the division. The other side was alternatively described as nomo or thesei. Nomo potentially represented a third and distinct category, which was neither natural nor artificial. It was a category of phenomena which were 'the result of human action but not of human design'. An example is customary law which emerges as a consequence of the coincidence of human behaviour and not by deliberate design. However, the use of the terms nomo and thesei interchangeably led to this third category being obscured. The result was that all things became classified as either natural or artificial. Since customary law was not deliberately designed, it tended to be regarded as natural. In the second century AD, the grammarian, Aulus Gellius translated the terms physei and thesei into Latin as naturalis and positivus. Most European languages derived their terms for natural law and positive law from this rendition.29 The Evolutionary Theory of Hayek Hayek does not deny that the term law is correctly applied to deliberate enactments having validity in the positivist sense. Rather, his thesis is that there is, apart from legislation, another type of law which is spontaneous in its formation, and that, in order to remain a liberal society, it is important for us to recognize its existence and to comprehend its nature. Unlike most jurisprudential theorists, Hayek develops his theory from an explicitly stated epistemology. The theory develops through a series of dichoto- mies employed to demonstrate key distinctions which have been obscured in traditional jurisprudence. Two types of rationalism-constructivist and critical Hayek says that there are two ways of perceiving human affairs, and depending on which we choose, we arrive at quite different conclusions with regard to our capacity to explain and assist human development. Hayek terms these two modes of thinking: 'constructivist rationalism' and 'critical rationalism'. Constructivist rationalism is rooted in the work of R6ne Descartes. The cornerstone of Cartesian rationalism is the 'radical doubt'. The chief require- ment of the radical doubt was that we should not accept as true anything that could not be logically derived from premises which were clear and explicit. Descartes himself knew that there were things that could not be explained by this mode of reasoning. As a devout Christian, he had no difficulty, attributing these " Hayek op cit, vol 1, 20.</page><page sequence="8">208 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies VOL. 13 things to divine providence. Many of his followers, however, drew from this idea of rationality, inferences suggesting, inter alia, that the only rational actions were those determined by known truth and that all human success results from such rationality. They appeared to suggest that human practices which are not designed with reason are beneficial only by accident.30 This approach ushered in the 'Age of Reason'. Ironically, Hayek argues, it made mankind relapse into earlier anthropomorphic modes of thought which seek to explain phenomena as the results of the design of a thinking mind.31 Hayek has two basic objections to Cartesian rationalism. The first is that the approach is based on the synoptic delusion that all knowledge relevant to determine the efficacy of action is always available to the actor. This simply is not the case. Often knowledge is insufficient to construct the explicit premises from which inferences can be drawn.32 But constructivist rationalists whilst doubt- lessly aware of this problem, frequently proceed as if they command such knowledge. Hayek's second objection is that constructivist rationalism tends seriously to limit many of our most effective means of achieving success. Many human actions are successful, not because the actors know every fact that affects their actions, but because they observe practices or rules which are adapted to the kind of world we live in. These practices are the product of the regularities or coincidences of behaviour on the part of individuals pursuing different ends. Hence they are 'naturally selected'. By following these practices, an individual artificially extends his or her own knowledge.33 Critical rationalism, on the other hand, proceeds on the recognition that human knowledge is irremediably limited. It is based on the concession that many of the rules and institutions in society have evolved through the coinci- dences of human strivings. Critical rationalism holds that these practices and institutions have been persevered with, not because they are true in the Cartesian sense, but because they helped groups to survive.34 Two types of orders-cosmos and taxis Every society displays a degree of orderliness. In fact, it is perhaps truer to say that a group is a society because it has some order.35 What produces the orderliness in society? Constructivist rationalism promotes the idea that all worthwhile social orders are made orders. Hayek argues that this is not the case. He draws a distinction between evolved or spontaneous orders (cosmoi) and made orders or organizations (taxeis). 3o Id, vol 1, 10. 31 Id, vol 1, 9, 10. 32 Id, vol 1, 12-15. 33 Id, vol 1, 14. S Id, vol 1, 8. 3 Thus a group whose members fight each other on sight or flee from each other is not a society.</page><page sequence="9">SUMMER 1993 Evolutionary Theory 209 Taxeis are exogenous orders, created for a purpose, hence deliberately designed.36 Examples of this type of order include the factory, the social club, the university and the most powerful of them all, government. Cosmoi are endoge- nous orders resulting from internal processes. They have no creator, hence no purpose. Hayek draws the important distinction between the purpose of a thing and the purpose for which a thing is employed. The fact that a cosmos may prove very useful to persons pursuing different ends does not mean that the cosmos itself has an ordained purpose.37 Examples of cosmoi include language, the market, moral systems and systems of customary laws. Today, no one seriously thinks that language was created by some genius of the past. But many still believe that all law was deliberately created by past legislators. Human society (as distinguished from state and government) is made up of both taxeis and cosmoi interacting to form an overall cosmos.38 Taxeis or organizations are suited for certain human activities, where purposes are known and the knowledge needed for achieving such purposes can be mastered. Spontaneous orders or cosmoi are more suited to spheres of action where relevant knowledge is dispersed and there is no common purpose but countless individual purposes. A cosmos is end-independent and only provides an order within which individuals can pursue their separate ends. Where individuals need to determine their own ends, the application of organizational norms is inappropriate. The failure to distinguish between these two types of orders have resulted in spontaneous orders being undermined by the application of methods appropriate to taxeis. Two kinds of rules-nomos and thesis An appreciation of the differences between cosmos and taxis leads to an under- standing of the different types of rules which define or characterize each kind of order. Taxis or organization is directed at particular ends, hence the 'rules' of an organization are aimed at securing or facilitating such ends. The governance of an organization is ideally carried out by making particular determinations and by issuing specific commands. But in larger organizations this is not possible. Hence the need for rules. Consider a school. It would be good if the Headteacher could be present in all classrooms and playing fields at all times in order to effectuate the educational and disciplinary objects of the school. But this is impossible. Hence the existence of school rules. But these are rules in a special sense. They are substitutes for particular orders. Hayek calls this type of rules theseis.39 The rules of a cosmos are fundamentally different. They, like the cosmos are end-independent. They are rules applicable to an unknown and indeterminable 36 Hayek, op cit, vol 1, 37. 37 Id, vol 1, 38-9. m Id, vol 1, 46-7. 19 Id, vol 1, 49-50.</page><page sequence="10">210 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies VOL. 13 number of persons and instances.40 They are the outcome of the coincidences of human behaviour, the product of countless individual strivings. They have become rules through the observance of people who have found them conducive to the pursuit of private and variable ends. The rules of a cosmos are not meant to produce particular results. They merely facilitate the pursuit of individual purposes. Consider the market, which is a cosmos in Hayekean theory. One of the rules of the market is that promises should be fulfilled. This rule does not guarantee particular results. But it allows various individuals to pursue disparate ends. The rule is there because of the regularity with which it has been observed in society. It has been observed not because it is perceived as serving some predetermined common object but because it serves countless and variable individual purposes. Hayek terms this type of rule, nomoi or the rules of just conduct. Two kinds of law: private law and public law Hayek does not claim that all nomoi or rules of just conduct which are in fact observed in a society constitute law. Nor does he claim that all that is popularly called law are nomoi. However, he asserts that in a free society, only rules of just conduct or nomoi should be binding on citizens. Rules of organizations should bind only those who are members of such organizations. The organizational rules pertaining to the taxis of government constitute public law and should command the obedience of those who serve the government. To the extent that the rules of public law are to be considered binding, they should be general, abstract and end-independent. The rules of just conduct or nomos on the other hand are to be found in principles of private law. Hayek disputes the common assumption that the private law is derived from public law. He adduces historical evidence and theoretical reasons to argue that public law was initially established only to ensure the conduct of government, including the enforcement of the private law.41 Hayek contends that the failure to understand the distinction between made (taxis) and grown (cosmos) orders and the differences between the rules appropri- ate to each other has resulted in a confusion of private and public law, leading to the supersession of the former by the latter, at the expense of the liberty of the citizen. Two kinds of law-making-common law and legislation Hayek presents the nomos-thesis and the public law-private dichotomies as a part of a general theory of law. These dichotomies characterized legal systems on a universal scale. But it is the English legal tradition (which survived the 40 Id, vol 1, 50. 41 Id, vol 1, 126, 127.</page><page sequence="11">SUMMER 1993 Evolutionary Theory 211 disintegration of medieval feudalism) that best exemplifies the European appli- cation of this theory. Hayek discusses the role of the common law judge in articulating and elevating to legal status, the rules of just conduct. Until recently the development of the private law was in the hands of the common law courts. The common law defined private rights and in doing so laid down the rules of just conduct. Public law on the other hand initially consisted of the Ruler's directions concerning the administration of the realm by his or her subordinates. These directions took the form of legislation or commands of Parliament when the executive measures required incidental infringement of private rights. Thus legislation was primar- ily concerned with the organization of government and only incidentally with the rights of the citizen.' The advent of the welfare state, however, caused a dramatic transformation of the role of legislation. Parliament, under electoral pressure, assumed the role of provider to the community. Providing for the community required organizing resources and regulating private dealings. Thus, the welfare era brought about the legislative era with its massive incursions into the domain of private law. Hayek seeks to demonstrate on legal-theoretical grounds that this supersession of common law by legislation has had a profound impact on liberty. Hayek does not deny the need for legislation. Legislation is sometimes required in relation to tasks for which the rules of a spontaneous order are inappropriate. Legislation is also required to correct the sometimes unsatisfac- tory directions in which the common law develops. But Hayek insists that if liberty is to be preserved, legislation which affects rules of just conduct should themselves imitate nomos. That is to say they should be general, end-indepen- dent and applicable to an indefinite number of unknown future situations. They should not be calculated to achieve particular material results.43 Formal justice and social justice It becomes clear from the nature of nomos, that it cannot produce particular outcomes. If so, they cannot serve as the instruments for the achievements of social justice ends which call for the creation of specific material conditions and for the achievement of specific redistributory goals. The private law can only aim at formal justice, in the sense of securing the observance of the rules of just conduct. Hayek points out that in order to produce the particular outcomes which social justice demands, it is necessary to resort to organizational methods. A specific pattern of distribution can be achieved only by the deliberate co-ordination of all the different activities that go on in society. According to Hayek, this means that if we pursue social justice as opposed to formal justice, we should be reconciled 42 Id, vol 1, 124, 126. 43 Id, vol 1, 88, 89.</page><page sequence="12">212 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies VOL. 13 to a commensurate cost in terms of a diminution in the individual's capacity to pursue his or her own private ends. Hayek argues that the term 'social justice' involves a category mistake. For a person to act justly or unjustly, he or she should be responsible for the outcome in question. The fact that some persons are wealthy whilst others are poor may be regarded as bad. But it cannot be regarded as unjust unless some person or authority is in command of all the activities that affect this situation. Hayek argues that this type of control cannot be achieved within a spontaneous order (cosmos)." It can only be attempted by transforming society into a taxis or organization. It is not Hayek's contention that those who cannot look after themselves should perish. Indeed, he recognized the 'clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organized community' those who cannot help themselves.45 To this end he proposed the provision of an assured minimum income which would form 'a floor below which nobody need to descend'.4" Hayek's aim was to demonstrate that the kind of social justice implicit in the ideal of creating material equality of all cannot be achieved within a spontaneous order. The role of the common law judge Hayek's theory is partly descriptive and partly prescriptive. It is descriptive in the sense that he seeks to portray realistically the ways in which judges and legislators approached their respective tasks in the past, and how they regarded their respective roles in relation to the law. The theory is only partly descriptive because judges and legislators, particularly in modern times, have not behaved always in the manner Hayek describes. Hayek admits this. His object is to demonstrate that liberty is at risk unless: (a) It is recognized that there are two types of law, one (nomos consisting of abstract, general, end-independent and (usually) evolved rules and the other (thesis) consisting of end-specific, deliberately created rules which lack the qualities of abstractness and generality. (b) It is ensured that only the first type (nomos) is coercively enforced against citizens. (c) Judges and legislators, when recognizing, applying or modifying the nomos type of law maintain its qualities of abstractness and generality. In elucidating the evolved nature of nomos or rules of just conduct, Hayek exposes the way in which social rules evolve through the coincidence of individual strivings and are ultimately articulated as law by arbiters (judges) deciding disputes. The regularities of behaviour which produce social rules also create expectations that the rules will be observed for the most part by the members of the community. Disputes arise when these expectations are defeated. Hence, the judge's task is to determine which expectations are 44 Id, vol 2, 68-9. 45 Id, vol 2, 87. 46 Ibid.</page><page sequence="13">SUMMER 1993 Evolutionary Theory 213 legitimate. In so determining, they uphold the rules which gave rise to the legitimate expectations. Hayek explains: Such law may be gradually articulated by the endeavours of arbitrators or similar persons called in to settle disputes but who have no power of command over the actions on which they have to adjudicate. The questions which they will have to decide will not be whether the parties have obeyed anybody's will, but whether their actions have conformed to expectations which the other parties had reasonably formed because they corresponded to the practices on which the everyday conduct of the members of the group was based.47 Hayek acknowledges that in practice, the task of upholding expectations is highly complex. There will always be new situations where established rules are inadequate and one is not sure which expectations are legitimate. There will also be situations where established rules create conflicting expectations. In the first case, the judge distils new rules from inchoate principles generated by earlier decisions. In the second case the judge reconciles the rules, if necessary, by delimiting the range of permitted actions. In such cases the question is not so much, 'what were the legitimate expectations?' but 'what expectations ought to be regarded as legitimate in the future?'. In answering this question, the judge ought to make a rule which maintains rather than undermines the overall order served by the legal system.48 Accordingly, a judge's task is to serve, maintain and improve an ongoing order which nobody has designed. The efforts of judges in resolving disputes are thus part of that process of adaptation of society to circumstances by which the spontaneous order grows. The judge assists the process of selection by upholding those rules which make it more likely that expectations will match and not conflict." Jurisdiction is integral to the process of evolution of a spontaneous legal order. As Hayek states, 'where there exists genuine doubt about what is required by established custom . .. where there exists a real gap in the recognized law a new rule will be likely to establish itself only if somebody is charged with the task of finding a rule which after being stated is recognized as appropriate'.50 One may question whether the connections that Hayek draws between expectations, the overall order and the intricacies of legal reasoning with its commitment to logical consistency has become an autonomous discipline which remains faithful to itself even at the expense of defeating legitimate expectations. This is at least partly true and that is why the Hayekean theory is only partly descriptive. It is possible to claim that to a significant extent, the logical consistency at which traditional legal reasoning aims, represents the efforts of judges to reconcile evolved rules, thereby reducing the chances of expectations being defeated. However, there may arise points beyond which logical consist- ency can only be achieved at the expense of distancing the law from the factual order of actions it is intended to serve.

He states Whether a new norm fits into an existing set of norms will not be a problem solely of logic, but will usually be a problem of whether, in the existing factual circumstances, the new norm will lead to an order of compatible actions. This follows from the fact that abstract rules of conduct determine particular actions only together with particular circumstances. The test of whether a new norm fits into the existing system may thus be a factual one; and a new norm that logically may seem to be wholly consistent with the already recognised ones may yet prove to be in conflict with them if in some sets of circumstances it allows actions which will clash with others permitted by the existing norms. This is the reason why the Cartesian or 'geometric' treatment of law as a pure 'science of norms', where all rules are deduced from explicit premises, is so misleading.51 Hayek's view of the judge's role bears a similarity to Dworkin's theory of what judges do in 'hard cases', but there are important differences. Dworkin argues that even in hard cases decisions are, and should be, generated by principle and not policy. When rules run out, the judge is not free to legislate, but is bound to make a decision that can be justified 'within some comprehensive theory of general principles and policies that is consistent with other decisions also thought right'.52 Compare this with Hayek's statement: Yet although in such situations there will be no known rule to guide him, the judge will not be free to decide in any manner he likes. If the decision cannot be logically deduced from recognised rules, it still must be consistent with the existing body of such rules in the sense that it serves the same order of actions as these rules." Both writers are saying that where there is no clear precedent, the decision should be dictated by principles implicit in the system whose interests the judge, through his decision, must serve. However, on this point, there is a subtle difference between the two theories. The difference relates to the question: what is the relevant system which the judge is bound to serve? In Dworkin's view the system is to be identified by looking at not only precedents but also statutes, and other institutions of the community. In other words, Dworkin's sources of principles would include orders, which Hayek would regard as taxeis. Accord- ingly, some of these 'principles' may not be rules of just conduct in that they may not be general, abstract or end-independent. They may resemble thesis more than they resemble nomos. Hayek maintains that the common law is part of a spontaneous order (cosmos) and hence, it is this order that yields the appropriate principles. There is another important difference between Dworkinian and Hayekean theories of the role of the common law judge. In Dworkin's view, a judge never legislates, as he draws on principles when rules run out. It means that if there is a clear and uncontradicted precedent, the judge has no authority to depart from s5 Id, vol 1, 105-6. 52 R. Dworkin, op cit, 87. 53 Hayek, op cit, vol 1, 115-16.</page><page sequence="15">SUMMER 1993 Evolutionary Theory 215 it.5 This follows from Dworkin's thesis that the litigant has a genuine political 'right to win a law suit'.55 In Hayek's theory, the judge's duty is to serve and maintain the ongoing order. This order, itself, is spontaneously growing, hence the judge needs to recognize and uphold the new expectations generated by this process. The new expectations may conflict with older rules. In such cases, a judge who serves the ongoing order may resolve the conflict by recognizing a new rule or by modifying the old one. To achieve this result, Dworkin's judge would have to first persuade himself that there is no clear and uncontradicted prece- dent, a process which may involve the judge in painfully convoluted reasoning. Is there a spontaneous legal order? Hayek's thesis concerning the role of a judge (in relation to unlegislated law) is based on the view of the law as a spontaneous order. The spontaneous character of the legal order that the judge serves limits his discretion. The judge cannot engage in radical criticism of the order without damaging its spontaneous character. He can only engage in 'immanent criticism'.56 But, is this type of law really a spontaneous order? Marxists claim that all social structures reflect inequalities imposed by the dominant classes. Some feminists claim that many social rules, including those defining the family, have been determined by male interests. One does not have to subscribe to the Marxist or feminist interpre- tations of history to recognize the weight of this objection. It can hardly be suggested that the law, or for that matter any social order, has evolved free of deliberate human interference. The processes of interaction which produce the rules upon which expectations are founded are constantly exposed to the attempts of individuals and groups to coerce and to dominate others. Indeed, Hayek himself reminds us of the way in which the common law has been bent to serve class interests. Speaking of the causes of the distortion of grown law, Hayek says: But the most frequent cause is probably that the development of the law has lain in the hands of members of a particular class whose traditional views made them regard as just what could not meet the more general requirements of justice. There can be no doubt that in such fields as the law on the relations between master and servant, landlord and tenant, creditor and debtor, and in modem times between organized business and its customers, the rules have been shaped largely by the views of one of the parties and their particular interests . .. Thus, does the reality invalidate Hayek's thesis? Could it be argued that past interferences have deprived the law of its spontaneous character, such that there is no longer reason to limit the judge to the role of maintaining the ongoing 54 Dworkin, op cit, 89. 55 Ibid. 56 Hayek, op cit, vol 1, 118. 5 Id, vol 1, 89.</page><page sequence="16">216 Oxford fournal of Legal Studies VOL. 13 order? The appeal of such an argument would depend on the extent to which one believes the law reflects or fails to reflect evolved social practices. If one views the social practices which give rise to law as having little to do with evolutionary processes and much to do with the will of dominant individuals or groups, one may be tempted to claim that a judge should be invested with power to make even radical changes to the order by the projection of his own will. However, radical judicial activism is open to serious objections, irrespective of one's perception of the nature of the law. The chief among them are: the retroactive effect of judicial law-making, the loss of judicial impartiality (or appearance thereof), the lack of democratic legitimacy and the want of legislative skill on the part of judges.ss For these reasons, one may reasonably argue that radical change to the law should only be undertaken by responsible agents acting through democratic legislative processes. The objection to Hayek's theory suggested above, also involves question begging. To appreciate this, we should go back to the fundamentals of Hayek's theory. Hayek asserted that there are two types of orders, cosmos (grown orders) and taxeis (made orders). A dispassionate observance of social structures reveals that there are no completely grown or completely made orders. We have already noted how spontaneous orders are distorted by the projection of sectarian power. It is equally true that a taxis of any complexity or size is likely to manifest features that were never dictated but have grown as a consequence of the behaviour of its elements. A taxis is defined by its creator's design and is operated through commands and, where necessary, through rules which have the character of thesis rather than nomos. However, it is evident in an organization of any complexity, that there are grown practices which supplement the made rules. Some of these may sometimes improve the operation of the organization, while others may subvert its aims. A frequently heard complaint against government bureaucracies is that they tend to develop their own institutional ethics and practices, which are at variance with their stipulated aims and policies." The enormous size and complexity of government means that complete control of its elements is impossible. For expository purposes, Hayek distinguishes between cosmos and taxis in their paradigmatic forms. Yet, he was acutely aware that each type of order carries to varying degrees the properties of the other. In fact he considered that the only order which is entirely spontaneous in character is the overall order of the society.60 Thus, the Hayekean thesis takes explicit account of this reality. The orders that make up the overall society approximate in varying degrees to the paradigms of cosmos and taxis. Hayek's complaint is against the intellectual attitude of regarding all social structures as the results of deliberate action. The gravamen of his thesis is that much of the success of the human race is 51 For an illuminating discussion of these objections, see, Devlin, 'Judges and Lawmakers', 39 (1976) The M1odern Law Review, 1. 59 The institutional irresponsibility which results from the behaviour of the elements within a bureaucracy is one of the recurring themes of the television comedy series Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister. I Hayek, op cit, vol 1, 50.</page><page sequence="17">SUMMER 1993 Evolutionary Theory 217 attributable precisely to the fact that some of its key social structures, including the law, have not been deliberately created, but have been 'naturally selected'. He writes: It is because it was not dependent on organisation but grew up as a spontaneous order that the structure of modern society has attained that degree of complexity which it possesses and which far exceeds any that could have been achieved by deliberate organization. In fact, of course, the rules which made the growth of this complex order possible were initially not designed in expectation of that result; but those people who happened to adopt suitable rules developed a complex civilization which then often spread to others. To maintain that we must deliberately plan modern society because it has become so complex is therefore paradoxical, and the result of a complete misunderstanding of these circumstances."' A judge's duty is to restore the evolved order when conflicts disrupt it. Hence, the judicial role quintessentially involves the prevention of the types of interfer- ences with the grown order which allows sectional interests to dominate. As Hayek notes, judges have not always performed this role with distinction, having even been responsible for the development of the law in directions dictated by their own class interests. The fact that the spontaneous legal order reflects distortions created by sectarian interventions does not necessarily invalidate Hayek's thesis concerning the role of a judge. The presence of these distortions is at least in part due to the fact that judges have not always behaved according to the Hayekean model. (Distortions, of course, may also be caused by the fact that judges have had no opportunity to rectify them, as the conflicts that distortions cause may not have arisen before them for any number of reasons.) So, why should we deny judges the power to rectify the distortions caused by sectarian interventions by resort to radical reform? There are several major reasons for such denial. The first is explicitly stated by Hayek. The others, though implicit in his theory, need to be developed from it. First, once the law has proceeded to develop in an undesirable direction, for a substantial length of time, its rectification by judicial means becomes inappro- priate. The reason is that the community re-orders its behaviour in the expectation that the rule as developed will be observed. As judicial legislation is always retro-active, judges cannot reverse the law without defeating reasonably- held expectations. In these circumstances legislation (which is generally pro- spective in operation) is required to correct the grown law.62 By contrast, judicial development of the law through immanent criticism minimizes retroactive prejudice. Immanent judicial reasoning leads a judge to improve the legal order by laying down new rules when changes in the factual order have caused changes in community expectations. In such cases, the harm of retroactivity is reduced by the fact that the judicial modification of the rule is reasonably foreseeable.63 Some expectations are defeated when a judge is called upon to reconcile evolved 61 Id, 50-I. 62 Id, 88-9. 63 Cf Devlin, op cit, 10-11.</page><page sequence="18">218 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies VOL. 13 rules which run counter to each other, but that is inevitable in a dynamic legal order. Secondly, owing to his training and the inherent constraints of judicial office, the judge is unqualified to undertake radical, as opposed to immanent reform of the law. Immanent reform involves only incremental change. It requires the identification of the factor which is causing the disruption of the ongoing order and the adjustment of the relevant rule to make it fit better into the order. The incremental nature of the reform and the aim of maintaining the ongoing order minimizes the likelihood of unintended repercussions in the factual order of actions. Radical reform, by contrast can have widespread repercussions, which need to be anticipated and provided for. As any lawyer even remotely acquainted with law reform processes will know, major changes to basic legal rules, concepts or institutions require numerous consequential changes to the law. The judicial method simply does not permit the judge to work out these consequential changes. The judge can make law only with respect to the case before him. If he makes a radical change to the law, he must leave the task of working out the consequential changes to judges deciding future cases. While these changes are worked out from case to case (a process likely to take many years), the factual order of actions may be thrown into confusion, defeating reasonably held expectations and causing injustice. The third reason for denying the judge the right to effect radical changes to a grown legal order, is perhaps the most compelling. This reason concerns the loss of democratic legitimacy as the judge moves from immanent reform to radical reform. Immanent reform is constrained and directed by the exiting order. The judge engaging in this type of reform undertakes a pre-dominantly technical or scholarly task, for which he is eminently suited by training. Radical reform, on the other hand, involves highly political questions, which judges are not competent to handle. Before radical reform to a spontaneous order is undertaken, it must be decided that the offending rule is not the natural outcome of the evolutionary process of the law, but is the result of an unjust intervention of a sectional interest. A legislative authority which is subject to democratic account- ability is naturally better suited to make such a judgment. At least in theory, the elective nature of the legislator's office will make the legislator think twice before changing a rule which reflects the community's evolved values. There are other practical reasons, no less important, for limiting the judicial role to immanent reform. Lord Devlin, for example, cogently argues that by engaging in radical law reform (dynamic law making as he puts it) a judge tends to lose the appearance of impartiality which is crucial to his ability to perform his social function ie the removal of the sense of injustice from the community." Radical reform involves the making of policy decisions regarding which there may not be community consensus. It is difficult for a judge to maintain the appearance of impartiality while engaging in such policy making. 6 Id, 2-3.</page><page sequence="19">SUMMER 1993 Evolutionary Theory 219 III The Trident Case a Hayekean decision? When making decisions which significantly modify or change an existing principle of common law, judges rarely justify their actions explicitly in terms of Hartian, Dworkinian, Hayekean, or for that matter, any other kind of jurispru- dence. What is clear from the history of the common law is that judicial rule making is rarely capricious. Jurisprudence seeks to explain the nature of the limits on judicial discretion and Hayek's theory is an important contribution towards this end. Only a wide survey of decisions involving significant judicial lawmaking can tell us the extent to which Hayek's theory is descriptive of actual judicial behaviour. The following analysis of the decision in the Trident Case is not offered as a substitute for such a survey. It is simply one case study which provides us with an opportunity to illustrate the descriptive as well as the prescriptive aspects of Hayek's theory, in the context of a significant judicial innovation of the law. As the analysis shows, the judicial reasoning found in the several judgments bears a rough correspondence to Hayek's thesis concerning the role of a judge. It is not suggested that this correspondence reflects a conscious, or even a non-conscious, application of that thesis. However, it does show that the Hayekean judicial model is not open to the charge that it is too far removed from reality to be theoretically useful. a. Mason CJ and Wilson J Mason CJ and Wilson J, in their joint judgment, determined that the fact that McNiece was not a party to the contract and had not provided consideration would not prevent it recovering the benefit from Trident. In reaching this conclusion, the judges held that the old rules would not apply to a contract of insurance.65 In effect judges created an exception to the common law rules. The judges marshalled an array of policy arguments to support their decision. They noted that these rules have been under seige throughout the common law world, pointing out the criticisms of the doctrines made in the 1937 Sixth Interim Report of the Law Revision Committee, and surveying the legislative ousting of these requirements in many jurisdictions in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. They examined and found wanting the alternative remedies of the action for damages by the promisee, the action for specific performance, the action on the basis of a trust and the use of the doctrine of estoppel. They scrutinized the common justifications of the two requirements and found them unpersuasive. The argument that privity prevents double recovery by the third party and the promisee was met with the statement that the risk may be eliminated by the joinder of all the parties in the first action.66 The argument that privity is an effective barrier to the liability of the promisor to a vast range of 65 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 123-4. " (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 121.</page><page sequence="20">220 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies VOL. 13 potential plaintiffs was considered too far-fetched, except in relation government contracts intended to benefit a class.67 A third argument, advanced by Professor Corbin,68 received more attention. Corbin argues that any recognition of an unqualified right in a third party would have to come at the expense of the rights and liberties which the contracting parties have at common law, such as the liberty to rescind or modify the contract. The judges acknowledge the need to preserve these liberties, but state that the third party entitlement may be subordinated to such liberties.69 In the end, however, the judges rest their case on a rationale which has a strikingly Hayekean ring about it. They stated: In the ultmate analysis the limited question we have to decide is whether the old rules apply to a policy of insurance. The injustice which would flow from such a result arises not only from its failure to give effect to the expressed intention of the person who takes out the insurance but also from the common intention of the parties and the circumstance that others, aware of the existence of the policy, will order their affairs accordingly. We doubt that the doctrine of estoppel provides an adequate protection of the legitimate expectations of such persons and, even if it does, the rights of persons under a policy of insurance should not be made to depend on the vagaries of such an intricate doctrine. In the nature of things the likelihood of some degree of reliance on the part of the third party in the case of a benefit to be provided for him under an insurance policy is so tangible that the common law rule should be shaped with that likelihood in mind.70 It is apparent that the decisive consideration was the fact that 'in the nature of things' members of the public would order their affairs in the expectation that such insurance policies entitle third parties to be indemnified by the insurer. There is a subtle but important distinction to be noted in this passage. The judges are not stating that the new principle they wish to establish will give a third party the entitlement to sue the insurer if such third party had in fact relied on being indemnified. They are not even saying that under the new principle the third party will be entitled to sue only if it is likely that he would have relied on being indemnified. What they are saying is that the new principle is demanded by the fact that the public ('others') are likely to order their affairs on the basis of such an expectation. Thus, the expectations of the community are the basis for changing the law. The new principle would grant the entitlement to a third party who did not place the slightest reliance on the prospect indemnification. Toohey J In contrast, Toohey J, who also recognized the case as an exception to the rules requiring privity and consideration, would concede the right to sue only where it 67 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 121-2. 6 Corbin, 'Third Party Beneficiary Contracts in England', University of Chicago Law Review, vol 35 (1968) 544 at 549. 69 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 122. 70 (1987-1988) 165 CLR at 123-4. Emphasis added.</page><page sequence="21">SUMMER 1993 Evolutionary Theory 221 'is reasonable to expect that such a contractor may order its affairs by reference to the existence of the policy'."' Under this formulation, the third party plaintiff has to prove that in the particular circumstances it was reasonable for him to order his affairs on the expectation that he would be indemnified. It was quite possible for Toohey J to reach this conclusion on the grounds that there is a general expectation in the community that this type of contract indemnified third parties. It is apparent that this consideration significantly influenced his judg- ment. However, his stated reasoning, as we note presently, has a different emphasis. Toohey J devotes a considerable part of his judgment to the purpose of demonstrating that the privity and consideration requirements are, in fact, established principles of common law, contrary to the view expressed by the Court of Appeal. Hence, he concludes that the intermediate court had no authority to change them.72 However, he held that the rules are 'not so well entrenched as to be incapable of change' by the High Court." Toohey J was prepared to recognize the claimed exceptions to the rules because he held the view that the requirements were 'based on shaky foundations' and that they lack support 'both in logic or in jurisprudence'. He found the doctrine logically and jurisprudentially inadequate, for one principal reason, namely, that the doctrine is not an essential element of a contract. He endorsed Lord Reid's comment that it is not a 'primeval or necessary principle of the law of England'74 and Windeyer J's observation that it is not a rule 'which is necessarily inherent in the idea of contract'." He considered that by recognizing the third party's right to sue, the Court would simply be giving effect to the shared intention of the contracting parties.7" Toohey J considered the issue primarily as a question of logic. There was no logical reason why the ius quaesitum tertio cannot be recognized without violence to the central idea of the contract as a bargain. (Toohey J also catalogues the other criticisms of the doctrine without explicitly endorsing them.) His conclu- sion, reached on logical grounds, comes close to coinciding with the conclusion reached by Mason CJ and Wilson J on the grounds of changed expectations in the community. As noted before he differs from the joint judgment in restricting the ius quaesitum tertio to persons who may reasonably have ordered their affairs on the assumption that the ius exists. One may question whether Toohey J abandoned his logical approach at this point. In imposing a limitation on the ius he appears to be focusing on the factual order of actions in the community rather than on the logical consistency of his new principle. The distinction between those who have reasonably relied on the existence of the ius and those who have not, does not follow necessarily from the premise from which Toohey J draws 7" (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 172. 72 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 167. '3 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 168. " Hepburn v A.

The logic breaks down, unless it can be shown that the terms of the bargain discriminated between the two categories of third parties. Thus Toohey J's approach, though primarily dictated by logic, is tempered by his perception of the factual order of actions. He appears to hold by implication that the extension of the ius quaesitum tertio to all categories of persons specified in the contract would not necessarily accord with that factual order. His approach appears at least in part to reflect Hayek's caution against treating the science of law as a pure science of norms. Such departures from logic are not to be condemned. As Hayek states: That the judge can, or ought to, arrive at his decisions exclusively by a process of logical inference from explicit premises always has been and must be a fiction. For in fact the judge never proceeds in this way. As has been truly said, 'the trained intuition of the judge continuously leads him to right results for which he is puzzled to give unimpeachable legal reasons' .77 Dawson J Dawson J allowed the appeal, refusing to recognize the claimed exception to the privity and consideration doctrines. Dawson J spent little time debating the merits of the claimed exception. Having found that the doctrines were estab- lished in the law, he focused attention on the question: in what circumstances should the highest court depart from established law? He described the argu- ment made by McNiece as an invitation 'not so much to engage in judicial creativity as to engage in the destruction of accepted principle'. Adopting the comments of Viscount Simonds'78 and of Sir Owen Dixon,79 Dawson J drew a distinction between the development of the law by the application of established principle to new conditions and the abrogation of the established principles themselves. This is in essence the Hayekean distinction between immanent and radical critiques of the law. While the former is appropriate to the judicial function, the latter should be the task of the legislature."8 Dawson J rationalized this distinction on the ground that the repeal of a settled principle leaves a gap in the law which, a court acting judicially, is unable to fill. The fashioning of any replacement requires the making of choices between competing policy alternatives, a task to which judicial procedures are unsuited.s8 McNiece, however, was not asking the court to reject the two doctrines but to modify them by the recognition of an exception in the case of insurance contracts. In Dawson J's opinion, this was not possible, because the 'rejection of the doctrine of privity of contract by judicial decision could not be restricted 1" Hayek, op cit, vol 1, 116-17. 78 Midland Silicones v Scruttons Ltd [1962] AC 446 at 467-8. 79 'Concerning Judicial Method', Jesting Pilate (1965) 152-158. 8so (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 161. 81 Ibid.</page><page sequence="23">SUMMER 1993 Evolutionary Theory 223 upon any conceptual basis to contracts of insurance'.82 This is again an appeal to logic. The argument may be re-stated as follows: The essence of the doctrine of privity is that only parties to the contract may sue upon it. If being privy is the essential criterion, the recognition of a third-party right must strike at the very heart of the principle, destroying it altogether. It is difficult to see how the exemption of a situation from the operation of a rule can amount to the abrogation of the rule, even in purely logical terms. Alternatively, Dawson J was intending to say: if an exception is recognized with respect to insurance contracts, other similar contracts may also have to be excepted. If this is what His Honour meant, it still did not follow that the rules had to be repealed. Nor did the court have to identify in advance all the possible exceptions, such questions being properly left to future decisions. The judgment of Dawson J reveals the pitfalls in the way of drawing conclusions to legal problems through purely logical deductions. Even if his inferences were logically sound, it does not mean that the decision would necessarily have been right in law, for as Hayek argues, logical consistency among legal norms need not mean that within the factual order, the actions permitted by such norms are also in harmony. Brennan J Brennan J also allowed the appeal refusing to recognize the exception claimed by McNiece. His approach was to ask the question: assuming that the law on this question is unjust, what are the alternative paths by which the heights of justice might be scaled: the path followed by our law for over a century or a new path of doctrine?"8 He comes to the conclusion that the way to scale the heights of justice is to tread the existing path, namely to retain the doctrines of privity and consideration while developing alternative remedies already in existence, such as the action for damages, action on the trust and estoppel.8M His approach is distinctly Hayekean in that he prefers an immanent reform to what he regarded as a radical departure from the established law. There are two main themes in the reasoning which leads Brennan J to this conclusion. One relates to the difficulties 'encountered in propounding a set of rules to condition the proposed exception to the doctrine of privity'. Among the questions that concerned Brennan J were the following: (a) Is the third party's right to sue revocable by the contracting parties without notice? If so, can the right be recognized at all? (b) Should provision be made for irrevocability upon acceptance by the third party? (c) How can double recovery be prevented? 2 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 162. 83 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at.131-2. " (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 140.</page><page sequence="24">224 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies VOL. 13 The second theme relates to the availability of alternative remedies and the desirability of developing those remedies to give effective relief to third parties. He suggests that the promisee may be allowed to recover the full amount owned to the third party, on condition that it is paid over to the third party. He also argues that 'there is no reason to think that a system of law under which a third party's (equitable) right to sue depends on the existence of a trust is less likely to do justice than a system under which the ius quaesitum tertio is admitted.'.85 Brennan J eschews the purely logical approach. His reasoning is directed more to an examination of the potential conflict of norms as they operate in the factual order. He foresees the possibility that the recognition of the claimed exception, while satisfying the expectations of one group may defeat the expectations of other groups. He finds that the existing alternative remedies afford a means of giving relief to third parties without great violence to equally legitimate expectations of the contracting parties. For example, the recognition of an equitable right to the benefit under a trust would ensure that the promisee- trustee and the beneficiary cannot each recover the benefit, thus causing the promisor to pay twice. Deane J Deane J could see no justification for the judicial (as opposed to legislative) alteration of the established legal position. He considered that it had been long settled that 'it is of the very nature of a contract that it does not, of itself, confer any direct right of enforcement upon a person who is not a party to it'.86 He seems to suggest that the task of abrogating fundamental principles of the common law should be left to Parliament. Equally, he suggests that the result in the case flowed logically from the very concept of the contract which is entrenched in the law. However, Deane J managed to offset the potential injustice resulting from his fidelity to logical method by his strongly expressed view that insurance contracts of the type considered in the case would establish a trust under which the promisee would be obliged to hold the benefit in trust for the third party. Gaudron f Gaudron J also refused to recognize the claimed exception to the rules of privity and consideration but achieved a result which is for all practical purposes identical to the position had the exception been recognized. She determined that in relation to the type of contract under consideration, there arises in law an obligation to perform the contractual promise from the fact that the promisor has been unjustly enriched. She stated: 85 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 140. 86 (1987-1988) 165 CLR 107 at 152.</page><page sequence="25">SUMMER 1993 Evolutionary Theory 225 In my view it should now be recognised that a promisor who has accepted agreed consideration for a promise to benefit a third party is unjustly enriched at the expense of the third party to the extent that the promise is not fulfilled and the non-fulfilment does not attract proportional legal consequences. Conclusion The most interesting feature of the Trident Case from the standpoint of adjudication theory, is that the majority and the minority, despite coming to different conclusions, without exception, considered their function to be limited to immanent as opposed to radical reform of the law. Despite its sustained critique of the doctrines of privity and consideration, the Mason-Wilson judgment was fundamentally determined by the perception that the changed expectations within the community required the recognition of the claimed exceptions. It was not a wholesale abolition of the doctrines, but a concession limited to the special circumstances of the insurance contract. Toohey J considered recognition of the ius quaesitum tertio as an improvement dictated by logic-a change to the rules which was entirely consistent with the fundamental principles. The fourth judge in the majority, Gaudron J, saw herself as doing no more than granting relief on an alternative principle which was part of estab- lished law. By contrast, Brennan J appeared to consider the recognition of the exceptions as a departure from the existing path, which would have the result of defeating reasonably held expectations and opted for what he regarded as the fairer solution to the problem, namely the development of the trust concept to provide relief to third parties. Similarly, Deane J and Dawson J, considered that the recognition of the exception would be a radical change which the legislature alone should undertake. Thus, both the majority and the minority, though coming to different conclusions, based their decisions on a common policy of judicial restraint. The Trident Case also illustrates the tension between the demand for legal change generated by new expectations within the community and the demand for logical consistency. Logical consistency is an important value of the legal system. Up to a point it enhances the predictability of the law. However, the Trident Case reminds us of Hayek's caution that logical consistency does not necessarily produce the harmony of actions at which the law aims. Logical consistency or 'elegance' as civil lawyers would call it, has never been the hallmark of the common law system of adjudication. However, the lack of symmetry in the common law on the logical plane may, in fact, reflect its greater correspondence to the factual order of actions. The judgments in the Trident Case do not disclose a theory of adjudication which accounts for the judicial policy of cautious responsiveness to change. That policy has been part of the judicial tradition which has made the common law what it is. Apart from a few notable exceptions, common law judges have not concerned themselves with theories of adjudication. In the past, that attitude</page><page sequence="26">226 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies VOL. 13 was, perhaps, salutory. Then, judges were relatively immune from the political processes. They were largely left alone in the activity of making/recognizing new law. As McHugh J suggests, judges were less vulnerable both to demagogic and to local or pressure group values and priorities."8 The situation is altogether different today. Parliament is the chief innovator of the law. The rules and orders which Parliament makes (or authorizes others to make) are crucially influenced by the lobby-driven politics of modem democracy. Similar pressures are now felt by the judiciary. The pressures threaten to sever the judicial method from its anchorage in precedent and to set it adrift in the stormy sea of modern distributional politics. These pressures can no longer be resisted by appealing to judicial tradition alone. If the common law method, hence the common law itself, is to be maintained, it is necessary to justify the continuing relevance and value of the tradition of judicial restraint. Such a justification can only be mounted on the basis of a general political theory which vindicates judicial immunity from pressure group politics. Hayek's thesis concerning the role of a judge has precisely this virtue. '" McHugh, op cit, 117.</page></plain_text>
