<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Polish Review, Vol. XXXIII No. 1, 1988: 35-53 ? 1988 The Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences SAMUEL SANDLER VERSIONS OF LESMIAN Paul Coates, Words After Speech: A Comparative Study of Romanticism and Symbolism. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1986. Pp. 215. Not much time has passed since the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Boleslaw Lesmian, which occurred on November 7, 1937, and, if his birth certificate is reliable (it is often contested), the one hundred tenth anniversary of his birth will have just passed. Not surprisingly, commemorations dedi cated to Lesmian of some scholarly importance are in the making. In the last three decades, Lesmian's work has become a major subject of Polish criti cism. It is quite likely that Lesmian, along with Norwid, is the most studied and discussed Polish "modern" poet. The reverberations of the year's an niversary reflect Lesmian's still growing poetic reputation. A kind of consen sus already exists that Lesmian is "the greatest of twentieth century Polish poets, and one of the greatest of modern European ones." (P. 99) The Lesmian anniversary will certainly continue the momentum of critical inquiry into his poetry. Much work still lies ahead. There is an urgent need to seek out and make available some parts of this literary output and of sal vaging biographical data which are extremely scarce, in part because of the events which had taken place in the poet's lifetime and after his death, such as the premature deaths of many of Lesmian's contemporaries, family mem bers, and friends during the war. Because of the slow, late efforts to preserve these data, much was lost. Paul Coates' book illuminates the fate of Lesmian's poetry and its present prominence. Admittedly, Coates' collection of essays is concerned with some aspects of "Romantic, Symbolist, and Post-Symbolist poetry in America, Europe and England." He points to some "suppressed continuities between Romanticism and Symbolism and Post-Symbolism," though they seem all but suppressed, as is the case with belief in poetic inspiration, the "dream poem," and the continuity of Romantic "surrealism," to name the main links to which Coates draws cursory attention. In fact, the book is more of a collection of loosely connected, brief essays on particular prob lems in the poetic works of Blake, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Holderlin, as regards Romantic poetry. The interest in American poetry is limited to a 35</page><page sequence="2">36 The Polish Review brief essay on some particular aspects of Emily Dickinson's writings. There is a single, marginal reference to Poe. In brief essays Coates also comments on single problems of the "moderns": Rilke, Trakl, Hofmannsthal, Eliot, and Celan. Legmian receives the most expansive critical treatment. None of the other essays of Coates runs beyond twelve pages while some seventy pages are assigned to the presentation of Lesmian's poetry, roughly one third of the entire book. Because Coates' book addresses Lesmian's life and work in such a large part, it is ironic testimony to the poet's predicament. Under rated in his lifetime (not unlike Norwid), he has come to be presented outside of Poland as a major figure in Polish and European literature. Lesmian is also the only modern Polish poet who, in the last two decades, has become the subject of three comprehensive studies aiming at drawing the attention of foreign readers to a phenomenon of Polish poetry so little known outside of his native land. (The case of Milosz is somewhat exceptional.) Before Coates' essays, extensive books on Lesmian have been written by Marian Pankowski, who was addressing French readers, while an even more vo luminous study was published in English by Rochelle Stone. There are quite striking differences among these three works. What all three authors have in common, however, is their shared conviction that they are bringing to the attention of foreign readers poetic works ranking among the most outstand ing achievements of European poetry of this age; and at the same time poetic works remaining at far removes from this kind of recognition, primarily be cause of the language barrier, which in this instance seems insurmountable. The major novum of Coates' work might be the fact that he engages in an appreciable endeavor to bring Lesmian's poems to the English-speaking reader. One half of the section devoted to Lesmian contains more than a dozen translated poems accompanied by the Polish originals. This enterprise deserves special attention. References to Romanticism abound in Coates' essays on Lesmian's poetry, but?as is unfortunately the case in many other instances?they are very imprecise and muddled. Remarks on Lesmian's relationship to Ro manticism are almost entirely devoid of any concrete distinction and focus. Suffice it to say that as far as major Romantic influences on Lesmian go, Mickiewicz is never mentioned, and only two marginal references are made to Slowacki (one invoking the Romantic imagery of the horseman, the other in connection with the reflection of the Ukrainian landscape in Lesmian's poems). Norwid's name is once dropped with appropriate hints to this pen chant for neologism and "the poetics of silence." Nowhere is any interpre tative link made to Lesmian's poetic practice. I am afraid that the absence of specific references to Polish Romanticism has less to do with the concern not to burden the non-Polish reader with sup plementary erudition and more with Coates' little attention to and lack of</page><page sequence="3">Versions of Lesmian_37 patience for details, and even more so with the general direction of his com mentaries on Lesmian and his poetry. At the same time, however, one should credit Coates for aptly indicating some illuminating convergences of Lesmian's poetic art, themes, and motives with writers and poets with which the non-Polish reader is more familiar. Thus, the critic compares convinc ingly some stylistic procedures of the Imaginist poets with those of Lesmian. Though the Polish poet certainly knew nothing about these English and American poets, he did share with them some common features directly op posed to symbolism. These poets, as well as Lesmian, owed much to the Symbolist heritage, yet clearly went beyond Symbolist practice and their ten ets of poetic language and imagery. Another quaint though cogent connection mentioned by Coates is that be tween the poetic imagery of Lesmian and Proust. The critic brings to the reader's attention the French novelist's splendid, dreamlike evocation of the image of the "non-existent girl," which also appears frequently in sev eral of Lesmian's greatest poems. In both instances the unknown and im agined girl is presented against an impressively picturesque natural land scape. The similarity of this image in Proust's novel and in Lesmian's poetry is quite conspicuous, more so because both writers belong to the same in tellectual and literary generation and somehow share a kindred sensibility, philosophical and social background, and, last but not least, a common admiration for modern artistic and poetic phenomena, notably Symbolist and Impressionist poetry and painting. This seems as important, if not more per tinent, than Coates' conjecture that it reflects "a link between the private mythologies of Lesmian and Proust." (P. 140) Coates' interpretation of Lesmian's poetry is conceived by the author as a kind of theoretical and methodological novum, manifestly "subversive" with regard to past critical approaches. Although he echoes a variety of critical attitudes, strategies, and techniques, his reading of Lesmian's work rests ul timately on the firm idiosyncratic response of a reader who displays his own responsive literary performance as much as he does that of the poet. Coates' indebtedness ranges from traditionalist empiricism and "close reading" to structuralism, "reader response criticism," and, most extensively, decon structionist criticism (itself already notably variegated). One also detects that Coates has adopted some tenets of feminist criticism and, admittedly, vari ous shades of Marxist criticism, from its orthodox stance through Adorno to its recent Anglo-American versions. Yet, his most dominant influences seem to be those of deconstructivist criticism inspired by Derrida on one hand, and the Laeanian psychoanalytical applications of literary criticism on the other. For better and for worse. Coates applies to LeSmian some themes which are rather redundant in criticism: the mirror image, "otherness," being and non-being, reversion and negations of implied meanings, etc. He resorts to</page><page sequence="4">38 The Polish Review the deconstructionist favorites: word plays,1 puns, and linguistic games. Not unlike Derrida in his witty discussion on Plato's pharmakon (at once a re medy, recipe, poison, drug, and philtre), he tries to revert Lesmian's mean ings of tautology and negative linguistic categories into something puzzling and disturbing, going daringly against the grain of Lesmian's explicit and implicit poetic pronouncements. This is quite blatant in his interpretation of Urszula Kochanowska, Lesmian's most popular poem due to its obvious ref erences to Kochanowski's Treny (Laments). Coates claims that the poem moves "from the casual opening to the shattering close [that] takes one's breath away." (P. 116) Yet, even the first line of the poem is not as relaxed as Coates would have us believe: "Gdy po smierci w niebiosow przybylam pustkowie" (emphasis added), by its syntactic inversion and the verse's final noun, cautions against reading the opening line as a casual one. A reading closer to the source of Lesmian's thematic inspiration, of which the reader must be aware in order to understand the poem, makes for a less "shattering close" and evocation of "horror and hysteria" than Coates implies, (p. 115) though there is no arguing that the poem is "intensely dramatic" (all of Lesmian's mature poetry could be described in these terms). To the reader 1 Coates' speculations on the pen name which Lesmian assumed may already give a foretaste of his critical interpretation. These speculations are in tune with the post-structuralists' playful fad, probably initiated by Derrida in his linguistic and semantic musings on his own name and on that of Francis Ponge, and imitated by a host of other critics (e.g. Terry Eagleton's medi tations on his first name in its association with the adjective "terrible"). Coates treats this as a complete change of the last name, which is certainly not the case. We might agree that such speculations on names sometimes provide interesting insight, and Derrida is probably correct when he states that "the name is not supposed to signify anything, yet it does begin to sig nify." Some more than others. The penchant for amateurish linguistic etymology of names was well documented among the Romantics, and the significations of names like Adam (Mickie wicz), Slowacki, and Norwid were of great interest, particularly to their owners. Lesmian's as sumed pen name, melodious and semantically suggestive as it is, yields readily to linguistic sig nification. Indeed, two of Coates' observations are true: the pen name is phonetically not far removed from the original name (Lesman), and the former has its compound roots in forest (las) and name (miano). Coates maintains that "the name change carried out by Boleslaw Lesmian indicates an existentialist desire to give birth to himself?perhaps an attempt to cut the cords linking him to the dark yellow star of the Jew's fate." (P. 141) This insipid supposition gives way to another, based on the observation that the "new name" is almost identical with the old one. In Coates' reasoning, this takes on a nearly tautological identity, and this in turn leads straight to the "Oedipus complex, that fundamental experience of Lesmian's epoch, as documented by Freud." (P. 141) Coates overlooks or neglects a host of facts in this avalanche of unverifiable assertions and speculations. Coates cares little how LeSmian came to assume this pen name. He presents it as a thoroughly premeditated and elab orate transformation made by Lesmian. In fact, as the poet states himself, the suggestion of as suming the pen name, Lesmian, came from his friend and mentor, Antoni Lange, himself of Jewish origin. Lesmian was then a young poet barely starting out. Such inconspicuous origins of the pen name, Lesmian, could hardly serve as a springboard for the odd suppositions and unproven conclusions which Coates sets forth.</page><page sequence="5">Versions of Lesmian_39 familiar with Kochanowski's Laments this poem reveals philosophical po lemics crucial to the perception of the poet's overall philosophy and world view. Urszula Kochanowska refers particularly to sections in the last part of the Laments, entitled Sen (The Dream), which extol the well-being of the child in the afterworld and opposes this to the adversities and pains of earthly existence. Coates' reading aims at demonstrating that Lesmian's poem "in sists strongly upon the simultaneous identity of life and death, of heaven and earth." (P. 113) In this instance it seems that just the opposite is true. Lesmian's poem speaks for life, for fidelity to it; it clings to it against the most appealing afterworld illusions. Heaven might be rearranged to look identical to the real Czarnolas, but it lacks its most essential quality. Coates' interpretation overlooks the poem's genuine poignancy, replacing it rather carelessly and willfully with spurious assumptions and assertions based on the concept of identity and negation in Lesmian's poetry. In the case of Urszula Kochanowska, the problem is that the critic reads into the poem specifics which he has assumed beforehand in the broadest of general terms. Coates also contends that Lesmian radically reverses the link between the world and the word and that "the world transforms the word itself into a material thing: the dialectical reversal that transmutes spiritualizing idealism into material ism." (P. 139) What looks at close range like a transfer of Derrida's deliberations on taut ology (in La Carte Postale it is claimed that tautology "never goes any where, never advances a single step") appears in Coates' commentaries on Lesmian as a kind of definition of the poet's uses of tautology, only more extravagantly formulated: "Lesmian's tautological ontology both frantically denies that reality has become displaced from itself and re-enacts this dis placement: if everything were really what it is, there would be no need to say so. Tautology is its own worst enemy." (P. 144) Coates corroborates tau tology by his remark that it implies "the impotence of the imagination in capable of choice." (P. 144) The critic contrasts the presence of tautology in Symbolist and post-Symbolist poetry in general with its presence in Lesmian's work. Tautology is a linguistic reflection of Symbolism's and post-Symbolism's helplesness in coping with the reality of the overpowering bourgeois society. In the days of yore?Coates asserts?the presence of tau tology meant something entirely different: "It is possible," he speculates, "that the colonial energy of Britain derived in part from the frequency of this grammatical form in English, which permits the object to act out its be ing; it is as if the object (like England itself, and like the noun assumes the role of the verb) has an innate tendency to overrun its own borders." (P. 142) For Symbolists and post-Symbolists, tautology reveals the impotence of the imagination, but Lesmian is rescued as a creative poet; in his work "active tautology founds an hermetic world of youth, and represents mod ernism in its active phase, before it fell victim of old age." (P. 142) These</page><page sequence="6">40 The Polish Review distinctions between active and passive tautologies, the modernism of youth and of old age, serve a momentary purpose and acquire a clearly provisional status. One does not even know in what sense the term modernism is here employed. It must be implied that Coates refers to "modernism" as a liter ary period most evident in Anglo-American literature. Even so, the dates do not agree. After all, Lesmian wrote poetry until 1937. Would this place him in the youth or the old age of modernism? As a rule, Coates does not seem concerned with such niceties of elucidation, and self-contradictory assertions are admittedly not something worth worrying about. At the outset of his commentaries on Lesmian's poetry the critic affirms: "only self-contradic tory criticism can read him without repressing the vital diversity of his work." (P. 101) On another occasion he advances the opinion that "critical speculations" can be the sole response to poetic work, though they must be considered as "the aura around the poem" and "never actually coincide with it." (P. 14). Such critical methodology is a frank confession that this critic, while stimulated only by the text, is not in the business of "conven tional" critical elucidation and interpretation of literary texts, but of repro ducing, creating?if one prefers?his own meanings, or proposing his very own strategies of readings or "rewritings." A case in point is Coates' read ing of the poem Przyspiew, which many critics have already discussed as one of the most significant for Lesmian's philosophy and poetic strategies. In this poem Coates wants to see the re-enactment of the process by which Lesmian displaces the real world for the invisible, infinite one. This is alleg edly reflected in these often quoted lines: Z Ibem na lapie chudy pies Spi po fapy owej kres, Jakby na niej si? Swiata konczylo bezdroze which Coates renders quite appealingly Head on paws the skinny dog Sleeps at paws end like a log As //the trackless earth stopped at that point! (emphasis added) Those reading Coates' translation can see how far-fetched is the critic's assertion that "realistic description eats reality away in the name of blank potentiality." (P. 108) This is supposedly confirmed also by the final lines, which are not translated as felicitously as the earlier parts of the poem, though they convey the basic idea of the poem: Let the heat and wind increase Forest and ravine increase Along with all things else which yet may be! For Coates this ending of the poem constitutes the poet's epistomological defeat: "For by the end the invisible world has broken through the surface</page><page sequence="7">Versions of Lesmian_41 of the visible one: the last lines intimate a nameless becoming akin to the abstract storm wind of the duree in Bergson." (P. 110) I would argue that the interpretation of the entire poem, along with its final lines, constitutes a patent instance of misreading informed by pre-set assumptions and forced interpretations imposed on the poem. A vitalistic, life and nature affirming poem is read as if it were its extreme opposite. For Lesmian the storm (as he has translated the Bergsonian elan vital) is not abstract. In 1910, even before he had published his first volume of poetry, Lesmian had already in terpreted Bergson's philosophy as a way of perceiving reality in a concrete way, direct and even individual. Bergson sees his reality, in Lesmian's words, "in the permanent stream of existence" that is "impossible to seize" (w nieustannym, niepochwytnym potoku istnienia). This reality cannot be perceived by the intellect and can only be captured?as Lesmian wrote else where?by the instinctive perception of life "in its totality." That which is a display of Lesmian's fundamental reaffirmation of fidelity to life and reality, of its movement, of the eternal creation and self-creation of the world, is presented by Coates as an expression of bleakness and gloom. Dejection and melancholy are not absent from LeSmian's world and work, yet he also cherished, as he stated on several occasions, the "serene, fairy-tale attitude toward life," as he put it in a letter to a Czech poet. In Lesmian's poetry there are glints of joy, humor, playfulness. Coates consist ently overlooks them, even in the poems he discusses in some detail. He also fails to notice another of its significant traits, namely the title, the critic translator renders it into English as Refrain. This is, indeed, the first deno tation that comes to mind, but the word "przyspiew" has some other conno tations important for Lesmian and played out here, notably: "singing along," "accompanying the chorus," and, by extension, "assenting with," "confirmation" (preswiadczenie, przytakiwanie). This word was used in all of these meanings by Mickiewicz (in a ballad known by heart by several generations of Polish children), Krasinski, and several other Polish poets with whom Lesmian was very familiar. Even if we assume that Coates does not know these related meanings of the noun "przypiew," they merely reinforce the overall meaning of the poem and point to its texture and suggested perception, with which Coates' reading is so radically at variance. This is also true of Coates' discussion of one of Lesmian's most serene poems, W polu (In the Field). To the critic this is "an object lesson" in how "nature poetry brings tragedy to Utopia under a single roof." (P. 120) The way in which Coates approaches this poem seems like an obstinate, misguided adoption of Empson's celebrated analyses of Marvell's The Garden and of de Man's polemical corroboration on this subject. Empson reveals that in Marvell's poem, behind the appealing image of the unity of man with nature, lurks a movement toward this unity's annihilation. De Man, on his part, carries this analysis toward existential</page><page sequence="8">42 The Polish Review conclusions of perpetual separation. But does this mode of interpretation fit this particular poem of Lesmian? For this reader "In the Field" is an intense evocation of the joys of sensuality that permeates this erotic and pastoral poem. The poem begins in this mood, and, as I see it, the mood is sustained throughout the entire poem: Dwoje nas w ciszy polnego zakatka Strumien na oslep ku sloricu sie pali The two of us in this field's corner The stream burns blindly toward the sun The poem goes on to its very end in this calm and lucid manner. To Coates, however, the syntax of the poem progresses with "drugged careful ness as the relative clauses create a sense of expectation and mingling, and the often isolated participles embody timeless actions in another world, per ceived through the keyhole in this one." (P. 122) Coates completely ignores the serene atmosphere of the poem, which is reinforced by Lesmian's stra tegically positioned nouns, which are not diminutives, yet imitate them in their lexical structure (zak^tek, latka, plotka, brzmiki, gozdziki); the poem is saved from all sentimentality, yet it preserves a gentle, mellow mood. To further justify the objections to Coates' reading, one could quote the entire poem, which is fortunately reprinted in the book and accompanied by an English translation. Referring to the first stanza, however, which seems so ominous to the critic, might suffice: I bed? patrzal jak maki i szczawie Mdleja, ciat naszych odurzone wonia I bed? wodzil twoja biala dlonia Po wielkiej trawie, nie znanej nam trawie And I will watch the poppies and sorrel Grow faint beneath our bodies perfume And I will trail your white hand through The grass expanse, the unknown grass2 The poem?claims Coates?is "shot through with signals of frustration" which allegedly reflect the absence of the other lover. The description of nature?he maintains?"teases and torments us" by its mingling of "ob jectivity and magic anthropomorphism." (P. 123) Following earlier criticism (Olkusnik, Przybylski) Coates indicates Lesmian's ambivalent attitude to nature, his fascination with its creative power, and his distrust of it. In 1911 he had already conveyed with uncon ?This last line would be literally closer to the original if it sounded: "The grass expanse, the grass unknown to us."</page><page sequence="9">Versions of Lesmian_43 cealed pride to his lifetime mentor, Zenon Przesmycki-Miriam, his own "re discovery" of nature. He joyfully announced that "nature has acquired in my poems the capability of seeing," and that is "already [...] able to look at me as well as I am able to look at it." In his poetry this sense of identity mingles with the poet's mistrust of nature as an all-absorbing force which destroys individuality, the distinctive identity of man, a force which threat ens?in Rymkiewicz's words?"the sovereignty of human existence." But is this sinister side of nature present in "In the Field"? Coates speculates that "the two of us" in the poem may be "a single div ided mind." This gives way to further assumptions that "the plentitude of nature may be coded eroticism, or it may indicate that when human re lationships are frustrated nature becomes full: the poet bestows on nature the love he is too shy to offer the others, as it were. The richness of nature feeds on the absence of man." (P. 123) And finally, Coates offers a reading of the above quoted last two lines of the poem: "When the poet speaks of running the white hand of the other across unknown grass, a strange transference of meanings occurs: the hand itself becomes unknown." (P. 123) Similar speculative surmises, which more often than not are transformed into assertive contentions, are formulated by Coates in his remarks on Lesmian's famous poem, "Transformations" (Przemiany). This splendid poem indeed reveals Lesmian's ambivalent attitude toward nature, his obses sion with its creative powers and its threatening aggressiveness. Noticing this, however, Coates shifts the discussion of the poem to a murky commen tary of the poet's "night self" reflecting Lesmian's "fear of the feminine principle within the self." This is supplemented by a supposition that "a variety of sublimated transvestism may prompt Lesmian to dream of occupy ing the body of a woman?a body that will be attractive, unlike his own." (P. 117) These rather strange assumptions are quoted here to signal a particular string of presumptuous statements and assertions which Coates offers in his commentaries on Lesmian and his poetry. Coates undertakes a radical reversal of the reading of Lesmian's poetry. Previous critics, in his opinion, repressed beings that they are and eager "to shore up their own authority" (p. 101), have totally missed the complexities, dialectics, and polisemic character of the poet's work. "No analysis I have encountered," assures Coates, "ever proposes more than one meaning." (P. 101) This statement is rather surprising given Coates' familiarity with the critical writings on Lesmian. Quite a few instances which defy this conten tion spring immediately to mind. The studies on Lesmian's poetry by Glo wiriski, Lapinski, Slawihski, Rymkiewicz, Przybylski, not to mention those of Sandauer and Trznadel, are all known to Coates, and they all emphasize this feature of Lesmian's poetry and almost always propose more than one reading of any poem which they have examined closely.</page><page sequence="10">44 The Polish Review On his part Coates does not engage in any single and concrete or even thorough analysis of any of Lesmian's poems. His commentaries on them are extremely fragmentary and selective. Like his discussion of Lesmian's poetry as a whole, Coates' remarks on individual poems are almost always made in leaps and bounds with no discernible concern for substantiating his contentions and conclusions. More often than not, they are chains of misty, cryptic sentences helplessly disjunctive, frequently marred by unbridled di gressiveness. In the style of some post-structuralist literary criticism, Coates draws quite indiscriminately from the numerous variations and modifications of psycho analysis. He readily espouses tenets of orthodox Freudianism and of its psychoanalytical opponents (e.g. Adler), but he primarily echoes the La canian approaches to literature. In his analytical, or rather quasi-analytical, commentaries on Lesmian's poetry in general or on specific poems, he pro pounds utterly narrow psychoanalytical meanings for both Lesmian's specific poetic devices and for the specific poems he chooses to dwell upon. He is anything but discriminating in his application of psychoanalysis to Lesmian's poetry, yet he j&gt;ives priority to those versions of psychoanalytical literary criticism which one would think would seem the most discredited. Coates treats Lesmian's poetic texts either as unconscious revelations of the poet's repressed psyche or as outright private confessions. In effect he produces a rather crude psychoanalytical case study based mainly on Lesmian's poetic works. He argues that it constitutes an enigma at which only the psycho analytical interpreter can glance. Coates insists that even the poet's "appar ently 'interpersonal' poems are profoundly self-referential." (P. 117) The organizing patterns of Lesmian's ballads, fairy tales, and epic forms like the poetic tale, pastoral, etc., are completely overlooked. The poems are "ana lyzed" as coded revelations of Lesmian's psyche. To the critic Lesmian is merely concealing his own repressed desires, obsessions, and hallucinatory dreams in one form or another, one genre or another, or, finally, in one poetic device or another. It would take a great deal of extremely careful and intricate study to de termine where Lesmian's poetry and poetic art meet and incorporate his pri vate experience. Yet, with unprecedented audacity and little concern for de tail and evidence, let alone proof, Coates mixes a host of Lesmian's poems with events and situations from his private life and psychological processes, conscious and unconscious, to which the critic seems to consider himself privy. Coates' remark on jealousy in Lesmian's poems contains a paradigm of this approach. "The recurrent theme of jealousy in his work," he main tains, "reflects the feeling of the voyeur observing pleasures he cannot attain to in person?and who, even when he does partake of pleasures, is so embar rassed by his body as to feel he is watching somebody else, his own double." (P. 136) This example brings us to the gist of Coates' reinterpre</page><page sequence="11">Versions of Lesmian 45 tations of LeSmian's self and its reflection in his poetry. Well within the spirit of orthodox Freudianism, Coates emphasizes the centrality of sexuality in his examination of Le&amp;nian's self, though on very rare occasions does the critic sway toward Adler's analytical tenets. He resorts to this most ob trusively while discussing the poet's inferiority complex. This even becomes grounds for positing a parallel between the poetry of Lesmian and Keats. In the works of both of these poets Coates detects the effect of their physical deficiency, i.e. shortness (p. 133). Coates' primary investigation, however, moves towards Lesmian's latent and repressed sexuality. Thus, in the course of his examination of Lesmian's poetry he detects the poet's sexual frus trations (p. 117), voyeurism (p. 118), sadism (p. 119), fetishism (pp. 116, 139), Oedipal complex (p. 141), and necrophilia. These are attributed to Lesmian based either on indiscriminate speculations on his texts or on bio graphical guesses and spurious premises which are supported by no data whatsoever. Even when Coates refers to specific facts in Lesmian's biogra phy, he twists them to the point of utter distortion. That personal sexual motifs are present in Lesmian's poetry has already been shown. The first to point this out was Arthur Sandauer, whom Coates follows with overzealous ardor. Coates takes up this theme from the Polish critic and treats his amateurish Freudian conjectures as self-evident truths. Not by sheer coincidence do both Sandauer and Coates advance their conjec tures about Lesmian's sexuality by reading the famous poem "The Saw" (Pila). Coates, in particular, does not take note of the poem's ballad form and of the fact that the motif of the poem, the woman-saw, is probably adopted from Polish folklore (Trznadel). We might also add that the motif of vengefully tearing assunder the seducer's body can be found in one of Mickiewicz's ballad/narratives, and that Lesmian's text clearly alludes to its images. Granted, this does not explain Lesmian's exploitation of the adopted motifs and imagery in his ballad, but skipping over the presence of these inspirations from folklore and Mickiewicz and rushing into treating the poem as a personal revelation seem utterly unjustified. At least Sandauer claims, more cautiously though unconvincingly, that the necrophiliac and sadistic motifs in Lesmian's poetry constitute some kind of camouflage for the au toerotic ones. He offers a rather captious argument that in Lesmian's lifetime the autoerotic motifs were considered more risky and less decorous, while the former were already accepted due to the folkloristic and Romantic tradition, which exploited them quite frequently.3 3 Lesmian's critics have long emphasized the remarkable explicitness of his erotic poetry and its daring sexual imagery, locutions, and allusiveness. In Coates' extremely strained reading of Lesmian's works, these features are explained as associated with or stemming from the poet's libidinal drives and obsessions. The most disturbing effect of Coates' mode of interpretation is the failure of preserving the autonomy of LeSmian's poetic pronouncements. Furthermore, this</page><page sequence="12">46 The Polish Review Coates' attempt to reconstruct Lesmian's psyche, let alone his uncon scious, proceeds with disregard for the scarcity of biographical data and of ten makes its claims on the basis of bewildering assumptions and correlations supposedly elicited from readings of Lesmian's poetic texts. A good example is the commentary on the poem "The Girl" (Dziewczyna), which is con sidered by many critics to be one of his most magnificent. Coates shares the admiration for this poem and admits correctly that it suggests many mean ings. As noted by Wyka and Glowinski before Coates, the poem brings to light ontological and epistomological concerns central to Lesmian's philos ophy. In this case, however, Coates seems to have little interest in these matters. Nor does he notice the poet's manifest ethical concerns, his ardent defense of human dreams and creativity, his reaffirmation of the irrepressible quest for knowledge, and his compassion for the human attempt to transcend the barriers of the material world. Almost all the wealth of the poem's inter pretative potentialities, which will always leave the reader with a residue of the inexplicable, somehow dissipate in Coates' reading and give way to one aspect starkly epitomizing the critic's approach to Lesmian's poetry. Coates seems to be most drawn to the allegedly biographical contents of the poem which have to do with the "non-existent girl." In the critic's opinion the latter "represents the impossible synthesis of Lesmian's wife and his mis tress" and evokes "the semi-real lover conjured by the onanist." (P. 102) Of course, by this token the poem reflects the poet's "sexual frustration." (Pp. 116-117). These remarks are interwoven with an utterly idiosyncratic commentary on the action of the ballad, on the action of the twelve brothers, on their shadows and hammers which try and ultimately succeed in destroy ing the walls in order to reach the "non-existent girl." As has been said, the action of the ballad suggests a host of meanings. In Coates' interpretation it accounts for the following: ". . .the hammer fetishes are unable to pierce the virgin's vaginal wall; there is no 'person' behind any voice, not even that of the poet; compulsive repetition transforms action into the phantom of action?but the most remarkable thing about it is the way it combines para dox and tautology, disruption and monotony. The tautological hammering is the fruit of a series of paradoxical survivals, and life finally migrates into a single fetish, the hammer." (P. 120) The reader might expect some justifi cation from the critic or corroboration of his reading, an explanation of the mode of interpretation deprives Lesmian of important historical merits within Polish poetry. It has been quite some time since it has been observed that his daring and exuberant erotic poetry occupies an exceptional place in Polish poetry (Jastrun, Lapiriski). For a while, some of his poems clashed with conventional notions of decorum in "high poetry" and vexed some critics. One can still find remarks about the "exhibitionist" imagery in Lesmian's poetry. On one hand such remarks reflect the rather traditional shyness and inhibitions prevalent in Polish literary history, on the other such reservations stem from critical normativism and obsolete notions of decorum.</page><page sequence="13">Versions of Lesmian_47 basis of these conclusions, why the hammers are fetishes, why the wall is a vaginal one, why it is assumed that the repetitions are compulsive, why the action is considered a "phantom action" (is any action so in a ballad?). The questions one can ask go on and on, but this is nearly all Coates contributes to the recent interpretations of the poem. Coates is admittedly indebted to Sandauer's insinuation that the "non-existent girl" in the poems is somehow linked with Lesmian's alleged autoeroticism. But one should narrowly qualify this indebtedness: Sandauer's supposition?calculated for spectacular effect rather than for verifiable qualities, as are many of his critical pro nouncements?is supplemented by a remark that this motif has a rather meta physical meaning. Coates dwells extensively on Lesmian's expressive use of some linguistic, poetic, and rhetorical devices, particularly on his frequent use of neologism, negative linguisitic formations (Lesmian's famous negative prefixes), and paradoxical, grotesque and dreamlike imagery?all hallmarks of Lesmian's poetic art. Many critics have examined these features closely in the past, but Coates does take a special tack to all previous considerations, though this tack is not surprising given the signalled direction of the critic's commentaries. Lesmian believed that creative imagination expressed in poetic language, which he considered the very core of language itself, its "primordial" stratum, has immense creative and cognitive power. This symbiosis gives the poet the most immediate sense of reality, of the world and its mysterious unity, a sense of its perpetual self-creation and transformation. The essential el ements of creative poetic language, which for Lesmian are rhythm (per ceived in the vast sense, not just as a formal device) and the word, enable the poet to reanimate nature, to experience and perceive the world as a living entity. Lesmian consistently insisted on this in his essays and pointed it out explicitly and implicitly in many poems. He contended that poetry can reflect the perception of the real world unimpeded by any mediating conceptual and doctrinal deformation. This capacity for poetic creativity and cognition caused Lesmian to believe in the supreme value of poetry, to view it?as Irzykowski observed?as "the most genuine sense of life." Coates' observations on the poet's most expressive poetic device take little note of Lesmian's poetic art. Coates contends that he goes to the psychologi cal (or, at times, historical) core of Lesmian's poetry and his uses of particu lar devices. Thus, taking his cue from Barthes's description of neologism as an erotic act, Coates argues that Lesmian's use of neologisms is a reflection of his "linguistic eroticism," which is, according to the critic, "soaked in necrophilia, aflame with lust for dead words." (P. 140) He also associates Lesmian's neologistic creativity with fetishism and the castration complex. In this spirit Coates, with a penchant for shocking formulations, ascertains that Lesmian's neologisms are "words that are not words." (P. 138). Else</page><page sequence="14">48 The Polish Review where, Coates offers another explanation for the presence of neologisms in Lesmian's poetry: "The neologisms that dot his poems are fetish words that seek to restore the penis, the power of fecundation, to the castrated body of language: to the Polish language emasculated by the partitioned powers and to the language of Romanticism, cheapened by century's blind repetitions." (P. 106). Other explanations of Lesmian's uses of neologisms are his provin cial upbringing (pp. 137-138), modernist notions of femininity (p. 132), and the "modernist distrust of words" (p. 113). Coates also maintains that Lesmian's intensive use of neologisms "was caused doubtless (...) by th? spectral afterlife the Polish language led in the Russified schools of the late nineteenth century, under the pressure of Czarist revenge for the 1863 upris ing." (P. 131) Coates' references to social, political, national, and cultural facts are seldom recognizable, obscured, as they are, by hyperbolic descrip tions and formulations. There is precious little basis, for example, for such moribund metaphors about the "after-life" of the Polish language at the time of Lesmian's youth. Indeed, the Polish language was brutally limited by the Russian occupants, particularly in education, but at the same time robust forces were working for its survival and development, most notably in literature, journalism, and publishing. Besides, in the Austrian section of Poland, at this very time, Polish was well established as the official language of the whole province, in the schools, the two universities, and in the admin istration and political life of this section of the partitioned country. But Coates, as is almost always the case, excessively emphasizes one feature, isolating it and omitting other parts of the picture. "It is surely significant," he argues, referring to the predicament of the Polish language, "that Espe ranto was devised by a Pole and that by the end of the nineteenth century it has become possible for one of the greatest of all Polish writers?Joseph Conrad?to compose in a completely alien tongue." (Pp. 131-132) To use the critic's own terms, even the most "fiercely patriotic Pole" would not attribute these facts to the vicissitudes of the Polish language. Other relevant aspects of Lesmian's art have received similar treatment. Some Polish critics (most incisively Glowiriski) have indicated the conver gence of Lesmian's poetic art and imagery with cinematic techniques. This convergence is enlightening for Lesmian's philosophy as well as for his poetics. Coates seems to know this, but his interest in the subject takes him in a quite different direction: "It is hardly surprising," maintains Coates, "that Lesmian, domiciled in Kiev, should have employed methods remi niscent to the Russian cinema of the twenties." (P. 110) One must wonder how and why these two things are brought together. There is no examination of this curious link; instead the critic offers extended theoretical digressions on the techniques of Soviet cinema of the 1920's which acquire a life of their own. Coates discusses the presence of the grotesque in Lesmian's poetry in the same manner. Like other critics, he emphasizes the centrality of the gro tesque in the poet's work. However, he is not as interested in the particular</page><page sequence="15">Versions of Lesmian_49 nature of Lesmian's grotesque, its literary and folkloristic background, etc., as he is in how well it fits in with the theoretical descriptions (and defi nitions) of the grotesque proposed by Keiser and Bakhtin. In concluding an argument that is utterly flimsy and strained, Coates pro claims that Bakhtin's definition of the grotesque sits better with Lesmian's poetic practice than that of Keiser. Perhaps, but what one is most struck by in this vapid discussion is the odd justification to which Coates subscribes: "Writing in Poland, but affiliated to Russian symbolism, Lesmian is sus pended between opposed traditions: democratic individualism and autocratic collectivism." (P. 112) Why does Lesmian's "affiliation" with Russian symbolism make Bakhtin's concept of the grotesque pertinent, and why does it identify him with autocratic collectivism? I am afraid that Coates is con cocting a rather bizzare tableau based on deceptive data and assumptions. While pointing to the fact that Lesmian has written and published several poems in Russian, Coates claims that the poet's "first published verses were in Russian." (P. 113). This is completely at variance with the fact that Lesmian started out as a Polish poet; and his debut did not take place in Chimera, as Coates maintains; he began publishing his poetry at least five years before the first issue of Chimera came to print. Furthermore, Lesmian's two series of Russian poems, published in 1906 and 1907 respec tively, were written ten years after he began publishing his Polish poetry. Beginning with incorrect information and erroneous assumptions, Coates in dulges in rather lopsided speculations on the alleged Russian-Polish duality of Lesmian and on its effects on the psychological content of his poetry: "Perhaps that is why the /Polish' Lesmian chronicles the defeat of the 'Russian' LeSmian (of the Russian Symbolism at the heart of his work). (It is surely this defeat that his verses enact?and not, as Sandauer has argued, the 'defeat' of Polish Symbolism by such movements as 'Skamander' which can in fact only be said to have succeeded it)." (P. 112, emphasis added). This whole argument on Lesmian and the successors of Polish Symbolism is reinforced by Coates' scornful and blatant misstatements. He describes the "Skamander" group, including primarily Tuwim, Wierzynski, Lechon, Slonimski, and Iwaszkiewicz, as "cabaret poets" (p. 100) because they hap pened to write and personally deliver some of their works at the "Picador" cabaret. This whole discourse, including the misnomer, "cabaret poets" (which had been used by a fanatically orthodox vanguard poet and theo retician), displays the rather embarrassing manner in which Coates debates the historical and literary issues at hand. As for the latter, one should point to Coates' conclusions about the elements of dreams in Lesmian's poetry and about his attachment to folklore. The critic indicates correctly that these are two of the more important devices of Romanticism which have been handed down to Symbolism. Coates also confirms the centrality of dreams in LeSmian's poetry, which has long been emphasized by Polish critics. As Glowinski aptly states. "In Lesmian's poetry the dream constitutes a motif,</page><page sequence="16">50 The Polish Review a theme and also some kind of principle of poetic composition." (Zaswiat przedstawiony p. 217) It is quite understandable that in such rich and com plex poetic work as Lesmian's, this substantial component would acquire a variety of forms and meanings. Coates, however, denounces Polish critics for failing to perceive Lesmian's poetry "as a hallucinatory synthesis of di verse meanings and poetic movements." (P. 101, emphasis added) Coates thus narrows down the unusual frequency of the poet's employment of language and imagery of dream to "a hallucinatory synthesis" followed by its identification with nightmare, and "Freudian" nightmare at that. (P. 117) As has been proven, Lesmian was drawn to folklore, Polish, Russian, European, for a variety of reasons. One of the most compelling, if not the most compelling reason, was the poet's conviction, not unlike that of earlier Romantic and modernist poets, that the intuitive creative abilities of people endured in folklore, that folk poetry powerfully reflects people's original imagination. When Coates approaches Lesmian's artful exploitation and imi tation of folklore, he undermines Lesmian's original employment of folklor istic models. "Lesmian," proclaims Coates, "is drawn to folklore because demythologisation has robbed it of its function, because its alienation mirrors that of the writer." (Pp. 143-144) Just the opposite is true. Coates comple tely overlooks the fact that for Lesmian folklore was a force of integration; it reflected the closeness to the elementary forces of nature and imagination; it was a model of harmony between reality and imagination, between man and nature. Coates even overlooks the fact that the ballad form, so frequent in Lesmian's work, is of folkloristic and Romantic origin. How else is one to understand the contention that "Lesmian's verses have the animistic con tent of folk ballads, but their form is imposed by the fragmentariness of city life,"? (P. 142) Why this fragmentariness is generated by city life and not by the adopted ballad form is a question not even asked by the critic. This is set forth as a self-evident truth, as are many other dubious assertions. Coates is well aware of the brilliance of texture of Lesmian's poetry, and of its linguistic inventiveness, which include?apart from neologism and ar chaism?exploitation of puns and of verbal, phraseological, syntactic, and idiomatic polysemia. Coates is also cognizant of the peculiarities of Lesmian's verse forms, sound structure, rhythmic patterns, and rhyming. From this perspective and from the perspective of Coates' accomplishments in translating Lesmian's poetry, one has to admire this bold enterprise. I should add that the selection of poems which Coates offers in English trans lation shows that he is intimately familiar with the poet's work and reveals a sure grasp of Lesmian's major achievements. The poems presented, over a dozen of them, are among the most perfect and representative Lesmian has written. Coates has made a serious attempt, and in some instances a very successful one, to introduce non-Polish readers to such masterpieces of Lesmian and of modern Polish poetry, as Dziewczyna, Urszula Kocha</page><page sequence="17">Versions ofLesmian 51 nowska, Topielec, Przyspiew, W polu, Ballada bezludna, Pan Btyszczynski, Przemiany, Pszczoty, and Pita. Some of the poems are included in the criti cal discourse; others?the majority?are presented in a separate appendix. Coates is aware that his translations are uneven. In several instances it is clearly an impossible task, often due to the peculiarities of Lesmian's poetic language and his extensive exploitation of the unique features of Polish and its grammatical structure. Coates, thus, calls some of his translations "mere pallid shadows of the original," and some "mere approximations," "hints and guesses;" he also readily admits that all of his English renditions of Lesmian's poems have "their metrical feet sadly crippled." Yet, the trans lations which the reader will find in this book, with a few exceptions (To pielec, Marcin Swoboda, Pan Btyszczynski) which are starkly remote from the texture of the originals, constitute an array of English versions of Lesmian's poems ranging from congenial and excellent to others which, if not of such quality, often give a good sense of Lesmian's poetic mastery. Among the latter "approximations" is "The Saw" (Pita)', Coates makes a daring attempt to imitate the rhythmic pattern of the original, though the translation falls flat because of the sheer impossibility of rendering into Eng lish the Lesmianian colloquialisms and neologisms. But even here one comes across skilfully rendered passages, which might be exemplified by the sec ond distich, which tells of the woman-saw: And she espied a ploughboy walking in the sloping valley? I yearn for you, you are my sole dream?o you, dilly dilly (Upatrzyla parobczaka na schytku doliny: "ciebie pragn$, snie jedyny?dyny moje dyny") The same could be said of the translation of the "Uninhabited Ballad" (Ballada bezludna), certainly one of Lesmian's greatest poems. In this in stance the main regret should be that the refrain stanza, repeated three times, is so pale in the translation and a rather unfaithful shortcut through the original. Among these less felicitous translations one still finds brilliant lines and whole stanzas offering hope that Lesmian's poetry, now an epitome of ex cellence accessible exclusively to the Polish reader, does not have to remain so confined. A good example is the translation of the poem "Bees" (Pszczoty), in all not a very successful one. In the original the penultimate stanza is: Znali niegdys te cudla zlotego pomiotu A dzisiaj, zaniedbani w swych mgiet niedobrzysku Podziwiaj^ skrzydlat^ szarade^ rozblysku I chyz? lamiglowke brzecz^cego lotu!</page><page sequence="18">52 The Polish Review Making allowances for the peculiarities of vocabulary (to mention only cudla, for which one has to run to an older dictionary, and niedohrzysko) and the seemingly Baroque syntactic inversions, we might do well to appreciate this rendition: Once upon the time they knew this wondrous gold litter But now, desolate, wrapped up in ungoodly mist They marvel over the winged charade's glitter And over the speeding teaser's humming wisps. I also notice an excellent display of translating skill in "Transformations" (Przemiany), where I also found a few disturbing alterations of meaning in the closing line: What thing was 1 last night, gone forever now? (emphasis added) which in Polish runs: Czym bylem owej nocy, ktorej dzis juz nie ma? The English version strays remarkably from the original in sense, signifi cance, and tone. I am afraid that in this case the peculiarities of Coates' criti cal interpretation has had some effect on the translation. In this poem the critic found elements of "ecstatic aggression" in the speaker's voice; he also claims that in the last stanza "the speaker seeks to deny his ownership of a nocturnal, other self" and "retreats from nature, whose violence is really his own, in projected and disavowed form, and returns to civilization." (P. 143) It seems to me that Coates mispresents this poem, one of the most signifi cant for Lesmian's poetic vision of nature and of the relationship between man and nature. It is no coincidence that the poem has already become the subject of critical examination by several students of LeSmian (Slawinski, Olkusnik, Opacki). It is one of the central poems which reveal the poet's vision of nature's and the poet's own creativity. In his speculations the critic goes far beyond the limits of credible interpretation and makes claims im possible to substantiate, if one takes the pain to verify the critical commen tary on the basis of textual analyses. I am raising this additional objection to Coates' interpretations here be cause it seems to be a rare instance of the critic's method of interpretation getting in the way of the translator. This is rarely the case, so it strikes me as something particularly important. I have objected to Coates' readings of Urszula Kochanowska and Dziewczyna, but the translations of these two poems are a tour de force of Coates' skills of poetic translation. To prove this one would have to present and analyze the two poems distich by distich. I will refrain from this here, but I will invoke just two fragments of Dziew czyna which struck me as illuminating. First, the distich which recurs like a modified refrain in the ballad:</page><page sequence="19">Versions of Lesmian 53 "O, predzej skruszmy zimny glaz, nim $mierc* Dziewczyn? rdz$ powlecze!" Tak wal^c w mur dwunasty brat do jedenastu innych rzecze. is rendered into English: "O, quickly crush the cold stone lest death's rust consume the maid!" Thus?beating at the wall?one brother to the others said. I like the translation of the last two distichs, containing some of the most beautiful, reflective lines in all of Lesmian's poetry, even more. They find a fine poetic reverberation in English: Confronted with the dream's clear lie, with wonders wasted on a void The mighty hammers lay down in rows, as if well employed. Sudden silence horribly fell. All Heaven became a vacuum. Why do you mock the vacuum that has never ever mocked you? In conclusion, I have firmly maintained that Coates' critical discourse on Lesmian raises serious objections and calls, in many instances, for unequivo cal refutation. In spite of his boisterous claims, the critic does not break new ground in elucidating the work of the Polish poet. On the other hand, especially in view of the formidable challenge, Coates fares far better as a translator of Lesmian's poetry. The non-Polish reader will, therefore, benefit from this contact with Lesmian's poetry that was never possible before. Half a dozen of Lesmian's poems have previously been translated into English. But these have been more like adequate paraphrases than poetic translations. For example, one poem, Brat (Brother) has been translated twice and an thologized several times. This short, beautiful, poignant poem, one of the few explicitly commemorative, personal poems of Lesmian, depicts and ad dresses the sorrow of, and his erotic relationship with, a beloved woman who has just lost a brother. Both translations, however, are unable to convey in English the gender of the addressee. Lesmian's poem identifies this in the simplest manner, through the declension of pronouns and the conjugation of verbs in Polish. Thus, the several valuable English renditions of Lesmian's poems offered by Coates are a step forward in acquainting the non-Polish reader with one of the great masters of modern poetry and one of the grea test poets of Poland. I am quite sure that any anthology of Polish poetry in English should benefit from Coates' translations. One can only dream of an anthology of Lesmian's poetry.</page></plain_text>
