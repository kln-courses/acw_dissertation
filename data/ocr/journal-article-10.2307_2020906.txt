<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME LII, No. 7 MARcH 31, 1955 THE JOuRNAL OF PHILOSOPHY THREE STAGES OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF NATURE CULTURE is to a large extent the ability to reflect on things I past, whether this past concerns the history of the whole world or of human society or of some human activity such as art. Neither artistic inventiveness nor scientific discovery is an act of culture, but thinking about art or about science is " cultural. " The Greeks who produced the Homeric songs were not "cultural"; the Greeks had culture when they became scholiasts and started commenting on those poems. Philosophical thought in the 19th century had a historical complexion; it was an eminently cultural age. Hegel at its threshold was a philosophical historian; witness his triadic dialectical scheme, which is less a philosophy of mind than of history. The positivist Auguste Comte also evolved a tri- adic scheme of the evolution of human thought which was strictly historical. He saw the theological or "fictif," the metaphysical or abstract, and the scientific or positive age of thought. But it is remarkable that such an evolutionary or historical point of view was least adopted in one branch of philosophy, es- thetics. It is true that as a philosopher of art Hegel introduced a triadic scheme into art history. He noted three stages of Art: the Oriental or Symbolic stage; the Classical, which for him em- bodied a unity of thought and picture; and the Romantic, when thought or idea predominates.' This, however, leaves the idea of beauty itself untouched and unexplained. But could the evolu- tionary viewpoint, if introduced into this field, become fruitful? It seems to me that it could, provided we grasp this basic fact: that all our ideas about beauty have their root in the contempla- tion of Nature and in the evolution of the thought generated by that contemplation throughout the ages. The evidence for this thought is to be found in the literary descriptions of Nature. Wilhelm von Humboldt said of the beautiful in Nature: It is in general a prejudice to think that the pleasure derived from Nature requires a beautiful landscape. It may be undeniable that, beauty heightens 1 Hegel 's concept of the " Classical " and " Romantic " is obviously in- fluenced by Schiller 's original distinction between the " naive " and the "sentimental'" to which it corresponds, and must have influenced in turn the concept of the " Apollonian " and "Dionysian " elements in Greek art as uncovered by Nietzsche. 169</page><page sequence="2">170 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY immeasurably its charm, but the enjoyment is not at all dependent on it. It is the objects of Nature that without any claim to beauty attract the feeling and engage the imagination by themselves. Nature pleases, seizes, and inspires only because it is Nature. We recognize in it an infinite power, greater and more effective than any human power could be, and nevertheless not terrible. And this is because it seems as though every object of Nature radiates some- thing soft and beneficent; because the general character of Nature is goodness in greatness.2 We may talk about terrible rocks or terribly beautiful land- scapes, but Nature as such is never terrible. We quickly gain familiarity and feel at home in the wildest ravine; we feel that Nature gladly grants the man that flees to her as a hermit peace and quiet. [Quoted from a reprint, under the title "Dezember-Freuden," in the N. Y. Staats-Zeitung end Herold, Dec. 1, 1950.] It is not difficult to see that Humboldt visualizes Nature as a natural symbol, as an incarnation of goodness in greatness. He thinks that Nature pleases him as such an incarnation. But this rationalization of his enjoyment of the beautiful is obviously pri- vate or at least accidental. Others might like Nature as the in- carnation of the terrible, just as pessimists in interpreting the world use the same ethical categories as the optimists. To con- sider the Devil the ruler of the universe instead of seeing God as its master is also a sort of theism-a theism in reverse. Humboldt's definition is couched in social terms because "good- ness in greatness" is a social concept unthinkable without or out- side a society of beings. The terms are even ethical, since goodness is ethical. He loves this "goodness" and sees its embodiment in the natural forms he contemplates. But obviously there is no more connection between real goodness and this image or symbol of good- ness than between real joy or sadness and a musical piece that is supposed to express or to inspire joy or sadness. The meaning of these "forms of nature" is by no means as fixed or univocal as is that of words. If they mean anything they mean several things, like the myrtle (myrtus communis) which meant different things to different people. To the Jews it was a symbol of peace, to the Greeks it was the tree of Aphrodite and a symbol of Bacchus, to the Romans it was the symbol of sensual love and of the beauty of youth. Priests wore wreaths of myrtle. And the Arabs thought that Adam took with him a myrtle bouquet as a keepsake from Paradise. All these meanings have but one thing in common: they mean a positive value, something or other that all these nations valued highly. 2 Compare Humboldt's characterization of Nature ("goodness in great- ness") with Winckelmanni's previous definition of Greek statuary as showing "noble simplicity and silent grandeur." This age liked to equate the terms "natural," " naive, and "classical," and saw the embodiment of the three in ancient (Hellenic) art.</page><page sequence="3">CONTEMPLATION OF NATURE 171 When Kant sees in organic forms the embodiment of "pur- pose, " his view is on the same plane as that of Humboldt, though the interpretation is expressed differently, in terms of a possible activity of some hidden directive force, perhaps of a transcen- dental Driver with some occult aim. But this, too, like "goodness in greatness," reflects a social concept of nature; it is a psycho- logical interpretation of the world, not a scientific statement of facts. If a man is bent on "explaining" the totality of the world, he seems to turn to the psychological method and to do it in a psychological way. How else could he "explain" it? Such an explanation is without scientific validity and seems beyond the reach of the scientific method, but it usually has a moving human quality (just because it is psychological). When Humboldt and Kant view nature, they view it with a "Romantic attitude," the main characteristic of which consists in being hermeneutic-it is an attitude that discovers in nature a se- cret meaning which is " social. " For them the " beauty of nature " is not so much a specific property of some shapes or forms discovered in nature but the general property of nature to have a meaning- i.e., the semantic power of nature. For them the seeing of beauty in nature is not merely an enjoyment of some specific natural forms but a world view (Weltanschauung) which implies the meaningful- ness of nature and which could be called the "esthetic world view." Thus, when looking at nature, they are at the same time reading and decoding it. They may differ as to the versions of the read- ing but they do not differ in their attitude, which is interpretive, or in their method, which is semantic. They also use the same key to the code, the social key. Their attitude is obviously vastly different from that of a man looking upon nature and saying that he likes country life because of its quiet or its fresh air. His attitude is purely utilitarian as opposed to esthetic. If, however, this man then discovered a hid- den meaning in the fresh air or in the quietness, as did Humboldt, he would be on the esthetic plane. It has often been noticed that the esthetic mood is not utilitarian; therefore it has been assumed that one of its most important characteristics-perhaps the most important-is "disinterestedness." This may be true so far as it goes, although it is of minor importance; the main thing is that you look upon nature and read it as if it were a book, discovering all the meanings it unfolds. Your interest is therefore only of a different kind, it is intellectual; and so the term "disinterested- ness" may be misleading. Furthermore the "disinterestedness," which is of a special limited kind, is merely one of the subjective properties of your mood, while its main property in that instance</page><page sequence="4">172 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY consists in the discovery of the meaningfulness as an objective characteristic of nature. A few descriptions of nature show that they have the " esthetic" character delineated above and therefore of necessity employ social, psychological, and interpretational terms. This is what their beauty-and the beauty of nature they talk about-consists in. The world of nature assumes in these terms the character of a drama, of a society of acting beings. It is essentially a social per- formance.3 This is true both of poetry and of prose descriptions. John Keats says of a forest in "Endymion": Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed So plenteously all weed-hidden roots Into o 'erhanging boughs, and precious fruits. And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep Where no man went.... He says of a river (ibidem): This river does not see the naked sky Till it begins to progress silverly Around the western border of the wood Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood Seems at a distance like a crescent moon. Tennyson says ("In Memoriam," XCIV): By night we linger 'd on the lawn, For underfoot the herb was dry; And genial warmth; and o'er the sky The silvery haze of summer drawn; And calm that let the tapers burn Unwavering; not a cricket chirr'd: The brook alone far-off was heard And on the board the fluttering urn: The bats went round in fragrant skies And wheel'd or lit the filmy shapes That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes And whoolly breasts and beaded eyes; Milton, in "Lycidas": So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed And yet anon repairs his drooping head, And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore Flames in the forehead of the morning sky; a It is noteworthy that although Kant proclaims the "'disinterestedness" of the esthetic mood, he sees moral interest as permeating the perception of beauty of nature (Critique of Judgment, ?42).</page><page sequence="5">CONTEMPLATION OF NATURE 173 Milton, in "Paradise Lost" (Book IV, description of Eden): . . . and overhead up grew Insuperable height of loftiest shade, Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm, A sylvan scene, and as the ranks ascend Shade above shade, a woody theatre Of stateliest view .... (The expressions showing the dramatic, vitalistic, social view of nature, the interpretative terms in the above descriptions, are underscored. They hold, as it were, the whole fabric of the poem. It is the canvas on which the poem seems to be spread.) If Shakespeare says that there is "a tide" in the life of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune, he applies both a social view to nature and a naturalistic and fatalistic view to human affairs. If Dante speaks of the river Po: " dove il Po diseende co' seguaci sui " (where the Po descends with his fol- lowers), he takes a social view of this river and its confluents. As for prose, Plato gives in the Phaedrus a description of nature which exhibits all the above-mentioned marks of the "esthetic," although it contains curious utilitarian incrustations: Here is this lofty and spreading plane-tree, and the agnus castus high and clustering, in the fullest bloom and the greatest fragrance; and the stream which flows beneath the plane-tree is deliciously cold to the feet. Judging from the ornaments and images, this must be a spot sacred to Achelous and the Nymphs. How delightful is the breeze:-so very sweet; and there is a sound in the air shrill and summerlike which makes answer to the chorus of the cicadae. But the greatest charm of all is the grass, like a pillow gently sloping to the head. [Phaedrus, 230, Jowett's translation.] In this description the very incongruity of the esthetic and util- itarian passages shows that we are dealing with two different world views, two planes of thought at variance with each other. The utterances of these poets and writers may be taken as a documentation of the Romantic ("esthetic") view of nature. What these poets say expresses implicitly what and how other people feel, and this is also abstractly expressed by such generali- zations as "goodness in greatness," "purpose," "a spot sacred to Achelous and the Nymphs," or whatever other social, psychological terms may be used to characterize nature. But since I have used the quotation from Plato I must here anticipate the mythological root of the Romantic (esthetic) (i.e., the social and psychological) view of nature. Plato reveals its origin, in which, exhibiting equally psychological and social traits, it was still more than that, namely, psychological and social in a religious sense. In literature these psychological and social characteristics are not directly as-</page><page sequence="6">174 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY serted in a religious sense, they are simply implied in the "style.'' In other words, these characteristics of nature are reduced and attenuated to a mere implication. We should now ask: Where is this hermeneutic view of nature in its undiluted form, its un- shriveled fullness? Where is it found unadulterated, not withered to its "Romantic" shadowy stage? Where are its prototypes? Where is the pre-Romantic or proto-Romantic view of nature? Or is it perhaps unique, something that has emerged miraculously from the human mind, so that "beauty" had to enrich the world like some irreducible fact, a mysterious tertiary quality? Such a view would be unhistorical, unpsychological, non-evolu- tionary, and contrary to all scientific experience of the mind of man. And the quotation from the Phaedrus gives us a hint as to how our investigation should proceed. We should not disregard the fact of the stratification of the human mind. The knowledge of this stratification seems to me the main result of the revolution, or seeming revolution, introduced into psychology by Sigmund Freud. What did this revolution consist in? Essentially in the adoption of the evolutionary point of view in the study of the phenomena of affectivity. Just as in Haeckel's biology ontogene- sis is explained by phylogenesis, in Freud's psychology the onto- genetic picture of affectivity is explained by the phyletic evolution of the human psyche, which thus appears stratified. The phe- nomena of dream and neurosis served him as the gateway to the realm of psychic pre-history. Later on, Freud himself tried to bolster up his ontogenetic investigations by an analysis in the field of social psychology of the past (Totem and Tabu). In order to find the origin of the present esthetic (Romantic) view of nature, i.e., of beauty, we have to turn back to those liter- ary documents that have transmitted a more ancient view of na- ture. Such documents are, for instance, the Homeric poems which illustrate the mythological view of nature, showing human beings and the superhuman things of nature deified and yet living in a social state of sheer promiscuity with each other. Nature is peo- pled with various divinities that differ among themselves and from humans only by the amount of power they wield. Superimposed on the families of humans is Nature as a family of deities with Zeus, the father of gods and men, at its head. The dark woods are the abode of Centaurs; Leukothea, the "white wave" of the sea, is a marine goddess. There is also a stream, Oceanos, another water god, and Proteus, also an old god of the sea, who sleeps among the seals (Odyssey, Book IV). He may become a terrifying lion, then a leopard, then a bluish dragon, a wrathful wild boar, then flowing water, and finally a tree reaching into the clouds.</page><page sequence="7">CONTEMPLATION OF NATURE 175 *But if held fast by a hero unafraid he may be forced into deliver- ing an oracle. Thus Nature forms a society of beings in perfect communion with the society of men and operating on a similar plan-a psychological one. Odysseus is engaged in long conver- sations with the goddess Athene, daughter of Zeus. His "girls," the Nymphs and Naiads, are on the islands and in the waters. Nor is the world of the deceased excluded from this society of beings. The elect such as Odysseus may descend to Erebus, the realm of Hades, and talk to the souls of the dead. He thus per- formed a feat later on repeated by Dante, under different auspices. There are some traces of this mythological view of nature in the Old Testament. The serpent talks in Paradise, God appears to Moses in the form of a burning bush on a "sacred spot" (Exodus, Chapter 3), and Moses' staff is transformed into a snake and re- transformed into a staff as a proof of his divine mission. God appears as "a cloud" covering the tent of congregation and as "fire" on the tabernacle by night (Exodus, Chapter 40). If gods are eliminated here, there are still angels with flaming swords, in an intermediary condition between men and God. Only if we were to add the divine personalities acting in nature in the mythological period as the implied subjects of the poetic descriptions of later epochs, would the original significance be re- stored to these passages; they would then become pulsating with life and meaning. A bloodstream would pour into the flaccid and shadowy implications which are deprived of their proper subjects. The godless dawn in "Lycidas" which has a flaming forehead but no visage could then become the red-fingered Eos (erigeneita rhodo- daktylos Eos) in a world of nature where the God Helios could still possess his beautiful herd of cattle on the island of Trinakia. This mythological view of nature is by no means very primi- tive; rather is it an early instance of an idealistic interpretation of the world, a cosmological form of idealism based on a mentalis- tic (psychological) world concept. Theism of any kind-whether poly-, heno-, or monotheism-is a projection of the mind-body re- lation into the cosmos, namely, an extension of this relation on a cosmic scale so that the material things correspond to the body and God or the Gods to the mind. Even in the polytheistic stage, the objects of nature are identified as minds and with minds. But it could be argued whether polytheistic idealism is an early stage of theism or of pantheism (or of both), since polytheistic nature is a pantheon of gods who may then be synthetized into one Deity, encompassing mind and bodies, or "extension" and "thought." The polytheistic deities do not seem to be outside the world, like the theistic God, but rather inside it. In theism, God, becoming</page><page sequence="8">176 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY purely immaterial, cannot be anywhere in the spatial world and yet must be everywhere. God as Mind is, therefore, placed here outside the Body, i.e., the World. This second stage of cosmological idealism, constituting the theological view of nature, is best exhibited in the Hebrew Psalms. God here dwells outside the world and the things of nature, but the world is his instrument, just as the body is the instrument of the mind. Nature is therefore still divine on this view, but not directly; it is divine as the work of God, as the object of his operations. Psalm 18 says of the Lord: He bowed the heavens also, and came: and darkness was upon his feet. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. . . . The Lord also thundered in the heavens, . . . and he shot out lightnings .... The similarity of this view to the mythological one is evident. It is also said (Exodus, 14): And it came to pass, that . . . the Lord looked into the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud... These are the transitions from the mythological to the theologi- cal view of nature, which is fully stated in the following passages: Psalm 19: "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge." Psalm 24: "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof . . . the world and they that dwell therein." Psalm 74: "The day is thine, the night is also thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter." Psalm 89: "Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them." Psalm 104: "0 Lord, . . . Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind. " Psalm 114: " The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. What ailed thee, 0 thou sea, that thou fleddest: thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord. . .. We see in these sentences the second stage of cosmological idealism: theological idealism in the contemplation of nature. Nature is envisaged as the object of a mental power, but it is no longer its subject, as was the case on the mythological stage.</page><page sequence="9">CONTEMPLATION OF NATURE 177 Mind has receded behind the scene, has left individual objects and manages them from a distance. But the objects of nature are still in social interaction with this mental power and among themselves; therefore they retain "meaning" as managed, manoeuvred, and operated by the Supreme Power. They can and do respond to it psychologically, not mechanically. They are "afraid," they "obey." Thus in these two stages, the mythological as well as the theological, the objects of nature are viewed in a psychologi- cal, social way. Only the theoretical framework, the systemic over-all structure of the utterances of nature, is different. The "beauty" of this world of nature consists only in the fact of the "meaning" it possesses as social and psychological, as responsive to orders and therefore apt to feel fear or to obey. Indeed what other kind of " meaning " in the sense of " sense " or " importance 7 is thinkable? Were it dead or mechanical, then it would be de- prived of "meaning" and possess as a consequence no "beauty." The beauty lies in the meaning, and the meaning lies first in the overtly asserted divine quality, then in the fact of divine manage- ment and the response to it, and lastly, in the purely Romantic (esthetic) stage, in the merely implied (albeit not overtly asserted) divine status. Like art, the mythological and theological systems of nature are more an invention than a discovery; they are evolved not only as a result of some natural light but also as a result of some need -otherwise they would not be evolved. They are not found merely as the result of an investigation, like the scientific system of nature. It seems obvious that the system of nature evolved in the mytho- logical stage of cosmological idealism corresponds more readily to the affective needs of a human being than do the subsequent stages. It constitutes a fuller response to the need for social and psycho- logical communion with nature which is naturally inherent in man as a social and psychological being. At the mythological stage the psychologization of nature is direct and more concrete, since here every single object of nature is endowed in its own right with in- dependent psychological and social power and character-it has a meaning of its own. The world has therefore more life in this phase, whereas the system already becomes much more abstract in the theological system of nature: here the objects live rather as it were by borrowed light-as planets,-they live owing to the life of Deity that suffuses them with it and is the only source of their life. Therefore a hush of grayness already settles on this world- despite the Power behind it which, eternally invisible, becomes visible in it-as against the colorful living society of independent natural divinities or minds (psyches) of mythology or polytheism.</page><page sequence="10">178 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY This grayness thickens at the scientific stage when the psyches are driven out of a nature bereft of divinity, life, and consequently of meaning. It is interesting to note that the poet Franz Grillparzer entertained similar ideas.4 Here it should be pointed out that the view of nature at the mythological stage conveys the feeling called in traditional esthe- tics "beauty." This is the system of nature "beautiful" par ex- cellence, while the world view expressed at the theological level evokes a mood called "sublime." The "sublime" is the creation of the theological level. This is shown in the Psalms quoted above. They convey a view of nature which is "sublime," while the Homeric view of nature is "beautiful." The third and last stage of the contemplation of nature, the Romantic (esthetic), shows a mixture of the two preceding levels. Its direct opposite is the sci- entific view which drives out from nature the elements of cosmo- logical idealism-of mentalism-and despoils it of its psychological and social character, depriving it thereby also of "meaning" and consequently of "esthetic" qualities. Literary documents show us the transition from the mytholog- ical to the theological view, and also from the latter to the purely esthetic one. The second of these transitions may be seen in St. Luke's Gospel, 23: 44, where the death of Jesus is accompanied by natural events that seem to sympathize with His death and stress the terrible importance of the events: And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the Temple was rent in the midst. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into they hands I commend my spirit; and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. The veil of the Temple rent in its midst is the symbol of the world torn in half by Jesus' death. It also recalls the action of mourners who tear their clothes in the act of mourning. The veil of the Temple becomes alive and responsive. Thus this and the other actions of nature resemble human action-they are reactions. The sun darkens as would the human heart or spirit at this junc- ture. And it should darken if it has a human heart and a living conscience. But the remarkable thing in this passage is the fact that direct Divine actioni is not asserted. It is only implied that 4He said in his remarks "On Fate" in Aesthetische Studien: "The pagan world view is the natural view (Naturansicht). Therefore I prefer it for poetry. The Christian one rests on suppositions. It is therefore in its essence eontingent and limited. Who knows whether it will be still valid in 300 years? The pagan one will be valid as long as the world exists and men are men." (My own translation.)</page><page sequence="11">CONTEMPLATION OF NATURE 179 nature co6perates, obviously as a result of its Divine dedication to the idea of justice or love or both, in this tragedy of Jesus' death. This example of the co6peration of nature in the form of com- passion leads directly to similar instances, abounding in world literature, where the death of a hero is accompanied by strange natural events that exhibit compassion or co-operation on the side of Nature. Such poetic works as Macbeth or King Lear exhibit a similar view of nature. Nature 's reaction to the murder of Banquo is described thus: The night has been unruly: where we lay, Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say, Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death, And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confus'd events New hatch'd to the woful time. The obscure bird Clamour'd the live-long night: some say the earth Was feverish and did shake. (Macbeth, Act II, Sc. 3.) King Lear's misfortune is accompanied by nature's acts: KENT: . . Since I was a man, Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder, Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry The affliction nor the fear. LEAR: Let the great gods, That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads, Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch, That hast within thee undivulged crimes, Unwhipped of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand." (King Lear, Act III, Sc. 2.) While the view of nature expressed in these quotations reflects the mythological or theological level of thought, the author uses these expressions as an esthetic device to heighten the dramatic effect. But he can do so because he can count on the response of his audience: he knows that they would like and appreciate this reaction of nature, would be happy and morally satisfied if such co6peration of nature should take place at these moments. Nature here responds to the requirements of justice, metes out punish- ment, etc. It is "meaningful," social, and psychological. Lear's words assert overtly this point of view. How enthralling and "beautiful" this mythological point of view is to the human mind can be gauged from the fact that, when in the Renaissance period a "revival" of ancient beauty was con- sciously attempted, the Graeco-Roman Pantheon, although watered down to the shadowy status of figures of speech, reappeared at once in the descriptions of nature all over Europe. In our time the</page><page sequence="12">180 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY theological view has been revived in a similar vein: compare for instance Rainer Maria Rilke or Paul Claudel or many others. This revival is now also "esthetic " rather than doctrinally genuine. We come now to the third view of nature, the Romantic (es- thetic), already illustrated at the beginning of this study in the descriptions of nature taken from literature. The close relation- ship between this view and the two others, the mythological and theological, is striking. All three are mentalistic-specimens of a sort of cosmological idealism. All three show the psychological social attitude, the difference being that on the esthetic level the ground of belief, which is religious on the theological and mytho- logical level, is neither mentioned nor asserted as it was on the other two. This is somewhat similar to a "superstition" which is currently believed without any awareness or assertion of its reason. And the reason lies in the mental attitude of the past. Nature, when seen in this, the third attitude, is "beautiful." The beauty lies in the meaningfulness, which is, however, conveyed by an at- titude that may of course use objective elements existing in nature -such as shapes or sizes or even colors-as a sort of building material in its mentalistic framework. All three attitudes are basically different from the scientific attitude, which is not, like them, an interpretation (of a supposed humanly important meaning), but at its best an analysis of a col- lection of neutral facts. The two earlier views have this in com- mon: they are a psychological social interpretation of the world; while the third and last view, the Romantic (esthetic), does not assert directly the divinity of the world-which is what beauty seems to consist in-because it dispenses with the expression of its doctrinal structure-Deity or gods,-but it still expresses it im- plicitly in a sort of diffused and uncodified, rhapsodic way that adumbrates at least subterraneously what the two earlier views asserted overtly. This result of our investigation may seem paradoxical. So is another indirect conclusion, that the Romantic (esthetic) world view is, as were the two previous ones, in a sense a moral view of the world, in that it subjects the objects of nature, as beings re- sponding to social psychological laws-implicitly to moral laws- and makes out of them subjects, of morality. Of course this has nothing to do with Kant's statement that the beautiful is a symbol of the morally good. However, our "things of beauty"-the ob- jects of nature that rebel at the injustice of Lear's treatment or of Banquo's murder-are "moral" things, as is the veil of the Temple rent at the moment of Jesus' crucifixion or the sun that darkens at that moment. The world of beauty turns, out to be a</page><page sequence="13">GOOD REASONS AND REASONABLE ACTS 181 "moral world," and its beauty consists in its social responsiveness, in its being "moral." It may be tainted by cruelty-it is then "sinful," a thing subject to error and evil-but it is not morally and socially neutral. Surprising though this result may be, it is certainly not sur- prising to find that the "beautiful" world is a world ruled by social and moral laws, because this is the kind of world human beings desire. Only a divine world-that is, a living world-is beautiful, and its beauty consists precisely in its divineness. Of course this attitude could be dismissed lightly as "'animistic,'' "anthropomorphic," or "vitalistic," and therefore "primitive," but basically such "animism," "anthropomorphism," and "vital- ism" mean only a lower degree of divineness conferred upon things.5 The three views presented all have this in common: they are specimens of cosmological idealism. They must be if they are to give a humanly plausible, that is, a psychological, explanation of the world. MAX RIESER NEW YORK CITY 5 It is not surprising if a human mind tries to give to a divine mind a human outline. But this process may be reversed instantly by a change of direction, and anthropomorphism turns into the theomorphism of which it is a correlate. Human minds are then said to be likenesses of divine minds or even a part of them. The mystery of a "limited" mind is then "explained" by the still greater mystery of an all-embracing supermind. The theogonic origin of human minds is then asserted, just as the world was previously in- terpreted by the existence of divine minds animating it.</page></plain_text>
