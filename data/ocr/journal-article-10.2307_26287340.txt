<plain_text><page sequence="1">"gravity rushes through him": volk and fetish in pynchon's rilke Doug Haynes Modern society, which already in its infancy had pulled Pluto by the hair of his head from the bowels of the earth, greets gold as its Holy Grail, as the glittering incarnation of its innermost principle of life. —Karl Marx, Capital Vol. I On the face of it, Austrian Bohemian poet Rainer Maria Rilke, a transitional figure between German neo-Romanticism and European modernism in the early twentieth century, is an unlikely presence in Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, perhaps the quintessential postmodern American novel. The snobbish Rilke didn't even like America, the country of "empty, indifferent things, sham things, dum mies of life," he thought (Heidegger 218). Notoriously recherche and idiosyncratic, the work of the poet's middle and later period moves toward a reconciliation with death and inner nature, seemingly at odds with Pynchon's world-historical scope and mercurial style. Indeed, much critical work on Gravity's Rainbow stresses the novel's profound reluctance to offer unmitigated notions of transcendence, release, or redemption. Rather, complicity, recuperation, and circularity dominate its tropes and figures; force confronts "Counterfo.rce" (616) and pairs entwine in the collusive "ultraparadoxicality" (48) described by the Mfs MFS Modern Fiction Studies,Volume 58, number 2, Summer 2012.

"gravity rushes through him": VOLK AND FETISH IN PYNCHON'S RILKE Doug Haynes</page><page sequence="2">Haynes 309 novel's Pavlovian behavioral scientist Ned Pointsman, conjuring the dialectical duo of master and slave. Even the "other side"—death itself—which makes frequent traffic into Pynchon's text, is, as one deceased character laments, "as bureaucratized hopelessly on that side as ever on this" (238). And far from exploring inner life, as Rilke does in considerable detail, Gravity's Rainbow is a sprawling mock epic dealing with the Second World War, with the German V2 rocket program, and with a coda involving Nixon in LA in 1973. Yet Rilke's late works, and the best-known in English—the ethereal Duino Elegies and Sonnets to Orpheus, both published in 1922—recur throughout the novel, sometimes directly cited, and often, especially in the case of the Tenth Elegy, providing melancholy ambience for whole episodes of Pynchon's picaresque labyrinth. Two characters are even named after episodes in the Elegies—Enzian is the gentian from the Ninth, while Katje Borgesius combines a tricky Argentinean writer with the Dutch for "catkin," an image from the striking last stanza of the Tenth. Of course Rilke isn't the only cultural producer to whom Pynchon alludes in his novel; David Cowart counts about fifty of them, ranging from Hobbes to Weber, from Fritz Lang to Marshall McLuhan. But only the poets Rilke and Emily Dickinson are cited directly, Rilke far more extensively. Reviewing Gravity's Rainbow for the New York Times Book Review in 1973, Richard Locke suggested that the German poet was by far the most important cultural figure in the novel, noticing that the latter's opening and closing sequences correspond to the open ing and closing lines of the Elegies: the visceral First Elegy—"Who if I cried, would hear me among the angelic / orders?"—is echoed in the screaming of the V2 Rocket-bomb that comes across London's sky in the famous first sentence of Gravity's Rainbow, while the line describing an "emotion that almost startles / when happiness falls" (Rilke, Duino 99), providing the quiet end to the tenth and last Elegy, is reprised, even parodied, by the descending nuclear missile at the finale of Pynchon's narrative. What for Rilke is a surprising, even gently bathetic appreciation of mortality in the drooping of a catkin on a bare hazel becomes in Pynchon the mass terrorization of the atomic age, a bombastic yet ever-deferred threat of an ending—in Rilkean terms, the cheapest, because least individual form of both life and death. Writing of the First World War, for example, the poet initially welcomed conflict—"Godhead at last!" he wrote jingoistically in his 1914 Five Hymns (qtd. in Butler 252), but approbation turned quickly to condemnation of this "monstrous universality" (Schwarz 27). As Maurice Blanchot points out, nostalgia for a preindustrial, discrete and aristocratic death somehow immanent to an authentic life haunts Rilke's work (123). The apocalyptic freeze-frame that closes Gravity's Rainbow, which is presented as a film or mass spectacle,</page><page sequence="3">310 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" suggests, however, that the modern way of death cannot be like the inward one Rilke describes in The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, where "one knew (or perhaps one guessed it) that one had one's death within one, as a fruit its kernel" (18), an image recurring in the Elegies. Pynchon's death is absurd, violent, and sudden. One clear confluence between the writers, though, is a concern with transformation. "Come and go with metamorphosis" (Sonnets 113), declares the final Sonnet to Orpheus from which Pynchon directly cites. He also prefaces the first part of his novel with Nazi scientist Werner Von Braun's ambiguous remark that "Nature does not know extinction. All it knows is transformation" (1). Rilke's late poetics all develop this notion of changeability as well, seeking to dissolve the tangible, temporal world into what he called world inner space [Weltinnenraum], interpreted by commentators variously as inner life, aesthetic space, unreserved Being, or as figurai language itself—a becoming-invisible indissociable in his work from ideas of death. In a letter to Witold van Hulewicz, his translator, Rilke wrote that "We are the Bees of the Invisible. . . . Our task is to impregnate the provisional and perishable earth so profoundly in our mind, with so much patience and passion, that its essence can be reborn in us invis ible" (Blanchot 140). In the Ninth Elegy, this reaches its apostrophic apogee: "Earth: is it not just this that you want: to arise / invisibly in us? Is not your dream / to be one day invisible? Earth! Invisible! / What is your urgent command, if not transformation?" (Rilke, Duino 87). For Blanchot and other critics, both inner space and the poet's desire for alteration express a reconciliation with, even a demand for death, both of the self and of the world; and perhaps death can be seen here really as a figure for a less instrumental form of being. Suffice to say, there is a strange erotics of death in Rilke's poetry that adds credence to Locke's suggestion in his review of Gravity's Rainbow that the novel might be read as a "serio-comic variation on Rilke's Duino Elegies and their German Romantic echoes in Nazi cul ture." One such leitmotif passing from Romanticism through Rilke into National Socialism and into Pynchon's novel might be the notion of Liebestod, or "love-death," a theme on which Rilke certainly provides a variation. Wagnerian in tone, Liebestod describes the consummation of love through or after death, linking death with desire: "Only from the side of death, I believe, is it possible to do justice to love," Rilke wrote in his Briefe an eine Frau (qtd. in Leishman 151). Rather than simply see Rilke as a proto-Nazi, however, I suggest that in Gravity's Rainbow Pynchon reads the Elegies and Sonnets firstly to explore the culture of irrationalism in the Weimar period and how it prepares an imaginary history for the Third Reich. Sec ondly, he reads them for a poetics that celebrates such irrationality</page><page sequence="4">Haynes 311 as critique. And thirdly, he reads to demonstrate that this variety of neo-Romanticism unconsciously reveals its basis in the fetish of the commodity. Unlike other schémas suggested for the structure of the book—Puritanism, Tarot, Kabala, and so on—Rilke's poetry and, to an extent, the life of the poet himself, allows Pynchon a purchase on a crucial period of German history. Although Rilke himself propounded a resolutely subjectivist view of art—art is "outside all time," he wrote (Schwarz 26)—his oeuvre, as Egon Schwarz has demonstrated, tracks important tendencies in early twentieth century political thought. Ulrich Fülleborn even suggests that "there is hardly an intellectual problem of the beginning twentieth century which does not reappear as a theme in Rilke's work and find there a solution" (qtd. in Schwarz 52). So despite the pose he struck of the isolated poète maudit, we should see in Rilke something of his contemporary Geist, obviously useful for Pynchon in his attention to the German twentieth century. An ethnic German born to a déclassé bourgeois family in Prague in 1875 and educated in Munich, Rilke was not only witness to the complex transition from Prussian imperium to Weimar Republic and the rise of the far right, but he also travelled widely in Europe and with important cultural contacts. With his mistress Lou Andreas-Salomé, Freud's pupil, he visited Spain, Italy, and Russia, admiring what he thought of as the premodern quality of these cultures; later in Paris he befriended Cezanne and worked as a secretary to Rodin, about whom he wrote several lengthy essays. In Berlin and then Munich during the war he knew Kurt Eisner, leader of the brief 1918 socialist revolution. Malte Brigge was written in Paris, where by 1910 he had developed much of his distaste for cities and fondness for country houses and their occupants. In Duino near Trieste, he stayed with Princess Marie von Thum und Taxis—a highly recognizable name for Pynchon readers—and spent his last years in Switzerland, where the Elegies and Sonnets were completed.1 His claim not to have worldly interests is hence contradicted by the stories, poems, and letters he wrote commenting on matters such as the Slav rising in Bohemia, the First World War, the German revolution, and Mussolini's victory in Italy. The instability of his politics, however, is demonstrated by the disparity between his cautious initial approval for Eisner but later enthusiasm in 1922 for Mussolini. In a positive metaphor echoing the Orphic transformation of the Sonnets and the forge of Vulcan from the Tenth Elegy, the Italian leader became for the poet a "smith forging a consciousness that blazes up anew at the flames of an ancient fire" (qtd. in Schwarz 3). Such "prefascist tendencies" in Rilke are explained by Herbert Lehnert as "anticapitalism from the right" (108), a move ment fuelled by nostalgia for antiquity, like Mussolini's fetishization of ancient Rome, which included writers like Alfred Schüler, who Rilke was reading at the time (as was Adolf Hitler).</page><page sequence="5">312 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" Pynchon's reading attempts to disentangle the cultural logic of Rilke's two later poem sequences largely through the two major characters in Gravity's Rainbow, both of whom are Rilke readers of a sort.2 The German Weissmann, or Blicero, and the American Tyrone Slothrop are both figured in relation to the poet, despite their very different significances in the text. Blicero, the architect of the rocket program and chief representative of Nazi ideology has, the narrator tells us, long been an adherent of the Elegies; now, like other senior Nazis, he's a "royal moth" drawn to the transforming Flame of the Sonnets, citing Rilke's injunction to "Want the change. ... 0 be inspired by the Flame" (98), an image used also for the "revolution" of fascism, as suggested above. Slothrop, Blicero's opposite, is a more sympathetic, schlemiel-like character around whose perspec tive much of the book is narrated. He condenses in his name both "sloth" and "entropy" (actually an anagram of "sloth or entropy"), key words in Pynchon's idiom. Toward the end of the narrative, he returns to nature, transformed mysteriously into a crossroads in a passage that, through indirect free style, links his interior life with a reading of Rilke's Orpheus, the embodiment of nature as song.3 As Slothrop disappears, blowing a blues harp found in a stream, evok ing the "harpmen and dulcimer players in all the rivers" (622), we read his thoughts and then part of the final sonnet: "Like that Rilke prophesied, / And though Earthliness forget you, / To the stilled Earth say: I flow, / To the rapid water speak: I am" (622; emphasis added). Arguably, these are the poles of Rilkean interpretation. Blicero finds in the Elegies and Sonnets a Bildung narrative for himself and then the Reich: a "commission" {Auftrag), in the phrase of the po ems, actually to transform and dominate a fallen world. This reading puts considerable strain on Rilke's thought. Even Theodor Adorno's animus towards the poet is drawn mostly from his perception of Rilke's language as subservient, preparatory to Nazi bureaucracy (68). Blicero's Rilke goes further to tease out strongly conservative tendencies in the poetry that did indeed find approval in Germany after 1933. In his "literalist" reading, he sees the language of the poetry as, in Paul de Man's words, "the unmediated expression of an unhappy consciousness that it does not cause" (26), an unhappiness it seeks to heal through the embrace of a powerful new ideology. Slothrop, meanwhile, embodies more the existential Rilke of the poet's post-1950s German and American reception—a bricoleur attempting authentic existence against the backdrop of the technological and nuclear age. This Rilke is appreciably shaped by Heidegger's explicitly philosophical reading of the poetry as the expression of a profound openness to nature. Both the tension and similarities between these interpretations seem worth exploring, suggesting as they do some</page><page sequence="6">Ha/nes 313 thing more nuanced than the Manichean oppositions often read into Pynchon's magnum opus. O be inspired by the Flame Blicero's reading of Rilke takes us into the territory German historian Jeffery Herf has famously called "reactionary modernism," an accommodation achieved in the German interwar years between on the one hand archaic, volkisch ideas articulating national identity and, on the other, the apparatus of modernity: machines, organiza tion, and bureaucracy. That Rilke was at least nostalgic is unques tionable, and his early dislike of Germanism in fact stemmed really from a dislike of the bureaucratic state. Alongside his notorious and theodical remarks spiritualizing poverty as "a great shining forth from within" (qtd. in Schwarz 17), his comments on Mussolini exemplify a strand of Romantic thought valorizing an aristocratically ordered ancien régime against his own time. Rilke was in fact vehemently antimodern in his attitudes, particularly disliking mechanization and industrialization as well as being wary of any "new" politics. Schwarz shows how, from his earliest stories to the mature poetry, the writer sets the precapitalist, feudal world of princes, peasants, and na ture against commerce, industry, plebeianization, and radical social change. Although supportive of Eisner in Munich, for example, Rilke's revolutionary spirit was really, it seems, a form of conservatism: "I understand revolution to mean the overcoming of abuses for the sake of the most profound tradition" (qtd. in Schwarz 38), he wrote in a 1918 letter to aristocratic correspondent Baroness von Ledebur. One need only glance for now at the Tenth Elegy—which nar rates a journey from the everyday world of vulgar financial exchange and disenchanted religion, the Trostmarkt, or market of compensa tions, into the more real "Land of Pain" (Rilke, Duino 95)—to see this. Beyond the fairground hoardings and beery atmosphere of the corrupt city, we travel to an infinitely more austere landscape, one once wisely ruled by the "Lords of the House of Lament" (Rilke, Duino 95). The demure girl who leads the protagonist touches him emotionally because her manner and physique suggest nobility; odd "griefstones"—natural riches once mined from the volcano by the princes in this death-country, polished objects thrown spontaneously from the ground—contrast with the urban lewdness of paper money, which, we are told, has its genitals on show. As with the Seventh El egy, the quotidian world is industrial and barren, religiosity and order has been replaced by consumerism and avarice; we must therefore, the poetic voice tells us, build "within" (73), summoning that notion</page><page sequence="7">314 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" of inner space. So, from his early attraction to Slavic rural culture to this late work, Rilke references a romanticized version of earlier social formations to critique modernity. How, then, can Blicero incorporate such a poetic vision into his own technocratic worldview? One answer is that Pynchon stages through Blicero the congruence of the Nazi ideologue, in all his folk ish irrationality, with the cooler figure of the modern engineer. He catches, as he does so, an aspect of fascist thinking we might liken to the Nietzschean, synthetic view of German history that seeks the unity of the German inner spirit with daily life. Such a unity demands the outward sham of bourgeois universalism—emblematized by the professional exterior of a figure like an engineer—be refigured by the embrace of a more "profound" inner identity like the love of homeland, a synthesis that Nietzsche, in his long essay on the uses and disadvantages of history, likens to a work of art (Nietzsche 7). Rilke supplies the conceptual material, in particular his ideas about an appropriate death and the cosmology attached to it, to transform the rocket program, for Blicero, into more than a technical project, lending it the tragic character of destiny. An acceptance of destiny is, for Rilke, exactly what modernity has passed over in its attempt at enlightened self-grounding: "oh, why / have to be human, and, shunning Destiny, / long for Destiny" (Duino 83), asks the Ninth El egy, hinting at the need to transcend, or descend from the rational, humanist consciousness engendering such emotions. "[L]ong before he embraced the Reich's flame, since Südwest", the narrator of Gravity's Rainbow notes, Blicero has sought the fate prepared for him with Rilke as a guide (98). This Odyssey begins with the colonial genocide of the Herero people in German Southwest Af rica in 1922, an action following from the Bismarckian expansionism of previous decades, the so-called Deutsche Kolonisation program, according to which the development of national consciousness de manded an aggressive overseas policy. Blicero, then Lt. Weissmann, reads the newly published Elegies during his sojourn in the territory, interpreting his experience in the South African desert in terms of that of the youth of the Tenth Elegy in the land of death, recalling the "abrading fires of the Kalahari" (99) and the "wildly alien" (98) constellations there, just as Rilke's youth discovers new skies with new significances.4 And, like the traveler of the Ninth Elegy, it is in this exotic country that he plucks the ineffable flower, the gentian, his native boy-lover Enzian. Particularly moving for him as a Rilke reader is the line ending the narrative section of the Tenth Elegy, quoted by Pynchon in both English and German and drawing us close to Blicero's sensibilities: "And not once does his step ring from this soundless Destiny" (98). Caught in this line is the absolute quality of</page><page sequence="8">Haynes 315 destiny, the necessity of whatever happens, rehearsed elsewhere in the novel when Rilke's "Once, only once" is cited as the slogan of the powerful System (413). In Heidegger's gloss on Rilke, destiny is, as perhaps also with Nietzsche's eternal return, the willful affirmation of that which is unwilled, or given. In Gravity's Rainbow, we see Blicero attempt this unreflective or "soundless" embrace of his fate through the knowing cultivation of evil: his "thirst for guilt" is as "insatiable as the desert's for water" (323). For him, this trajectory continues to the next war, the building of the Rocket, and the death he imagines for himself in "the Oven" (99), the latter a reference that calls up both his self-appointed role as Hansel and Gretel's witch from the Grimm's folk tale as well as another of the Reich's technical projects with which he has associations. His personal destiny may precede the formation of the Reich itself but, as Pynchon's V. suggests, events in the colony prepare the nation for its future. At the heart of African domination is some thing both quasi-religious and yet routinized. As Marjorie Kauffman notices, the African episode in V. depicts a shift of "manners and morals" (197) in the colony to what Pynchon calls "a logic . . . that substituted capability for character, deliberate scheme for political epiphany," while even the worst atrocities, for Weismann, neverthe less melt finally and mystically into a "great cosmic fluttering in the blank, bright sky, [which] had only to do with the destroyer and the destroyed, and the act which united them, and it had never been that way before" (Pynchon, V. 264). All this is reactionary modernism as Herf describes it: the rela tion in German cultural thought between exactly the kind of semi mythologized past Rilke invokes—the location of a specifically German nationalist Kultur— as it grapples with the distrusted Zivilisation of Western Enlightenment. Such distrust leaks out, we might note, in the work of thinkers on all sides, left and right, from Weber to Hei degger; for us, however, Herf ascribes this cocktail of patriotic and illiberal sentiment to Germany's accelerated industrial history and lack of a real bourgeois revolution. Indeed, we might say it is exactly the elision of a bourgeois revolutionary consciousness, with all its liberalizing tendencies, that reactionary modernism—or for us, the destinarianism of Rilke—wishes to achieve. The Weimar period, Herf argues, thus attempts a compromise between Germanic Kultur and its apparent enemy, Technik, by investing aspects of the latter with properties of the former. This began originally with the nineteenth century political Romantics as they imagined a Kulturnation emerging from death and transfiguration, it continued in the writings of post World War I thinkers like Schmitt and Spengler, and was ultimately adopted by the Nazi Party.</page><page sequence="9">316 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" The cooptation of engineers for this process, as Karl-Heinz Lud wig argues, was pivotal, creating a bridge between the anticapitalist, unionized engineer class and the state. Importantly, it also allowed technology to be recast not as the manifestation of enlightened reason or a means of class domination but as the outward sign of deeper, more fatal forces belonging to the Romantic and folk imagination. Commenting on Spengler, whose Decline of the West (1922) was an exemplary work for this kind of ideological suturing, Herf tells us that, "Behind the smooth, lean surfaces of modern technical artifacts, Spengler saw at work the dark, elemental, demonic forces that had been the focus of so much previous (anti-industrial) romanticism" (50). One might turn again to Rilke when he renders the outer world, including its artificial objects, an uncanny version of its more absolute inner double: "tower, mountain, bridge," he writes, "in every one of them a whole inner world [is] exhibited, as though an angel, in whom space was included, were blind and looking into himself" (qtd. in Jephcott, 233). Somewhat like Pynchon's paranoia, the inner space Rilke describes here suggests a revelatory aspect to worldly things, ascribing inward meaning or expressivity to objects which, oddly, already possess it. While this echoes the consistent theme running throughout Gravity's Rainbow of the reversal of heuristic sequence, it points to destiny as well—that awkward notion of affirming the unchangeable, the breach that reactionary modernism seeks to heal. Already we can see the Rocket of Gravity's Rainbow through this lens: the repository and expression of supernatural forces as well as a cutting-edge state apparatus. In interior monologue, Enzian, Weissman's protégé in "those early Rocket days" (404), notes that the Rocket leads ultimately to the Raketen-Stadt, its roots in the mid-nineteenth century and its future in totalitarianism. In order to achieve this, Enzian observes, "the Rocket has to be many things, it must answer to a number of different shapes in the dreams of those who touch it" (727), and he continues by listing a host of possible mystical narratives into which it might fit: a Manichean universe, the Torah, and so on.5 The compelling nature of the Rocket precisely recuperates the terms of this mystical sensibility; reactionary mod ernism openly and necessarily fetishizes technical objects, and in fact embeds the fetish as anterior to the object-world, reconnecting the latter to meaningful narrative and saving it from the nullity of reason. At the rocket firing site in Holland, Blicero doubts his sex-slave Katje exactly because she appears to have reasons to be in the Party, and because she is "playing at playing" (97) the sadomasochistic games with which they formalize and replicate the war outside. Bilcero cites Rilke's "Want the Change" and extends it into his own romantic desire for transformation: "To laurel, to nightingale, to wind . . . wanting it,</page><page sequence="10">Haynes 317 to be taken, to embrace, to fall toward the flame filling all the senses and . . . not to love because it was no longer possible to act. . . but to be helplessly in a condition of love" (97). Here, he distinguishes between dispassionate reason and the gravity of his own desire and destiny. Katje is a calculator and shifting signifier, untrustworthy because she doesn't want in the same way. On the other hand, engineer characters like Mondaugen and Pokier, both of whom are Blicero's servants, eagerly embrace irratio nality. Mondaugen, as John 0. Stark points out, is described as being "one of those German mystics who grew up reading Hesse, Stefan George, and Richard Wilhelm, ready to accept Hitler on the basis of Demian-metaphysics, he seemed to look at fuel and oxidizer as paired opposites" (403); the engineer's mathematical theory of lowered "personal bandwidth," or dwelling in the now, has considerable sway in the novel. Miklos Thanatz, another character closely associated with Blicero, compares the V2 itself to the infant Jesus, with many Herods chasing after it. He suggests that "it really did possess a Max Weber charisma . . . some joyful—and deeply irrational—force the State bureaucracy could never routinize" (464). Contra Weber, the Reich seeks to cultivate, not diminish, such auratic power. And Blic ero himself, who, Thanatz explains, "had left 1945, wired his nerves back into the pre-Christian earth we fled across, into the Urstoff of the primitive German, God's poorest and most panicked creature," is a Kulturkreatur who now, less timidly, "deep, out of its silence . . . wakes, and sings" (464). Correspondingly, as much as unreason is deployed for its own qualities here, it is also through the Rilkean Blicero that some of the novel's best-known and most trenchant assaults on Enlightenment reason as original sin are voiced. Filtered through the lens of the Ele gies, Blicero's voice offers a requiem to Zivilisation: "my mountain gentian knew" he says, "about the edge of the world," (722), indi cating Africa and the Conradian limit to Western thought. If Europe exported a life-hating, word-loving, apocalyptic Protestantism to the New World, Blicero opines, now "American Death has come to occupy Europe," reflecting perhaps on the Fordist mode of extermination with which he is involved, both in terms of the Mittelwerke Rocket factory and the Dora concentration camp from which it draws its labor. Per haps too he shares with Rilke that distaste for America noted above: its "dummies of life," or modes of endless reproducibility. American Death, like a return of the repressed, embodies that disenchanted and mechanical death always immanent to Enlightenment reason.6 Hence Blicero suggests with the poet that modernity remains at odds with a meaningful notion of death: "It has never in love, become one with . . ." (723), he begins, his speech dwindling to the ellipses it imports</page><page sequence="11">318 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" from Rilke's verse, "death" his unspoken telos. The consummation of such intimate Liebestod, will be for Blicero the sacrifice of his lover Gottfried, the Aryan inverse of Enzian, in the firing of the 00000 V2, the ur-Rocket.7 This act, a metonym for the Reich project, is "the sting that knowledge must turn against itself" in order to be free (Nietzsche 85). Sacrifice heals the split between reason and desire, the hole in the heart of Zivilisation, and shows a particular version of the "Deathkingdom" (723) that Blicero imagines, in which Eros and Thanatos are indistinguishable. It reflects too the sublime perspective of Rilke's First Elegy angels who "would be unable to tell / whether they moved among living or dead" (Duino 29). The technical quali ties of the Rocket serve finally as the spectacular vehicle for Blicero's desire to be the tragic, Wagnerian lover. Drawn in space, the parabola of Rocket flight, like the rainbow that supplies the novel's central figure, follows just this thematic line. The curve is only a section of its whole shape, emerging mystically "out of the other silent world" wherein it completes its circle (726): "Heart," "plexus," "dream of motion," "cyst of the eternal present" (302), as we hear earlier in the novel—dreams of the absolute—are to be located not in the corny spectacles of Nuremburg but in the mathematical point at which the Rocket passes beyond control. Wit ness the Rocket becoming sentient, using the characteristic Rilkean "you" (du) form of self-address, about to reach the Brenschluss point of indeterminacy: "—the control surfaces twitch, to steer you back on course the instant you'd begin to wander off (how could you've kept from lapsing, up here, into that radiant inattention, so caught up in the wind, the sheer altitude ... the unimaginable fires at your feet?)" (517). In the language of the V2 here, we hear resemblances of the "open" [das Offene], "the radiant inattention," we find throughout Rilke. In Sonnet 1:3, for example: "A nothing-breath. A ripple in the god. A wind." Or Sonnet 1:4: "Oh, but the open air. . . oh, but the empty spaces" (7-9), reminding us of the ongoing motif in these verses of poetic breath respiring in the "Aether" of refigured nature (726): Orphic song as Being. Cognate with inner space, Rilke's notion of the "open" is signaled also in the First Elegy when we are told that "even the noticing beasts are aware / that we don't feel very securely at home / in this interpreted world" (Duino 25). In Heidegger's view, the "open" is Nature, or Being experienced in a way "unsheltered" by the "I," by instrumentality, by representative thought or signposts. Subject does not confront object but is drawn toward, "attracted," perhaps like those royal moths mentioned earlier, to "unbarriered" Being (Heidegger 212). Between the break from its determined path and its falling as "pure ballistic" (Pynchon, Gravity's 7), the Rocket experiences what we are told is "most likely an interface between</page><page sequence="12">Haynes 319 one order of things and another" (302). The act of technical will that drives the Rocket to Brennschluss culminates in a new nature, mov ing beyond "world" to "Earth," a surrender to "gravity" as nature's innermost law. Citing that last line of the Duino Elegies, "when a happy thing falls," Hohmann points out that "For Rilke, to 'fall' means to submit to the gravitational pull until one eventually comes to rest at the point where everything should always have been" (296), a reassertion, we might say, of order or destiny. That this gesture is associated in Gravity's Rainbow with National Socialism is made yet more clear through Pokier who, as both Rocket engineer and archetypical lackey, performs "ritual submissions to the Master of this night space ... the male embodiment of a technologique that embraced power not for its social uses but for just those chances of surrender... to the Void, to delicious and screaming collapse" (578). Weirdly feminized and Francophone, Germanic technology loosens itself from its role as part of state apparatus to become the imaginary medium of reconciliation between life and death. In Pökler's case, the link between "collapse," or "fall," and "destiny" is made explicitly political and class-bound in the comments of his wife, Leni, a would-be revolutionary. The destiny he turns to is really, she says, that of "the same detestable Bürgerlichkeit as your father. ... fly from pain to duty, from joy to work, from commitment to neutrality. Destiny does all this to you" (162). Without the self-definition of revolution, the German bourgeois is historically dislocated, condemned to repetition, susceptible to il lusion. As the narrator suggests, "the kinds of revenants that found Franz, [were] not persons but forms of energy, abstractions" (161), a techno-mythological history, we might say, into which a certain kind of German identity might dissolve. Lacking a specifically histori cal task, the German middle class gratefully commits suicide and is swallowed by the State. One is tempted to find behind this erotic desire for technologique Freud's assertion from Beyond the Pleasure Principle that "the aim of all life is death" (32), life forced to make "ever more complicated detours before reaching its aim of death" (33). Binding in all mis creant desires, even the Eros of progress, the gravitational pull, or attraction of death recalls Rilke's late poem "Gravity" (1924). Here, like Freud's desire for a return to inanimacy, "The standing man: as drink through thirst / gravity rushes through him," is contrasted to the sleeper who mimics death and from whom falls, "as from a cloud at rest, / gravity's plentiful rain" (Unofficial 101). The "thirst" of upwardness, higher desire, or consciousness marks its own lack, distance from, or lament for the plenitude of surrender. In these terms, the Rocket project as metonym of the Reich project suggests</page><page sequence="13">320 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" itself as a necessary detour affirming Nature itself, the latter seen as a transience tending toward extinction.

Dick, in The Man in the High Castle, uses the Jewish character Baynes to suggest some thing similar about Nazism: "Their view is 'cosmic,'" he thinks, "The cosmic process is hurrying on, crushing life back into the granite and methane . . . these madmen—respond to the granite, the dust, the longing of the inanimate; they want to aid Natur" (45). Impersonation of Life If for a Blicerean reading of Rilke, Freud's maxim that "death is the aim of life" is useful, a curious inversion of this is also at work in Gravity's Rainbow, in which life seems the aim of death. Certainly there are countless references to the reanimation of the inanimate, a rather different notion of love-death to the one above. This is especially evident in the séance scene between Walter Rathenau, the Jewish businessman and politician murdered by gangsters of the right, and Smaragd, the director of I. G. Farben and senior Nazi Party member. Behind the narrative of industrial conspiracy, the ghost of the former foreign minister, speaking through the medium Peter Sascha, hints that unfettered industrial progress is performing an ontological inversion of the world. Discussing the evolution of the petrochemical industries in an idiom that calls up that of German existentialists like Heidegger—"revealing," "unfolding," and so forth, a language of which Adorno accuses Rilke of being a key architect, Rathenau explains that: A thousand different molecules waited in the preterite dung. This is the sign of revealing. Of unfolding. This is one mean ing of mauve, the first new color on Earth, leaping to Earth's light from its grave miles and eons below.. . . But this is all the impersonation of life. The real movement is not from death to any rebirth. It is from death to death-transfigured. . . . You think you'd rather hear about what you call 'life': the growing, organic Kartell. But it's only another illusion. A very clever robot. The more dynamic it seems to you, the more deep and dead, in reality, it grows. (166-67) Alighting as ever on the odd historical detail, Pynchon demonstrates that something as apparently "given" as the color mauve is in fact derived from coal-tar chemistry. Unlike the colors of the rainbow, mauve is the outcome of work on nature and is at least as social as it is innate in geochemistry. Indeed, first produced by Perkin in 1856, mauve dye is akin to a modern alchemy, its discovery inaugurating</page><page sequence="14">Haynes 321 the synthetic dye, chemical and then plastics industries. All of these were, of course, staples of the German economy, the securing of which played a part in the rise of the Third Reich and which figure widely in Gravity's Rainbow. Like gold, the alchemist's goal, mauve blurs the distinction between the natural and the social, although both are commodities. So when Rathenau suggests that such commodi ties are death-transfigured (quite literally in the case of coal), life impersonated, or that the Kartell is robotic, the kind of inversion we might associate with Marx's view of the relation between people and objects seems indicated—one that differs from the fetish of volkisch forces driving Blicero's reactionary modernism and raising different specters from beneath the soil. For Marx, commodities are fetishistic in the sense that they recast the social characteristics of labor—producing, exchanging and consuming use-values—as the "objective characteristics of the products of labor themselves, as the socio-natural properties of these things" (Capital 1164). As a result, value, which Marx insists derives from living labor time "congealed" in the object (Capital 1130), ap pears inherent in the commodity itself, the latter subsequently ap pearing to have a life of its own. Indeed, naturalized value extends beyond the purely quantitative dimension, imbuing the world of "things" with uncanny, subjective properties. In Gravity's Rainbow, the Rocket is the paradigm for this, and its Weberian aura of tech nological autonomy may be understood this way too. Many episodes in the novel address something similar. Take "The Story of Byron the Bulb." Byron's narrative—describing the life of the urban-mythical "immortal" light bulb—leads us from Baby Bulb Heav en, where infant bulbs are coddled, awaiting manufacture, through to Byron's rather immobile participation in struggles between the tallow, tungsten, and power industries, and on to his rollicking adventures as an anti-Grid dissident and prophet, ultimately "condemned to go on forever, condemned to knowing the truth and powerless to change anything" (655), like Benjamin's angel. As Bloom suggests, adjacent to his tale are many of the concerns of the novel, from cartelization to holocaust. Yet we might note too that by granting the bulb a soul, or Seele, as the filaments were called in Germany, and a life before manufacture, Pynchon ironically projects onto the commodity sub jective characteristics, up to and including private existence and the desire to organize collectively against the exploitative power system: the "thing" as political animal. What Byron's story does, and this is a gesture repeated through out Gravity's Rainbow, is invert the relationships between things and people that commodity society generates. The title for the novel's first part—"Beyond the Zero"—indicates this move. The zero point,</page><page sequence="15">322 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" repeatedly associated with ahistorical, neutral consciousness, even the nullity of death, conjures the totalizing quality of the commod ity fetish in industrial capitalism, a kind of consciousness degree zero. Beyond the zero, however, refers to other spaces and states from which the latter might be deconstructed—the afterlife, dream, fantasy, critique, novel-writing and so forth. Ostensibly in Gravity's Rainbow the phrase alludes to a Pavlovian phenomenon from the Pointsman narrative, where a learned stimulus is not just zeroed, or removed entirely through aversion therapy, but further removed to become "a silent extinction beyond the zero" (85). This barely imaginable negative space on the other side of empirical reality and rational behavior finds many analogues in the narrative. The narra tor suggests that "Those like Slothrop, with the greatest interest in discovering the truth, were thrown back on dreams, psychic flashes, omens, cryptographies, drug-epistemologies, all dancing on a ground of terror, contradiction, absurdity" (582). Simple empiricism, then, will not do when it comes to "the truth." Marx also stresses the difficulty of penetrating life degree zero. Maintaining the somewhat Gothic register of the commodity's "im personation of life"—and there is much in Gravity's Rainbow too that alludes to the Gothic—Marx argues that what might appear to be a simple illusion regarding the intrinsic value of objects actually effects what we might call an ontological reversal of social subject and object, something occurring as part of the transition to a standard money form in which commodity society achieves its recognizably modern appearance. Money raises the autonomy, promiscuity, and inscrutabil ity of the commodity to a new level. Marx says that in the advent of money, the commodity, a "born leveler and cynic . . . always ready to exchange not only soul, but body with each and every other com modity" (Capital1179), is provided with an imagined basis in nature. "This physical object, gold or silver in its crude state, becomes, im mediately on its emergence from the bowels of the earth, the direct incarnation of all human labor. Hence the magic of money. . . . The riddle of the money fetish is therefore the riddle of the commodity fetish, now become visible and dazzling to our eyes" (Capital 1187). But the dazzle also deceives. Gold-money materializes labor yet at the same time disavows and buries it, or encrypts it, we might say. The very finished form money adopts completes its illusion of autochthony and creates a reversal; by emerging as an apparently natural, ready-made value from the ground, gold instates itself as the origin of all value, awaiting discovery and recognition. On the other hand, values created by work in society—that is, for Marx, all val ues—appear as mere reflections of this anterior model. Furthermore, "the movement through which this process has been mediated," Marx</page><page sequence="16">Haynes 323 observes, "vanishes in its own result, leaving no trace behind" (187). So, before money, exchange is visibly social; afterwards, there ap pear no social relations at all apart from those uncanny ones between things. Indeed, Marx's word for the process of monetary valuation, verrueckt, means "displaced, mad, or absurd" (Murray 62-3), quali ties money somehow normalizes. One might be reminded here of Rathenau's account of the preterit dung, reanimated as a second nature, transmogrified into the controlling apparatus of the Kartell. Perhaps it is important then that the perception of this process oc curs from beyond the grave, or the other side of the zero—the place of ghosts and revenants. It is here that Rilke steps back into the picture, potentially offer ing a way to break the terms of the fetish. His Sonnets to Orpheus, associated closely with Gravity's Rainbow's central protagonist Tyrone Slothrop, stage a return to nature and a process of constant meta morphosis and transaction with the soil, the underworld, the dead and a re-enchanted notion of life mediated through the god of song. Orpheus "came the way ore comes, from silent / rock" (Sonnets 15), the poem says. At the same time, employing Rilke's longstanding symbol for absolute being, the rose, we understand that "Orpheus is the rose. His metamorphosis / takes this form, that form" (Sonnets 11). And, as Hohmann notes, his transformation or Verwandlung is imagined by Rilke as an equation of being and singing—"Gesang ist Dasein," "song is being" (Sonnets 6). As I noted above, part of this alchemy is to transform "things" from their secular, quotidian purpose into something ineffable and non-instrumental—a task to be achieved through song, or sometimes, as in the Elegies, by a pure saying. Paul de Man sees in Rilke a poetic subject who recognizes that he cannot appropriate anything: "The determining figure of Rilke's poetry is that of chiasmus, the crossing that reverses the attributes of words and of things. The poems are composed of entities, objects and subjects, who themselves behave like words," (38). Other writers imagine such saying to be a kind of critique, specifically of instrumental reason and the metaphysics of the subject. Blanchot follows Heidegger and Bataille when he writes that Orphic song exhausts itself in iteration, working as "the happy consumption of being when, without reserve, it enters into the movement where nothing is preserved, which does not realize, accomplish or save anything, which is the pure felicity of descending, the joy of the fall, the jubilant word which one unique time gives voice to disappearance, before disappearing into it" (145). Heidegger's Rilke turns against a modernity in which, "every thing ... is relentlessly turned into the material of self-asserting production. . . . Man becomes a human material that is applied to goals that have been set out before him" (217). Das Offene, inner</page><page sequence="17">324 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" space, notions of remembrance, for Heidegger, all slip the nets of such technical enframing, retracing the tracks of the "fugitive gods," the metaphorical Titans inherited from Hölderlin (202). Slothrop, as a kind of parodie Orpheus, is much in tune with these gestures. A condensation of "sloth"—which elsewhere Pynchon praises as a Bartlebyesque refusal to "go on interacting anymore with the daily order" (Pynchon, "Deadly")—and "entropy"—which unworks order—Slothrop as Orpheus enacts a rebuke to enframing. A key player and stooge in the labyrinthine conspiracies of the novel, finally he returns to "green valleyed Earth," "nothing in his head, just feeling natural" (Gravity's 626). Thus he passes over to a prelapsarian order that Geli Tripping, the young German witch, envisages in a way consonant with this post-Heideggerian Rilke and the kind of politics it articulates: "The World before men. Too violently pitched alive in constant flow ever to be seen by men directly. They are meant only to look at it dead, in still strata, transputrified to oil or coal. Alive it was a threat: it was Titans. ... So we, the crippled keepers, were sent out to multiply, to have dominion. God's spoilers. Us. Counter revolutionaries" (720). But closer inspection of Slothrop's history in the novel and the equation with Rilke's sonnets alters this reading. The apparent du alism that valorizes Earth and Being over human consciousness is made more complex in Gravity's Rainbow by another set of Orphic exchanges between worlds. Pynchon, I argue, is far closer here to Marx than to Heidegger, who locates a Utopian moment in Rilke's antihumanist withdrawal from appropriative subjecthood: nature as openness, that simple "speak, I am," echoed by Pynchon (622). Al though there is something Heideggerian about Pynchon's critique of an epochal technicism (for which we might read "commodification"), especially centered around "the bomb," Gravity's Rainbow, like Capi tal, presents nature and natural value not as given, but as symptoms of the inverted reality of commodity society, the pivotal moment of which is the assumption of the intrinsic worth of gold-money. References to gold proliferate throughout Pynchon's narrative, although often obliquely. Soviet imperialist Tchitcherine's robotic limp is "permanent as gold" (337); Mary Beat's stories of mountain folk who learn to excrete gold are noted; Jay Gould's cornering of the gold market and squandering on railroads in 1869 is hidden in a reference to a vernacular phrase; and a reference to Greed, Eric von Stronheim's 1924 film version of Frank Norris' novel McTeague, about gold rush miners and hoarders, hides there too. More pertinently, the association of Slothrop with Rilke's Orpheus opens an intertextual connection to the whole poem sequence, in which can be detected an abiding monetary and auric trope.</page><page sequence="18">Haynes 325 As I suggested, prevailing images of forge and flame in Rilke, who compared himself to a goldsmith, valorize both an original mak ing, or coining, and notions of natural right. We encounter the same theme in the Eliotic underworld sequence of Gravity's Rainbow in the form of a goldsmith's shop: a sun "like a forge" is in the west, quickly reprised as "the anxiety of pedestrians staring in the tiny storefront window at the dim goldsmith behind his fire at his work"—a demi urge figure "afraid because the light looks like it's going to go away forever this time" (548). The essence of Orpheus is also universal changeability, like money. And, as with Marx's money, changeability is underwritten by reference to a transcendental value. Orpheus emerges, Rilke writes, "the way ore comes, from silent rock," like gold (Orpheus 15).8 Indeed, the message of the Sonnets—to recognize the paradoxical identity between the lament of departure and the act of rejoicing—seems to cast the poetic subject as social object, the alteration of forms like a currency circulating and changing role. Finitude is embraced as the sign of the infinite and form suggests divine flux, an idea memorably caught in the Ninth Elegy where "heart" exists "between hammers" and the tongue "lives between its own teeth" (Rilke, Duino 85). "Be ahead of all partings, as if they were behind you," we are told in Sonnet 2:13; "be the glass 'that shatters itself with sound" (81). In Sonnet 2:19, a beggar importunes an anthropomorphized money, which "dresses in furs and carnations and silk." The beggar appears "to be caught / in Money's pause between breaths"; "can his wide-open hand never close?" (93), the poem asks. This exorbitant open hand renders das Offene, interstitial to, and corrosive of, the rhythms of breathing, living money. But the poem begins with the line "Gold lives somewhere in the bank." Gold here, translator Stephen Cohn tells us in his notes on the poem, is "almost a concept of beauty . . . nearly but not quite equivalent to money" (156). In the fine distinction between worldly money and cloistered gold, something like the distinction between price and value is posited. Beggar and gold refer to the transcendent; money is its inauthentic placeholder. Similarly, in the Tenth Elegy, the Trostmarkt grades into a sideshow signposted "(for adults only): the breeding of money! Anatomy made amusing! Money's organs on view! Nothing concealed" (Rilke, Duino 93), giving us the apparent self-accumulation of anthropomorphic capital, within which, Marx tells us, the appropria tion of surplus value is hidden. Yet, although he exposes an illusion, Rilke simply decries it as the ontologically inauthentic world, behind the billboards of which is not labor but the death-kingdom into which the youth forays, where "griefstone" mined from the volcano by the "princes" is the more authentic currency.</page><page sequence="19">326 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" All the above cases are presaged in a poem from Rilke's earlier Poems from the Book of Hours where the crowns of defunct sover eigns are ground to specie by the "rabble" (qtd. in Heidegger 219); however, the verse continues: The ore is homesick. Its desire is to forsake the coins and wheels that teach it to live small. And from the factories and from the tills it will return into the earthly veins; the adits of the mountains close behind it on its return. So far from exposing the commodity fetish, Rilke reconfirms it, aristo cratically swiping at the petite bourgeois and bourgeoisie who debase the natural order as he does so. While there is a similar conception of the subject as object, it is exactly this physiocratic fetish of buried treasure that Pynchon's Orpheus debunks, preferring instead a more dynamic model where, as above, attention is paid to what is buried and what exhumed. Gravity's Rainbow is a novel about how the liv ing and dead interact and in which necropolises abound as the site of such exchanges—the Slothrops' Massachusetts graveyard; the financial center of Geneva, reflected in its lake like Rilke's Bruges; and the Reich capital, Berlin, are all described thus.9 Slothrop passes into other underworlds: the Mittelwerke V2 factory; below decks on the death-ship Anubis, a Luger replacing a lyre, failing with Eurydice; and finally the crossroads in the Zone. Such mediation between Pluto and the living reaches a critical point when, in narrative analepsis, a Magician pulls a mandrake root from the spot of Slothrop's purported scattering, using its folkloric properties to multiply money tenfold and drawing down the attention of the Committee on Idiopathic Arche types (CIA), interested in its "basic structure"; "Capital?" says the Magician, "Never heard of that" (625). "Recycled" as a monetary entity, and as the magic or sleight of hand by which capital apparently regenerates itself, hidden inside the commodification of labor, Slothrop's connection between the living and chthonic suggests he has, in a way, always been an Orphic figure. His family background, outlined early in the novel figures him as the scion of a dying, typically American Puritan bourgeois dynasty. The grow ing necropolis of Slothrops, including Constant and his son Variable Slothrop (names punning on types of capital), lies in Mingeborough, MA, "Each one in turn paying his debt to nature due and leaving the excess to the next link in the name's chain" (27). Over its history, the narrator tells us, the family have conducted business from early fur trading to later marble quarrying; from their graves, "The money</page><page sequence="20">Haynes 327 seeping its way out through stock portfolios more intricate than any genealogy" (27). More recently, they have cut timber to produce "toi let paper, banknote stock, newsprint—a medium or ground for shit, money, and the Word" later called "the three American truths" (28). The narrator reminds us of the Emily Dickinson poem that tells us, "Slipping is crash's law," and we discover that, "The profits slacken ing, the family ever multiplying . . . Interest from various numbered trusts was still turned, by family banks down in Boston every second or third generation, back into yet another trust, in long rallentando, in infinite series just perceptibly, term by term, dying ... but never quite to the zero" (28). Pynchon's characteristically long sentence, with its deliberately awkward syntax, subordinate clauses, and el lipses, mimics the slowdown and encroaching chaos of the Slothrop rallentando. Living Slothrops are thus dependent on the dead, entropically wearing away values that have already been created and preserved in trusts. When the Slothrops reach into the ground to grasp Pluto's head, it is not fresh gold they retrieve but "dead" capital, and by extension "dead" labor, using the things that have already been used, reanimating the profits once drawn from living bodies in a process Marx calls "metempsychosis," or the transmigration of souls.10 Si multaneously, as is the way of trusts, dead capital is thrown out as money capital and profits accrue from new surplus values. Uncannily, the share portfolios grow more complex than human genealogy, paths are drawn between necropolis and the living; in spectral suspension, the dead never quite finish dying. Economies of waste, recuperation, and information—shit, money, and word—circulate as living labor surrenders to the dead.11 Meanwhile, more recent generations of Slothrops struggle with and abuse natural resources always on the verge of exhaustion that Marx, in a definition of entropy rarely used by Pynchon scholars, identified as the tendency of profits to fall. Even as constant capital or raw materials increase in quantity and quality, labor or variable capital cannot yield infinite surplus value: slipping is crash's law in deed. Capitalism both produces and requires entropy. Money tends toward shit, naturally. Fixes for this must always be found, which is perhaps why, out in the woods, the Slothrops are like miners of paper currency to facilitate capital expansion. In later plot developments, we discover that this paper has been used by major Slothrop stockholder Lyle Bland, dealing with German businessman Hugo Stinnes, as the unofficial "Mefo bills" used in Weimar Germany to rearm behind the back of the Versailles treaty and involved also in the 1922 Inflation. Another fix for falling profit rates, Pynchon thus suggests, is war—the Slothropian necropolis exercising a dread influence over later genera</page><page sequence="21">328 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" tions. As Mister Information says, "Yesyes, Skippy, the truth is that the War is keeping things alive. Things. . . . The Germans-and-Japs story was only one, rather surrealistic version of the real War. The real War is always there" (645). Slothrop himself is of course deeply imbricated in this process. Sold as an infant by his father and Bland to IG Farben for sexual experiments with their new plastic, he literal izes the fetish in all its senses, working in the novel always towards defetishization and beyond the zero of his programming, to regain "The Penis He Thought Was His Own" (216), which is perhaps why he occupies the liminal, Orphic position. Hohmann maintains that part of Pynchon's parody of Rilke's Orpheus is the "recycling" of Slothrop "into the System" after his implied disintegration, denying any spirituality to the event (346). Certainly his transitions into money suggest this. But the transitive Orphic movement acts also as a counterpoint to Blicero's reading of Rilke. Slothrop's transformations effect a critique of that appeal to Nature-as-Being we saw first in reactionary modernism, and then as an existentialist mode of the critique of capitalism. Against Rilke's version of the character, Pynchon's Orpheus presents nature as some thing always already worked, socialized, and ordered. It does not exist as an outside, an other, an Earth, or as natural hierarchy or tragedy, which is how Slothrop can move between orders. Geli Tripping's primal Titans exist only as phantoms, as we note when Roger Mexico and Pig Bodine stage battles with giant rubber "phalli" as "unemployed Augustes" in whiteface and working clothes. "Seems people can be reminded of Titans and Fathers, and laugh. It isn't as funny as a pie in the face, but it's at least as pure," the narrator comments (708). The message of Gravity's Rainbow is thus that the volkisch fetish of, for example, the Rocket is actually facilitated by that of commodity fetishism; fascism is a subsystem of capitalism itself, a point made abundantly clear through the narratives of industrial paranoia and conspiracy in the novel. The point is to arrest or subvert the relent less "forwardness" or destinarian character with which both natural ize themselves and recognize the temporal disorder that inheres in the transmission of capital, as Slothrop's genealogy demonstrates. In one of his rare moments of pathos with Pointsman, the narrator reprises this point when considering the Rocket death of Pavlovian Kevin Spectro, whose name itself suggests that ghostly return noted above. In a powerful echo of the Book of Hours poem, Pointsman laments the intransitivity of death when he considers that: Nothing can really stop the Abreaction of the Lord of the Night unless the Blitz stops, rockets dismantle, the entire film runs backward: faired skin back to sheet metal back</page><page sequence="22">Haynes 329 to pigs to white incandescence to ore, to Earth. But the reality is not reversible. Each firebloom, followed by blast, then sound of arrival, is a mockery (how can it not be de liberate?) of the reversible process: with each one the Lord further legitimizes his State. (139) Like Kurt Vonnegut's narrative reversal of the bombing of Dresden in Slaughterhouse-Five (1969), where the healing bombs are safely collected by American female munitions workers, this sequence em ploys the technique of inversion encountered throughout Gravity's Rainbow, not least in the hysteron proteron of the supersonic arrival of the machine, exploding before it is heard falling.12 Dealing with the notion of abreaction, a kind of post-traumatic catharsis, and hence with more notions of the untimely, Pointsman's inner mono logue materializes the origin in work of all that the "faired skin" of the blonded, anthropomorphic Rocket contains. Citing the process and vocabulary of the anonymous labor of steel manufacture, the passage stages the latter's return as repressed content, leading us to an underworld that is also the state capitalism generating the Rocket's conditions of production. Rather than national destiny, or autonomous technicity, the Rocket secretes a labor performed as an imperative of the command class of National Socialism, just as the ICBM that closes Gravity's Rainbow proceeds from the needs of the postwar elect. Surely there is a parallel here too with the events of the Roseland Ballroom, where Slothrop's voyage into the toilet pits "living" shit against the white porcelain that is the "very emblem of Odorless and Official Death" (688). As Christopher Ames points out, the incident harnesses "the essential force of scatology and obscen ity—the exposing of what should be hidden, the voicing of what should be silent, and the association of those forces with the oppressed" (199). The symbolic economy he describes has powerful links with the material one. This sense of openness to the pressure of the past, of memory, the repressed and encrypted are vital to the way in which "the re versible process" is used in the passage, and indeed the whole novel. This is why the merely technical confusion of perception the Rocket generates is simple mockery. Apart, perhaps, from Roger and Jes sica's love affair, what attenuated "redemptive" moments there are in Gravity's Rainbow seem to involve such untimeliness: Pökler's decision, for example, not to have sex with his "daughter" Ilse (although per-versely and obscenely Pynchon depicts it), detaches him retrospectively from obedience to "the program," providing "the real moment of conception, in which, years too late, he became her father" (421). This, despite the fact it is unclear whether any of the</page><page sequence="23">330 "Gravity Rushes Through Him" girls annually sent to him are even the same, let alone his daughter. For Jessica Swanlake, in another kind of rebirth, and an extraordinary multi-page tour de force of associative prose countering the "dream less version of the real" (129) that Pynchon suggests is produced by war, Christmas 1944 is "the Nativity, a violence, a nova of the heart that will turn us all, change us forever to the very forgotten roots of who we are" (133). Earlier in the same passage, which begins in a country church: "The plaster baby, the oxen frosted with gold leaf and the human-eyed sheep are turning real again, paint quickens to flesh" (133). Just as for Marx, the "misty realm of religion" (Capital 165) is simultaneously both an index of alienation and the encryption of whatever of Utopia society can muster (Marx, Early Writings 255), so the fetishized "real" of commodities—along with the social formations codependent with it—contains the same ambiguity or contradiction. Gold, we might remember, embodies labor at the same time as it displaces and vanishes it: even the most material social object is shot through with abstraction, immateriality, and unrealized potential. Hence the importance of Jessica's dream-reality, the transubstantia tions of which make the gilded figures of Nativity permeable to the wish images of redemption, coming back to life from the reified realm, humanizing the human-eyed sheep. At certain moments, it seems, the subject irruptively discovers itself in the panoply of objectified social relations, a profoundly subjectifying and transformative mo ment of recognition in the mirror of socius. In this sense, Pynchon's Orphic prose insists on a reversibility that Rilke's poetry denies. Despite its close attention to the proximity of a redemptive "other world," in Rilke's work, the two do not interpenetrate. Even in Sonnet 2:1, where, with great intimacy, our "Breath" is an "invisible poem" "freely exchanging / a measure of World for our being," the displaced air remains only the "rind" (57), of speech and poetry, never really incorporated; poetic subject and world-object unite only on the "other side." Like the retreat beaten by gold behind the adits of the moun tains, Rilke represents a dualistic world for which Pynchon seeks a middle term. The transitive Slothrop might be regarded as just that. Notes 1. Thum and Taxis are the historically real but fictionalized secret mail service in Pynchon's 1966 novel, The Crying of Lot 49. 2. Tchitcherine and Enzian are also both associated with Rilke given that the whole Kirghiz Light section echoes the Tenth Elegy.</page><page sequence="24">Haynes 331 3. Tyrone Slothrop, like many of Pynchon's character names, is a compendium of diverse allusions: entropy is a theme throughout his writing and the title of a 1960 short story; "sloth" is the deadly sin Pynchon wrote about for a New York Times series in 1993 ("The Deadly Sins"); and the name seems also a reference to John Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony and so one of Slothrop's Puritan forebears, a group with whom the current essay is concerned. 4. Charles Hohmann notes that Slothrop 's "Celestial Cyclist" constel lation (Pynchon, Gravity's 509) might comment on the Rider Sonnet or the Tenth Elegy (Hohmann 323). 5. Deborah Madsen argues that this is Pynchon's Foucauldian mes sage—hegemonic discourse is both the pretext and site of power. 6. See Adorno and Horkheimer, Dialectic of Enlightenment, p. 57. 7. Hohmann argues that the German Romantic topos of death-love (,Liebestod) is not present in the Elegies and Pynchon's attention to it misreads Rilke. It is, however, Blicero who reads here, not Pynchon. See Hohmann, 316. 8. In Pynchon perhaps the shift is to "black gold," another important currency in 1973. 9. See Man (41) for a discussion of this. 10. This is an extension of what Marx intends by "dead labour"; he refers to the use of commodities to make more commodities in the pro duction process. This can apply to financial products too. See Marx (Capital I 314). 11. It's hard not to see comparisons with The Crying of Lot 49 here: W.A.S.T.E. systems and estates in trust appear there too.
