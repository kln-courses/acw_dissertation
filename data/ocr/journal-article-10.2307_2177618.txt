<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, igio.' T HE activity in 'religious philosophy' and in the 'philosophy of religions,' which last year produced so many interesting works, since then has not been so fertile; but it has not ceased. M. Victor Monod, in his Probleme de Dieu et la th~ologie Chr~tienne depuis la RMforme, combines keen insight with a large use of historical material in an account of the manner in which the change in social ideals has transformed the theology of God as sovereign into one of God as moral person.2 M. Segond, in his thesis for the doctorat-es-lettres, attempts a complete psychology of prayer, based on an analysis of the large body of evidence on the subject to be found in mystical and theological writers.3 His psychology is not of the experimental type, which studies the phenomena from without, as one indifferent to them might, but rather a psychology based on an internal analysis made by a believer, and one which even tends to a certain degree to justify what it studies. An important work left in manuscript by the late Professor J. J. Gourd, whose fine career in philosophy I commemorated in this REVIEw last year, has been published-La philosophic de la religion.4 It was unfortunately unfinished, and has been com- pleted for publication by the addition of some extracts from an earlier book, and of notes taken in the courses which the author had given on the same subject. But this retouching affects only the last few pages. Three-fourths of the book had been prepared for publication by M. Gourd himself, who desired that it should be printed, even if his illness did not permit him to complete the revision. Besides, the first part of the work, which he was able to prepare completely himself, is also that which will certainly interest philosophers most.

Boutroux gives the essential spirit of the work, and reminds us how intimately in the character of M. Gourd the man was united with the thinker. "It is not enough," he was fond of saying, " to know what philosophy teaches us; the essential thing is to practise it and to live by it." His fundamental thesis is that the supreme value consists in the enlargement of the spiritual life. This enlargement takes place in thought, in action, in art, in social life, and has a two- fold character. On the one side, it is an expansion which pro- ceeds by coordination, and as such obeys strict laws; on the other, it is an intensification, not subject to the conditions which limit it in its first form, but free from all law. This creative life of spirit, when it is conceived synthetically, and especially when it is symbolised in an ideal person, is precisely what we call religion. This presupposes a proof, in the first place, that there is an element refractory to coordination, corresponding to everything in our experience which we can coordinate, and that this in- coordinabile has the characteristics of what we call the Divine. That science consists in coordination cannot be doubted. Whether under the form of arranging perceptions in an ordered body of observations, or of the classification of particular in- stances, or of the implication of effects by causes, it always appears as a logical organisation which establishes continuities and identities. But every procedure of this kind supposes also the presence in things of a character opposed to this. The limit approached by the scientific study of causation is the absorption of the cause in its effect, their equivalence in terms of energy; but science exists only because that identity is not attained. If the effect differ in any respect from its cause, that in which it differs is an absolute novelty, and therefore an element which escapes our coordination. If, on the contrary, each fact be entirely explained by its antecedents, then there would be nothing new in it, nothing independent, nothing which was not implicit in what preceded it; every state of the world would be equivalent to that which produced it, and Eleaticism would be the only truth. Deny causal indetermination, and you at once make</page><page sequence="3">No. 5j] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 19io. 517 causal determination impossible. The same thing is true of the species and its individuals; every assimilation presupposes a di- versity which furnishes its matter. Again, we cannot convert qualities into quantities, or psychical into physical, without omit- ting from the systematic connection, which our understanding legitimately demands, a whole group of terms which are refractory to that connection, and which nevertheless alone make it possible. Perfect intelligibility would be radical identity under all cate- gories, that is, it would be nonentity. It follows, therefore, either. that nothing exists, or that reality is "thoroughly diverse " in one of its aspects. "All that is original and living in modern philosophy repudiates the identification of the real with the intelligible." This element which is refractory to theoretical coordination is then neither chance nor miracle. It is not mingled with that in things with which science deals as the tares are mingled with the wheat in a sheaf, but it makes one body with it as color does with extent, or the individual with its universal. It intro- duces no exceptions into the world of regularity, and no lacunca into that of continuity. It does not menace the results of science, for it is not 'against the law,' it is only without it. It is the Absolute, if one please, but a pure Absolute, freed from the parasitical ideas of infinity and necessity which have been often, and- very wrongly, associated with it in the history of philosophy. Nor is it the Unknowable. It does not follow because it is inaccessible to conceptual and scientific knowledge that it escapes every effort of our mind. One may comprehend it, even if it cannot be scientifically explained. The mode of thought which is proper to it, and which permits our mind to grasp it, is the direct envisaging by the mind of that which is individual. But does it pertain to religion? Yes, if one can decide to abandon the outworn forms of the religious consciousness, and retain only the essential and permanent tendency which sustains it. Religion is mystery, intuition, revelation, beyond and su- perior to understanding. In its relation to the laws of science, it is supernatural. It is the introduction of an end for which discursive knowledge is only a means. Now the incobrdinate</page><page sequence="4">5i8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. element is exactly all this. Our 'vocation as men' is a condition which dominates science, and is not itself an object of science. The positivistic attitude, experimental or mathematical, how- ever legitimate it may be, yet needs a permanent corrective. That attitude habituates us to the ideas of uniformity, stability, the inexorable necessity of things, to the thought of our depend- ence on the physical world and on society, to the sentiment of our insignificance in the face of infinite time and space. If it alone ruled us, would it not paralyse all out action? Cui bono? would be the eternal question to which no answer could ever be given. We must either give up life, or else find another possible perspective, a point of view which allows of hope and confidence, and justifies action. Faith, which makes possible the discovery of the incoordinabile, is the synthesis of these three needs. In this synthesis it gathers up all that is fruitful in the ideas of religion. If it allows the anthropomorphic images and the physical miracles in which traditional theology used to formulate its conceptions to be lost, we need not regret them. As beside science there is room for a different order of knowledge, so beside morality there is room for a practical attitude which goes beyond it, and which also deserves to be called religion. Morality is an enlargement of wills by coordination, just as science is an enlargement of intellects. It also is built up partly on the basis of similarity, and partly on that of continuity and implication. It is a system of rules which govern our life. It makes honest men, men capable doubtless of refining the ideal which their age sets before them by their delicacy, or of making it more precise by their scruples; in the end, however, men who are characterised especially by abstinence from evil, and essen- tially of the legalistic type. Now in addition to such irreproach- able conduct there are heroism and sacrifice, which make up the moral incoordinabile. This goes further than one supposes. The soldier in warfare, the pastor or the magistrate confronting arbitrary violence, the physician in the hospital, merely obey the moral law. Danger is written among the articles of their professional duty. True sacrifice is quite another thing. It is distinguished, in the first place, by the strength of its fervor.</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, i90o. 5I9 It commences with those instances in which a man, while only doing his duty so far as the quality of the act is concerned, does infinitely more by the exceptional intensity of the sentiments which he incorporates in his action. But the especial character- istic of sacrifice is the way in which it transforms the logical hierarchy of moral ends. According to the only moral code which is capable of formulation, in a case of conflict, the more urgent and fundamental needs should prevail over others. If, for example, the passion for art or science were ruining one's health, a prerequisite for so many other moral ends, it would be one's reasonable duty to abandon it. Yet who would refuse to admire those who gladly make such a sacrifice, to the detriment of ordinary and moreover justifiable moral precepts? Who would be without feeling for the supramoral grandeur in the unreason of the absolute Christian, who gives his cloak to him who de- demands his coat, and who turns his left cheek to him who has smitten his right. "Sacrifice is the irrational element in practical life; by its end as well as by its intensity, it is directly opposed to law." The moral code and sacrifice are thus distinguished as co- ordination and incoordination, in respect to the object of action, and as obligation and liberty in regard to its subject. Their opposition becomes even more striking as morality perfects itself, and carries sacrifice with itself to higher degrees of purity. At present this antinomy is a stumbling-block to theologians and even to sociologists. The only way to get rid of it is boldly to put heroism outside of morals, and in the sphere of religion. For who, so much as Christ, has baffled methodical formalists, the righteous who are merely righteous, proud of making their acts conform perfectly to the law? The folly of the cross, the folly of Christians, is the very phrase of the Apostle Paul. Loss is the essential character of sacrifice; not a momentary loss to be repaid with large interest, terrestrial or celestial, but a loss pure and simple, radical, final. And the paradoxical side of the matter, which yet cannot be denied if one consider the his- tory of moral ideals, is that this loss is a good, and perhaps the highest of all goods. There is a joy in death, not only in a</page><page sequence="6">520 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. useful and fruitful death, but in every death which is freely willed and chosen out of an heroic impulse. The splendor of the funeral march of Siegfried is due to the fact that turn by turn there burst out in it the motives of youth, of glory, and of beauty, in an ever more impressive contrast with the final sacri- fice. Is not the belief in this moral incoordinabile, which almost defies individual freedom, also one of the fundamental character- istics of religion, and especially of Christianity? Such a duality is perhaps even more evident in aesthetics. Here coordination is classic and harmonious beauty, perfection as Mendelssohn and Winckelmann understood it. It is not difficult to see in what direction the domain of art transcends this. The value of the sublime is no less high, and it can neither be systematised nor expressed by canons. It also is "without the law." It embarrasses the aesthetician just as the individual embarrasses logicians and heroism moralists. It is based on coordination, it presupposes it-since it is not a mere absurdity- but it surpasses it and makes it seem inferior. It is also ob- viously connected with religious tradition. Judaism, Hegel justly observed, is the religion of the sublime. It is because of this that the representation of God by images carved by human hands is so severely forbidden. Beauty is merely the expression of life. Trite as it may be to say it, it is a noteworthy truth that the sublime is a concrete witness to our sentiment and need for that which transcends life. Finally, in the social order as well we find coordination and an incoordinabile. The coordinative activity is present in the life of society in so far as it is a system of connections and fellow- ships, both functional and morphological, subject to rules. As elsewhere, it produces an extensive enlargement. Its progress consists in uniting the greatest possible number of individuals, so that the society may represent the greatest power possible, both materially and intellectually. Like science, it first binds beings together in concrete groups, dominated by the principles of differentiation and adaptation, as for example in a family or in a city. Then it goes on to unite them in abstract groups, on the principle of similarity, such as professional, artistic or philan-</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, i9io. 52I thropic guilds and societies. But this coordination is not the whole of social life. If the extensive enlargement of a society were the sole value involved, a small state would be wrong in jealously guarding its independence instead of enriching the vast organism of a neighboring state by allowing itself to be merged in it; and yet we regard its resistance as righteous. The reason is, that the social bond can also be enlarged intensively; in regard to social norms, as in regard to every other law, insurrec- tion is sometimes a good. The anarchist is a criminal, since he attacks the law; but great revolutionists are heroes, for they are without the law. And by that very fact, they belong to the sphere of religion: ubi spiritus, ibi libertas. The same disposition which is the source of moral sacrifice and of artistic creativeness is present also in the great transformers of the social order. The sole true Church is the Church of Freedom. This is Mysticism, if one like to call it so; but one of a very different type from that of the ecstatics who only free the soul by impoverishing it, by emptying it of all its diverse content. This mysticism, on the contrary, retains all the lower or incom- plete forms of the life of spirit, and vivifies them by its effort to keep always in contact with the incoordinabile. " In spite of our weakness, some time or other we have all been given one of those moments in which we in some way seize the true root of our life, and elevate and enlarge our whole being by a mysterious effort. The reaction was doubtless brief. Our categories and distinctions took possession of us again at once. But it is no small thing to have disengaged ourselves from them for an instant, even though imperfectly and partially, not out of weakness, but out of superabundant strength. Not only have we thus unified our spiritual life, but we have also lifted the point of departure of our different disciplines to a higher level, and have given them a richer content and a keener insight than they had before. And even if everything takes the same position as before, it is at least with new meanings, which may perhaps make possible new de- velopments." For the expression of all these sentiments, for their consecration and effective evocation, it is well to retain the name of God, freed</page><page sequence="8">522 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. from the outworn and inadmissible forms of traditional theology. The God of orthodoxy, useless to science, dangerous to morality, a mere hypostasis of the lower and conservative types of law, should be replaced by a conception which is not new, but really older than it, that which animated nascent Christianity and which fermented also in the souls of the first Reformers. God is no longer to be the Universal Being, but rather the Absolute; He is not to be the creator and controller of nature, but rather the liberator from its oppressive systematisations, the luminous centre of our hopes and of our possible consolations. And since He is thus the ideal expression of personality, we should conceive Him as personal and as free. A divine person is the only ade- quate symbol of incoordinate values, of what is 'beyond the law,' of the absolute. Thus we may retain all that is vital in tradi- tional Christianity, especially in its Protestant form. "Without laying rash and disrespectfully revolutionary hands upon it," we may yet animate it with a spirit which shall free it from the formalism and bondage of the Law. Such are the principal lines of M. J. J. Gourd's argument. I have been obliged, in order to make them clear, to omit the abundant ingenuity and philosophical subtlety of the details. Even in the guise of this very dry summary, perhaps, the reader may have felt that this is not only the last work of an able mind, but also the testament of a great soul. To be sure, the work belongs to its age in many respects. It takes its place with exact precision in the movement of liberal Protestantism, which grows stronger from day to day. And it is also true that without the dissolvent criticism of Bergson and of William James, it would not have been possible, even for a fellow-countryman of Secretan, to have expressed so completely his profound faith in that which is 'beyond the law.' Yet these are after all conditions, not causes, of the book; the doctrine of the incoordinabile is itself a manifestation of the spontaneity which it analyses. It is of course open to grave objections. The two points most open to attack, in my opinion, are the radical identification of the incoordinabile with the divine, a step which it in many ways</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, I9io. 523 resists; and the failure to give sufficient consideration to the fact that moral progress involves a common aim, a task which is being accomplished, so that great moral innovations, however unfore- seeable and inexplicable they may be as to their circumstances, yet take their place in a convergent series, and thus supply matter for a higher form of coordination. The Absolute, as M. Gourd defines it, seems to me matter and means much more than end. But of how many meanings that term admits! They have almost nothing in common save the sentiments of ultimate value and of moral satisfaction which accompany them. In another work in pure metaphysic which has just appeared, and which shows the same desire to justify its author's faith, and to give a proper place to the Absolute, this term has a different and almost precisely opposite meaning, since it stands for complete coordination. The work of which I speak is a study, partly historical and partly polemical, which M. Charles Dunan has just published under the title of Les deux idealismes.1 The pars destruens is the larger one in this work. In fact, ac ording to th author, it is not even necessary to destroy; we need only to open our eyes to discover that all that lies before us is in ruins. All the metaphysical structures which men have tried to raise during the last three centuries have at once crumbled into dust. Public opinion has even come to take absolutely no interest in them, and uses the very name of metaphysics only as a term of disparagement. The chapter entitled "Modern Philosophy Judged by Itself" is extremely severe, but also extremely interesting, because of its entire lack of any com- plaisance or consideration. What has been done in the problem of knowledge? The ancients and the scholastics stated the true problem of Idealism with admirable clearsightedness. Is there, or is there not, anything supraphenomenal involved in the phe- nomena of nature and in man himself? Is sensation quite crude, or is it interpenetrated by an ideal element? For the problem thus stated, and properly stated, Descartes substituted that of the origin of ideas, which led philosophy astray and made its discussions sterile. For two centuries the question whether there 1 One volume I2mo, Alcan.</page><page sequence="10">524 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. are 'innate ideas' was discussed. To-day the opinion is fixed that there are none of the kind of which Descartes was thinking. And as the Cartesian position was the representative, although a very misleading one, of the ancient Idealism, that also was considered as disproved. Its name became a bonum vacans, and was assumed by the doctrine which reduced external objects to objective states of consciousness. Because Cartesianism thus led astray the true rationalistic tradition, and Kant, because of those complications in his system in which he delighted, was unable to influence the majority of minds, to-day naive Empiri- cism is the only standpoint of most educated men. Without criticism or hesitation, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, they make mere success their only standard, and do not see that such an apotheosis of practical ability is the bankruptcy of intellect. "The man who wishes to make a good and lasting work must be able to think, and to think correctly. What would become of civilisation, if political jobbers were our only statesmen, popularisers and mechanical inventors our only scientists, and ar- rangers of words, sounds, and letters our only artists? In failing to give thought its proper rank, Empiricism mutilates human nature, and thereby proves the nullity of the epistemology which produced it." Modern metaphysics has also come to grief on the problem of God and on that of human destiny. Here again the supposed classical proofs, both metaphysical and moral, which drew all their strength from tradition only, fell at the first blow of criti- cism, and left behind a void which nothing has filled. The meta- physics of nature is no better off. Philosophers have declined to construct it, and the failures of their predecessors justify their prudence. Scientists care nothing for it; and their 'theories' are but partial systems, which they themselves feel in duty bound to describe as conventional, symbolic, and purely arbitrary. Pure science is not open to attack; but it is only a repertory of terms. So we have no real theory, and no determinate orienta- tion which would allow us to hope for one. The origin of this evil is in the method of "clear and distinct" ideas, that is, in the substitution of the mathematical and me-</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, i910. 525 chanical ideal for the Platonic, Aristotelian and Thomistic method, which respected the qualitative differences of things. Excellent though it was as a foundation for the sciences, or at least for those sciences which do not deal with life, Cartesian mathematising made all really philosophical speculation im- possible. The prejudice in favor of universal mechanism, and the effort to maintain such a mechanism in its entirety, while merely superposing something else upon-it, have been the radical vices of all modern philosophy-vices from which neither Spinoza, nor Leibniz, in spite of his efforts towards dynamism, nor Kant, held fast by the logic of his presuppositions, were free.-The greater part of the book consists in a demonstration, partly historical, partly dogmatical, of this thesis.-It follows that the true metaphysical method is quite different; it should proceed qualitatively and by conceptual analysis. In every individual which exists and is an object for sensation there is a universal in re, which does not exist separately, which cannot be 'verified,' but which is nevertheless an object of knowledge. This universal can be thought only as it is apprehended in a particular object; one cannot think without an image. But, nevertheless, imaging is not thinking; to think is to affirm as true or as real that which one images, and such an affirmation is an act of the intellect distinct from representation pure and simple. It is metaphysical; but is also the most normal and common intellectual operation. Active minds are constantly making metaphysics without being aware of it. Only philosophers sometimes abstain from doing so, and that by a critical attitude which it is impossible to maintain for long. Every conception which is not purely nominalistic and symbolic is a partial synthesis of experience. Complete philosophy would be a synthesis of these syntheses, made by the same procedure; its real object, therefore, is nature, and not a transcendent something which exists 'in itself,' apart from and outside of nature. By adopting this standpoint, according to M. Dunan, we could found a metaphysic which would not be the brilliant but tran- sitory system of an individual, but a work of long and patient effort, admitting of collaboration and of continuous and pro-</page><page sequence="12">526 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. gressive advances. Such a return to the ancients should not mean the adoption of their system, but that of their admirably chosen method and categories, of the notions of idea and indi- vidual, form and matter. By the aid of these categories we should construct a complete conception of nature, homogeneous with the conceptions in actual use which facts of every order suggest to us. Science, history, the living tradition of mankind, and the religious experience of Christendom will furnish us precious materials which were lacking to the ancients; M. Dunan does not conceal the fact that he is a Catholic philosopher, and the spirit of Catholicism is very obvious in the background of his work. Such a total view will not be a certainty, but a probability subject to revision, and requiring the complement of faith. And just in the fact that it is this will consist its utility and its vitality. The passion for definitive certitude is an absurd and dangerous folly of youth, for philosophy as well as for individuals. It would be extremely unfortunate if, because they could not attain this puerile ideal, men should not try to attain any conception of life, its end and its value.' The reader will have noticed that much of this argument is open to question. For example, it admits, on the authority of certain physicists, doubtless of brilliant talents, but often and forcibly disavowed by their colleagues, that the ideal of science is analytic formulation in purely abstract terms, an algebraic nominalism the sole purpose of which is to supply the means of measuring and calculating phenomena in advance of their occur- rence, without in any way representing them. If all that lies beyond these narrow limits is to be called metaphysics, then nine-tenths of the physicists would energetically claim the right to be metaphysicians; and in doing so they would assert that they were not overstepping the boundaries of science, since they rightly define it by its demonstrative validity, by the free assent which it evokes in men's minds, and not by any particular shibboleth imposing this or that method upon it. In a very noteworthy lecture on the Brownian movement, delivered several 1 One can get an idea of the nature of this positive philosophy from the large text-book in philosophy which M. Dunan published several years ago, entitled Essais de philosophic generate.</page><page sequence="13">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 191o. 527 months ago, and published in the Bulletin de la Soci6te de Philos- ophie, M. Jean Perrin, professor of physics at the Sorbonne, showed how large a place is held in modern science by this same concrete mechanism which the abstractionists wish to expel from it. On this point, then, the documentary bases of M. Dunan's argument are shaky. The radical perceptionalism which he professes is more disconcerting, but perhaps, in the last analysis, better justified. He reverses the celebrated saying of Male- branche: " The sun which exists above us is invisible; that which we see is but a phantom created by our senses and our under- standing." For M. Dunan, on the contrary, the only Sirius which 'exists' is the brilliant point which seems to float in the air one hundred and fifty metres from me. Ens est quod per- cipitur. Such a view certainly makes little of the discordance between the perceptions of different minds. Is not existence precisely the objective value of a thought which is common to those minds? This is an obvious difficulty, which demands an answer. Yet it must be said that this perceptionalism, para- doxical as it may be, finds a place prepared for it by a tendency noticeable in France for several years. M. Bergson took an analogous position in his Matiere et memoir, and M. Binet in his L'dme et le corps. At present one often hears it said that " per- ception must be reinstated in the order of things." This thesis needs explanation, and doubtless correction as well; but it is certain that it represents an idea which is active at present. It is to be hoped that it may help towards a reform of our very unsatisfactory epistemology. For the rest, whatever objections may be raised to the con- clusions of Les deux idealismes, one must admire in the book the force and subtlety of a profoundly individual thinker, whose only aim is to satisfy the demands of his intellect and of his faith, and who never makes any concessions to popular tendencies and tastes. Thought produced by pure love of philosophy is itself a great philosophic 'value.' It should be added that M. Dunan is a writer as well as a thinker. More than one page of his book would deserve a place in an anthology of acute dicta for the clarity and precision, the life and the zest of its style.</page><page sequence="14">528 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. Why are there so many works in philosophy of which one could not say as much? II. I began this resume with metaphysical works, because of their dignity. But it must be admitted, in accordance with M. Dunan, that such works do not take the first place in the attention of the public at large, or even in that of the philosophical public. The questions chiefly discussed continue to be those which have to do with the normative sciences, and especially with the possibility of a rationalistic ethics and the conditions of moral education, whether during or after the time spent in school. Ethical societies, although they are not numerous in France, at least keep up an energetic propaganda. Almost every week the men who are occupied with philosophy, with education, or with teaching, receive invitations to attend or to take part in discus- sions of questions of this kind. The Union of Freethinkers and Freebelievers, the group which bears the name of the review Foi et vie, are friendly rivals in this field with the Union for Truth, the Ethical Section of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Sociales, the Positivistic Society, and the League for the Improvement of Public Morality. The discussion is not acrid, save on one point: the criticism of secularistic ethics by the defenders of Catholicism. In France, and in Belgium also, the sociological theories of morality, and the school manuals of laicised ethics, have been the objects of attacks which would be very interesting to us, if their talented authors had concerned themselves less with writers personally and more with their ideas. I will not undertake the analysis of these polemics, which lie outside of philosophy in too many ways. But within the limits of our proper subject, one of the most actively discussed questions continues to be that of the ends and means of moral education. The idea of an 'inde- pendent' ethics, once furthered by the admirable eloquence of Guyau, and which long seemed the only possible form of lay ethics, to-day has able adversaries. M. Delvolve, already known by his essay, L'organisation de la conscience morale, has just attacked this vital question in a work entitled Rationalisme et tradition, the real subject of which is better expressed by its</page><page sequence="15">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, i91o. 529 subtitle, Recherche des conditions d'efficacite d'une morale laique. Starting with the fact that however excellent a precept may be, it remains a dead letter for those who receive it from without, without any justification save abstract reasoning, he tries to determine, on historical and psychological grounds, what it is which must be added to normative judgments in order to make them rules efficacious in producing action. The result of his analysis is that ethical ideas, in order to exert real authority in practical life, must offer the following characteristics in as high a degree as is possible: (i) aptness to fuse with natural tendencies, that is, connection with an actual, strong and per- sistent form of spontaneous action; (2) an application which is general, and yet capable of being represented by a concrete intuition, since the abstract has no influence on conduct; (3) a great abundance of clear and stable elements, to facilitate atten- tion and memory; (4) numerous associations with those ideas which recur most frequently in ordinary life; (5) a systematic connection with a common centre, allowing them all to be em- braced in a single view. Most of these psychological conditions were well met by the traditional education in morals, which was expressed in immu- table religious formulas, connected with the existence and the will of God, personified in Jesus Christ, made an integral part of a complete organic view of life, and completed by the promise of rewards and the menace of future penalties. In the attempts at an independent ethics intended for school use, however, these conditions have been almost always disregarded. The anxiety to determine canons of morality and to justify them scientifically has made their authors forget that the thing of first importance was to make them potent and to express them in a form which would move the whole being. M. Delvolv6 proves this by a comparative analysis of Christian and laicised ethics under three heads of doctrine: marriage, suicide, philanthropy and charity. As examples of the Christian method of teaching he cites the Catholic Catechism, the Imitation of Jesus Christ, the Pensees of Pascal, Bourdaloue's sermons, the correspondence of St. Fran- cis de Sales, and Malebranche's Traite de morale; as examples of</page><page sequence="16">530 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XX. the laic method, the Morale a l'cole of M. Payot, the Le~ons de morale of MM. Rey and Dubus, the Etudes de morale positive of M. Belot, the Pour colee laique and the Devoirs of M. Jacob, and the Solidarite of M. Leon Bourgeois.' What does one see from this comparison? On the one side, few reasons are given, or none at all, but impulsive and inhibitory ideas, and motives well-adapted to bring about the realisation of the moral ideal, are brought effectively to a focus; on the other, there is ingenious reasoning, which is sometimes even profound and logically con- vincing, but the effect of which on consciousness is only super- ficial, and never sets in action the great energies of life. Here, much more than in theoretical difficulties, is the origin of what is to-day referred to in France as "the crisis in morals." But once the evil is recognised, it may be escaped. It is only necessary to give up the dangerous ideal of an ethics which is self-subsistent, independent of any metaphysical theory, "evi- dent as geometry," and demonstrating by irreproachable reason- ing the grandeur of duties both individual and social. We must, on the contrary, make ethics depend intimately on an idee-force, as M. Fouillee would say, and on the most powerful of such ideas to be found. It is not difficult to discover this idea, provided one knows the history of moral education, and examines without prejudice the resources of the human mind. MM. Leuba, Boutroux, Hebert, Murisier, and Montmorand have all taught us the unequalled power possessed by the sentiment of the divine. Here, as August Comte so justly believed, is a motive for action unique in its efficiency, and the only one which can supply what we are demanding from education. Up to this point believers applaud M. Delvolve, and invoke him, not without reason, as a witness to the powerful attraction which the religious ideal exerts on unprejudiced moralists. But he was not fighting for their party, since he rejects the orthodox form of this sentiment of the divine almost as energetically as the most 'advanced' partisans of an independent ethics. He does not even retain the most general characteristics of the Christian I M.

No more dualism, no more transcend- ence; the consciousness of the unity of all being, of the com- munity of all ends, and faith in their certain realisation-such is his own summary of the minimum of tradition which he would retain, and which he regards as sufficient to call into action the great energies of the human soul. Such a doctrine is well known outside of France; but until now it had scarcely any representa- tives here.' It is connected with the enthusiastic monism of Haeckel and M. Paul Carus, which has as its bases the sacredness of life, the morality of normal instincts, and the cultus of the complete development of the individual and the expansion of the species. Love in its double form, or rather in its double meaning, biological and sentimental, is the great impelling prin- ciple in this philosophy. The joy in life and in multiplying life are its fundamental sanctions. Of course, social feeling has a share in it, for who would think of eliminating it in our times? But it is clearly subordinate to the strictly vital impulse, the sentiment of universal optimism, and the faith that all of nature is good.-It may be interesting to recall that M. Delvolve is the son-in-law of Eugene Carriere, the painter-philosopher, "vision- ary of reality," whose fragments and letters he published some years ago, and to whom, as artist and as philosopher, Professor Seailles has just devoted a book of criticism.2 "Admiration of nature," wrote Carriere, "leads us to admire human nature, its conscious expression, and thus makes us comprehend that every- thing forbids us to degrade it." The inference, a logician might say, is somewhat bold, but however this may be, the passage- would be an excellent epigraph for the conclusions of M. Delvolv6. A more temperate work, and one more in harmony with the traditions of our philosophy, is that of M. Parodi, entitled 1 M. Andre Cresson, who expounded it in his Bases de la philosophic naturalists, (one volume I2mo, Alcan, I907), did so with a discretion which showed how little philosophical readers in France were accustomed to it. On this subject one may also consult the chapter entitled " Haeckel and Monism" in M. Boutroux's work Science et religion, (Flammarion, i909), analysed here last year. 2Eugene Carriere, Ecrits et lettres choisies, Ed. du Mercure de France, I907. G.

It is chiefly his- torical, and would be an excellent work to recommend to anyone who wished a general review of the various tendencies which have appeared among French writers on ethics during the past fifteen years. M. Parodi examines the biological type of ethics, as whose representative he chooses Dr. Metchnikoff, the socio- logical ethics of MM. Durkheim and Levy-Bruhl, the rationalis- tic, and at the same time social, ethics of MM. Belot and Landry, and the psychological ideo-motor ethics of M. Fouillee. He also mentions incidentally the ethical theories of Rauh, of Durand de Gros, and of Brochard. But M. Parodi does not restrict himself to an objective study of systems; he also draws his personal con- clusions in a chapter which bears the modest title "The Data of the Ethical Problem." I do not believe that one could find a clearer sketch of the attitude towards this problem taken by the rationalism which prevails in the teaching of our schools. Doubt- less, says M. Parodi, sociology is needed to instruct us and enable us to avoid utopias; but it is powerless to help us to a decision when we are really confronted by several possibilities. Then we must needs consult our conscience. But not every conscience is valid; only an enlightened and impartial conscience has any worth. Everybody admits this restriction; but what does it signify? Obviously that the impersonally rational has in some way a subsistence which is independent of individual minds, and has a value greater than their personal impulses. In all men, then, there exists a common higher nature which rules by right over the inferior nature. One must either deny the exist- ence of any moral problem whatever, or else admit this hierarchy. Even to begin to reflect on good and evil, is already to accept the legislative power of reason. In point of fact, however, has not reason almost always ap- peared in the history of philosophy as a destructive power? Stoicism ended in the praise of suicide and studied indifference to all the accidents, that is, to all the realities of life. Christianity issued even more definitely in hatred of nature and the flesh. Its rigorous practice would lead to absolute renunciation, strict chastity, and a suicide of the race. And modern rationalism</page><page sequence="19">No. 5.1 PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, ig9o. 533 is no less negative; conscience, reflection, the search for reasons, are mistresses of doubt, indecision, and inaction. There is a way out of this difficulty. Reins are a means to check a horse, not to make him go on. A rudder merely neu- tralises on one side the force of the wind or of the engine. Yet that does not prevent their being excellent as means of guidance. The same thing may be true of reason; the material for its guidance is not lacking. Without this material, which life alone supplies, the moral law would be merely an empty form, an abstract, ineffectual and useless principle. But once the ma- terial is given, reason governs and transforms it to a degree where it can no longer be recognised. The essence of morality consists entirely in this readiness to consider our spontaneous impulses from above and from without, objectively, and in relation to the legislation of reason. This inclination is a very real and efficacious one, for in beings such as we are, fashioned by all the discipline of science and of social life, "the need to think and to comprehend has become at times as profound and as irresistible as that to eat and drink." And so, even when it is reduced to the purely formal need of avoiding contradiction and incon- sistency, the moral sense remains a principle of action. It may be supported by other sentiments; but its specific character is always that same power of thinking in general and universal forms which is also the necessary condition of rational knowledge. "Thus," M. Parodi concludes, "moral action also involves an act of faith; but such an act is equally implicit in every activity whatsoever, in every effort towards the future, in every belief that tomorrow will go on where yesterday left cff, in a word, in all of life. Evidence and logical certainty, rigorously considered, apply only to what alr ady is or has been, and not to that which wills or which ought to be."-But this inevitable act of faith has to do with reason, and with reason only. We bel eve that our efforts have a meaning, that perhaps they will not be in vain. Thus we meet again the generous sperabimus of M. Fouillee, confidence in the effectiveness of our free action and n the value of human ideals, as the ultimate metaphysical postulate not only of morality but of all thinking and of all living.-And why</page><page sequence="20">534 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. should we not admit that this elementary belief, when given a profound interpretation is already religious, in the broader sense of the word? So at the end of the most 'laic' of books we unexpectedly meet again the same idea of religion with which this article began. Yet it seems to appear here in quite another meaning than that of M. J. J. Gourd. Religion here is no longer that which tran- scends reason, but reason itself, manifested in the laws which it sets for knowledge as well as for action. But possibly this opposi- tion is not so radical as it seems at first; for if the belief of which M. Parodi speaks is belief in reason, it is not a belief which is itself contained in reason and which enters into the coordination which it imposes on our conduct and our thought. It is the conditions of this labor of logical organisation, and consequently external to it, and on a different plane; it is not a product of the intellect, but rather the fundamental act by which the mind legitimates its attempt at a rational systematisation of knowledge and of action. Thus this belief really participates, for M. Parodi, in the character attributed by M. Gourd to the sublime and to sacrifice. To make use of an expression long out of fashion, but apparently now in favor again, one might say that this belief, also, belongs to the domain of the "au-deld." ANDREI LALANDE.
