Gregory Bateson In the early seventeenth Century collection of myths and rites from the area of Huarochiri south of Lima (hereafter referred to as huarochirí \ the mysterious goddess and huaca Chaupiñamca embodies the principie of betweenness 2. Yet she also resides within places and objects, in particular, this paper argues, the figure of a black llama as deep progenetrix and infuser of life in the Andean world. Chaupiñamca, despite representing the principie of betweenness, and representing the social cohesiveness of people and camelids as fertiüzing surplus, also inheres in particular places and things. She is, non-binarily associated with particularity, with indwellingness, and with transgression of boundaries, fertilization. The powers of threshold are hers as well as the powers of condensation. Because Chaupiñamca embodies betweenness and surplus, it makes sense for those chapters in huarochirí with Chaupiñamca in them not to focus on her, even * Hobart and William Smith Colleges, Geneva, New York.

Their words overflow with her, yet she " naturally " remains peripheral. No other major deity in huarochirí weaves so many possible kinship network as Chaupiñamca3, said to be the daughter of Tamtañamca and said also to be the daughter of the great Pariacaca. Chaupiñamca is represented as a singular being and as a collective sisterhood. She is deeply implicated in unspoken ritual practices and in belief Systems of protected obscurity. She escapes the confinement of a plot line resolved in any customary sense, although the unnamed marriageable female of the " plotted " Chapter V, featuring Huatyacuri, may be she. Her story slides through the webbing of language, of wordplay, of plot. Representation of her slips from sphere to sphere, as the narrative slips and skips from Chaupiñamca to one of her sisters, and from sister to brother to father ; and from site to site. The narrative of Chaupiñamca, connectress of semantic fields, conjoins action in the vegetable4, mineral, animal, human, and celestial realms. Chaupiñamca exercises median components of site, of descent, of " background ", of agriculture, of llama husbandry. Like Wiracocha, she is implicate in the arts of weaving, pottery, and astronomy5. As flowing as the Milky Way, also called the middle road or way, chawpi ñan 6, Chaupiñamca does not connect a to b. Rather, like the Milky Way, she pro vides moving perspectives on ways to see across fields of space that extend vertically and horizontally about pliant axes that olïer interfaces, as of cloth and earth, as of pot and produce, as of human being and llama. The dark constellation of the llama in the Milky Way, the sky river or kollur mayu of the Andes, offers another " deep " représentation of a " total " " cosmo logical project of sexual reproduction " 1. This dark or yana interstellar mother and child are associated with (alternâtes with ?) the Pleiades, the mother of the stars. Indeed, the sky llama is a major organizational schéma behind many of the rites and myths spoken of in huarochirí, as is her counterpart, Chaupiñamca. Silverman-Proust identifies the motif ñan (" road ") in weaving as mayu (" river ") and also as sonqocha or heart blood (29). The river-road concept appears as a motif in weaving, as a component of seeing, as the river road of the Milky Way, as Walking, and is connected to lakes8. Almeida de Oña also points out that the word for eyes has an etymological connection with the word for road, and that both are connected to the way in Quechua the future is made out by looking at the past. To see ahead, one looks behind. If so, not only perceiving and feeling, but telling time " middle roads " 9. Prominent among chaupi's meanings is " middle Her name suggests intra mundial connections : chawpi : " Mitad, o el medio de cosas o lugares o tiempo, o obra "10 : the middle of things, or of places, or of time, or of work n, or of the heart in the middle. As Chawpi or the Milky Way articulâtes a middle way, and as the instep, chaupi, articulâtes the foot, so does Chaupiñamca enact the betweening powers of the combinatory. She interconnects semantic fields as apparently disparate as the organized mingling of macro- and micro-ethnic groups12, of weaving with disparate colors, of Walking between places, of cultivation of coca with its ritual overtones, of llama racing with its ritual overtones, and so on. In some aspects, the betweening capabilities of Chaupiñamca resemble</page><page sequence="3">CHAUPIÑAMCA OF HUAROCfflRÍ 33 Derrida's points concerning " Hymen : inter Platonem et Mallarmatum " 13, as when Derrida situâtes excess (surplus) in the syntactic, and as when he notes that The word " between " has no füll meaning of its own. Inter acting forms a syntactical plug; not a categorem, but a syncategorem : what philosophers from the Middle Ages to Husserl's Logical Investigations have called an incomplète signification. (221) Interestingly pertinent also in this context is a Derridean spéculation on etymology. " Rightly or wrongly, the etymology of'hymen' is often traced... [to 'to sew' and to 'tissue']... Hymen might then mean a little stitch.... Both words would have a relation with... [to weave, spin — the spider web — machinate, textile, net, text, weaving of a song, a sort of textile] " (213). Of course (presumably), the phenomenological associative Cluster with betweenness in either the Greek or the Quechua-Aru-Puquina language world comes from lived experience, rather than an etymological connection. Andeans weave their fields, both in the sense that their fields were (and often still are) woven into their textiles, and in the sense that their fields were (and sometimes still are) themselves woven like textiles. The rights of use of territory (and/or the Organization of space around a river-like center, Harris illustration 320, fig. 14.6), Unes of kinship, ritual patterns, earthtexts with ritual significance, and cosmic texts 14 are spun continuously if always incompletely amidst that complex, multi-dimensional, multiply locative weaving of huarochiri. The preceding suggests some of the ways Chaupifiamca's narrative illustrâtes Bateson's sense of " story " as a form that does not isolate human beings as "... separate from the starfish and the sea anemones... Rather, if the world be connected, if I am at ail fundamentally right in what I am saying, then thinking in terms of stories must be shared by ail mind or minds, whether ours or those of redwood forests and sea anemones " 15. Chaupifiamca of huarochiri is shared by various peoples as a mother and shared as a wanton woman. Priests find her as a lying and insatiable lover, and Chaupifiamca's " story " touches on the huaca that, in ancient times, walked the earth in human form and slept with priests who could not satisfy her (196-197, 11. 19-22). Men whose penises were too small prayed on the highest mountain of Marna for larger penises to satisfy Chaupifiamca, although only Rucanacoto, who had a large penis, completely satisfied her. When people sought counsel of Chaupifiamca, she consulted her sisters. Her cuit was celebrated for five days in June by célébrants who, if they owned llamas, danced in puma skins 16. If they owned no llamas, they danced without puma skins. When they danced the Casayaco naked, Chaupifiamca especially enjoyed the ceremony and the epoch was one of great fertility. Chaupifiamca is also associated with earth in other ways, such as her manifestation as a five-armed rock (195, 1. 12). She partakes of the world of the dead and she partakes of the world of livestock; her yanca (priest-astronomers) sacrifice llama hearts (181, 1. 73) and guinea pigs to predict fertility. All these manifestations are components of a " story " not restricted to human protagonists nor confined to a plot line 17. In contrast, an informant from the historie and plotted context, Don Cristóbal Choquecaxa, plays a human role in the text of huarochiri that he helped compile.</page><page sequence="4">34 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES Although half Christianized, he offers an insight into Andean, pre-colonial " middle " space (Chapter 21). One side of the painted icon-huaca or idol that swirls around Don Cristóbal in his nightmare bears the image of a small black démon with eyes like silver. The huaca wears the figure of a llama on its head. Above that llama headpiece, yet another small black démon, with yet another llama on its head is topped by yet a third démon and llama tier. That Don Cristóbal should dream of three, interconnected, totemic images resonates with the sacred llama's multiple locations. The triplicity of the image rising tier upon tier in Cristobal's nightmare indicates the interconnectedness of différent spheres. The same interconnectedness may be exemplified by Andean weavers when they speak of a third design, an invisible one, between the two visible sides of a weaving. Between the planes of visible woven symmetries exists an invisible design in a lightless light between the world above and the world below, the pattern above and the pattern below. There in the dark is space for generative constellation. The weaving in between the two visible sides créâtes a third space of gestation, a " generative " hole such as those of which Martínez speaks, when he describes a differential séparation or uterine configuration, brought about by the figurative opposition between a huaca from on high and a huaca from below 18. The late, lamented Martha Anders used to lecture on a vase discovered in Chincha, not far south of Pachacamac. (Pachacamac is a center of worship that forms one end of the zone of Huarochiri, once a major route between the coast and Cusco. Huarochiri itself could be considered " chaupi " : a midline or a space between, a " syncategorem ".) Anders believed her site in Chincha Baja could prove to be a temple to earth mother, Pacha Mama, a temple possibly of Wari origin. The three tiered vase she displayed contains two black llamas painted on the bottom register. The black llamas at the base of the vase suggest a black llama huaca as the " llama below ". The llama has long been associated with women 19, but these black, Pacha Mama-associated Hamas at the base of the vase evoke the dark, llama-mother constellation in the skies above. Some scholars believe the shape of the city of ancient Cusco may have conformed to the shape of a llama20. The llama-shaped, sacred city resting on the surface of this earth, Kay Pacha, can be seen as an extension of the dark constellation of the llama, the huaca in the sky above. If so, Cusco itself would then be a Kay Pacha Catachillay, another llama figure or genotype on " this earth ". Cristóbal de Molina présents the llama as a double or manifestation of the Inca, but the llama Molina is concerned with is white and maie. Curiously enough, Molina misses the implication of the story of the emergence of Andean peoples as being coincident with and perhaps emerging from, the camelid : " No living things survived [the flood] except a man and a woman who reamined in a box, and when the waters subsided, the wind carried them to Huanaco " 21. " Huanaco " gives Markham trouble and he corrects to " Tia-huanacu " (note 3). The term, Huanaco, or guanaco, a camelid relative of the llama embedded in the name of the place of origin, " Tiahuanacu ", gives another Molina editor problems as well : "Sobre el antiguo Tiahuanaco (Tierra huanaco, dice el manuscrito, seguramente por error de copia), ... "22. Neither Markham ñor</page><page sequence="5">CHAUPIÑAMCA OF HUAROCHIRÍ 35 Morales translates the most obvious meaning for Huanaco, guanaco, the camelid relative of the llama and the alpaca. It seems probable that llamas and alpacas did give birth to the Andean peoples and civilizations. The late, lamented Robert Randall argued that Wiracocha, god of the universe, was seen as an alpaca 23. My view of Wiracocha is that above all the deity represents the principie of roundness, of a total system of cyclic completion24. In huarochirí, the originally androgynous Wiracocha manifests himself as masculine. In huarochirí, Chaupiñamca would be the correspondent feminine fertilizing principie. The Inca civilization spun a myth of their emergence that is cognate to the Tiahuanaco myth : " At the same instant Manco Ccapac and his brothers and sisters, by command of the Creator, descended under the earth and carne out again in the cave of Paccaritambo [n.7 : " Near Cuzco. From Paccari, the dawn, and tompu, an inn "], though they say that other nations came out of the same cave, at the point where the Sun rose on the first day after the Creator had divided the night from the day " (Molina, 6). Once again, curiously enough, although the Incas issue from " the cave of Paccaritambo ", Molina does not entertain a very probable connection between the dawning of human beings and the male llama, pago, a connection Randall argues for 25. There are myths of emergence that name or suggest the llama. There are the black llamas at the base of the vase from a sea coast site. There are llama-shaped towns and cities between coast and Cusco. The figure of the llama connects the earth below and the sky, both semantically and syntactically. The figure indicates not only a profound connectedness in space and shape, traversing ecological zones and boundaries, but also a hologram, figured by an image of multiple represen tational properties : llama of many places, above, below, between ; white male llama Inca ; black Pacha Mama llama. The concept of triplicity, or of multiple locations, each one simultaneously embodying the others, appears also in hanan pacha, kay pacha, urin pacha, translated as Earth Above, This Earth, Earth Below. Duviols has argued that Andean créatures have celestial prototypes that are receptables of the spirit (134), shadowy creators criador sombra, "prototype céleste", " ... camac, c'est-à-dire la force qui anime, selon Garcilaso... " (136) 26. This stratification of llama endotype configuration bears close affinities to différent Andean peoples and différent Andean places or zones. Although the phenomenon is like doubling, the relationship is less of first and copies, than of generative coupling of similar figures across space and in spacial interstices. Moreover, wherever there are three figures, the gestalt suggests an infinite kinetic interchange, rather than an original type followed by seconds or copies (the Platonic model). The llamas above, and on " our " ecological level, and below our ecological level, and beneath us, as in the graves uncovered by the archeologists, speak less of location than of loci. That is, they speak of moving relations ; of genealogies divine and mundane. As loci, figures provide streams of relations that eut through the planes of place. No only do the llamas move ; each suggests the others, a reminder of Martinez's description of the difîerential séparation or uterine configuration brought about by the figurative opposition between a huaca from on high and a huaca from below.</page><page sequence="6">36 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES A uterine stream may provide the key to transformations in those sections of huarochirí that pertain to Chaupiñamca. If she signifies a uterine configuration, if she lies between a huaca on high and a huaca below, and if Chaupi[the one between]ñamca is also a llama-huaca, with sacred place and priests, because she is the " one between she generates invisibly. And yet ritual observances to her are essential to understanding design generally. When a mind trained in binary relations images a figure, that figure emerges in contrast to the ground. When the shift in perception occurs in the gestalt, the ground becomes the figure, and the previous figure becomes the more or less undiscerned [backjground. One sees, in the rabbit/duck configuration, either the rabbit or the duck. But in the Andean context this paper describes, the figure is the llama and the ground is another llama. And there is a third llama where a binary mind would place the vergule : figure-slash-ground. In huarochirí, perception of figure/ground does not shift back and forth between llama and llama. The slash opens yet another llama space within llama and llama. Where a mind cast in habits of binary thought will shift from one design to the other, as if turning the weaving over to see first one side, and then the reverse side, seen as différent, the Andean mind holds three designs in mind, sees the river-road or the dark road Chaupiñamca (and also ñamca means " black ") : road between the banks, the unseen design in the middle, the llama-llama-llama as generative process. The rainy season begins with the dark llama constellation urinating : the dark llama constellation must drink from the horizon in October or there will be a flood27. These generative waters do not issue from an outside, however. The embodied cosmos holds that urine in a within. Rain emerges from the inside of a dark figure in the heavens of many other concrete insides. There are no flat exteriors. Living spaces with insides and outsides, undersides and backsides cross the skies. I would go so far as to maintain that, for the archaic Andean, there is no outside, unless that outside also is possessed of an inside and is itself inside something eise that is relatively correspondent. The obverse is also true. The Andean sense of interiority is differently situated than a Western sense of it. Interiority not only can be, but is sought for outside oneself. The sky or high llama in earth above (Hanan Pacha), is called the llama Ñahui or Ñawi28. Ñawi means " eyes " in Quechua. Urton identifies the eyes of the llama, Llamacñawin, as Alpha and Beta Centauri29. The constellation of the llama is also called Catachillay, as is the Southern Cross30, in that phénoménal " reproducing " across space already noted. The sky llama is Catachillay, Yacana, Ñahui, and may even symbiotically be the Pleiades as well. " The Pleiades had the name catachillay in common with A and B Centauri. Both constellations had the attribute of 'carrying along' " (Zuidema : 225). Ñawi : " eyes " ; ñawpa : the past and the future, what lies before, what comes after : the aggregate of meanings indícate the connection between road ñon, eyes ñawi, and the past-and-future, ñawpa31. On earth (Kay Pacha), the llama figure is ail but ubiquitous. It appears directly figured in many stone amuléis, illas, for instance. It appears obliquely through association. Like the bright eyes of the dark sky llama, lakes are the eyes of dark</page><page sequence="7">CHAUPIÑAMCA OF HUAROCHIRÍ 37 earth, the lake motif that appears in Andean weavings in a rhomboid figure referred to as ñawi (eyes)32, that is, in the eye symbol that evokes the bright eyes of the dark llama in the sky constellation. Icons, llamas, lakes, and eyes contain similarities not apparent to the uninitiated. But when contextualized, the simila rities are difficult to miss. The preceding suggests some of the metaphorical web needed to configure Chaupiñamca, the female protagonist and guardián deity featured by ñame in chapters 9, 10, and 13 of huarochirí. In these chapters devoted to her, " her " tale remains steadfastly untold ; indirection reaches its apogee. Instead, objects in the " connected world " speak of and for her. As noted, she may be the unnamed, anthropomorphic protagonist in Chapter 5 of huarochirí but that is as close to a plotted narrative as Chaupiñamca comes. Even the ancient Bolivian Aymara saw the sky in ways that correspond to the multiply located and betweening llama of huarochirí. The polysemous word wari means vicuña, a camelid like a llama, in Aymara. The vicuña constellation in the sky is named Wari33. " Wari " refers also to an entire culture, an earth space-time. " Wari " also refers to an underground démon. So, like Chaupiñamca, Wari invokes multiple référencés, from above to below, and a Cluster of associations that range from blessed to demonic. And, like Wari, Chaupiñamca also invokes the earth space and time of a particular people. Orgiastic Chaupiñamca evokes the savage female underground démon, counterpart to the maie underground démon, Wari, yet also counterpart to a celestial camelid. For in potentia, she is omniprésent, although more seeing than seen. " In the names of each of these holy places, holy men, sacred objects, huacas, the term ñamca abounded ", the text of huarochirí confides in an aside (Chapter 13, 234-235, 1. 51). Ñamca means astronomers34, students of the dark. Since, as Almeida de Oña points out, it is " a widely known fact " that Ñ, Ll, and Y are interchangeable in Quechua, ñamca, llamka, yamka, and yañca could ail infer astronomers or ñamca 35. Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino avers that the " a " used sometimes to be dropped36, so that llamka could once have been llama-ka, ñamca : ñama-ca : llamastro-nomers, llama priests, and the llama goddess, all of them the eyes of roads, eyes in the sky, eyes on the sky, roads to determine the way of the llama37. Interesting also are the possible meanings of ñamca and Chuapiñamca's connection with llama sacrifice and llama fertility rites38. Llama sacrifice is deeply involved in the fertility cuit to that primordial agro-astral goddess, Chaupiñam ca39. The connection of sacrifice with women's reproductive beliefs and rituals suggest yet other, secret or invisible connections to the llama constellation above, and to the primordial huaca before-and-behind, and the huaca below, the great oceanside site of Pachacamac. Not only does Chaupiñamca occupy multiple locations in intermeshed space, but in the text itself, she moves from place to place ; she moves from marginal or semi-manifestation to marginal manifestation, from interstice to interstice, from recounting of one llama ritual or tale to the next. It is as if, in the chapters said to be about her in which she so peripherally appears, principies of fecund</page><page sequence="8">38 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES femininity are shown with averted attention, whereas principies of seminal masculinity accentuate historical, cosmological, and/or geographica! events. (Although this Statement may seem sexist to some, nevertheless, the textual evidence supports principies of femininity as dispersive, as contrasted to accentuai. This is not at ail the same as to say they are passive, for they are not). Although this paper does not base its interprétation of Chaupiñamca's " narrative " primarily on etymological or linguistic grounds, but on semantic, syntactic, and symbolic interconnections, linguistics supports rather than contra dicts the interprétation I stand in the middle of. The Cluster of associations in Chaupiñamca's Aru-Puquina-Quechua-Aymara name as in her narrative meande ring suggest that the huaca Chaupiñamca connects the middle llama to an originary black llama, a night llama or dark constellation that appears as Yacana in the 29th chapter of huarochiri. Yacana, the constellation of the dark llama, the source of vital force, walks with her offspring in the midst of a river of stars. They are growing darker (chapter 29, 424-425, 1. 6)40. The darkening the text mentions suggests that, to the Andean, the time on earth of human kind that began with a wound in the black llamastronomer night may corne to an end in a llama blacker than the primordial mother. ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE NAME CHAUPIÑAMCA According to other contemporary documents, that nomina confusa, ñamca, corresponds to ñamocc and to Namoc or Ñamoc 41. Ñamoc is a variant of Llamoc. Ail the ñamca are offshoots of the primordial huacas, Yanañamca (possibly Albornoz's Tantanamoc) and Tutañamca. Huarochiri begins with mention of these progenitive huacas, Yanañamca Tutañamca-dark night ñamca " Yanañamca " ; wounded night ñamca " Tutañamca ", offshoots of the darkness and night of origin and of ending, as well as of generative, uterine dispersai or " surplus ". Mario Mejía Waman translated the ñamca of Yanañamca straight away as " llama, black llama " 42. Although ñamca appears in no Quechua or Aymara dictionary I have consulted, llamea and yamka appear in a Valcárcel appendix (388). Seeing that " ñ ", " 11 ", and " y " are interchangeable, ñamca can be llamea. As noted, Valcárcel defines llamea, llank'i as greda or fuller's earth, or absorbent clay. Secondly, he defines illamaca ; llamake ? ñamca puede ser elemento unido a la divinidad ; tiene greda : ñamca is a divine element associated with a highly absorbent clay. Since, moreover, when " -ca " is used as a suffix, it is possible an " a " has been dropped. Ñamca could have been ñamaca or Hamaca. If the mysterious ñamca so important in huarochiri is a version of llama-ca 43, then we have a pattern congruent with much eise in the ancient Andes. Even the connection with clay recalls the vase found at Chincha Baja, a site where surely the art of pottery as well as the art of weaving and the art of agronomy were ail practised. Cristóbal de Molina defines llanca as a working llama. As a shadow self, the llama recalls the llamas buried at the foot of the body, as in the Lord of Sipan burial site. Zuidema notes the wordplay associated with the two stars that are the llama eyes or ñawi : Catachillay and Unuchilla. (Catachillay, you will remember, is both</page><page sequence="9">CHAUPIÑAMCA OF HUAROCHIRÍ 39 the ñame of the llamashape of the ancient city of Cusco and of the llama constellation, as is Yacana) : Cata, or cati, occurs in both Quechua and Aymara as a root of words with similar meanings, such as " dragging over the ground " following him/her who goes ahead " dragging, leading (a llama ?) with a rope The Aymara words catari (" viper ") and havira cata (" the bed [in Spanish " mother "] of the river ") are probably based on this root. Given that Urcochillay is a male llama star and Unuchilla a young llama star, we can see that cata is an attribute that the mother llama star has in common with Pachamama, the Earthmother. Another ñame of Pachamama, again in both Quechua and Aymara, is Suyrumamam, " mother with the long dress that drags (over the ground or through the mud) In harvest rituals, women would imítate Pachamama, Walking about with just such a long dress. When the Quechua poem addresses the Virgin as catachillay, it is probably using " dragging ", " carrying " as a common characterictic of female deities. The meaning of the term unuchilla gives us an additional reason why the celestial llama was given such a ñame. From the Aymara root unu are derived the following terms : unuqueatha to move unuqueña movement llampuna unuqueñapa the movement of the sky. (224) In chapter 13 44, Chaupiñamca's tale is begun again or taken up again, but the detailing differs : the narrator says : it is said that, in very ancient times, a huaca from above married the sun and bore two children, Pariacaca and Chaupiñamca. Pariacaca gives vitality to men ; and, coincident with the festivities of Corpus Christi, Chaupiñamca gives vitality to women. Again, reference is made to licentiousness and excess in her rituals ; much chicha is drunk ; many guinea pigs and llamas sacrificed. Llamas are sacrificed. Chaupiñamca's sister Cassallacsa (or the people who worshipped Cassallacsa), or Llacsahuato, Mirahuato (198-199,11. 27-28 ; 224-225,1. 12 ; 230-231,1. 35), was also widely worshipped. She could have been one of Chaupiñamca's Others ; the five sisters suggest an alliance of women huacas as well as a counterpart of the Pleiades on earth45. To avoid problems, the text advises : whenever a person consults one of these huacas, the custom is to greet the huaca : " 'All hail, five Ñamca' " (236-237,1. 52). Moreover, every Community offers its own version of her tale, of her ñames, and whether or not she was Tamtañamca's daughter. And so it is that no one can swear to anything, where Chaupiñamca is concerned. For when questioned, with no regard for the truth, Chaupiñamca would answer any oíd thing. To tell the truth, the text says, Chaupiñamca lied (230-231). In the following passage, nuna seems coextensive with ñan. The informant instinctively connected the huayno (song : way nuna, the song of the spirit) to the path of the spirit. What we commonly cali the waynu, our taki (song and dance) is really the way nuna ; it is the song and expression of our soul, our spirit and our being. It is the song of love ; performing these verses we dance and sing in tears, and measure them against our instruments... The good waynu is one composed by a woman ; only they can compose well. The way nuna should reveal our deep and honest love. Love, honest love, is the wanting, the desire and disposition of our creator, so that in the way nuna our being speaks through God's desire 46. The connection, you may say, between nuna and ñan is oblique. Although oblique, it is as associatively direct as the connection between the animais called the</page><page sequence="10">40 SOCIÉTÉ DES AMÉRICANISTES llama-people that are llamas (runa llama)41. It is as associatively direct as the connection between the llama-people that are people, their lives and the lives of llamas conjoined, and so they too are called llama people 48. Briggs recalls seeing, some twenty years ago in a muséum in Oruro, Bolivia, a series showing the progression of a llama turning into a person, the last showing the llama nostrils parted to reveal the eye holes of a human skull49, another associative Cluster of perception (the eye holes) and inter-relatedness. Guillermo Delgado-P. writes, " Indeed, there is no better early evidence of the llama's association with the religious sphere than the rock paintings of Cala-Cala near Oruro (Bolivia)..., La Quiaca (Argentina), and la Sierra de Arica (Chile), ...or of the stone llama sculptures of Belén of Andamarca (Bolivia) ... These reveal that the llama had captured the imagination of early populations and was consequently becoming an important character of the Andean theogony. In Cala-Cala, rock paintings reveal heards of brown-coloured llamas, with a whitish llama pronely outstanding. Immediately above it a puma — Felix concolor — seems to be in a hunting pose50 ". Finally, very apropos to this context, Dedenbach-Salazar-Sáenz points out that, in the third chapter of huarochiri, in which a llama saves the herder from the flood, the grammar of human reference is used for the llama (llama-ca, p. 74,1. 4)51 ; the llama uses human language. So there is text-specific as well as pan-Andean evidence of llama-people such as Chaupiñamca, of llama runakti. What can it mean, to be situated simultaneously in many points in space and time, and be between them ? " Space is always dynamic ", Lawrence Sullivan argues. " The significance of space is disclosed by the acts that take place there... Trails are esteemed because they are the loci of sacred events "52. Still, the dynamism of roads and words and reproduction may not communicate the spatial depth of the Andean world. Reichel-Dolmatoff, speaking of another people, but a people not far in place from the Quechua, graphically renders sacred female space. The wider cosmic image is this : the isomorphic chain formed by the human brain, the longhouse, and the hills continues in the celestial vault. This, too, is an immense brain ; the Milky Way is the great fissure which separates the two hemispheres and is called trail of the Master of Animais, because the constellations and ail others stars are the animais and people, the butterflies and flowers which occupy the brain compartments. In another image, the Milky Way and its swaying motion represent the same two intertwined serpents : the female anaconda and the maie rainbow boa. Beyond the Milky Way lies space, and cosmic space is said to be a womb ; it is called..., an expression that can be glossed as " time-seat-abdominal-cavity ". This cosmic womb is a limitless hexagonal rock crystal. The entire chain, from the cosmic crystal to the human brain, is linked together by a steady flow of solar energy (boga) which forms a line of conduction that puisâtes in synchronization with the human heartbeat. In this way, the material and the immaterial world corne to constitute a single whole 53.

The Frank Salomon and George L. Urioste translation into English of the myth-histories and taies of Huarochiri is being published by the University of Texas Press at Austin in 1991 as The Huarochiri Manuscript. The Gerald Taylor translation into Spanish, Ritos y tradiciones de Huarochiri del siglo xvii (Lima : IEP, 1987), the édition I have drawn on most for this paper, is hereafter referred to as huarochiri. 2. Chaupiñamca is a manifestation of Pacha Mama, the earth goddess of the Andes. 3. Richard Schaedel argues the Organization of " supra- " or mixed or interrelated communities as early as 500 B.C. : " There is a strong likelihood that etnias of comparable scale occupied the chaupiyunga above and behind these coastal groups and probably extending up to the Pacific watershed", " Coast-Highland Interrelationships and Ethnie Groups in Northern Peru (500 B. C. - A. D. 1480) ", in Andean Ecology and Civilization, ed. Shozo Masuda, Izumi Shimada, and Craig Morris (Tokyo : University of Tokyo Press, 1985), 443-474 ; 445 ; hereafter cited as Andean Ecology and Civilization. Such interrelationships existed in Southern Peru as well. 4. For Chaupiñamca's connection to the potato, as well as some of her calendraic connections, see Miriam Chiu and Karen Lizárraga, La Papa : Símbolo Andino de Vida (Lima : Museo Nacional de Antropología y Arqueología, 1989), passim. 5. Iiiana Almeida de Oña, reflecting on one meaning of " llamea " as " greda ", potter's clay, said : " para la cerámica. Para hacer los illas, los ídolos que se entierra para la fertilidad The clay is used to make the small idols so fequently in the shape of llamas buried for the sake of fertility. Interview, February 1990 ; hereafter cited as Almeida de Oña. The sacrifice of the illa is reminiscent of Luis Valcárcel, Historia del Perú Antiguo, Tomo III (Lima : Editorial Juan Mejía Baca, 1964) : " llama huacay llama wagay, grito de llama llama wak-ay el ídolo de llama " (587) : the figure of the idol huaca is associated with the cry of the llama at sacrifice. Hereafter cited as Valcárcel. 6. Gail Silverman-Proust's informant, speaking of the vertical line in a weaving, draws naturally on a complex of meaning that connects road and middle in a single, agricultural-astronomical gestalt : " Respuesta : « 'Chawpin sutinqa flan' ». ('El centro se llama el camino'), " 32 of " Tawa Inti Kocha, símbolo de la cosmología andina ", Anthropologica, 6 (Lima : Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, 1988), 7-65 ; hereafter cited as Silverman-Proust. 7. Marshall Sahlins' contention : " The universe is a genealogy, which is to say a total cosmological project of sexual reproduction ", Islands of History (Chicago and London : The University of Chicago Press, 1985), 13. 8. María Rostworowsky writes, " Entre los diseños más significativos de los tejidos Charazani se encuentra el símbolo Nawi (ojo), representado por un rombo del que, a la manera de un sol, parten rayos... Esta figura es similar a la que se presenta en los chumpis de Huancavé [sic.jlica estudiados por G. Sayán que correspondería a Cocha (laguna), Estructuras andinas del poder (Lima : IEP, 1983), 123. 9.

In an etymology of Chaupi, Concepción González del Río and Karen Lizárraga note that " También la raíz chau significa algo no concluido, a mitad del proceso en su parte mejor, dando la noción de chaupiñamca como la mitad del camino, el momento cumbre del trayecto " Astronomía, Mitología y normas : Dioses y hombres de Huarochiri ", in Renacimiento Andino (Lima : Museo Nacional de Antropología y Arqueología, 1988), 20. That being so, embedded in Chaupiñamca's ñame is a principie of the incomplète, the always-in-process, a rich conception. 12.

Aveni and Gary Urton (New York : the New York Academy of Sciences), 231-248, connects Chaupiñamca to the Pleiades, 242. 17. The word " story " appears in quotation marks to indícate a point of contention. Father Walter Ong argues " primitive " peoples did not tell stories ; they were in a " pre-narrative " State. " In fact, an oral culture has no experience of a lengthy, epic-size, or novel-size climactic linear plot, ñor can it imagine such Organization of lengthy material. In fact, it cannot organize even shorter narrative in the highly climactic way that readers of literature for the past 200 years have learned more and more to expect. It hardly does justice to oral composition to describe it as varying from an Organization it does not know, and cannot conceive of. The 'things' that the action is supposed to start in the middle of have never, except for brief passages, in anyone's experience been ranged in a chronological order to establish a 'plot'. There is no res, in the sense of linear plot to start in the middle of. The res is a construct of literacy. It has to be made, fictionalized, and it cannot be made before writing. You do not find climactic linear plots ready formed in people's lives, although real lives may provide material out of which such a plot may be constructed " (15). But Merleau-Ponty's point of view in respect to " story " seems infinitely more informative in this context : " ...the notion of response separates into 'geographical behavior' — the sum of the movements actually executed by the animais in their objective relation with the physical world ; and behavior properly so called — these same movements considered in their internai articulation and as a kinetic melody gifted with a meaning " (130). Thus Merleau-Ponty implies that an anthropocen trically " evolved " chronological order means disconnecting culture and nature and sacrificing " kinetic melody" : The Structure of Behavior, trans. Alden L. Fisher (Boston : Beacon Press, 1963). 18.

An especially interesting analysis of this connection is Denise Arnold's " You are what you eat : incest beliefs and potato cultivation among the Aymara of Highland Bolivia presented at the 46th Congress of Americanists, July 5, 1988 : " The wrapping of the potato in its earth placenta during its gestation period in darkness, is also comparable to the custom of wrapping a newly born baby in woven cloth during its first three months of life, when it is shrouded in darkness and only gradually accustomed to the light of day, and woven cloth is also used to wrap the corpses of the newly dead in their return to the darkness of the underworld " 17 ; the cycle describes includes marking the ears of llamas to indícate menstrual blood. This quotation shows how concretely interconnected weaving and women, planting and burying, harvesting and bearing of plants and animais are. 20.

Karen Spalding, in Huarochirí an indean society under Inca and Spanish rule (Stanford, California : Stanford University Press, 1984), says that the first language of Huarochirí was yañca : n. 67, 312 " Avila, Dioses y hombres de Huarochirí 65, 79, 103. The ñame yañca was " clearly specific to Huarochirí, whose population did not speak Quechua as a first language ; the function of the priests of the wak'as, équivalent to the yañca, is also described by Arriaga ", 32-33. The yccñcas were also priests ; see the chapter, " The Sons of Pariacaca ", 65. Hereafter cited as Spalding. 36. Interview, April, 1990. 37. William Sullivan, personal communication of July, 1991, and in his dissertation, spoke of " ñan... used in precolumbian times to refer to the Milky Way (though far less frequently than mayu) " and that " in both Cobo's and Molina's version of the Cañad origin myth, the sacred mountain that survived the 'flood' was huascayñan, literally " llama road ". Holguin lists huacayhua for cargo llama, and Guamán Poma renders llama as huacay 38. Valcárcel : "llamatanacani : llamata ñak'ani, degüello a la llama", 587 : Yacana, Chacana, llamatanacani : do these echoing terms suggest one complex ? 39. Spalding provides a lenghty description of Chaupiñamca as a fertility deity : " But whatever the political ramifications of her genealogy, Chaupiñamca was the fertility deity worshiped at harvest time and consulted by people throughout the región in cases of personal trouble. Her worship probably coincided with the solstice, for the narrator of the tales of Huarochirí remarked that after the Spanish conquest, her festival was hidden by associating it with the Corpus Christi feast in June. The ceremonies described by Huaman Poma de Ayala for the équivalent month were festivals that celebrated the end of hunger throughout the four quarters of Tawantinsuyu — the month called Inti Raymi quilla. 'In this month they offered painted llamas to the wak'as throughout the kingdom, and in this there was a great deal of ceremony and the Inca had a great festival inviting all the great lords and principales and the other leaders and the poor Indians, and they ate and sang and danced in the public square... This month the food is ripe and thus the people ate and drank and feasted at the cost of the Inca, and this month the birds of the sky and the rats [cuyes ?] have enough to eat' " (98). 40. Gary Urton identifies " Chacana ", " puente " or " bridge " with Orion's belt. Nevertheless, the acoustic résonance of Chacana to Yacana suggests kinship of constellation. 41.
