<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE XINGDE ffljfg TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI Marc Kalinowski translated by Phyllis Brooks The discovery of the Mawangdui tomb no. 3 manuscripts at the beginning of the 1970's was an event of great significance for ancient Chinese historical studies. Since the first transcriptions appeared, these authentic testimonies to the culture of China at the beginning of the Former Han dynasty (206 b.c.-a.d. 8) have been the focus of scholarly interest. Even though a considerable amount of work has already been carried out, we still await a complete edition of the manuscripts. The First International Conference on the Mawangdui Tombs, held in Changsha, Hunan, in August of 1992, marked a step towards the comple tion of such a project. On that occasion the authorities at the Hunan Provincial Museum exhibited the most representative artifacts from the three Mawangdui tombs and several of the silk manuscripts from tomb no. 3 were placed at the disposal of the participants.1 In addition, the conference coincided with the publication of Mawangdui Hanmu zvenwu (Cultural relics unearthed from the Han tombs at Ma wangdui; hereafter, Hanmu wenwu), a magnificent work of art that includes reproductions of several unpublished manuscripts, among them copy B of the Xingde JflJUi (Punishment and Virtue) texts studied in this article.2 The reproductions of Xingde B are accompanied by a 1. It was as a conference participant that I was able to see several originals of the manuscripts studied in this article. However, my research relies principally on texts that either have been published or that have been described by those in charge of the conservation and editing of the manuscipts. For a general discussion of Mawangdui manuscripts, see Jeffrey K. Riegel, "A Summary of Some Recent Wenwu and Kaogu Articles on Mawangdui Tombs Two and Three," Early China 1 (1975), 10-15; and Michael Loewe, "Manuscripts Found Recently in China," T'oungPao 63(1978), 114-25. 2.

Additional details on the form and content of all three copies of Xingde are given in a companion volume, Mawangdui Hanmu wenwu zongshu (hereafter, Han mu wenwu zongshu). In the intervening years, Chen Songchang (co-editor of Han mu wenwu) has published two articles: "Boshu Xingde liieshuo" fB flr Jf'J consists of a description of the Xingde texts including new infor mation as compared to Hanmu wenwu zongshu; "Boshu Xingde yiben shiwen jiaodu" provides a completely revised transcription of Xingde B.3 Chen, who is a researcher at the Hunan Pro vincial Museum, is also responsible for the publication of a large format book on the calligraphy of the Mawangdui texts, Mawangdui boshu yishu HiEifi SHIS® (Art of the silk manuscripts from Mawangdui; here after, Boshu yishu).4 This work contains the first reproductions of those portions of Xingde A that concern the Xing-De method as well as repro ductions of copy B of Yinyang wuxing Wt TL ff (Yin-yang and the five agents), which also has passages dedicated to the Xing-De method.5 Because the Boshu yishu reproductions are fragmentary and incomplete, and lack any critical apparatus, we cannot derive a clear overall idea of the two manuscripts from them. They are still very useful, however, in the collation of Xingde B published in Hanmu wenwu.6 Since 1992 other scholars have also published articles on the Xingde texts from Mawangdui. Jao Tsung-I (Rao Zongyi) ff| Tf&lt; I® has studied the captions on the diagram of the nine palaces.7 Li Xueqin who was one of the first to draw attention to the significance of these texts, has also published an article on the military titles associated with 3.

Mawangdui boshu yishu (Shanghai: Shanghai shudian, 1996). 5. In this article I use Xingde to refer to the texts assigned this title in the first reports of the Mawangdui excavations; the term Xing-De is used in a wider sense to refer to the method described in these texts as well as others. 6. The Boshu yishu reproductions of Xingde A include a fragment corresponding to columns 23-38 of Xingde B (except for a gap between columns 28-33 of the latter) and an additional column at the end; and a second fragment corresponding to columns 88-97 of Xingde B (pp. 120-28). A color plate reproduces text corresponding to Xingde B, columns 82-97 (p. 10). For Yinyang wuxing B, seven fragments are reproduced (pp. 129-56), of which three are concerned with the Xing-De method. Fragment 4 (p. 145) is of particular significance because it contains the section of the text studied in this article (Xingde B, columns 2-15). 7.

I then turn to the sexagenary grid, and to explaining the principles that underlie the annual rotation of Xing (Punishment) and De (Virtue). Moving on to the diagram of the nine palaces, I examine their diurnal rotation. In the absence of a complete edition of the relevant Mawangdui manu scripts, my conclusions must be seen as a preliminary effort to show how the Xingde texts can help us to understand better the distinctive features of the development of Chinese astro-calendrical practices. The Xingde B Manuscript We have three copies of the texts that the team first charged with organizing the Mawangdui manuscripts called Xingde. Xingde A (Xingde jiapian JflJ rp j§|), in old-style clerical script (guli "fi"ft), was transcribed between the eleventh and twelfth years (196-195 b.c.) of the reign of Han Gaozu SI Sill, founder of the dynasty.11 Xingde B (Xingde yipian JflJ tHZlSl), in Han clerical script (Han li fUft), cannot be earlier than the reign of Emperor Hui (r. 195-188 B.C.), who is mentioned in the text, and not later than the twelfth year of Emperor Wen (168 B.C.), the date when Mawangdui tomb no. 3 was sealed.12 8.

The date recorded in the cell yisi (n42) of the sexagenary grid of Xingde A men tions the eleventh year of "the present emperor" (jin huangdi M%; see below), a date that can only correspond to the eleventh year of Gaozu (196 B.C.). Since the reign of this emperor came to an end the following year (195 B.C.), it is likely that the manu script was copied during this time. See Chen Songchang, "Xingde lueshuo," 101. 12. The absence of any mention of the reigns of Empress Gao |5J ffj (r. 187-180 B.C.) or Emperor Wen (r. 179-157 B.C.) could indicate that Xingde B was copied during the</page><page sequence="4">128 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI These two copies are very close to each other. Their content is the same, and the repetition of columns 95 and 96 in Xingde B shows that the copyist had before his eyes a text arranged in exactly the same fashion as in Xingde A.13 Since most of the variants concern factual data such as the dates entered in the sexagenary grid and the description of the diurnal rotations of Xing-De for the eleventh year of Gaozu, there is every reason to think that copy B is an updating of copy A redacted some twenty years later by a specialist in calendrical techniques.14 Thus, the variants between the two copies do not necessarily indicate different textual traditions but rather seem to be the result of deliberate action by the copyist himself, even though he may well have used other versions of the text as he carried out his work. The condition of Xingde C (Xingde bingpian ffiJflUpflt) is not good enough to permit reconstruction of the text in a connected form. On the basis of the eighteen fragments, the team charged with editing the manu scripts believes the text is comparable to the other two. Written in old style clerical script, it belongs to the group of manuscripts copied at the end of Gaozu's reign. It is also noteworthy for being written in red ink, a fact that distinguishes it from the others.15 With respect to the Xing De method, the reproduction of parts of Yinyang wuxing B (Yinyang wu xing yipian mmiEfrZ&gt;M) in Boshu yishu shows that this text accords a significant place to it. Several passages are identical to passages in Xingde B, especially the one concerning the principles behind the method.16 Their presence in Yinyang wuxing B, whose content is related to the tra dition of "day texts" (rishu H fH), shows that the Xing-De method was among the most widespread of the hemerological procedures current at the end of the Warring States (475-222 B.C.) and the beginning of the Han.17 reign of Emperor Hui himself since he is the last emperor mentioned in the text. However, another astro-calendrical manuscript from Mawangdui, the Wuxingzhan EM d5; contains tables of planetary ephemerides for the years from 246 B.C., as in Xingcie B, but ending at the third year of Emperor Wen (177 B.C.; see columns 86,100, 135). The calligraphic style of the two manuscripts is the same, suggesting that they were copied at about the same time at the beginning of the reign of Emperor Wen.

For transcriptions I have followed Chen Songchang's revised and corrected version, which has the advantage of filling lacunae in the manuscript on the basis of parallel passages in the other two texts.18 Xingde B occupies a horizontal sheet of silk that is 84 cm long and 44 cm high. In the upper righthand section (roughly 50 cm of the total length), two diagrams have been drawn: on the right, a depiction of the nine palaces, and a sexagenary grid on the left. Beneath the diagrams are sixty-one columns of text, numbered 1 to 61 by the editors of the Hanwu wenwu. Each column contains twenty to twenty-five characters. The lefthand part of the manuscript (roughly 34 cm of the total length) is made up of another text written in thirty-six columns, numbered 62 to 97 by Chen Songchang (Fig. 2).19 These columns run the entire height of the manuscript and are about three times as long as the others. The composition of Xingde A is nearly the same, except that the layout of the sections of the text on the sheet of silk is reversed (Fig. I).20 Based on this layout we may divide Xingde B into two separate parts. The first part, dealing only with the Xing-De method, consists of the two diagrams and the text that accompanies them (columns 1-61). Red dots placed over certain columns indicate a division of the text into ® Eff 0 Wr, Hanbo yanjiu 2 (1996), 138^17. We now have some ten manu scripts identified by the authors of excavation reports as being rishu (see Liu Lexian, "Jiudian Chujian Rishu yanjiu" A)®/iffS 0 IrW^E, Huaxue 2 [1996], 61). The most complete and best studied are Rishu A and B from Shuihudi lllljftitfi tomb no. 11, Hubei (discovered in 1975; burial dated ca. 217 B.C.). For discussions in languages other than Chinese, see Marc Kalinowski, "Les traites de Shuihudi et l'hemerologie chinoise a la fin des Royaumes Combattants," T'oung-Pao 72 (1986), 175-228; and Poo Mu-chou, "Popular Religion in Pre-Imperial China: Observations on the Almanacs of Shui-hu-ti," T'oung-Pao 79 (1993), 225-47. The most exhaustive study of these texts is Liu Lexian, Shuihudi Qinjian Rishu yanjiu 0 U W5S (Taipei: Wenjin, 1994). The spread of the Xing-De method during this period is also confirmed by manuscripts from Fuyang Anhui (beginning of the Han), that contain a text accurately identified as related to this divination procedure, including a diagram that seems to be a sexagenary grid like that in Xingde B from Mawangdui (see "Fuyang Hanjian jianjie" ^.|!l§?JIffiff0i/i\ Wenwu J 1983.2, 21-23). For other references to the use of Xing and De in manuscripts, see n. 79 below. 18. Chen Songchang, "Xingde yiben shiwen." Given the many errors in it, the tran scription in Hanwu wenwu should not be used. The reproductions of Xingde A and Yinyang wuxing B in Boshu yishu permit us to double-check many of Chen Songchang's emendations. 19. I follow Chen Songchang's numbering of the columns; he adds a supplemen tary column between columns 84 and 85, giving a total of ninety-seven columns in stead of the ninety-six given in Hanwu wenwu (see "Xingde yiben shiwen," 87, n. 25). 20.

The "s" stands for stem, "b" for branch, and "n" for binom (the combined stem and branch).

After sixty years, a full circuit (is completed). The cycle ends on guihai (n60) and begins again from jiazi (nl). When Xing and De start moving, they join in Wood after six (twenty?) years. They separate after four years and, after being separated for sixteen years, they join again in Wood. Dayin joins with De in Wood after sixteen years. For six days, Xing and De circulate jointly and each of them shifts to the non-conquest position. Xing circulates in the odd (palaces) on zi (bl) and unites with De in the regular (palaces) on wu (b7). That is why they unite on wu (b7) and separate on zi (bl). On wuzi (n25) Xing and De do not penetrate the Central palace and shift directly to the Eastern palace. On wuwu (n55), De pene trates but Xing does not and shifts directly to the Southeastern palace.

On the basis of its divinatory content it should be placed in the category "Numbers and Techniques" (shushu Ifcflj) of the Hanshu yj| U bibliographic treatise; and, for the Xing-De part of the manuscript, in the sub-group "Five Agents" (wuxing Efr), alongside works like the Xingde JflJ |§ in seven juan &amp; and the Wuyin qigai xingde in twenty-one juan.28 However, the exclusively military application of the prognostications mentioned in both parts of Xingde B means that it also fits into the "Military Yin-yang" (bing yinyang ix|^|I§§) sub-group of the "Military Texts" (bingshu j^U) category that the Hanshu bibliographic treatise defines as follows: m mmmmmm, mmm, mn-m, her i. The yin-yang [military] specialists operate in compliance with the seasons. They calculate Xing-De, follow the striking of the Dipper, conform to the Five Conquests, and rely on the ghosts and spirits for help.29 There are many ancient texts that show the wide diffusion of Xing De procedures in a military context.30 It is known that astrologers and diviners held positions among the officers charged with following the development of military campaigns. The Liutao 7\ provides an ideal ized system of nomenclature, but one that is nonetheless instructive, of the eighteen types of specialists that make up the immediate entourage of army leaders. Astrologers come in third position, just after the confi dential adviser (fuxin yiren JjE'Lj"— A) and the strategists (moushi H!dr).

In this regard the Xingde texts and other manuscripts of the same type discovered at Mawang dui—works like the Tianwen qixiang zazhan and the Wuxingzhan32 71 ffi (Prognostications drawn from the five planets)—are documents of the highest importance. The Table of the Sixty Binoms The table of the sixty binoms is located in the upper left of the Xing De part of Xingde B. It has a rectangular shape, 18 cm by 30 cm, and consists of three elements: a sexagenary grid drawn in red ink, text written in black ink, and small dots variously positioned on the grid (Fig. 3). I analyze the three elements one by one, moving from the repre sentation of space and time in ancient China to the sexagenary notation of years and the annual movement of Taiyin (Great Yin). The Sexagenary Grid The grid that forms the table is made up of sixty identical cells arranged in six columns of ten. Each cell, square in form, has a central cross form ing an orthogonal division with, in the corners, four right angles opening to the exterior. The periphery of the cell is thus punctuated by the ends of twelve lines, three on each side. In the lower righthand corner of the cells are written the sixty binoms of the sexagenary cycle, from top to bottom and from right to left. The six binoms containing the stem jia (si) are related to the first cells in the six columns (nl, nil, n21, n31, n41, n51), and the six binoms containing the stem gui (slO) to the bot tom ones (nlO, n20, n30, n40, n50, n60). As is discussed below, the binoms in the grid represent calendrical years; similarly, the twelve line-ends in the cells represent the twelve branches and indicate positions in space. The Mawangdui manuscripts include three other examples of the use of this kind of cell. First, in the Xingde texts themselves they also appear in the diagram of the nine palaces.

Invisible from the outside and intended to support the remains of the dead in their ultimate resting place, their presence testifies to the reli gious dimension attributed to these figures (Fig. 8:c).42 On liubo playing boards the cord-hook diagram occurs in combina tion with another motif that has affinities with the ya-shaped design (yaxing tu SijfZ [§|) whose origins go back to Shang cultic and divinatory traditions (Fig. 9).43 Thus, although the sexagenary grid of Xingde B seems 40. Li Ling, "Shi yu Zhongguo gudai de yuzhou moshi" jL Zhongguo wenhua 4 (1991), 1-30. The term "astrolabe diagram" seems too narrow to me since it imposes the idea that the cord-hook diagram is inseparable from the production of these instruments. Even if the hypothesis of the astro calendrical origin of the diagram seems to be the most plausible one, we have no evidence that the liuren astrolabes of the Han period existed in the same form during more ancient periods, yet cord-hook motifs are already found in the fifth century B.C., closely followed by the TLV motif on the liubo playing boards. 41. Zenghou Yi mu fHftZiK (Beijing: Wenwu, 1989), vol. 2, pi. 126:3. It is possible that the cord-hook motifs reflect an astro-calendrical symbolism since the cover of another chest found in the same tomb has a representation of the sky with the twenty eight celestial lodges (pi. 121). Although very stylized, the four hooks are clearly visible at the four corners of the cover. The two cords are missing and are replaced by the four elongations of the character dou if (representing the constellation Northern Dipper) which divides the plan of the sky into four sectors corresponding to the four seasons. 42. The drawings in Fig. 8:c are based on the coffin lining boards from three Chu tombs: at Zidanku , Hunan (Hunansheng bowuguan, "Changsha Zidanku Zhanguo muguo mu" fk'fo-pWlM StllilTfcSfSS, Wenwu 1974.2,37, fig. 2); at Wangshan Hill, Hubei (Jiangling Wangshan Shazhong Chumu [Beijing: Wen wu, 1996], 18); and at Baoshan 'SlJLl, Hubei (Baoshan Chumu [Beijing: Wen wu, 1991], 19).

It should be noted that cord-hook motifs appear in Chu Kingdom tombs only from the middle to the end of the Warring States period. I thank Alain Thote for pointing this fact out to me. 43.

The ya-shaped design compared to the cord-hook diagram to be intended to help determine the location of calendrical spirits in the course of their cyclical movements, we should not consider the grid as a simple device conceived ad hoc by the Han calendrists or as a bor rowing from the liubo playing board. I do not propose here to trace the evolution leading from the ya-shaped design to the cord-hook diagram or to the liubo board. What is clear is that they all were part of very ancient and widespread cosmological representations that were progres sively refined and adapted to different uses.44 During the Han the special functions assigned to these diagrams were also far from exclusive. The wooden planchette from Yinwan Jiangsu (end of the Former Han), which depicts a fortune-telling procedure and resembles a liubo board with the sixty binoms on it, shows that the game had hemerological E§tSt/ Zhongguo wenhua 4 (1991), 31^47; and Allan, The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), 75 111.

Studies in this area have dealt mostly with the three types of objects belonging to the TLV group (Fig. 7:b-d). Following the line of the research of Schuyler Camman, Michael Loewe developed the hypothesis that the origin of the TLV motif on Han mirrors and liubo boards was to be found among liuren astrolabes (Loewe, Ways to Paradise: The Chinese Quest for Immortality [London: George Allen and Unwin, 1979], 60-85). More recently, Li Jianmin M; R leans towards sundials as a source; see "Handai juxi de qiyuan yu yanbian" D"lu zazhi 77.3 (1988), 1-20 (part 1); 77.4 (1988), 27-47 (part 2).

The problem with these arguments is that the first liubo playing boards are more than two centuries older than the most ancient known examples of the TLV sundial and the liuren astrolabe. A hypothesis concern ing the functional origin of the TLV motif in one of these instruments must presup pose the existence of these instruments as early as the fourth century b.c.

There are three such nota tions in Xingde B: Qin huangdi yuan (first year of the Qin Emperor, 246 b.c.) in the yimao cell (n52), Zhang Chu IJflS (Zhang Chu Kingdom, 209 b.c.) in the renchen cell (n29), and Xiao Hui yuan (first year of the Pious Emperor Hui, 194 b.c.) in the dingwei cell (n44). Xingde A mentions two dates: Zhang Chu (209 b.c.) in the renchen cell (n29) and jin huangdi shiyi "rfM (eleventh year of the present Emperor) in the yisi cell (n42), which corresponds, as was noted above, to the eleventh year of the reign of Han Gaozu (196 B.C.).49 The discovery of the Mawangdui Xingde texts proves that the sixty binoms were already being used to identify years at the beginning of the Han. The tradition that the sexagenary year-count (jiazi jinian 15^) came into use after the Taichu Jk9J era (104-101 B.C.) or even later 48.

The Qin period is defined by the accession of the future First Emperor to the Qin throne in 246 B.C. and not by the formation of the Qin kingdom into an empire in 221.

The main function of the grid is not chronological but hemerological; that is, its function is not primarily to count the number of years that have passed since the accession of the future First Emperor to the throne of the Qin kingdom in 246 B.C. but to show the annual shift of Dayin jz ^ (Taiyin in the received texts) and Xing-De in relation to the sixty binoms for divinatory purposes. The positions of Taiyin are indi cated on the grid by small dots (shown in black in Fig. 3) placed on the line-ends of the cord-hook diagrams. In the year jiazi (nl), Taiyin is at the line-end corresponding to zi (bl), in the year yichou (n2) it is at the line-end corresponding to chou (b2), and so on (in each case there is correspondence between the branch associated with the line-end and the branch element of the binom). After a complete circuit, in the thir teenth year, bingzi (nl3), Taiyin is back where it started at zi (bl). In Xingde A we find the following text written on the sexagenary grid: an, MJE-m. xm&amp;m, mmm. In the eleventh year of the [present] Emperor, Dayin is at si (b6). It moves to the left, stopping each year at a (different) branch. During battle one must avoid attacking the position occupied by Dayin.51 The text first notes the position of Taiyin for a specific year, then the direction of its movement around the twelve branches (to the left; that is, from North to East, South, and West on the cord-hook diagram), and finally its divinatory function. The annual movement of Taiyin is described in several ancient texts, principally in the Huainanzi where it occupies a significant place. In the chapter "Tianwen" Ji SC ("Celestial patterns") alone, Taiyin is mentioned thirty times. Here is one passage, which deals with its annual movement within the Great Epoch (yuan jt) cycle of 4560 years in the Quarter-day calendar:52 50. See Li Xueqin, "Ganzhi jinian he shier shengxiao qiyuan xinzheng"; and Guo Moruo "Shi zhigan" in Guo Moruo,]iagu wenzi yanjiu ¥ (Hong Kong: Zhonghua, 1976), 288-89. 51.

According to the Quarter-day system (sifen li), which underlies the calculation of luni-solar conjunctions in calendars before the development of the Taichu calen dar (104 B.C.), the base unit is the zhang fSc (nineteen years), the period at the end of which the new moon (first day of the month in the civil calendar) returns to the same</page><page sequence="23">MARC KALINOWSKI 147 nzit. wtffe-m. ALmz^mnmmm^m. When the Epoch (cycle) begins, Taiyin is established in jiayin (n51). After the first completion it is established in jiaxu (nil); after the second completion it is established in jiawu (n31); and after the third completion it returns to the jiayin Epoch (nil). It shifts one branch every year. After the Beginning of Spring, when it gets to its (corresponding) branch, it moves to the next position.53 The fact that the movement of Taiyin should here be related with the three periods of 1520 years that make up the Great Epoch cycle shows the importance given to it in the application of the sexagenary norms to the formalization of heavenly motions.54 Taiyin appears in the passage as a time-spirit that evolves year after year as it follows the twelvefold cycle of the branch elements of the sixty binoms. The passage also pro vides additional information that does not appear in the Xingde texts: the precise day on which Taiyin changes position each year. Note that the change follows the solar cycle, on the days after the Beginning of Spring (roughly February 4).55 Apart from this calendrical function, the Huainanzi attributes to Taiyin a large number of hemerological functions. It is among the celestial spirits day in the solar year (usually the winter solstice). For such a conjunction to occur at the same hour of the day, four zhang must pass, producing a bu §|5 (seventy-six years). For the day to have the same binom in the sexagenary sequence requires twenty bu (one ji or 1520 years). Finally, for the year also to have the same binom in the sexagenary sequence requires three ji, which make up the Epoch cycle {yuan) men tioned here. The ji and the yuan are essentially calendrical units associated with the application of the sexagenary norms to the calculation of astronomical periods. See Christopher Cullen, Astronomy and Mathematics in Ancient China: The Zhoubi suanjing (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 24-27. 53. Tianwen xun buzhu, 82a-b; Major, Heaven and Earth in Early Han Thought, 118— 19. Qian Tang has established the connection of the Quarter-day system with the calculation of the Epoch cycle; Major does not follow Qian, and translates the begin ning of the passage (Taiyin yuanshi C# ft th) as "the beginning of the Jovian cycle." Besides being far from the original, this translation implies that the passage in question deals only with the Jovian cycle, which is far from being the case (see below, n. 125). The years that mark the beginning of the three cycles of completion (sanzhong El$?) are the year 1 (jiayin), the year 1521 (jiaxu), and the year 3041 (jiawu). 54. This is why the sexagenary year count is sometimes called the Taiyin year count (Taiyin jinian see, for example, Qian Tang's commentary at Tianwen xun buzhu, 82a. 55.

Taiyin and the Jovian Year Count It is generally accepted that Taiyin is a year-count unit based on the combination of its cycle with that of Jupiter. In the Jovian year count system (suixing jinian having fixed the sidereal rotation of Jupiter at an ideal twelve years and its tropical rotation at an ideal thirteen months, there is always correspondence between the position of the planet in the twelve celestial divisions, the month of the year, and the position of Taiyin in the twelve branch elements of the sixty binoms.57 In Xingde B, the annual movement of Taiyin is not accompanied by any direct reference to Jupiter. Its relation to the planet was, however, well known at the time in the region of the Mawangdui tomb since the Wuxingzhan describes very precisely how to combine their respective cycles: ... ssiiiiz. s- sist?t = • • • mmmmm.xm&amp;m,mmmzw-w +- m - m m?... ... Jupiter and Dayin are in resonance with each other. When Dayin dwells in a corner-branch (weichen ffifiS), Jupiter dwells in two cor ner-lodges (weixiu Hifg). When Dayin dwells in a middle-branch (zhongchen 4' Wk), Jupiter dwells in three middle-lodges (zhongxiu 56. For the hemerological uses of Taiyin in the Huainanzi, see Kalinowski, "Xingde shitan," 86. 57. This system is idealized because the sidereal revolution of Jupiter actually takes 11.86 years and its synodic revolution 399 days (or 33.75 days more than the solar year of 365.25 days). The system lags by one celestial division every eighty-three years, a lag to which the Han astro-calendrists gave the name of chaochen In hx "division overlap." Pre-imperial sources like the Zuozhuan SifljE and the Guoyu ||i§ attest to the existence of a notation of the sidereal positions of Jupiter well before the first evidence of the application of the sexagenary cycle to the recording of years. The evolution leading from the system of sidereal positions to that of Jovian year names and to the sexagenary year count that underlies the annual revolution of Taiyin is little known. Here I shall limit myself to stressing how the role played by Taiyin in the Mawangdui Xingde texts can help us to understand better its relationship with Jupi ter. For a general and somewhat dated presentation of the Jovian cycle, see Leopold de Saussure, Les origines de Vastronomie chinoise (Leiden: Brill, 1909; reprinted, Taipei: Chengwen, 1967), 315-406.</page><page sequence="25">MARC KALINOWSKI 149 cja fS) • • • Jupiter dwells in lodges Wei H and Ji M- Dayin shifts leftwards and joins (with Jupiter) at the borderline between yin and yang. They both take twelve years to complete a circuit of heaven and earth. Dayin's dwellings in the twelve branches start from zi (bl)...58 The same procedure is reported in the Huainanzi in slightly different terms: When Taiyin is in the four midpoints (sizhong 23 \$), Jupiter passes through three lodges. When Taiyin is in the four hooks (sigou H r£&amp;J), Jupiter passes through two lodges. Two times eight is sixteen; three times four is twelve. Therefore, in twelve years (Jupiter) passes through the twenty-eight celestial lodges.59 It is also in this work that we find the first complete formulation of the Jovian year count in relation with Taiyin (Table 2). In addition to the correspondences between the position of Taiyin in the twelve branches, that of Jupiter in the twenty-eight celestial lodges, and the month dur ing which the heliacal rising of the planet takes place, the Huainanzi mentions the names given to each of the twelve years in the cycle. For example, when Taiyin is in the yin (b3) corner-branch, Jupiter resides in the corner-lodges Dou if and Niu 41 in the celestial division chou (b2), and its heliacal rising occurs in the eleventh month at zi (bl), the Jovian name of the current year is Shetige fil 58. Wuxingzhati, columns 4H3. Dots of elision indicate lacunae in the text. The terms wei "corner" and zhong "middle" refer to the distribution of the twelve branches and the twenty-eight celestial lodges on the twelve line-ends of the cord-hook dia gram (zhong denotes the line-ends forming the two cords and wei the line-ends form ing the four hooks; see Fig. 6). Jupiter and Taiyin move in opposite directions, as can be seen in Table 2. Their points of intersection are located between the branches chou (b2) and yin (b3) and between the branches wei (b8) and shen (b9)—that is, at the borders on the cord-hook diagram separating the yin seasons (autumn and winter) from the yang seasons (spring and summer), the "borderline between yin and yang" in the text. 59.

For details concerning Table 2, see Major's commentary to his translation (pp. 122-23). The heliacal risings mark the starting point for the synodic revolutions of Jupiter. The passage from one month to the next is determined by the theoretical lag of one month for each complete revolution (see above, n. 57). In the Jovian year count proper, the binoms for the years are indicated with particular terms for the twelve branches and the ten stems. Shetige is the name given to the first year of the cycle of twelve, which corresponds in the ancient form of nomenclature to the branch yin (b3).</page><page sequence="26">150 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI Table 2: The Jovian year-count in relation to Taiyin according to the Huainanzi Taiyin Jovian Name Sidereal Position Heliacal Rising yin b3 Shetige b2 corner / Dou Niu 11th month mao b4 Ming'e bl middle / Nii Xu Wei 12th month chen b5 Zhixu bl2 corner/Shi Bi 1st month si b6 Dahuangluo bll corner/Kui Lou 2nd month wu b7 Dunzang blO middle / Wei Mao Bi 3rd month wei b8 Xiexia b9 corner / Zi Shen 4th month shen b9 Tuntan b8 corner/Jing Gui 5th month you blO Zuo'e b 7 middle/Liu Xing Zhang 6th month xu bll Yanmao b6 corner / Yi Zhen 7th month hai bl2 Dayuanxian b5 corner/Jiao Kang 8th month zi bl Kundun b4 middle / Di Fang Xin 9th month chou b2 Chifenruo b3 corner/Wei Ji 10th month This idealized representation of the relationship between the annual movement of Taiyin and the rotation of Jupiter assumes the existence of the customary layout of the twelve branches and twenty-eight celestial lodges as it appears in the Shashi cord-hook diagram (Fig. 6) and on all the liuren astrolabes from the Han. Only under this circumstance can the annual movements of Taiyin and Jupiter constitute an integrated system functioning in a regular, constantly recurring fashion. For example, if in one year Taiyin is in yin (b3; a corner-branch) and Jupiter is in Dou/Niu, corresponding to chou (b2; a corner-division), in the following year Taiyin will be in mao (b4; a middle-branch) and Jupiter in Nii ^c/Xu US/Wei corresponding to zi (bl; a middle-division), and so on.61 The problem with the statement about the correlation between Taiyin and Jupiter in the Wuxingzhan lies in the fact that it does not correspond to the description of planetary cycles that constitutes the main part of the manuscript. One only has to look at the first twelve years of the Jovian year count (from the first to the twelfth year of the First Emperor, 246-234 b.c.) to become aware of the discrepancy (see Table 3).62 The first thing to note is that the Wuxingzhan table for Jupiter men 61. The layout turns out to be even more idealized in that the width of the celestial lodges varies from two degrees for the smallest to more than thirty degrees for the largest. For a table of the width of the lodges and correspondences with Western stellar terminology, see Cullen, Astronomy and Mathematics in Ancient China, 18. 62. The Jupiter cycle turns up in two places in the text: first in a general account mentioning the Jovian year names but without any connection to historical chronol ogy (columns 1-4); and later, in the section on ephemerides, which does not mention the exact Jovian year names (columns 77-88). There are two variants in the lodges used to indicate the sidereal position of the planet, but I have not taken them into account here.</page><page sequence="27">MARC KALINOWSKI 151 Table 3: The ephemerides for Jupiter for the first twelve years of the First Emperor (246-234 B.C.) according to the Wuxingzhan 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 lovian Name Sidereal Position Heliacal Rising Shetige bl2 corner/Shi 1st month Ming'e bl2 corner/Bi 2nd month Zhixu bll corner/ Lou 3rd month Dahuangluo blO middle/Bi 4th month Dunzang b8 corner/Jing 5th month Xiexia b 7 middle/Liu 6th month Tuntan b7 middle / Zhang 7th month Zuo'e b6 corner/Zhen 8th month Yanmao b5 corner / Kang 9th month Dayuanxian b4 middle / Xin 10th month Kundun b2 corner / Dou 11th month Chifenruo bl middle/Nu 12th month tions neither the sexagenary binoms nor the positions of Taiyin that correspond to the current years. Nor can the correlation between Taiyin and Jupiter be deduced from the Wuxingzhan passage already cited above, since the succession of corner-lodges and middle-lodges is not consistent. To be able to apply a principle such as, "when Dayin resides in a corner-branch, Jupiter resides in two corner-lodges; when Dayin resides in a middle-branch, Jupiter resides in three middle-lodges," it would be necessary for the twenty-eight celestial lodges to succeed each other in a rhythm of two groups of corner-lodges followed by one group of middle-lodges, as in the standard layout of the cord-hook diagram (hook, hook, cord, hook, hook, cord, hook, hook, cord, hook, hook, cord)—which is not the case. In addition, the celestial lodges that mark the position of Jupiter in the first month (Shi S) and second month (Bi If) belong to the same celestial division, hai (bl2). In other words, the Jovian year count in the Wuxingzhan table cannot be reduced to a sys tem of astro-calendrical correspondence that would permit combining Jupiter's rotation with the annual movement of Taiyin. Next, the Wuxingzhan Jovian year-count is different in its own right from the year-count mentioned in the Huainanzi. According to the Huai nanzi: JOSHES, n. When Taiyin is in yin (b3), this is called Shetige. Jupiter, its male mate, resides in the lodges Dou and Niu and rises with them in the East at dawn in the eleventh month.63 63.

The passage corresponds to the first row in Table 2.</page><page sequence="28">152 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI The Wuxingzhan states: When Jupiter rises with the lodge Shi in the East at dawn in the first month, its name is Shetige.64 The Wuxingzhan version is nearly the same as the citation of the Taichu calendar in the Hanshu astrological treatise, with two differences. First, the Hanshu passage arranges the succession of the twenty-eight celestial lodges in two groups of corner-lodges to one group of middle-lodges so that it fits the standard layout of the cord-hook diagram. Second, the spirit that moves through the twelve branches is no longer Taiyin as in the texts from the early Han, but Taisui M (Great Year). For example: sarniEE mmmio, When Taisui is located in yin (b3), this is called Shetige. Jupiter rises in the East at dawn in the first month. According to the Taichu calendar, the planet is in the lodges Shi Jj| and Bi §jr.65 The use of Taisui to designate the cycle of the twelve branches associated with the rotation of Jupiter is apparently an innovation. In the Huainanzi, Taisui not only appears as a hemerological function with attributes very different from those of Taiyin, but also its cycle is monthly, occupying only the four sectors zi (bl), mao (b4), ivu (b7), and you (blO); it does not follow an annual cycle through all twelve branches.66 Finally, since all the Han texts agree in associating the Shetige year with the branch yin (b3), one would assume that the first year of the First Emperor (246 B.C.), identified in the Wuxingzhan as a Shetige year (heliacal rising of Jupiter at dawn in the lodge Shi), must have been a jiayin (n51) year. However, the sexagenary grid in Xingde B, and to a certain extent the motion of Taiyin described in the Wuxingzhan, show that at the beginning of the Han the first year of the First Emperor was considered to be a yimao (n52) year. Since the publication of the Wuxing zhan at the end of the 1970's, the contradictions between the data pro vided by the Jovian year count and the traditional sexagenary system of dating which associated the year 246 b.c. with the binom yimao (n52) have given rise to many discussions of the evolution of the Jupiter cycle 64.

This is not the place to take up this debate. I note only the points that help us to understand better the role played by Taiyin in connection with the annual rotations of Xing and De:67 (1) The Xingde texts from Mawangdui provide incontrovertible proof of the existence of a sexagenary year count from as early as the end of the Warring States period. We may note especially that the binoms associated with the reign years of the emperors that suceeded each other after the first year of the First Emperor (246 b.c.) agree with the traditional system that was generally accepted by the end of the Former Han. Even if, at the beginning of the Han dynasty, its use was restricted to the calendar makers, it was virtually unanimously accepted, as is shown by the fact that it was integrated into the framework of official chronology in the form it had at that time. (2) The movement of Taiyin is closely associated with the sexagenary year count. In the Xingde texts, Taiyin moves by following the twelve line-ends of the cord-hook diagram, which represent the branch elements of the annual binoms. In the Huainanzi it appears as a calendrical spirit whose mantic virtues and power to control, initiated at the beginning of time, arise from the application of the sexagenary norm to the numbering of the years. 67. On the problems associated with the indication of the Jupiter cycle in the Wuxingzhan, see Chen Jiujin "Cong Mawangdui boshu Wuxingzhan de chutu shitan woguo gudai de suixing jinian wenti" M12full!, Zhongguo tianwenxue shi wetiji 1 (1978), 48-65; Chen Jiujin and Chen Meidong "Cong Yuanguang lipu ji Mawangdui boshu Wuxingzhan de chutu zaitan Zhuanxu li wenti" Iff P9II, Xueshu yanjiu 1980.6, 82-87; He Youqi Sf, "Guanyu Wuxingzhan wenti da kenan" Xueshu yanjiu 1981.3,97-103; Hashimoto Keizo "Sengyoku rekigen to saisei kinenho" j§| m®7C t MMi£¥&amp;, Toho gakuho 59 (1987), 323-43. 68. Existing studies on the reconstruction of the Jovian year count during the Qin and at the beginning of the Han generally take as a departure point the hypothesis that the sexagenary recording of years had not yet become fixed at that time, which leads to the idea that the phenomenon of Jupiter's "division overlap" (chaochen) must automatically bring an equivalent jump in the annual binom that fixes the position of Taiyin. I find it difficult to agree with Chen Jiujin and Chen Meidong when they say that "according to the indications in the Wuxingzhan, the first year of the First Em peror was a jiayin (n51) year" ("Cong Yuangguang lipu ji Mawangdui boshu Wuxingzhan," 110) because the sexagenary grid in Xingde B clearly proves that this year was considered at the time to be a yimao (n52) year.</page><page sequence="30">154 THE XINCDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI (3) An examination of the sources dealing with the annual motion of Taiyin in the Wuxingzhan and the Huainanzi shows that, far from being a function derived from the Jovian year count (a "counter Jupiter" cycle, as it is often called), it is rather the Taiyin motion that requires that the Jupiter rotations be fitted to the framework of the sexagenary norm of the calendar. In the passage in the Wuxingzhan on the mutual resonance (xiangying tgfSl) between Taiyin and Jupiter (see above, pp. 148-49), we see that the position of Taiyin in the twelve branches is given first, and then the corre sponding position of Jupiter among the twenty-eight celestial lodges is calculated from that position, and not the reverse. In addition, if the Jovian year count were the necessary precondi tion for a Taiyin cycle, it is hard to understand why the sidereal positions of Jupiter mentioned in the manuscript do not fit the conventional layout of branches and celestial lodges on the cord hook diagram. (4) Related to the preceding point, the representation of the annual motion of Taiyin on the Xingde B sexagenary grid does not imply any functional connection between the Jovian year count and the rotations of Xing and De. The presence of Taiyin there is due, as is also the case in the Wuxingzhan in connection with Jupiter, to its role as a calendrical spirit associated with the sexagenary counting of years. The difference is that Xing and De are themselves calendric spirits whose rotations show, following the pattern of Taiyin, the deployment in space and time of the stems and branches making up the sixty binoms. These two texts complement each other. They testify to the existence of a cosmos fashioned in the Qin and early Han from shared astro-calendrical conceptions, and to the complexity of divinatory beliefs and practices associ ated with these conceptions. 69. This does not exclude the possibility, supported by a number of ancient texts, that the Taiyin cycle was originally conceived on the model of the revolutions of Jupi ter to give the sexagenary year count astronomical legitimacy. We shall see that this was also true of the De and Xing revolutions, which are symbolically associated with those of the sun and moon. Nevertheless, the new evidence provided by the Mawangdui texts demonstrates the need for caution in considering the relationship between Taiyin and Jupiter in the context of calendrical astrology at the end of the Warring States and beginning of the Han. When we read the Huainanzi in the light of these texts we also see the leading role given at that time to Taiyin in the Jupiter cycle as well as the other cycles based on the sexagenary calendrical norm. If not com pletely false, the term "counter-Jupiter" applied to Taiyin is nonetheless a misleading characterization at this stage in the evolution of techniques of counting years.</page><page sequence="31">MARC KALINOWSKI 155 The Annual Rotation of Xing-De Cultural Background and Divinatory Functions The ideas of Xing and De are deeply rooted in the religious culture of ancient China. During the Western Zhou (eleventh to ninth centuries B.C.), the doctrine of the "veneration of Virtue" (jingde SAW) developed in close connection with that of the "mandate of Heaven" (tianming dp). Virtue then appeared as a divine charisma granted by Heaven to an individual man. Such a man saw himself as invested with the power to rule the world. His duty was to venerate Virtue, to preserve it, and to perfect it by his meritorious deeds. In the most ancient texts, the opposite of Virtue is expressed mostly in negating terms like "unpropitious Virtue" (.xiongde [XIf|§), "light Virtue" (shuangde sJ^fg), "depraved Virtue" (huangde or "corrupted Virtue" (baide |&amp;|||). It is in the Book of Documents that we find the first uses of the term Xing in association with De to designate two opposed but complementary modalities of the Son of Heaven's rule.70 Later texts develop this meaning for Xing-De by giving it a more and more marked political sense: "By Virtue, one dispenses favors; by Punishment, one rectifies infractions" (WSAMM, J[5).71 The expression Xing-De took on a clearly secularized form in legalist patterns of thought, where there was a tendency to replace it with an other pair of antonyms, shangfa Ufa "rewards and punishments."72 Parallel to this, with the development of cosmological thought and the yin-yang and Five Agent doctrines (yinyang wuxing 31 ff), the action of Heaven was seen more and more as an impersonal organizing power working on the world through the regular rhythms of nature. The rotation of the stars, the cycle of the seasons, and the alternating of yin and yang became the expressions of an immanent natural order that determines the destiny of men. In this context the ancient religious connotations of Xing-De also changed. Texts from the end of the Warring 70. See, for example, Shangshu zhengyi fnflrlEii (Sibu beiyao ed. of Shisanjing zhushu + HH"Liixing" 19.18b, recording words traditionally attributed to King Mu of the Zhou I5J®3E: "The King said ... 'I respect Punishment; those with Virtue are in charge of Punishment'" (EEE3 ... KfitTTfU, WtS'lUffU).

WHISKS# $□-, mmmmm nmn, w w, Yin and yang are the great principles of heaven and earth. The four seasons are the great norms of yin and yang. Punishment and Virtue represent the conformity of the four seasons.... When they are not neglected, the seasonal cycle rolls on uniformly. When they wander from their appointed places, the course of the seasons re verses, anything undertaken is not completed, and, inevitably, great misfortunes occur.74 This type of usage does not imply that Xing and De became cosmological concepts on the same level as yin and yang or the four seasons, and that reference to the use of Xing and De in the older texts must be con sidered incorrect. Even if we are not dealing here with Virtue and Pun ishment in the sense of a considered act carried out by some kind of anthropomorphic being, they continue to represent the expression of an ethico-magical determinism proper to the natural order that they in turn contribute to building on the model of human behavior and the ultimate principle of good government.75 73. See John Major, "The Meaning of Hsing-te," in Chinese Ideas about Nature and Society, ed. Charles Le Blanc and Susan Blader (Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 1987), 281-91. Major distinguishes between two interpretations of Xing-De in ancient texts: one "refers to an overt action of human agency" and the usual translation of Virtue and Punishment fits it perfectly; the other "refers to a cosmological principle" and he finds it more appropriate to translate Xing and De in these cases with natural istic terms like "recision" and "accretion" (p. 291). For further discussion, see n. 75 below. 74. Guanzi (Xin zhuzi jicheng ed.), "Sishi" US 9#, 298. For additional citations, see Kalinowski, "Xingde shitan," 88. There is ample attestation of the cosmological use of Xing-De in excavated Qin and Han manuscripts. See Yates, "The Yin-Yang Texts from Yinqueshan," 93, for Mawangdui manuscripts; and 89, for those from Yinqueshan. For Zhangjiashan manuscripts, see "Jiangling Zhangjiashan Hanjian gaishu" tJlM'iS. Wenwu 1985.1, 13. The cosmological and astrological symbolism of Xing and De is mainly luni-solar. Many texts associate them with the moon and the sun. Other antonyms often share the same symbolism: yin/yang, darkness/light, lunar eclipse/solar eclipse, summer solstice/winter solstice, autumn-winter/spring-summer. The Mawangdui Wuxingzhan associates Xing and De with appearances of Venus in the western and eastern parts of the sky (column 20). 75. In this regard, Major's translation of Xing and De as "recision" and "accretion" (in "The Meaning of Hsing-te") when they refer to a cosmological principle seems mis</page><page sequence="33">MARC KALINOWSKI 157 The divinatory use of Xing and De is part of this cosmological concep tion of the divine and its action on men and society.

First of all, this translation ignores the religious context in which these notions developed, a context in which the distinction between personal and imper sonal action by a divine agency is not sharply distinguished (see Leon Vandermeersch, "Une tradition refractaire a la theologie: la tradition confucianiste," Extreme-Orient Extreme-Occident 6 [1985], 9-21). An expression like tianxing 55ffll "the punishment of heaven" can have a personal or an impersonal meaning depending on the situation and the individuals concerned, without going back to any choice between cosmo logical principle and human action. Finally, Chinese cosmology is constructed on the basis of ideas and categories that, by incorporating human morality into the natural order, meant that "the threatening gulf between Heaven and man was closed before man had time to rethink himself as a solitary exception in a morally neutral universe" (Angus Graham, Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China [LaSalle: Open Court, 1989], 313). Major himself gives an example in which Xing and De appear "in a context that implies a middle ground between, or a combination of, cosmologi cal principles and human governmental actions" ("The Meaning of Hsing-te," 290). In the sphere of correlative cosmology and calendrical astrology, the "middle ground" uses of Xing and De seem to me the most common, and the translation of "harm" and "benefit" adopted by Major in this example is doubtless better than the translation he proposes for general use. Finally, on the level of techniques, the terms "recision" and "accretion" pose certain problems. Major's entire argument rests on the analysis of the method of the "seven dwellings of Xing-De" in the Huainanzi (see below, nn. 80-81). But Qian Tang already noted that the Huainanzi astrological treatise contains two distinct Xing-De methods (Tianwen xun buzhu, 88a-b; also see below, n. 79), and the second is precisely the one described in the Mawangdui Xingde texts. Here the shifts of Xing and De are not ruled by a natural process of the growth and shrinking of the yin and yang energies of the year but rest on arithmetic principles that under lie sexagenary hemerology. In addition, their functions are no different from those of other calendrical spirits such as the Bloody Branch (xuezhi ifllK), the Day Spell (riyan 0 JP), and the multitude of Yearly Miasmas (niansha ^ =$t) which were attached to calendars from as early as the Han. The oldest example of a calendar including calendrical spirits—including the Punishments of the Month (yuexing J] [)f!]|)— was discovered in 1993 at Yinwan; see Yinwan Hanmu jiandu, 128. The endeavor to translate all these terms by giving them a naturalistic meaning that does not "give rise to a certain feeling of intellectual unease" (Major, "The Meaning of Hsing-te," 282) seems to me overdone. While the attempt is worth making, especially when dealing with terms that have elsewhere entered philosophical vocabulary, care must be taken not to generalize and not to systematize a new usage that is basically only a makeshift. 76.

One can expect help and aid from it. Undertakings will be well-omened and obstacles avoided. There are four kinds of Virtues: three are related to the stems and branches and the fourth follows the monthly breaths. In the first three one may distinguish the Virtues associated with the stems, those connected with the branches, and 77 those that combine the stems and the branches. (2) The Punishments related to the stem and branch elements of the days are also three in number. Also, whether it is a matter of heav enly, earthly, or human Punishments, the standard remains the same. There are those Punishments between the branches, those that pit branches against stems, and those that pit stems against branches. This division of the Xing-De practices into two categories also reflects what is found in received texts.79 The procedure based on monthly breaths is described very precisely in the Huainanzi and the Taipingjing It is known primarily under the name of "seven dwellings of Punishment and Virtue" (Xing-De qishe with reference to the seven positions occupied alternately by Xing and De during the course of the twelve months of the year.80 In the Huainanzi their shifts from one 77.

In the excavated manuscripts the differentiation is harder to make because of gaps in the texts or lack of precision in excavation reports. The Fuyang Xingde manu script is probably of the same type as that from Mawangdui (see above, n. 17). A text on a wooden board from Yinwan describes a hemerological procedure based on the ten stems and also is related to the second category of the Wuxing dayi (Yinwan Hanmu jiandu, 145). The method of the seven dwellings is attested in the manuscripts from Juyan Gansu; see Juyan xinjian j|f (Beijing: Wenwu, 1990), EPT 43: 185; EPT 65: 48; and EPS4.T2: 80. We also find divinatory uses of Xing-De in the yin-yang texts from Yinqueshan (nos. 0473, 3311, and 0430), but it is difficult to decide which category they belong in (see Yates, "The Yin-Yang Texts from Yinqueshan," 87 and 132). 80.

It is directly con nected with the procedures described in the Mawangdui Xingde texts and it is appropriate to dwell on them a little longer. We shall begin by presenting the six groups of correlations in the order in which they are enumerated in the Wuxing dayi:82 (1.1) Stem Virtues Stems: si s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s 7 s8 s9 slO Position of De: si s7 s3 s9 s5 si s7 s3 s9 s5 (1.2) Branch Virtues Branches: bl b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 blO bll bl2 Position of De: b6 b7 b8 b9 blO bll bl2 bl b2 b3 b4 b5 (1.3) Combined Stem-Branch Virtues Branches: bl b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 blO bll bl2 Position of De: si s8 s3 s4 s7 s6 s5 s8 s9 slO s7 s2 (2.1) Branch Punishments Branches: bl b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 blO bll bl2 Position of Xing: b4 bll b6 bl b5 b9 b7 b2 b3 blO b8 bl2 (2.2) Branch-on-Stem Punishments Branches: bl b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 blO bll bl2 Position of Xing: s5 s2 s7 s8 si slO s9 s2 s3 s4 si s6 (2.3) Stem-on-Branch Punishments Stems: si s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 slO Position of Xing: b9 blO bl bl2 b3 b4 b7 b6 bll b8 For the mixed groups that combine the stems and branches (1.3, 2.2, and 2.3), correlations are established on the basis of mutual production 81. The passage dealing with the gnomon comes immediately before the one that describes the seven dwellings of Xing-De (Tianwen xun buzhu, 37b). At the Winter Solstice, when the shadow of the gnomon is longest, Xing is in the open countryside (ye if; that is, farthest from the gnomon) while De is inside the house (shi Jj|; that is, close to the gnomon). At the Summer Solstice the situation is reversed: De is in the open countryside while Xing is inside the house. On the connections among the seven dwellings, the system of the sixteen hour-divisions in the Shuihudi manuscripts, and the seven heng jfj in the Zhoubi cosmography, see the analyses by Zeng Xiantong # ^ ill in Jao Tsung-I and Zeng Xiantong, Yunmeng Qinjian Rishu yanjiu S 11 5FF 55 (Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong Press, 1982), 81-95. 82.

Even though these correlations were already in use during the Six Dynasties, we find no systematic account of them in ancient texts, and it may be that they were a late development arising out of the mutual affinities among the ten stems and twelve branches. The relationships where stems influence stems and branches influence branches (1.1,1.2, and 2.1) have a different basis. For 1.2 (branch Virtues), the correlations are such that there is always a lag of five positions be tween each branch and its Virtue. Thus, Virtue for zi (bl) resides in si (b6) because bl + 5 = b6; Virtue for chou (b2) resides in wu (b7) because b2 -)- 5 = b7; and so on. These correlations do not seem to be attested in the ancient texts either.84 But the correlations of the stem Virtues (1.1) and branch Punishments (2.1) were well know by Han times. The Huainanzi presents their theoretical basis, and Xingde B, as we shall see, provides the key that lets us understand how they were conceived. The Annual Rotation in the Xingde Texts As they are presented in the Xingde texts, the rotations of Xing and De follow a double motion. On the one hand, they move according to the days through the nine palaces. This is their "diurnal rotation," which will be taken up in the next section. On the other hand, they move through the cord-hook diagrams according to the annual binoms and, consequently, in relation to the annual movement of Taiyin. The "annual rotation" of De is clearly indicated on the sexagenary grid by the dots placed at the intersection and line-ends of the two cords (in Figs. 3 and 12 the dots representing the positions of De are drawn as circles). For the first year, jiazi (nl), Taiyin is in zi (bl) and De occupies the East position, cord-branch mao (b4). While Taiyin travels from one branch to the next, De moves to the West, cord-branch you (blO), in the second year; to the South, cord-branch zvu (b7), in the third year; to the North, cord-branch zi (bl), in the fourth year; and to the Center (the intersection of the cords) in the fifth year. This five-fold cycle (East-Wood, West-Metal, 83. The mutual production order is Wood-Fire-Earth-Metal-Water. The mutual con quest order is Water-Fire-Metal-Wood-Earth. 84.

This non-conquest cycle86 deserves attention because it is also the order that underlies the doctrine of the alternating of the Five Virtues (zvude zhongshi shuo liW-'iQtnWi) recorded for the first time in the Lushi chunqiu (preface dated 239 b.c.) and applied to the legitimization of dynastic changes.87 In this connection, the discovery of the Mawangdui manuscripts opens up new perspectives on the study of the interactions between cosmological thought and calendrical astrology at the end of the Warring States period. It is odd that the positions occupied by Xing are not noted on the sexagenary grid. But the text of Xingde B leaves no doubt about how its annual movement worked.88 The only difference from De is that Xing does not move through the Center sector (Fig. 12). Thus, while De has a twenty-year cycle consisting of four cycles passing through all five posi tions, Xing has a twenty-year cycle consisting of five cycles passing through four positions (East-Wood, West-Metal, South-Fire, and North Water). That is, the common periodicity of the rotations of Xing and De is twenty years. They begin by occupying the same positions for four years and then slip out of phase, occupying different positions for the following sixteen years. After three periods of twenty years, they have moved through the sixty binoms to return to jiazi (nl) in the same posi tion vis-a-vis Taiyin, that is, vis-a-vis the branch element of this binom. Once the disposition of the information on the sexagenary grid is under stood, the meaning of the text from Xingde B presented at the beginning of this article becomes clear. Here again is the part related to the sexa genary grid, by paragraph. I supplement it with parallel passages from the Huainanzi and the Wuxingzhan, followed by an interpretive discussion. 85. The correlations between the sectors and the Five Agents are not indicated in the cord-hook diagrams but they are mentioned in the text and in the diagram of the nine palaces. 86.

The initial appearance of Dayin is on zi (bl). The initial appearance of Xing is in Water. Water (corresponds to) zi (bl); therefore it is said that Xing and De begin (their cycle) on jiazi (nl). Huainanzi-.X^^^^-, m When Taiyin is in jiazi (nl), Xing and De join in the Eastern palace. Wuxingzhan: Dayin's dwellings in the twelve branches start from zi (bl). In this first passage from Xingde B, the intention is to establish a natural connection between the Xing and De rotations, the annual movement of Taiyin, and the sexagenary year count. It is the stem element of the initial binom jiazi (nl, sl-bl) that marks the position of De, just as its branch element indicates the position of Taiyin. Once we recognize that the jia (si) stem is connected to the East-Wood sector, and the zi (bl) branch to the North-Water sector of the cord-hook diagram (Fig. 6), the formulation in Xingde B is equivalent to that in the Huainanzi giving the respective positions of Taiyin in zi (bl) and De in East-Wood for the first year. On the other hand, the position of Xing is presented in an atypical fashion. Since its cycle begins in the East-Wood sector, as does that of De, we would expect to see "the initial appearance of Xing is in Wood" rather than "in Water." But we shall see further on that, according to the theory of the annual rotation of Xing in the Huainanzi, the Punish ment of the branch zi (bl, North-Water) that marks the beginning of the cycle of Taiyin is actually in the East-Wood sector. This is why the text sets up a connection between Xing and Water, and then between Xing and Taiyin by the intermediary of the branch zi (bl). jgrais. Xing and De have their yearly shift on zi (bl), wu (b7), mao (b4), or you (blO), seven days after the Solstice. De shifts on zi (bl) or wu (b7); Xing shifts on mao (b4) or you (blO). The movement of Xing and De is a yearly shift to the non-conquest position, but Xing does not penetrate the Central palace and stays on the four sides. 89. In the Huainanzi this is the beginning of the passage cited in the next para graph. 90. The Wuxingzhan parallel is from the end of the passage concerning the relation between Taiyin and Jupiter translated above, pp. 148-49 (citation in n. 58).</page><page sequence="40">164 THE X1NCDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI Huainanzi: "n HUM BS. mJMm, When Taiyin is in jiazi (nl), Xing and De join in the Eastern palace. Invariably they shift to the non-conquest position. After being joined for four years, they separate. After being separated for six teen years, they join again. The reason why they separate is that Xing is not able to ^penetrate into the Central palace and shifts (directly) to Wood. This passage describes at what time of year Xing and De change posi tion and the order in which they pass from one sector of the cord-hook diagram to another. There is nothing equivalent to the first two sen tences in the received literature. The term rizhi 0 M "solstice" definitely indicates the Winter Solstice, which in China marks the beginning of the astronomical year. More problematic is the intended understand ing of the four branches zi (bl), zvu (b7), mao (b4), and you (blO). Do they refer to days in this passage, to hours, or to something else? If the refer ence is to days (as seems likely), the change in the position of Xing is established as being on the first day marked by the mao (b4) or you (blO) branch element, seven days after the Winter Solstice. For its part, De changes position three days before or after Xing, on the first zi (bl) or wu (b7) day.92 The date on which Taiyin travels from one branch to another is not mentioned. We have seen that in the Huainanzi it was determined to be on the first day marked by the same branch as that of Taiyin, just after the Beginning of Spring (see above, pp. 146-47). This shows that the coordination of the movement of Taiyin, Xing, and De in relation to the civil calendar was based on the solar year. The last sentence poses no problems of interpretation. The two rules that govern the movements of Xing and De from one sector to another are laid out: first, the rule of the mutual non-conquest of the Five Agents following the order in which the shift takes place (East-Wood, West Metal, South-Fire, North-Water, Center-Earth); then, that of the omis sion of the move to the Center in the case of Xing. The expression "stays on the sides" (ju siyu jg§ H9 PS) in Xingde B is equivalent to "shifts to Wood" ( xi yu mu 7fc) in the Huainanzi since by skipping the Center, Xing moves directly from North-Water to East-Wood. 91. Tianwen xun buzhu, 80a; Major, Heaven and Earth in Early Han Thought, 123. 92. An unfortunately fragmentary passage in the yin-yang texts from Yinqueshan sets Xing and De in relation to the two solstices (Yates, "The Yin-Yang Texts from Yinqueshan," 132), but it is difficult to say whether this refers to the annual rotation of Xing-De.</page><page sequence="41">MARC KALINOWSKI 165 (3.i) mniff.#mu&amp;m, sjiiMffoiiraa, a-hs The initial dwelling of the jiazi (cycle) is in the Southeast. It moves around accordingly. After twenty years, one circuit is completed, during which Xing and De commute four times. After sixty years, a full circuit (is completed). The cycle ends on guihai (n60) and begins again from jiazi (nl). Huainanzi: EPM- —If ¥ J%, — If ffff^¥ tsr, = mm-m. iLmz'&amp;nnmmmnmm. When the Epoch (cycle) begins, Taiyin is established in jiayin (n51). After the first completion it is established in jiaxu (nil); after the second completion it is established in jiawu (n31); and after the third completion it returns to the jiayin Epoch (nil). It shifts one branch every year. After the Beginning of Spring, when itjgets to its (corresponding) branch, it moves to the next position. The beginning of the Xingde B passage alludes to the arrangement of the sixty binoms on the diagram of the nine palaces that control the diurnal rotation of Xing-De (see the following section of this article). This shows that there is a connection between the year-based movement and that which changes according to the day. The rest of the passage describes the properties of the cycles of Xing and De in relation to the sexagenary year count. Since their common periodicity is twenty years (four cycles passing through five positions for De and five cycles passing through four positions for Xing), their movement through the sixty binoms involves three identical periods beginning with jiazi (nl), jiashen (n21), and jiachen (n41). This triple division presents striking similarities with that of the three completions of the Great Epoch cycle that governs the movement of Taiyin in the Huainanzi: jiayin (n51), jiaxu (nil), and jiawu (n31).94 According to the Quarter-day system, one completion cycle (yizhong — If) represents the period of 1520 years needed for the sun and the moon to return to their starting point on the same day of the solar year marked by the same binom, and at the same hour. The purpose of the Great Epoch cycle (3 x 1520 years) is simply to ensure that these initial conditions come about in a year marked by the same sexagenary sign. Thus, the Huainanzi presents Taiyin's annual movement in a context where the sexagenary year-count and the Epoch calculations proper to the Quarter-day system already existed. A similar principle governs the 93. Tianwen xun buzhu, 82.a-b; Major, Heaven and Earth in Early Han Thought, 118— 19. See also the discussion of this passage above, p. 147. 94.

Dayin joins with De in Wood after sixteen years. Huainanzi: After being joined for four years, they (Xing and De) separate. After being separated for sixteen years, they join again. In Xingde B, the phrase "they join in Wood after six years" is incor rect. The phrase does not occur in the Huainanzi, and it could be an interpolation in Xingde B. Alternatively, the character liu A "six" could be a scribal error for nian tf "twenty." Whatever the case may be, the subsequent text is perfectly clear in the matter of the periods of con junction and separation of Xing and De within each of the three periods of the cycle (see also, Fig. 12). The final sentence concerns the periods of conjunction of Taiyin and De. Only the first is noted: the jimao (nl6) year in East-Wood. The others take place in yiyou (n22) in West-Metal, bingwu (n43) in South-Fire, and rcnzi (n49) in North-Water.96 The Theory of the Xing-De Annual Rotation in the Huainanzi The continuation of the Huainanzi passage quoted above as parallel for the second paragraph of Xingde B describes the theory that under lies the shifts of Xing and De on the sexagenary grid: s mmmmm. mm 0 m mm 0 mm*&amp;. ... /i 0 fs. mwik-tn. ±£^p^p, ttfa =mw±&amp;. mte, a±?

The parallel is an extract from the passage cited above, p. 164, n. 91. 96.

In the case of Xing, Water branches move to Wood, Wood branches move to Water, Metal and Fire (branches) stay in their (own) location.... Of the stems, jia (si) is rigid, yi (s2) is pliant; bing (s3) is rigid, ding (s4) is pliant, and so on to gui (slO). Wood is born in hai (bl2), matures in mao (b4) and dies in wei (b8). These three branches are Wood. Fire is born in yin (b3), matures in wu (b7), and dies in xu (bll). These three branches are Fire. Earth is born in wu (b7), matures in xu (bll), and dies in yin (b3). These three branches are Earth. Metal is born in si (b6), matures in you (blO), and dies in chou (b2). These three branches are Metal. Water is born in shen (b9), matures in zi (bl) and dies in chen (b5). These three branches are Water. Thus the Five Conquests (Agents) gener ate in step one, mature in step five, and die in step nine.97 In this passage the correlations between the positions of Xing and De in the sixty binoms are defined according to the terminology of Five Agent theory. After stating that the movement of De is determined by the stems and that of Xing by the branches, the passage describes how the ten stems and twelve branches control the placing of Xing and De in their annual positions. Thus, it becomes possible to determine these positions for any individual year without having to use a spacial repre sentation like the cord-hook diagram. It is enough to know that the Five Agents follow each other in the non-conquest cycle (xi suo busheng and to memorize the correlative layouts of the sexagenary signs and the Five Agents.98 De Movement According to Five Agent Theory Calculation of the position of De as a function of Five Agent theory relies on two elements: the even (pliant-yin) or odd (rigid-yang) status of the ten stems, and the non-conquest cycle of the Five Agents. For the stems in the odd class, the position remains attached to the stem element of the year: in si in si years, in s3 in s3 years, and so on. For stems of the even class, the position of De moves to the odd stems with which they are in a non-conquest relationship: in s2 years De moves to s7 because s2-Wood does not conquer s7-Metal (rather Wood is conquered by Metal), in s4 years it moves to s9 because s4-Fire does not conquer s9 97. Tianwen xun buzhu, 88b-91b; Major, Heaven and Earth in Early Han Thought, 123-24. 98. The yin-yang texts from Yinqueshan contain a passage that attributes to Xing a movement in the opposite direction to that of De: "Five Agents: De moves to the non-conquered position, Xing moves to the conquered position" (Ji fi ff'JfrSee Wu Jiulong Yinqueshan Hanjian shiwen jgjl£ |i|ffiW (Beijing: Wenwu, 1985), 85.</page><page sequence="44">168 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI Water, and so on. Starting from the standard layout of the ten stems on the cord-hook diagram (Fig. 6), the situation with the even stems re sults in a sequence known in later sources as the wuhe Hp "five unions": Standard Positions of the Stems Layout of the Five Unions sl-s2 East-Wood sl-s6 East-Wood s3-s4 South-Fire s2-s7 West-Metal s5-s6 Center-Earth s3-s8 South-Fire s7-s8 West-Metal s4-s9 North-Water s9-sl0 North-Water s5-sl0 Center-Earth In their standard positions, the stems succeed each other two by two in the order of their enumeration, from si to slO; the cycle of the Five Agents that results from this sequence is the generation cycle (sl-s2 generate s3-s4, and so on). In the transformed sequence (corresponding to the layout of the five unions), the stems make up two congruous sets, from si to s5 and from s6 to slO. The result is a coupling of the stems into five pairs defined by the agent that corresponds to the standard position of the odd-numbered stem (Wood for sl-s6, Fire for s3-s8, and so on). Not only is there a non-conquest relationship between the even and odd numbered stems of each pair, the non-conquest cycle also applies to the sequence from one pair to the next (sl-s6-Wood do not conquer s2-s7 Metal, and so on). The five unions play an important role in hemerology and calendar making, and are mentioned in the Taixuan jing M Ml (Book of great mystery) by Yang Xiong MM (53 b.c.-a.d. 18)." The sequence of sectors and agents in the five unions system corre sponds exactly to the annual movement of De in Xingde B. Thus, for a jiazi (nl, or sl-bl) year, it may be automatically deduced that Taiyin is in zi (bl) and De is in East-Wood. Conversely, when Taiyin is in wu (b7) and De is in West-Metal, the binom of the current year can only be gengwu (n7, or s7-b7).100 Xing Movement According to Five Agent Theory The Huainanzi provides two pieces of evidence regarding the move ment of Xing. Full explanation of their meaning reveals the basis for 99.

Since the stem and branch elements of the binoms are always of the same class (odd or even), the binom in question must be gengwu (s7-b7).</page><page sequence="45">MARC KALINOWSKI 169 calculating the annual movement of Xing in Xingde B. The first is in the passage translated above in which the twelve branches are divided into four groups of three according to the sequence in which they are born, mature, and die.101 It should be noted that the three branches in each group do not follow each other consecutively; thus, the agents assigned to them do not correspond to the standard positions on the four sides of the cord-hook diagram (Fig. 6). The groups of three are known as the Ho" "three unions": Standard Positions of the Branches Layout of the Three Unions bl2-bl-b2 (North-Water) bl-b5-b9 (Water) b3-b4-b5 (East-Wood) b2-b6-bl0 (Metal) b6-b7-b8 (South-Fire) b3-b7-bll (Fire) b9-b!0-bll (West-Metal) b4-b8-b!2 (Wood) The system of the three unions is also attested in the third century B.C. hemerological manuscripts from Shuihudi and Fangmatan Sfr flit, a fact that shows its importance at that time.102 The four groups of three are based on first dividing the twelve branches into three groups of four branches each, forming three cells: bl-b2-b3-b4, b5-b6-b7-b8, b9-bl0-bl l-bl2. The four branches in each cell represent four positions that correspond to the monthly movement of a calendrical spirit in the four sectors. In this connection, the four-fold cycle of Xing belongs to a larger body of hemerological procedures based on the combination of cycles of four and twelve that could be represented on the cord-hook diagrams.103 Traditional commentaries agree that the three unions make up a lay out based on the distribution of the twelve branches on the sides of the cord-hook diagram. In each group of three, the agent associated with the branch that corresponds to a cord, known as a zhuangchen "mature-branch," is identical to that of the standard branch-agent cor relations: zi (bl) for Water-North-Winter, mao (b4) for Wood-East-Spring, wu (b7) for Fire-South-Summer, and you (blO) for Metal-West-Autumn. The two other branches in each group belong to different sectors and agents. Following the sequence of Water (bl), Metal (blO), Fire (b7), Wood (b4), the shengchen "birth-branch" is the branch that comes imme 101.

Thus, the death-branch is always the branch immediately preceding the birth-branch of the following group. Here is the resulting pattern (the mature-branches are in italics): death b8 / \ bl2 birth East-Wood b7 / \ b3 birth bll death birth b6 \ I / South-Fire b2 death West-Metal death birth b5 b9 \ / bl North-Water The three branches in each group form a coherent ensemble that marks the positions of the three phases in the evolutive cycle of the agent rep resented by the mature-branch. For example, for Wood (East-Spring), there is birth on hai (bl2; N-NW hook, beginning of Winter), maturity on mao (b4; (E cord, middle of Spring), and death on wei (b8; S-SW hook, end of Summer).104 The system of the three unions is the basis for determining the an nual movement of Xing, but does not yield the positions of Xing with out a further transformation. This transformation is explained in the second piece of evidence from the Huainanzi, which concerns how the four agents associated with the three unions move to the agents that correspond to the annual movement of Xing: In the case of Xing, Water branches move to Wood, Wood branches move to Water, Metal and Fire (branches) stay in their (own) loca tion.105 This brief, precise statement has never been satisfactorily explained, either by the sexagenary cycle or by Five Agent theory, which is not lacking in ways of justifying just about any correlative schema. On the level of the Xing-De method, here is the result of the transfer 104. For this formulation of the three unions in the Wuxing dayi, see Kalinowski, Cosmologie et divination, 90-91 and 231-32. 105. See the Huainanzi passage cited in n. 97, which serves as the basis for the dis cussion of the three unions just above.</page><page sequence="47">MARC KALINOWSKI 171 mation proposed (the mature-branches are in italics, as are the two posi tions of Xing where a shift occurs): Three Unions Position of Xing M-b5-b9 Water East-Wood b2-b6-blO Metal West-Metal b3-b7-bll Fire South-Fire b4-b8-b!2 Wood North-Water Application of the Huainanzi rule results in the movement of Xing as described in Xingde B. In the case of the Metal and Fire branches, the position occupied by Xing is the same as that of the agent that corre sponds to them according to the three unions. In the case of the Wood and Water branches, the three unions positions are reversed. What might appear to be an anomalous procedure is no longer problematic once we realize that the logic of the Xing cycle is based on a uniform move ment on the four sides of the cord-hook diagram, a movement that Xing shares with De except for its bypassing the Central palace. It is evident that the Huainanzi does not set out a theory governing the movements of Xing, but rather that it describes a posteriori the relationship between the branch elements of the annual binoms and the positions of Xing as represented by Xing' s annual rotation in the four sectors (and associ ated agents) of the cord-hook diagram. The singularity of the Xing cycle has given rise to various formula tions of which the best known is that of Yi Feng's (first century b.c.) Yishi fengjiao M J3c III M, preserved in the Hanshu commentary of Meng Kang ]£lit (early third century a.d.). Two other formulations are found in a Daoist ritual treatise from the Six Dynasties period (the Shangcjing huangshu guodu yi _hfif Hrlr ilHSffl)/ and in the Wuxing dayi. The latter two formulations do not follow strictly the annual rotation of Xing: Yishi fengjiao: $£§§:£, #§§ Trees fall and return to their root; water flows and goes towards its end; metal is rigid and fire ardent—each returns to its sector.106 Huangshu guodu yi: zKMIf AMifc . •.

The Huangshu guodu yi and the Wuxing dayi formulations are considerably different, both in their meaning and in their uses.109 Later Changes in the Notation of the Xing-De Cycle One significant change in the Xing-De method was that the notation of their positions by sectors and/or agents was progressively replaced by a notation based on the ten stems and twelve branches. The lists of Virtues and Punishments from the Wuxing dayi presented above (p. 159) indicate that this evolution took place by converting references to the five sectors/agents into the stems and branches that are usually associ ated with these sectors/agents on the cord-hook diagram: the stem jia (si) and the branches yin (b3), mao (b4), and chen (b5) representing East Wood, and so on (see Fig. 6). The conversions for the annual movement of De and Xing are as follows: 107. Shangqing huangshu guodu yi (Daozang ilil, S1294; S designates the number assigned to the Daoist scriptures in K.M.

In any case, notation by stems and branches became customary during the Tang, as is shown by the almanac for 834 (Pelliot 2765). An examination of the sources treating the annual movements of Xing and De shows the complexity of the elements that come into play and their significance for hemerological practices in China. The Xingde texts from Mawangdui help us not only to understand better the position occupied by the Xing-De procedure in the Huainanzi astrological treatise, but also to trace its evolution from the end of the Warring States to the Tang dynasty, when the notation of the annual positions of Xing and De achieved its definitive form. Let me offer five general conclusions based on the analysis of the Xing-De procedure. (1) In the Mawangdui Xingde texts the annual rotation of Xing-De is inseparable from the sexagenary year count and the annual move ment of Taiyin. The positions of De are defined by the stem ele ments of the binoms and those of Xing, like Taiyin, by their branch elements. This is doubtless why the beginning of the Xing cycle is symbolically associated with that of Taiyin in the first paragraph of the part of Xingde B devoted to the Xing-De procedure. The positions of Xing and De that result from these calculations reveal 117. A Dunhuang Sfc'JSI manuscript: Pelliot 2765. 118. A Dunhuang manuscript: Stein 95. 119. See Zhang Peiyu, "Chutu Hanjian boshu shang de lizhu" Hi Ji M ffi ft iS h $7 MH, in Chutu wenxian yanjiu xuji ttj 3S|jt M (Beijing: Wenwu, 1989), 135-47.</page><page sequence="51">MARC KALINOWSKI 175 what the almanac tradition would later call the Virtue of the year (suide Hi!) and the Punishment of the year (suixing MM)', that is, the days and orientations that are propitious (or not propitious) for the starting of an enterprise. (2) This Xing-De method—which might be named more precisely Taiyin/Xing-De to distinguish it from another method also men tioned in the Huainanzi, the Xing-De qishe "seven dwellings of Xing-De"— should be seen in the larger context of practices that applied the sexagenary norm to the determination of astro calendrical cycles. As we have seen, there is a striking parallelism between the three periods of conjunction of Xing and De and the three cycles of completion (sanzhong) of the sun and moon that make up the Great Epoch cycle of the Quarter-day system. The connection is even more striking in that, in ancient texts, Virtue and Punishment are most often correlated with the sun and 124 moon. It is not by chance that the section of the Huainanzi that describes the annual rotation of Xing-De begins by presenting the movement of Taiyin as it relates to the Great Epoch cycle. This presentation includes, in addition to Xing-De, descriptions of the cycle of the five seasonal emblems in the twelve branches, the solar cycles of the twelve;ianchu "establishment and removal" spirits, and the Jupiter cycle. 120. Zhang Peiyu, "Chutu Hanjian boshu shang de lizhu." 121. On these hemerological functions, see Xieji bianfang shu, 3.6a-7b (suide) and 3.53a-54a (suixing). The use of the term suide is recorded in the Chu Silk Manuscript (see below, n. 175). The Yuejue shu Mlgir mentions it in opposition to Taiyin: "When Taiyin is in yang, suide is in yin." See Yuejue shu (Sibu beiyao ed.), 4.3a ("Ji Ni neijing" If )', and the fragments collected by Ma Guohan under the title Fanzi Jiran fij-p (Yuhan shanfangjiyi shu 3E@ill|Jf $Sftir [Taipei: Wenhai, 1967], vol. 5, 2557). 122.

Major, Heaven and Earth in Early Han Thought, 118-24, does not make these distinctions since he puts the entire passage under the aegis of Jupiter, translating Taiyin consistently as "Jovian cycle" (see above, n. 53). The subdivisions of the Huainanzi text are as follows (I use the line numbering estab lished by Major in his translation): Taiyin and the sexagenary Epoch cycle (section 32.1-9); the five seasonal emblems (section 32.10-15); thejianchu system (section 32.16 27); the Jovian year count (section 33.1-49); the annual rotation of Xing-De (section 34.1-13); technical descriptions on the keying of Xing-De and on the five seasonal emblems (section 34.14-33). Thejianchu system was widespread during the Qin and the Han periods, and constitutes the most prominent feature of the Shuihudi, Fangmatan, and Jiudian rishu manuscripts (see Liu Lexian, "Jiudian Chujian Rishu</page><page sequence="52">176 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI (3) The Five Agents doctrine holds a predominant position in the Xing-De method. It regulates the movements of Xing and De in the same way that the movement of the stars determines calendrical cycles. While recognizing that the relationship between the sexagenary cycles and the astronomical year is purely con ventional, we might say that the Five Agents give Xing and De not necessarily a physical reality but at least the dynamism needed for their rotations. On the one hand, this is done through the theory of their mutual non-conquest, which contributed at the same period to the cosmological reinterpretation of traditional historiography. ~ On the other hand, it comes about through cor relative arrangements like the five unions and the three unions, which serve to link the stem and branch elements of the sexagenary binoms with the cord-hook diagram. (4) Since the implementation of the Xing-De method presupposes the existence of correlations associated with the cord-hook dia gram, it appears that the method came into being after these cor relations were established. The presentation in the Huainanzi of the principles underlying the method tends to confirm this point. Ultimately, it was possible to deduce the positions of Xing and De on the basis of Five Agents theory without having recourse to the concept of a combination of cycles repeated four or five times in the five sectors. Yet, the question is more complex than it may appear. We have seen that the theory in the Huainanzi does not explain everything since the reversal of the East-Wood and North Water sectors, which controls the relationship between the twelve branches and the position of Xing, does not correspond to any known correlative schema. " If such a schema existed, the text would certainly have mentioned it. Thus, there are aspects of the Xing-De method that still elude us and, in my judgment, point to the existence of earlier practices, prior to the systematic application of Five Agent theory to sexagenary hemerology. The Mawangdui Xingde texts could represent a state of affairs closer to these ancient yanjiu," 64-66; and Kalinowski, "Les traites hemerologiques de Shuihudi," 197-99). We know for sure that the jianchu system is based on the cycle of twenty-four solar periods and that it has nothing to do with Jupiter (see Zhang Peiyu, "Chutu Hanjian boshu de lizhu," 136-37). The five seasonal emblems do not appear in the Xingde texts from Mawangdui, but they are found in those from Fuyang (see above, n. 17; and Hu Pingsheng "Fuyang Hanjian mulu" [unpublished paper presented at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Paris, May 1994]). 126. See above, p. 162 and n. 87. 127. See above, pp. 170-71.</page><page sequence="53">MARC KALINOWSKI 177 practices, a state in which the cord-hook diagram constituted the functional basis for the division of the calendar year among the five sectors. We unfortunately know too little about the forma tive period of pre-imperial diagrammatic cosmography to be able to know just when the stems and branches were associated with the cord-hook diagram or whether the Five Agents played any role in this process. (5) In any case, with the systematic application of correlative schemas from Five Agent theory to sexagenary hemerology, the properties of space and time attached to the cord-hook diagram were pro gressively assimilated to the stems and branches. Thus the rota tions of Xing and De came to be defined by the sexagenary signs themselves, as we see in Tang and later almanacs, and no longer by sectors/agents as in the Han texts. From that time on, the Xing De system took on a more general and abstract form that led to the appearance of the various kinds of Virtues and Punishments mentioned in the Wuxing dayi and in the Xieji bianfang shu. The Nine Palaces and the Daily Rotation of Xing-De The Diagram of the Nine Palaces The diagram to the right of the sexagenary grid on Xingde B (measur ing roughly 32 cm by 30 cm) represents the rotation of Xing and De as a function of days, an element not found on the sexagenary grid. The reconstruction in Fig. 13 is based on the photographic reproduction of Xingde B in Hanmu wenwu.n9 Despite lacunae due to rotted silk on the original manuscript, the arrangement of inscriptions in the various cells of the diagram follow identical principles of composition, and it has been easy to fill the gaps in the diagram. I have also referred to data from Xingde A mentioned by Chen Songchang in his articles. Note that the concentric circles in the central part of the diagram lack inscrip tions; the text inscribed there will be discussed presently. 128. This is why the passages about the Taiyin/Xing-De method in the Huainanzi cannot be understood without having before one the diagrams that controlled their movements. Major understood well the role played by such diagrams when he wrote: "Nevertheless the overall import of this section is clear enough; it has to do with day prognostication based on the movement of taiyin (counter-Jupiter) through the ce lestial circle represented by the cosmograph [that is, the liuren astrolabe] or some analo gous instrument with the stem-branch designation of days being the controlling fac tor" (Heaven and Earth in Early Han Thought, 125). 129. Hanmu wenwu, 135.</page><page sequence="54">178 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI Fig. 13. The nine palace diagram in Xingde B Let us examine the diagram. The two concentric circles at the center are divided in two by a horizontal line that also subdivides the outer circle into two groups of five cells, which are arranged on either side of the horizontal axis. This makes up the Central palace, called zhonggong H in Xingde B, part one, paragraph 3.4 (see below). Around the Central palace, and connected to it by straight lines, are eight square shapes. These are the eight peripheral palaces identified in the text by the direc tions to which they correspond. The palaces situated at the bottom (North), top (South), left (East), and right (West) are called zhenggong IE U "regular palaces." The other four, representing the intermediary posi tions (NE, SE, SW, and NW) are called jigong "odd palaces."130 The whole layout made up of the Central palace, the four regular palaces, 130. The concepts of zheng and ji are as widespread in ancient texts as are those of Xing and De. There is, for example, the famous passage from Laozi paragraph</page><page sequence="55">MARC KALINOWSKI 179 and the four odd palaces may be identified as the diagram traditionally known by the name jiugong tu A KM "nine palaces diagram." In this respect the Mawangdui Xingde texts provide the oldest example of such a diagram, one whose nine divisions are explicitly defined as "palaces."131 The structure of all the regular palaces is identical. Each includes ten cells with inscriptions arranged horseshoe-fashion around a cord-hook diagram. It is difficult to decide whether the cord-hook diagram had only a decorative function or whether its presence in this position had a practical purpose. For example, it could be that the diviner wrote here the positions of Taiyin, Xing, and De for the current year. The odd palaces follow the same pattern; each has ten cells of which two or three con tain no inscriptions. The agents that are usually correlated with the four sectors of space are written beneath the regular palaces, thus forming the standard lay out of the four sectors/agents (North-Water, East-Wood, South-Fire, West Metal). It should also be noted that the palaces are drawn in different colors: yellow for the Central palace, blue for the Eastern and South eastern palaces, red for the Southern and Southwestern palaces, white for the Western and Northwestern palaces, and black for the Northern and Northeastern palaces. Given the well-known correlations between the five colors and the Five Agents, the nine palaces diagram constitutes a diagram whose five compartments represent the five sectors/agents (Fig. 14).132 When the position occupied by Xing and De is specified by an agent with no indication of the name of the palace concerned, this may imply that De is found in the regular palace and Xing in the odd palace that corresponds to that agent (see the discussion of paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 below). The inscriptions on the diagram include, in addition to the sixty binoms, the names of the six spirits of the Xing-De method, the names of the spirits of the eight sectors, and indications of the winter and summer solstices. Let us examine these inscriptions, beginning with the six Xing De spirits. 57: "Use the regular to govern the state; use the odd to employ weapons" (JillEin IB, iii. of ffl It is worth noting that paragraph 57 also contains the only attack on the observance of taboos and prohibitions (jihui ) in the Laozi. When zheng and ji are applied to spatial divisions as is the case in Xingde B, zheng designates a frontal position and ji a sideways position; see Li Ling, Wu Sunzi fawei W. f 5! 65 (Beijing: Zhong hua, 1997), 64, n. 4. 131. See the text of paragraph 3.4 below. For the nine palace system on other exca vated artifacts, see above, n. 36. 132. See Chen Songchang, "Xingde liieshuo," 97. The use of colors to indicate ori entations on a diagram is still common in the astro-calendrical tradition.

They are associated with the sixty binoms and distributed in a uniform fashion in each of the nine palaces. In the odd palaces one finds Xing in place of Xing-De in the regular palaces.133 Fengbo (Lord of Winds), Yushi (Master of Rains), and Leigong (Prince of Thunder) are important deities in ancient Chinese religion; they rule the passing of time and influence atmospheric conditions.134 Fenglong (Luxuriant Dragon) is a spirit of a similar kind who is supposed to have the power to control thunder and rain. The Chuci ® if poem on journey ing in the spirit world, "Yuanyou" names Fenglong in association with Fengbo, Yushi, and Leigong.135 In connection with the diagram of the nine palaces, there is a significant reference to Fenglong in a Hanfeizi ff ^~P passage that mentions Fenglong along with other hemerological functions that are alike in being distributed over the four sectors and determining by their positions the good or bad outcome of wars: At the beginning, Wei §k battled for many years in the East and annexed the lands of Wei and Tao P®.

This does not show that the cycle of the five Fenglong agents, the periods of action and rest of Taiyi , the cycle of the six Sheti fltH spirits, and Wugua Eftj, Tianhe M, Yinqiang /jx-ftj, and Jupiter were not in the West dur ing earlier years. Nor does it indicate that Tianque 5^ ©I, Huni ® Xingxing fflj£, Mars, and Kuitai ig cJ were not in the East during subsequent years. I also say that... (the position of the spirits) on the left, on the right, in front, or behind does not suffice to deter mine (the outcome of) a battle. There is no greater stupidity than to put one's trust in this.136 There remains Dayin (Great Sound), about which little is known. In the Shiji, "Treatise on Celestial Offices" (tianguan shu ~-}i Hf U), Dayin is associated with the Tuntan MM year of the Jovian cycle. Jao Tsung-i speculates that Dayin could be simply a variant of Taiyin but he does not present adequate proof.137 To sum up, with the exception of the Hanfeizi, ancient texts make no mention of the use of Xing-De spirits in a divinatory context. Xingde B restores contemporary documentation of the astro-calendrical divina tion criticized in the Hanfeizi. With respect to the six Xing-De spirits, Xingde B, columns 29-30, establishes the following correlations among the six spirits, military officials, and the sixty binoms: mm, Generally, when using winds to prognosticate on matters associated with military officials, zi (bl) and wu (b7) days are Xing-De days and correspond to the general; chou (b2) and wei (b8) days are Feng long days and correspond to the officer in charge of works; yin (b3) and shen (b9) days are Fengbo days and correspond to the marshal; mao (b4) and you (blO) days are Dayin days and corre spond to the captain; chen (b5) and xu (bll) days are Leigong days 136.

For the events mentioned in the text, see Edouard Chavannes, Les memoires historiques de Se-Ma Ts'ien (Paris: Adrien-Maisonneuve, 1967), vol. 5,170-95; for the territories of Wei and Tao, see vol. 5, 139, n. 3. Han Fei is critical of hemerological procedures based on the presence or absence of calendrical spirits and atmospheric phenomena in one direction or another. Defining the positions of the spirits by using the terms in front of/behind (xianhou $t) and left/right (zuoyou tEti ) is also characteristic of Xingde B, which devotes a whole section to prognostications derived from fifteen different locations of Xing and De in relation to a strategic position (columns 23-28). For example: "When Xing and De are on the right, the battle will be won; when they are on the left, it will be half lost" (timmMm, 137.

This distribution can be verified on the diagram of the nine palaces, where each spirit actually does appear ten times (once in each of the eight sectors and twice in the central sector), always in association with the corresponding binoms: Xing-De zi (bl) and wu (b7) nl, n7, nl3, nl9, n25, n31, n37, n43, n49, n55 Fenglong chou (b2) and wei (b8) n2, n8, nl4, n20, n26, n32, n38, n44, n50, n56 Fengbo yin (b3) and shen (b9) n3, n9, nl5, n21, n27, n33, n39, n45, n51, n57 Dayin mao (b4) and you (blO) n4, nlO, nl6, n22, n28, n34, n40, n46, n52, n58 Leigong chen (b5) and xu (bll) n5, nil, nl7, n23, n29, n35, n41, n47, n53, n59 Yushi si (b6) and hai (bl2) n6, nl2, nl8, n24, n30, n36, n42, n48, n54, n60 The Spirits of the Eight Sectors In the regular palaces, the cells located to the right of the cord-hook diagrams mention four deities: they are none other than the sovereigns of the four sectors as identified in the yueling ji t3" "monthly ordinances" tradition.139 They also appear in the Wuxingzhan.

These binoms have the special feature that their stems and branches correspond to the same sectors/agents as the sovereigns with which they are aligned (East-Wood for yi and mao, South-Fire for bing and zvu, and so on). They play an important role in the Xing-De method, and in Xingde B are called root binoms (gen ®): mm. When De is in Wood, yimao (n52) is the root; when it is in Metal, xinyou (n58) is the root; when it is in Fire, bingwu (n43) is the root; when it is in Water renzi (n49) is the root; when it is in Earth, wuxu (n35) is the root.142 In the odd palaces, just below the six Xing-De spirits, in the middle cell of the third row of cells (the cells to either side are empty), there are also names of deities: Sheshi SSiS; in the Southwest, Yuqiang in the Northeast, and Qingze ftf # in both the Southeast and the North west.143 Jao Tsung-I identifies Sheshi with Sheti and Yuqiang with Yuqiang an identification that is all the more convincing given that the Huainanzi refers to them in connection with the eight winds: "Sheti is produced by the tiao (Northeast) wind.... Yuqiang is pro duced by the buzhou ^ /W| (Northwest) wind."144 These four spirits are also associated with binoms, which shows that they had specific hemero logical functions tied to the sexagenary calendar. The binoms dingwei (n44) for Sheti and guichou (n50) for Yuqiang are among the four-pole binoms (siji ES@) mentioned in the text of Xingde B.145 141. For the development of the yueling tradition, which was the basis for ideas about the cosmological organization of the state, see the recent study by Xing Yitian E0,"Yueling yu Xi-Han zhengzhi: cong Yinwan jibu zhong de'yi chun ling cheng hu' shuoqi" ft ga E ;M &amp; P M * » 4" W ^ f&amp; P IS IS, Xin shixue ff ££ 9.1 (1998), 1-54. 142.

The expression xiazhi datian is note worthy because it could be a variant of xiazhi shangtian "Sum mer Solstice, ascending to the sky" that is found on the Taiyi diviner's board dating from the early Han and found at Fuyang in 1977.146 It is hard to say why these inscriptions appear on the diagram of the nine palaces. Perhaps they are related to the rotations of Xing and De; we have seen above that they change position each year in the days follow ing the Winter Solstice.147 Finally, the bottommost cell of the odd palaces of the Northwest and Southeast have the following inscriptions: qiyun "vapors and clouds" in the Northwest; and sidou W| ||| "officer in charge of battles" in the Southwest. Qiyun also appears in Xingde A, but on the outer edge of the same palace. Sidou, which is associated with the stems bing (s3) and ding (s4), seems to designate a calendrical spirit involved in battles.148 The Central Palace The inscriptions in the Central palace in Xingde B can barely be seen.149 They are, on the other hand, perfectly clear in Xingde A. Although the Central palace in Xingde A is not divided into cells, the distribution of the inscriptions in two groups of six reveals an overall conception like that in Xingde B (Fig. 15). In the upper part of the circle the six Xing-De spirits appear, correlated with the six binoms from wuwu (n55) to guihai (n60). The De spirit and wuwu (n55) are placed by the South-Fire pal ace. In the lower part of the circle, the same six spirits appear correlated now with the six binoms from wuzi (n25) to guisi (n30). The Xing spirit and wuzi (n25) are by the North-Water palace. This layout is connected with the daily rotation of the Xing-De spirits through the nine palaces 146. See above, p. 14 and n. 36. On the Taiyi board the term associated with the Winter Solstice is yezhi B+S. The expression shangtian is also associated with the Sum mer Solstice in the En/a if ft, "Shitian ." See Yan Dunjie, "Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan," 385; and Jao Tsung-I, "Xingde yiben jiugongtu," 86. 147. See above, p. 138, n. 36; and pp. 163-64.

The latter, sixty in number, are directly involved in the diurnal Xing-De rotation. They are distributed among the nine palaces, six binoms for each of the palaces around the periphery (6x8 = 48) and twelve for the Central 150. See Chen Songchang, "Xingde liieshuo," 96.

The distribution of the sixty binoms in the nine palaces (left) and the stem/ branch combination of the first binom in each of the palaces (right) palace (48 + 12 = 60). The first six (nl to n6) appear in the odd palace of Wood (Southeast), in accord with the text of Xingde B already trans lated and discussed above.151 The distribution of the binoms proceeds from palace to palace according to the principle of the mutual non-con quest of the Five Agents, and alternating between regular and odd pal aces: odd-Wood, regular-Metal, odd-Fire, regular-Water, (odd) Center Earth, regular-Wood, odd-Metal, regular-Fire, odd-Water, (regular) Cen ter-Earth. This explains why the Central palace, for which the text does not distinguish a regular/odd division, contains twelve binoms instead of six (Fig. 16). The layout is carefully done since the sixty binoms are distributed in the palaces in such a way that the agent of the stem of the first binom/day of each group of six coincides with that of the palace where it is at that moment: jiazi (nl; jia = Wood) in the odd-Wood palace, gengwu (n7; geng = Metal) in the regular-Metal palace, and so on. In the same way, the branches of the first binoms/days are always zi (bl) or wu (b7), with the former in the odd palaces and the latter in the regular palaces (Fig. 16). The distribution of the six Xing-De spirits in the cells of the eight palaces around the periphery is almost the same for the odd and regular palaces (see Fig. 17; recall that each of the six spirits is correlated with two branches bearing the same agent, the first always occuring in odd palaces and the second in regular palaces). The binom of the first day in each palace, which corresponds to Xing-De (or Xing in the odd palaces) is always in the cells in the middle of the upper row. The other five days and spirits are distributed first on the right side for the second (Fenglong) and third (Fengbo) days, and on the left side for the fourth (Dayin), fifth (Leigong), and sixth (Yushi) days.

Still, the fact that the diagram in the first Shuihudi text (Rishu A) is not identical with that in the second (Rishu B) leads us to suspect a certain fluidity in their construction. 152. See Liu Lexian, Shuihudi Qinjian Rishu yanjiu, 282-83.</page><page sequence="64">188 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI Now that the various elements in the diagram of the nine palaces have been presented, we are ready to continue our close reading of the paragraphs that Xingde B devotes to the rotations of Xing and De.153 (3.3) For six days, Xing and De circulate jointly and each of them shifts to the non-conquest position. Xing circulates in the odd (palaces) on zi (bl) and unites with De in the regular (palaces) on wu (b7). That is why they unite on wu (b7) and separate on zi (bl). Paragraph 3.3 begins by defining the daily cycle of Xing-De. This cycle includes ten periods of six days. A different spirit corresponds to each day Xing and De rule the first day in each palace, which is always marked by the branches zi (bl) or wu (b7). The other spirits govern the following days in the order of the branches that are associated with them: chou (b2) and zvei (b8) for Fenglong, yin (b3) and shen (b9) for Fengbo, and so on (see above, p. 182). The text explicitly states that move ment through the nine palaces obeys the principle of non-conquest of the Five Agents, as can also be seen on the diagram. One special feature of Xing and De when compared with the other spirits is that they follow a double movement. During those periods whose first day is marked by the branch zi (bl), Xing occupies the odd palaces, while during the periods whose first day is marked by the branch wu (b7), it remains with De in the regular palaces. This is verified by the inscriptions on the diagram, since Xing appears alone in the cells of the odd palaces and together with De in the regular palaces (Fig. 13).154 (3.4) a , mmm, a a. wm n?, m# a s . # a a. wjii^a, tsr, a. nmrnT, &amp; a b . w&lt;m^, &amp; a b . jfj On wuzi (n25), Xing and De do not penetrate the Central palace and shift directly to the Eastern palace.

They both shift to gengwu (n7) and each of them 153. Starting with paragraph 3.3. See pp. 163-66, for the detailed treatment of the text preceding 3.3. 154.

(Then) Xing shifts to bingzi (nl3), De shifts to bingwu (n43), and each of them stays there six days. (Then) they both shift to renwu (nl9), six days each. (Then) Xing and De do not penetrate (the Central palace) and shift directly to jiawu (n31), twelve days each. (Then) Xing shifts to gengzi (n37), De shifts to gengwu (n7), six days each. (Then) Xing shifts to renzi (n49), De shifts to renwu (nl9), six days each. (Then) De shifts to wuwu (n55); Xing does not penetrate the Central palace and shifts directly to jiazi (nl). De stays in the Center six days and shifts to jiawu (n31). [Xing continues to rely on jia]zi (nl) for [twelve] days. De stays in jiaivu (n31) for six days. (Then) they join together and once again shift to gengzi (n7). In battles, one should wish to have them behind [or on the right side, never in front or on the left side.] The first two sentences provide data concerning the positions of Xing and De during the two periods of the Earth agent, from wuzi (n25) to guisi (n30) and from wuwu (n55) to guihai (n60). During the first period, both skip the Central palace to occupy the following palace (regular Wood-East), while during the second, De penetrates the Central palace but Xing moves directly to the following palace (odd-Wood-Southeast). It is striking that the Central palace in the Xingde A diagram identifies Xing among the spirits present in this palace during the twelve days in question (Fig. 15). Whatever the case may be, the remainder of the Xingde B text, which describes the movement of Xing and De in relation to the sixty binoms, confirms what is said at the outset. Their comings and goings in the nine palaces may be represented in a table (Fig. 19). Except for the irregularities caused by the movements within the Central palace, the cycle is relatively simple. It is interesting to see that the position of Xing in a given palace always corresponds to the binom of the day writ ten there, while this is not the case for De which for half of the time during its cycle stops in a palace where it corresponds to a binom that differs from the day binom. For example, on the day jiazi (nl) De is in the Eastern palace with the binom jiawu (n31). As a result, only the movement of Xing follows the natural sequence of the sixty binoms. Still, even when Xing and De occupy different palaces, the agents cor responding to these palaces are identical (see the last row in Fig. 19).155 155. This is, at least, the situation in theory. Yet we have evidence that things were different in practice. In Xingde A, the table of the daily cycle of Xing-De for the eleventh year of Gaozu always places De in the west when it moves independently of Xing; that is, from nl to n6, from nl3 to nl8, and so on (see the discussion below and n. 156). This variation seems to be connected to the fact that the annual position of De for the year in question, yisi (n42; 196 B.C.) was to be found in the West (see the sexagenary grid in Fig. 3).

The daily cycle of Xing and De according to Xingde B</page><page sequence="67">MARC KALINOWSKI 191 To sum up, the daily rotation of Xing-De is characterized by the move ment of a series of six calendrical spirits within a layout consisting of nine positions (the palaces), in coordination with the sequence of day binoms. The result is a constantly recurring cycle made up of ten periods of six days during which Xing and De change position among the palaces once. The complexity of the cycle lies in the number of variables that come into play. The distribution of the sixty binoms among the nine palaces, the rules for moving through the Central palace, the correlations between the six spirits and the twelve branches, the grouping of palaces into odd and regular in a layout with five basic positions which ensures the dynamism of the system by means of the theory of the Five Agents— all these are variables whose detailed analysis goes beyond the frame work of the present article. While the presentation of the daily rotation of Xing-De in Xingde B is quite detailed, the manuscript gives no information on how this daily cycle is to be combined with the calendar year. The publication of Xingde A will no doubt shed light on this point since it includes a table giving the positions occupied by Xing and De during the eleventh year of Han Gaozu, yisi (n42; 196 B.C.). The differences from the theoretical descrip tion presented above show that there was a definite connection between their annual and daily rotations. Here is the text for the first column of the table:156 Eleventh year, twelfth month. Jihai (n36) was the shangshuo day. Xing and De took position together in the Western palace on the gengzi (n37) day of their cycle. Note that the daily rotation of Xing-De took effect that year during the days between the Winter Solstice and the Beginning of Spring, which brings us back to the two periods of the solar year that govern the annual movement of Xing-De as well as that of Taiyin. Further, the day that marked the beginning of the cycle, gengzi (n37), is found to be the day after the jihai (n36) day, defined as shangshuo h$J "higher conjunction."157 156. See also, n. 155. The table is drawn beneath the sexagenary grid at the begin ning of Xingde A (see Kalinowski, " Xingde shitan," 97 and fig. 20). Because Xingde A has not been published, I limit myself to reproducing only the first column, which gives the exact date of the beginning of the cycle for the eleventh year of Gaozu. 157. According to the chronological tables of Zhang Peiyu, Sanqian wubai tiiati liri tianxiang 515 0 3^ jfe (n.p.: Henan jiaoyu, 1990), the first day of the twelfth month of the eleventh year of Gaozu was wuzi (n25; January 21).The shangshuo day, jihai (n36; February 1), was the twelfth day of this month. The daily cycle of Xing-De began the next day, on gengzi (n37; February 2), seven days before the Beginning of Spring on the nineteenth day, bingwu (n43; February 8).</page><page sequence="68">192 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI The shangshuo is an important hemerological element in the Chinese calendar. It is mentioned in the Lunheng mW of Wang Chong3L?E (a.d. 27-ca. 100).158 According to the astro-calendrical treatise in the Weishu St(i and later works like the Xieji bianfang shu, the shangshuo day is determined from the stem element of the binom for the year and it always corresponds to one of the ten days marked by the branches si (b6) or hai (bl2), as corroborated in Xingde A.159 Since these ten binoms precede by one day the binoms that mark the changes of position of Xing, on the five zi (bl) days, and De, on the five wu (b7) days, the con nection between the hemerological function of shangshuo and the daily rotation of Xing-De appears certain—all the more so since one of the fragments of Yinyang wuxing A published in Hanmu wenwu contains a list of shangshuo days laid out in groups of six binoms just as in the Xing-De procedure.160 Even more interesting is the fact that the determination of the shang shuo days in Yinyang wuxing A is directly related to another calendrical spirit named Tianyi (Celestial One): "Where the Celestial One re sides, there is found the higher conjunction" (^—jgj That is, the daily rotation of Xing-De is connected with the shangshuo days, which are in turn dependent on the position occupied by Tianyi. It would appear that Tianyi plays the same role in this context as does Taiyin in the annual Xing-De rotation. The Huainanzi further considers Tianyi and Taiyi to be "the most venerable of the celestial spirits."162 Further proof of the interdependence of contemporary hemerological systems is provided by a second fragment of Yinyang wuxing A repro duced in Hanmu wenwu. It shows a square diagram with Tianyi at the center and, on the sides, twenty-eight entities that serve hemerological functions, including Xing and De.163 Unfortunately we do not know how the Tianyi system worked; yet we know from several passages in the Huainanzi that Tianyi occupied an important place in Han calendrical astrology.

The Xing-De method was not transmitted as such to posterity. Some of its aspects have obviously influenced later man tic practices. We have seen that the annual Xing-De rotation lay behind many sorts of Xing and De spirits which emerged at the end of the Han and during the Six Dynasties periods. In contrast, their daily rotation does not seem to have left any noticeable traces. Many connections with previously known methods can nevertheless be made—at least hypothetically. One thinks, for example, of the compass system known as fengjiao IB, fin as it was practiced during the Han.164 It is in fragments of the lost Yishi fengjiao M^Mtfil of Yi Feng (first century B.C.) that we find formulas explaining the distribution of the Punishments in the twelve branches.165 Accord ing to this method, the twelve branches were associated with six hemerological functions (the liuqing /VlW) whose use was very close to that of the six Xing-De spirits in Xingde B.166 Compare the following passages from Xingde B and the Yisi zhan: Xingde B: When the clouds appear on the Fengbo (day) and by the Xing-De (day) there still is no rain, irregularities will arise during the year and storms will ravage the harvests.167 Yisi zhan: 0 On the Tanlang day at the Jianxie hour, if a wind arises coming from the Yinzei position, there will be pillaging and people will kill each other.168 One also thinks of the tradition of the "three models"—methods of astro-calendrical divination associated with Taiyi , dunjia jJ rp, and liuren /\3r- These divinatory techniques share with the Xing-De method their use of schematic representations of time and space on which are placed spirits that function as determiners of the propitious or unpropi tious nature of years, months, days, and hours. Another feature of these 164. On this method, with mostly military applications, see Li Chunfeng Yisizhan Z&lt; E da (Congshu jicheng ed.), 10.169-217.

Yisizhan, 10.186.</page><page sequence="70">194 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI techniques is that they were practiced with the aid of instruments called shi fit "astrolabe, diviner's board." Recent archaeological discoveries have proved the existence of liuren astrolabes and Taiyi boards as early as the beginning of the Han.169 We have already seen how their design shared in the symbolic universe of the cord-hook diagrams. The origin of the dunjia method remains unclear.170 However, the Mawangdui Xingde texts provide some clues. First, in the Six Dynasties and the Tang periods, the "three models" were sometimes referred to as "Taiyi, Leigong ff'ix, liuren" and not "Taiyi, dunjia, liuren."™ Simi larly, in the Tang period Taibo yinjing E=l HI?IS, the dunjia method is called Tianyi dunjiashi — M F:P it "method of the circulation of the Celestial One through the sexagenary signs": The Yellow Lord accepted the talisman and prostrated himself twice. Then he installed the nine palaces, set up the eight doorways, distributed the three anomalies and the six rules, and put together the yin and yang cycles that formed 1800 different arrangements. He gave (to this method) the name of "method of the circulation of the Celestial One through the sexagenary signs.172 Yet neither Leigong nor Tianyi are among the calendrical spirits firmly associated with the dunjia method in the later sources. In contrast, Tianyi plays a central role in the methods described in the Mawangdui Yinyang wuxing A, and Leigong is one of the six spirits that circulates in the nine palaces along with Xing and De in Xingde B. The Xing-De and dunjia methods share some technical characteristics. Both were practiced using a nine-division layout (the nine palaces). In both layouts the sixty binoms and their spirits were distributed accord ing to a fixed pattern. Both systems were based on a division of the year into two periods determined by the solstices and by the combining of two interconnected cycles (the great and small rotations). Finally, terms pecular to dunjia—such as the sanqi Hitf "three anomalies"—are also found in Xingde B with a similar meaning.173 169. See above, nn. 36-37. 170. The most ancient account of the dunjia method is in the Taibo yinjing attributed to Li Quan (mid eighth century). See Taibo yinjing (Mohai jinhu ed.), 9.1a-15b. The dunjia method is mentioned by Ge Hong Sift (ca. 280-340) in the Baopuzi (Xin zhuzi jicheng ed.), "Dengshe" 78.

They should be noted, however, if only to show that even though the Xing De method is not directly related to the dunjia procedures, it nonetheless shows the distinctive features of the divination systems associated with the tradition of the "three models" during the Six Dynasties and Tang periods. Conclusion Much remains to be said about the Mawangdui Xingde texts for which I have presented only the most revealing aspects as regards astro calendrical practices at the end of the Warring States and the beginning of the Han. The expected publication of other documents that treat of the Xing-De method will doubtless resolve many points that remain obscure. But we can already see that their value is comparable to that of the Shuihudi rishu manuscripts, or the Shashi manuscript on the opera tion of liuren astrolabes. In addition, the application of the prognostica tions to military affairs connects these texts with other Mawangdui texts sharing this peculiarity, for example the Tianwen qixiang zazhan and the Wuxingzhan. At present, these are the oldest texts belonging to the yin yang current of the arts of war (bingyinyang Jx|5§£|y§); prior to the manu script discoveries we have known of their existence solely from accounts reported in contemporary historical novels or through occasional criti cism in treatises on military strategy like the Sunzi bingfa Notions concerning Xing and De were rooted in the religious tradi tions of the Zhou period and formed part of a long evolution of concepts of the divine in the sense of an impersonal power manifesting itself in the world through natural cycles. Hence Xing and De came to occupy a prominent place in the cosmological speculations of intellectual move ments in the fourth and third centuries B.C. They are associated with the basic dualities underlying this cosmology—heaven and earth, sun and moon, yin and yang—with the function of revealing the propitious or unpropitious modalities inherent in natural processes. The Mawang dui Xingde texts show that the adaptation of these ideas to calendrical astrology was already an established fact at the beginning of the second century B.C., and certainly long before that if one takes into consideration the complexity of the elements which make up the Xing-De method. Mentions of De in the Chu Silk Manuscript suggest that the hemero 174. See, for example, Sunzi bingfa (Xin zhuzi jicheng ed.), "Xushi" (jj| K , 103. Many examples of calendrical divination in a military context are reported in the Yuejue shu .810 2t and the Wu Yuechunqiu see Donald Harper, "The Han Cosmic Board: A Response to Christopher Cullen," Early China 6 (1980-1981), 53-54.</page><page sequence="72">196 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI logical use of De is not later than the end of the fourth century B.C.175 In this connection, the affinities between the Xing-De method and Zou Yan's fHftj theory of dynastic successions, as well as the presence of the sovereigns of the four sectors of the yueling tradition (Taihao, Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Yandi) in the diagram of the nine palaces, confirm the tight ness of the bonds uniting astro-calendrical techniques with specula tions on the ritual and doctrinal foundations of imperial rule. The wide diffusion of the Xing-De method at this time is confirmed by the Huainanzi astrological treatise which describes it in great detail. This treatise is immensely important in the study of calendrical astrology in China, and the recent translation by John Major has demonstrated just how significant it is. There is almost no divinatory manuscript from the Warring States or early Han periods that is not in one way or another connected to it. The number of these manuscripts and their great age both indicate that they constituted the sources from which the various sections of the Huainanzi treatise were put together in a synthetic way that makes the treatise very difficult to read. The Mawangdui Xingde texts give us valuable help in finding our way through the mosaic of beliefs and practices that went into its composition. First, they elucidate the very nature of the Xing-De method and estab lish the place it occupies among the astro-calendrical techniques of the time, whether they are based on ideas of Xing and De as in the procedure of the "seven dwellings of Xing-De" (Xing-De qishe) or on analogous ideas. The method, as described by the Xingde texts, rests on the combi nation of three elements: first, the sexagenary cycle as a system of des ignating days and, surprising for that early period, also years; second, the spatial distribution of the five sectors and Five Agents to which are allocated the stem and branch elements of the sixty binoms; and third, the calendrical spirits who shift location on this layout according to the binoms associated with days and years, thus giving the positions they occupy mantic values that the hemerologists used to establish predictions. In their daily rotation, Xing and De move along with five other spirits 175. The term suide (Virtue of the year) occurs several times in the text; see Li Ling, Changsha Zidanku Zhanguo Chu boshu yanjiu (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1985), 57. De also appears in combination with ni If "concealed." Li Ling interprets ni as an antonym of De that prefigures the idea of Xing (Punishment; Chu boshu yanjiu, 57-58). For opposing opinions, see Jao Tsung-I, Chu boshu Jjl ^ (Hong Kong: Zhonghua, 1985), 52-53; and Zheng Gang, "Chu boshu zhong de suixing jinian he suixing zhan" Jianbo yanjiu 2 (1996), 59-68.

Evidence from the published fragments of Yinyang wuxing A reveal that the beginning of the cycle was connected with Tianyi, whose function in contemporary hemerology was well-established. The annual rotation, less complicated than the daily rotation, follows the same principles. Xing and De shift from one sector/agent to another in accordance with the branch elements (for Xing) and the stem elements (for De) of the year binoms. Their motions are combined with those of Taiyin and form a cycle made up of three periods of twenty years. What we learn from the Wuxingzhan and the Huainanzi about the an nual movement of Taiyin leads to the conclusion that the Xing-De method was formulated at a time when the sexagenary cycle began to be applied to the naming of the years and, more broadly, to the systemati zation of luni-solar conjunction cycles on the basis of the Quarter-day system. Specialists agree that the calculations of planetary ephemerides in the Wuxingzhan are based on observations made in the years 230-220 b.c. in connection with the formulation of the Zhuanxu calendar (Zhuan xu li StJf!®).177 Given the references to the Taiyin sexagenary year-count in the Wuxing zhan, we may suppose that the Xing-De method already existed at that time. The upper limit of dating is harder to determine since we know almost nothing about calendrical theories before the Zhuanxu system, but it is unlikely that it can be much earlier than the second half of the third century B.C.178 176. This cycle of ten six-day periods also reminds us of the cycle of thirty periods of twelve days described in the yin-yang texts from Yinqueshan. There each twelve day period is divided into two nodes (jie 05) of six days: "twelve days is a period; six days is a node" ([+] [El —0# , 7\ B —@5; slip 3258). In addition, the hemerological functions associated with the nodes are sheng ^ "vitality" and xing ff'J "punishment." See Yates, "The Yin-Yang Texts from Yinqueshan," 106. 177. Various dates for the formulation of the Zhuanxu system have been proposed, from 246 to 238 b.c. Since, in this system, the beginning of the Epoch cycle is set at the Beginning of Spring of 366 B.C. (a yimao year), it is thought that it was during the 120 years between this date and the first year of the First Emperor (246 B.C., also a yimao year)—that is, two complete sexagenary cycles—that Jovian astrology was progres sively blended with the sexagenary year-count. I think that the Mawangdui Xingde texts correspond to an already well-advanced stage in the process of assimilation (see the discussion of Taiyin and the Jovian year count on pp. 148-54 above). For studies on the formulation of the Zhuanxu calendar in relation to recent discoveries, see the refer ences cited in n. 67. See also Cullen, Astronomy and Mathematics in Ancient China, 27-28. 178. On the basis of the territorial and administrative divisions mentioned in the</page><page sequence="74">198 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI Next, the two diagrams that accompany the text of the Xing-De part of Xingde B are, in themselves, invaluable evidence for the study of the earliest diagrammatic representations in Chinese calendrical astrology. Their interest lies above all in the fact that they appear here in a precise context that lets us interpret their structure in connection with the spe cific uses being made of them. Conceived on the model of the world based on traditional divisions of space into directional sectors and of time into cyclical periods, the diagrams can be termed "topograms" in the sense that their main function is to indicate positions (topos).179 What ever heavenly or earthly phenomena could be transposed into these diagrams, their positioning goes along with their combination with the sexagenary cycle through the stem and branch elements of the sixty binoms. In the Xing-De method, the perfect homogeneity of the move ment of calendrical spirits on the cord-hook diagram shows that it was the instrumental support on which their movements were coordinated with each other. This form of representation was not devised simply to illustrate a pre-established theory, but constituted a cosmographic model based on representations of space and time inherited from more ancient astro-calendrical traditions. It is noteworthy that the first reproduction of a motif that shows all the features of the cord-hook diagram appears on the cover of a chest from the fifth century B.C., part of an ensemble of burial goods that includes another chest-cover with the oldest mention of the twenty-eight celestial lodges, recorded in a design that recalls the configuration of the liuren astrolabes.180 Given its simplicity of design and its wide diffusion in the most varied contexts (from liubo game boards, to sundials, to Han TLV mirrors), the cord-hook diagram could well be the functional nucleus around which gathered the various ele ments that characterize pre-imperial calendrical cosmography. The second diagram in Xingde B is of no less interest since it constitutes the earliest known representation of the famous diagram of the nine palaces. Unlike later representations in the form of a square divided into nine equal cells, the diagram here consists of a central circle from which radiate lines connected to the eight sectors of the world, repre meteoromantic part of Xingde B, Liu Lexian sees the compilation of this part of the manuscript as dating to sometime between 304 and 284 b.c. ("Mawangdui Hanmu xingzhan shu chutan,"120). Since we do not know when the two parts of Xingde B were first joined as a single compilation, this dating is not decisive for the part de voted to the Xing-De method. 179. On the concept of position in early Chinese calendrical astrology, see Marc Kalinowski, "Astrologie calendaire et calcul de position dans la Chine ancienne: Les mutations de l'hemerologie sexagesimal entre le IVe et le He siecle avant notre ere," Extreme-Orient Extreme-Occident 18 (1996), 71-113. 180.

This star-shaped layout seems to be characteristic of the contemporary form of representing the nine palaces since it is also found on the Taiyi diviner's board from Fuyang, which (we may re member) has a cord-hook diagram on its back side. Although the Taiyi board is much more schematic than the nine palace diagram in Xingde B, the former's connection with the tradition of the nine palaces is even more certain in that the nine positions are identified by the numbers one to nine in the arrangement typical of the magic square of three.181 Finally, the Mawangdui Xingde texts shed light on certain aspects of the later development of divinatory practices in China. They provide the first evidence of the use of calendrical spirits as hemerological func tions that determine the setting of seasonal prescriptions and directional prohibitions in almanacs, both in China and in cultures under Chinese influence.182 Comparison of the system of annual positioning of Xing and De in these texts, in the Huainanzi, and in later sources like the Wuxing dayi and the Xieji bianfang shu, shows an evolution leading towards the disappearance of topograms as functional supports for plot ting their movement. The properties of space and time that were at tached to these topograms have been allocated to the stems and branches whose relationship with Virtues and Punishments was from that time on understood independently of their periodic rotation in the five sec tors/agents. This is why the non-conquest cycle that establishes the dy namism of the annual movement of Xing and De on the cord-hook dia gram is no longer mentioned by the author of the Wuxing dayi. For him, the Xing-De relationship is understood as the simple exchange of at tributes among the ten stems and the twelve branches, and the more general cycle of mutual conquest is thus sufficient to explain them. It was also at this time that the recording of the positions of Xing and De by means of the five sectors/agents typical of the Han period was re placed by an exclusively sexagenary recording system. When it comes to the diurnal aspect of Xing-De rotations, it is more difficult to find any trace of them in the received literature. The six spirits associated with the day-branches may nonetheless be compared with analogous series used in thefengjiao compass method, which also had military applica tions. Similarly, connections may be made with the dunjia method, about which almost nothing is known before the Baopuzi of Ge Hong (ca. 280-340).183 181. See above, p. 14 and n. 36. 182.

Unfortunately, the articles do not include reproductions of any part of the original manuscripts to accompany his revelations. In addition, an article by Li Ling concerns, in part, Xingde B. I offer a synop sis of the three articles below, limiting myself to the new evidence that they provide for our knowledge of the Xingde manuscripts. Overall, the corrections to be made to the present article are minimal, and are indicated at the appropriate place in the notes with cross-reference to this addendum: 1. Li Ling ^ 55, "Du jizhong chutu faxian de xuanze lei gushu" M Hanbo yanjiu 3 (1998), 96 104. In a short passage describing Xingde B (pp. 100-101), Li Ling mainly discusses the identifications of the names of the spirits of the eight sectors and the inscriptions concerning the solstices. The single new interpretation to be added to what has been stated by Jao Tsung-I and Chen Songchang is Li Ling's speculation that the expressions beichangit H and datian Aare contractions: he inter prets the former as a contraction of beidou and wenchang SC H, and the latter as a contraction of taiyi — and tianyi ^—. 2. Chen Songchang Pllf&amp;JI/'Boshu Xingdebingpianshitan" fg P?MISM, Jianbo yanjiu 3 (1998), 242-47. Chen Songchang takes up again the question of Xingde C. Con trary to what Chen stated in earlier publications (see p. 128 and n. 15 of the present article), the manuscript assigned the title Xingde C, which is composed of eighteen severely damaged fragments, does not fit into the same tradition of texts as Xingde A and Xingde B. Rather, it should be associated with the two Mawangdui manu scripts assigned the title Yinyangwuxing |sl[»|§£fj- Like the latter, it includes material that treats of the Xing-De method, but the overall conception of the manuscript is quite different from Xingde A and Xingde B.

It is useful for providing some new details and for confirming information introduced in my own article based on observations that I made of the original manuscripts in 1992 (see above, n. 1). I note the following major points: a. Table of the Sixty Binoms: The table of the sixty binoms from Xingde A appears on p. 80, and does not differ from the Xingde B table except for the reign year notations as already discussed in my article (see above, p. 145). On p. 77, Chen also provides the complete text of the inscription to the left of the table in Xingde A. The first part, concerning the annual movement of Taiyin is already transcribed in my article (see above, p. 146). The second part is interesting because it could explain why the positions occupied by Xing on the sexagenary grid are not visible on the reproduction of the Xingde B table in Hanmu wenwu (see above, p. 162 and n. 88): "The black dots represent De, the white dots represent [Xing?]" M^Htil E=J Ij [ffij?] til- Based on this inscription, Chen re-exam ined the original manuscripts and discovered that the black dots representing the yearly position of Taiyin have in their middle a smaller white dot. Chen concludes that the positions of Xing were not noted separately from the positions of Taiyin, and that they followed the cycle indicated in the second passage of Xingde B translated and discussed above, p. 163. Chen's discovery does not entirely resolve questions concerning the representation of Xing in the Xingde B table; and, in any case, it does not change any thing concerning the annual movement of Xing because we have seen that its shift from one sector to another depended precisely on the annual shift of Taiyin following the sequence of the twelve branches. On the contrary, this adds further evidence demonstrat ing the direct connections between the Taiyin cycle and that of Xing and De (see the first two of the five general conclusions given above, pp. 174-75). b. Nine Palaces Diagram: Re-drawings of the diagrams of the nine palaces in Xingde A and Xingde B are given on pp. 77-78. Chen's drawing of the Xingde B diagram is virtually identical to mine (see above, Fig. 13). However, there are two errors in his identification of binoms: yihai (nl2) instead of jihai (n36) in the East palace, and jiyou SIS (n46) instead otyiyou Zi® (n22) in the North palace. In the inscription concerning the summer solstice, Chen transcribes shangtian ii^C, which instead should read datian (as transcribed by Li Ling).</page><page sequence="78">202 THE XINGDE TEXTS FROM MAWANGDUI Chen's rendering of the Central palace in Xingde A is similar to mine (see above, Fig. 15). There are several differences in the binoms. The most notable difference concerns the graphs xinmao dayin , which I place next to the Northeast palace while Chen places them next to the East palace. c. Other Transcriptions: Chen transcribes the passage from Xingde A concerning the five root binoms, which confirms the error in the binom that I noted in the corresponding passage in Xingde B (see above, p. 183 and n. 142). Chen also provides a full transcription of the long passage on the daily rotation of Xing-De during the eleventh year of Han Gaozu (196 B.C.), of which I re produce the first column (see above, p. 191 and n. 156). Chen's comparison of the two versions of the daily rotation of Xing-De leads him to the same conclusions as mine: that Xingde A describes the cycle as it applied specifically to the eleventh year of Gaozu, whereas Xingde B explains it in a more general and theoretical way.
