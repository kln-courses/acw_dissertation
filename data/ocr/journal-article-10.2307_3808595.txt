VERME, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Shingleton, MI 49884 Abstract: Literature on deer (Odocoileus) reproduction was reviewed to elucidate the relationship between a doe's nutritional state when bred and sex of progeny conceived. Available data revealed a correlation (P &lt; 0.01) between progeny sex ratio and fecundity rate of does older than 1 year. Percentage of male fawns progressively declined with increasing maternal age and litter size. These findings support the hypothesis that undernourished does tend to produce a surplus of males, whereas more females are born to mothers in good vigor at estrus. Population characteristics and biosocial factors also influence sex ratio outcome, however. The theoretical aspects of sex ratio variation and its herd management implications are discussed. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 47(3):573-582 The vital role of nutrition in modifying the fecundity of wild cervids has been amply documented. Additionally, I re- ported that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in poor nutritional state when bred conceived a disproportionate num- ber of male fawns, whereas well-fed mothers had more females (Verme 1965, 1969). Since then, results from other stud- ies have confirmed this relationship (Rob- inette et al. 1977, McCullough 1979, Verme and Ozoga 1981), but some work- ers have concluded that their data contra- dicted it (Mansell 1974, Woolf and Har- der 1979). Given the disparate nature of these investigations and sampling con- straints, such equivocation is hardly sur- prising. In an effort to resolve this dilem- ma, I reviewed the published records on secondary (in utero or natal) sex ratio for the genus Odocoileus to ascertain whether the data exhibited a nutritionally related trend, and to delineate innate factors or common denominators, prompting devia- tions from the theoretical 50:50 value. Al- though sex ratio alteration is of special in- terest because of its evolutionary or adaptive significance (Trivers and Willard 1973, Myers 1978, Clutton-Brock et al. 1981), this phenomenon doubtless influ- ences a species' population dynamics and thus has important implications in terms of herd welfare and management (Mc- Cullough 1979, Verme and Ozoga 1981, Ozoga and Verme 1982). This paper presents the results of this endeavor. It is a contribution from Mich- igan Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Project W-117-R and the Cusino Wildlife Research Station. I thank D. R.

METHODS I reviewed the literature on deer repro- duction for data relating doe fecundity to progeny sex ratio; unpublished reports were not surveyed. Insofar as possible, gross fecundity (mean fawns per doe) and maternal rates (offspring per pregnancy) were computed separately for all adults (&gt;1 year old) in a given study. Due to differences in procedures and manner of data presentation among studies, calcula- tion of gross fecundity rate sometimes was based on ovarian analysis (e.g., Laramie and Silver 1968) rather than on actual fe- tal counts or births. To simplify analysis, I combined data subsets in reports where the sample sizes were small and/or the differences did not seem wide enough to warrant separate listing (e.g., Severing- haus and Tanck 1964, Robinette et al. 1973, Harder and Peterle 1974, Dapson et al. 1979).

Age designation for animals older than year- lings probably was not precise when based on dental criteria, the standard procedure. Even with known-age deer, sampling con- straints necessitated pooling progeny sex ratios into broad maternal age-classes at conception, such as prime age (2.5-7.5 years old) or 2.5+ years (Verme 1965, 1969; Robinette et al. 1973; Ozoga and Verme 1982). Despite these shortcomings, the results should accurately portray the reproductive characteristics for the genus. RESULTS I compiled the data for white-tailed deer separately from those for mule and black- tailed deer (0. hemionus, 0. h. columbi- anus) (Table 1). However, reproductive differences between the species were mi- nor (e.g., fecundity averaged 1.76 vs. 1.65/ mother, with 50.9 vs. 51.6% male prog- eny, respectively). Linear regression of the combined data sets revealed a negative correlation (r = -0.58, P &lt; 0.01) between gross doe fecundity and percentage of male fawns (Fig. 1). The resulting equa- tion, Y = 75.58 - 15.55X, predicts an even secondary sex ratio at a gross fecundity of 1.64/adult doe. This relationship was somewhat weaker (r = -0.48, P &lt; 0.01) with regard to maternal fecundity rate. However, both regressions were appreci- ably influenced by the anomalous data re- ported by Nixon (1971) and Haugen (1975). Residual analysis tests of the data indicated that the regression results were not biased by differences in sample sizes among the different studies.

Reproductive records for doe fawns re- vealed that this age-class consistently bore a preponderance (62.5%) of male progeny (Table 2). This ratio differed (x2 test, P &lt; 0.01) from that exhibited by older moth- ers. The progeny sex ratio for yearling does did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) from that of prime-age animals, 52.6 vs. 50.2% males, respectively. However, these results were influenced by the low production of male progeny (36.9%) among pen-bred year- lings (Haugen and Davenport 1950; Gol- ley 1957; Haugen 1959; Adams 1960; Severinghaus and Tanck 1964; Verme 1965, 1969; Robinette et al. 1973), com- pared with the ratio (55.6% males) for does mating in the wild or in large enclosures (P &lt; 0.01). Based on limited data (mainly from Robinette et al. 1957), old (8.5+ years) does conceived a surplus of male fawns (53.6%).

Males com- prised 46.4% of the few quadruplet spec- imens. It is pertinent that when prime-age does conceived multiple litters, 46.4% of the progeny were males vs. 56.8% in sin- gletons (P &lt; 0.05). DISCUSSION The tendency for a progressive decline in proportion of male progeny coincident with increasing fecundity rate, maternal age, and litter size noted in this analysis supports my contention that fawn sex ra- tio is closely linked to a doe's nutritional state at time of estrus, as evidenced by experiments on penned deer (Verme 1965, 1969). In extensive trials on domestic goats, Sachdeva et al. (1973) likewise found that the proportion of male kids increased as the doe's energy intake was reduced (al- though protein level had no similar ef- fect). Robinette et al. (1977) reported that among mule deer in Utah, males com- prised 65.7% of the progeny at a fetal rate of 1.33/mother on poor range (Julander et al. 1961), as compared to 44.1% at 1.85 fecundity on good range. Smith (1981) noted a preponderance of male white- tailed deer fawns in Oregon following years of low rainfall, but an even sex ratio when rainfall the previous year was suf- ficient to promote adequate forage. Man- gold (1958) reported that males com- prised 45.7% of the progeny at gross and maternal fecundity rates of 1.79 and 1.86, respectively, among white-tailed deer in New Jersey. McCullough (1979) observed a decided shift toward production of fe- male progeny following a sharp reduction in deer density (hence improved nutri- tional regime) in Michigan's George Re- serve. Nevertheless, apparent contradic- tions to these findings, which warrant scrutiny, have been reported. Mansell (1974) noted a low percentage J. Wildl. Manage. 47(3):1983</page><page sequence="5">SEX RATIOS IN DEER * Verme 577 of male progeny from deer on purport- edly marginal range in Ontario's Bruce Peninsula and concluded that this vitiated my premise that the reverse should have been true. His appraisal of inadequate range was based on heavy use of winter browse, but stated that deer probably ex- perienced nutritional "flushing" in au- tumn from feeding on green forage and grain crops on pockets of better soils. Mansell's fetal sample included 2 single- tons from doe fawns (pers. commun.), an age-class that achieves puberty only under ideal conditions, as well as a set of triplets from an aged doe. The 7 fetuses from yearling does were slightly high to males, but males comprised only 38.3% of the 47 progeny from older animals producing 1.57 fawns/mother. It was not determined whether these specimens were borne by the area's "productive early breeders ... productive late breeders . . . or the chron- ically late-breeding unproductive" groups of does identified, a potentially important' consideration in sex ratio outcome. High pre- and postnatal mortality due to poor winter range possibly influenced the sub- sequent reproduction of these does. Man- sell thought that the relatively low popu- lation was expanding slowly due to limited harvest rather than good nutrition; how- ever, the variable breeding performance of the does renders this a dubious assess- ment. Woolf and Harder (1979) likewise con- cluded that the fetal sex ratio noted in Pennsylvania's Rachelwood Preserve did not conform to my expectations for un- dernourished deer. Although the sex ratio was "near normal" (9 : 7Y) among fetuses from yearling does, males comprised 39.6% of the 48 specimens from prime- age mothers exhibiting a mere 1.40/ mother fecundity despite supplemental feeding. Minimal recruitment rate evi- denced for this herd could have reflected heavy neonatal losses due to nutritional deprivation during pregnancy; however, Woolf (pers. commun.) doubted that it ex- ceeded 20% from birth to 4 months old. It is noteworthy that during the fetal col- lection period (1969-74), male fawns slightly predominated at Rachelwood, based on known hunting kills, live- trapping, or natural deaths involving a substantial total sample. Such inconsis- tencies can only be reconciled by assum- ing a disproportionately higher postnatal mortality of females, a doubtful phenom- enon. It would appear that Woolf and Harder's study was confounded by an in- adequate feeding program, disruptive biosocial factors, ambiguous sampling methodologies, and small samples which individually or collectively led to equiv- ocal fetal sex ratio data. Robinette et al. (1977) observed that 65.9% of the early-born mule deer fawns in Utah were males, compared to 47.6% among late-born specimens. They rea- soned that because the study area had in- adequate summer range the physical con- dition of does (especially those having reared offspring) probably was subpar at the start of the rut, whereas does breeding later had gained in vigor because the win- ter range was of good quality. One could argue that the surplus of female progeny noted by Mansell (1974) and Woolf and Harder (1979) stemmed from delayed on- set of estrus (hence improved vitality) for some does, as indicated in both studies. Downing (1965) observed a highly un- balanced sex ratio (24 : 6Y) among fawns born in a Georgia enclosure. He speculat- ed that this was related to order of breed- ing by the many adult bucks in the area, wherein their Ist matings resulted in male progeny, and subsequent services yielded more females. However, Robinette et al. (1977) found no evidence from penned- deer studies to substantiate this premise. J. Wildl. Manage. 47(3):1983</page><page sequence="6">578 SEX RATIOS IN DEER * Verme Because deer are polygamous, the domi- nant buck quite likely breeds most of the does. An alternative explanation for Downing's results concerns the fact that nearly half of his doe herd consisted of fawns and yearlings; thus, the distorted sex ratio probably reflected the predomi- nance of such male-conceiver age-classes. Overall fecundity amounted to 1.30 off- spring/mother, a rate typical of younger does. The low population density and good nutrition in this large enclosure would have been conducive to breeding among doe fawns (D. R. McCullough, pers. com- mun.). Nixon (1971) and Haugen (1975) re- ported that males accounted for 57.0 and 55.3%, respectively, of the fetuses carried by adult does in Ohio and Iowa at rates of 1.98 and 2.05/mother. The superb hab- itat in these states promoted excellent growth and thus reproductive perfor- mance among doe fawns. Oddly, the 54.7% male progeny among pregnant doe fawns in the Iowa study was the lowest recorded in literature, being even less than the 57.4% males carried by prime-age mothers. Although Haugen emphasized the possibility of biased sampling in re- gard to fecundity data, it is difficult to see how this could have affected sex ratio findings. Judging from the short (2-3 days) hunting season in both states during the study period, one can surmise that deer populations were comparatively low and/ or of scattered distribution. Verme and Ozoga (1981) showed that does bred near the end of their estrus most frequently conceived males, whereas those insemi- nated early in the cycle produced mainly females. Hence, in low-density herds or where bucks are heavily exploited or har- assed during the rut, a doe in estrus might not be bred until late in estrus in which case she would conceive male progeny. Also, if the buck preferred as sire was not present at estrus onset, a doe probably would wait until the last moment before breeding with a subordinate animal (A. B. Bubenik, pers. commun.). In contrast, be- cause doe fawns normally breed late in the rut, they would not experience de- layed service due to unavailability of mates because, if necessary, they could be bred by buck fawns who achieve puberty at the same time. Ozoga and Verme (1982) noted that males constituted 48.6% of the fawns born in a Michigan enclosure of low carrying capacity. Inadequate nutrition caused one- third of the yearling does to be barren, a fetal rate of only 1.52/mother, and a neo- natal loss of one-third of the annual fawn crop. The sex ratio therefore did not con- form to that "expected" under poor range. Further analysis revealed a likely basis for this apparent incongruity, however, namely that 2.5-year-old does averaged 1.90 fawns/pregnancy as compared to 1.63 for older animals. Because does not rearing offspring subsequently are more productive than those subjected to lacta- tion stress (Verme 1967), it is entirely plausible that the uncommonly prolific group conceived mostly females. This bal- anced out the males produced by stressed but successful mothers, thereby yielding a nearly even progeny sex ratio overall. All reproductive attributes markedly improved after this herd was supplemen- tally fed (Ozoga and Verme 1982). Dur- ing the 5-year study period with a rapidly expanding population, adult does aver- aged 1.72 fawns/mother, and 48.8% of them were males. The greater production of male fawns (62.5%) among primipa- rous yearlings was offset by fewer males (45.6%) from older does. In short, al- though sex ratios were identical between study periods, they originated from com- pletely different nutritional circum- stances; such cause and effect would have J. Wildl. Manage. 47(3):1983</page><page sequence="7">SEX RATIOS IN DEER * Verme 579 been overlooked by a cursory appraisal of the results. In a study on red deer (Cervus elaphus) on the Isle of Rhum (Scotland), Clutton- Brock et al. (1981) found no definite trend in sex ratio of calves with regard to age of hinds, their reproductive status (failure or success) the previous year, or relative quality of home range. Male progeny pre- dominated in all categories examined, being especially prevalent (69%) among births from old (13+ years) mothers. Be- cause this herd existed on mediocre range, the male calf surplus cannot be considered unusual. Fisher (1930) postulated that the sex ra- tio in vertebrates must be 50:50 in the long run because any reproductive advantage gained by 1 sex would eventually shift to the 1 in short supply. McCullough (1979) pointed out, however, that this would not necessarily apply to deer in the short term, because their reproductive strategy differs with ecological conditions. The ability to vary progeny sex ratio would enable a doe to maximize her genetic con- tribution, or "fitness" (an adaptation in her best self-interest), in the face of the con- stantly changing environmental and bio- social situations under which the species evolved (Peterle 1975). Trivers and Willard (1973) proposed that an underfed mother would opt to produce females, because a weak daugh- ter has a greater probability of reproduc- ing than a weak son, thereby protecting the mother's parental investment. How- ever, Myers (1978) challenged this con- cept and the data upon which it was based. Because male offspring normally are larg- er (and presumably more active) than fe- males, in theory they are deemed more expensive to rear to weaning age in terms of lactation requirements. Indeed, Wil- liams (1979) empirically assigned a "cost" of 1.1 for males vs. 1.0 for female off- spring in proposing how mothers might balance the number and sex of progeny as a function of available nutritional in- vestment. This rationale cannot explain the variable sex ratios related to maternal competition in Odocoileus, however; hence, a unified hypothesis is in order. The basic social unit in white-tailed deer, for example, normally consists of a matriarch, several generations of daugh- ters, and their fawns (Ozoga et al. 1982). The matriarch not only invests apprecia- ble energy in nursing offspring but, ex- cept at parturition, continues to invest in them thereafter by sharing her range re- sources, ostensibly a form of genetic kin- selection. Yearling daughters remain with the mother until 3 years old, when they move to an adjacent site to start a family group; however, all members ultimately rejoin and intermingle on their traditional range. Males, on the other hand, ordinari- ly detach themselves from the family at yearling age and emigrate to other areas. Clutton-Brock et al. (1981) concluded that such social bonding did not represent an important form of parental investment in red deer because unrelated hinds as well as daughters (but not sons) occupy over- lapping home ranges; therefore, exclusion of daughters would have little effect on the resources available to a mother. Such distinctions in postweaning interactions should dictate different sex ratio strategies among species. In white-tailed deer, birth of females becomes essential in perpetuating the family group or, in the case of daughters, in forming their own unit, seemingly a compelling drive (Ozoga et al. 1982). Ex- cept under the most favorable circum- stances, it would prove difficult for doe fawns or yearlings to establish a family group. Thus, these mothers would be bet- ter off to produce sons, which have a long- shot chance of breeding if they become J. Wildl. Manage. 47(3):1983</page><page sequence="8">580 SEX RATIOS IN DEER * Verme alpha bucks (McCullough 1979). As de- scribed earlier, pen-bred yearling does commonly conceive a surplus of female progeny. Although improved nutrition in confinement probably was a factor, this response could also reflect relief from ma- ternal domination a year earlier than usu- al; that is, they then mimic an older sister in striving to form a family group. When well fed, a prime-age doe regularly bears daughters, but if range conditions deteri- orate she might conceive a son because of his prospective reproductive advantage should he find better nutrition elsewhere. The urge to perpetuate a family group may not be so strong in aged does; per- haps a final gamble to maximize gene transmission by producing a potential herd sire then becomes of utmost importance, however risky. Ozoga and Verme (1982) reported that at the highest density of 0.63 deer/ha, when behavioral displays indicated mounting social tension due to extreme crowding, even prime-age does began producing more male fawns than former- ly (54.0 vs. 42.1%, respectively), although their fecundity rate declined only slightly. Lack of "elbow room," or visual spacious- ness, apparently constituted a potent psy- chological stressor under this excessive population. After the herd was drastically reduced, prime-age does whose close kin had been intentionally removed exhibited an even progeny sex ratio vs. nearly 60% males among mothers whose families (often crowded together) were left intact (J. J. Ozoga, unpubl. data). Moreover, se- rum progesterone levels in mid-pregnan- cy averaged approximately one-third higher among does without kin, compared to family-intact does. Because the adrenal gland can be an important source of pro- gesterone (Plotka et al. 1983), the higher levels possibly represented some adrenal secretion due to behavioral disorientation induced by absence of family members. This extra progesterone would help main- tain pregnancy to term despite adversity; live births being vital to the re-establish- ment of family groups. These findings suggest that social well-being can exert an influence on progeny sex ratio virtually independent of nutrition. A doe hardly "decides" what sex to con- ceive in an anthropomorphic sense. Rath- er, the sum physiological and optical stim- uli are funneled to responsive endocrine glands whose hormones act on target or- gans to change the odds that an X or Y sperm will fertilize the shed ovum. Vari- ations in vaginal and intracervical pH that occur about the time of ovulation are thought to affect the motility of sperma- tozoa differentially, thus conveying an advantage to 1 type over the other in fer- tilization. More likely, however, a com- plexity of factors modulates the temporal sequence or magnitude of physiological events at estrus (Verme and Ozoga 1981). The relative contributions of nutritional components (energy intake, body protein reserves, and adipose depots) in regulating the mammalian reproductive cycle are poorly understood (Topps 1977, Beal et al. 1978). Stress is known to exacerbate en- docrine dysfunction. Abnormally high progesterone, for example, could modify hormonal secretion and/or feedback in the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis or block estradiol-induced luteinizing hor- mone surges during estrus (Plotka et al. 1983). This could delay time of ovulation within the cycle or the doe's receptivity to the buck to the extent of influencing sex of the conceptus. The interplay of such factors in deer needs to be further ad- dressed through rigorous experiments. CONCLUSIONS Earlier consensus that male births nor- mally predominate in deer (Taber 1953b, J. Wildl. Manage. 47(3):1983</page><page sequence="9">SEX RATIOS IN DEER * Verme 581 Dahlberg and Guettinger 1956, and oth- ers) no doubt stemmed from the fact that prior data pertained mainly to overpop- ulations on impoverished range. General- ly, this situation has been corrected through intensive herd control and habitat improvement practices. Based on this re- view, an excess of male fawns would be expected (1) where the bulk of the breed- ing stock consisted of pubertal doe fawns and yearlings, (2) in herds of low density or scattered distribution, (3) among ani- mals nutritionally deprived during the rut, or (4) in instances of extreme density lead- ing to intraspecific strife. Conversely, more female births would prevail (1) in stable or increasing populations on good range, or alternatively, (2) where seasonal food restrictions caused infertility or heavy neonatal mortality leading to compensa- tory fecundity in the ensuing breeding season. Several of these situations could be operating simultaneously to complicate the issue in the "real world" of deer. The sex ratio relationships outlined here need to be verified or expanded by further inves- tigation. Because of practical constraints, only a few of the many permutations pos- sible in herd dynamics can be elucidated from trials on penned animals. Addition- al, carefully documented studies on free- ranging populations therefore will be required to resolve the effects of such pa- rameters as age structure, absolute den- sity, and range carrying capacity on sex ratio adjustment in deer. Previously I postulated that, coupled with a decline in fecundity, an increase in the proportion of male fawns as range conditions deteriorated would serve as a population self-regulating mechanism. This viewpoint was criticized by R. L. Trivers (pers. commun.), McCullough (1979), and Woolf and Harder (1979) be- cause it implied group-selection attributes as opposed to individual selection. What- ever its nature, a change from an even to an uneven sex ratio toward males, as liv- ing conditions worsen, would in effect re- sult in fewer prospective mothers in fu- ture generations, assuming equal survivability between the sexes. Greater production of females in times of high fe- cundity would accelerate population in- crement appreciably. Biologists ought to be cognizant of such differences among herds and manage them accordingly when establishing bucks-only and/or antlerless deer harvest quotas under a particular set of circumstances.
