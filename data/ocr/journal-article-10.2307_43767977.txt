<plain_text><page sequence="1">PORPHYRIUS ARABUS ON NATURE AND ART: 463F SMITH IN CONTEXT PETER ADAMSON I: Porphyry in Arabic Porphyry, or Furßriüs as he was known in Arabic, was in a sense one of the most important Greek thinkers for the Arabic tradition. If there is anything characteristic of the philosophers who wrote in Arabic up to the time of Avicenna, it is their commitment to the late ancient project of integrating Platonism and Aristotelianism. This eirenic attitude was the most important part of Porphyry's legacy to later Greek thought. The later Greek thinkers who had the greatest influence on Arabic readings of Aristotle did not necessarily pursue Porphyry's reconciliation project in the way Porphyry had. Yet the embrace of that project by Arabic authors means that Arabic philosophy is thoroughly Torphyrian' in a broad sense. The direct impact of Porphyry on the Arabic tradition, however, was slight. Porphyry was known chiefly for having written the Isagoge , a text which in Arabic as in Latin was treated as part of the Aristotelian logical curriculum. Interest in the Isagoge starts already in the Syriac tradition; it was translated into Syriac more than once and Ibn al-Muqaffa' epitomized it. In Arabic it was the subject of numerous commentaries, beginning already with al-Kindī in the 9th century.1 But little was known about who Porphyry was; what biographical information is reported is sometimes fallacious. (Like some authors in the Western tradition, al-Mas'ūdī claims that Porphyry was a Christian, which would no doubt have vexed Porphyry himself.) As for his corpus apart from the Isagoge , the survival of his texts into Arabic has been explored by previous scholars,2 and the extant Arabic fragments are collected in Smith in English translation.3 As so often, the Fihrist of Ibn al-Nadīm is the best guide to what was available in Arabic.4 His report on Porphyry reads as follows: 1 On the fortunes of the Isagoge in Arabic see F. E. Peters, Aristoteles Arābus (Leiden: Brill, 1968) 8-9. 2 See R. Walzer, 'Porphyry and the Arabic tradition,' in Porphyre , Entretiens Fondation Hardt 12 (Vandoeuvres-Geneva 1966) 275-99, and his article in Encyclopedia of Islam, s.v. Furflirīūs. See also F.

He lived after Galen, and explained the books of Aristotle; we have mentioned these in the place where we mentioned Aristotle. And in addition to this, he wrote: (1) the book of the Isagoge , on the introduction to the books of logic; (2) the book of the Introduction to the categorial syllogisms , translated by Abū 'Uthmān al-Dimashqī; (3) the book of The intellect and the intelligible , in an old translation; (4) two books to Anebo; (5) the book of Refutation of Longinus on the intellect and the intelligible ; seven sections in Syriac; (6) the book of the elements; one section in Syriac; (7) the book of the lives of the Philosophers (I have seen the fourth section of it in Syriac); (8) abridgement of Aristotle's philosophy (Flügel 1.253 = Smith 3aT). Material elsewhere in the Fihrist adds that there was in Arabic (9) a commentary on Physics I-IV,5 translated by Basil; (10) a commentary on the Ethics in 12 books, translated by Ishäq ibn Hunayn; and (1 1) a work on sleep and dreams. Moving beyond the Fihrist , there are some fragments of unidentified provenance in Averroes and al-Shahrastānī, dealing with, among other things, matter and the eternity of the world. And there is an otherwise unattested work ascribed to Porphyry, a (1 1) Treatise on the Soul , discovered and published by Paul Kraus6 - this was known to al-TawhTdī, who uses the work in his Muqãbasãt. As I have shown elsewhere, this short work, which probably has nothing to do with the real Porphyry, is influenced by (12) the so-called Theology of Aristotle, an Arabic paraphrase of parts of the Enneads of Plotinus. Although the preface to the Theology claims that the work is a 'commentary' by Porphyry, I have argued that the Theology itself also does not represent a work by Porphyry, but is instead a 9th century Arabic reworking of the Enneads , probably based directly on the original Greek of Plotinus.7 Despite this apparent wealth of Porphyrian and pseudo-Porphyrian material, Porphyry's works apart from the Isagoge are cited only very rarely by authors writing in 'Uthmān al-Dimashql; (3) two books by him [addressed] to Anebo; (4) a book of refutation of Longinus on Intelligence and the Intelligible; (5) a book on the lives of the philosophers, of which I found the fourth section in Syriac; (6) the book of elements, one section existing in Syriac' ( Ta'rīkh 256-57 ed. Lippert = Smith 4T). 5 On which see P. Moraux, 'Porphyre, commentateur de la Physique ď Aristote,' Mélanges offerts à M. de Corte (Bruxelles-Liège 1985) 227-39, and F.

Most famously Miskawayh seems to have drawn on (10) the Ethics commentary in writing his Tadhīb al-akhlãq , and Richard Walzer went so far as to suggest that extensive sections of this work may just reproduce Porphyry's commentary. The Ethics commentary also seems to have been cited by al-'Āmirī. In an appendix to this paper, I will present another text in which Miskawayh claims to be quoting directly from Porphyry, possibly from (9) the Physics commentary. The Fihrist furthermore tells us that Abū Bakr al-Rāzī, an author we will meet again shortly, wrote a refutation of (4) the Letter to Anebo .8 The (7) History of philosophers was cited and used fairly widely, more so than the other philosophical works mentioned by Ibn al-Nadīm. Finally, there are two brief references to Porphyry that will occupy our attention in this paper. In an appendix, I will briefly discuss Avicenna' s criticism (in two separate works) of a doctrine he associates with (3) and (5) Porphyry's work On intellect and the intelligible. But the main focus of this study will be a remark ascribed to Porphyry in an anti- Aristotelian polemical work ascribed to the same al-Rāzī. It will be shown that this is an authentic Arabic fragment of (9) Porphyry's commentary on the Physics - indeed, it is the only such fragment whose authenticity can be verified. In what follows I will be concentrating on the fragment from Porphyry's commentary on the Physics. First, I will identify the Greek philosophical background of the fragment (or more accurately, testimony: it is a report of his views and not necessarily a direct quot- ation). Second, I will argue that the likely historical context of the fragment tells us something about the Arabic reception of Porphyry's non-logical works, namely that the Porphyrian legacy was most significant among the Peripatetic school of 10th century Baghdad. II: The Greek context: (pvenç and rexw] One of the most striking, and to modern readers, notorious aspects of Book II of Aristotle's Physics is the analogy Aristotle makes between nature, (/mai?, and art, Té'vx'. The point of the analogy is that nature, like art, is teleological: it acts towards an end or Tor the sake of something (evcKá tou)'. But the analogy is, of course, imperfect. The most striking disanalogy between nature and art is that, whereas an artefact is the outcome of the deliberation, rationality, and choice of the artisan or craftsman, nature does not seem to exhibit any of these features. Alexander of Aphrodisias claimed that there was a further disanalogy: artisans, unlike nature, look to a model (rrapabeiypa) when they produce artifacts. Admitting that nature looks to a model would result in admitting something like Platonic Forms, and admitting that natural effects require deliberation and choice would make nature dependent on some prior, providential mind. The upshot is that Aristotelians must steer a middle course with regard to the analogy between nature and art. If nature is not enough like art, then it will not be teleological; but if it is too much like art, then nature will be anthropomorphized, with unwelcome metaphysical results. 8 David Reisman informs me that there is a fragment of this work to be found in the writings of the 10lh century Neoplatonist al-Isfizārī, who possibly knew it through al-Rāzī.</page><page sequence="4">1 44 STUDIES ON PORPHYRY As Charles Genequand has shown,9 this middle course is the one that Alexander tries to navigate in his commentaries on the Metaphysics and Physics . The worry about paradigms comes out in Alexander's comments on Metaphysics A.9 (in Met. 103.4- 104.18), which reads in part (103.22-26): But certainly neither a man nor a horse nor any other of the things that generate and produce naturally produces the thing it generates while looking to a model (Trpos* ti uapdÔÉiypa ßXcTrov); for it is not by giving any thought whatever to how the thing that is to be should come to be that they set about producing what they produce, as we see in the case of the arts.10 Notice that the argument against paradigms here depends on the other point Alexander needs to make, namely that nature does not think or deliberate. He emphasizes that whereas art is a 'rational' power, nature is 'non-rational (aXoyoç)'. This also emerges from Alexander's comments on Book II of the Physics , which have been partially preserved by Simplicius.11 Here Alexander writes: On the one hand, in the case of things that produce according to choice, art and reason, the end must be that for the sake of which everything else comes to be; it must first be conceived in the mind of the producer and be set up as a target (okottosO and model (TTapaôeiypa) for what is to be; on the other hand, in the case of things that come to be by nature this is not so. For nature does not work by choice or by any reason within it; nature is a non-rational power (aXoyos* bwapi?).12 In a well-known passage, he underlines this by comparing the functioning of nature to that of puppets, where a chain of motions is transmitted from one thing to another automatically, 'not according to reason or through any choice in themselves'.13 It is again Genequand who draws our attention to the contrast between Alexander's views and those of Galen, who, in On the use of parts, goes so far as to say that nature is an 'artistic power'. He also favourably compares the t6xvt| of nature with that of humans. In short, Galen tends towards a more anthropomorphic understanding of nature than his rival Alexander.14 But for our purposes a more useful foil for Alexander's views can be 9 C. Genequand, 'Quelques aspects de l'idée de nature, ď Aristote à al-Ghazālī,' Revue de théologie et de philosophie 116 (1984) 105-29. I have been greatly helped by Genequand's study, which like what follows, discusses al-Rāzī and the Baghdad Peripatetics as well as the evidence from Greek sources. 10 Translation from Alexander of Aphrodisias, On Aristotle's Metaphysics 7, trans.

In his own commentary on the Physics , Simplicius finds himself in the classic Neoplatonic commentatorial dilemma of wanting to reconcile his own Platonic views with an un- Platonic Aristotelian text. In particular, he wants to present nature as dependent on higher metaphysical entities. After citing Alexander's views on nature, Simplicius insists that Aristotle is not rejecting the Platonic understanding of natural forms as images of paradigms. When Aristotle speaks of form in this context, he only means immanent or enmattered forms, but still, fit is possible to use Aristotle's hypotheses to show that the causes of forms in this world are distinct from them and are models (mxpaSeiypaTa) for them' (296.32-34). The rationality of nature reflects the higher intelligible forms (314.12- 14). Simplicius turns the image of the puppets against Alexander, pointing out (314.6-7, cf. 313.21-24) that even if the puppets are themselves without knowledge, their orderly motions prove that they were designed by a rational agent external to them. Alexander's view may also be contrasted to that of John Philoponus. In his Physics commentary15 Philoponus is clear that Aristotle is rejecting any Platonic talk of external 'paradigms' for nature (241.20-21); so here he is in agreement with Alexander. However, at least one passage suggests that he still wants to see immanent natures as dependent on an external, providential principle.16 Here he distinguishes between 'nature itself,' which is a providential, active principle, and the activity of nature as it is exercised in particular bodies: It is worth noting that [Aristotle's] definition [of nature] does not signify what nature is but the activity of nature ... So in order to give also the definition of [its] essence itself we must say this, that nature is a life or a power which has descended into bodies, and which moulds and manages them (f) &lt;1)6(719 icori fļTOi Suvapiç KcrraÔÉÔUKUÍa 8ià tcov acopcmov, öiauXacrnKfi airrcov Kai 8lolkt1tlkt))... And that nature manages not only animate things but also inanimate ones is clear. . . But it is clear that as form is more manifest in the animate so also is the providence (TTpovoia) of nature (197.30-198.6). As we will see, Arabic commentators thought that for Philoponus nature descended from separate, immaterial causes, even though he rejected the idea that nature looks to paradigms. According to this interpretation Philoponus' view would represent something of a middle ground between Alexander's staunch anti-Platonism and Simplicius' explicit embrace of external paradigms.17 associated with art and reason. All of these - soul, reason, and art - are said to be prior to body and its properties. 15 For an English translation of his commentary on Book II see A. R. Lacey (trans.), Philoponus, On Aristotle Physics 2 (London 1993). I will quote from this translation in what follows. 16 See further E. M. Macierowski and R. F. Hassing, 'John Philoponus on Aristotle's definition of nature,' Ancient Philosophy 8 (1988) 73-100 (86-87). 17 Whether this is an accurate interpretation is a question I cannot go into here; the fact that Alexander, too, says that nature 'descends' (albeit from the heavens) suggests that Philoponus is not departing from Aristotelian orthodoxy here. See Alexander, in Meteor. 7.10-14 and Mantissa 23 (my thanks to Bob Sharpies for these references).</page><page sequence="6">1 46 STUDIES ON PORPHYRY This contrast between Alexander and the later Neoplatonic commentators shows that the question of how far to take the analogy between art and nature could have far-reaching metaphysical consequences. It provides us with the necessary context to understand what might have been behind the aforementioned fragment of Porphyry's Physics commentary. Ill: 46 3 F Smith: a fragment from Porphyry's Commentary on the Physics The fragment is found in an anti- Aristotelian polemical work ascribed to the iconoclastic philosopher and physician Abū Bakr ibn Zakariyyâ' al-RāzT. The authenticity of this work has been doubted, but that issue need not detain us here. All that matters for our purposes is that, as will become clear below, our author was well-acquainted with the 10th century Arabic discussions of Aristotle's Physics and its Greek commentators. I will, for convenience, refer to this author as al-Rāzī, leaving it however open as to whether the attribution is correct. The work in question is entitled Maqãla fi mā bďd al-tabVa ( Treatise on Metaphysics ), but despite its title it is a frontal assault on Aristotelian and Galenic conceptions of nature.18 The extant text, which is incomplete, falls into three sections: a general criticism of the Aristotelian doctrine of nature (116.2-124.6), a section attacking philosophical theories about human fetuses (124.7-128.2), and a cosmologica! section, which discusses the eternity of the world, the possibility of multiple worlds, and the question of whether the world is infinitely large (128.3-134.11). Our fragment appears in the first section (120.19-121.19): [A] As for Alexander's claim that the acts of nature are superior (fawqa ) to the acts that take place through the arts (sinā'āt), one may say to him, 'but how can marvellous and exalted acts be a task for the lifeless and the powerless, while the acts inferior to these belong to the living, the powerful, and the willing?' [B] Porphyry contradicts himself in his statement that nature acts without intellect ('aql ), thought (fikr ), or will ( irāda ), yet does nothing through chance ( ittifaq '), given that it does one thing for the sake of another. [This is a contradiction] because this does not occur except due to (min) something that has understanding (' ãqil ), discrimination (mumayyiz) and will. [C] I have not seen any of them apply the expression 'choice (ikhtiyãrf to it, except for what John Philoponus reports from Plotinus. If the latter [sc. Plotinus] ascribes choice to what is lifeless, then he has achieved the height of contradiction. [D] Porphyry and others have argued, regarding the second book of the Physics (sam ' al-kiyän ), that nature does what it does only for an end, and for the sake of something. Thus he says that nature is more exalted and has greater power than craft ( mihna ), just as man is a living thing that, being natural, has a more exalted power than the man in a picture. He says too that if this is the case, and the 18 For an Arabic edition see al-Rāzī, Rasā' il falsafiyya, ed. P. Kraus (Cairo 1939), at 1 16-34. Italian translation and commentary in G. A. Lucchetta, Im natura e la sfera: la scienza antica e le sue metafore nella critica di Rāzī (Bari 1987). The fragment is discussed in Genequand (n.9 above) 123f., who is very critical of a previous discussion by H. V. B. Brown, 'Avicenna and the Christian philosophers in Baghdad,' Islamic Philosophy and the classical tradition , ed. S. M. Stem, A. Houráni and V. Brown (Oxford 1972) 35-47.</page><page sequence="7">PETER ADAMSON: PORPHYRIUS ARABUS ON NATURE &amp; ART 1 47 possessor of craft does what it does for the sake of something, then in just the same way nature only does what it does for the sake of something, and does nothing at random ( hi - ' l-khabt ) or by chance. [E] Thus one may say to him, 'it is not the case that the craftsman, as a living, powerful, willing, and thinking being, acts precisely in view of the benefit to be had from the thing that is his aim and the reason for which he acts?' He must say yes. Then one may say, 'and is nature just the same?' If he says yes, he contradicts his own statement, but if he says no, then the case he wants to illustrate conflicts with the example. One may also say to him, 'on what basis do you deny that the craft does what it does due to some end, and for the sake of something, but that nature is not like this?' [F] One may say to them, 'the craft, according to us, does not do anything, but the one who has the craft is the one who acts, because the agent is the carpenter or the builder, not the art of building or carpentry. The carpenter and the builder are alive, and both of them are superior to lifeless nature. Since the living man is the agent, and according to you he is natural, then it is as if you have compared something to itself.' This passage comes in the midst of a sustained polemic against what al-Rāzī takes to be a contradiction in the Aristotelian account of nature. On the one hand, the Aristotelians want nature to be teleological. As he puts it, for them 'nature does nothing without wisdom and right reason, and it aims at an end, making one thing so that another may exist' (1 18.7-8). Yet they also want to deny that nature is literally a rational agent: rather it is 'lifeless, unsensing, powerless, bereft of choice and of knowledge' (1 18.12-13). What we have here, then, is a text focused on the dilemma confronted by Alexander: how far can we push the analogy between nature and a rational agent such as an artisan? In section [A] of our text, Alexander is quoted as claiming that art is inferior to nature. Though this seems to emphasize the disparity of art and nature, actually it could be part of an argument for their shared teleological character. The argument would be as follows: art acts for a purpose, and nature is superior to art. But if art acted for a purpose and nature did not, nature would be inferior to art. Therefore nature, like art, acts for a purpose. This fleshed out version of the argument is what al-Rāzī ascribes to Porphyry in section [D]. Now, one might wonder whether it is an argument that could have been embraced by either Alexander or Porphyry. For, if section [B] is to be believed, Porphyry followed Alexander in emphasizing the non-rationality of nature in contrast to art.19 But this could be refuted by a parallel version of the same argument: nature is superior to art, but art is rational, and what is non-rational is inferior to what is rational; therefore nature is, like art, rational. This is the point made by al-Rāzī in section [E]. We know, however, that Porphyry at least did accept the argument, because al-Rāzī' s section [D] reproduces Porphyry's comment on a passage of Physics II.8, which is pre- 19 It's important to notice that Porphyry is here agreeing with what Alexander has to say on this topic in section [A]. This is obscured by the translation in Smith, which at the beginning of [B] reads 'he [sc. Alexander] disagreed with Porphyry ...' where it should read 'Porphyry contradicts himself. The Arabic reads: ' wa nãqada Furfūrīūsfi qawlihi ...'.</page><page sequence="8">1 48 STUDIES ON PORPHYRY served in Greek by Simplicius.20 The passage is 199al5f, where Aristotle says that 'art either completes what nature cannot bring to perfection, or else it imitates.' Simplicius says: If art works together with nature or imitates it, and if the products of art are for some purpose, it is clear that the products of nature are too. For the end stands in the same relationship to the means in the field of art as in the field of nature, since art imitates nature and shares common ground with it. So if in the field of art the cause is for the sake of the effect, it is similarly so in the field of nature. Yet Porphyry says that in this case the reasoning is a fortiori : 'For if art, which is inferior to nature as image is inferior to model, effects the means for the sake of the end, all the more will nature, in that it is superior to art, act in the same way.' But in what sense could he claim that art is inferior to nature, since Aristotle says that art completes what nature cannot bring to perfection? Unless, of course, he meant it in the sense that art makes good the deficiencies (even what is inferior can achieve that) or else produces imitations.21 This is obviously the passage behind section [D] of the text cited above, which, to my knowledge, makes [D] the first known authentic fragment of Porphyry's commentary on the Physics in Arabic.22 In light of this, it would seem that al-Rāzī was rather well- 20 Thus Genequand (n.9 above), in his otherwise excellent article, is wrong to say of al-Rāzī' s quot- ations of Greek authors: 'toutes ces références semblent fausses . . . aucune des citations de Porphyre que l'on trouve ne correspond à ce que dit al-Rāzī' (124 n.81). Strangely, neither Romano nor Smith include this passage in their collections of Porphyrian fragments culled from Simplicius' in Phys. On the other hand, Luchetta (n.18 above) goes too far in saying (p. 98): 'Agli occhi di Rāzī forse Porfirio appare come l'esegeta capace più di ogni altro di offrire una trattazione complete ed esaustive di tutti i più diversi atteggiamenti intellettuali dello Stagirita.' In fact the fragment studied here is the only text where al-Rāzī shows knowledge of Porphyry (though as we saw he is credited with a response to the Letter to Anebo), and he does not seem to be privileged over Philoponus or Alexander. 21 ci ouv auvc pyò?

It is worth noting that Philoponus' commentary does not contain this statement from Porphyry; since Simplicius' commentary was not available in Arabic and Porphyry's was, it seems that al-Rāzī' s knowledge stems from a quotation of the Arabic version of Porphyry's commentary, or (less likely) from the commentary itself. 22 There is a related fragment to be found in al-Sharastānī, namely Smith 462F. This may also be related to Porphyry's Physics commentary, and reads in part (translation from Smith's edition of the fragments): 'nature acts without thought or intelligence or will, but it does not act simply at random</page><page sequence="9">PETER ADAMSON: PORPHYRIUS ARABUS ON NATURE &amp; ART 149 informed about not only Aristotle's Physics but also some of the Greek commentaries on the Physics', and it would seem that these commentators included Porphyry.23 IV: The Arabic context: the Baghdad Peripatetics How did al-Rāzī get his information? Well, as we saw above, Ibn al-Nadīm, himself a resident of 10th century Baghdad (he died in either 385/995 or 388/998), knew of an Arabic version of Porphyry's commentary on Physics I-IV, which would of course have included our text on II.8. And the Physics itself was well known to Arabic authors at the time. This is shown above all by the so-called Baghdad Physics, 24 which is preserved in a unique manuscript held in Leiden. The manuscript contains a translation of the Physics by Ishâq ibn Hunayn, along with comments by several Christian members of the Baghdad school of Peripatetic philosophers. The most famous representative of the Peripatetic movement in Baghdad is the Muslim al-Fārābī, but for our purposes the crucial figures are the Christian thinkers gathered around Yahyâ ibn 'Adi, one of al-Fārābī' s students. Ibn 'Adī was also a student of the Christian Abū Bishr Mattā ibn Yunus, and he devoted intensive philosophical activity to Christian theological writing as well as to more straightforward Aristotelian philosophical work.25 Ibn 'Adī and his school have been aptly compared in their aims and methods to the Alexandrian school of later Neoplatonists. Indeed their activity may be said to be part of a more or less continuous tradition of reading and commenting on Aristotle that stretches forward from the school of Ammonius. I want to argue now that al-Rāzī's discussion may well have been a response to the activities of the Baghdad school. The Baghdad Physics is an edition of the Physics made by a third generation student of Yahyâ ibn 'Adī named Abu '1-Husayn al-Basrī. Al-Basrī's version collates comments by Ibn 'Adī himself with notes from the lecture course of 'Abū 'Alī ibn al-Samh, a student of Ibn 'Adī's.26 Of particular interest to us, of course, are the Baghdad philosophers' and haphazardly; rather it does only what has order and arrangement and wisdom, and sometimes it does one thing for the sake of another'. 23 Cristina D'Ancona has reminded me that our report might be based, not on an Arabic version of Porphyry's entire commentary, but rather on a collection of such reports. Certainly one cannot suppose with any confidence that al-Rāzī himself knew any more of the commentary he cites. But still, given the evidence of the Fihrist, it seems likely that he might have known a copy of the Physics that had collated passages drawn directly from the Arabic version of Porphyry's commentary. 24 Ed.

These include remarks by Abū Bishr Mattā, Ibn 'Adì and Ibn al- Samh. Arabic versions of comments by John Philoponus and, more occasionally, Alexander, are also included. So we are in a position to see that these philosophers were aware of Alexander's views on nature, and the senses in which it is analogous and disanalogous to art.27 One of the Alexander comments in the Baghdad Physics reads as follows: Nature is not an efficient cause of what comes to be by chance, but rather deliberation and will are. For chance comes about through acts of will resulting from deliberation. Will is acquired and not natural, even if it is by his nature that man wills the goal of will,28 while art is external to the things; but as for the goal of nature and form, it is the same thing. Will may not come to be with[out] complete deliberation, while chance is what comes to be willingly out of deliberation.29 I have not found that Alexander's specific worry about paradigms was also communicated to the Arabic tradition, but the Baghdad school did recognize the importance of the question of whether nature exercises or displays the hallmarks of choice or deliberation. This is clear from their comments on Physics II. In general our Arabic commentators are at pains to follow Aristotle closely, and the Greek commentaries they are aware of. These seem to have been principally Alexander and Philoponus. Here the Arabic commentators had a choice between two ways of viewing nature. On the one hand, as we have seen, Alexander was not only happy to allow nature to serve as an explanatory principle without invoking a further, external or 'supernatural' cause, but went so far as to restrict the analogy to rêxvr' so as to prevent such an inference. The Arabic commentators were aware of Alexander's view, but their own position is closer to that of Simplicius or Philoponus, who is quoted extensively in the Baghdad Physics. Thus regarding Physics II.8, Abū Bishr writes: By 'active nature ( al-tabVa al-fa"ālay I mean neither the matter nor the form, but rather the nature that is disseminated ( mabthūth ) into all generated things that makes them come-to-be. For the body that is generated and corrupted through the contact of the heavens is affected by [the heavens] through this nature, and this [heavenly] body [is moved] by another body, and the other body through the motion of the Creator... (151.3-15). And the Baghdad Physics ascribes the following statement to Yahyâ, meaning either Ibn 'Adi or Philoponus: 27 For the fragments of Alexander in the Baghdad Physics see E.

He [sc. Aristotle] thus infers from this the Creator - great and sanctified is His name - while Plato says that the Creator - the exalted - fashions an intellectual art (sinā'a ' aqliyya ) in things so that they may do their actions towards ends. (148.2-4) I believe that al-Rāzī was aware of the Baghdad school's interpretation of Physics II, and that he may even have had them primarily in mind as the immediate targets of his Treatise on Metaphysics. A good indication of this is a passage where al-Rāzī criticizes the statement that 'nature is inspired with wisdom thanks to the soul and is disseminated into the world', where the term 'disseminated' ( mabthūth ) reproduces Abū Bishr's terminology. (This also explains some of the thrust of the polemic of the Treatise : why, al-Rāzī argues, introduce this complicated idea of a providential nature whose power is delegated to it by prior causes? Much simpler simply to ascribe all this provident activity directly to God.) In light of this, I think it likely that al-Rāzī got whatever knowledge he had of Porphyry's commentary on the Physics through the intermediary of his Peripatetic opponents - and the same goes, of course, for what he knows of Alexander and Philoponus.30 Unfortunately the Baghdad Physics that has come down to us does not contain our fragment of Porphyry. But this certainly does not mean that the Baghdad school couldn't have been al-Rāzī's immediate source. We know that the Baghdad school had independent access to the Physics paraphrase of Themistius,31 for instance, but only a few passages from this work are included in the Baghdad Physics. 30 Another indication that al-Rāzī was reacting to the Baghdad school comes in the opening sentence, where he restates Aristotle's claim that there is no need to prove that nature exists, because it is obvious. Here the wording is similar to that of Ibn al-Samh, 82. 12-13, though it is not similar to the wording of Ishâq's translation. Indeed I wonder whether al-Rāzī might not have been working with an earlier translation of the Physics , the lost version of al-Himsī, one of al-Kindī's translators and the translator of the Theology of Aristotle. For instance in a description of the argument of Antiphon in Physics II. 1, he uses the older word 'unsur (122.18), which does not appear in this context in the Baghdad Physics. I am especially inclined towards this hypothesis because al-Rāzī actually mentions a translator from Greek named al-Himsï later in the text (124. 10), ascribing to him certain views on human embryology. 31 We know this from al-Qifti, who owned a copy of the paraphrase that had been studied under Yahyâ ibn 'Adī: see Endress, The Works ofYahyã ibn 'Adi (n.25 above) 2.</page><page sequence="12">1 52 STUDIES ON PORPHYRY V: The philosophical significance of the fragment All of this raises the question of the extent to which Porphyry anticipated the under- standing of nature that we find in the Baghdad Peripatetics. Turning back to the Arabic fragment, we find him saying that 'nature is more exalted and has greater power than craft, just as man is a living thing that, being natural, has a more exalted power than the man in a picture'. The Greek version is more succinct: 'art is inferior to nature as image is inferior to model'. Whichever is closer to Porphyry's original wording, what is clear is that he used the relation of image and model to describe the way that art imitates nature. Here he is following Alexander (see in Met. 103.22-26, quoted above). If al-Rāzī's Alexander fragment is also genuine, then Porphyry was also following Alexander (and Galen) when he claimed that the acts of nature are superior to those of art. Nothing in the fragment, then, goes against the view of Alexander, which is itself a telling detail about Porphyry's commentatorial style and influences. However, given Porphyry's Platonist commitments, it is tempting to wonder whether he took the further step of saying that natural objects, which are the models of artefacts, are in turn only an image of a higher model. Whether or not he did so in the full context of this passage, he certainly did so elsewhere in the Physics commentary. For, towards the beginning of his own commentary, Simplicius relates Porphyry's remarks on Aristotle's division of the ways of understanding the term 'principle (àpxfi)'. In addition to the starting point of a motion, the final end, and the 'by which (ixf&gt; ' ou), as the nature of natural things and the art of artefacts,' there is also the formal cause: But whereas Aristotle, having in view the form in the matter, spoke only of this as a principle, Plato, thinking about the separate form in addition to this, posited the paradigmatic principle (Tfļv TTapaÔ6iyp.aTLKf)y dpxfjv). According to Aristotle, then, principle is fourfold: for there is the 'out of which' understood as matter, the 'according to which' understood as form, the 'by which' understood as the agent, and the 'on account of which' (8i' o) understood as the end. But according to Plato there is also the 'in relation to which' (TTpòç ö), understood as the paradigm, and the 'through which' (Si' ou) understood as the instrument. And as many ways as principle is said, in so many ways is cause said (Porphyry ap. Simplicium in Phys. 10.32-11.5 [=Smith 120F 1 1-20]).32 As George Karamanolis has said apropos of this passage in a recent article, 'Porphyry's formulation here suggests that for him the transcendent Form is the model after which a material entity was made, in the same way that the idea of the bed is the model for a carpenter who sets out to create a bed'.33 32 Simplicius also mentions the six-cause interpretation of Plato, at in Phys . 26.5ff. 33 G. Karamanolis, 'Porphyry: the first Platonist Commentator on Aristotle,' in Philosophy , science and exegesis in Greek, Arabic and Latin commentaries , ed. P. Adamson, H. Baltussen, and M. W. F. Stone, 2 vols (London 2004) 1.91-113 (106). Another text also discussed by Karamanolis, Seneca's Epistle 65, also uses the term 'paradigm (exemplar)' to describe Plato's Forms as a fifth type of cause above and beyond the four Aristotelian causes. It is worth noting that Seneca also emphasizes the connection between paradigms and the work of a craftsman. Arguing for the Stoic</page><page sequence="13">PETER AD AMSON: PORPHYRIUS ARAB US ON NATURE &amp; ART 1 53 All of this talk of craftsmen and paradigms is bound, of course, to put us in mind of the Timaeus , especially 28-29, which says that the world is fashioned by the Demiurge as a copy of an eternal pattern. So it is worth turning at least briefly to what Porphyry had to say about the activity of the Demiurge in his commentary on the Timaeus. Unfortunately this work, like the Physics commentary, is lost, but Proclus has preserved some useful information for us. In an overview of Platonic interpretations of Timaeus 28-29, he reports that Porphyry, claiming to follow the lead of Plotinus, associated the Demiurge with the 'hypercosmic' Soul and the pattern followed by the Demiurge with its Intellect ('so that the model followed by the Demiurge is the intellect', cas* el vai tò Trapáôeiyiia tov ÔT1p.toupyoû... tòv vovv' Proclus In Tim . 1.306.32-307.4, ed. Diels). Proclus repeats this elsewhere in the commentary, including the equivalence of voûç and Trapáôeiyjia on Porphyry's view (1.322.1-7, cf. 1.431.20-23). Proclus complains that Porphyry's inter- pretation is baseless as a reading of Plato, who never says that Demiurge is soul, hyper- cosmic or otherwise, and that it does not seem to be an accurate portrayal of Plotinus' view either. Be that as it may, the report is helpful for us because it suggests how Porphyry could have filled out the analogy between natural objects and artefacts that we find in the fragment from his Physics commentary: AGENT: Human craftsman Demiurge MODEL: Natural object Intelligible Form COPY: Artefact Natural object Just as, for example, a painter looks to a natural object such as a man and then paints his picture, so the Demiurge looks to the Forms in his production of the cosmos. The point of the fragment from his Physics commentary was that natural objects, like artefacts, must be Tor the sake of something' - that is, nature is teleological. So far, so Aristotelian. The Stoics, too, would have agreed, and unlike Aristotle they would have added that nature's teleology shows that it is guided by intelligence. But this additional material from Porphyry's commentaries on the Physics and Timaeus suggests that Porphyry was at least implicitly saying something quite different from Aristotle, the Stoics, or Alexander when he said that nature is a TrapdSeiyjia for art. Whereas Alexander explicitly cautioned the reader against inferring that nature has an external model, Porphyry actually believed that the products of art relate to natural objects in much the way natural objects relate to the Forms.34 For him this would have been an advantage, rather than a misleading aspect, of the analogy. point of view, he dismisses the Aristotelian and Platonic identification of forms and paradigms as independent types of cause. It is only the artisan who is truly a cause. Insofar as he imposes a form, form may grudgingly be admitted to be 'part of the cause'. But the best that can be said for the pattern or paradigm the artisan has in mind is that it is an indispensable 'instrument' for the artisan. ( Formam dicis causam esse? Hanc imponit artifex operi; pars causae est, non causa. Exemplar quoque non est causa, sed instrumentum causae necessarium : Ep. 65, §13.) 34 It should perhaps be noted that Alexander also compares divine action to the activity of a craftsman, at De intellectu 112. However he does not, of course, suggest that this divine craftsman has recourse to paradigms in his activity.</page><page sequence="14">1 54 STUDIES ON PORPHYRY The analogy is nevertheless not perfect, insofar as our Arabic fragment shows that Porphyry, like Alexander, still wanted to deny that nature exercizes thought or choice. Yet teleology does depend on the exercise of thought and choice at some level, namely the level of the Demiurge. In affirming the need for such an intelligent and providential cause beyond the level of immanent forms, Porphyry was the forerunner of Simplicius and the Baghdad Peripatetics, who believed that teleology was the result of some such cause. The Baghdad Peripatetics are explicit in tracing the teleology of nature ultimately to the providence of God Himself. Like them, Porphyry has his cake and eats it too, showing how Aristotle's conception of nature can be understood using Alexander's own interpretation, and yet also seeing the relation of art to nature as mirroring a higher Platonic metaphysical relationship of sensible copy to intelligible model. That this would have been Porphyry's considered position seems clear. Less certain is whether he made this explicit in his commentary on Physics II. If he did, then Porphyry was in fact the first to use a commentary on Physics II as an opportunity for integrating Platonic metaphysics with Aristotelian natural science - a project thoroughly Porphyrian in spirit, and one that was taken up by the later Greek commentators and their Arabic inheritors.35 King 's College London 35 1 am very grateful for helpful comments by participants at the conference on Porphyry held at the Institute of Classical Studies, especially Bob Sharpies, Riccardo Chiaradonna, George Karamanolis, Andrew Smith, and Steven Strange.

In fact it lists the title twice: The book of The intellect and the intelligible , in an old translation... the book of Refutation ofLonginus on the intellect and the intelligible ; seven sections in Syriac.' It seems safe to assume that this in fact refers to two versions of the same work. The first was an 'old translation,' i.e. a translation made early in the Arabic tradition, prior to the sophisticated productions of the school of Hunayn ibn Ishâq. The entry tells us, then, that this work was available in both Arabic and Syriac. What was its content? Though it is lost, we know the answer from Porphyry himself: in his Life of Plotinus , Porphyry explains (ch. 18) how he was converted by his fellow student Amelius to the Plotinian position that the intelligibles are identical to intellect itself. He had previously held, in agreement with Longinus, that the intelligibles were 'outside' the intellect. Porphyry goes on to quote the preface from a work by Longinus, in which Longinus makes the following remark: '[Porphyry], who has himself written a good deal in the manner of Plotinus, whose direction he has preferred to my own, tried to demonstrate in a treatise that the doctrine of Plotinus about the Ideas was better than that which I approve (ènex^ipriae 8ià airyypáppaTos' àïïoSeîÇai ßeXTico 8ó£av TT£pl Tc ùv ISecòv Tfjç pplv àp£&lt;JKOuar|9 £^ovTa). I think I showed fairly thoroughly in my reply that his change of mind was a mistake (oik ev uaXivcp8f)aavTa) ,..'36 The Refutation of Longinus was then a work defending Plotinus' doctrine that the intelligibles are not outside the intellect - also defended by Plotinus himself, of course, in Ennead V.5.37 It is especially the Fihrisť s mention of Longinus by name that invites us to identify the work translated into Arabic with the work mentioned in the Life of Plotinus. Now, there is another author writing in Arabic who refers to a work by Porphyry called On intellect and the intelligibles. The author is none other than Avicenna. In al- Ishārāt wa ' l-tanbihāt ( Pointers and reminders ), he writes the following: They had a man known as Porphyry, who wrote a book On intellect and the intelligibles , and who was praised by the Peripatetics ( mashshā'ūn ), but it is utter drivel, and they [sc. the Peripatetics] know themselves that they don't understand it, as neither did Porphyry himself. He was contradicted by one of the people of his time, and his argument back against this detractor was more worthless still than his original claims. Pointer. Know that the statement of someone who says that one thing becomes another thing - but not in the sense that it changes from one state to another, nor in the sense that it is composed together with the other thing, so that a further thing comes to be from these two, nor in the sense that it is one thing first, and comes to be another thing - is a poetic, unintelligible statement. For [suppose that two things become identical:] if (1) each of the two things still exists, then the two are 36 Life of Plotinus ch. 20, Armstrong trans. 37 See further A. H. Armstrong, 'The background of the doctrine "that the intelligibles are not outside the intellect'", in A. H. Armstrong, Plotinian and Christian Studies (London 1979), art.

If (2) one of them is non-existent, something has been destroyed: if this non-existent thing is what existed before, then it brought something else into existence (or if it did not, then we must hypothesize yet another thing to bring about that something else). But if (3) they are both non- existent, then neither of the two becomes the other. Rather, it is only possible to say that [for example] water becomes air, insofar as the subject of being-water (&lt; al - mä'iyyä) casts off being- water, and puts on being-air Ç al-hawä'iyya)™ A more elaborate bit of invective on the same topic can be found in Avicenna's major work, alShifā ' ( The healing): The statement that the essence of the soul becomes the intelligibles is, in my view, wholly absurd. I cannot understand their statement that one thing becomes another thing, and I do not know how this can be. For if it is by casting off one form and putting on another, so that it is one thing together with the first form, and another thing together with the other form, then the first thing has not really become the second thing, but rather the first thing has been destroyed, and there remains only its subject ( mawdû ') or a part of it. But if it is not like that, let us consider how it does occur. We say then: if one thing (A) becomes another thing (B), then, since it (A) has become this other thing (B), either it (A) is existent or it is non-existent. If it (A) is existent, then the second, other thing (B) is also either existent or non- existent. If it (B) is existent then the two (A and B) are two existents, not one and the same existent. But if it (B) is non-existent, then this existent (A) has become something non-existent, not a different existent, and this is unintelligible. But if the first (A) has ceased to exist, then it has not become another thing (B) but rather has ceased to exist, and another thing (B) has come about.39 How, then, does the soul become the forms of things? What has confused people most of all is what the author of the Isagoge wrote for them. He meant to speak in statements that were imagistic, poetic and mystical,40 thereby limiting himself and others to imagination ( takhayyul ). His books On intellect and the intelligible and On the soul indicate this to people of discrimination. To be sure, the forms of things do occur in the soul, adorning and ornamenting it, and the soul is like a place ( makān ) for them, through the intermediary of the material intellect. But if the soul were actually to become the form of one of the existents, the form being the actuality and essentially an actuality ([for] there is no potentiality in the essence of the form to receive anything, the potentiality for receiving belonging only to what receives something), it would follow that the soul would then have no potentiality to receive any other form or anything else. But in fact [the soul] does receive another form different from that form. If in addition this different form is not distinct from the first form, that would be strange indeed, for [soul's] receiving and not receiving would be the 38 S. Dunya, (ed.), Ibn Sīnā.

But if they are different, then without doubt - if it is the intelligible form - [the soul] has become different from itself. Or, none of this is the case, but instead the soul is intellecting: and by 'intellect' one means the potential by which it intellects, or one means the forms of these intelligibles in themselves. And because they are in the soul they are intelligible. But the intellect, the intellecting and the intelligible are not one and the same thing in our souls. (Though to be sure, in something else, this is possible, as we will discuss in its proper place). And likewise for the material intellect, if by this one means absolute aptitude [for intellection] on the part of the soul, then this will be in us for as long as we remain in the body. But if by ['material intellect'] one means [an aptitude] for a relation to some given thing, then the aptitude is destroyed with the presence of actuality.41 These passages raise numerous historical and philosophical questions, some of which cannot be explored fully here. For our purposes the most important issues are these: first, what was the doctrine of Porphyry's On intellect and the intelligibles ,42 as far as Avicenna understood it? Second, who are the admirers of Porphyry (the 'Peripatetics') castigated by Avicenna in both passages? In answer to the first question, clearly Porphyry argued for the identity of intellect with the intelligibles. This is the position we would have expected Porphyry to take in any case, given the evidence of his Life of Plotinus. But it is important to see that this is not what Avicenna finds distinctive and absurd about Porphyry's views. To the contrary: the identity of intellect with its object is a commonplace in Aristotelian philosophy as it comes down to Avicenna, and Avicenna himself embraces this commonplace, holding that the Active Intellect is in some sense identical with all the intelligibles. (This is the import of his cryptic remark in the second passage that 'in something else, this is possible, as we will discuss in its proper place' - the 'something else' is Active Intellect or in general any separated intellect.) Avicenna's contempt is rather directed at the claim that the rational soul becomes identical with the intelligibles insofar as it engages in intellection.43 Avicenna's objections to this do not depend on arguments from metaphysics or epistemology. Rather, he simply points out that it is in general ridiculous to say that two things, A and B, become identical, having previously been distinct. Either A and B are one and the same thing or they aren't: if they are identical they are never distinct, and 41 Avicenna, al-Shifã': al-nafs , ed. F. Rahman, Avicenna's De anima (London 1959), V. 6, 239.10-241.4. 42 It seems reasonable to identify the work Avicenna discusses with those mentioned in the Fihrist - that there was more than one On intellect and the intelligibles ascribed to Porphyry available in Arabic is scarcely credible. Thus I take the work mentioned in Life of Plotinus, the two translations with this title in the Fihrist , and the work attacked by Avicenna all to refer to the same treatise. Of course none of this admits of certainty, and in any case, as we will see, there is further reason to be cautious about the accuracy of Avicenna's report of its contents. 43 For the contrast between knowledge in the rational soul and in separated intellects, see P. Adamson, 'Non-discursive thought in Avicenna's commentary on the Theology of Aristotle', in Interpreting Avicenna: science and philosophy in medieval Islam, ed. J. McGinnis (Leiden 2004) 87-111.</page><page sequence="18">1 58 STUDIES ON PORPHYRY if they are distinct they can never become identical. This tells us, then, that Porphyry had, in On intellect and the intelligible , not only defended the identity of intellect and its object, but also blurred or entirely eliminated the distinction between the (rational) soul and the intellect. Or at least, that is how Arabic readers including Avicenna interpreted Porphyry. That takes us to the second question: who are the philosophers Avicenna mocks in both passages, who were so fond of Porphyry's treatise and became 'confused' by it? In the first passage he refers to them as mushā'ūn , a term he elsewhere uses for the Baghdad Peripatetics.44 The first scholar to draw attention to these Avicennan passages, J. Finnegan, thus discusses passages from the most famous Baghdad Aristotelian, al-Fārābī, who was in turn drawing on the De intellectu of Alexander, in order to provide a sense of what Avicenna might have been reacting against.45 But I think it is unlikely that al-Fārābī is the immediate target of Avicenna' s remarks. For one thing, al-Fārābī is fairly clear in distinguishing rational soul from the Active Intellect,46 as for that matter is Alexander in De intellectu 47 And in fact when, in his Letter to Kiyã , Avicenna is again critical of the Baghdad Peripatetics, he explicitly exempts al-Fārābī from his obloquy.48 44 On Avicenna' s attitude towards the Peripatetics, see Brown, 'Avicenna and the Christian Philo- sophers in Baghdad' (n.18 above). An epistle by one of Avicenna's students provides evidence of his animus against Ibn al-Tayyib: see D. Gutas, Avicenna and the Aristotelian tradition (Leiden 1988) 67-69. 45 J. Finnegan, S.J., 'Avicenna's refutation of Porphyrius,' Avicenna commemoration volume (Calcutta 1956) 187-203. 46 Like Alexander, al-Fārābī, in his Letter on the intellect (Risàia fi ' l-'aql ), associates soul only with material or potential intellect. Similarly, his Principles of the opinions of the people of the excellent city (ed. and trans. R. Walzer, Al-F arabi on the perfect state [Oxford: 1985], at 198.4-6) mentions a 'human intellect' which is identified as the potential for receiving intelligibles. These positions seem much like Avicenna's own theory in the relevant respects, though they are less fully articulated; and like Avicenna and Alexander al-Fārābī distinguishes soul very clearly from the fully actual Agent Intellect. 47 Alexander is clear that only material intellect is a kind of soul: see Alexander, Mantissa , ed. Bruns, 107.18-19. See also the new English translation, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Supplement to On the Soul , trans. R. W. Sharpies (London 2004). The Arabic version has been published in J. Finnegan, S.J., 'Texte arabe du TTEPI NOT d'Alexandre d'Aphrodise', Mélanges de VUniversite Saint Joseph 33 (1956) 157-202, with this passage at 183.9. Elsewhere Alexander actually contrasts productive intellect - i.e. the intellect that is paradigmatically identical with the intelligibles - with soul; see 108.22-23 in the Greek, 186.22 in the Arabic. 48 See Dimitri Gutas' translation of the Letter in his Avicenna and the Aristotelian tradition (n.44 above) 60-64. 1 think Gutas (62, n. 7) is right to be skeptical of Finnegan' s suggestion that a specific doctrine about material intellect mentioned in the Letter is aligned with the one ascribed to Porphyry in al-Shifã' and al-Ishãrãt. In the Letter Avicenna complains about 'a certain person' who thought the material intellect was identical with the rational soul and also located in the body. As Gutas suggests, he may have Alexander in mind here; Alexander does suggest that intellect may reside in the body and supervene on a bodily mixture (see De intellectu 1 12, 195 in the Arabic). But neither the identity of the rational soul with active intellect, nor the identity of intellect and the intelligibles, is part of the view criticized here by Avicenna.</page><page sequence="19">PETER ADAMSON: PORPHYRIUS ARABUS ON NATURE &amp; ART 159 As Carl Ehrig-Eggert has already pointed out, a more plausible candidate for the authors attacked by Avicenna in the two long passages cited above would be Yahyâ ibn 'Adi and his school.49 Ibn 'Adì is a strong proponent of the identity of intellect and the intelligibles, and in fact he cites Alexander along with Aristotle in support of this thesis.50 As we have seen, though, this is fairly common currency in the Arabic Aristotelian tradition, and is not the position attacked by Avicenna. Rather, Avicenna' s ire is provoked by the claim that soul actually becomes intellect, and thus becomes identical with the intelligibles, having previously been distinct from them. Certain theological treatises written by Ibn 'Adi show that he held such a view. He says, for example: If what is known is compounded from matter and form, then the way it is known (ma'nā al-'ilm bi-hi) is brought about by one of the two parts, either its form (in the soul of the knower) or its matter, without the other. But if [what is known] is simple, and thus a pure form, then the way it is known is the intellect's reception of the form and its becoming that form ( tasawwur al- 'aql bi-hā wa masiru-hu iyya- hā). Then the intellect and the intelligible come to be one and the same, identical in subject (fa-yakūn al-' aql wa 'l-ma'qûl hīna'idhin wãhidan bi-'aynihi fi 7- mawdū').5i At one point Ibn 'Adi goes so far as to suggest that we can actually become united to God's essence, insofar as we come to know Him: We say it is known that we know and intellect (' ãqala ) the Creator, the exalted. Since the knowledge of anything known, and the intellection {'aql) of any intelligible ( bi-kull ma'qül) is the reception of form of what is known by the intellect of the knower ( tasawwur 'aql al-'ālim bi-sūra al-ma'lūm ), it follows that, when we know the Creator, great be His name, our intellects receive His form. But because the Creator, great be His name, is not something that has matter, His form is not [only a] part of His essence. It follows necessarily that His form is His essence. Therefore, His essence is in our intellects. And because the intellect in act and the intelligible in act are one and the same thing in the subject ( mawdü '), as Aristotle has made clear [...] it is necessary that when we intellect the Creator, the exalted, our intellects are united to Him.52 It seems possible then that the mashshā'ūn attacked by Avicenna are specifically the Christian Baghdad Peripatetics: Yahyâ ibn 'Adi and his followers. But we need to be 49 See Ehrig-Eggert, Die Abhandlung (n. 25 above) 85-86 ('Diese von Avicenna referierte Theorie . . . entspricht natürlich auch den Ausführungen von Yahyä ibn 'Adi'). 50 E.

This surprising thesis is put forward in order to soften up the reader for accepting that God could take human form in the Incarnation.</page><page sequence="20">1 60 STUDIES ON PORPHYRY cautious here in drawing any conclusions about the contents of Porphyry's treatise itself. Certainly Ibn 'Adì would have had no need to rely on Porphyry for the commonly held notion that intellect is identical with the intelligibles. As for the more controversial claim that intellect becomes identical with the intelligibles, this can be found in Alexander,53 a text Ibn 'Adì certainly knew. And in fact this claim might be thought to fit badly with Porphyry's presumed goal in the refutation of Longinus, namely showing that intellect is not distinct from its objects. After all, the idea that it becomes identical with them assumes that it is, at least sometimes, distinct from them. So I am inclined to be skeptical as to how much of the doctrine Avicenna reports as being that of Porphyry is genuinely Porphyrian. Certainly Avicenna gives us the impression that he has read the work itself, and found it wanting ('it is utter drivel'). Nevertheless, what we find in the passages from al-Shifā * and al-I skārāt quoted above may not be based directly on the Arabic version of On intellect and the intelligible , but instead on some work, perhaps from Ibn 'Adì' s school, that summarized Porphyry's position but combined it with elements from Alexander.54 In that case we should be very careful in assuming that what Avicenna reports is an accurate summary of the Arabic or Syriac versions of On intellect and the intelligible , never mind of the original Greek work written against Longinus. 53 109.9-10: 'in thinking it comes to be the same as the things that are thought, but when not think- ing it is other than they (vowv pèv yàp ò aÙTÔç yíverai Totç vooupévoiç, pq vocov 8è àXXoç èaiiv aÙTwv, Sharpies trans.)'. The Arabie here reads 'when it [sc. intellect] thinks them, it and the intelligibles come to be one and the same {kãna huwa wa 'l-ma'qûlât shay' an wãhidan ), but when it does not think them, it comes to be other than them' (187.10-11). Actually here the verb kãna , which translates yivcTai, can also mean 'to be' yielding 'intellect is the same' rather than ' comes to be the same'. But the ambiguity hardly matters, because the passage is clear that intellect is sometimes identical with its objects, and sometimes not; this is the thesis refuted by Avicenna. 54 Notice that Avicenna says in the first passage cited above that Porphyry 'was contradicted by one of the people of his time' and that he responded to this critic. This would seem to show that he at least knew the treatise to be a work of refutation (that is, of Longinus).</page><page sequence="21">PETER ADAMSON: PORPHYRIUS ARABUS ON NATURE &amp; ART 1 6 1 Appendix 2: Porphyry in Miskawayh's al-Fawz al-Asghar We have seen above that Porphyry's Commentary on the Physics was certainly available in Arabic, and known to authors writing in the 10th century. I suspect that this commentary may have been the text used by Miskawayh, a rough contemporary of Avicenna (he died in 421/1030), in writing his al-Fawz al-Asghar ( The shorter 'Triumph').55 The Fawz is a wide-ranging summary of Miskawayh's Neoplatonic views on God, the soul, and prophecy. In it Miskawayh mentions Porphyry by name twice, a fact which seems to have gone unnoticed in previous literature on Porphyry in Arabic (and which I myself was fortunate to come upon only after writing the main body of this paper).56 The fragments are not included in Smith's collection. In both passages, Miskawayh stresses that he has taken the material he presents directly from Porphyry. The first passage emphasizes the obviousness of the principle that every motion requires a mover. The topic here is what leads me to guess that Miskawayh is citing from the Physics commentary, if he is indeed citing from a genuine work. The second passage is longer and more interesting. It consists of the entirety of the fifth section (fasi) of the first topic (mas 'ala) of the treatise, the topic being God. It concludes with an explicit claim that the section is taken directly from Porphyry. The content is a discussion of God's uniqueness, and the traditional difficulty of explaining how a single agent can produce a multiplicity of acts or effects.57 1 translate the passages in full here. Passage 1: Fawz 40.9-41.3 Porphyry said the following, this being a literal quotation of his words (hikãya alfãzihi ): 'One of the principles clear to the intellect, which is affirmed by every- one who adheres to the truth among the Greeks, is that nothing comes into being without a cause, nor is anything moved set in motion without a mover distinct from itself. For those who say that we do find motion without a cause are people who deserve no notice. The evidence of the eyes plunges them into contradiction repeatedly, and yet they also fail to build this statement of theirs on any basis ( asl ), or to pay heed to the first principle (awwal) of their own intellects. Instead, they fall into contradiction by building their view on an unsound foundation. Then, when they see that they are refuted, they are forced to posit this false basis, stubbornly going against their own intellects. We do not see fit to argue with this sort of person, or propose to speak to someone whose intellect is stuck at the 55 Edited and translated into French in Miskawayh, al-Fawz al-Asghar [Le Petit Livre du Salut], ed. S. 'Udayma, trans. R. Arnaldez (Tunis 1987). 56 Also since completing the paper, I have had the opportunity to read Michael Chase's article 'Did Porphyry Write a Commentary on Aristotle's Posterior Analytics ? Albertus Magnus, Farabi and Porphyry on per se predication', in Classical Arabic philosophy: sources and reception , ed. P. Adamson (London 2007) 21-38. Chase draws on material in Albert the Great to argue that Porphyry may have written a commentary on the Posterior Analytics, and that this commentary may have been known to al-Fārābī. 57 Cf. fragment Smith 465F, from Shahrastānī, also on the topic of the mediation of the simple divine action.</page><page sequence="22">1 62 STUDIES ON PORPHYRY [lowest] natural limit, until he has strengthened his view, improved, and had the help of habituation, practice, and perseverance in clinging to the truth.' This is the text of Porphyry's statement. Passage 2: Fawz 48.6-50.9 That [God] is one is clear in the following way. We say that if there were more than one Agent, then it would follow that they were composed. For they would share in common that they are agents, while differing in themselves [or 'in their essences': bi-'l-dhawât ]. Obviously, that in virtue of which one differs from the other is not the same as that by virtue of which they are alike. It is thus necessary that each one of them is composed of substance and difference (fasi). But com- position is a motion, because it is some effect Ç athar ), and obviously is from a cause C mu'aththir ), as shown above. It is thus necessary that the agent have an agent, and this repeatedly, until infinity. So necessarily, one must go back to a single Agent. But once one has verified that the Agent is one, a doubt and difficulty arises on this topic, namely that someone might say: 'how is it possible that many different acts arise from a single agent, especially since some of those acts are mutually contradictory? For it is clear that that which is one and simple performs an act that is one and simple.' We say that there are four ways in which a single agent may perform many different acts. First, that [the agent] is composed of many parts and faculties. Second, that its acts are performed upon different matters. Third, that it [acts] by means of different instruments. And fourth, that its acts are not by means of itself, but by means of the mediation of other things. What is composed of many parts and faculties is like man, who performs some of his acts by means of desire, some by means of irascibility, and some by means of intellect. What performs many actions by means of many instruments is like the carpenter, who uses both adze and drill. The agent that performs many acts on different matters is like fire, which makes iron pliant but hardens clay. The one that performs many different acts, some through itself, and others through the intermediary of things other than it in an accidental fashion, is like snow, which is cold by itself, but may heat accidentally and through the intermediary of something else. For this cooling induces condensation and constriction, so that the heat is retained, and something cooled is heated. Thus snow heats through the intermediary of something else. It is impossible that the first Agent have many faculties, because they would necessarily be a multiplicity and composition; but this we have refuted. Nor is it possible that He perform many actions through many instruments, because those instruments would need to be either acted upon, or not. And if they are acted upon, then how would His act be one? From this, too, would result that there was a multiplicity in what is one (al-wãhid), and this is absurd. But if they are not acted upon, then it would as a result be necessary that there was an effect without a cause. And this is absurd, as we have shown. Nor is it possible that there is a multiplicity of acts due to a multiplicity of matters, because it holds for the matters that they are either acted upon or not, so the argument here will be like the</page><page sequence="23">PETER ADAMSON: PORPHYRIUS ARABUS ON NATURE &amp; ART 163 preceding one. It remains only to say that the reason for the multiplicity of acts is that what is one performs some of His acts through Himself, and some through the intermediary of some other thing or things. The first to hold this view, according to what Porphyry says, was Aristotle. For he said that Plato had spoken of Form, and so admitted multiplicity. It is then clear from this discussion ( madhhab ) that [God] is a single, first [reading awwal] agent. Everything related in this section is only from Porphyry.</page></plain_text>
