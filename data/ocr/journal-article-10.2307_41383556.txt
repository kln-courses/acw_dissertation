<plain_text><page sequence="1">Цешеил cuia Gtáticiim Books About Russia [The brief reviews in this issue are by Helen R. Sattley, Kathryn E. Hodapp, R. Will Burnett, Elizabeth Guilfoile, Frances E. Whitehead, and Hannah M. Lindahl.] At this time when the two most powerful countries of all the ages are watching each other with sus- picion and with fear, it seemed to this reviewer that the only way to review a new informative book on one of those countries, Russia, was to compare and contrast it with similar books already available about that country. To this end, discus- sions of four books, the new one and three older titles, are herein given. Irina Aleksander was born in St. Petersburg, where she studied law after the Revolution. She came to America in 1941. Her book is prin- cipally a history book, although at the first of it she takes you "through sixteen republics at full speed." But the emphasis is on past history and this is given vividly and well. It reads like a storybook. Sixth graders will read it with ease and high school people will still find it interesting. This history really stops at the Rev- olution, although there, are a few pages on the Five- Year Plans, of the city built by young people who traveled to the Soviet Far East, four hundred miles from the nearest rail- road station in order to build a ship- building port safe from Japanese in- vasion, and a mention of Russian battles of World War II. But there is really no picture of present day Russia. It is illustrated throughout with decorative black and white pic- tures, includes one colored double- spread map and brilliant story-telling end-papers. There is no index. In 1944, J. B. Lippincott published The Land of the Russian Рею pie, one book in its Portraits of the Nations Series (156 pages, $2.00). Alexander Nazaroff, the author, was born in Russia, but has been an American citizen for many years. The first half of his book is a picture of the Soviets of today laid against their ancient history. The last half is his- tory down to World War II. This is briefly but well told and the back- ground for the Revolution is clearly pictured as well as what it cost in suffering and in lives. There is men- 1 Aleksander, Irina, This Is Russia. Illustrated by Andrei Hudiakoflf. David McKay, 1947, $3.00, (112 pages). 328</page><page sequence="2">Review and Criticism 329 tion of the place of the church today and as it was immediately after the Revolution; there is a brief summary of the work of the state and the work of the individual in relation to it; and an explanation that though elections are secret only Communists or no-party men whom the Com- munists approve of may run for of- fice. Speaking of the Communist party, Nazaroff writes, ". . . that party controls all press, literaturé, and education in the Soviet Union. And it does not allow the expression of views on fundamental political and economic matters of which it disap- proves." The book ends on the rapid development of the rich economic resources of the country and on the confidence of the people in their own abilities. There are many fine photo- graphs for illustration and there is an index. Dorothy Erskine wrote Russia's Story (Thomas Y. Crowell, 154 pages, $2.50) in 1946 after exten- sive traveling in the Soviet Union. She is an American, wife of a San Francisco attorney. Her book is illus- trated with many explanatory graphs and black and white drawings by Bob Smith. The emphasis is on geog- raphy and resources, although there are two chapters on history. The Soviets are covered by general de- scriptions of life in the Arctic, on the Steppes, in Moscow, and on a farm; and there is one chapter on "Their Government - The Business State." This describes the partner- ship of people and government, but with these reservations: "With meth- ods of dictatorship as stern as those of Peter the Great, Stalin has mod- ernized Russia," and "The Revolu- tion" has proclaimed and carried out racial equality. It has given count- less multitudes education and oppor- tunity to rise. It has provided social security in the modern, industrial age. But as yet there has not been established the freedom of speech, press, and assembly, valued so highly in this country and part of our own Constitution." It is a good reference book with its chapters subdivided into smaller subjects and an index. Anna Louise Strong went to Russia in 1921 with the American Friends Service. Ever since, she has been working for better relations between the US and the USSR, the country of her husband. Her book, Peoples of the USSR, was published in 1944 (Macmillan, 246 pages, illustrated with photographs, $2.50). A short history of the past leads into separate chapters on the individual Soviets and in each of these later chapters the present is contrasted vividly with the past. There are really three per- iods, the past, the changes wrought</page><page sequence="3">330 Elementary English by the New Russia, and the terrible destruction of the German invasion. Struggle is indeed portrayed through- out the book, but there seems to be almost too much smoothness to the accomplishments of the present Rus- sian government. Too little emphasis is given to the internal struggles of , the successful dictatorship; too much amiability is displayed on the part of all the peoples. But this, too, is an important book, for here before us is another picture of a country rich in people and rich in resources and the only lasting bridge between that country and ours will be the bridge of understanding built upon the foundations of knowledge. Let us know our materials. Let us realize their importance. - Helen R. Sattley For Early Adolescents Judith of France . By Margaret Leighton. Illustrated by Henry C. Pitz. Houghton, $2.50. Judith, a granddaughter of Charle- magne, is ever conscious of what her name presages in beauty and woe. She is sworn and determined to pre- vent internecine warfare. The mar- riage pawn of her father, she is first wedded to the old Anglo Saxon king; later (and forcibly) to her eldest stepson, and finally to the brave war- rior Bras de Fer, foe of the Vikings and protector of the French kingdom. The book never softens in recount- ing life in those medieval days: rela- tionships of family and of church and state are all set forth. Judith's devotion to her oath is steadfast and admirable. The illustrations add further to a period no whit lacking in pageantry. - F.E.W. Кие Plays the Game . By Josephine Blackstock. Putnam, $2.50. A naive 18 year old Rue is headed for Chicago and a large Physical Ed. College. To Aunt Laura the emphasis of play directing is on the play. Only an all-A record will legitimize Rue's stay. . With settlement work in off- hours, and perpetual twinges of homesickness, the book over-senti- mentalizes. Rue too consistently "gets the breaks." The sentimental slant is much too decided and the vocabulary lacks freshness. A com- bination career, school and love story, this has informational, imagi- native and entertainment value, but it is not comparable with the author's earlier Island on the Beam. - F.E.W. Rabbits. By Herbert S. Zim. Illus- trated by Joy Buba. Morrow, $2.00. Dr. Zim is providing good service to children through his excellent books that provide information as exciting as fairy stories. Rabbits is no Peter Rabbit story.</page><page sequence="4">Review and Criticism 331 It is an absorbing, and factual, ac- count of what rabbits are, what they eat, how they build their nests, and how they live. It describes various kinds of rabbits from the tailless "pika" to the common "cotton tail." Its chief interest to children will be in the information it provides on how to keep, feed, and care for rab- bits as pets. The text is simple. The book ap- pears to be poorly illustrated, how- ever, for the age group that would find the material readable and of value. The type and the illustrations appear designed for primary grade youngsters. The writing, both in content and in form, is for children in the upper elementary grades. For such children the book is highly to be recommended. May Dr. Zim give us more like it. - R.W.B. Antik, The Life Story of a Beaver . By Luis M. Henderson. Illustrated by the author. Morrow, $2.50. Amik (Chippewa for beaver) is a naturalist's account of the days of a beaver. Beautifully illustrated by the author, this excellent book is a fascinating chronicle of the child- hood and adult activities of a beaver. "What happens to him might well happen to any beaver and through him we shall share in beaver joys and sorrows - ." There is no anthropomorphism in this book. Mr. Henderson fully ad- mits he has "given Amik the power to reason, for he gives every proof of having it." But the account is through the eyes of a trained observer and is presented with a gifted pen. Here is one of the most absorbing children's books the reviewer has seen. The mood of the woods and still ponds is in it. It is a warm and open-hearted book. Its color, drama, and suspense will captivate the jun- ior reader. Its honesty and faithful reporting make the book an im- portant addition to any library for children in which books are selected for their value to the widening hori- zons of childhood. - R.W.B. Nature Quests and Quizzes. By Ray- mond Tifft Fuller. No illustra- tions. John Day, $1.50. The book is in two parts. The first part consists of one-hundred "quests." Each quest is an explora- tion in nature to determine, for ex- ample, how to find a hummingbird's nest or to watch a skunk family at play and at work. The second part consists of one-hundred nature ques- tions (with the answers printed up- side down to keep one from peeking.) The one hundred field experiences range over a wide variety of possible contacts with nature. About all the</page><page sequence="5">332 Elementary English book provides the novice is one hun- dred ideas of areas to investigate. For example, under the heading "Identifying 25 Wild Flowers" is the following information: "This is one of the best roads into the land of nature knowledge. An especially good way to start being at home in the world." Under the heading, "Finding 2 Species of Mole and 1 Shrew," is the following (as in the foregoing, reported in its entirety) : "The shrew is the smallest mammal there is. Too many people think they are moles. Apparently little is known of the habits of both these little mammals." These two examples are completely typical of the aid the hopeful na- turalist can expect in his "quests." - R.W.B. Febold F e bol d s on; Tall Tales from the Great Plains . By Paul R. Beath, compiler. Illustrated by Lynn Trank. University of Nebraska Press, $2.75. The legendary Swede of the Ne- braska plains is the hero of these tall tales. In one episode after another he performs feats which could only have been accomplished in the early days of American expansion. Well told by a student of American lan- guage and literature, they lack a continuity of character which might have been achieved had the compiler set out to writç a story of Feboldson rather than collect the various stories about him in their separate units. Boys think the separate stories very funny, though, and this promises to be a popular addition to our folklore collections. Illustrations and format delightful and most appropriate. - H.R.S. Watch for a Tall White Sail . By Mar- garet E. Bell. Frontispiece by Louis Darling. William Morrow, $2.50. An older girl's novel which can well take its place beside Rose Wilder Lane's Let the Hurricane Roar. In portrayal of character and in the picture of the beauty and the cruelty of wilderness country, these books are parallel. When Florence Monroe reluctantly boarded the boat at Vic- toria, B.C., she had no idea she was following romance to her new home in Alaska. But guiding the tall white sail ahead, as it raced her steamer, was Beldon Craig. Later, his visits were to break the monotony and drudgery of her life at her father's saltery where she went to keep house for her brothers and once, when win- ter set in too soon, the sight of the white sail was to mean rescue and a safe voyage home. Girls of today will understand and admire this Florence of 1887 who grew to love</page><page sequence="6">Review and Criticism 333 the challenge of a pioneer country even while it offered hardships. - H.R.S. The Little White Horse . By Elizabeth Goudge. Illustrated by Walter Hodges. Coward - McCann, $2.50. Many girls of ten to fifteen will revel in the story of Merry Merry- weather, who dwelt in a castle in the West Country of England a hundred years ago. Some there are, the more literal- minded, who will be unable to accept this mixture of fantasy and reality. But the beautiful prose of Elizabeth Goudge has the same bewitching quality in her books for children as in Green Dolphin Street and Pilgrim's Inn. The imaginative souls will count the world well lost for a few hours with Merry and her inimitable com- panions; Sir Wolf, the Lord of Moon- acre Manor; Miss Heliotrope, the governess; Old Parson with his fiddle; the dwarf-like cook Marma- duke Scarlet; Zachariah, too wise for a mere cat; and the great dog who all suspect may be a lion. E. G. All Conference Tackle. By C. Paul Jackson. Crowell, $2.50. High school boys, and girls too, will like this story of inter-collegiate football written by a man who knows the game. Mr. Jackson knows people too. He draws a vivid picture of Larry Shane, who overcomes his greatest obstacle to good team work, Barry Shane. The big freshman from an exclusive eastern prep school learns more than the art of tackling in his first season with Coach Steve Foster's middle western team. He learns that men are men, by right of their own worth and efforts, not by virtue of name, racial background, or inheri- tance. When he learns this lesson, he really makes good in football. E. G. Dark House on the Moss . By Con- stance Savery. Decorations by Clifford N. Geary. Longmans, $2.50. Two orphans, Periwinkle and Louis Courtenay, are forced by circum- stance to live with an unknown Uncle Morville in the "Dark House on the Moss." Mysterious happen- ings on the nearby marsh, the ap- parent hatred of their uncle by his tenants, and a new uninhabited vil- lage claim the interest of the children. On the night the marsh breaks loose and entraps the sleeping villagers, Uncle Morville becomes a hero and is vindicated. Nineteenth century English story by the author of Enemy Brothers and The Good Ship Red Lily. -K.E.H. Bittersweet. By Martha Barnhart Harper. Decorations by Erick Berry. Longmans, $2.50.</page><page sequence="7">334 Elementary English Bitter though sweet after all is the life and romance during Civil war times of Lucy Barnhart and her young minister friend, Nathan Roth, who answers Lincoln's call to arms, though not to return. The common- place things of everyday living of a large family on a Pennsylvania farm, and the stirring movement of history, are all held together by the story of Lucy who finds her adjustment through helping others. Based on real stories of the author's family. - K.E.H. For the Middle Grades Windy Foot at the County Fair. By Frances Frost. Illustrated by Lee Townsend. Whittlesey House, $2.00. The entire Clark family spends a wonderful week at the County Fair. Toby, the twelve year old, enters his Shetland pony, Windy Foot, in the races. The children have many ad- ventures which include meeting new friends and enemies, winning a coveted doll for Betsy, watching the races through the "dime hole" and the running of the pony race which Toby wins. An interesting part of American life presented by a popular author. - K.E.H . For Younger Children Twelve O'clock "Whistle. By Jerrold Beim and Ernest Crichlow. Wil- liam Morrow, $2.00. One small boy wanted to make autos just like his father, but the day he carried the forgotten lunch pail to the plant he discovered that it takes many men working together to make even one auto. We follow with him the different stages of the assembly line and see the finished cars roll off and we learn with him an im- portant lesson in cooperation. A small picture book in black and white which delights all boys and girls who like mechanical toys and who dream some day of owning "live" ones. - H.R.S. While Susie Sleeps. By Nina Schnei- der. Pictures by Dagmar Wilson. William R. Scott, $1.50. Foť the young reader, this book is informative as well as entertaining. The story portrays what happens while Susie sleeps. Insects and little animals crawl and scurry about. Street lights glow. The policeman watches stories and houses; the baker bakes the bread for the next day; the engi- neer guides the train as it rushes through the night. Milkmen prepare the milk for the morning delivery, and printers print the morning pa- per. Susie awakens to a world in which important work has been done for her and her family while they slept. - H.M.L.</page><page sequence="8">Review and Criticism yy 5 Boppet ! Please Stop It! By Ida Bin- ney. Illustrated by the author. Wil- liam R. Scott, $1.50. A little old lady who lived in a quiet house felt lonely at times. One day she bought a lively, playful puppy named Boppet who changed the quiet, orderly house into a place of noise and confusion. Finally, the lit- tle, old lady decided that Boppet needed a child for a playmate. In a home for children, she selected Tim- othy Toppe t who was lively and play- ful. Timothy Toppet and Boppet romped and played all day long. In fact, they played so hard that by evening they were both ready for bed and slept the whole night through. Once more the little old lady had peace and quiet. Young children will enjoy this rollicking tale. - H.M.L. Spoodles, the Puppy Who Learned . By Irma Simonton Black. Pictures by Johnny Whistle. William R. Scott, $1.25. Spoodles, who was so named be- cause he looked like both a spaniel and a poodle, was left alone in the house one day when the family went away. The mischief that grew out of his efforts to escape loneliness is dramatically related in story and pic- tures that will appeal to the very young child. - H.M.L. The Picture Dictionary for Children . Revised and newly illustrated by Garnette Waiters and S. A. Cour- tis. Grossett and Dunlop, $1.25. This revised edition of a very pop- ular book for children in the primary gradeis will be ^welcomed by the countless friends of earlier editions. The expanded vocabulary, the new illustrations, and the extra color on every page are added features of this latest edition. The book is a valua- ble learning tool for younger children, for through the presentation of words and pictures the child devel- ops correct concepts of unfamiliar words. - H.M.L.
