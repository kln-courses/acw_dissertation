<plain_text><page sequence="1">London Much well-deserved publicity is now being given to Peterlee New Town, an estate of houses designed by Frank Dixon, Peter Daniel and Victor Pasmore, where every element - buildings, roads and landscape - is conceived as part of a vast design. It is the first time that such a project has been planned so radically and completely in England (at any rate in modern times) and therefore deserves publicizing even though it is not a new concept in other countries. The chief instigator in the Peterlee project has probably been Victor Pasmore whose exhibition at the New London Gallery in March allowed us to see how his abstract 'constructions' compared with his archi- tectural schemes. The feature most com- mon to all his work is the use of white, enlivened by and contrasted with black, and the juxtaposition of simple geometric shapes in two or three dimensions. This creates an impression of purity and sim- plicity. Some of his paintings, entitled Curvilinear and Rectilinear Motifs, consist of straight and curved lines deeply engraved into a ground of white cellulose paint where an occasional band of shining black provides a focal point. In other pictures two large and irregular colour shapes sit on a white surface and are separated by a thick black line so that the whole com- position looks like some strange mathema- tical fraction. The second aspect of Pasmore's work is three-dimensional. Relief Constructions and Spacial Constructions com- posed of strips of wood painted in black, white and colour are brought together into vertical reliefs strongly resembling plans for a complex building site or early maquettes for a skyscraper; at the same time they can be viewed as purely abstract designs on the borderline between painting and sculpture. Paul Rebeyrolle is both a realist and an abstract painter: recognizable shapes em- erge out of abstract mosaics of colour, or become lost in a featureless mass. The exact character of his work is difficult to define and, as can be seen in the exhibi- tion of his recent paintings at Marlborough Fine Art (until I5th April), defies any strict categorization. Born in 1926, and until quite recently a 'realist', these latest works have earned him a large following in France and notoriety as one of the newest and most exciting painters of the School of Paris. He paints landscapes, some peopled with lovers, others with birds, cats or frogs. But neither his land- scapes nor his figures are real. They appear as violent explosions of colour. The recurrent theme of barely recognizable embracing lovers is conveyed by strokes of hot red lying within a deep, cool sea of green grass. Rebeyrolle's fine sense of colour draws the spectator into limitless vistas. His pictures are deeply sensual dreams and fantastic visions of nature interpreted in a very personal way. Yet there is no hidden meaning in them, and in this sense the paintings are simpler to understand than they might seem at first. The poetical evocations of the School of Paris were seen last month in the work of Alfred Aberdam at the Molton Gallery. He is a highly competent painter whose subtle use of pale, colourless figures set against a pitch black curtain suggests a timeless space where vague figures and horses are discovered floating about. Elongated figures, whose extremities be- come spiky filaments of flesh, are remotely descended from the Gothic and El Greco. The large Retrospective Exhibition of sculpture by Leon Underwood at the Kaplan Gallery was quite an event, for this was the sculptor's first major show even though he is 70 this year and has been working since before the First World War. Like many artists of his gene- ration, Underwood was moved and in- spired by Primitive sculpture and especially by that of the West African, Mayan and Aztec civilizations. During the I92o's and I930's he directed his energies, as Henry Moore did, to the human figure conceived as rising out of a solid block of polished marble, stone or wood. These heavy, solid forms were only indirectly inspired by primitive art but in a few works such as the series of Masks and the Totem to the Artist the derivation is far more obvious. For the past fifteen years he has concentrated on working in bronze and his style has undergone radical changes. From massive, compact forms he has turned to emaciated figures whose flattened, elongated limbs dance with expressive energy and harmonic move- ment. The intricate interplay of forms and lines resulting in rhythmic arabesques of bronze in space is expertly conceived and often delightful to watch, but to claim that his art was impressive would be an exaggeration. Strength and sensitivity were the hall- marks of Henryk Gotlib's work which was on view last month at the Crane Kalman Gallery. Born in Poland in I892, he came to live in England in 1939 and has had his share of success here even though he has always preferred to ignore contemporary artistic movements. There is something of the Nabis, of Bonnard especially, in his work, transformed and invigorated by a German Expressionist temperament. This is, in no way, a reactionary art but a new and bold application of old methods that descend unashamedly from the Old Masters. The two English masters of portraiture in this century are surely Augustus John and Sutherland, and the exhibition at Arthur Tooth offered us a number of important works by the older artist never seen previously, including portraits, figure studies, landscapes, still lifes and drawings. As a portrait painter, we were immediately struck by John's two styles. In the exhibi- tion a number of pictures of prominent people such as Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother (1940) and Vivien Leigh (1942), though unfinished, showed evidence of a sleek finish and even lack of real charac- terization which tended to date them very quickly. In contrast to these, the Self- portrait (1946) was a masterpiece of rough brushwork and extraordinary colour.

Augustus John displayed his excellent draughtsmanship in many beautiful figure studies. Unlike certain passing phases in twen- tieth-century art, Surrealism has been more than just a step in the evolution of the modern aesthetic; it is a philosophy of life. Many different forms of Surrealism have, therefore, been developed and in the exhibition 'Ernst to Matta' at the Obelisk Gallery, Crawford Street, we can observe the tortuous evolutions of this art. Even though there are only twenty-five works, the principal exponents are represented in this impressive little show. De Chirico is one of the forerunners and an Intirieur au Temple Grec (1926) is a good example of his Pittura Metafisica. Max Ernst, another founder of the movement, is represented by the majestic Personnages, dont un sans Tite (1928) painted almost entirely in sky blue and orange where ghostly figures dissolve into ectoplasmic shapes. Paul Delvaux, the leader of the Belgian group, relies, in such pictures as De Geramten, on excessive realism to emphasize the strange- ness of six skeletons quietly conversing in a doctor's office. Matta is today the leading Surrealist and his paintings differ widely from those of the first generation. His works are more direct products of the imagination, they are quite abstract and consist of anthropomorphic, biological shapes exploding in bursts of colour that suggest weird space fictions. There are also works by Hans Arp, Joan Mir6, Rene Magritte, Andre Masson, Yves Tanguy, Dali, Hans Bellmer, Victor Brauner, Oscar Dominguez, Wilfredo Lam and Wolfgang Paalen in the exhibition that continues until the middle of April. Carel Weight, A.R.A., whose recent pic- tures are on view at the Zwemmer Gallery (until 6th April), has had much official suc- cess and recognition. The exhibition, called 'Ghosts, Marvels, Moments and Scenes of Foreign Lands', consists largely of agree- able landscapes presenting a facile and happy view of nature. The London scenes show Weight at his best with convincingly familiar effects of sky, lighting and weather. His pictures are always enlivened by figures but their stumpy bodies and lack of proper drawing betray the artist's tech- nical shortcomings. He is a completely honest painter who presents a pleasant and uncomplicated view of his surround- ings. The Reid Gallery, Cork Street, has in its Spring Exhibition (until I5th April) some attractive examples of nineteenth and twentieth-century drawings and water- colours by Boudin, Pissarro, Renoir, Signac, Picasso, Modigliani and Segonzac. A Degas black chalk drawing of a violinist which is a preparatory study for the pastel The Dancing Class: Exercises at the Barre of 1877/8 (Havemeyer Coll., New York) is a superb work of the very highest quality. Were it only for this drawing the exhibi- tion should not be missed. The Arts Council, St James's Square, has a show (until 22nd April) of Modern French Bookbindings. The majority of the bindings have in common the use of intri- cate geometric designs and abstract blocks of colour and they all try to reflect the text and the illustrations of the book concerned. The forty-first exhibition of early English water-colours and drawings at the Fine Arts Society runs from 12th to 29th April. MICHEL STRAUSS</page></plain_text>
