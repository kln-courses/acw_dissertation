<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Bulgaria, 2006 Season IVO D. CHOLAKOV AND KRASTYU CHUKALEV The "Archaeology in Bulgaria, 2006 Season" news- letter presents data in summary form concerning all archaeological sites investigated in 2006, as well as brief reports on specific archaeological excavations. Reports are arranged geographically from west to east and from north to south.* INTRODUCTION This first publication in the AJA of a newsletter describing archaeological excavations and investiga- tions in Bulgaria requires a brief introduction to the chronological system used in Bulgarian archaeology. The relative chronology includes four main periods: prehistoric, ancient, Medieval, and post-Medieval. Therefore, we need to present these periods with their chronological limits expressed in absolute dates. Prehistory in Bulgaria encompasses five periods: Paleolithic, Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Bronze Age, and Early Iron Age. The earliest traces of human pres- ence are from the Early Paleolithic period (900,000- 1,000,000 b.p.), and were discovered in the Kozarnika cave, in the Belogradchik region of northwest Bulgar- ia.1 Traces of the Middle Paleolithic period, which in Bulgaria dates from 67,000 to 47,000 b.p., were discov- ered at several sites: Devetashka cave, Bacho Kiro cave, Shiroka Poliana, Samuilica 2, Temnata cave, Muselievo, Devnja, Beloslav, Razgrad, and Dikilitash.2 The begin- ning of the Late Paleolithic period is considered to be before 43,000 b.p., in the case of the Bacho Kiro cave, and 46,000 b.p., according to finds from the Temnata cave. The end of this period is dated ca. 13,000 b.p., also on the basis of finds in these two caves.3 The earli- est radiocarbon dates place the Neolithic around the end of the seventh through the entire sixth millenni- um B.C.E.4 The successor to the Neolithic period, the Chalcolithic, spans the entire fifth millennium B.C.E.5 In western Bulgaria and the Rhodope Mountains, the Chalcolithic period continues into the first few centu- ries of the fourth millennium B.C.E.6 The Bronze Age in Bulgaria comprises the years 3500 to 1200 B.C.E.,7 and the Early Iron Age extends from the middle of the 11th to the sixth century B.C.E.8 Antiquity in Bulgaria is the period between the founding of Greek colonies along the Thracian Black Sea coast in the sixth century B.C.E. and the beginning of the seventh century C.E., when the reforms of the emperor Heraclius (610-641 C.E.) marked the end of antiquity in the Eastern Roman empire. The Medieval period begins around the middle of the seventh century C.E. and ends in the 17th century. The time after this is the post-Medieval period. SUMMARY OF EXCAVATIONS The following analysis summarizes the diverse data from the archaeological excavations in Bulgaria in 2006. The conclusions drawn from the data can be helpful for representing the current state of Bulgar- ian archaeology and optimal planning of fieldwork. Future annual statistical data in the AJA and ApxeonozuR will supplement the trends outlined here. In 2006, 218 excavations were conducted in Bulgaria (figs. 1,2). Figure 2 shows the breakdown by period, with enumeration of sites that encompass more than one period. The ancient sites are the most numerous, although the period between the sixth century B.C.E. and the sixth century C.E. is as long as the Medieval pe- riod and much shorter than prehistory. This is probably because in Bulgaria, there are statistically many more ancient sites compared with other time periods. Figure 3 illustrates the types of sites investigated in 2006. One site has no clear archaeological structures. Table 1 shows that in each period, settlements account * We collected data regarding all archaeological sites dis- cussed in the text during the session of annual reports of the National Institute of Archaeology and Museum at the Bulgar- ian Academy of Sciences (NIAM-BAS), 19 February-2 March 2007, at which the results of archaeological investigations con- ducted in 2006 were presented. Complete statistical data from these investigations will be published in the journal Archeolo- giahy the end of 2008.

Production centers are the fewest by period - the ancient one is from the Roman period, the Medieval-period one is from the First Bulgarian kingdom - because they are difficult to investigate by virtue of their nature, and as a rule, they do not yield attractive finds like those discovered in tumular necropoleis. Another discrepancy that il- lustrates this is the large number of investigated necro- poleis compared with studies of settlement sites from all periods except antiquity. The archaeological investigations in 2006 included regular excavations and rescue projects: 128 were regu- lar studies (58.7% of all excavations); 90 were rescue projects (41 .3% of all excavations) . During the last few years, the number of rescue excavations has increased because of intensive construction in most cities and the creation of a new national infrastructure. We expect this number to increase further in the future. The number of new sites excavated in 2006 amounts to 87 (39.9% of the total) . The distribution of new sites according to type is as follows: 1 Paleolithic site (0.5%) , 42 settlements (19.4%), 36 necropoleis (16.6%), and 7 cult sites of various character (3.2%) . One site is with- out clear archaeological structures. Of the new sites, 27 (31%) were investigated through regular excavation; the other 60 (69%) were investigated through rescue. The number of new excavations likely will increase steadily, mostly because intensive construction activity requires rescue efforts. The number of sites that have been investigated for more than a year is 131 (60.1 % of the total) . The distri- bution according to type is as follows: 1 Paleolithic site (0.5%), 87 settlements (40.1%), 14 necropoleis (6.5%), 27 cult sites of various character (12.4%), and 2 pro- duction centers (0.9%). A total of 30 (23%) of these are rescue excavations; the remaining 101 (77%) are regular excavations. Archaeological excavations and investigations, in- cluding field surveys, were conducted by archaeologists from the largest scientific institution for archaeology in Bulgaria (the National Institute of Archaeology and Museum at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences [NIAM-BAS]), the major Bulgarian universities, and local museums (fig. 4) . Excavations were conducted by 85 (39%) experts from NIAM-BAS, 100 (45.9%) from local museums, and 33 (15.1%) from universities.</page><page sequence="3">2008] ARCHAEOLOGY IN BULGARIA, 2006 SEASON 145 Fig. 2. Total number of archaeological excavations in Bulgaria in 2006. Six foreign teams participated in archaeological projects for all periods (in 2.8% of all excavations) ; no field surveys were conducted. Four (1.9%) prehistoric and two (0.9%) ancient sites were investigated with the participation of foreign teams. The two Paleolithic sites were studied in collaboration with a French team. Four (1.9%) settlements were excavated by Bulgarian and foreign archaeologists, including a Chalcolithic tell by a Bulgarian-Greek team, a Bronge Age tell by a Bulgarian-Japanese team, one ancient settlement by a Bulgarian-Polish team, and another ancient settlement by a team of Bulgarian, English, Czech, and French members. All investigations with foreign teams were regular excavations, five (2.3%) of which have been investigated for more than a year; only one (0.5%) is a new site. Three foreign teams (1.4%) investigated sites in northern Bulgarian, and three (1.4%) investi- gated in southern Bulgaria. Excavations in 2006 were conducted throughout the country (fig. 5). The chronological distribution of ar- chaeological sites in northern Bulgaria (71 sites, 32.6% of the total) is as follows: 1 1 prehistoric (5%) , 2 prehis- toric plus another period (0.9%), 19 ancient (8.7%), 5 ancient plus another period (2.3%), and 34 Medi- eval (15.6%). Their distribution by type is as follows: 2 Paleolithic sites (0.9%), 43 settlements (19.8%), 12 necropoleis (5.5%), 11 cultic sites of various character (5.1 %), and 2 production centers (0.9%) . Some 57 sites (80%) were investigated through regular excavations; 14 sites (20%) were investigated through rescue. Most archaeological work (104 sites, 47.7%) in 2006 took place in southern Bulgaria, with a chronological distribution as follows: 15 prehistoric (6.9%), 10 pre- historic plus another period (4.6%) , 48 ancient (22%) , 14 ancient plus another period (6.4%), 14 Medieval (6.4% ) , and 3 post-Medieval ( 1 .4% ) . Their distribution by type is as follows: 60 settlements (27.6%) , 23 necrop- oleis (10.6%), and 21 cultic sites of various character (9.7%). A total of 49 (47%) were regular excavations, and 55 (53%) were rescue projects. There were 43 (19.7%) archaeological excavations and investigations along the Black Sea coast, with chronological distribution as follows: 6 prehistoric (2.8%), 1 prehistoric plus another period (0.5%), 12 ancient (5.5%), 16 ancient plus another period (7.3%), 7 Medieval (3.2%), and 1 Medieval plus another pe- riod (0.5%) .

Types of investigated sites in Bulgaria in 2006. sites of various character (0.9%). A total of 22 (51%) were regular excavations, and 21 (49%) were rescue projects. In 2006, 20 field surveys of sites of all periods were conducted. Their distribution is as follows: 4 surveys in northern Bulgaria (20%), 13 surveys in southern Bulgaria (65%), and 3 surveys in the Black Sea coast area (15%). The prevalence of south Bulgarian sites is due to the larger number of building projects in the area in connection with the economic change of the country. The number of surveys must be increased in order to create a more complete archaeological map of Bulgaria. The breakdown of the 44 prehistoric sites investi- gated in 2006 is illustrated in figure 6 and table 2. A PALEOLITHIC SITE IN THE KOZARNIKA CAVE, BELOGRADCHIK REGION Nikolay Sirakov, NIAM-BAS, and Jean-Luc Guadelli, CNRS, Bordeaux, report: The Kozarnika cave, in northwest Bulgaria near the Danubian plain, is about 3 km from the village of Oreshets (Belogradchik region) and about 30 km from the border with the Republic of Serbia. The cave was discovered in 1933 by Popov,9 but the first systematic excavations began in 1996. Current investigations are being conducted by a Bulgarian-French team (fig. 7) .10 In 2006, excavation focused on the Kozarnika cave, which is also being investigated by the Laboratoire International Associe, the Balkanite I Natchaloto na Evropeiskata Kultura (The Balkans and the Beginning of European Culture) (BINEK-CNRS-BAS) , which was created in January 2006. We continued the analysis of the flintstone industry of the Late Paleolithic period; the radiocarbon data show that the lamellar ensembles a pieces a dos are very early: 37,170 to 39,310 b.p. in cultural level VII. These industries, which continued until ca. 1 1 ,000 b.p., should be distinguished from the classical Gravettian point industry in western Europe and have therefore been called Kozarnikien - a local tradition involved in the emergence of the Gravettian technocomplex sensu lato. The initial Upper Paleolithic is dated from 42,700 to 43,600 b.p. but has not yet been associated with a specific industry. The Early Paleolithic investiga- tions focused on layers 1 lb, lie, and 12, which include ensembles of non-Acheulian character, consisting of fragments, and no bifaces. Nevertheless, according to 9IlonoBl933. 10 On the investigation results, see Guadelli etal. 1999; Gua- delli 2004; Guadelli and Guadelli 2004; Guadelli et al. 2005; Sirakov et al.

The data from the paleontological and archaeozoological investigations11 show forms in the lower part of the Early Paleolithic sequence that attribute the archaeological level to the Early Pleistocene: biozone 18, or even 17, according to Guerin (i.e., ca. 1.4-1.6 ma, or 1.6-1.8 ma according to the position of the biozone borders) . Generally, bone artifacts characterize the entire sequence. The initial data from the paleomagnetic analysis of layer 11 show that at a depth of 0.64 m in relation to the main point of reference, it is likely to enter magnetic instability marking entry into negative phase Brunhes. AMPHITHEATRUM SERDICENSE Zharin Velichkov, National Institute for the Monu- ments of Culture, Sofia, reports: In 2006, in connection with new construction in downtown Sofia, we continued the rescue investiga- tion of the western part of the cavea and the arena of the amphitheater of Serdica and recorded the fol- lowing structures. Roman Theater During investigation of the amphitheatral arena, we found five radial walls belonging to an earlier build- ing, probably a Roman theater. Each is about 2.30 m long and 0.55 m thick and is made of standard Roman bricks joined with white mortar. All radial walls touch a semicircular wall built in the same way, forming a space that was probably part of the theatral orchestra. This space is covered with closely arranged river stones that form a foundation for a floor. North of the ra- dial walls is a complex of two structures joined to the semicircle of the orchestra. The long axis of the first is oriented east-west, the axis of the second (situated west of the first) is oriented north-south. Both struc- tures were destroyed from the north during the later construction of the amphitheatral arena. They were probably architectural elements of the scaenae, pro- scenia, and parascenia discovered within the amphi- theatral arena. Their investigation is forthcoming. The numismatic material shows that this Roman theater was most likely destroyed during the Gothic invasion of the third quarter of the third century C.E. Its construction date needs to be further clarified, but it probably occurred around the end of the second or beginning of the third century. The Late Antique Amphitheater In 2006, we uncovered the arena within the construc- tion area (fig. 8) and cleared the banquette of bricks defining its level. We also exposed the west entrance (vomitorium) of the Late Antique amphitheater. It has six large stone slabs (discovered so far) continuing to the west and cavities in the corners for the wood- en posts of a two-wing door. A drain built from the middle of the entrance runs diagonally through the arena, taking precipitation water eastward to the east vomitorium, where we found - in 2004 - a preserved part of the drain in the wall of the arena. The walls of the drain are of stones joined with white mortar, and its floor is brick. North of the west entrance, we investigated three orthostates with grooves for gates, 11 Conducted by Philippe Fernandez, Jean-Luc Guadelli, Jean-Bap tiste Mallye, Margarita Marinska, Viviana Miteva, and Vasil Popov.</page><page sequence="6">148 IVO D.

North of this wall is a newly discovered entrance leading to the arena. Its threshold is a large stone block with beds for stone jambs visible on each side. In the southern part of the investigated area, we uncovered a relatively well-preserved part of the ca- vea construction. The double semicircular wall was preserved to a considerable height. It was built in opus mixtum, has two separate but touching walls with a thickness of 2.20 m, and marks both construction pe- riods of the amphitheater recorded in 2004. The wall of the arena and the semicircular wall are connected through three radial walls forming sectors (cunei). Two of them are preserved up to the lowest blocks of the arches. They were built in opus mixtum and slant toward the arena. About 3 m from the inner face of the double semicircular wall, there are entrances in both radial walls connecting the three areas. The vaults of the arches were constructed as quarter-circles, while their southern parts were constructed vertically. Per- haps this arrangement acts as a specific counterforce. The separate cunei were covered with cone-shaped arches, and the triangles that resulted between the arches were filled with river stones joined with white mortar. The seats were positioned on top of this even incline. About 18 of them had fallen into the arena. Large pieces of the collapsed arches revealed that their inner surfaces were stuccoed with mortar. We continued the investigation that began in 2005 within the two cunei at seven Late Antique residential levels that were marked with brick covers and floor stucco. The presence of flat pieces of bone, combs, partially worked bone pieces, and (unworked) cut deer horns suggests a workshop. A third cuneusvtas also dis- covered. It reached from the cavea to the floor level and has two entrances: one to the arena, the other to the vomitorium. The threshold of the arena entrance was a stone block. The stone block of its northern jamb was preserved in situ. The coins discovered in 2006 confirm the already established date of the construction and the first phase of the amphitheater (ca. 313-322 C.E.). Numismatic material also reveals that the amphitheater ceased to</page><page sequence="8">150 IVO D. CHOLAKOV AND KRASTYU CHUKALEV [AJA 112 Table 2.

KALETO, MEZDRA REGION Sergey Torbatov, NIAM-BAS, reports: The multilayer site Kaleto occupies a rocky hill on the left bank of the Iskar River, southwest of the town of Mezdra in northwest Bulgaria. Large-scale road construction at the end of the 19th and during the 20th century changed the configuration of the terrain considerably from the north and east. Today, the area of the site is about 2,000 m2 (fig. 10). Archaeologi- cal excavations took place between 1974 and 1990. Their results demonstrate that the habitation of the area began during the Chalcolithic period and con- tinued, with some interruptions, until the end of the 14th century C.E. In 2003, excavations at Kaleto resumed. Investiga- tions during the last few field seasons have provided important evidence about the character and chronol- ogy of its structures. It is now possible to establish the following interpretation of its archaeological remains and rich finds. At the end of the fifth millennium B.C.E., the Late Chalcolithic settlement belonging to the cultural com- plex Krivodol-Salcuta-Bubanj came to an end. Around the middle of the second century C.E., a Roman fort was built to control and protect the road system in the region in a hitherto uninhabited area on top of the hill. Perhaps this was one of the praesi- dia for intraprovincial security built during the reign of the emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161 C.E.). The fort stopped functioning at the end of the second or beginning of the third century C.E. as a result of the invasion of the Costobocs and their allies in 170 C.E. or the Gothic invasion in 180-190 C.E.

At the beginning of the third century C.E., in the territory of the former fort, we have evidence for construction and repair activity. During the reign of Alexander Severus (222-235 C.E.), a pagan religious center was active here. No architectural remains of the first phase of the sanctuary's existence have been found. Connected with this phase, however, are cul- tic foci positioned at different levels and small ritual platforms made of packed, unfired clay (primitive es- charas) on which sacrifices took place. The second phase of the sanctuary's activity belongs to the last third of the third century C.E. It is char- acterized by the construction of a cell-like structure of joined walls consisting of quarried stones held to- gether with mud. The nature of the rituals after this reconstruction remained unchanged. The purpose of the construction may have been to create separate sacrificial areas. The latest coin connected with the functioning of the sanctuary belongs to the reign of Diocletian (284-305 C.E.). At the beginning of the fourth century C.E., a Late Roman fortified settlement was built on top of the ruins of the abandoned pagan sanctuary. During the second half of the fourth century C.E., perhaps as a result of compression of the earth lay- ers or an earthquake, part of the later additions to the northern fortification wall in the central sector collapsed. A partial reconstruction of this area com- menced, including two newly built structures, at the end of the fourth or beginning of the fifth century C.E. During the first half of the fifth century C.E., the fortified settlement was the victim of a massive earth- quake and a devastating hostile invasion. The destruc- tion of the fortification structures interrupted life here until renovation again began at the end of the fifth or first half of the sixth century C.E. in two distinct construction phases. The first phase saw work on the fortification structures, the second phase was a com- plete rebuilding of the fortified territory according to an entirely new urban plan. In the sector investigated in 2006, another construc- tion period was recorded that also belongs to the Early Byzantine period and is dated generally to the second half of the sixth century C.E. Toward the end of the sixth century C.E., the Early Byzantine fortified settle-</page><page sequence="10">152 IVO D. CHOLAKOV AND KRASTYU CHUKALEV [AJA 112 Fig. 9. The amphitheater in Sofia, view from the northwest (Z. Velichkov). merit on Kaleto Hill was destroyed during an invasion by Avars or Slavs. The last habitation period of this site belongs to the Bulgarian Early Medieval period. At the end of the ninth or the beginning of the 10th century C.E., a Bulgarian settlement emerged on top of the ruins of the Early Byzantine fortified settlement; it existed until the Pecheneg invasion during the first half of the 11th century C.E. TELL YUNATSITE Yavor Boyadzhiev, NIAM-BAS, reports: The tell is located in the northwest part of the Thra- cian Valley, 8 km from the town of Pazardjik. It is 12 m high with a maximum diameter of 110 m at the base. The first investigations of the tell were conducted in 1939 by Vassil Mikov through sondages in its eastern part.12 Between 1976 and 1982, systematic excavations in the eastern part of the tell were conducted jointly by the National Institute of Archaeology and Museum of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (NAIM-BAS) and the Regional Museum of History in Pazardjik, under Roumen Katincharov and Velicka Mazanova.13 From 1982 to 1997, projects were carried out by an interna- tional team of scholars from the Institute of Archaeolo- gy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, under Nicolai Merpert.14 At the end of this period, the inves- tigation of the Early Bronze Age layer was completed, and work began on the Chalcolithic cultural layers. After a temporary interruption, excavations resumed in 2001, again by an international team: NIAM-BAS; the Center for Greek and Roman Antiquity-National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece (CGRA- NHRF) ; and the Regional Museum of History in Paz- ardjik, under Yavor Boyadzhiev, Ioanis Aslanis, and Stoilka Terzijska-Ignatova. The investigation in the eastern part of the tell oc- cupies an area up to 1275 m2. Since 2002, we have con- 12 On the first investigations, see Mhkob 1940. 16 On the investigation results between 1976 and 1982, see Mazanova 1992, 1996; KaTHHHapoB and MaijaHOBa 1993. 14 On the investigation results between 1982 and 1997, see KaTHHHapoB et al. 1995; Merpert 1995; Garasanin 1996; MnuiMHa 1998; EaAa6nHa etal. 2002.</page><page sequence="11">2008] ARCHAEOLOGY IN BULGARIA, 2006 SEASON 153 Fig. 10.

Torbatov). ducted a sondage at the periphery in the western part of the tell; it has a width of 10 m and a maximum length of 10 m at its base (fig. 11). The investigations show the following stratigraphy: a necropolis of the 13th to 14th century C.E., a Roman settlement (second-fourth century C.E.), settlements belonging to various phases of the Iron Age (lOth-third century B.C.E.) , an Early Bronze Age layer containing 17 horizons with an average thickness of 5.20 m (third millennium B.C.E.) , and a Chalcolithic layer (fifth mil- lennium B.C.E.) . The last Chalcolithic horizon was destroyed during a hostile invasion. Within the burnt residences, we found skeletons of the slaughtered inhabitants and 10 shal- low burials in the spaces between the homes. Upon completion in 2006, the investigation of this horizon in the southeast area of the tell established that the occupation lasted for a long time, with multiple reno- vations of the floor levels and reconstruction of the residences and their installations. We found two buri- als in the fetal (hocker) position in the periphery. In the sondage in the western area, two Early Bronze Age II (2700-2400 b.p.) horizons were investigated. Next to the periphery, we discovered a trench with sunken wooden posts (with a depth up to 0.60 m) , rep- resenting part of the defense wall of the settlement. Opening trenches in the area around the tell with the aim of discovering the Chalcolithic necropolis situ- ated about 200 m to the northwest (southwest of the mound) , we discovered a cultural Chalcolithic layer un- der a sterile layer, 1.00-1.50 m thick. This layer shows that the settlement extended over a considerable area outside the boundaries of the tell. NECROPOLIS AND RITUAL STRUCTURES NEAR DUBENE, KARLOVO REGION Martin Hristov, National Museum of History, So- fia, reports: The investigated ritual structures and necropolis are situated 2 km southeast of the village of Dubene, in the Karlovo region of central Bulgaria. They are di- rectly associated with the Early Bronze Age settlement (3500/3200-2100 B.C.E.) about 400 m away.15 From 2004 to 2006, seven structures belonging to the necropolis were investigated. Six of them are low and flat. Their stone coverings reach thicknesses up to 40 cm and a maximum diameter of 14.5 m (fig. 12). In their center lie ceramic vessels, small bone frag- ments, and multiple gold ornaments (&gt; 20,000) . The gold objects are spirals, convex appliques, biconic and pyramidal beads, and miniature elements (string beads, their separators, and adzelike objects). Other ritual structures yielded a bronze knife, a whetstone, a gold poniard, a silver dagger, and glass beads. The vessels discovered include jugs, bowls, cups of the Yu- natsite type, as well as a small vessel whose shape ex- hibits local and Anatolian features. Based on the finds, the low structures are dated to Early Bronze Age III 15 On the investigation results, see XpticroB 2005; Hristov 2006.</page><page sequence="12">154 IVO D.

Analysis showed the bone is faunal, suggesting the presence of ritual structures in which artifacts and animal bones were deposited and covered with medium-sized river stones. In one of the large mounds, we discovered two in- humation graves, along with 13 gold objects and sev- eral ceramic vessels also dated to Early Bronze Age III. The presence of certain types of Early Bronze Age gold objects in Thrace is probably due to influences from or direct trade contacts with Asia Minor in the southeast and the northern Aegean in the south. These contacts continue to the north and, particularly, the northwest. In this way, the central Balkans served as a link between Asia Minor and Europe during the Early Bronze Age. Given the number and typology of the gold objects, it is likely that they were produced in the vicinity of the ritual structures and necropolis. A THRACIAN TUMULAR NECROPOLIS IN DEVIN, SMOLIAN REGION Borislav Borislavov, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski," reports: In the summer of 2006, we began regular excavations of four mounds of a large tumular necropolis in the region of Lilovo, 13 km northwest of the town of Devin, in the Western Rhodope Mountains. The mounds are situated along the ridges of modest-sized outcroppings at an altitude of 1,330-1,400 masl. The necropolis de- veloped around a sanctuary on top of a clearly marked, conical hill and a Late Roman settlement. Tumulus 1 measures 17 x 16 m; a Late Roman cist necropolis developed as an extension of the southern slope of the tumular mound. We investigated four Late Bronze Age cremation burials in situ, the remains of which were deposited in clay urns. Clay loomweights were found among the bones. The grave gifts includ- ed one jug and one kantharoslike cup per grave. The surfaces of the vessels were polished with graphite, and some were decorated with a rich, incised solar ornamentation executed in white paste. Grave 4 is probably the earliest burial in the mound and is lo- cated in its western half. It has a trapezoid shape (3.35 x 2.00 m), and a channel (lgth. 2.20 m) runs along its northern side toward the east. It was dug into the bedrock and is circumscribed with a groove and four large postholes. It is possible that before cremation, the body was displayed under a wooden shed for last respects. Within the grave, we found a bronze rapier, a bronze hilt end, and 10 clay vessels. About 2 m to the northwest, we investigated a pyre that contained the remains of burnt human bones, seven gold orna- ment melts, fragments of burnt bronze objects, and a burnt clay loomweight. The rapier is the first of its kind discovered during regular excavations. It resembles Mycenaean rapiers of type A (according to Georg Karo), described as "Transylvanian rapiers."16 This find is a vital piece of ev- idence for early Thracian and Mycenaean contacts, as well as an important object for dating purposes from a closed complex within the almost unknown first phase of the Late Bronze Age in Thrace (fig. 13). 16Bouzekl985,34,fig.7.</page><page sequence="13">2008] ARCHAEOLOGY IN BULGARIA, 2006 SEASON 155 Fig. 12. Stone covering of Ritual Structure 4, near the village of Dubene, view from the west (M. Hristov). Mound 1 was reused during the Late Roman pe- riod. We investigated 70 cist graves with cremation. The coins, clay vessels, and ornaments found in the graves date them to the end of the third through the end of the fourth century C.E. Mound 2 measures 8.80 x 9.60 m and is 1 m in height. Two iron spear points, two iron double-spiral fibulas, a small iron knife, and three vessels were found around the monolithic stone block, which is shaped like an isosceles triangle. The mound dates from the beginning of the Early Iron Age to the 10th century B.C.E. and can be interpreted as a cenotaph. Mound 8 has a stone crepis measuring 10 m in diame- ter; it contained 16 graves. The central grave dates from the second/first century B.C.E.; 15 date from the end of the fourth/beginning of the fifth century C.E. The 2006 investigations show that the tumular ne- cropolis was used in the Late Bronze Age (16th-15th century B.C.E.) , the Early Iron Age (10th century B.C.E.) , and antiquity (second-first century B.C.E./ third-beginning of fifth century C.E.) . The finds from this site evidence active contacts with the Aegean coast and Macedonia. TELL HOTNITSA, VELIKO TARNOVO Alexander Chohadzhiev, Regional Museum of His- tory, Veliko Tarnovo, reports: Tell Hotnitsa is situated on the left bank of the Bo- hot River, about 300 m northeast of the village of Hot- nitsa and about 20 km northwest of Veliko Tarnovo. It is more than 5 m high with a diameter of 1 10 m at its base. A large number of archaeological sites of various periods have been discovered in this region.17 The first investigations of the tell were conducted from 1956 to 1959, under Nikola Angelov of the Re- gional Historical Museum, Veliko Tarnovo, when 20 residences of the uppermost horizon of the mound were studied.18 A stratigraphical sondage was con- ducted in the southern part of the mound, in which 14 construction horizons were recorded. According to Todorova, the earliest horizons belong to phases II and III of the Early Chalcolithic Polianica culture. Layers of the Middle and Late Chalcolithic were recorded: Polianica IV and Kodzadermen-Gumelnita-Karanovo VI.19 During the excavations conducted by Angelov, the so-called Hotnitsa gold treasure was discovered,20 as were a large number of artifacts. 17 On sites recorded in the Hotnitsa region, see HAMeBa 2000, 2002. 18 On the investigation results between 1956 and 1959, see AHreAOB 1958, 1961. 19To4opoBal986,78. 20 On the Hotnitsa gold treasure, see AHreAOB 1959.</page><page sequence="14">156 IVO D. CHOLAKOV AND KRASTYU CHUKALEV [AJA 112 Fig. 13. Late Bronze Age rapier, discovered in the tumular necropolis near Devin (drawing by B. Borislavov). In 2000, after an interruption of about 40 years, the excavations of Tell Hotnitsa were resumed under Stefan Chohadzhiev of the University of Veliko Tar- novo "St. Cyril and St. Methodius." The excavations are concentrated in the northern half of the mound; residences of the second and third construction ho- rizons are currently being investigated.21 By 2006, we had investigated 10 residences and parts of residences, as well as part of the fortification system (the remains of a wooden palisade strengthened with stones) of the settlement in the southern area of the mound. From 2000 to 2001, four gold objects were found that do not belong to the so-called gold treasure. In 2006, the regular excavations at Tell Hotnitsa continued. Parts of three neighboring residences were discovered with two "small streets" between them. The small streets form a T-shaped junction. Their widths are 0.50-0.60 m and 1.00-1.20 m (fig. 14). Clusters of fragmentary ceramic vessels, stones, bones, and burnt wood were also investigated. It was established that they belong to a residential structure. This was confirmed also by the presence of remains of boards and beams from a floor as well as ceiling rem- nants. We also discovered remains of wooden posts and interwoven sticks of a fence among the fragmen- tary ceramic vessels and bones. There were no traces of violent destruction. Of special interest among the finds discovered last season are a flat anthropomorphic figurine cut out of an ordinary river mussel and the lower half of a marble anthropomorphic figurine. A hole was dug in the area of the hips of the latter, but in the marble surface, there was no trace of use for hanging. The closest sources of marble similar to the type used for this figurine are along the Aegean coast and islands. Other finds include a marble button and three ceramic representations of grain kernels. Two of the kernels were found among carbonized grain in a burnt resi- dence that was probably used in rituals associated with crops. An informative and valuable find is a gold spiral discovered last season. Unlike other hitherto discov- ered spirals, it was probably fashioned not by means of pulling but by the beating of gold wire. The gold in the spiral is 22.9 karat, and the ratio of gold to silver (95.42:3.21) suggests that the natural gold was refined. This new gold spiral is the earliest example discovered of mining and reworking of gold and is of great im- portance for the relative chronology of the gold ob- jects found so far. Its stratigraphical position certainly points to earlier stages of the Late Chalcolithic in the region, and its rough fashioning and relatively heavy weight confirm this possibility. One of the most significant finds in 2006, and the first object of this sort from Tell Hotnitsa, is a fragment of a ceramic bowl with an incised group of symbols re- sembling the letters "IYI." The incisions were scratched onto the polished surface after the vessel was fired. NOVAE: ROMAN MILITARY CAMP AND EARLY BYZANTINE CITY Evgenia Gencheva, NIAM-BAS, reports: The excavations of the Roman military camp of No- vae have been conducted since 1959 by a Bulgarian- Polish expedition.22 The camp is located 4 km east of the town of Svishtov, on the bank of the Danube. It was founded by Legio VIII Augusta in 45 C.E. The first camp, which existed between 45 and 69 C.E., was made of wood and earth, and had a vallum made of blocks of unfired clay and strengthened in places with wooden logs. Wooden rectangular inner towers belonged to 21 On the newinvestigations at Tell Hotnitsa, see Hoxa/pKHeB and Eachckh 2002; Chokhadzhiev and Chokhadzhiev 2005. 22 On the Roman military camp at Novae, see Warsaw Uni- versity 1990-2007; Parnicki-Pudelko 1990; Kolendo and Bozilova 1997; KAeHima 2006.</page><page sequence="15">2008] ARCHAEOLOGY IN BULGARIA, 2006 SEASON 157 Fig. 14. Plan of residences in Tell Hotnitsa (drawing by A. Chohadzhiev) . this camp. The buildings in the interior were made of interwoven wooden rods stuccoed with clay.23 In 69 C.E., Legio I Italica arrived here, and Novae became its base until the second quarter of the fifth century C.E., when the construction of solid stone walls began. The rectangular area of the camp is surrounded by massive fortification walls that measure 1.5-3.0 m thick. The walls have inner rectangular towers measur- ing 6.0 x 4.5 m. Each gate is flanked by two rectangu- lar towers partially protruding in front of the curtain wall. In 2006, we continued the investigations of the northeast corner of the fort and part of the northern fortification wall. The fortification system existed in this shape almost until the late third century C.E., when the fortified area was rebuilt and enlarged. The addition to the east was protected by a new semicircular wall with exterior rectangular towers. At the beginning of the fourth century C.E., the old inner towers along the western and southern walls were replaced with exterior U-shaped towers. The western gate was then rebuilt with large rectangular towers entirely protruding in front of the wall. In this shape, the fortification system faced the barbarian invasions of the second half of the fourth through the fifth century C.E. After each invasion, the fortification walls were rebuilt, with the last construc- tion dating to Justinian I (527-565 C.E.) (fig. 15). The camp was planned according to Roman military criteria. So far, we have investigated the headquarters {principia) of the legion, located in the center at the junction of the two main streets. The plan of the head- quarters is rectangular, measuring 105 x 53 m. The administration facilities were in the southern part, and the sanctuary of the flags was in the center. The two treasuries and the secretarial offices were positioned symmetrically in relation to them. Last year, we in- vestigated the principia from the time of Nero (54-68 C.E.), located under the later one. Opposite the headquarters, on the other side of the via principalis, are the residences of the military tribunes. We have investigated most of a large urban 23IeHHeBa2002.</page><page sequence="16">158 IVO D. CHOLAKOV AND KRASTYU CHUKALEV [AJA 112 Fig. 15. Plan of the Roman military camp of Novae (drawing by E. Gencheva). villa consisting of a number of structures grouped around a central court. North of the tribunes' residences, the only com- pletely preserved military hospital (valetudinarium) in Europe was discovered. It is square and consists of rows of premises divided by a corridor on each side. An inner courtyard with a sanctuary of Asklepios and Hygieia lies in the center. The hospital was built at the very end of the first century in connection with the Da- cian Wars of Trajan (98-117 C.E.). In 2006, investiga- tions continued in the legionary baths, which date to the Flavian dynasty and which are located under the military hospital. The legionary baths, which served the camp from the second to the fourth century C.E., lie west of the headquarters. Later, a bishopric complex was con- structed on top of them. The complex consists of basilicas and the bishop's residence. On its southern side, we discovered several buildings making up the ptochotrophium, which was intended for preparation of food for pilgrims and the poor. The construction of the complex began in the second quarter of the fifth century C.E., after the headquarters of the legion left and the camp became a civil settlement.24 It existed until the beginning of the seventh century C.E., when it was destroyed by Avars and Slavs. AN ANCIENT PRODUCTION CENTER NEAR THE VILLAGE OF KRIVINA, RUSE REGION Lyudmil F. Vagalinski, NIAM-BAS, reports: The site is situated about 1 km from the present- day Danubian bank, and has been excavated for three years (2002, 2005, and 2006) ,25 In 2006, we investigated five new Roman lime kilns, and now have a total of seven completely studied kilns and three whose investigation has started. Their density 24Parnicki-Pudelko 1995. 25 Vagalinski (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="17">2008] ARCHAEOLOGY IN BULGARIA, 2006 SEASON 159 and the results of their paleomagnetic analysis presup- pose a much greater number. The kilns, which are dug into the loess (fig. 16), are well preserved, relatively large in size, and diverse in shape: pear-shaped and el- liptical horizontally, and barrel-shaped or frustum of a cone vertically. Their hitherto suggested date was con- firmed (the last third of the first century) . The second brickstamp, as well as some new fragments of a Roman helmet of the Weisenau type, support the hypothesis that this large-scale lime production center belonged to Legio I Italica. We investigated a Thracian cremation burial dated to between the third and first centuries B.C.E. Based on human bone fragments found around the lime kilns, it may have been part of a local Hellenistic (prob- ably Late Hellenistic) necropolis that was destroyed by Roman construction work. A bread furnace contem- porary with the investigated pre-Roman pottery kiln of Celtic construction was also found; it dates from the first century B.C.E. /first century C.E. We investigated an Early Medieval child's burial. It confirms the suggestion that a small Bulgarian settle- ment existed in the area during the eighth to 10th centuries C.E. The archaeozoological investigation shows that the Roman soldiers ate a variety of meat: pork, sheep, fish, and beef (pork and sheep being the most numerous) . Paleobotanical results confirm that oak was the main fuel for the lime kilns. Specimens were collected for archaeomagnetic analysis. DANA BUNAR 2 Vassil Nikolov, NIAM-BAS, reports: In 2006, we continued rescue excavations at the Neolithic sanctuary of Dana Bunar 2, near the town of Lyubimets. The site (675 m2) has an uneven sterile foundation with denivellation running north-south. A layer of gray, ashy earth associated with the Karanovo III-IV culture lies on top of it. This layer has a maxi- mum investigated length of 35 m, a width of up to 15 m, and an average thickness of 0.60-0.80 m. Nine pits with diameters of 0.70-1.40 m were inves- tigated in the lower part of the layer. Their features - plastering of the walls and floors, presence of ash and charcoal, whole or broken vessels, and fragments of anthropomorphic figures - and their location sug- gest a cultic pit complex of the Karanovo III-IV culture (5500-5400 B.C.E.). A central pit discovered in the middle of the inves- tigated area is circular with a diameter of 4.60 m in its upper part. It was dug into the sterile foundation to a maximum depth of 0.50 m. Ceramic fragments, ani- mal bones, numerous flintstone artifacts, a cultic table, a bone awl, a pestle, and fragments of two millstones Fig. 16. A Roman lime kiln near the Danube village of Kriv- ina, northern Bulgaria (L.F. Vagalinski) . were found. Holes (diam. 0.20-0.44 m) dug to various depths have been found in the center and along the periphery of the pit. Nine pits, the walls of which display no traces of plas- tering, belong to the same period. Whole or broken ceramic vessels, numerous animal bones, bone awls, flintstone artifacts, millstones, and stone pestles were found in them. Clusters of broken or whole vessels were also discovered at various places outside the pits. A level of scattered small and large pieces of plaster was recorded in the upper part of the gray, ashy layer with imprints of posts and sticks in it. The level is 15 m long and 5 m wide and also follows the north-south denivellation. The most characteristic finds belonging to the Karanovo III-IV period are the bowls with bent mouths, the vertical-handled jugs with flat protrusions, and the enormous amount of flintstone artifacts. Above the Karanovo III-IV cultural layer is a thick brown layer with plaster and ashes (thickness 0.25-0.45 m) belonging to the Karanovo IV (5400-5200 B.C.E.) culture. We also investigated part of a building that continues south. A hearth was found inside, but there was no floor. Three more kilns and two hearths were investigated in this Karanovo IV layer; small pieces of malachite (lgth. 3-4 mm) were found in the destroyed</page><page sequence="18">160 IVO D. CHOLAKOV AND KRASTYU CHUKALEV [AJA 112 foundation of one of the kilns. A fragmented human skull was unearthed in the middle part of the investi- gated area, but no pit was registered. Fifteen pits with ceramic fragments, animal bones, bone tools and pestles, quartz balls, flintstone artifacts, millstones, whetstones, a ceramic adze, and small, round ceramic pieces were present in this layer. A characteristic feature of the ceramic complex of this layer is its rich, white- encrusted decoration and white-paint ornamentation. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures were found - bone and stone tools were rarely recovered - as was an enormous quantity of flintstone artifacts (fig. 17). Above the Karanovo IV layer lies an arable layer with an average thickness of 0.25-0.30 m and containing mixed finds from Karanovo III-IV, Karanovo IV, and antiquity. Some of the investigated pits at the site are also from the ancient period. GREAT PRESLAV Margarita Vaklinova, NIAM-BAS, reports: About 2 km from the present-day town of Preslav, in northeast Bulgaria, are the remains of Great Preslav, capital of the medieval Bulgarian kingdom between 893 and 971 C.E. The town has an area of 3.5 km2. There is a walled inner city containing the royal resi- dential complex (fig. 18). The palatial center of Great Preslav includes the most representative buildings forming the seat of pow- er and is situated in fenced complexes around court- yards and squares.26 During the last five seasons, we investigated several monumental buildings east of the Throne Palace that were constructed of large worked limestone blocks. They are situated around a square and are covered with stone blocks and slabs. Most re- markable among them are the remains of a basilica (lgth. 47.5 m x wdth. 21.0 m) with a tripartite nave and three apses.27 It is 30 m from the northeast cor- ner of the Throne Palace and has a rich decoration of floor mosaics in opus sectile with variegated patterns in white, green, and red, as well as marble architectonic details in relief. The remains of an ambo are preserved in the central part of the nave. The basilica was used between the ninth and 11th centuries, after which it underwent serious reconstruction. A large necropolis developed in the surrounding area during the 12th and 13th centuries. The excavations in 2005 and 2006 revealed an en- tire building with a width of 10.4 m. It provides a di- rect connection, perhaps at an upper level, between the supposed throne room and the southwest part of the exonarthex. The building fences off access to the central square from the north, where its facade was probably constructed with an arcade resting on pil- lars. It belongs to the last stage in the construction of the palatial center in the second quarter of the 10th century. Between this building and the facade of the Throne Palace runs a passage with a north entrance through which one could reach the square along a slanting ramp made of stone blocks. In the area south of the apses of the basilica, we in- vestigated a building with a chainlike plan, closing the square in front of the palaces from the east. Its west fa- cade, which faces the square, has an arcade resting on massive pillars. The uncovered parts of its ground level show that it was overarched. We investigated a 20 m area of the building to the south and defined its width of 12.2 m. We also uncovered a continuation of the building to the south. Perhaps it fenced off the square entirely from the east, with a covered passageway run- ning through it to the square. The two buildings inve- tigated during the last season have a well-constructed water supply system. The newly discovered buildings were destroyed around the last quarter of the 10th century, after which the terrain around the main buildings was used for production activity and construction of small residen- tial buildings and installations. This explains the large number of refuse pits. We discovered kilns for house- hold pottery and ironworking. The large number of tools, household items, and weapons suggests a high level of urban culture. This entire area in the center, as well as the building remains, were used intensively until the 1080s and from the end of the 12th century to the 1270s (fig. 19). The discovery of this site is crucial for understand- ing the chronology and the stratigraphy of the second Bulgarian capital. It shows us the level of quotidian and industrial culture of the population that used this ter- rain during different periods, the character of urban construction, and the type of palatial con true tion in general in medieval Bulgaria. THE GETIC CAPITAL IN SBORYANOVO Totko Stoyanov, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohrid- ski," reports: The large fortified Thracian settlement in the heart of the Sboryanovo national preserve is situated north- west of the town of Isperih, in northeast Bulgaria. Its investigations began in 1986, under the direction of Maria Chichikova; since 1990, Totko Stoyanov has been 26 On the palatial buildings in Great Preslav, see BaKAHHOBa 1994; BaKAHHOBa and HfepeBa 1995. 27 On the Ruler's Church in Great Preslav, see BaKAHHOBa etal.2003.</page><page sequence="19">2008] ARCHAEOLOGY IN BULGARIA, 2006 SEASON 161 Fig. 17.

The data accumulated for 20 archaeological seasons allow us to define the basic characteristics of the city, founded as Helis, the capital of the Getae.28 Other remarkable sites that have been investigated at Sboryanovo include monumental tumuli and graves contemporary with the Getic capital, the sanctuary un- der Demir Baba Teke, a prehistoric tell, an Early Iron Age site at Kamen Rid, and an Early Medieval settle- ment at Petrova Niva. The investigations in this region were stimulated by the discovery of the famous Tomb of Sveshtari (the caryatid tomb) in 1982, under the Ginina Mogila mound in the village of Sveshtari. On a plateau surrounded on three sides by the Krapinec River, a massive fortification system was built to defend an area of more than 100,000 m2 (fig. 20). The main fortification wall was about 3.6 m wide and about 1,400 m in length. It has outer and inner faces, constructed with rows of large, roughly worked blocks of local limestone with a fill of variously sized stones joined by well-mixed clay. The walls are preserved to varying heights (0.40-2.20 m). The construction, the width, and the fallen remains allow us to reconstruct the height of the wall to at least 7.00-7.20 m, and up to 9 m with the parapet. The two main gates of the city - the south and the north - were registered. A tower and a postern were discovered east of the south gate. There must have been other gates and fortifica- tion installations. Later, after the construction of the main fortification wall, two diateichismatawith separate Fig. 18. Great Preslav, aerial view, showing the palatial center with the palaces, basilica, and two buildings (P.

Lead ampule from Great Preslav depicting St. De- metrius on one side and Virgin Mary as the intercessor on the other (P. Dimitrov) . entrances were attached to its eastern part. In 2002, northwest of the north gate, we discovered Diateich- isma 3. The investigations from the last few years reveal the existence of residential quarters, also outside the fortified area to the west and northwest, on terraces in front of the south wall. In 1996, we discovered the inner fortification wall, which occupies more than 50,000 m2 and is of vary- ing construction. The fortified area of the plateau was densely constructed with buildings and installations of residential, economical, and other types. Stratigraphical analysis dates the two main stages in the development of the city, with relative precision, to the last quarter of the fourth century B.C.E. and the first half of the third century B.C.E. Especially impor- tant for dating are the amphora stamps, the numis- matic chronology, the imported pottery, and some metal finds, all of which allow us to date the emer- gence of the city to the beginning of the last quarter of the fourth century B.C.E. Its end can be placed ca. 250 B.C.E., defined by a clearly recorded earthquake that brought about the destruction of the city. It was not rebuilt after that. The evidence from the western quarter, investigated during the last two seasons, combined with observa- tions in the sanctuary at Demir Baba Teke, allow the hypothesis that from the end of the third/beginning of the second century B.C.E. to the first half of the first century B.C.E., life resumed in much more mod- est dimensions in this part of the Getic city. MEDIEVAL DRASTAR Rumiana Koleva, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski," reports: The remains of medieval Drastar are situated under the modern town of Silistra, in northeast Bulgaria. During the first millennium B.C.E., a Thracian set- tlement existed here. The convenient and strategic location was the reason for the founding of the an- cient city of Durostorum. After Trajan's Dacian Wars (101-102/105-106 C.E.), Legio XI Claudia settled in Durostorum. The city became one of the major cen- ters along the limes of the lower Danube. In 169 C.E., Durostorum obtained the status of municipium. The Late Roman tomb with well-preserved frescoes that date to the end of the fourth century C.E. reveals the high status of the city residents. After the founding of the Bulgarian state in 681 C.E., Drastar became a major medieval urban center. The archaeological investigations of medieval Drastar began in 1969. They are financed by the mu- nicipality of Silistra and Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski," under StefkaAngelova. Since 1995, archae- ology students at the university have been conducting their summer training at this site. Medieval Drastar emerged on top of an Early Byzan- tine fort that was built in the sixth century C.E. A gate in the eastern part of the north wall, other sections of the walls, and two pentagonal and three triangular towers have been discovered. The fortification wall was repaired during the Early Medieval period - no later than the ninth century C.E. A new gate was built in the east wall. The remains of an impressive building and a nearby bath are from the same period. During the 1997 excavations, we found a column fragment with the name of Khan Omurtag (814-831 C.E.), proving that the "illustrious home on the Danube" - mentioned in the famous inscription on this khan's column from the Church of the 40 Holy Matryrs in Veliko Tarnovo - is the city of Drastar.29 After Christianity was introduced to Bulgaria at the end of the ninth century C.E., an impressive architec- 29 On the investigations of the city, see AHreAOBa 1980; Angelova 1987, 1999; AHreAOBa et al. 2006.</page><page sequence="21">2008] ARCHAEOLOGY IN BULGARIA, 2006 SEASON 163 Fig. 20. Thracian fortified settlement (outlined in black) in the national preserve of Sboryanovo (drawing by T. Stoyanov). tural complex was built in the northwest corner of the fort. Since 1992, a similar complex located east of the first complex has been under investigation. It includes a basilica and a building with a chainlike construction. The church was built at the end of the ninth century and reconstructed during the 10th century, when the Bulgarian patriarch took up residence here. The entire church, or part of it, survived the Pecheneg invasion and continued to function during the 13th and 14th centuries (fig. 21). Residential buildings of ordinary people arose after 970 C.E. in the area around the church. This practice continued during the 13th and 14th centuries. Burials were placed in and around the basilica during its entire existence. The aristocratic tombs of the 14th century C.E. belong to the family of despot Ivanko Terter, who lived in Drastar at the end of the 14th century. The investigations of the past few years have focused on the area west of the basilica; the southern part of the chainlike building and the terrain west of it are now being uncovered. A craftsmen's quarter functioned at this location during the second half of the 13 th century. Kilns for household pottery and waste from ceramic production have been found. In 2006, we continued to uncover Building 3/2005, situated west of the complex. The premises of the chainlike building were also investigated. We discov- ered residential buildings of the 14th century C.E. and a pottery kiln from the second half of 13th century. PLISKA Rasho Rashev, NIAM-BAS, reports: The remains of the medieval town of Pliska are lo- cated under the modern town of the same name in northeast Bulgaria. The settlement was the first capi- tal of the medieval Bulgarian state between 681 and 893 C.E. The archaeological investigations here have a tradition of more than 100 years. The investigations of the past few years have focused on the earliest period of the town's existence: the so- called period of wooden construction. During the 1970s and 1980s, we investigated traces of a wooden construction "in the negative" (through the preserved cavities) under the pavement of the palatial square. The structure had a circular plan and a diameter of 14 m. To the south, we found the remains of a wooden wall that surrounded the early residence of the khans. For the last five archaeological seasons, we have in- vestigated a large part of the area within the surround- ing brick wall, the so-called Citadel.

CHOLAKOV AND KRASTYU CHUKALEV [AJA 112 Fig. 21. Medieval basilica in Drastar, modern Silistra (R. Koleva). remains of another circular wooden construction were discovered. The area of this building (510 m2) is three times more than that of the structure investigated 25 years ago. It was also investigated in the negative. More than 130 pits were preserved, in which round and squarish wooden posts with a thickness up to 0.5 m were sunk. These were arranged in four concentric rows, the outermost with a diameter of 25 m. The two inner rows of posts, which were sunk deeper than the rest, probably supported the main and highest part of the construction. The building developed around a central post with a diameter of 0.8 m, sunk 3.2 m below the surface at that time. North of the construc- tion runs a straight row of posts that seems to have formed a ramp leading to the inhabited level. This level was raised to about 3-4 m above the surrounding area, which is characteristic of both the other circular construction and the later monumental buildings in Pliska(fig. 22). No materials were found in the fill of the pits for the wooden posts or in the floor level, with the exception of two round glass appliques. This, in addition to the stratigraphy, which shows no previous construction, suggests that this building is perhaps the first stationary wooden construction in the palatial center of Pliska. The lack of household pottery can be explained by the building having been constructed on terrain with no deposited cultural layer. In the fill of some pits for wooden posts, we discovered traces of burnt earth. Perhaps these traces are remnants of hearths in the houses of light construction that preceded the more solid wooden residences in the center of Pliska. The investigation revealed the building's connection, albeit indirect, with the Palace of Krum, the earliest stone palatial building in Pliska. The subterranean passage coming out of the palace turns sideways so that it does not interfere with the wooden building. This provides an upper chronological limit, since the two buildings obviously existed simultaneously for some time. The circular wooden building belongs to the earliest fixed constructions in the center of Pliska. It can be interpreted as a palace that existed between the end of seventh and the end of the eighth centuries. TELL KARNOBAT Yavor Boyadzhiev, NIAM-BAS, reports: Tell Karnobat is located near the railway station of the town of Karnobat, in southeast Bulgaria. It has a terraced shape with a height of about 12 m and base diameter of 120 m. In 2006, we began a systematic investigation of the tell. A sondage was placed in the periphery of its highest part, oriented north-south, with a width of 5 m and a length of 15 m. It enabled us to trace the cultural layers to a depth of more than 2.5 m. Five stratigraphical levels were established, all belonging to the Late Chalcolithic. The two lower levels were burnt. Traces of fire can be found in the rest, but the investigated area is too small to allow for definite conclusions. The majority of the finds are flints tone artifacts (n=188), which show a remarkable variety in shape and function. Additional finds include fragmented clay anthropomorphic statuettes; a bone idol; two fragments of cultic tables, each with a schematic de- piction of eyes along the rim; and tools made of stone, bone, and horns.</page><page sequence="23">2008] ARCHAEOLOGY IN BULGARIA, 2006 SEASON 165 Fig. 22. Wooden structure with a circular plan in the palatial center of Pliska (S. Ivanov). The shapes of the vessels are typical of the Late Chal- colithic period: bowls with variously shaped mouths (funnel-like, cylindrical, with a rim bent inward or thickened) , rounded and biconical bowls (some with a clearly defined place of greatest circumference) , vase- like vessels, and pots of different sizes and shapes. The decoration is rich: thin, incised graphite lines; wide margins with white encrustation; incisions along the mouth or the place of greatest circumference; pricks from a nail, mussel, or stamp; relief stripes with small pits; buds; artificially roughened lower parts; and smoothed upper parts. Different types of decoration are frequently combined. The location of the tell (south of the passes in the eastern part of the Balkan Mountain) and the archaeological material show that it played a key role for trade contacts in the upper Thracian Valley in northeast Bulgaria and the south- ern Black Sea coast of Bulgaria. The materials discovered along the slopes of the tell and at its base testify that its habitation began as early as the Neolithic period. With cultural layers of almost 12 m, it is one of the largest Neolithic-Chalcolithic monuments in Europe. Scattered materials from the surface layer suggest that it was also occupied during the Early Bronze Age. TELL PROVADIA-SOLNITSATA Vassil Nikolov, NIAM-BAS, reports: Tell Provadia-Solnitsata has a roughly circular shape with a base diameter of 105 m and a height of 7 m. On top of the tell, a second tumular mound (dram. 68 m, ht. 15 m) began to accumulate, probably during the fourth century B.C.E. The archaeological investiga- tions of the tell recorded six construction levels, which are described here from the lowest upward. Layers 6 and 5 belong to the Karanovo III-IV culture. Parts of two residential buildings were investigated in layer 5. The east wall of the first building was evidenced by 15 postholes with diameters of 0.10-0.20 m. Its floor has a well-smoothed, fire-baked surface. Within the building, an oval silo was found, lightly sunk into the floor. Multiple ceramic vessels, some placed within each other, were found around the silo. Two stone tools, a lower millstone, and a stone pestle were also found in the building. Part of the west wall of the second build- ing (wdth. 0.18 m) was discovered. It has two faces and five postholes between them, with diameters of 0.08- 0.10 m. On the brown, packed-clay floor, we found two small, slightly conical clay posts with a four-sided trans- verse section oriented north-south. We established that they were produced outside the building, after which they were glued with clay to its foundation, before the floor was constructed. They are 0.34 and 0.36 m high, with a distance of about 1 m between them. Between and around the posts, we discovered two vertical- handled jugs, a bowl, fragments of a base, and parts of other ceramic vessels. We found four stone pestles nearby, arranged semicircularly, and a collective find comprising eight loomweights was discovered on the building stucco. On top of the building floor, a square silo was built, with a side of 0.62 m, rounded corners, and lightly convex walls. The number of fragments</page><page sequence="24">166 IVO D. CHOLAKOV AND KRASTYU CHUKALEV [AJA 112 from salt-producing vessels is much greater compared with the mass of ceramic fragments (fig. 23). Layers 4, 3, and 2 belong to the Hamangia IV cul- ture. We investigated two residential buildings in lay- er 4 and discovered part of the south wall of the first building, marked by 14 postholes with diameters of 0.08-0.10 m. A very well-preserved packed-clay floor with a thickness of 0.04-0.05 m was recorded north of the wall. Under the floor was a conical bowl, a ce- ramic cluster, and a lower millstone. The floor stucco (thickness 0.20-0.30 m) is heavily burnt. The second building revealed a grayish-brown, packed-clay floor with a thickness of 0.06-0.07 m and covered with a thin, black layer of burnt plant materials. On top of it was yellow clay, probably from a wall or a ceiling. We investigated a building in layer 2 with a floor of yel- lowish, soft clay in which we found no traces of posts. Twelve fragmented ceramic vessels and fallen pieces of stucco lay in situ on the floor. We also discovered, at various depths between and on top of the stucco, a small stone adze and 13 fragmented ceramic vessels turned sideways or upside down, including a zoomor- phic vessel with a schematic depiction of a bird. South of the building in layer 2, we found a row of palisade posts - sometimes double - oriented southwest-north- east. It contains 23 holes with diameters of 0.15-0.22 m and a distance of 0.20-0.30 m between them. The palisade infringes upon the uppermost Neolithic layer and belongs perhaps to the Chalcolithic layer. At about 4 m southeast (in the outer direction) of the palisade, we discovered part of a ditch with a bottom width of 0.60-0.70 m. The ditch is slightly semicircular and fol- lows the palisade that circumscribes the settlement. Layer 1 is 0.10-0.20 m thick and contained mixed ceramic material, mostly from the Karanovo Ill-TV, Hamangia IV, and Varna cultures, and a high con- centration of stones of differing sizes, without a visible order, left over from the use of the site as a Thracian ritual place. After last year's season, we established two main accumulation periods of the site. The first comprises the Karanovo III-IV (5500-5400 B.C.E.), Hamangia IV (4550-4500 B.C.E.), and Varna (4550/4500-4100 B.C.E.) cultures; the second includes the fourth cen- tury B.C.E. to the sixth century C.E. During the first period, the site was a fortified salt-mining center; dur- ing the second, it was a Thracian cultic center. COLONIA FLAVIA PACIS DEULTENSIUM Lyudmil F. Vagalinski, NIAM-BAS, reports: Deultum is one of the three Roman colonies in Bulgaria. It is the earliest, best preserved, and least in- Fig. 23. Residence 4 at Tell Provadia-Solnitsata, Karanovo III-IV culture (V. Petrova). vestigated among them. It lies 30 km southwest of the Black Sea city of Burgas, not far from the Bulgarian- Turkish border. The colony is the nucleus of a national archaeological preserve, with an area of 830,000 m2, including sites from the second millennium B.C.E. to the Late Medieval period. The city had its own Black Sea port until the 13th century C.E. We are now inves- tigating the urban fortification, baths, a public build- ing, and a tumular necropolis.30 In 2006, in the area of site 1 , we discovered a sec- ond east gate of Early Byzantine Deultum, flanked by two rectangular towers. The building of the gate took place between 457 and 498 C.E. (fig. 24). Its construction, together with the adjacent curtain wall, represents the first construction period for this site. For the second to fifth century C.E., we have recorded six such periods. It is noteworthy that the same con- struction line, along the four compass points, was fol- lowed during those 400 years. This line seems to have been established during the foundation of the colony in 70 C.E. Albeit far from the hectic Danubian limes, Deultum attracted frequent hostile attacks: we regis- tered eight fires of various strengths that occurred in the second through the fifth century C.E. The ninth fire destroyed the Early Byzantine eastern curtain wall during the sixth century C.E. (after 498 C.E). The second half of the fifth century C.E. marked consid- erable building activity. It is a period that is difficult to document archaeologically in Bulgaria, especially along the right bank of the lower Danube. High under- ground waters have prevented the investigation of lay- ers from the first decades of the colony. Within the gate, partially robbed out for building purposes, we found a brofize coin of the Byzantine em- 30 On the tumular necropolis, see Balabanov and Nenova-Merdjanova 2006.</page><page sequence="25">2008] ARCHAEOLOGY IN BULGARIA, 2006 SEASON 167 peror Nicephoros I and his son Stauracius (r. 803-81 1 C.E.) . It illustrates, together with the sparse fragments of Early Medieval Bulgarian pottery found at site 1, some human activity at the beginning of the ninth cen- tury C.E. Perhaps these finds relate to the capture of Deultum by Bulgarian Khan Krum (r. 803-814 C.E.), known from historical sources. APOLLONIA PONTICA Kristina Panayotova, NIAM-BAS, reports: The oldest Greek colony in Bulgaria, Apollonia Pontica, is the modern town of Sozopol. The intensive construction activity in the region of the necropolis during the past few years necessitates constant rescue excavations. We have found 916 grave installations so far, as well as numerous remains of commemorative rituals and structures associated with them from the middle of the fifth to the beginning of the second century B.C.E.31 In 2006, we investigated 203 grave installations; 183 of them date from the middle of the fifth to the end of the third century B.C.E. The necropolis is located on both sides of a coastal road, south of the modern town. Its territory is divided into family plots facing the road, surrounded by walls of quarried granite blocks and sandstone or limestone blocks (fig. 25). A small number of the burials in this necropolis are cremation burials. Cremation occurred outside the grave site during the fourth and third centuries B.C.E. The human remains and funerary gifts were buried in ceramic urns, red-figure kraters, pelikai, and hydriai, as well as amphoras, some of the "Cypriot" type. Most numerous among the inhumation grave in- stallations are the uncovered grave pits with no ad- ditional installations. In the middle of the fourth century B.C.E., construction of tile and cist graves be- gan, and we recorded remains of wooden coffins from many grave pits. Some of the deceased were placed directly in the pits (in a pithos or in an amphora) and were mostly oriented eastward and covered with tight cloth. The grave inventory is various, and the children's graves are richest. Perfume vessels are the most com- mon offering; most are lekythoi of local or Attic pro- duction (black-glazed, black- and red-figure, with red palmettes or netlike ornaments). Their mouths were broken before they were deposited. Notable are the vessels with plastic ornamentation, polychromy, and gilding. The grave gifts of the earlier burials included alabaster and glass alabastra and small ceramic and Fig. 24. South half of the second east Early Byzantine gate of Deultum (L.F. Vagalinski). glass amphoras, while the later burials contained bal- samaria. The terracottas found in many grave com- plexes represent various depictions of deities, people, animals, and cultic objects. Among the bone objects, the astragaloi&amp;ve the most numerous. Placed in graves of children and adults, they vary in size and are some- times doubly worked and/or perforated. Some have letters and traces of red paint. Rarer among the grave gifts are glass objects and objects of semiprecious stone; even rarer are tools and weapons. Many of the finds from the Apollonia necropolis were located outside the graves. These are single ves- sels or clusters of various jugs (entire or fragmented, with perforated bottoms) or amphoras with broken stands. The amphora tare found in the necropolis were mostly produced by workshops from Chios, Thasos, and Heraclea Pontica. The oval ritual hearths investigated are located out- side the wall. They contain bones from sheep, goats, pigs, and deer, as well as burnt hazelnuts and almonds. Their pottery includes the traditional vessels used in 31 On the necropolis investigations, see BeHe^HKOB and TepacHMOB 1963; IlaHaHOTOBa 1989, 2003; Panayotova 2003; Hermary and Panayotova 2006; Panayotova et al. 2006.</page><page sequence="26">168 IVO D.

The stelae recovered were attached with lead to rectangular bases or raised on special platforms con- structed along the peribolos line. They are mostly lime- stone, but some are elegant marble monuments with a pediment and acroteria. They record the names of Ionic Greeks who died around the end of the fifth/ beginning of the fourth century B.C.E. In 2006, we uncovered another 50 m of the aque- duct running through the necropolis, dating to the end of the fifth or beginning of the fourth century B.C.E. It was made of ceramic pipes connected with lead brackets. Its total length is about 150 m. The large-scale rescue excavations in 2006 provid- ed much new information about the funerary rituals of Apollonia Pontica. Their investigation gives us an idea about universal pan-Hellenic rituals and specific local rituals.
