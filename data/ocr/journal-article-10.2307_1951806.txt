XLIX JUNE, 1955 NO. 2 THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY ENLIGHTENMENT CUSHING STROUT Yale University It is no longer the rule among American intellectuals that to describe oneself as a conservative is to confess to intellectual bankruptcy. The new conservatives, on the contrary, make much of their sophistication in matters of philosophy and history, compared with the naivete of the liberals. That such a reversal of roles has been possible says much about what has passed for liberalism in modern America, for if the liberals had been historically realistic, profoundly humanistic, and uncom- promisingly individualistic, the present case for conservatism would lose much of its force. One is tempted to say, if only there had been more liberalism among the liberals, there would be less need for conservatism. To understand this curious situation it is essential to realize that it has been not the liberal but the progressive mentality that has held sway. When William James distinguished the "tough-minded" from the "tender-minded" he made a distinction that the progressive mind prided itself on making, and it was frank to say that "tough-minded- ness" was its peculiar virtue. It is for this trait that men like Thorstein Veblen, John Dewey, James Harvey Robinson, Harry Elmer Barnes, Carl Becker, and Charles A. Beard have been widely praised. This toughness was, supposedly, an empirical-mindedness that led to a healthy "revolt against formalism,"' as Morton G. White has aptly called it. The rebels were joined by a mutual stress on history and the "seamless web" of culture, as opposed to the abstractness and atomicity of the utilitarianism of Mill, Bentham, and Austin. This older tradition of English empiricism was not empirical enough; it was tainted by formalism and rationalism. The rebels wanted to break down the arti- ficial distinctions between politics, economics, law, and literature; they wanted to get away from first principles and study pragmatic conse- ' Social Thought in America: The Revolt against Formalism (New York, 1949). 321</page><page sequence="2">322 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW quences. Empirical "tough-mindedness" was to drive out rationalistic "tender-mindedness." This version of the progressive mentality (admirably anatomized by Mr. White) has been well recognized by the progressives them- selves. It is, after all, a flattering picture-but, nevertheless, a dis- torted one. It was not just a new empiricism that arose to challenge an old empiricism; it was also a new rationalism that challenged an old rationalism. If these progressives were insulated from the utopian and rationalistic allures of Marxian communism, with its "science" of society and its alleged cure for evil, it was partly because they were committed to a utopian rationalism of their own. What really distin- guished the progressive mind was not mere "tough-mindedness," but a "tough-mindedness" that was only the other side of a "tender- mindedness." This less flattering but more realistic portrait of progres- sivism needs to be examined. Such a double-sided strain of tough-tenderness is shot through the whole skein of Thorstein Veblen's ponderously ironic system of eco- nomics. He was proud to possess the virtues he ascribed to David Hume: "an alert, though somewhat histrionic, scepticism touching everything that was well received" and "an insistence on the prosy, not to say the seamy, side of human affairs." It was Hume's special talent to be irreverently skeptical of the need for any knowledge "that outruns the reach of his own matter-of-fact, step-by-step argument from cause to effect."2 To go beyond this was to indulge in animism, a defect Veblen observed in Christianity, Marxism, and the hedonistic utilitarianism of the classical economists. Thus Veblen praised the growth of modern science and the discipline of the machine process in industrial societies, because they promoted a factual habit of mind; and he witheringly condemned the pecuniary system of capitalism, based on absentee own- ership, because it developed minds that had "habits of recourse to con- ventional grounds of finality or validity, to anthropomorphism, to explanations of phenomena in terms of human relation, discretion, authenticity, and choice."3 Capitalism, in short, was too "tender- minded." Yet for all this bleak positivism, indeed because of it, Veblen was quite prepared to hitch his wagon to a star. His wife, Ellen Rolfe, claimed that their reading of Edward Bellamy's utopian novel Looking Backward helped turn Veblen away from philology towards economics. Nor was it accidental that, while a university tutor at Chicago in 1900, he trans- 2 "The Preconceptions of Economic Science," The Place of Science in Modern Civiliza- tion and other Essays (New York, 1919), pp. 96-97. 8The Theory of Business Enterprise (New York, 1904), p. 319.</page><page sequence="3">THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY ENLIGHTENMENT 323 lated Ferdinand Lassalle's Science and the Workingmen, a violent socialist tract. In Veblen's view, socialists, in standing on the materialistic ground of class solidarity and antagonism, were only reflecting the incidence of the machine process on culture. Indifferent to dynastic, national, or business ideals, socialists were "merely the extreme exponents of the spirit of the age in the modern industrial communities."4 Veblen's socialists were, in fact, conceived quite as abstractly as any utilitarian's "economic man" with his hedonic calculator, of which Veblen made so much fun. As a "tough-minded" Darwinian, Veblen had no use for Marxian dialectics; yet he scarcely disguised his sympathy for the Bolshevists when he analyzed the Russian Revolution as an editor of the Dial in 1919. Six months before his death in 1929 he even told a neighbor that communism seemed to offer the best hope at the present time.5 His insistence on the seamy side of human affairs was (no less than Marx's) quite compatible with a utopian longing for social salva- tion. Veblen's literary pose of professorial ponderosity did not conceal the embittered venom of his satirical jibes at the Vested Interests. The Communists expressed openly the hostility that was coiled in his style, and Veblen may have found their free display of aggressive disrespect for capitalism emotionally difficult to resist. As a theorist, however, he had his own characteristic solution for the problems of industrial society: technocracy. The whole system of property relations, involv- ing state, church, university, and corporation, was rooted in anthro- pomorphic habits of thought; the Humean capacity to observe only factual sequences of material cause and effect characterized the en- gineer. Social salvation lay with the passage of power from the pecun- iary-minded businessman to the industrially-minded engineer. It was this technocratic rationalism that Veblen worked out when he came in 1919 to the New School for Social Research as its most honored faculty member. The original faculty of the New School, and its visiting lecturers, made a dazzling constellation of some of the brightest stars in the progressive firmament: Charles A. Beard, James Harvey Robinson, John Dewey, and Harry Elmer Barnes. In all these men the vein of technocratic rationalism ran deep. In Veblen's view, absentee ownership and the price system were ir- rational hindrances to the technological development of industry. In his story the syndicate of investment bankers were the villains; the 4Ibid., p. 359. 5 Joseph Dorfman, Thorstein Veblen and His America (New York, 1934), p. 500.

The issue was melodramati- cally clean-cut and pristinely simple in its solution. A general strike of engineers (typically termed by Veblen "a conscientious withdrawal of efficiency"), supported by aggressively sympathetic elements of the trained working force of the major industries and the tolerant consent of an indoctrinated "underlying population," would bring the animistic and pecuniary "Guardians of the Vested Interests" to their knees. In this utopia, sketched in his The Engineers and the Price System in 1921, the ruling principle would be that there could be no "ownership of an industrially useful article by any person or persons who are not habitu- ally employed in the industrial use of it,"6 and the leadership of the community would fall to the "Soviet of Technicians." That Veblen and his friends took this dream seriously cannot be doubted.7 He and Robinson and Barnes attended a conference of technicians, including the president and secretary of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, to put the idea into action. Howard Scott and Stuart Chase listened devoutly to Veblen at the New School, and the first steps were taken which led to Scott's being ensconced fin- ally at Columbia as the prophet of Technocracy, after the depression had given many minds a hunger for some simple solution. The crisis of depression and the burgeoning of the technocratic movement brought Veblen's reputation to a new luster. His The Engineers and the Price System was reissued and became a best-seller. At a Conference for Progressive Political Action in 1933, a delegate made a Veblenian pro- posal for outlawing absentee ownership. Veblen, always something of a martyr because of his views, his prose, his taciturnity, his manners, and his love-life, was hailed as America's neglected genius by such molders of progressive opinion as Lewis Mumford, Stuart Chase, Mat- thew Josephson, John Chamberlain, and Rexford Guy Tugwell. The progressive mind had been seduced by technocratic rationalism. Nothing, quite naturally, came of Technocracy as a political move- ment. It was, after all, profoundly anti-political, even more so than the Platonic ideal of the philosopher-king. Technology can do nearly any- thing with Nature, it is clear, but it is necessarily silent about society. The technician may work to satisfy man's necessities, but these are, in their turn, as Ortega has pointed out, inventions: "Man is the animal that considers necessary only the objectively superfluous." It is the other animals who confine themselves to what life objectively requires- and they have no technology. Technology itself is rooted in man's super- fluous desires, his aspiration to be more than a biological creature. s The Engineers and the Price System (New York, 1921), p. 156. 7 For Veblen's relation to technocracy, see Dorfman, pp. 453-55, 459-60, and 510-18.</page><page sequence="5">THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY ENLIGHTENMENT 325 What could be farther from this spirit than Veblen's caustic exposure of the "invidious" non-utilitarian aspects of the leisure class! But even Veblen could not make of the rational engineer what he expected of him; he could not make a leader of a servant. Just because technology can do anything, to be an engineer and nothing but an engineer, as Ortega says, means "to be potentially everything and actually nothing." What could be more formalistic than mere possibility? If technology is unlimited in capacity, it will nevertheless "irretrievably empty the lives of those who are resolved to stake everything on their faith in it and it alone."8 We may suppose that Veblen discovered as much in his last years, though he did not recognize it. Why else was the father of Tech- nocracy compelled, finally, to look to communism for his hopes? The vacuum had to be filled. If the Soviet of Technicians seemed too ab- stract to bolster hope and relieve despair, then there remained the Soviet of Bolshevism. In philosophy it was, of course, John Dewey who spoke for the pro- gressive mind. His Reconstruction in Philosophy (1920) challenged classical, traditional philosophies as "compensatory," "dialectically formal," and arrogantly concerned with an alleged absolute, "superior" Reality. Against this tender-mindedness Dewey opposed the Baconian vision that Knowledge is Power; but for all his stress on the matter-of- fact achievements of empirical science, Dewey believed that "the pa- tient and experimental study of nature, bearing fruit in inventions which control nature and subdue her forces to social uses, is the method by which progress is made." Applied science, moving into new areas, in- sured us a glorious future: "The Golden Age lies ahead of us not behind us."9 Though Dewey confessed'0 that Veblen's distinction between the technical and commercial factors in business had been "quite funda- mental" to his thinking ever since he became acquainted with it, he did not draw up, like Veblen, any blue-print of a technocratic utopia. "Men have constructed a strange dream-world when they have sup- posed that without a fixed ideal of a remote good to inspire them, they have no inducement to get relief from present troubles, no desires for liberation from what oppresses and for clearing up what confuses pre- sent action."" Dewey was a meliorist, settling for present and piecemeal increments of progressive reconstruction. But if he sensibly shunned any 8 Jos6 Ortega y Gasset, "Man the Technician," Toward a Philosophy of History (New York, 1941), pp. 100, 151. 9 Reconstruction in Philosophy, enlarged.

For Dewey was also in his way hypnotized by the achieve- ments of modern technology, that knowledge which was power. When Beard edited a book of essays on the theme of progress, rather anxi- ously called Whither Mankind, it was Dewey who wrote the piece on philosophy. For him it was clear that any modern philosophy worthy of the name was essentially a theory of "the relation of means and ends, of the materially existent and the ideally possible based on the control of agencies and instrumentalities which the new technology has brought with itself.... 12 If technology is the means, what are the ends? They emerge, rather vaguely, at the end of his Reconstruction in Philosophy, after an appeal to "the method of intelligence," symbolized by the triumphs of science and technology. Somewhat tender-mindedly for a tough-minded em- piricist, Dewey speaks of "the mystic force" of communication and "the miracle of shared life" which will, apparently, bathe "the hard- ness and crudeness of contemporary life ... in the light that never was on land or sea." In this brave new world, poetry and religious feeling will be "the unforced flowers of life."'3 This fragrant future is to be our compensation for having put well behind us the compensatory and contemplative philosophies of the past, so tender-minded in their ap- proach to reality! A genuinely hard-headed feeling for reality must be nurtured, one would think, on the historical sense, with its awareness of the stubborn variety of human life and its changing, concrete responsibilities so im- pervious to the demands of hedonists and reformers alike. But when we turn to the progressive historians, we see how completely the historical sense has been blunted in them by a utopian, technocratic rationalism. This anti-historical mood appears, at its most popular level, in the sloganeering of the "New History" movement that arose at Columbia University under the leadership of James Harvey Robinson and Harry Elmer Barnes. It was the burden of their message to his- torians that the time had come to talk of shoes and ships, and sealing wax and cabbages, instead of kings. They inveighed against the "or- thodox historian" who seemed to be by their definition, as Carl Becker once remarked, "a timid, refined professor, a little apprehensive about holding his job, who is interested in political, military, and diplomatic events, is unaware of the importance of economic, social, and cultural influences, and greatly exaggerates the role of individuals as causal 12 "Philosophy," Whither Mankind: A Panorama of Modern Civilization (New York, 1928), p. 328. 13 Reconstruction in Philosophy, pp. 211, 213.</page><page sequence="7">THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY ENLIGHTENMENT 327 factors in the historic process."'4 But the turn to economic, social, and cultural history had already begun even in America before the "New History," and it was the research and theorizing of Frederick Jackson Turner, rather than the campaigning of Robinson and Barnes, that signified the change. Nevertheless, the contempt of the "New Histor- ians" for their predecessors was indicative of their generally contemp- tuous view of the historical past. Robinson had been a scholarly historian, however, before he became the bearer of the glad tidings of the "New History." In his title-essay, therefore, of The New History: Essays Illustrating the Modern Historical Outlook, he made a sensible plea for busying ourselves with the reasons why thoughtful, well-intentioned people defended the evils of the past instead of wasting our time in a gratuitious denunciation of them. Yet his ideology corrupted this historical sense in the same essay: "The present has hitherto been the willing victim of the past; the time has come when it should turn on the past and exploit it in the interests of ad- vance."'15 In the concluding essay, "The Spirit of Conservatism in the Light of History," he spoke, in the tones of a vague, pulpit unction, of "the refusal to cooperate with the vital principle of betterment" as the "long-disputed sin against the Holy Ghost."'6 For all his sociological and psychological skepticism of religion, it was perfectly clear that Robinson was forming a new mystery cult dedicated to Intelligence. It was he who wrote the debunking essay on religion for Beard's Whither Mankind, and he made it plain that to the query quo vadis? he had his own answer: "The effort to engineer life in the light of already exist- ing intelligence would in itself be perhaps as holy a task as any hitherto essayed by saint or martyr."'7 The anti-historical tendencies of this point of view come out boldly in Robinson's vastly popular The Mind in the Making, a plea for the application of "liberated Intelligence" to man's problems. History is chiefly illustrative, in his view, of the residues of the animal, the savage, and the child in adult mentality. The past is seen as an encum- brance of illusions and maladjustments from which man needs freedom- like the habit of metaphysical thinking which Robinson tolerates, as he would the tobacco habit, provided the indulgence is moderate. Modern man is urged to take his cues from the founders of science, Bacon, Galileo, and Descartes: "These founders of modern natural sci- 14 "What Is Historiography?," American Historical Review., Vol. 44, pp. 20-28, at p. 22 (Oct., 1938). 15 The New History (New York, 1912), p. 24. 16 Ibid., p. 265. 17 Whither Mankind, p. 286.</page><page sequence="8">328 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW ence realized that they would have to begin afresh. This was a bold re- solve, but not so bold as must be that of the student of mankind to-day if he expects to free himself from the trammels of the past."'8 Rational action, then, was based on a Reason that did not come trailing clouds of glory, but sprang up full grown from the thinker's brow, and the glory it did not trail was all the more golden for being anticipated in tomorrow's sunrise. Modern knowledge had cracked open all the seals on the Book of History: "The book at last lies open before those who are capable of reading it, and few they be as yet; for most of us still cling to the guesses made in regard to its contents before anyone knew what was in it."'' Contemptuous of the past, complacent about the present, and starry- eyed before the future, the progressive revived all the anti-historical proclivities of the Enlightenment rationalists. Like them, he saw his own age in such terms that it could not be historically continuous with the past; scornful of miracles, he seemed to make of the sudden emer- gence of his own age into rationality an incomprehensible miracle. How had such dazzling light sprung from such bleak darkness? Crusading against superstition and prejudice, he had a touching, if narrow, faith in the efficacy of science to solve all problems and a passionate prejudice that his technical view of reason would promote progress. Traditionally, the liberal and the democrat have both been primarily concerned with making political power responsible and with attacking the pretensions of any class to wield a privileged authority. But the progressives were so infatuated with their sense of being specially enlightened that they felt free to indulge an unchecked dream of absolute power. Harry Elmer Barnes warmed to the idea of placing the present technological age "under the control and direction of those who combine an adequate command of scientific and technological facts with the broad and con- structive outlook which comes from acquaintance with the social sciences."20 Under the benevolent despotism of this self-elected elite, we could relax in the assurance of social progress. The Guardians of social science would maintain the Republic. "If this extension of scien- tific control over society is an impossible aspiration," warned Barnes in an apocalyptic vein, "then the 'jig is up' with the human race."'" With a bland blindness to what they were proposing, the progressives urged the manipulation of society by social "scientists," as if individual and social values were mere laboratory data. 18 The Mind in the Making: The Relation of Intelligence to Social Reform (New York, 1921), p. 154. 19 Ibid., p. 227. 20 Barnes, The New History and the Social Studies (New York, 1925), p. 401. 21 "James Harvey Robinson," American Masters of Social Science, ed.

Carl L. Becker and Charles A. Beard, it is true, made themselves known in the historical profession as eloquent and scathing skeptics of the old- fashioned "science of history," with its pseudo-scientific determinism. But even their pragmatic relativism, which led them to kneel humbly at Clio's feet to say, in Becker's epigram, "O History, how many truths have been committed in thy name!" had its strong undertow of utopian rationalism. If they challenged the illusions of the "scientific" historian, neutral in thought and deed, they did so in order to defend the his- torian's right to be a reformer. History, Becker used to say, quoting Voltaire, was "a pack of tricks we play on the dead," and the illusion was performed by mixing memory and desire, documents and hopes, to fabricate a useful image of the past. Beard, too, challenged scientism to defend the historian's "act of faith" in history as an "upward gradient to a more ideal order"-in his case, collectivist democracy. The histor- ian endures, he felt, "only in so far as he succeeds in casting through the warp of the past the weft of the future-the future which he can behold only by prophetic discernment."22 Both Becker and Beard, in short, were devotees of the idea of progress which had so enchanted the En- lightenment thinkers. Becker was most at home as a historian with the rationalist philos- ophers of the Enlightenment whose intellectual world he analyzed with eloquent wit, precision, and love. His affinity for this subject was profound, for, as his colleagues and students have sometimes wisely remarked, he was himself a twentieth-century philosophe, his Progress and Power being a modern version of Condorcet's Outlines of an His- torical View of the Progress of the Human Mind. The "heavenly city of the eighteenth-century philosophers" was to be built anew on the solid foundations of technology and social science instead of rationalistic republicanism. Becker's idea of progress defined power as man's use of tools, from the stone flint of the ape-man to the electric eye in the Pennsylvania Station. Invention was, in his view, the mother of neces- sity, and history could be meaningfully periodized into four phases by the discoveries of fire, writing, and magnetic force. Through these stages man advanced from farming and hunting to politics, to religion, and 22 "James Ford Rhodes, " New Republic, Vol. 21, p. 83 (Dec. 17, 1919).

Progress had really become systematically possible only with the elaboration of mathematical science, for progress came about "by the slow, often interrupted, but fairly persistent extension of matter-of-fact knowledge and matter-of-fact apprehension to an ever widening realm of experience."28 Becker is well known among historians for his trenchant criticisms of "scientific" history, allegedly devoted to cold, hard facts, as isolatable as marbles, and supposedly set forth by the omniscient and passive neutrality of the historian's mind. To write history, he kept maintain- ing, was not like "dumping a barrow of bricks"; it was, on the contrary, to engage in an inevitably relative and limited evaluation of human thoughts and deeds. Yet, in his theory of progress, Becker was committed to the conviction that history, in the long run, "gives its validation to matter-of-fact knowledge while dismissing value judgments as useless or insufficiently discriminated." He had quite unwittingly thus made a low bow to an idol he had already condemned as a superstition. He had begun his meditation on progress with a repudiation of any absolutes that would enable one to measure progress in terms of passage to some known good end, but this gesture of skepticism was only a ritual per- formed as part of his devotions at the altar of science. What he proph- esied was a time when new sources of power would be exhausted and man would face a stable world. Progress would then become unnecessary because its purpose would be fulfilled. In this "stabilized and scientif- ically adjusted society," man would make a complete adjustment of his ideas and habits to the body of matter-of-fact knowledge he had accum- ulated about himself and the world.24 History was, then, heading toward a fixed, known good end: the adjusted society. 0 brave new world that had so much reason in it! On Becker's time scale of 506,000 years, the third phase, in which the consequences of the invention of writing are explored, is a mere inter- lude between the age of primitive man, who achieved balance by seeing the outer world as an extension of himself, and the age of modern scien- tific man, who finds his poise through seeing his personality as an ex- tension of the outer world of things. The development of non-technical thought resulted in futile attempts to reconcile man to his gods through conceptualization and idealization. Becker implicitly condemns it as a kind of fall from grace. Here his radically unhistorical view of man's destiny is dramatically revealed, for lhe transforms the historical situa- tion into the scientific situation of man's relation to nature through 23 Progress and Power (Stanford, 1936), p. 96.

In this scheme, history's fulfillment is its termination, and the course of events is made meaningful only at the price of interpreting it in terms of a static goal beyond and outside of history. Yet the "adjusted" society is a pernicious abstraction, for it is either a society without basic human purposes or a tyranny in which the scientific elite executes its own private purposes under the pretense of mere engineer- ing. Becker had confused liberalism with technocratic rationalism, which was based not on moral and political principles but on the techniques for manipulating objects. Reason, from his point of view, was a far cry from that interpreter of the "self-evident truths" of the Declaration of Independence. He had felt the confidence in 1915 to conclude an ac- count of the American Revolution with the judgment that the sweeping generalities of the Declaration had formulated "those basic truths which no criticism can seriously impair, and to which the minds of men must always turn, so long as faith in democracy shall endure."25 But a world war and a mass depression had shaken that confidence to its founda- tions, while at the same time he was coming to think that science dic- tated a pragmatic view of reason as only "a function of the animal organism, and truth no more than the perception of discordant experi- ence pragmatically adjusted for a particular purpose and for the time being."26 By 1936 he had concluded, with astringent skepticism, that both liberal democracy and communism were only "useful social myths" based on "emotionally held preconceptions" that determined the selection of facts that appeared to support them. Yet for all this mood of disillusionment he hoped to bring "spiritual first-aid to a harassed generation," and his disenchantment was only with one ver- sion of reason; he was thoroughly and naively enchanted by technical reason. Reason drunk speculated on moral and political principles; reason sober pragmatically adjusted itself to circumstances or advanced tentative hypotheses. "One may suppose then," said Becker, appealing from reason drunk to reason sober, "that in the future (the distant future no doubt, if one is to judge from present-day trends of thought) the realm of the matter-of-fact apprehension of experience may be so greatly extended that the effective social ideology will take on the flexible, pragmatic character of a scientific hypothesis."27 The vacuum of value he had created, however, gave him little sup- port in the wind-tunnels of modern history when they were being filled 25 Beginnings of the American People, The Riverside History of the United States, ed.

If Becker gave his loyalty to the coming society of statically adjusted forces, the process of "scientific" stabilization might involve the humane and liberal values he wanted to believe in, or it might not. It could be that they would be eliminated as mere value judgments "insufficiently discriminated." In any case, what glad tidings of the future were being sung by Nazis and Communists just then had little music in them to please the liberal and humane ear. The scientist, in putting nature on trial, could calmly await the results of his tentative hypothesis. But Becker was not in the laboratory; he was in history, himself on trial, the stakes too high for tentativeness. By 1940 he felt his position direly threatened by the rise of Hitler and Stalin to enormous power. This certainly was not what he meant by successful adjustment to circumstances! Reason was limited, but it was not so bankrupt that it could not challenge such hyperbolic pretensions as these. Somewhere a stand had to be taken; the difficulty was that now it was very hard to find solid ground. Old-fashioned reason and principle had been debunked as mere ideology. The mood of hard-boiled realism had led to a drastic undervaluation of the merit of democratic institutions, and it was believed that scientific reason had made its grim report that there was no order in man or nature. It was a strange paradox that "the astonishing conclusion was somehow reached that an age which regarded every belief as open to doubt had at last got the low-down on men and things."28 A generation which would not on any account be "taken in," he concluded in 1944, had been "taken in" by its very fear of being "taken in." The heavenly city of the eighteenth- century philosophers had been erected, for all its brave show of reason, on dogma and faith, that is, the "laws of Nature and of Nature's God," and it was Becker who had pointed it out with an appreciative irony. Yet he was now himself, as his life drew to a close, retracing his steps to those sweeping generalities. There were, after all, "Some Generalities that Still Glitter." By the time he wrote his essay on "What is Still Living in the Political Philosophy of Thomas Jefferson," he had decided that the values of democracy were enduring, for they had a life of their own apart from any particular civilization: "one reason for believing so being the fact that the values we cherish are the same as those which Jefferson proclaimed and the same as those which for more than two thousand years the saints and sages of the world have regarded as the ideal aim and ultimate test of civilized living."29 28 "What We Didn't Know Hurt Us a Lot," Yale Review, Vol. 33, pp. 385-404, at p. 391 (March, 1944). 29 American Historical Review, Vol. 48, pp. 691-706, at p. 706 (July, 1943).

What, after all, could this consensus of saints and sages be but a pale abstraction from history, not only doing violence to the tensions and oppositions of the past, but soaring at last beyond history altogether? The facile detachment from history that had generated Becker's spiri- tual problem reappeared in his return to the dreams of the Enlighten- ment. "In all of his dealings with men and affairs," he once wrote, "one feels that Franklin was never wholly committed."30 But surely this judgment was in part an act of self-criticism. Becker's extraordinary charm, his amiable, urbane disenchantment, which is the play of a bitter-sweet reason over the fancies and fanaticisms of a violent world, has a certain fragility. In the drama of history we cannot pretend to enjoy the privileged detachment of either actor or writer. History pro- poses tasks, not parts, and to bear its burdens man must always finally assume a responsibility and a risk which are, for him, absolute. The relativity of history is not pragmatic; its conflicts are not local troubles that can be adjusted as a plumber might fix a leaky pipe. The pragma- tist, who sees man as a manipulator of history, is blind to history's desperation, the grimness of a process which demands absolute decisions from men who live in a relative, finite situation. Nor does this historical relativity nurture a skeptical indifference, for the relativity of history is only its pluralism: the fact that men meet its challenges and suffer its changes as representatives of a particular, finite vehicle of the his- torical process, a community that has its life only in history. This pluralism is the real toughness of history and its intolerableness to those who wish to lay up their treasures where the rust and stain of time cannot corrupt them. The heresy of history-a stumbling block to both scientists and theologians-is that it proclaims the finite absolute when its heroes are pressed to say, "Here I stand; I can do no other." For history has its being not in man's power over his environment or in his communion with self-evident, immutable truths, but rather in the creative labors of the human will seeking to organize its values in the world of formal institutions. History's conflicts can be composed by neither technology nor intellect, however skilled; they can be resolved only by the will that suffers them. One might expect that Charles A. Beard, so widely revered for his "tough-minded" emphasis on economic interests that shape history, would be sarcastically scornful of the utopian dreams of the technocratic rationalists. But utopianism is, after all, particularly evident in Karl Marx's economic determinism.

The paradox is deeply imbedded in Beard's thought too. With almost Calvinistic grim satisfaction, he remarks how the hopes and fears of both slaveholders and abolitionists were finally confounded by the conse- quences of annexing Texas that ended in civil war: "So dim is the vision of the wisest of statesmen! So far astray do the calculations of the learned and the great lead them!"'" As the war approaches, Beard's sense of the havoc fate plays with man's schemes grows: "In that milling tumult, not one statesman foresaw the immediate future or read cor- rectly the handwriting on the wall. ... All were caught up and whirled in a blast too powerful for their wills, too swift for their mental opera- tions." Yet in this same history, the impressively sweeping two volumes of The Rise of American Civilization, he brings his narrative to a radiant conclusion: If the generality of opinion, as distinguished from that of poignant specialists, was taken into account, there was no doubt about the nature of the future in America. The most common note of assurance was belief in unlimited progress the continuous fulfillment of the historic idea which had slowly risen through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to a position of commanding authority. Concretely it meant an invulnerable faith in democracy . .. [and] a faith in the efficacy of that new and mysterious instrument of the modern mind, "the in- vention of invention," moving from one technological triumph to another ... effecting an ever wider distribution of the blessings of civilization . . . conjuring from the vasty deeps of the nameless and unknown creative imagination of the noblest order, subduing physical things to the empire of the spirit-doubting not the capacity of the Power that had summoned into being all patterns of the past and present, living and dead, to fulfill its endless destiny.32 It was, Beard felt in 1927, "the dawn, and not the dusk of the gods." But if he could call spirits from the vasty deep, it was clear two years later that they would not come when called. Yet he never wavered in his faith in this idea of progress; it was a theme that unified his dramatic intellectual career, from his early association with the founders of the British Labour party to his last embittered days as a defender of Re- publican isolationism.

It was man's ability to build machinery competent to replace manual labor with the infinite power of nature that gave him the "material key to man's spiritual progress,"33 and it was in this way that modern philosophes, spurning sham battles with "ancient devils, fog giants, metaphysical dragons," could find a common-sense remedy to the evils of the In- dustrial Revolution. When he was made president in 1926 of the Amer- ican Political Science Association, he reiterated this theme by hailing technology as the means of implementing the concept of indefinite progress sketched in the eighteenth century by the Abbe de Saint- Pierre.34 It was entirely fitting that Beard should write the introduction to J. B. Bury's The Idea of Progress for its first American edition in 1932. As a relativist, who was, in the following year, to address as presi- dent his colleagues of the American Historical Association on "Written History as an Act of Faith" and who was soon after to scorn his- torical objectivity as "That Noble Dream," Beard was prepared to concede for the sake of argument that the past had been "without order or design"; yet he was still "haunted by the shadowing thought that by immense efforts of will and intelligence, employing natural science as the supreme instrumentality of power, mankind may rise above necessity into the kingdom of freedom, subduing material things to humane and rational purposes."35 What, then, were these ends, if science was only a means? Beard was not so utopian as to expect something for nothing: he sensed, more clearly then Veblen or Becker, Robinson or Barnes, that technical machines could not fulfill non-technical hopes. Yet Beard believed that American life has always been "tough-minded": "in the main hard, economic, and realistic-a conquest of material things, and [that] American thought has been essentially empirical, not metaphysical and theological."36 So progress in America would be materialistic, "mass progress, measurable in averages and susceptible of graphic presenta- tion."37 It would be identifiable as the economy of abundance; this was 33 The Industrial Revolution (London, 1901), p. 42.

This goal could be obtained, he felt, through planning, that talisman of rationalism. He had himself con- cretely observed the power of planning when he had gone to Tokyo at the Home Minister's request to advise on municipal politics during the reconstruction of the city after the earthquake of 1923. There the vision seemed almost a reality, and when the depression had struck America, Beard sketched a Five Year Plan to bring into existence the economy of abundance by a centralized authority adequate to control the planless irrationality of the market place.38 Beard had long ago defined the great historian as a man of faith who cast the weft of the future through the warp of the past by an act of prophetic discernment: he was now prepared to qualify for the role himself. With increasing passion his historical work became a ten- dentious argument for the necessity of fulfilling the Promise of Ameri- can Life. President Roosevelt had begun well with the New Deal, but there lurked the dangers of distraction by involvement in foreign quarrels. By the time of the Nye Committee's investigations in 1934, Beard had become finally convinced that it was the pressure of bankers that had forced Wilson into war. Thus his habitual confidence that the economic interpretation was a mark of "tough-mindedness" enabled him to join the ranks of the highly emotional and sensationalistic "revisionists," whom, in the person of Harry Elmer Barnes, he had once correctly criticized for forgetting the realities of the balance of power and its effect on America in order to indulge in an unhistorical shifting around of "heroes" and "villains." For all his lectures against "The Devil Theory of War," Beard was engaged in concocting one, and by February, 1935 he had already ominously predicted that President Roosevelt would plunge the country into a Pacific war in his efforts to escape the domestic economic crisis.39 88 For Beard's advocacy of centralized planning, see his introduction to Toward Civiliza- tion, ed.

For Beard's defense of Wilson's intervention and his criticism of Barnes' revisionism see "Heroes and Villains of the World War," Current History, Vol. 24, pp. 730-35 (Aug., 1926). For all his polemic against dogmatism about historical causality, he concluded by 1936 that the "President of the United States avoided an immediate domestic crash by leading the country into war." See The Devil Theory of War (New York, 1936), pp. 107. Beard then became a passionate pamphleteer and advocate before congressional commit- tees of an isolationist policy which he expounded as "continentalism" in such works as The Idea of National Interest: An Analytical Study in American Foreign Policy, collab. G. H. E. Smith (New York, 1934); Giddy Minds and Foreign Quarrels: An Estimate of American Foreign Policy (New York, 1939); and A Foreign Policy for America (New York, 1940).</page><page sequence="17">THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ENLIGHTENMENT 337 His last two books, dogged attempts at documenting his indictment of Roosevelt's foreign policy,40 seem in retrospect to be offerings on the altar of his dream of the Promise of American Life. By September 1, 1948, when America's most influential historian faced death in the belief that all over the world the dusk of the gods had darkly fallen at last, he must have felt that his dream was even more remote than it had been in 1927 when he saluted the new technology that would usher in the dawn. With what a bitter sense of outraged sanity must Beard for the past decade have watched history move, not towards his cherished goal of a last outpost of "collectivist democracy" where men reaped the harvests of technological triumph, but instead toward intervention in another world war! With all his utopian passion Beard had urged the American people and their Congress to create a last "stronghold of order and sanity even against the gates of hell."4' His "act of faith" had been a bold toss of the dice, and the stakes were too high for him to lose gracefully. Someone must have rigged the game. There had, there- fore, to be some dark soul who had arrogantly upset the best laid plans of thinking men. So his last works were counter-plots against the arch- conspirator Roosevelt, bringing to bear against the latter's record all of Beard's formidable powers of scholarly assault and analysis. His brilliant career thus blazed out at the end like a spent rocket's last flare, glittering but erratic, as he became unhappily entangled in the unhistorical simplicities of a conspiratorial theory of history, the nemesis of all utopians because, as Karl Popper has remarked, "the only explanation of their failure to produce their heaven are the evil intentions of the devil who has a vested interest in hell."42 The systematic errors of political rationalism have been lucidly an- alyzed by Michael Oakeshott43 in terms that can be applied most fruit- fully to these progressive thinkers. He has pointed out that it is a char- acteristic mistake of the rationalist to attribute to tradition the rigidity which really characterizes his ideology of Progress. The rationalist is at 40 American Foreign Policy in the Making 1932-1940: A Study in Responsibilities (New Haven, 1946) and President Roosevelt and the Coming of the War: A Study in Appearances and Realities (New Haven, 1948).

History through a Beard," Atlantic, Vol. 182, pp. 91-97 (Aug., 1948). Unfortunately, both Rauch and Mori- son imply that Beard distorted his evidence dishonestly, but this is to attack one devil theory with another. Beard's point of view simply blinded him to the non-invidious impli- cations of his evidence. 41 From Beard's testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, put into the Record by Senator Burton K.

Being blind to reason's rich historical dimension, he reduces thinking man to the power to imitate the process of a machine that tabulates me- chanically. For reason must operate within a tradition, and it is tradi- tion alone that generates the shape of the problem to be solved. For the pragmatic rationalist, however, mere existence or long existence have no value, as Dewey put it, "independent of what deliberate action might make out of the existent."44 Since the rationalist does not believe that action should be performed in the light of the past, he is easily led to find his illumination in an abstract future, radiant with the glitter of utopia. For him the method of intelligence is simply the method of science, and by this equation he not only blinds himself to the non- scientific but responsible uses of reason-as in philosophy and history- but he fails as well to grasp the historical character of scientific reason itself. To be genuinely scientific, after all, is not to be merely intelligent; for, as Oakeshott has warned, if you are "merely 'intelligent' about a boiler or an electrical generator, you are likely to be pulled up short by an explosion; but in politics all that happens is war and chaos, which you do not immediately connect with your error."45 The progressive development of science itself depends upon a scientific community based on a sophisticated awareness of the complex conventions of a traditional activity. If he did not know his scientific tradition, every scientist would have to begin from scratch; yet it is just this absurdity that the progressive political mind recommends in human affairs. Utopian rationalism is, of course, historically connected with the Enlightenment philosopher. Yet in America, as Louis Hartz and Daniel J. Boorstin have recently shown46 with great acumen, our revolutionary heroes and founding fathers were remarkably free from the pretensions and illusions of the "age of reason." Jefferson, Madison, and Adams agreed that a constitutionally limited government of checks and bal- ances was the only protection against both anarchy and tyranny. It was, indeed, the devoutly liberal Jefferson who argued that confidence in the men of our choice was the very parent of despotism; "free govern- ment," he said, "is founded in jealousy and not in confidence; it is jeal- ousy and not confidence which prescribes limited constitutions to bind 44 "Philosophy," Whither Mankind, p. 330. 45 "Rational Conduct," Cambridge Journal, Vol. 4, pp. 3-27, at p. 14 (Oct., 1950). 46 Louis Hartz, "American Political Thought and the American Revolution," this RE- VIEW, Vol. 46, pp. 321-42 (June, 1952); Daniel J.

Rousseau or Condorcet inhabited a world intellectually, as well as historically, alien. Not until the twentieth century, when the triumphs of the machine and the scientist had seduced men's imaginations into dreaming of unlimited and perpetual progress through technology, and the "revolt against formalism" had devalued the importance of principles, did utopianism capture the American liberal mind. The revival of a genu- inely tough-minded and principled liberalism may depend on a re- newed sense of the vitality and significance of forms, for it should be the special pride of liberalism that it alone puts its ultimate confidence in moral and legal procedures, not in pragmatic programs, in respect for democratic political institutions, not in dreams of a planned society, in the complexities of the historical sense, not in the simplicities of a sur- render to "scientific" progress. If the refurbishing of such forms as these has lately been partly in the hands of the "new conservatives," then it is an ominous sign that liberals have been letting conservatives do their work for them. But liberals may perhaps find ground, for con- fidence in the possibility that some of the luster and popularity of the new conservatism is only a reflected glow of light from the liberal lamp that once belonged and should return to its proper guardians. 47 Kentucky Resolutions, November 16, 1798.
