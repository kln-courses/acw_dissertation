<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dancing Patterns Eric C. H. de Bruyn David Joselit. Feedback:Television against Democracy. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2007. 210 pp., 53 b/w ills. $ 19.9s David Joselit has written a programmatic book that strives to reclaim a tactical advan tage for art history on the contemporary battleground of images. Drawing its case studies from a vast reservoir of televisual images, events, and performances, Feedback ranges across what the author defines as an integrated "image ecology," in which artis tic, activist, and commercial subsystems of image production, manipulation, and circu lation feed into each other, creating unex pected disturbances and opening deviant trajectories within the "closed circuits" of a privatized public sphere dominated by broadcast television Joselit raises the stakes high. Whereas the ostensible subject of Feedback is the pre carious forms of counterpublicity that emerged within the United States during the nascent age of broadcast television, Joselit casts the relevance of his study to the present in urgent terms. The reader only has to turn to the brief "Manifesto" at the end to read that "this book was written in a period of stunning reversals for democracy, sold to Media-America in the name of fear and patriotism" (171). Declaring his impatience with much current scholarship in art history, which resigns itself to inventing "new" moves within a familiar "game of aesthet ics," Joselit further presents Feedback as an ambitious opening gambit?"a challenge to artists and art historians alike, including myself"?in a game of media strategies still rarely played by art historians. Hence, Joselit seeks not only to remedy what he perceives as a state of methodical exhaustion within the field of art history, but to take art history to task for its faltering ability to reposition itself within a mediascape that has seen the blossoming of a specious "poli tics of the image." What should recommend this pioneer ing effort to students of art history and media studies alike is not only that there is much to be learned from Joselit's genealogi cal mode of reasoning, which often makes surprising connections between different positions within the cultural field of media production. Feedback also succeeds in opening up several methodological questions that were prematurely closed off by the discipli nary feud between art history and visual cul ture during the previous decade. ' Although I subscribe to the necessity of recasting art history in terms of a media critique rather continuing to write a history of mediums, I am less inclined to travel as far as Joselit in the direction of a politics of image. Feedback, however, knows no such restraints, and in the burst of excitement that comes with a discovery of a new field of research, it moves along at such a breakneck speed, while scanning "the patterns traced by objects in the course of their 'social lives,'" that the transitions between successive frameworks of analysis sometimes become difficult to follow (83). Typical of his approach is how Joselit presses into critical service certain period tropes, such as "ecol ogy" or "feedback," thereby creating a high ly useful toolbox of analytical concepts on the one hand, but reducing the complex his toricity of the very terms he puts in play on the other hand. I shall return to such con cerns below, but first the main objectives and methodological procedures of Feedback need to be introduced. The introduction clearly defines the three main goals of Feedback: (1) the pursuit of an "apparatical analysis of the television system during its initial or 'network' era," a period extending from the 19 cos into the late 1970s (xii); (2) a definition of the "problems and opportunities involved in conducting politics through images as opposed to the persistent if misguided conviction that public discourse consists primarily of rational linguistic debate" (xiii); and (3) a refashioning of art-historical methodology as "a kind of eco-formalism whose object is interrelated image ecologies rather than individual art works" (xii). What requires "formalist" analysis is not the object, but the circuits by which objectivity (and subjec tivity) becomes distributed within the con temporary networks of information and exchange. Indeed, "one might argue," Joselit claims, "the whole history of modernism has been a response to the short-circuiting of humans and objects in which bodies and things have grown into one another as cyborgs and fetishes" (28).Thus, as Joselit explains, the electronic mechanisms of scan 115 art journal ning and feedback are not only to be isolat ed as the constitutive elements of televisions reproductive and broadcast technology, but also employed as formal methodologies of critique. Television is to provide both the object of study and the interpretive frame work (31). The first goal is per haps not the most radical, but it is significant that Joselit mentions Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge 's important 1972 study of public tele vision in Germany, Public Sphere and Experience: Toward an Analysis of the Bourgeois and Proletarian Public Sphere, as influential to his own approach. Nevertheless, Joselit fails to address the significantly different sociopolit ical and institutional situation in which Negt and Kluge developed their notion of televi sual counterpublics. Joselit's decision to focus exclusively on the history of network television in the United States may have pragmatic reasons, but it is also a slightly unhappy choice, since his argument would have gained greater depth and versatility by comparison with other national television systems, which enabled other possibilities of reappropriation and disruption. Not wanting to sound niggardly, however, I see a far more important lesson to be gained from a globalized view of television. Whereas Joselit frequently casts his argument in terms of homogeneity?the disciplined speech of commercial television?versus diversifica tion?the fractious speech of minorities and subaltern groups?it is precisely the latter term that describes current strategies to cap ture audiences worldwide. Although Joselit clearly states that his oppositional principle of diversification in the end does not escape from the capitalist principle of valorization, I would caution that this term deserves to be used in a more circumspect manner. Joselit's second aim raises a more perti nent set of issues: how is one to reconcile an image-based politics with the preceding demand for an apparatical analysis of televi sion? What motivates Joselit's earlier phrase concerning the conduct of "politics through images" is the need to differentiate the media publics of Feedback from the classical ideal of the public sphere as formulated by J?rgen Habermas?an ideal based on a face to-face model of polite speech that could only conceive of the influence of television Reviews</page><page sequence="2">in negative terms.2 It is to this discursive model of the public sphere that Negt and Kluge famously responded in the early 1970s by pointing out the political necessity of working through the televisual apparatus as an all-pervasive form of social mediation within everyday life.3 Kluge even took this task literally by developing his own television programs. Yet this debate remains largely implicit in Feedback. Joselit is less interested in advancing a general theory of how demo cratic publics may be constituted within the institutional domain of broadcast televi sion?he entertains no illusions in this area?than in locating those brief and ephemeral moments when counterpublics "flash into being" before disintegrating again or being recuperated by the media industry (131). "Democracy" appears in Feedback, therefore, not so much "against" but as the afterimage of "television." It is symptomatic that many of the most virulent forms of political aesthetics Joselit discusses are mediated through film and not through television.4 Thus Joselit argues that resistance occurs largely in the margins or fissures of the dominant televisual system, where it is con stantly reenergized by procedures of signal jamming and diversion. There are one or two exceptions within this narrative, figures of a more frontal assault on broadcast tele vision?such as the media activist Abbie Hoffman, who broadcast "advertisements for revolution," and Michael Shamberg, the author of the Guerrilla Television handbook, contributor to Radical Software, and maker of politically engaged documentaries for public access cable TV. Indeed much of JosehYs ter minology can be traced back to the pages of Radical Software, the think tank of the alterna tive video movement, and Joselit is not alone in emphasizing the central importance of this long-neglected magazine.s Of course, we already know the tragic denouement of this avant-garde story: Shamberg s attempts (with the video collective Top Value Televi sion) to conduct "true cybernetic guerilla warfare" by "re-structuring communications channels" and turning the camera back on the "conventions of network coverage" ended in economic failure (99). After the critical success of its irreverent coverage of the 1972 Democratic and Republican con ventions in Miami, TVTV made documen taries for public television on a free-lance basis. However, its effort at producing the 1977 TVTVShow for network television failed after a brief run on NBC. What is new in Joselit's account is his discussion of Shamberg's next career move, in which he ends up as a successful Hollywood producer of films such as The Big Chill (1983). At this point, Joselit manifests a surprising degree of loyalty to his own eco-formalist method. Rather than assessing the famed video activist's later career as a "moral failure," Joselit assesses Shamberg's new social role as movie producer in purely tactical terms, presenting Shamberg as having merely repositioned himself within the same media ecology in "an effort to address a broader public, albeit with a blander message" (103). Here, Joselit demonstrates a remarkable elasticity in his argumentive approach in order to further his main thesis that any democratization of the medium is insepara ble from its capitalization. Thus it is not a universal notion of civic freedom (realized, for instance, in open-access media) that interests him, but the protean forms of social communities that on the one hand gravitate to certain nodal points of shared identification and on the other hand are sus ceptible to the "commercial interpellations" of television, "which aims to transform its viewers into market segments" (103). Such communities cohere around "media icons" which may or may not pander to or disrupt the interpellative forms of identification that joselit associates with commercial television.6 Joselit's analysis focuses on the con struction and reception of such media icons, or, to be more precise, the dialectic between such iconic images and the televisual "net work." The televisual network functions as the ground of the commodity-image, regu lating its distribution and reception, but the network also functions in Joselit's argument as a principle of boundlessness or formless ness that threatens to dissolve the psychic gestalt of the commodity-image in a pulsat ing reversal of figure and background. This destabilizing, "wave-like" dynamic of the network not only contains the potential to breach television's closed circuits that chan nel the viewer's thoughts and desires, but provides the necessary, formal condition for alternative formations of collective identity to burst unexpectedly to the surface of the mediascape. If not explicitly stated in this manner in Joselit's text, two different topologies of the network are at play here, namely, a central ized and a distributed diagram of the net work. Indeed, a historical transition between a centralized and a distributed organization of the media public sphere is enacted in the media practices that Joselit studies. And in the course of events, new forms of power on the apparatical level of the distributed sys tem would emerge: the "disciplinary" tech niques of a panoptic society make way for the protocological systems of a "control society."7 But the dialectic of network versus commodity that Joselit outlines is not always clear about the precise subjectifying effects of such networks; that is to say, about the topological differences between various historical networks and their material processes of modulating selves and bodies. Joselit reads this dialectic of network versus commodity in terms of a mutual destabiliza tion of figure (the commodity-form) and ground (the closed circuit of television). For instance, he writes about the "dancing patterns" of Nam June Paik's "prepared" television sets as a representation of the non containable "mobility of the network" (7), but I would like to stress that this is, at best, a mere representation. Such a corrosion of the electronic code of televisual images hardly shakes the form of the commodity to its core, since it is already infected with what Walter Benjamin termed "the universal equality of things." Hence, such a meta phorical approach to the question of the network, which privileges notions of "process" or "mobility" versus "presence" or "stability" deserves to be tempered by a properly apparatical mode of analysis, which is informed by recent discussions of the biopolitical organization of human rela tions within information society8 The third objective of Feedback clarifies that it is not the signifying unity of the artwork that should form the focus of art historical analysis, but the "trajectories" of image-events within the media ecology Since this media ecology can be entered from different sites, whether the gallery or the television broadcast station, there is no sense in distinguishing between artistic practices (e.g., Paik's electronic painting) or activist practices (e.g., Shamberg's guerilla television). Irrespective of their artistic or political motivation, it is the formal nature of these media interventions that must be diag I 16 SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="3">nosed (37). What must be evaluated is the efficacy of these practices to "produce aber rant or Utopian pathways across the locked down terrain of television" (41 ). Thus Joselit adopts a very welcome distance from conventional histories of video art that are constructed around the notion of an autonomous discipline, despite the overt resistance to professionalization exerted by its earliest practitioners. Furthermore, Joselit does not distinguish between the usual heroes and villains in such historical narra tives, which place the "formalists," such as Paik, on the one side, and the "documentar ians," such as Martha Rosier, on the other side. The eco-formalist framework of Joselit makes such distinctions largely irrelevant. Paik, for example, is cast as both a formal inventor, one who "proliferates" images, and a media interventionist, one who "diversifies" images. Besides these three objectives, Joselit identifies three specific tactics of media intervention. In the first place, the epony mous tactic of feedback "may denote either rational interchange or destabilizing feed back noise." Second, he describes the viral as a "parasitic and catastrophic mode of image circulation that can invade and transform systems." And finally, the avatar is defined as "a prosthetic icon available to anyone, regardless of their nominal identity" (xiii). As mentioned before, it is the form and not the material technique as such that interests Joselit. Thus, to provide but one example, his discussion of feedback ranges between a classical example of video installation, namely Frank Gillette and Ira Schneider's 1969 closed-circuit installation Wipe Cycle, which mixed live and recorded signals in order "both to represent and to pluralize the monolithic information of network TV through a spectator's unexpected encounter with her or his own act of viewing" (93) and an equally canonical example of blax ploitation film, namely Melvin Van Peebles's Sweet Sweetback s Baadasssss Song ( 1971 ), which is celebrated for constructing a new outlaw image that allowed a disenfranchised black community to "flash into being through feedback," if only for a moment (131). From this example it also becomes clear that Joselit is not so much interested in the specific, technical usages of feedback within different social or artistic communities or the various theoretical ramifications of the term. Rather, he is more concerned with what images and objects do, than with what they mean. Joselit does not offer a thick description of events. Dan Graham's time delay video installations of the mid- 1970s, for instance, are briefly introduced because they "diagram the constitution of communi ties from the feedback loop of television," while foregrounding the underlying proce dures of (dis) identification (105). By extrap olating such a diagrammatic model of feed back across the media spectrum, Joselit follows a genealogical method, tracing the mutations and transformations of a specific tactic such as feedback. Thus, between his discussions of Shamberg and Van Peebles, Joselit contrasts the cases of Hoffman, who deployed celebrity status for insurgent goals by making "advertisements for revolution," and Andy Warhols Exploding Plastic Inevitable, which is said to deconstruct the mechanisms of celebrity culture by employing multi sensorial forms of feedback in a direct assault on the psychic unity of the subject. Although Joselit clearly demonstrates his preference for the examples set by EPI and Van Peebles, this is no teleological narrative, but a fully open-ended one: "Guerilla action should not be evaluated in terms of permanency" (131). In the previous examples, the formalist basis of Joselit's critical method shines through with great force?and Joselit does much to disprove that formalism can be equated with an apolitical perspective. The author consistently phrases his argument in the binary terms of figure versus ground. Whereas Hoffman stands out as a figure of dissent against the ground of celebrity cul ture, EPI is considered to be more radical in its refusal of the very logic of figure versus ground, opting instead to induce a subjec tive state of formlessness in its audience.9 Although the topological structure of feed back would seem to militate against the use of such a projective geometry of figure ver sus ground, Feedback abounds in such termi nology. It is not any stable relationship of figure to ground that Joselit's roving gaze is attuned to, but a "scrambling of figure and ground" that exhibits "an infection of gestalt relationships whose symptom is feedback noise" (60).Take, for instance, his discussion of Paik's collaboration with the cellist Charlotte Moorman, whose body is clad with television monitors and becomes thereby "a ground for an infinite regress of images" (60). Moorman is served up as an example of "viral aesthetics" (the term derives from William Burroughs) where the body becomes "infected" by media as a kind of protocyborg (60). This concept of viral aesthetics, which has been expounded before by Katherine Hay les, is a productive one since it brings an informational model of life-as-code into focus, one that fundamentally differs from modernist conceptions of object-subject relations.10 Thus Joselit's subsequent discus sion of acid subcultures runs into the utter paradox that the pursuit of a liberated or expanded consciousness cannot disentangle itself from the very processes of media feed back. Despite the desire of the acid subcul ture to drop out and quit the circuits of Media-America, there is no collective mode of existence possible beyond mediality. Joselit clearly shows this internal limit of the countercultural movements of the 1960s, which never ceased to look, as it were, in the mirror of the media. But one could already counter to his earlier reading of Moorman's performance that the placement of the tele vision monitors on her body acts to ground rather than proliferate the "infinite regress" of the media. Without doubt the ecological paradigm could also serve a Utopian pro gram of technological naturalization during the 1960s (one only has to think of Marshall 117 art journal</page><page sequence="4">McLuhan), which raises certain troubling questions in relation to Paik concerning the ecological as an anthropomorphic trope of equilibrium between people and the (media) environment." However, Joselit passes over such problems, preferring instead to wed the ecological to the viral, while claiming that "the purpose of viral aesthetics is to interrupt the smooth reproduction of pattern in order to induce shake, quiver, or noise. The objective of an art history devoted to scanning is to stabilize such evanescent moments in order to mine their significance, as both politics and form" (63). One such rich seam of viral aesthetics is formed by Paik's prepared television sets, which convert the electronic circuitry of the monitors into a fertile matrix for the proliferation and diversification of images, produced at will by the spectator who is transformed into a participant. In this fash ion, Paik is given credit as the inventor of the artwork as a "catalyst" that can affect an entire image ecology. His "dancing pat terns," Joselit argues, were to move from the screen into the world "in a heroic if doomed attempt to obliterate not just individual objects but the entirety of American con sumer culture" (63). Joselit thus proposes the possibility of a homological relationship between artistic form and social forms that is grounded on the elementary dialectic of commodity versus network that runs throughout the book. This concept of homology deserves fur ther comment, but first it should be noted that, following Paik's example, the art histo rian is asked to aspire to a similar degree of critical agency, that is, to participate or inter vene within the realm of representations. It is clear where the sources of Joselit's methodological approach reside: they can be located in former debates concerning repre sentation theory and identity politics. Thus we are admonished to value pictures not "for what they mean" (including what his torical conditions they may "reflect") but for "what they do" (69).l2 Joselit's nemesis, therefore, is a poststructuralist technique of "subversion," despite his frequent citation of such notions as "groundlessness" or "distributed subjectivity"13 He identifies the tactic of subversion, perhaps all too quickly, with a one-dimensional notion of the ready made, which has led, he complains, to end less and rather futile demonstrations of the "commodity-Status of art." In contrast to such a conventional reading of the ready made, Joselit poses a trajective notion of the readymade, one in which the commod ity dissolves into the network, the object into randomized code, the image into elec tronic static. This argument still leaves me with a question concerning the manner in which Joselit allows morphological similarities to migrate between artworks and social struc tures as, for instance, in the parallel he makes between Paik's "dancing patterns" and the psychedelic "free-style" experiments with the communal forms of life. There seems to be a more abrupt difference between Paik's experiments with the image on the television screen and the psychedelic refashioning of life that is described so well by Joselit. To be sure, some of the most fasci nating parts of Joselit's book are concerned with explicating the underlying tensions between mediated and unmediated forms of experience in the psychedelic countercul ture: the dilemma of wanting to exist in the moment, while also desiring to watch one self and others in the process of "being in the now" (77). Hence, when the Merry Pranksters went on a road trip in 1964, Joselit writes, they were in fact aware of liv ing a road movie, which demanded to be filmed. Of course, this phenomenological ambivalence could not be resolved and the film was never completed, but this split condition between lived and mediated expe rience is not dissimilar to the apparatical structure of television itself, as Samuel Weber has theorized,I4 since television does not overcome distance and separation, but scrambles relations of proximity and dis tance. Television covers up a gap; it decon structs presentness by being both here and there at the same time. And so I return once more to my earlier comment. If I have one disagreement with this book, which otherwise forms a major contribution to the development of a new media-art history, it would be that in open ing up art-historical scholarship to the vast weave of image ecologies, the eco-formalist method that is developed in Feedback tends to come at the cost of the apparatical mode of analysis that was promised at the outset.15 Nevertheless, I can state without further reservation that Feedback deserves widespread readership among both art historians and media scholars. Lacking neither critical ambition nor polemical acumen, Feedback shows an authoritative command of its wide ranging subject matter. Written in a highly articulate and lucid style, Feedback makes not only for a very good read, but also a pro found contribution to rethinking the future of art history in our networked age. 1. Joselit prefers to leave the art history versus visual culture debate behind him, arguing instead that "visual culture often amounts to little more than the art history of commercial art" (3 I ). Feedback, he maintains, does not depart from distinctions between cultural practices based on "established material substrates" (i.e., mediums) but moves toward "the mapping of an uneven spectrum of cultural and capital investments made across an ecology of interrelated forms (which may encompass television, video art, and the media appropriations of political activists)" (34, italics in orig.). 2.

Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Public Sphere and Experience: Toward an Analysis of the Bourgeois and Proletarian Public Sphere, trans. Peter Labanyi, Jamie Owen Daniel, and Assenka Oksiloff (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993). While Joselit yields a binary model of dominant versus oppositional publics, Negt and Kluge's model is more nuanced. They describe three levels of publicity. On the one hand, there is a primary collusion between the media industry and the disintegrating bourgeois public sphere for the sake of the cultural legitimation of the former. Together, these two public spheres constitute the dominant form of publicity. Yet, at the same time dominant publicity depends on the appropriation and valorization of popular experience in order to provide the mass-media spectacle with "expe riential substance," as Miriam Hansen writes in her insightful essay that accompanies the English translation of Negt and Kluge's book. Whereas the life context of such disenfranchised and sub ordinate groups looks fragmentary from the viewpoint of dominant publicity, from the reverse perspective dominant publicity will appear to provide only ?nadthentic forms of representation. Yet dominant publicity does not only have this degrading effect, but produces new conditions for resistance with the "potential for instability, for accidental collisions and opportunities, for unpredictable conjunctures and aleatory develop ments?conditions under which alternative formations, collective interests, may gain a momentum of their own" (xl). 4.

Chapter 4 uses the notion of the "avatar" to offset the interpellative operations of commercial television?"to train Americans to maintain their proper places"?with a series of counterpractices by, among others, Bruce Nauman, Vito Acconci, and Joan Jonas. This part of the book stages encounters between images and subjects in order to "represent identity as a process, not a televisual presence" (163, italics in orig.). 7.

On this problem, I recommend Alexander Galloway's excellent Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2004). 9. Joselit's argument owes much to the brilliant reading of the EPI by Branden Joseph, "My Mind Split Open: Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable," Grey Room 8 (Summer 2002): 80-107. 10. N. Katherine Hayles, How We Became Post human: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999). I I. In view of the current popularity of the term "media ecology," it becomes all the more urgent to develop a critical genealogy of various ecologi cal models of the media. It is, in my opinion, no innocent term and was already subject to criticism by the end of the 1950s in the context, for instance, of the Situationist International. 12. Thus T. J. Clark's Farewell to an Idea (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999) finds approval since it describes a "revolution of the sign" (and not a "semiotic interrogation of the medium") that responds to a "politically induced crisis within a society's representational systems" (70). 13. Even though subversion functions as a fre quent target of ridicule in Feedback, ?t is not always completely clear what Joselit means. At the bottom of page 30 he appears to identify sub version with the false presumption of attaining a critical position "outside capitalism," but such a position is hardly that of a deconstructive method. On page 40 Joselit names "the modernist tactic of revolution" and "the poststructuralist technique of subversion" as "two sides of the same coin." We can agree that a deconstructive model of subversion from within has become highly prob lematic today, but Joselit's dismissive gesture is made too quickly and with little care for detail. 14. Samuel Weber, "Television: Set and Screen," in Mass Mediauras: Forms, Technics, Media (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1996), 108-28. Joselit cites Weber in his notes but does not develop Weber's argument, which after all is a version of the poststructuralist tactic of subversion. 15. Here I have something else in mind than those "media-art histories" that are constructed along technological time-lines, tracing back the origins of, say, immersive mediato nineteenth-century panoramas.
