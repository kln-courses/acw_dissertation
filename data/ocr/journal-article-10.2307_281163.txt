Myers (University of Nebraska State Museum) expects to go to Iquitos in August- September to begin work on a long-term project to examine the carrying capacity of the upper Amazon. He will begin by locating sites in the San Joaquin de los Omaguas area, and will then work backwards and forwards to determine changes in settlement pattern, site size, and complexity. GUYANA. Peter Siegel (Centro de Investigaciones Indigenas de Puerto Rico. Inc.) has been studying the architectural and demographic organization of a Wai- wai community, located in the tropical forest of south- ern Guyana. The distribution of architectural space is analyzed across the village by both family and house- hold group. Plotting floor areas of various structure types against number of people at the family level yields relatively low correlation coefficients. In contrast, the same set of relations considered at the household level generates very high correlation coefficients. These find- ings make sense in light of traditional, pre-missionary- period Waiwai lifeways. In other words, the household is the adaptive, functioning unit in this society, and as such, spatial requirements are dictated along house- hold lines. Once this is understood, the household be- comes the analytical unit, which makes cultural (or emic) sense. In terms of prehistoric archaeology in the South American tropical lowlands, we now have a basis for realistically retrodicting household size for a given settlement type. the sedentary community. BRAZIL. Para. Anna Roosevelt (Anthropology Departments, American Museum of Natural History and New York University) has received funding from NSF (BNS-8712180) and NEH (RO-21464) to contin- ue the Lower Amazon Archaeological Project. Field- work will take place from mid-July to mid-December. 1987. It will involve geophysical survey and strati- graphic excavations on Marajo Island and at Santarem, Para State. Brazil. The research team of 30 includes Bruce Bevan (Geosight), David Greene (University of Colorado), Silvia Maranca (Museu Paulista), William Sauk (Universidade Federal do Paria) Christina Mi- randa (Universidade Federal do Matto Grosso and Hunter College), Robert Meade (USGS), Gordon Ja- coby and Dorothy Peteet (Lamont Geological Obser- vatory, Columbia University), Maria Ivaneide da Silva (Museu Goeldi), and others. Primary collaborating in- stitutions are the American Museum of Natural His- tory. Museu Goeldi, and the Museu Paulista. Students from Hunter College. New York University, Indiana 178</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH University, the University of Pennsylvania, the Uni- versidade Federal do Para, and the Universidade Fede- ral do Rio de Janeiro will take part in the fieldwork. Rupert Housley of the Oxford University Accelerator Laboratory is collaborating on the dating program, and Elizabeth Wing of the University of Florida at Gaines- ville is collaborating on faunal analysis. The Santarem work will focus on two multicom- ponent sites: Santarem City, the presumed capital of the contact-period Tapaj6s chiefdom, and Taperinha, a large shellmound approximately 30 km downriver from Santarem. The purpose of the work is to verify a developmental sequence for the region. Roosevelt's NEA ( 1981-1985) study of the archives and collections from the work of Charles Hartt and others during the 1860s and 1870s suggests the existence of a long, com- plex cultural sequence comprising several successive phases-an initial ceramic phase, and five successive phases of decorated ceramics. Radiocarbon dates on shell from Hartt's Harvard collection (Geochron Labs) and on plant materials in lake cores from the region suggest that the shell-mound occupation begins at least by 10,000 B.P., with pottery appearing ca. 6000 B.P. Fieldworkers plan to map the sites geophysically and sample the stratigraphy for artifacts, plant remains, faunal remains, and samples for dating. The Marajo work is focused on the mound-building Marajoara phase (ca. 700-1600 B.P.) at the mouth of the Amazon. The coming season will involve geo- physical survey and stratigraphic excavations of two sites on the Goiapi River in east-central Marajo. These are Teso dos Bichos, a mound 7 m high covering an area of 3 ha, and Fortaleza, a multimound habitation and cemetery center with an area of ca. 10 km2, in- vestigated by William Farabee early in this century. Five geophysical surveys and 33 excavations at Teso dos Bichos uncovered a series of superimposed house ruins, earthworks, and refuse deposits rich in plant and animal remains. Project workers mapped and sampled a Pacoval phase (ca. 1000-1200 B.P.) settlement of 20 contemporary multifamily houses and hearth groups surrounded by a monumental earthen wall. The pur- pose of the next season's Marajo work is to excavate architectural features, earthworks, and garbage depos- its at Teso dos Bichos and to map and test excavate cemeteries at Fortaleza to plan for future work. Mato Grosso. Archaeologist Irmhild Wust (Museu Antropologico da Universidade Federal de Goias) and ethnologist Renate B. Viertler (Universidade de Sao Paulo) continued work on their project in the Sao Lou- renco Basin. During July and August 1986, they con- tinued archaeological work on the Vermelho River, a tributary of the Sao Lourenco. The project has been financed by FAPES (Fundacao de Amparo Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo). Thirty-two new sites were investigated. Sites con- sisted of caves with low-relief petroglyphs, open-air lithic sites, Uru tradition ceramic sites, Tupiguarani painted subtradition sites, and ancient Bororo villages. The cultural sequence for the area extends from the earliest lithic sites of the Paranaiba phase, ca. 11,000 B.P., to the precolonial occupation of the area. Prior to this work radiocarbon dates for the earlier occu- pations had not been obtained. Dates have now been furnished by the Radioisotopic Association of Japan. The lowest preceramic levels of several caves with petroglyphs have been dated: The 35 cm level of Ta- pera cave dates 3470 ? 75 B.P. (N-5117). The 35 cm level of Dipetrol cave dates 2110 ? 65 B.P. (N-5116). The 30 cm level of Morro do Jarudore cave dates 2560 + 800 B.P. (N-5 112). The 40 cm level of Morro do Janela cave dates 1090 ? 75 B.P. Geometric-style petroglyphs predominate at Tapera and Dipetrol caves, while Morro do Jarudore and Morro do Janela caves contain both geometric- and anthropomorphic-style petroglyphs. Most of the low-relief geometric designs resemble those of the Pisadas style and can be attrib- uted to this older time period. Morro da Janela also was associated with a lithic tradition in which ceramic fragments of the Uru tradition were found. Lote da Sobra, an open air site with a depth of 35 cm, was dated at 1150 ? 65 B.P. (N-5114) and is associated with ceramics of the Uru tradition. The lowest level (40 cm) of another ceramic site, Pobore Raireu, shows the simultaneous occurrence of the Uru and Tupi- guarani painted subtraditions, and dates 1090 ? 60 B.P. (N-5113). These dates and other data on the morphology of the sites, spacial distribution, relative position, and nature of refuse permit the tracing of the first sequence for the later part of the precolonial occupations of the area. The most recent preceramic occupation (3500- 1790 B.P.) can be attributed to the hunting and col- lecting groups whose technological tradition is char- acterized by unifacial flake tools that occasionally show secondary retouch. Cutting, scraping, perforating, and polishing tools were included. The primary materials used for tool manufacture were chalcedony pebbles and a consolidated sandstone (quartzite). The pebbles were broken and flaked by percussion. Tools from the oldest sites show signs of having been made with soft-per- cussion techniques, while later sites show greater use of hard percussion. The transition to agriculture occurred about 1800 B.P. and is attested to by open lithic sites with some Uru ceramic fragments. There is a continuation of the lithic tradition after the increase of small bifacial im- plements, ax blades, and polishing stones. About 1100 B.P. a ceramic-using agricultural group was established in large circular villages. The ceramics strongly resem- ble those of the Uru tradition and appear to mark the transition to manioc production, as indicated by the presence of large griddles and jars. Ceramic-tradition sites are located in forested areas as well as along the large rivers. The differential spacial/geographical oc- cupation does not appear to have temporal or ecolog- ical connotations, but rather is aimed at a defense- oriented strategy against canoe-using groups, such as the carriers of the Tupiguarani tradition who appear to have arrived about 1100 B.P. The majority of known petroglyphs having anthropomorphic, zoo- morphic, and plant imagery can be attributed to the agricultural groups. At one site a wall relief depicts 56 full-sized human figures adorned with feathered arti- facts and body decoration and carrying rattles in their hands. One Uru tradition ceramic site is situated at the top of a hill that makes access difficult. It is interpreted as a local refuge used during the advance of other indig- enous groups or European colonizers. A sharp break 179</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY in lithic and ceramic traditions occurred between oc- cupation of the area by these agricultural groups and by the ethnographically known Bororo Indians. Dates are pending on sites where ceramics of the Uru and Bororo traditions occur simultaneously. Such dates might illuminate the fusion of the carriers of these two traditions. Ronald L. Weber ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA Archaeological reserach in Andean South America has fallen on hard times. The deepening debt crisis, combined with relatively low prices for traditional ex- ports like metals and sugar, has continued to reduce the funds available for locally financed fieldwork. The drop in oil prices has had a particularly strong impact on Ecuador and has led to cutbacks in government- sponsored research. An El Nifo current, a drought, and an earthquake occurring in rapid succession only have intensified these economic woes. Finally, all of the An- dean countries find themselves buffeted by political difficulties, and while national strikes, coup attempts, and guerilla activity are not new to the region, they clearly are having an impact on foreign research proj- ects. In Peru, the violence by Sendero Luminoso and the opposing military and police forces has led to a sharp decline in the number of new projects begun in the highlands. The large-scale robbery of equipment from several projects in Peru last year is still another indi- cator of the increasingly difficult situation. The reor- ganization of Peruvian archaeology by the newly elect- ed APRA party, and their decision to strictly enforce the 1985 archaeological regulations summarized by Tom Lynch in this column last year, produced an un- precedented situation in which more foreign and na- tional projects were waiting for their permits than were working. The INC now is recommending that foreign investigators leave plenty of lead time (6 months) to be certain of avoiding delays. While some are heeding this advice, others are devoting their time to analysis and writing rather than to field investigations. Despite these problems, a substantial amount of ex- citing research continues. As the incoming assistant editor in charge of Andean South America, I would like to provide a comprehensive coverage of all of the current research in my region. However, I only can report on the work of those colleagues who keep me informed of their research by writing before May 15 (Latin American time). Those who do not do this will be neglected, but as the saying goes, "Guerra avisada no mata gente." Finally, the respected German Andeanist, Udo Obe- rem, recently died at the age of 62. Oberem probably is best known for his excavations of the monumental architecture at Cochasqui, Ecuador, but during his long career he carried out ethnographic and archaeological research in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The Ecuador- ian government recognized his exceptional contribu- tion by awarding him the Orden Nacional at Merito en el Grado de Oficial. ECUADOR. Leon Doyan (Yale University, Banco Central del Ecuador) is completing three years of ex- cavation at the large, multicomponent site of La Flor- ida. Located on the outskirts of modern Quito near the airport, the site mainly pertains to the Regional De- velopmental period; the ceramics are in the incom- pletely defined Chaupi Cruz style of Jij6n y Caamafio. Investigations have focused on the ceremonial sector at the site in which the oldest feature is a large artificial mound (1520 + 80 B.P., 1-14, 635) and the most recent features are a series of shaft and chamber tombs ranging from 12.5 m to 15 m in depth. The shafts are shaped like wine bottles with a 2 m deep central pit at the bottom. Some tombs have domed burial chambers in a parallel shaft. The principal burial in each tomb is accompanied by one or two elite companion burials. The deceased are surrounded with large numbers of marine-shell beads, mostly spondylus, and other sump- tuary goods such as ornaments of gold, copper, and semiprecious and precious stones. Other frequent of- ferings are trophy heads, human corpses, large mam- mals, and household ceramic vessels. Small amounts of wood, basketry, fiber cord, and woven textiles have been preserved. Five shaft tombs will be fully exca- vated and the artificial mound will be trenched before final analysis is begun later this year. Ronald D. Lippi (Banco Central del Ecuador) is con- tinuing his exploration of the western flank of the An- des in Pichincha province, a project first reported in this column last year. In 1985 Lippi completed the first stage of surveying in the region that comprises some 6,000 km2 of rugged, densely vegetated terrain. Well over 200 sites, ranging from Cotocollao phase settle- ments to hilltop fortresses of possible Inca construc- tion, were cataloged during the survey. He found a few long-abandoned protohistoric native settlements by correlating archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence. Several ancient trade routes were traced and actual physical evidence of the road system was encountered. In addition, many newly discovered pyramidal and conical mounds were cataloged. In late 1985 and early 1986, Lippi shifted his attention to a multicomponent, subtropical rain-forest site, Nambillo. This was one of ten sites with Cotocollao occupations cataloged during the survey. The large site consists of three superim- posed paleosols, each of which contains multiple oc- cupations dating from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 1660. Two major hiatuses at the site were due to volcanic activity from the nearby Cordillera Occidental. Extensive soil coring and phosphate testing of the Nambillo site pro- vided very detailed paleotopographic and activity-area maps of the deeply buried site. Test excavations were performed to obtain a stratigraphic sequence of ce- ramics for preliminary chronological studies of the oc- cupations. Future work at the site will involve more extensive phosphate testing and excavations to deter- mine the nature of the human-activity areas already identified through soil chemistry. The Programa de Antropologia para el Ecuador, di- rected by Presley Norton, continues the excavations in Salango on the south coast of Manabi at site OMJPLP 141 B, under the supervision of Richard Lun- niss. Most recently, the Project uncovered a wooden Late Formative (Chorrera or Engoroy) structure built on a clay floor; this building is believed to have had a 180 [Vol. 53, No. 1, 1988]</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH ceremonial rather than a domestic function. The area of excavation has been extended to secure recovery of at least three-quarters of the structure as well as part of the area surrounding it. The wooden structure is covered by a Late Formative/Early Regional Devel- opmental period ceremonial mound and enclosures, the western corners of which already have been exca- vated. A site museum has been constructed in Salango to house the collection of artifacts recovered during the past nine years of survey and excavation. NORTHERN PERU. In 1985, the Japanese Sci- entific Expedition to Nuclear America, directed by Ka- zuo Terada, completed a fourth season in the highlands of Cajamarca. At the site ofHuacaloma, a 525 m2 area was excavated in the southeast portion of mound M- 1. This revealed a three-tiered platform complex dating to the first phase of the Late Huacaloma period, which was enlarged twice before being completely covered by an even larger three-tiered platform dating to the El period. The retaining wall of the lowest E1 platform level is 5 m high, and a gallery-like staircase appears to lead from the base of the platform directly to the summit. The stone staircase measures 1 m in width and 2 m in height and has a corbelled ceiling. Investigations also were carried out by the Japanese Scientific Expedition in the upper Jequetepeque Valley at Cerro Blanco, a small mound 1.5 km from the better- known site of Kuntur Wasi near the modern town of San Pablo. Small-scale excavations established a three- phase sequence beginning with the La Conga period (3390 ? 80 B.P.), believed to be equivalent to the Early Huacaloma period, followed by the Cerro Blanco pe- riod (2990 ? 80 B.P., 2750 ? 60 B.P.), probably coeval with Late Huacaloma, and concluding with the Sotera period, which is characterized by materials similar to those of both the E 1 and Layz6n periods. A deep shaft tomb discovered at Cerro Blanco included seven pot- tery vessels as well as necklaces, pendants, and pec- torals made from lapiz lazuli, turquoise, and spondylus shell. One of the ceramic offerings is a Cupisnique- style stirrup-spouted bottle with incised feline motifs. Carbon from the floor of the tomb yielded a measure- ment of 3270 + 70 B.P. Jeffrey Quilter (Ripon College) has begun the anal- ysis at the American Museum of Natural History of the Cupisnique ceramics excavated by Junius Bird at Huaca Prieta in the Chicama Valley. Heidy Fogel (Yale University) has completed a reanalysis of Gallinazo ceramics from selected excavations by Wendell Ben- nett in the Viru Valley. The resulting three-phase rel- ative sequence utilizes vessel form and other attributes rather than the typological approach employed by the Viru Valley Project. The proposed sequence currently is being tested and refined by seriating Gallinazo grave- lots conserved in the American Museum of Natural History and at the Yale Peabody Museum. CENTRAL PERU. In 1986, the Upper Mantaro Archaeological Research Project focused attention on the prehistoric development of the Wanka ethnic group. Christine Hastorf (University of Minnesota) directed excavations at Pancan, a small village site located at 3,480 m above sea level on the shore of a lake. The four occupation levels there appear to span the Early Intermediate period through the Late Intermediate pe- riod. Organic material found within the adobe struc- tures uncovered at Pancan were unusually well pre- served. Complementary surface survey directed by Timothy Earle (UCLA) has located over 134 sites and changes in the settlement patterns for this same period of time now can be documented. Herbert Wright (Uni- versity of Minnesota) is studying paleoclimatic con- ditions in the Mantaro drainage. He has carried out pollen coring in, and geomorphological reconnaissance around, the lake next to Pancan, and has sampled peat located near the glaciers in the mountain ranges to the east and west of the Mantaro Valley. Terry D'Altroy (Columbia University) continues to study variability in the style and function of Inca ceramics from the Mantaro Valley and Lynn Sikkink (University of Min- nesota) conducted ethnoarchaeological research on household activities and refuse accumulation. Elizabeth Bonnier and Catherine Rozenberg (French Institute of Andean Studies) have continued their in- vestigations at the ruins of Piruru (3,800 m above sea level) in Tantamayo on the eastern slopes of Huanuco. Recent excavations have focused on an early occupa- tion that includes a ceremonial construction with a central fire pit similar to those uncovered at Kotosh, Huaricoto, and Galgada; stratigraphic evidence and radiocarbon measurements indicate that the Piruru rit- ual construction dates to the end of the Preceramic period. Lisa Valkanier (University of California-Berkeley) conducted a preliminary reconnaissance of Chimu Ca- pac in the Supe Valley in preparation for an extended investigation of the Middle Horizon occupation there. Similarly, Jorge Silva (University of San Marcos, Uni- versity of Michigan) has conducted a preliminary survey of the lower and middle Chill6n Valley in prep- aration for an intensive, systematic survey of an 80- kilometer strip from Playa Marquez at the mouth of the Chill6n River to Canta (3,800 m above sea level). The first season of fieldwork at Cardal in the Lurin Valley was carried out in 1985 under the direction of Richard L. Burger (Yale University) and Lucy Salazar- Burger. Cardal is a late Initial period site (1150-800 B.C.) best known for its U-shaped monumental ar- chitecture and sunken circular features. Excavations were undertaken in the open area between the main pyramid and the western wing in order to test the Wil- liams hypothesis of agro-religious centers. A north- south trench across this area failed to encounter evi- dence of the canal system envisioned by Williams. In- stead, a layer of dense refuse rich in anchovies and mollusks was encountered. The excavations uncovered a low, stone-lined causeway nearby, leading into the vast central sector. An east-west trench intersected the open central area and revealed that a raised plaza had been constructed with a thick stone fill brought from the rocky ridges adjacent to Cardal. The hard, unbro- ken floor covering the plaza area and the stone fill below it would have been inappropriate for the ceremonial fields and orchards hypothesized by Williams. Addi- tional excavations were conducted at four of the small sunken circular plazas. These features were built of coarse masonry which was plastered and painted. A T-shaped fire pit was found in the center of one plaza. Polychrome friezes were discovered on the summit of 181</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the central pyramid. To the south of the U-shaped architecture is an area covered by small rustic struc- tures, burials, and dense refuse. This sector is hypoth- esized to be a residential area coeval with the monu- mental architecture. The five-year University of Michigan field project, "Archaeology and Ethnohistory of Cerro Azul, Canete Valley" (codirected by Joyce Marcus and Maria Rost- worowski), has ended, and analyses are underway by project members Ramiro Matos (archaeology), James Stoltman (ceramic thin sections), C. Earle Smith, Jr. (flora), Kent V. Flannery (fauna), Dwight Wallace (tex- tiles), Martha Tate and Max Saltzman (fiber and dyes), Charles Hastings (cartography), and John Jones (cop- rolites). Excavations produced abundant Late Inter- mediate period evidence for occupational specializa- tion and for such activities as fishing, shellfish collecting, hunting, weaving, and chicha making. The German Archaeological Institute Project in the Topara Valley continued in 1985 and 1986 under the direction of Wolfgang Wurster. A major discovery of the 1985 field season was the existence of several for- tresses located in the upper Topara Valley, some 80 km from the coast at 3,000-3,400 m above sea level. One of these forts, near the modern village of Chavin, is located on a ridge and consists of a series of irreg- ularly shaped patios surrounded by rectangular build- ings of rough stone. A rectangular tomb containing multiple burials was excavated within the perimeter of the site. The project also mapped a large habitation site, Vindusa (T43), in the middle portion of the valley (500 m above sea level) which consists of rectangular buildings of pirka masonry surrounded by a massive defensive wall. In 1986, a circular, vaulted tomb cham- ber was excavated at the site of Conde (site 47) in mid- valley. The tomb was located within a larger flat-roofed rectangular architectural complex whose floors and in- terior walls were covered with white kaolin paint. A complete burial of a young llama was discovered un- derneath the floor of the interior entrance. Though the burial had been looted, reexcavation produced a finely carved miniature human figurine of blue nephritic stone similar in size and workmanship to the Middle Hori- zon figurines from Pikillaqta; ceramics, spondylus, metal, bone, and stone artifacts also were recovered. Though the figurine shows Huari-related features, the painted ceramics recovered are in the style character- istic of the early Late Intermediate period in Chincha and Ica. The osteological material recovered by the Topara Project and the Cerro Azul Project currently is under study by Sonia Guillen (Museo de Ciencias de la Salud). In 1987, David Browne (Royal Commission on An- cient Monuments in Wales) and Jose Baraybar (Uni- versity of San Marcos) conducted a preliminary ar- chaeological survey of the Rio Palpa between the Hacienda Buena Vista and Chichi Tara. Browne en- countered a series of extensive Late Intermediate pe- riod settlements, some far from the valley floor. These late prehistoric sites consisted mainly of platform com- plexes and occupied the sides and floors of canyons and the steep slopes overlooking the upper reaches of the quebradas. In contrast, Early Horizon and Nasca ceramics mainly were recovered from small and me- dium sized settlements and cemeteries located on the slopes and the terrace immediately above the valley floor. Katharina Shreiber (University of California, Santa Barbara) continued her study of the anomalous pukios of the Nasca drainage that are used to tap the under- ground water supply in particularly arid zones. These pukios are unique in Peru and their closest analogues are in the Near East. Pukios still in use were mapped and their construction was studied. Archaeological sur- vey adjacent to and upstream from the pukios on the north side of the Nasca/Aja Valley located seventeen habitation sites. The settlements adjacent to the pukio zone do not date before Nasca 5 and it is hypothesized that the area may have become occupied at that time because the pukios were built. Older sites were found upstream from the pukios but they were near sources of surface water. Patrick Carmichael (University of Calgary) has stud- ied 155 previously unpublished Nasca grave lots col- lected by William Farabee, Alfred Kroeber, and Wil- liam Duncan Strong. These materials will be compared with 120 published Nasca grave lots in order to elu- cidate the relative social status of the deceased indi- viduals and the nature of social hierarchies in Nasca society. SOUTHERN PERU. In response to reports of looting, the INC named a commission which included Federico Kauffmann Doig and Hermilio Rosas to study the site of Chucu in the province of Condesuyos, Are- quipa. Chucu (3,200 m above sea level) is a religious center where hundreds of plaques painted with elab- orate iconography were deposited in natural crevices in the rocky terrain. Kaufmann, in conjunction with the Centro Studi Ricerche Ligabue and in collaboration of Elroy Linares Malaga, discovered an undisturbed chamber in which dozens of well-preserved plaques had been placed. The quadrangular and trapezoidal plaques vary in size from 4 x 5 cm to 30 x 40 cm and are made by painting boulder fragments with red, white, green, and irridescent gray fugitive pigments. The painted figures include conventionalized repre- sentations of people and animals as well as more ab- stract forms such as concentric rectangles. In their sim- plicity. the motifs are reminiscent of cave art, but a small number of associated pottery fragments in the Chuquibamba style suggest a provisional dating of late Middle Horizon/Late Intermediate period. Similar stone plaques have been found at neighboring sites like Itaj, though fewer in number than at Chucu. Brian Bauer (University of Chicago) has been con- ducting an archaeological survey of the northeastern portion of the Paruro province, Cuzco, since 1984. The purpose of his study is to examine the sociopolitical structure of this area in pre-Inca and Inca times. Bauer has identified 450 sites spanning all known periods of ceramic production in Cuzco in the 650 km2 area be- tween Huanacauri and Accha. Last year a large Inca site, Maukallaqta, was mapped and test pitted. During 1986, Susan Niles (Lafayette College) con- tinued her study of Inca royal estates in the Vilcanota- Urubamba Valley, focusing on the area between Calca and Urubamba. Further downstream, Wilbert San Ro- man (INC) directed the mapping and test excavations at the site of Sayaqmarca in 1984. He concludes that [Vol. 53, No. 1, 1988] 182</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH the construction was never completed and that the site was not permanently inhabited. San Roman currently is excavating and consolidating the colcas in the south- eastern sector of Machu Picchu. Vincent Lee (Institute of Andean Studies) conducted his third field trip to the Vilcabamba and Consevidayoc rivers to complete the preparation of maps of Vitcos (Rosas Pata), Vilcabam- ba Viejo (Espiritu Pampa), Incahuasi, and ten other Inca sites in the Vilcabamba region. In 1985 the Cusichaca Project, directed by Ann Ken- dall, continued excavations at the Huilca Raccay fort under the supervision of Gil Hey. The work unearthed pre-Inca burials, refuse and fill and exposed Early Ho- rizon features cutting into the bedrock. A nearby site (Q22), investigated by Nick Appleton, may have been the focus of an early community dating to the late Middle Horizon or earlier. At Q22 a series of wide zig- zagging walls define a formal patio area. Other exca- vations supervised by Paul Wilkinson were carried out in two sectors of the Inca town of Patallacta in order to acquire evidence on building function. A trench in Patallacta encountered a wall fragment above bedrock that was constructed in the same style as the walls at Q22. A Middle Horizon component at Patallacta is now hypothesized on the basis of this architectural feature and an associated pottery fragment. The Cus- ichaca Project also surveyed and conducted test ex- cavations at Cunucayoc, Yanacocha, Rodachayoc, and at two other sites above Huillca Raccay in the Upper Huallancay drainage. Most of these sites appear to have been built during the Late Intermediate period but con- tinued to be occupied during the Late Horizon. Clark Ericson (University of Illinois, Urbana) has been investigating the techmical and social aspects of prehistoric raised fields in Puno and their potential use as an alternative on the altiplano to introduced agri- cultural technologies. Ericson and Ignacio Garay- cochea (Universidad Nacional del Altiplano, Puno) have demonstrated the feasibility of bringing prehistoric raised fields back into production. Approximately 10 ha of abandoned terraces have been rehabilitated. These raised fields produced potato yields of between 8-16 metric tons/ha without fertilizer compared to average local yields of 3-4 tons/ha. Some rehabilitated raised fields have been in continuous production for six years without a significant decline in production. Experi- mental studies over the past six years also demonstrat- ed that raised fields substantially reduce risks from frost, severe drought (e.g., 1982-1983) and massive flooding, such as the 1985-1986 floods which de- stroyed the crops in nonraised fields. A study of the Moquequa-Osmore drainage of the far south coast of Peru by Mark Aldenderfer (North- western University [NU]) and other members of the NU Archaic Project has focused on the Preceramic settlement systems. In collaboration with the Programa Contisuyu, they have discovered over 100 sites in this drainage spanning the entire Preceramic period. Two distinctive settlement patterns have been found on the littoral: one focused on small spring-fed valley systems north of the mouth of the Osmore, and one associated with a long, wide beach and lomas vegetation to the south of the Osmore. In the north, the stratified site of Carizal was located on an intermittent spring, and a radiocarbon measurement of 4390 ? 110 B.P. (Beta- 18920) was obtained on samples from the midpoint of the archaeological deposit. Numerous smaller Prece- ramic period sites are located throughout the Quebrada Carizal. In contrast, the settlement pattern south of the Osmore is characterized by small shell middens dotting the Pampa del Palo beach, including the Shell Ring site, which according to Robert Feldman (Field Mu- seum) has a sequence of radiocarbon measurements ranging from 7665 to 10,595 B.P. Some littoral sites have been buried by colluviation from the coastal hills and are found up to 4 m below the present ground level. A carbon sample taken from a midden 3 m below ground surface has produced a measurement of 3400 + 100 B.P. (Beta-19549). Over 70 open-air Preceramic sites have been located on the terraces of streams in the high sierra (3,000 to 4,000 m above sea level) of the Osmore drainage. Asa- na, located at 3,450 m, is the site of greatest importance in this area because at least 14 cultural strata can be delineated in its 3-m-deep deposit. The last occupation dates to ca. 3000 B.C. and a sample taken from a stratum 2.7 m below the surface produced a date of 8530 ? 240 B.P. (Beta-18924). Four rockshelters with Preceramic deposits also were sampled in this zone. One of these, Coscori, yielded a '4C date of 7610 ? 130 B.P. (Beta- 18922). Open-air sites and rockshelters also have been located on the puna (4,000 to 4,600 m above sea level). At Pampa Chichillape, there are at least 50 Preceramic sites probably due to the presence of suitable natural shelters and the large permanent bofedal. One of these rockshelters, Quelcatani, has pro- duced '4C measurements of 7100 ? 130 B.P. and 7250 ? 170 B.P. (Beta-18926, Beta-18927) from the middle of its deposit. In general, the number of sites in the Osmore drainage appears to increase during the Preceramic, as does site size and complexity. A preliminary survey in the vicinity of Ilo conducted in 1986 by Garth Bawden (University of New Mexico) has suggested a long-lasting coastal tradition and the absence of evidence for an altiplano intrusion. Baw- den's work has documented an early ceramic culture in the hills and plains behind the springs that is char- acterized by undecorated, neckless ollas forms. In later times, small specialized fishing settlements appear with pottery similar in decoration to that of the Las Maitas and San Miguel cultures (ca. 800-1200 A.D.) of north- ern Chile. These sites coexist with settlements of the local Chiribaya culture, whose largest sites are found in the lower Ilo Valley. In the upper Ilo Valley, settle- ments exhibit a mixture of Chiribaya and non-Chiri- baya ceramic traits, but the latter bear little resem- blance to the coeval highland pottery. BOLIVIA. Several archaeological surveys current- ly are being carried out in the Department of La Paz by the National Institute of Archaeology of Bolivia (INAR) with the support of the Organization of Amer- ican States. Juan Faldin Arancibia is directing a survey in the northern part of the Department of La Paz which focuses on the Mollo culture. Another survey is being carried out near Lake Titicaca under the direction of Max Portugal Ortiz. The pre-Inca kingdom of Pakasa is the subject of archaeological reconnaissance by Jose Huidobro Bellido in the south of the Department of La Paz. Finally, the post-Tiahuanaco and Inca occu- 183</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY pations are being studied in the Copacabana area by Oswaldo Rivera Sundt. In 1985 and 1986, the Center of Ethnoarchaeological Investigations (CIEA) carried out a general survey of the hydraulic works of the Tiahuanaco and Mollo cul- tures. According to the project director, Jose Huidobro Bellido, the construction of raised fields, terraces, and canals in the Tiahuanaco heartland provided the sur- pluses which later made the expansion of the empire possible. This CIEA project has documented the extent of the Tiahuanaco and Mollo agricultural works in a recent publication. In 1987, the CIEA began work on an archaeological map and inventory of the approxi- mately 30,000 sites registered in Bolivia. In 1986, an intensive archaeological study of the raised fields in the roughly 70 km2 around Tiahuanaco was initiated by an agreement between the National Institute of Archaeology and the University of Illinois. The Wila Jawir Project, directed by Carlos Ponce San- gines (INAR) and Alan Kolata (University of Illinois) seeks to delineate the relation between the agricultural earthworks and the Tiahuanaco culture. The archae- ological studies eventually will be broadened to include experimental studies like those currently being carried out by Ericson and others in Peru. A multidisciplinary team from INAR recently has reinitiated excavations at Tiahuanaco. INAR also has decided that the Bennett Stela will be returned to Tia- huanaco because of the difficulty of conserving it in La Paz. Richard L. Burger SOUTHERN CONE ARGENTINA. Alberto Rex Gonzalez, a leading authority on Argentine and Andean archaeology, was reinstated in 1986 to his former position as Chair of the Division of Archaeology at the Facultad de Cien- cias Naturales y Museo, Universidad Nacional de La Plata (MLP). This took place ten years after Gonzalez's research and teaching positions at MLP were termi- nated by the military authorities. In April of 1987 Gon- zalez retired as professor emeritus. Victor Nunez Regueiro (Universidad Nacional de Tucuman, CONICET) has been appointed Director of the Instituto de Arqueologia in Tucuman. Ada Isabel Barros de Maldonado has been designated Director of the newly created Departamento de Antropologia y Folklore of the Secretaria de Educacion y Cultura of Jujuy Province. Northwest Puna. Under the direction of Carlos As- chero (Instituto Nacional de Antropologia and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas [INA, CONICET]), Lidia Clara Garcia (Instituto de Ciencias Antropologicas, Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires [ICA, CONICET]) has expanded the original excavations of the former investigator and Hugo Yacobaccio at Alero I, Inca Cueva Creek, Jujuy province, continuing her comparative studies on ce- ramic-period settlement of the Puna. Her excavations enlarged the set of indicators that reinforce the assign- ment of the occupation to an Early Ceramic period. Comparison between present food resources of the area and those used during occupation times is another of Garcia's aims. At the same time, she carried out ethno- archaeological field work at Alto de Sapagua, surveying pottery-making techniques, sources of raw material, use of space, interaction, and frontiers. Other research, together with D. Lavallee and M. Julien, of the French Archaeological Mission, began in the Sierra del Aguilar in 1987. Aschero also continues to study the cultural assem- blage from Inca Cueva-4, Humahuaca, Jujuy province. Level 2 yielded the following radiocarbon dates: 10,620 ? 140 B.P. (LP-137); 9900 ? 200 B.P. (AC- 564); 9650 + 110 B.P. (LP-102); and 9230 ? 70 B.P. (CSIC 498). Level 1A is dated at 5200 ? 110 B.P. (AC- 1112). In Level 2, with triangular stemless points- comparable to early points of the Chilean Norte Grande-there are animal hairs resembling those of present-day guanacos, in addition to storage pits and prepared floors. Alicia Fernandez Distel (Centro Argentino de Es- tudios Anthropologicos [CAEA, CONICET]) contin- ues her research in caves at Huachichocana (Jujuy) where cultivation levels date as early as 6050 B.C. Julian Camara Hernandez, leading expert on maize from the Universidad de Buenos Aires, has identified a "flint"-type maize from the deepest level of Leon Huasi I, with an introduction of amylaceous varieties from the second level to the surface. He also found similarities with two present-day maize varieties of the Quebrada de Humahuaca, Pisingallo and Bola, and with other varieties from the high valleys of the Puna. Hugo Yacobaccio is in charge of studies on the ex- ploitation of wild fauna. Southern Puna. Daniel Olivera (INA, MLP, and Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires) heads a project aimed at analysis of cultural process in the area of Antofagasta de la Sierra, Catamarca province, from the hunting and gathering stage to the Formative period. Of about 48 sites surveyed in this little-known area, 12 date to the Formative period. One of these, Casa Chaves Monticulo, shows two occupational stages, the earliest one with an imported ceramic complex from Northern Chile, and the following one with pro- nounced relationships with the Mesothermal valleys of northwest Argentina. Archaeofaunal analyses indi- cate an almost absolute dominance of llama and pos- sibly vicuia, with high selectivity in killing rates, in- dicative of herding activities. There also are indirect evidences of cultivation and collection of plants of this area and from the Mesothermal valleys, which would point to extensive subsistence systems during the For- mative. Despite the presence of numerous projectile points, hunting may have been unimportant. Olivera dates the Formative of the Southern Puna from 550 B.C. to A.D. 850. Maria Mercedes Podesta (ICA) continues research on Preceramic and Formative rock art and tentatively has identified a sequence from Preceramic to late Pre- hispanic times. Her "Plan Antropologico Integral de Catamarca" is integrated with the Aschero and Olivera project. Aschero has expanded the area of preceramic studies in the zone of Quebrada Seca with the excavation of rockshelter QS3. Preceramic occupations there have 184 [Vol. 53, No. 1, 1988]</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH been dated between 8670 ? 350 B.P. (AC-1118) and 4930 ? 100 B.P. (AC- 115) and have produced plant and animal remains which help to identify the site's area of supply and to specify the activity areas of the different levels. Mineral pigments found at varying depths may correlate these levels with the rock paint- ings of neighboring sites QS 1 and QS2. Other sites are open-air workshops and quarries, campsites, and prob- able watchpoints on hillcrests. Podesta, Yacobaccio, Pintar, and Elkin, among others, are collaborating in the project. Yacobaccio has started a long-term research pro- gram on faunal exploitation patterns in the Puna and the Quebrada de Humahuaca. His aim is to study changes from hunting and gathering to pastoral-agri- cultural societies, differentiating hunting from pastoral behavior. The sample includes several sites and the time span embraces 10,800 B.P. to Inca times. This study will emphasize the economic aspects of animal utilization. Observing that the faunal remains from several ar- chaeological sites show severe damage caused by car- nivores, affecting the representation of skeletal parts of animals found at sites, Yacobaccio has started an anal- ysis of bones from fox dens and mountain-lion kill sites. Gnawing patterns and skeletal part representa- tions will be studied in order to accumulate compar- ative evidence to compare with data from archaeolog- ical sites. Thus far, his analyses suggest that a bias in the representation of skeletal parts due to carnivore action (absence of epiphyses, crushing of shafts) dra- matically affect the bone assemblages in hunting and gathering sites. Subandean Region. Beatriz Ventura (CONICET) is excavating a site east of the Zenta Mountains, in the area formed by the valleys of the Querusillal and San Andres rivers, Salta province. The area has connec- tions to the Puna, the Quebrada de Humahuaca, and the western forests of the Subandean Hills. Her site consists of 20 stone-walled units on a spur of a hill overlooking the Querusillal River. Lithic artifacts con- sist of small triangular-stemmed projectile points of obsidian and flint, flakes and micro-flakes, mortars, and one "spade". Pottery is predominantly plain, though some decorated sherds can be compared to the Late Humahuaca ceramics of the Black-on-red Horizon (Tilcara Black-on-red) and to those of a putative east- ern origin (Angosto Chico Incised), while others are comparable to eastern Puna types (Pozuelos with Quartzite) or, looking far in the other direction, to the decorated ceramics of the "Monte" scrublands to the east of the Subandean hills. The Inca in the Northwest. Rodolfo Raffino (MLP, UBA, CONICET) and staff continue active research in the middle section of the Quebrada de Humahuaca, Jujuy province, with a grant from the National Geo- graphic Society. He has targeted a large urban settle- ment, Pucara de la Huerta, for testing sampling strat- egies to measure urban stratification. La Huerta was erected prior to Inca expansion (ca. A.D. 1350) and later occupied by Imperial emissaries, when there was an architectural remodeling and abrupt growth reflect- ed in construction of 680 buildings. After an exhaustive survey of the ruins, Raffino sampled the settlement area, focusing on different types of buildings and open spaces. Architectural and artifactual differences suggest a diversification of functions within the urban area. For instance, an assemblage of buildings in the central section has been considered to be the place where the Incan ruler of La Huerta lived and was buried. Other differences allow us to consider different sections of the site as administrative, residential, or funerary. Veronica Isabel Williams (ICA, CONICET) contin- ues her research on the Incaic Potrero Chaquiago set- tlement (Catamarca province), from a functional view- point aimed at the identification of intrasite activity and inferences on the ethnic and geographic origin of the pottery makers. Williams is working on diagnostic characteristics, such as vessel shape, under the direc- tion of Ana Maria Lorandi (ICA, CONICET). Central- West (Cuyana) Region. Juan Schobinger (Universidad Nacional de Cuyo) resumed research on the mummy of Aconcagua, a wonderfully preserved eight-year-old infant, found some years ago at 5,300 m. The body was bundled in some 12 wrappings. Be- side it, six statuettes were found (three llamas and three human males, dressed), all unmistakably Inca. Several institutions, Argentine and Chilean, are participating in different aspects of the study. After a fellowship in Spain, Roberto Barcena (UNC, CONICET), has finished excavations at Rockshelter I, Arroyo Tambillos. Continuing his long-range research on the Inca, he surveyed all the rooms of the Tambillos tampu and took photographs from an aerostatic bal- loon. One peculiar structure to the east of the tampu was excavated, looking for differential function. Bar- cena also began digging at Paso de los Paramillos, a rock shelter in the Sierra of Uspallata. The site is likely to have connections with the eastern piedmont of the Cordillera due to its strategic situation at 2,900 m. Occupation begins in the Preceramic period and per- sists to the end of the nineteenth century. Humberto A. Lagiglia (Museo Municipal de Historia Natural de San Rafael, Mendoza) discovered and sur- veyed new archaeological sites in southern Mendoza province, in the lower sierras as well as in the Andean Cordillera. Lagiglia received CONICET support for work at eleven archaeological sites at Agua de la Mula, 100 km south of San Rafael, including a cave in which soft, dry sediments, preserved cord, textiles, seeds, and wild plants. Samples were picked up for radiocarbon and pollen analyses. Three components are defined: hunter-gatherers of the final Preceramic stage, with triangular projectile points and skin scrapers; hunters and maize and squash cultivators, possibly comparable to those of the Atuel II Period (300 B.C. to A.D. 100); and a third period characterized by pottery, weaving, hunting-gathering, and agriculture. Valliserrana Region. Beatriz Cremonte (Instituto In- terdisciplinario Tilcara) is analyzing pottery excavated at La Cienega (Tucuman province) in 1981-1984. Set- tlement is attributed to the Fafi Culture of the Early Agricultural and Pottery-Making period (A.D. 0-700). Neutron activation analyses at the Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica facilitate studies on raw materials used and their origins. Together with Myriam Tarrago (UBA, CONICET) Cremonte is studying technology and style of wares from the Late Period sites of the Quebrada de Humahuaca. These comparative studies include experimenting with and recording of different 185</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY manufacturing techniques used today in the Puna of Jujuy, the Quebrada de Humahuaca, and the Calchaqui and Santa Maria valleys, as well as the location of raw material sources. Maria Carlota Sempe (MLP, CONICET) will begin a stylistic analysis of the Muniz Barreto collection de- posited at the Museo de La Plata. The project involves a contextual and ideological study of the funerary pot- tery of 10 archaeological cemeteries from Belen in Cat- amarca province. Sponsored by CONICET, Sempe is attempting to understand microcultural change by in- vestigating the acceptance or rejection of new elements from past cultures. Accordingly, a rigorous method- ology will be used in order to turn the stylistic analysis into a research instrument of anthropological value. The absolute chronology already available for the Val- liserrana region can, according to Sempe, be made use- ful only through an analysis of ceramic contexts, in- trasite variation, and intersite correspondences, especially those that argue in favor of contemporaneity or the character of their sociocultural relationships. Modes that define styles and traditions should reveal internal laws. Collaborating with Sempe are Mercedes Perez Meroni and Nora Zagorodny (both MLP). For years, Gabriela Ravina (MLP, CONICET) has been doing research in northeastern La Rioja province, especially in Castro Barros, where the La Aguada Cul- ture reveals Tiwanaku influences about A.D. 650-850. The main site consists of a group ofhabitational nuclei distributed along the piedmont of the Sierra de Velas- co, at about 1,500 m. In the typical Formative settle- ment pattern, contiguous rooms are distributed around a central court, each compound being located between 100 and 500 m away from another, surrounded by a 30 x 20 m pirca wall, and internally split into 6 to 10 constructional units. All compounds or nuclei have a large irregular court within the walled unit. The 8 ra- diocarbon dates already available place the occupation between 1440 and 1150 B.P. Alberto Rex Gonsalez (MLP, CONICET) has fin- ished a study of metal plaques of the southern Andes, based on more than 300 gold, copper, silver, and bronze plates, either plain or decorated, distributed in Amer- ican and European museums, which were discovered in the Circum-Titicaca area of Bolivia and the Beni, northern Chile and northwest Argentina. The earliest date to ca. 500 B.C., but there is evident continuity to examples from historic times. Ethnohistorical, eth- nographic, and folklore sources, together with the icon- ographic study, allow Gonzalez to hypothesize that the plates were used for agrarian ceremonies related to fertility, and affiliated with heavenly deities, that in- volved human sacrifices and the use of hallucinogens. Under the direction of Alberto Rex Gonzalez, Maria Delia Arena (MLP) is analyzing the burial modes of the agricultural and pottery-making cultures of the Val- liserrana region, based on the Benjamin Muniz Barreto Collection. Two aspects are currently in development: (a) the La Aguada Culture of the Northwest Middle period, and (b) an analysis of the early (Formative) cultural material that defines a relation between the Hualfin Valley (Catamarca province) and the northern section of the Calchaqui Valley (Salta province), es- pecially the Kipon zone. Sierras Centrales. Andres Laguens (Universidad Nacional de Cordoba) and Mirta Bonnin (IAUNC, CONICET) have begun a project in the Copacabana Basin of Cordoba based on a model of interaction be- tween man and environment. They recognize three ecological zones (sierras, plains, and salt flats) and two ecotones modified by climatic events during the last 8,000 years. Each zone may have allowed different survival strategies. A study of historical sources from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries suggests that aboriginal exploitative practices were not responsible for substantial vegetational changes, but that these arose with the introduction of European cattle. One site, El Ranchito, in the Plains zone, was excavated and yield- ed a lanceolate-point lithic industry of Ayampitin tra- dition, dated to 2950 + 180 B.P. Laguens and Bonnin also are responsible for a program involving the cre- ation of an archaeological park and a natural reserve in the Cerro Colorado locality. To that end a systematic survey is being carried out by Sandra Diaz (UNC, CONICET), Maria del R. Prieto (CONICET, INAN- IGLA), Barbara Manasse (MLP), and Felicitas Silvetti, Lina Seisdedos, and Alberto J. Marcellino (LAUNC). The project on genetics and microevolution of South American aboriginal populations, developed jointly by researchers of CONICET, CONICYT (Chile), and CNPq (Brazil), continues under the direction of Fran- cisco Rothhammer (Chile), Francisco Salzano (Brazil), and Jose A. Cocilovo (Argentina). Silvia Quevedo and E. Llop have joined the Chilean staff, while Sidia Cal- legari-Jacques and Walter Neves are associated with Salzano. Collaborating with Cocilovo (Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto) is Osvaldo Mendonca (UNRC, CONICET). In 1986 the First International Workshop on Genetics and Microevolution of South American Aboriginal Populations was held at the UNRC. A sec- ond international workshop will be held at Arica (Chile) in 1988. Northeast. Martin Giesso (Museo Municipal Parque Schwelm. Misiones Province) leads a CONICET proj- ect on the occupation of caves and shelters on the Middle Parana River and its tributaries. He also has contracted with Electricidad de Misiones, S.A. (EMSA) to carry out research in an area of about 9,000 ha that will be flooded by a hydroelectric project at the end of 1988. Similarly, in connection with the binational commitment for the building of the Yacireta hydro- electric dam. Ruth Adela Poujade has surveyed and done salvage archaeology in the riverine area of the Posadas municipality, on the Parana River and its trib- utaries. Antonia Rizzo (MLP) has begun research on the history of the city of Eldorado, Misiones, founded in 1910. She is working with documentary sources and on collecting the oral tradition of this German enclave, and is studying the different environmental-adaptation systems established by the original German settlers. Northern Pampas. Maria Isabel Gonzalez de Bona- veri (ICA, CONICET) is working on a model of Pre- hispanic occupation of the depressed Pampa north of the Salado River, Buenos Aires province. Her model of lacustrine exploitation is based on three site-location classes: sites in ravines, not disturbed by ploughing; plough-disturbed sites on the plains; and site locations at stream outlets into lagoons. Gonzlez de Bonaveri 186 [Vol. 53, No. 1, 1988]</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEARCH has centered her interest on otter exploitation, which she supposes has been a continuous activity in the area. Gustavo Politis (MLP, CONICET) has ended the first stage of excavations at the La Toma site (Buenos Aires province), working with Monica Salemme (MLP), Patricia Madrid (MLP), and Fernando Oliva (MLP). An occupational sequence beginning in the Middle Ho- locene (determined by stratigraphy and by 14C dates of 5505 ? 200 B.P. and 3985 ? 110 B.P.) ends a few centuries before Hispanic contact (995 ? 65 B.P.). The lower levels exhibit unifacially worked lithic materials, though a fragment of a bifacially worked lanceolate point is associated with guanaco remains. The upper levels contain "pampaean" pottery, small triangular bifacial points, and a greater variety in faunal mate- rials. A human burial (dating from 2075 ? 70 B.P.) was found at the base of the sequence. At Laguna Tres Reyes a biface was recovered in the same stratigraphic unit where Pleistocene faunal remains were found. The upper levels evidence a late occupation with profuse lithic and ceramic remains. At Arroyo Seco-2, Politis recovered more Pleistocene faunal remains associated with artifacts. Politis and Patricia Lozano (UBA) also are working on the La Olla seal-processing site, origi- nally located by the shore of a littoral lagoon. Abundant tools with polished, plain faces were found, in addition to plant remains associated with unifacially worked lithic artifacts such as scrapers. Patricia Madrid (MLP) surveyed and dug test pits at several sites at Tornquist and Coronel Pringles, Buenos Aires province. The Claverizo site yielded human remains currently under analysis. Together with Fernando Oliva, she registered rock paintings in various caves of the Ventana system. Abundant and complex motifs were recorded at Cerro Manitoba and Florecio. Nora Flegenheimer (MLP, CONICET) excavated two Paleoindian sites in Loberia (Buenos Aires province). At Cerro La China small charcoal samples from the earliest occupations provided 14C dates of 10,790 ? 120 B.P. (AA-1327)and 10,610 ? 180 B.P. (AA-1328). A Paleoindian workshop at the nearby site of Cerro El Sombrero is yielding a substantial amount of remains. R. Pla (National Commission of Atomic Energy) and B. Cremonte (Tilcara, CONICET) are investigating the origin of the local pottery using neutron activation analysis. This approach also is being used in Buenos Aires province to determine the origin of lithic ma- terial. Patagonia. Luis Alberto Borrero (PREP, CONICET) still is working on the large rockshelter at Piedra del Aguila, which reveals a long, stratified sequence. He also has finished a comparative analysis of faunal as- semblages, dominated by guanaco remains, from var- ious places in Patagonia. Rafael Goni (INA, CONICET) is studying the late aboriginal settlements (up to the 19th Century) in the Cordilleran region of Neuquen province. Sites include corrals, fortified enclosures, and watchpoints associ- ated with the transportation of cattle to Chile and the securing of economic, social, political, and territorial interests. Elena B. de Perrotta and Isabel Pereda, under the auspices of ICA, continue excavating Alero IV Tromen in Neuquen province. Jorge Merenzon collaborates in the study of substances adhering to scrapers and pes- tles. Carlos J. Gradin (INA, CONICET) and Ana Maria Aguerre (ICA, CONICET), with collaboration from Monica A. Beron, are doing salvage archaeology along the south bank of the Colorado River (Rio Negro prov- ince) as a result of the construction of a dam and res- ervoir there. To date, they have studied the late period of aboriginal occupation when pottery normally was used. Radiocarbon dates range between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries. As a part of a rescue operation at Piedra Parada (Chubut), directed by Carlos Aschero, Cecilia Periz de Micou (INA, CONICET) is studying plant remains re- covered from Campo Moncada-2 dating between 5080 ? 90 B.P. and 780 ? 80 B.P. She is trying to specify the territory and the site-catchment area of every component, and is studying specialization or diversi- fication of plant resources through time. Cristina Bel- lelli (INA, CONICET) is focusing on the early com- ponents of Campo Moncada-2, especially concentrating on analysis of the blade industry and modification of differential use areas. Maria Onetto (ICA, CONICET) is investigating the middle course of the Chubut River, including the Piedra Parada and the Las Plumas areas. Onetto has recorded more than 20 sites with rock art and has seriated a local style sequence. She is also involved with sites belonging to the historical-period Tehuelchense culture. Augusto Cardich (MLP) continues to coordinate a project in northern Santa Cruz, between the Deseado and Chico rivers, about which details were given in the last Southern Cone report. Laura L. Miotti (MLP, CONICET) is working with Cardich, but also with M. Estela Mansur-Franchomme (Centro Austral de In- vestigaciones Cientificas) in a study embracing central- south Santa Cruz province. Miotti is concentrating on experimental studies of intentional bone fractures. As is usual with ecological approaches, she aims at iden- tifying the processing and/or fabrication of natural re- sources within a system where other factors intervene, such as seasonal availability of resources and mobility of human groups. Alicia Castro de Aguilar (MLP, CONICET) has un- dertaken both fieldwork and lab analyses for Cardich's project. She has continued excavations at Caves 2 and 13 of Los Toldos, locating workshops and raw-material procurement areas. Three other sites were excavated on the southern coast (FOI, CA, and LPM), with ex- perimental taphonomic studies at LPM. In the lab, Castro has continued the elaboration of a lithic ty- pology for the diverse industries of the southern coast and central plateau, which will allow for work on a comparative basis. She also completed a techno-func- tional study of the Casapedrense industry, following analyses of the same kind carried out on the Level 11 and Toldense industries. As a supplementary part of her research, Castro systematically is surveying and in- terpreting the rock-art expressions of Los Toldos cul- ture before they are completely destroyed. In the department of Rio Chico, Santa Cruz, Carlos Aschero is assisted by Cecilia Perez de Micou, Chris- tina Bellelli, and Rafael Goni. They are studying the functional variability of hunter-gatherer settlements in 187</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the area of the Perito Moreno National Park. Both cave and open-air settlements currently are under study. Local resource exploitation, beginning by 6780 ? 110 B.P. (AC-530), was based on hunting of Lama glarma guanicoe, Hippocamelus bisulcus and smaller fauna, as well as on collection of lithic raw material and of di- verse plant resources. Carlos J. Gradin and Ana M. Aguerre continue re- search in the related area of Rio Pinturas and the cen- tral plateau of Santa Cruz province, also under the direction of Cardich. In addition to concerning them- selves with rock art, they have carried out excavations with the collaboration of Teresa A. Lopez at Puesto El Rodeo, which was used as a cemetery from the fourth millennium B.P. until the fifth century A.D. Jose Luis Lanata (UBA, PREP, CONICET) is di- recting a project in the Ushuahia Peninsula, Tierra del Fuego. As a result of bulldozing to enlarge the Ushua- hia airport, more than 100 of about 230 pit houses were destroyed before Lanata and associates began res- cue operations. Two superimposed shell middens were found, separated by a clay layer. Seal, guanaco, and bird remains are scarce, while fish vertebrae abound. Stone tools are almost absent, and only two bird-bone needles were found, made of metatarsals. Lanata also directs an archaeological project on the Northern Pen- insula Mitre, where excavations continue at Estancia Maria Luisa. The diverse artifacts found suggest a hab- itational site, although a human skeleton also was found, with the head pointing north and hands crossed on the pelvis. Hugo Nami continues with functional, typo- logical, and technological studies involving experi- mental replication of lithic artifacts from the large workshops studied by Lanata and him last year. The research is sponsored by the Territorial Museum of Tierra del Fuego. Although the date is late, Levallois- like flake production has been observed. Luis Abel Orquera and Ernesto Luis Piana finished the excavation of Tunel I and II and Shumakush I and II, on the Beagle Channel. Hernan Vidal continued work at Bahia Valentin XI (Peninsula Mitre), exca- vating the upper levels of the shell midden. At Bahia Valentin 40 sites were surveyed, of which nine were excavated. An hypothesis has been proposed to explain the existence of three specialized littoral-settlement types. These include sites for seal capture, shoal re- source exploitation or beach collection, and base camps in wooded areas close to the coast and to riverine val- leys. Pablo Camera (MTF) carried out excavations at Playa del Puente, a site dating to the Contact period. CHILE. Miguel Cervellino Giannoni (Museo Re- gional de Atacama) and Nelson Sill Aguirre, Professor of Art at the University of Atacama, have carried out three seasons of excavation and surveying at Finca de Chanaral, an oasis in the desert close to an Inca road. According to Spanish chroniclers, it was an important Inca enclave. Eight funerary tumuli and 12 habitational structures have been excavated. More than 200 rock paintings were recorded. Cervellino G., Hans Niemeyer F. (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, MNHN), and Gaston Castillo G. (Museo Arqueologico de La Serena) are studying the Carrizalillo Chico site, in the Pulido River valley in the upper reaches of the Copiapo River. Excavations in this El Molle village (300 B.C.-A.D. 700) have pro- duced pottery, agricultural tools, corn remains, and human skeletons in funerary tumuli. A fourth and last field season was carried out in 1987, after which two adjacent sites, the pucaras of Puntilla Blanca and Que- brada Seca, will be studied. With grants from the National Geographic Society and the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, Ruben Stehberg, head of the Archaeology Lab, MNHN of Santiago, has discovered long segments of the Inca road system on the western slope of south- ern Andes. The principal findings were between the valleys of Aconcagua to the south and of Limare to the North. Conservation was very good at Alicahue, Estero del Valle, and Curamavida. There were tampus at Ali- cahue and Conchuca. The rediscovery of the transver- sal sections of the Inca road at Resguardo Los Patos, Illapel, and Upper Rio Hurtado was most important. At the latter, the intact tampus of La Laguna and Guan- dacol were found, as well as the high-altitude Inca campsite of El Volcan. Stehberg will continue his re- search along the Inca road between the valleys of Li- mari and Huasco, including the transverse branches. Nuriluz Hermosilla and Jose Miguel Ramirez (Mu- seo Sociedad Fonck, Vina del Mar) are collaborating with Juan Carlos Castilla (Universidad Catolica) on an interdisciplinary research project studying depredation by seafood gatherers in intertidal rocky waters in Cen- tral Chile, particularly focusing on their impact on community structure and dynamics. A first phase in- volves the excavation of a shell midden south of Val- paraiso. The deposit is dense and thick, 40 m in di- ameter, and contains a wide variety of shellfish, sea mammals, and birds. Fish are not well represented, but this midden illustrates the selective depredation pres- sure of past human communities on the intertidal fau- na. Artifacts point to an Early Archaic occupation be- tween 6000 and 4000 B.C., with stemmed points at lower levels, followed by a series of ceramic occupa- tions. Americo Gordon, with a grant from the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Technologica (CONICYT), continues to excavate a small Spanish fort in Carilafquen on the southern bank of the Tolten River, east of modern Pitrufquen, south-central Chile. The fort supposedly was built by the first Spaniards to arrive there in the mid-sixteenth century. It was at- tacked, burned, and conquered by the Mapuche during the great insurrection of 1699. Gordon's latest field work has exposed palisade postholes, house posts, and sharpened stakes belonging to the surrounding moat. In 1987, Tom D. Dillehay (University of Kentucky) spent two months working on an ethnographic recon- struction of earthen burial mounds of the Mapuche society. A wealth of information on construction pro- cedure, grave content, and social and religious meaning of burial was obtained. These data will be combined with previous studies on Mapuche ceremonial fields to gain a deeper understanding of the use and function of religious centers and ritual goods. Dillehay also taught a short course at the Universidad Catolica de Chile. This work was sponsored by the Fulbright Commis- sion. 188 [Vol. 53, No. 1, 1988]</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT RESEARCH Jorge Eduardo Inostroza S. (Museo Regional de la Araucania [MRA]) has been studying the sites Quillen-I and Quino-1, in the ninth region (Araucania). Quillen- I, a habitational site and lithic workshop, has two main levels: one aceramic (110-60 cm deep) with hearths and projectile points, but few milling stones, '4C-dated at 4675 ? 105 B.P. (BETA-4710) and an upper one (60 cm to surface) with more milling artifacts, a variety of projectile points, and a growing number of tunduco (Aconaemys fuscus) and Dyplodon valves. A 14C date places this level at 2030 ? 70 B.P. (BETA-4709). Qui- no-1 corroborates the cultural context of Quillen-I, save for the fact that food remains are much more abundant in the former, suggesting different functions for the sites. Historical archaeology at Quillen (Agua de los Choros) relates to the ruins of a small Spanish structure near the ancient Ciudad Imperial, founded by Pedro de Valdivia. A third project involves archaeological research in the Pilauco Bajo, tenth region (Los Lagos). A possible Paleoindian site at Osorno displays an ex- tinct fauna (mainly Mastodon sp.) that may be asso- ciated with human activity. Museological studies un- derway at the MRA concern the ethnographic collection San Juan de la Costa-representing the southernmost Mapuche-and the ethnographic collection of Isla Hu- api (ninth region), on the coast of Puerto Saavedra- representing one of the most authentic and traditional Mapuche areas of Cautin province. Fernanda Falabella G., secretary, Sociedad Chilena de Arqueologia, reports the availability of numbers 4 and 5 of the Boletfn of the Society, where most Chilean archaeological activity is summarized by directors of projects and collaborators. The Boletfn includes field reports, obituaries, news, essays, reviews, proposals for research in Chile, and reports on meetings. Victoria Castro R. (Universidad de Chile) reports on activities in cooperation with the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino. Both institutions are sponsoring and financing a long-term project, begun in 1986, which will integrate the study of Turi and Paniri (second re- gion) with an evaluation of their role in the circumpuna environment. Endangered monuments such as the Pu- kara de Turi will be mapped and efforts made at con- servation. Also, comparative studies of prehistoric and present agricultural practices and fauna have been car- ried out. Documents dating back to the nineteenth cen- tury were investigated at the Archivo Nacional de Bo- livia (Sucre). During the present year, work at the pukara will continue, and the prehispanic agricultural complex of Paniri will be studied in terms of environmental adaptation. Participating in the project are Victoria Castro, Jose Luis Martinez, Carlos Aldunate del Solar, and Luis Cornejo. URUGUAY. Jorge Femenias (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural) reports on an archaeological salvage project in the Laguna Merin and adjacent Laguna Ne- gra (department of Rocha), where swamp drainage work has begun. The Ministerio de Educacion y Cultura is sponsoring and financing this project, staffed by Leonel Cabrera Perez and Elianne Martinez (Comision de Pa- trimonio Historico [CPH]), and Jose Maria Lopez Mass and Arturo Toscano (Museo Nacional de Antropolo- gia). The study area has a high concentration of mounds that were surveyed by land, air, and water during two field seasons in cooperation with students and military personnel. Archaeological material includes lithic ar- tifacts and pottery. Preservation of bone-artifacts as well as food remains-is excellent. Geomorphologists, zoologists, and other scientists are cooperating with laboratory studies of human skeletons, charcoal, etc. The CPH, with Cabrera, Martinez, Maria del Carmen Curbelo, and Nelsys Fusco also is working on the ar- chaeological rescue project developed for the area to be flooded by the Paso Severino Dam (department of Florida). Fieldwork has ended and lab studies are now under way. The same personnel are surveying Gorriti Island (department of Maldonado) to map colonial ar- chitectural remains. This would eventually lead to the construction of a museum there. In addition, an up- dating of all archaeological sites known for Uruguay is planned. After a bibliographic survey, fieldwork will supplement available information. Arturo Toscano (Museo Nacional de Anthropologia) is surveying prehistoric and historical-period sites in the Uruguay and San Salvador river valleys. Leonel Cabrera Perez (Universidad de la Republica) is sur- veying systematically the archaeological pottery and associated contexts for central and southeastern Uru- guay, using private and museum collections from Mon- tevideo and the interior. Likewise, Monica Sans has finished the first stage of her study of the prehistoric populations of Uruguay, centering on craniometric measurements of human remains deposited in the mu- seums of Montevideo, with emphasis on the masti- catory apparatus. More than 80 examples from 19 Uru- guayan sites were measured and analyzed for maxillary traits and dental characteristics such as abrasion, car- ies, shovel-shaped incisors, etc. The variables were used to compute biological distances. Jose Maria Lopez Mass, from the same university, directs a project on economic development, modernization, and prehistoric cultural patrimony. As a first step, an evaluation is being made of the level of general preservation of archaeological sites, kind of deterioration and reasons for it (urban projects, industrial, agricultural or other causes). This is to be combined with a comparative study of legis- lation on cultural patrimony and protective measures adopted in other countries, in an effort to improve Uruguayan legislation. Other analyses will help to de- fine "rescue" archaeology from the administrative and judicial viewpoints. Bernard Dougherty CARIBBEAN BAHAMAS. The question of the location of Co- lumbus' first landfall in the New World has been de- scribed variously as a historical mystery of great in- terest or, on the other hand, of no significance from the perspective of the larger concept of Old World- New World contact. While we know it was in the Ba- hamas, we do not know the exact island upon which Columbus first set foot on October 12, 1492. The five-hundredth anniversary of that landing still is five years away, but already the pace is quickening 189</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY as archaeologists search for clues on perhaps a dozen Bahamian islands. Two important meetings-a confer- ence and a debate-were held on the subject during the past year, and a third on the prehistoric Bahamians is in the planning stages. The research problem includes archaeological ex- cavations to demonstrate Bahamian-Spanish contact, in support of conclusions concerning Columbus' track through the Bahamas, or to tell us something of the nature of the contact itself. Early Spanish artifacts in a Lucayan settlement might be the result of a friendly visit by Columbus himself, or the result of Spanish slavers using the artifacts to lure the aborigines out of hiding. This does not mean that current research ac- tivities do not include efforts to better understand Lu- cayan social cultural systems. Such interests are there, but they often are a bit overshadowed by the rising interest in the Columbus landfall issue. In October 1986, some 70 scholars from Italy to California met on San Salvador Island at the College Center of the Finger Lakes (CCFL) Bahamian Field Station to discuss Columbus the man, Columbus' trans- Atlantic trip, possible sites of his first landfall (at least four were discussed), and his track through the islands of the Bahamas. Supporters of three of these islands (Egg Island near Eleuthera, San Salvador, and Turks and Caicos) defended their cases and generally con- cluded that the absent fourth (Samana Cay) had to be incorrect. In April 1987, chief proponent for San Sal- vador Island (Mauricio Obregon, Univ. of the Andes, Bogota, Colombia) debated the proponent for Samana Cay (Joseph Judge, National Geographic) before some 800 people in Nassau. Both used existing archaeolog- ical research results, among other things, to support their cases. There was no declared winner. A large part of the problem is that we do not as yet have much information on the indigenous peoples whom Columbus met-the Lucayans. There have been relatively few excavations in the Bahamas and many of these have been on a single island. Consequently we still are having trouble "telling time" in Bahamian sites and understanding the synchronic and diachronic re- lations between the occupants and their Greater An- tillean homeland. To remedy this, a seminar focusing on "who were the Lucayans?" is scheduled for No- vember 1987 on Grand Bahama Island. CONCEPTION ISLAND, BAHAMAS. As a result of a chance comment by Bruce Van Sant (Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic), captain of the ketch Jalan Jalan, Nancy Watford Hoffman (George Washington Uni- versity) carried out archaeological surveys on Concep- tion Island in the central Bahamas. Van Sant felt that the description of the island of Columbus' first landfall closely matched that of Conception. In May 1987, Hoffman made a brief survey of two locations on this small, uninhabited cay. Six Lucayan sites were located. Despite a lack of potable water in the vicinity, one site contained a large amount of apparently intact material including diagnostic fragments of Lucayan Palmetto ware vessels, shell, and fire-cracked rock. Conception Island now is under the jurisdiction of the Bahamas National Trust. Hoffman recommended that the site remain in a "state of preservation" until arrangements for systematic recovery of artifacts can be made, but she would not say whether or not she believes Van Sant is correct about Conception being the scene of Colum- bus' initial landfall. SAMANA CAY, BAHAMAS. With publication of a National Geographic article in November 1986 identifying Samana Cay as the "real" San Salvador of Columbus, controversy has swarmed about this sparse- ly inhabited cay in the south-central Bahamas. As re- ported last year, 11 prehistoric sites were located within a few days in a beach ridge behind a bay in the center of the island. Two of these sites were excavated, only proving that it is possible that Samana was occupied by Lucayans on October 12, 1492. In 1987 Charles A. Hoffman (College of the Bahamas Fulbright Scholar) located a twelfth site in such a lo- cation as to substantiate that there may have been Lucayan structures near a rocky point of land, just as Columbus reported. With the assistance of Daniel Ca- mejo and his ketch Caribana, four bodies of water and one small rock catchment in the interior of the island were found to be saline. Tests for salinity were con- ducted by Neil Sealey (College of the Bahamas) with equipment loaned by the Bahamas Ministry of Works. In addition, cores of subsurface sediments were ex- tracted to determine whether or not a lagoon existed behind the archaeological sites on the beach ridge at the time of Columbus. These should lead to a better understanding of the geological history of the point of land. SAN SALVADOR ISLAND, BAHAMAS. Hoffman and Hoffman continued excavations at the Long Bay site on the west coast of San Salvador in 1986 and 1987, the former year sponsored by the National Geo- graphic Society, the latter by the Science Museum of Charlotte, North Carolina. All work was carried out through the CCFL Bahamian Field Station on San Sal- vador. As before, additional evidence of very early historic contact was found (green and yellow glass seed beads, Spanish pottery, metals) in direct association with Lucayan Palmetto ware. Spanish material found to date includes the beads, bronze buckles, a Spanish coin minted between 1471 and 1474, majolica, mela- do ware, olive jar fragments, and ships' planking nails and hooks. Columbus reported trading glass beads, broken crockery, and coins to the aborigines when he landed on San Salvador. Many small fragments of sul- fur and tiny turquoise-colored grains also were found. They have been submitted for tests to confirm their nature. These tiny grains of material may have been used to make gun powder and therefore were items traded by the early Spanish to the Lucayans. Lucayan artifacts include Palmetto Plain and Palmetto Cross- hatched Incised ceramics, shell ornaments and tools, chert pieces, a quartz cobble, and coral files and abrad- ers. Activity areas within the Long Bay site were iden- tified, one characterized by a hearth and extensive charred bone and fire-cracked rock, another by pres- ence of juvenile Stroimbus tests, tiny conch shell frag- ments, bead "blanks," partly drilled beads, and fin- ished beads. Investigation into the subsistence economy of pre- 190 [Vol. 53, No. 1, 1988]</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT RESEARCH historic Lucayans continued at the Three Dog site, un- der the supervision of Mary Jane Berman (Museum of Anthropology, Wake Forest University) and Perry O. Gnivecki (Hartwick College). Students from Hartwick and Sweetbriar Colleges participated in the excavation of midden and activity areas. Plant and seed recovery was conducted by Richard I. Ford (University of Mich- igan), who has sent them to Deborah Pearsall (Uni- versity of Missouri-Columbia) for analysis. A ther- moluminescence date (Alpha Analytic) of A.D. 1500 + 170 from pottery and a 14C date (Beta Analytic) of A.D. 1460 + 70 from turtle bone have been obtained. A lead-isotope ratio test performed by the National Bu- reau of Standards on a lead ball indicated that the lead closely matches that of a shoe buckle found at the Long Bay site, a short distance north on the west coast of San Salvador. LONG ISLAND, BAHAMAS. Research at the Hossie Harbor site was conducted by Mary Jane Ber- man and Perry L. Gnivecki, with students from Hart- wick College. They recovered limestone- and shell- tempered Palmetto ware, fish bone, and Strombus fragments, along with a worked piece of shell resem- bling the zemi "mouth" found at the site three years ago. NEW PROVIDENCE, BAHAMAS. Test excava- tions at a cave site several km inland from the north coast of New Providence were conducted by Charles Hoffman. The cave is composed of two adjacent rooms, roughly 5 m wide by 15 m deep. It faces out from a limestone ridge onto farmland. He found pottery, shell, bone, marine-shell tools and beads, and bones from land and sea fauna. Work was carried out with the assistance of students from the College of the Bahamas and the Bahamas Archaeological Team. Inland sites in the Bahamas seem to be rare. This cave may have been simply a "field house" for persons tending adjacent farms. However, the high incidence (50 percent) of nonlocal pottery hints that it actually was a multiple- activity area. BAHAMAS, GENERAL. Steven W. Mitchell (California State College, Bakersfield) is carrying out research on the provenience of classic Taino and Span- ish ceramics associated with Lucayan Taino sites and Spanish shipwrecks in the Bahamas. Temper from hundreds of Taino sherds from throughout the archi- pelago, as well as from comparative sites in the Greater Antilles, has been analyzed. Similar approaches have been used in temper analysis of several hundred sam- ples of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Spanish tinajas (olive jars) from the Bahamas and very early settle- ments in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. Detailed sedimentological field mapping in southern Spain is planned to determine specific pro- veniences for the wide diversity of temper assemblages found in New World tinajas. Mitchell feels that this extensive data base documents a complicated prehis- toric Lucayan Taino trade network and temper-based chronological sequences in both the classic Taino and Spanish ceramics associated with Lucayan Taino sites in the Bahamas. JAMAICA. Elizabeth J. Reitz (University of Geor- gia) is identifying vertebrate remains from four slave dwellings excavated by Barry Higman (University of the West Indies, Mona) at New Montpelier Village, Jamaica. This is one of the very few zooarchaeological samples from a slave settlement outside of the United States. Preliminary results indicate that the faunal as- semblage is similar to that of Drax Hall slave village, also on Jamaica, and unlike those from plantations in the United States. The collection contains a high per- centage of domestic livestock and very few fish. The collection contains pond turtles, which may have con- tributed as much to the diet as chickens and even cap- rines. TORTOLA, BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS. Remains of an extensive prehistoric village have been discovered at Long Bay, on the west end of Tortola. Although other prehistoric sites have been reported from bays on the north shore of Tortola, the Belmont Grove site is the first to be investigated systematically. In conjunction with the Virgin Islands Historical So- ciety, Elizabeth Righter (U.S. Virgin Islands) directed survey and testing at the site, to ascertain the distri- bution of resources and activity areas. Preservation is excellent. About 180 m inland from the present beach berm, and 5 cm below the surface, a complete ear- thenware bowl, with rim diameter of more than 45 cm, was recovered. Other items include spindle whorls, zemis, small bowls, petaloid stone celts and celts fab- ricated from the lips of Strombus shells. Little in the way of archaeological research has been conducted in the British Virgin Islands, and the ce- ramics have not been identified. However, pottery from Belmont Grove appears to be similar to that from the upper strata of the Calabash Boom site (St. John, USVI). No Saladoid series sherds were identified. The Virgin Islands Historical Society is raising funds to finance full-scale excavation of the Belmont Grove site. It is threatened by development, an ever-increasing prob- lem in the Caribbean, and by the fact the BVI lacks enforceable preservation laws. ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. The Zu- friedenheit Plantation is situated on Magens Bay (for- merly Store Nordside Bay) of St. Thomas, USVI, where the watershed has been occupied continuously since about A.D. 700, when a prehistoric village was estab- lished on the bay. In 1983 it was recognized that the watershed contained many resources and that evidence of the history of St. Thomas as a whole was present in the archaeological deposits. Zufriedenheit Plantation was selected as a unit of study for a multi-disciplinary archaeology project, the goal of which is to document, spatially and chronologically, changes in land use dur- ing its 1,300-year human occupation. To date, seven prehistoric-activity loci have been located and inves- tigated, and three areas of Colonial residential and eco- nomic activity have been identified. The latter span the period between A.D. 1680 and 1900, when Zu- friedenheit Plantation was incorporated into a larger plantation and its acreage was allowed to revert to bush. Archaeological research includes that by Eliza- beth Righter and Elizabeth Reitz. 191</page><page sequence="15">192 AMERICAN The Division for Archaeology and Historical Pres- ervation, USVI Planning Office, reports a C'4 date of 1770 ? 235 B.P. (A.D. 180, Kreuger Enterprises, Inc.) for a charcoal sample recovered from a prehistoric cul- tural midden buried beneath Main Street in the vicinity of Kronprindsens Market, Charlotte Amalie. The sam- ple was collected by Patton Mulford, Emily Lundberg, and Righter during archaeological monitoring of the water main installation last spring. This date corre- sponds well to dates for similar deposits in Puerto Rico and tends to confirm findings by Irving Rouse (Yale University) that the ceramics from the Main Street site belong to the Cedrosan Saladoid subseries. Makers of Cedrosan pottery probably moved into the Virgin Is- lands area from coastal northern Venezuela sometime after A.D. 100. These people introduced pottery mak- ing into the Caribbean islands and extensively de- pended on agriculture. Until the Main Street site was identified, the only evidence of village settlement by ANTIQUITY [Vol. 53, No. 1, 1988] Cedrosan pottery makers in St. Thomas was at Hassel Island. ST. JOHN, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. Excavation of a three-acre site at Calabash Boom in Coral Bay, St. John, has provided evidence of over 500 years of pre- historic habitation. At the lowest level of a stratified midden, Margaret Caesar, Lundberg, and Philip Caesar found pottery of the late Saladoid style. At a depth of 50-80 cm the ceramics were of Elenan and Ostionan styles. Esperanza style pottery was found in the 0-40 cm stratum. Radiocarbon dates of A.D. 660 and 1200, respectively, were obtained for these strata. Also found in the midden were the first Indian burials recorded on St. John, including skeletons showing evidence of cannibalism. Manatee bones, one worked into a three- pointed object, were found in both strata. Charles A. Hoffman 4 r</page></plain_text>
