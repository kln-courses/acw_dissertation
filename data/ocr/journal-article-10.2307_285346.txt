<plain_text><page sequence="1">* ABSTRACT This paper examines the resurgence of interest in the interpretation of quantum theory which occurred in the late 1940s and 1950s, and seeks to uncover its political origins in a perceived clash between the post- War Stalinist interpretation of dialectical materialism and the 'Copenhagen' interpretation of quantum mechanics. In examining the debate that followed this renewed interest, certain issues concerning scientific argument are touched upon. These relate particularly to the progress of scientific dispute in a context in which no appeal to experiment can be made. This unusual state of affairs raises questions as to whether such disputes can be resolved, and if so, how. In order to explore these questions, the outcomes of the debates in the USSR and in the West are discussed. The Crisis in Physics: Dialectical Materialism and Quantum Theory Andrew Cross The 'crisis in physics' is an episode in the history of science which touches on a number of issues relevant to the sociology of scientific knowledge. Its particular interest lies in the fact that the debate concerning the interpretation of quantum theory which constituted the 'crisis' was generated and sustained by political imperatives, producing a controversy which could not be settled by any reference to experiment, or to mathematical elucidation of the theory. As a result, the 'crisis in physics' provides an opportunity to study how scientists seek to resolve a dispute couched in terms of scientific methodology and political philosophy, rather than in those of ex- perimental data or mathematical proof. From the historian's point of view, the 'crisis in physics' is of note in that it provides an explanation of the renewed interest in the foun- dations of quantum theory in the West which emerged after World War 11. The mathematical apparatus or 'formalism' of quantum mechanics SocialStudies of Science (SAGE, London, Newbury Park and New Delhi), Vol. 21 (1991), 735-59</page><page sequence="2">736 Social Studies of Science was pretty much settled by the late 1920s. Certain features of it, however, such as the duality of waves and particles, the nature of the 'wave-function' and Heisenberg's celebrated 'Uncertainty Relations' presented interpretative difficulties which were debated well into the 1930s.' Some degree of consensus was achieved with Niels Bohr's 'complementarity' view, though some of those most closely involved with the formulation of quantum theory never accepted the 'Copen- hagen Interpretation', as it came to be known. The most notable of these was Einstein, who engaged Bohr in a long-running debate culminating in the publication of the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) paper in 1935, and Bohr's reply a few months later.2 Einstein never admitted defeat, but Bohr was considered to have won the dispute. The acceptance of Bohr's view virtually ended discussion of the matter in the West, and all the textbooks published up until 1950 followed something like the Copenhagen line.3 In his book The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics, Max Jammer notes that in the early 1950s the 'almost unchallenged monocracy' of the Copenhagen Interpretation in the West began to be disputed. Commenting on the way that 'heterodox interpretations, though often speculative and incomplete, were readily seized upon as altern- atives' to the 'Copenhagen dogma', he observes that 'the extent to which this process was fomented by social-cultural and political factors such as growing interest in Marxist ideology in the West deserves to be investigated'.4 Since the great majority of those in- volved were Marxists, who were drawing on the resources of an existing debate in the USSR, one cannot but agree with this sug- gestion. This paper argues that, to a large extent, the renewed interest in the interpretation of quantum theory after World War II can be attributed more-or-less directly to the effects of the ideological cam- paign against bourgeois influences on Soviet culture which began with A. A. Zhdanov's much publicized speech in 1947. This speech in- itiated a vigorous campaign against 'bourgeois atomic physics' in the USSR, which was quickly taken up by Marxists in the West. The structure of the paper is as follows. The first section gives a brief outline of dialectical materialism, and of those aspects of quan- tum theory that were said to have precipitated the 'crisis in physics' in the 1930s. The pre-War discussions in the USSR are reasonably well documented and are not covered in detail. The second section ex- amines, again briefly, the immediate impact of Zhdanov's speech and the re-interpretations of quantum theory in the USSR that followed it. In the third section, the 'hidden variables' interpretation of David</page><page sequence="3">Cross: The Crisis in Physics 737 Bohm is placed within the historical context of the Soviet 'crisis in physics' and, in the fourth section, responses to it from the 'Copen- hagen School' are considered. This examination of the opening up of debate in the West is developed in the fifth section. Particular em- phasis is placed on the discussions which took place in France, as these throw a good deal of light on the styles of argument used. The sixth section considers the effects of the end of Stalinism on these discussions. The Pre-War 'Crisis in Physics' As in the West, the interpretation of quantum theory was much discussed in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s. At the same time, the foundations of a unified ideology for the first socialist state were being laid under Stalin's regime.5 This gave a particular focus to the discussions as the Party philosophers sought to extend their influence into all areas of culture, including physics, and one im- portant aspect of this was the development of the concept of a 'socialist' science distinct from bourgeois Western science. The 'new' Party philosophers of the 1930s were limited to what was essentially the Leninist position on epistemology, as set out in Materialism and Empirio-Criticism and later in the Philosophical Notebooks.6 The first of these was the text most frequently used in defining the 'dialectical materialist' philosophy to which a 'socialist' or 'proletarian' science would conform. The dialectical materialist worldview, as expounded by Lenin, can be summarized as follows.7 The world is objectively existing matter forming a complex, interconnected unity. The mode of existence of matter is motion so, since the world is in a state of constant flux, there are no entities which may be described as truly static. Changes in matter occur according to regularities, or 'laws'. These laws exist on different levels corresponding to the domains of the different sciences, and it is not always possible to reduce the laws of phenomena on one level to those of phenomena on another (for example, reducing biology or sociology to physics). Matter has an infinite number of qualities and properties - it is 'inexhaustible'.! It follows that Man's knowledge, which is a 'reflection' in the mind of objective matter, is necessarily provisional and incomplete. Thus the increase of know- ledge is by an accumulation of relative, rather than absolute truths. The limits of what can be known at any one time are historically</page><page sequence="4">738 Social Studies of Science conditioned, but the existence of absolute truth is unconditional. The 'criterion of practice' the success or failure of our interventions in the world, shows whether our conceptions of it are adequate or not. In Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, Lenin argued that the Machian or 'Empirio-Criticist' school in Soviet Philosophy had re- jected Materialism in favour of anti-scientific idealism as a result of a mistaken view of the breakdown of nineteenth-century classical physics.9 Lenin's view was that this breakdown occurred because classical physics was rooted in 'metaphysics' rather than dialectical materialism, particularly in its dependence on a mechanical con- ception of causality. The physicists, however, in their ignorance of dialectics, had erroneously identified mechanism with materialism in general, and thus had rejected materialism and had strayed into 'physical idealism'. Lenin referred to this state of affairs as the 'crisis in modern physics'."' Lenin's emphasis on physics, and the ferment in physical theory in the 1920s and 1930s, ensured that the new devel- opments in physics became the centre of philosophical attention. It was widely suggested that quantum theory and relativity generated the strongest threat to Leninist epistemology." Three crucial aspects of quantum theoretical orthodoxy were seized upon by its critics. The first was Born's interpretation of the wave-function as a description, not of the system to which it cor- responded, but of knowledge about the system. This was viewed as anthropomorphic and idealistic in its disregard of the system as mind- independent matter. Born also claimed that the wave-function con- tained all possible information about the system which, as the wave- function only gave probabilities of different states, rather than exact answers, ruled out any possibility of a deeper causal explanation of the probabilities. The second point of contention was the implication that the statistical character of the theory was a consequence of human intervention rather than an objective feature of nature this being expressed in the early interpretation of the Uncertainty Rela- tions as due to an 'uncontrollable interaction' in the measurement process. This was censured as an arbitrary limitation on the possible extent of human knowledge. Bohr's post-EPR formulation of 'com- plementarity' was no better from this point of view, and it provided a third target for criticism. According to this later version, 'uncertainty' arose from the limited applicability of various mutually contra- dictory classical concepts such as wave and particle descriptions, and causality and space-time coordination. These contradictory or 'complementary' properties were reconciled by attributing existence</page><page sequence="5">Cross: The Crisis in Physics 739 to them only during the measurement process. This reluctance to talk in terms of matter independent of the observer, and the rejection of the idea of a reality that could be modelled unambiguously, were widely condemned as examples of the 'physical idealism' that was part of a broader attack on socialism.'2 Antipathy towards the Copenhagen Interpretation amongst Party philosophers was increased by the attempts of Bohr and others to extend the scope of complementarity to other sciences, and to ethical and social concepts. Keen to validate their role in the fight against bourgeois thought, many philosophers argued for making 'the sci- entific definition of physical reality a corollary of the philosophical definition of physical reality'.'3 This view itself derived from the principle that good science could not be produced by physicists under a capitalist regime, since their bourgeois outlook would inevitably taint their work.'4 Only under socialism, and guided by materialist philosophers, would science flourish. No official position was taken on the matter, however, and Lenin's pronouncements were applied in different ways, leading to a variety of positions ranging from rejection of quantum mechanics in its entirety to support for the Copenhagen view. Most physicists supported Bohr, and an influential group com- prising V. A. Fock, M. P. Bronshtein, L. D. Landau and I. E. Tamm became known as the 'Russian branch' of the Copenhagen School.'5 A campaign to dismiss them was inaugurated, but lacking any official backing, it came to nothing.'6 Quite clearly, this early phase of the dispute grew little beyond its roots in ideological empire-building. It began as an attempt by Party philosophers to establish their authority in the scientific realm, but they had insufficient power to gain ascendancy over those physicists who resisted such interference. While scientists retained their au- tonomy and philosophers failed to agree amongst themselves, no consensus was possible. Only with the advent of a fully-fledged Stalinist ideology in the post-War years was a unity of philosophy and natural science more nearly achieved. The Post-War 'Crisis in Physics' The most significant event for Soviet intellectuals in the years im- mediately after World War II was A. A. Zhdanov's speech, made on 24 June 1947 during the discussion of G. F. Aleksandrov's History of Western European Philosophy.'7 Only one sentence referred directly</page><page sequence="6">740 Social Studies of Science to quantum mechanics -'The Kantian distortions of modern bour- geois atomic physicists led to theoretical conclusions about the elec- tron's freedom of will, they led to the attempt to demonstrate matter only as a certain ensemble of waves, and to other devilment'.'8 It marked, however, the beginning of an intense ideological campaign which had a profound effect on Soviet science, including the inter- pretation of quantum theory. A discussion in the journal Problems of Philosophy initiated by the pro-Copenhagen physicist M. A. Markov led to the sacking of the editor, B. Kedrov.'9 The reformed editorial board unreservedly con- demned Markov's article as veering away from materialism towards idealism. The major consequence of the 'Markov affair' was the outlawing of complementarity in the Soviet Union from 1947 until about 1958. The 1947 meeting of the Academy of Sciences decided that any acceptable interpretation of quantum theory would assert the objective reality of quantum particles, and would show that the statistical nature of the theory could be understood material- istically.20 Among those who responded, willingly or unwillingly, to the demand for a materialistic quantum theory were D. I. Blokhintsev and A. D. Aleksandrov, who favoured 'statistical' interpretations; V. A. Fock, who defended a somewhat modified Copenhagen view; and Ta. P. Terletskii, whose 'hidden variables' theory was very similar to that of David Bohm, discussed below. As the major proponents of their respective interpretations, the positions of Blokhintsev and Fock warrant a brief discussion. According to the usual interpretation, the wave-function gives a complete description of what can be known about the system to which it corresponds. In his 1944 textbook of quantum mechanics, Blokhintsev accepted this view, but in the second edition of 1949 rejected it, arguing instead that the wave-function provided an ob- jective description.2' His new approach was based on the concept that the wave-function referred not to individual systems but only to 'ensembles' of identically prepared systems. The justification for this was that deriving the probabilities of different states by repeated measurements on one system was equivalent to making one meas- urement each on a number of identical systems. The measurement process would alter the initial 'pure' ensemble to a 'mixed' ensemble composed of sub-ensembles, each characterized by a different wave- function, thus giving the spread of values expressed in the Heisenberg relations. The question of which system went into which sub-en-</page><page sequence="7">Cross: The Crisis in Physics 741 semble would not arise, the wave-function being inapplicable to individual systems, thus no limitation on knowledge about an in- dividual system was implied. As a result, the statistical nature of the theory could be regarded as expressing a feature of nature rather than being a product of the measurement process - a vital distinction in deciding whether the theory was 'idealistic' or not. Like most of those who upheld statistical interpretations, Blok- hintsev accepted that the probabilities might be explicable in terms of a deeper 'hidden variables' theory of individual systems - a view contradicting Born's claim that the wave-function's description was complete. He believed that the value of such a theory was, however, a matter to be settled by future experimental research. This, again, was a typical viewpoint. It was this issue of the completeness of quantum theory that proved most controversial amongst those who opposed the Copenhagen view. The statistical interpretation allowed for a more complete description but did not demand it, whereas 'hidden variables' interpretations did presuppose a deeper level of reality. The arguments concerning the legitimacy of this approach are discussed below. Vladimir Fock defended what was essentially Bohr's position, but in its minimum claims only. In the 1930s, he had been amongst the most committed defenders of the Copenhagen Interpretation, and even in the 1950s, when he was subjected to much criticism, showed little inclination to modify his position. He did, however, make revisions in his terminology and censured Bohr for some vagueness in this area. He retreated from the position that complementarity was an objective law of nature implied by the Uncertainty Relations, main- taining on the contrary that Bohr's extension of his concept such that it became a 'universal principle ... applicable in all sciences' was such a blurring of its original meaning that 'it would be better to abandon it' 22 Bohr's rejection of causality was also criticized as inexact term- inology, Fock taking the view that causality was no more than a general statement of the existence of laws of nature.23 Like Blokhintsev, Fock attempted to present the wave-function as a characterization of an objective state but, following Bohr, main- tained that it referred to individual systems. He argued that the wave- function described observer-independent 'potential possibilities', one of which was 'actualized' as an objective state when a measurement was made. Thus he took the controversial step of extending mat- erialism to potential situations. But, despite his concessions to the highly materialistic post-War understanding of dialectical material-</page><page sequence="8">742 Social Studies of Science ism, Fock's position remained out of favour, and much criticized, until the late 1950s, and it was Blokhintsev's statistical interpretation that gained official backing. It would be fair to say that the official acceptance of Blokhintsev's interpretation in the USSR in the early 1950s was the closest that the 'crisis in physics' came to a resolution, albeit a resolution achieved by the exercise of political power. It is apparent that the agreement on interpretation decided by the Academy of Sciences did not reflect any similar consensus among physicists themselves, many of whom, like Fock, continued to support Bohr's views, albeit quietly. The broader Soviet understanding of the relationship between science and ideology was changing, however, as it became apparent that the need to emulate Western technological advances (such as those in nuclear weapons) militated against a continuation of the scientific isolationism of the pre-War years. Though this shift was not fully articulated until after Stalin's death, it was becoming increas- ingly acceptable before that time to approve the work of scientists under bourgeois regimes. A consequence of this was that it became relevant to consider contributions to the 'crisis in physics' debate from outside the Soviet Union. 'Hidden Variables' and Dialectical Materialism The American physicist David Bohm's 'hidden variables' or 'causal' interpretation, though it did not gain the endorsement accorded the 'ensemble' interpretation, was favourably received in official Soviet quarters. Bohm never referred directly to any wish to formulate an interpretation of quantum mechanics consistent with Leninist epi- stemology, but the circumstantial evidence that this was his intention is fairly strong. There is no doubt concerning Bohm's sympathies with the Left. His political affiliations were known to US security officers in 1943, when a transfer from the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley to work with his mentor, J. R. Oppenheimer, on the A-bomb project at Los Alamos was blocked.24 Bohm was asked to appear before the Congressional Un-American Affairs Committee in 1949. When it was alleged that he was a member of the Communist Party he pleaded the Fifth Amend- ment and was indicted for contempt of Congress. Despite eventually being acquitted, he lost his position at Princeton and, having been unable to find another in the US, left the country for good in 1951.25</page><page sequence="9">Cross: The Crisis in Physics 743 Where Bohm writes of the inspiration behind his interpretation, he tends to refer to his failure to 'really understand' the orthodox theory as the main source of his dissatisfaction with it.26 In a communication to Max Jammer, however, he also mentions an essay 'probably by Blokhintsev or some other Russian theorist like Terletskii' criticizing Bohr's approach, which he read before formulating his own theory.27 In 1957, he commented that the 'systematic tendency to question the usual interpretation' which began 'about 1950' owed much to these two theorists.28 In his 1951 textbook, Bohm defended a position almost identical to that of Bohr.29 In his 1952 interpretation, however, he departed from the Copenhagen view altogether.30 His new approach was a theory that reproduced the predictions of the orthodox theory whilst postu- lating a well-defined trajectory for individual particles. The trajectory was in principle knowable, but in practice remained 'hidden'. He hoped that experimental investigations into domains in which quan- tum field theory was facing difficulties - dimensions in the order of the size of the nucleus and high-energy reactions - and the devel- opment of new experimental techniques might reveal more about a 'sub-quantum level' not governed by the Uncertainty Relations. At the quantum level, Bohm's interpretation coincided with the sta- tistical interpretation and thus preserved the advantages, from the materialist point of view, of this interpretation. Moreover, the deeper sub-quantum theory provided an account of individual particles and introduced a more deterministic form of causality.3' Mechanical determinism of the type condemned by Engels and Lenin was avoided by treating causal and statistical laws as abstractions from the unity of the world that emerged on different 'levels' of scientific description. This idea of 'levels' of reality constituting a 'qualitative infinity of nature' was widely regarded as consistent with dialectical mater- ialism.32 Bohm's philosophical position was most clearly set out in his book Causality and Chance in Modern Physics.33 In its most im- portant features it matched very closely the dialectical materialist view, though no explicit reference to this philosophy was made. In the book, Bohm criticized the 'philosophical point of view containing various branches such as "positivism", "operationalism", "empiri- cism" and others' without naming this view 'idealism'; gave examples of quantitative change leading to qualitative change without mention- ing 'dialectics'; and argued for the existence of a mind-independent atomic domain without referring to 'materialism'.34 Such reticence</page><page sequence="10">744 Social Studies of Science was consistent with his aim of gaining acceptance for his new ap- proach to quantum theory from physicists in general. For most, its consistency with dialectical materialism would at the very least be irrelevant, and would more likely discourage them from considering it. Nevertheless, his work was widely read as an attempt to formulate a materialistic theory of atomic processes. With a few exceptions, all those who preferred Bohm's inter- pretation, or even took an interest in it, were Marxists. This is not surprising as, outside its ideological framework, Bohm's interpreta- tion could only appeal to those who had other reasons than Marxism for rejecting acausality. As its critics were quick to point out it was experimentally indistinguishable from orthodox quantum mech- anics, and thus of little value scientifically. Bohm's only possible response was to argue that it was a path worth following as it might later yield results which could be used to decide between it and the orthodox approach. This was insufficient to persuade those who had no opposition to Bohr's view, or even some, like Einstein and Schrodinger, who did. Complementarity and Dialectical Materialism The attitude of the Copenhagen School in general to Bohm's inter- pretation has been discussed elsewhere for example by Trevor Pinch and by Max Jammer.35 As might have been expected, the reaction was wholly negative. Interestingly, the two fiercest op- ponents of any attempt to supplant the Copenhagen Interpretation Vladimir Fock and Leon Rosenfeld were also Marxists, and it is to their arguments I now turn. The difficulties of Fock's position, in particular his continued ad- herence to a view of the relationship between science and philosophy that was unfashionable in the Soviet Union, did not discourage him from making trenchant criticisms of Blokhintsev and Bohm. He argued that both the 'ensemble' and 'causal' interpretations were physically flawed and philosophically mistaken, their existence being due to misinterpretations of dialectical materialism. It was the central point in Blokhintsev's interpretation the definition of the ensemble - that was attacked as inadequate. Fock shrewdly used the language of his own critics to undermine its philosophical basis:</page><page sequence="11">Cross: The Crisis in Physics 745 In contrast to what dialectical materialism teaches us, the statistical point of view issues not from the objects of nature but from observations.... This draws it towards the positivist point of view of Bohr, which also denies that the wave- function relates to the micro-object, and attributes to the wave-function only a purely symbolic significance."6 Fock also used the language of Leninist orthodoxy in criticizing the 'causal' interpretation. He claimed that, in merely reinterpreting the existing theory, Bohm had concerned himself only with reconciling 'a priori ideas with results already known from quantum mechanics. The criterion of practice therefore speaks decisively against this scientific trend'.37 (The failure of the 'causal interpretation' to provide new experimental results was a recurring theme amongst its critics.) Like some other Marxist critics, Fock censured Bohm's attempt to re- introduce a classical form of causality as a return to anti-dialectical mechanism. The vigour with which Leon Rosenfeld defended the Copenhagen interpretation was second to none and, as an ex-member of the Communist Party living in the West, he did not share Fock's need to deliberate on his choice of words or to join him in denouncing Bohr. In fact, Rosenfeld's loyalty to Bohr led to another member of the Copenhagen School taking the blame for undermining com- plementarity's claim to be materialistic: Are we going to lay complementarity under an interdict because Heisenberg is an idealist? . . . Bohr is too subtle a dialectician to fall into the same inconsistency as Heisenberg.3" Rosenfeld's broadsides against unorthodoxy in atomic physics aimed particularly at Bohm -were part of a wider attack on Stalin- ism in general, which he considered to be the 'dialectical negation' of the idea of Marx and Engels.39 The responsibility for this philo- sophical inadequacy was traced back beyond Stalin, however: The prevailing muddle between mechanistic and scientific materialism may be traced back to Lenin ... [who], while no doubt intending to follow Engels, in effect advocated mechanistic materialism, with its metaphysical conception of determinism.40 Rosenfeld regarded the concept of complementarity as a dialectical synthesis arising out of the contradiction of wave and particle de- scriptions of matter.4' This emphasized dialectic more than mat-</page><page sequence="12">746 Social Studies of Science erialism, and it was the 'causal' interpretation, which he regarded as mechanistic, towards which he directed most of his invective: It is a cruel irony of fate that physicists who believe themselves the guardians of the Marxist tradition should be blind to . . . a momentous dialectical development and oppose to it the most outworn metaphysical preconceptions. Having failed in the attempt to uphold determinism in quantum theory they are now trying to argue that one ought to consider a kind of hybrid causality, partaking in some confused way of both determinism and chance.... They are thus driven to a frantic chase of determinism into an infinite sequence of deeper and deeper levels of reality: a purely imaginative construction, as ingenious and misguided as those of medieval scholasticism.42 The 'Crisis in Physics' in the West Fierce criticism did little to prevent the ideas of Blokhintsev and Bohm being taken up more widely in the West, for reasons that the Copenhagen School were quick to perceive. Heisenberg identified the dissatisfaction of those who 'in recent years. . . have taken their stand against the "orthodox" interpretation' with a desire to 'rescue materialistic ontology'.43 Born, too, observed that 'the opponents are mainly representatives of political ideologies whose resistance to the new concepts ... of reality and causality due to quantum theory derives from dogmatic prejudices', adding that 'this would be of no consequence were not dialectical materialism a kind of National Religion in the Eastern countries'.44 The new interpretations most frequently discussed in the West, for example in the articles of Heisenberg and Rosenfeld cited above and in review articles like those of Mario Bunge and Hans Freistadt, were those of Bohm, J.-P. Vigier, I. Fenyes, L. Janossy, Blokhintsev, Ia. Frenkel', Terletskii and A. D. Aleksandrov.45 These new approaches also led to a renewal of interest in the work of those like H. Margenau and A. Lande, and in the general objections to complementarity from Einstein, Schrodinger and others which predated the 'crisis in phy- sics' of the 1950s. The Soviet physicists and Bohm have been discussed above. Vigier was a member of the French Communist Party (PCF). Fenyes and Janossy were both Hungarian. Janossy, in particular, was singled out for praise in Soviet journals for his work in furthering interest in dialectical materialism outside the USSR.46 Freistadt and Bunge were themselves involved more directly as two</page><page sequence="13">Cross: The Crisis in Physics 747 of the chief proponents of the 'causal' interpretation outside France and the USSR. Freistadt, like Bohm, drew the attention of the US anti-Communist movement in 1949, but managed to keep his job.47 He was among the first to support Bohm's interpretation, and argued its merits in articles in the independent Marxist journal Science and Society and in Philosophy of Science.48 In two papers in Physical Review, he extended the 'hidden variables' approach to field theory.49 Bunge had criticized indeterminism in quantum theory before Bohm published his interpretation, and later defended Bohm against Rosenfeld.50 Both Freistadt and Bunge published comprehensive review articles on the various interpretations of quantum mechanics, but failed to stir up much interest in the USA. American physicists appeared largely indifferent to the philosophy of the theory, and those who were Communists had other, more pressing, concerns such as persecution and the implications of the A-bomb and H-bomb programmes. The circumstances in France were very different. The PCF was suffering less from McCarthy style 'witch-hunts', and for historical reasons was always strong in physical scientists. A purge of the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique did occur in 1950-51, and it is estimated that 65% of its personnel were Party members. Two factors were particularly important in driving French physicists towards Communism. The first was the influence of the group of politically progressive scientists of the previous generation, which included Paul Langevin, the Curies, Jean Perrin, and Eugenie and Aime Cotton. The second was a tendency to equate Soviet patronage of science with 'Marxism'. French science was notoriously underfunded.5' The 'crisis in physics' was debated in France far more widely and with more vigour than in any other Western country, though, never- theless, in an almost exclusively Marxist context. As in the Soviet Union, criticism of the orthodox interpretation of quantum mech- anics began very soon after its inception due largely to the eminent French physicist Paul Langevin. His treatise 'La Notion de Cor- puscles et d'Atomes', first published in 1934, was widely read, and was frequently quoted in the discussions of the 1950s.52 In it, he criticized complementarity as a mere acceptance of a dialectical negation rather than a true synthesis, and proposed instead a stat- istical interpretation much like that expounded later by Blokhintsev. His son-in-law, Jacques Solomon, outlined similar ideas in two papers in the Marxist journal La Pensee (of which Langevin was co-editor), and in his book Protons, Neutrons, Neutrinos.53</page><page sequence="14">748 Social Studies of Science Again, as in the USSR, it was only with the Soviet Party inter- vention in 1947 that the 'crisis in physics' was established as a major concern for Communist physicists in France. Within two years of the 'Zhdanovischina', criticism of the orthodox theory began to be re- newed. The Fock-Blokhintsev controversy and, later, Bohm's 'causal' interpretation created enough interest to maintain a long- running debate in the two major Marxist journals, La Nouvelle Critique and La Pense'e. Papers such as those by G. Vassails brought the discussions in the USSR to the notice of French Communists, and in 1952 La Nouvelle Critique published a volume of translations of some of the earlier Soviet articles.54 The first laudatory review of Bohm's work was published in La Pense'e in 1952.55 The author, Evry Schatzman, observed that Bohm and Langevin, along with Soviet physicists, had demonstrated that quantum theory could be interpreted in such a way as to represent objective reality rather than just 'observations'. Among the different ways in which this had been done, Schatzman's own sympathies lay with Bohm's approach, which he described as a 'decisive progress'. The first physicist to take up Bohm's theory and develop it, both in collaboration with Bohm and later independently, was J. -P. Vigier. Vigier maintained that Bohm's interpretation and the non-linear quantum theory to be developed from it were preferable, both ideo- logically and physically, to the usual linear theory.56 The 'causal' interpretation was, he claimed, thoroughly materialistic and con- sistent with the pronouncements of the 1947 meeting of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Though he accepted that this could also be said of the 'ensemble' interpretation, he expressed the view that the latter, being merely a re-interpretation, was insufficiently radical to cope with the mathematical difficulties such as 'divergences' with which quantum field theory was beset at this time. Vigier, Bohm and Terletskii treated their interpretation as the point of departure for a fully-fledged non-linear theory of individual particles which would have experimental implications beyond those of the usual theory, and whichr could thus be vindicated experimentally. Vigier had become acquainted with Bohm's work before it was published, as he was at the time working with Louis de Broglie, to whom Bohm had sent a preprint of his first 1952 paper. Bohm's interpretation was almost identical to one that de Broglie himself had developed in the 1920s, but had been persuaded by Pauli to abandon in 1927. Prompted by Vigier, de Broglie took up his old ideas again, and thus France's most famous physicist became an adherent of the</page><page sequence="15">Cross: The Crisis in Physics 749 'causal' interpretation - an event which further stirred up debate among French Communists and physicists.57 Reactions to Vigier's forceful advocacy of the 'causal' interpre- tation were mixed. One trend in Western Communist thought was apparent in E. Cotton's opinion that whilst the work of Bohm, Vigier, Janossy and 'notre grand' Langevin was praiseworthy, its real value was in directing attention to the discussions in the USSR, since truly materialistic science could be produced only under a socialist regime.58 Most French Communist scientists were not inclined to accept in its entirety the view that scientific theories formulated under capitalism would necessarily be inherently bourgeois, as had been suggested by Zhdanov. To a greater or lesser extent they tried to maintain a distinction between the content of science and the cir- cumstances of its production, a view which was already gaining ground in the USSR. F. Lursat was more concerned with the physical than ideological aspects when he pointed out that Blokhintsev's and Vigier's in- terpretations were experimentally indistinguishable from each other, and from the orthodox interpretation.59 He accepted that a mat- erialistic interpretation was to be preferred, but which it was to be could not be settled scientifically. This reluctance to take a definite position was criticized by F. Fer, who took the view that the defence of determinism in physics could be equated with the defence of Marxism in political economics, and should be pursued with equal vigour. Vigier's approach was deterministic and materialistic, Fer argued, and Marxists should therefore support it.60 In reply, Lur9at reiterated that it was too early to comment on the scientific value of Vigier's work, and that only its philosophical value could be assessed. He stressed that it was important to distinguish the physics of the theory from the idealistic philosophy of some physicists, arguing that the empirical success of quantum mechanics militated against the suggestion that the theory was wholly idealistic.6" Vigier's own po- sition lent some weight to this view as he, like Bohm, treated their re- interpretation as a starting point from which to generate results different from those oI the orthouox tneory. Like Lur9at, J. Joyeux rejected the idea of a separate socialist science and likewise regarded the role of Marxism in science as generalizing its results rather than refuting this or that theory.62 He went further than Lur9at in also rejecting the need for a 'causal interpretation'.63 He noted that the supporters of the Bohm-Vigier- de Broglie approach were still in the minority, and that there were</page><page sequence="16">750 Social Studies of Science serious problems with the concepts of the 'quantum potential' and of the field in Bohm's theory. It was the ideological basis that most concerned him, however. Like others (including Bohr, Heisenberg and Rosenfeld), Joyeux regarded the 'causal interpretation' as no more than a change of vocabulary, and claimed that its proponents lacked a correct critical evaluation of quantum theory. He suggested that it was bourgeois to talk of each new discovery creating a 'crisis in physics' - quantum mechanics was clearly successful and, as Lenin had observed, experience should be decisive in testing our ideas about the world. Joyeux's view was rejected by F. Halbwachs who, in his response, suggested that Joyeux had confused the supporters of the 'causal' interpretation with those in the Party who had advocated a distinct 'proletarian' or 'socialist' science in the 1940s.' Halbwachs accepted that this view was outdated, but maintained that the Party should continue to uphold a position on science, as it did on philosophy and economics. He claimed that to oppose this, and to oppose Vigier's position in these terms, was positivistic. The interest expressed in the interpretation of quantum mechanics in France did not go unnoticed in the USSR, and Soviet responses, noting the diversity of opinion in France, were published in La Nouvelle Critique and La Pensee.65 Also, in a departure from the isolationism of previous years, in 1955 the Soviet Academy of Sci- ences published a collection of papers by Western physicists to acquaint scientists in the USSR with their work.66 In 1957, La Nou- velle Critique published a similar collection of predominantly Soviet papers, as it had in 1952.67 As the debate continued in the two French journals, there were no indications of any convergence in opinion. La Pensee responded by publishing a paper by Halbwachs, which defended Vigier's con- tribution as 'a great victory for materialistic physics', and one by the Soviet physicist G. A. Svetchnikov.68 Svetchnikov noted the division in France among those like Cotton, Vassails and Charles, who fol- lowed Blokhintsev, and those such as Vigier, Schatzman and Regnier, who followed Bohm. The latter group, in particular Vigier, were criticized for being insufficiently thorough in exposing mechanism - in other words, being too mechanistic themselves. Those who supported the statistical interpretation were praised for their correct application of dialectical materialism in science. Vigier responded to such criticisms by once again emphasizing the preliminary nature of his first attempt at a new interpretation, and stressed the need for</page><page sequence="17">Cross: The Crisis in Physics 751 qualitatively new (and presumably less mechanistic) concepts in a fully-fledged theory.69 The 'Crisis in Physics' After Stalin The political upheavals of 1956 made their mark on the discussions of quantum theory. Khruschev's denunciation of Stalin at the Twen- tieth Party Congress, and the invasion of Hungary by the USSR to suppress a revolt a few months later, precipitated a substantial exodus from Communist Parties in the West and caused a general crisis in Marxist thought.70 Up until this time, Western Communists had been content to follow the Soviet line the PCF, in particular, had a reputation for being 'unrepentantly Stalinist'.71 With the renun- ciation in the USSR of many Stalinist policies, those who remained in their Parties were left with the problems of how to interpret the Stalin era and, indeed, how to interpret Marxism. The PCF reacted less strongly than most Communist Parties and managed to retain a fair degree of unity, though de Gaulle posed a third and, perhaps, more serious long-term threat to its influence in French politics.72 The PCF did, however, expel H. Lefebvre its most distinguished philosopher and sociologist in 1958. His strongly anti-Stalin Problmes Actuels de Marxisme had included a rejection of the Marxist critique of quantum mechanics.73 One important aspect of 'de-Stalinization' in Soviet science was the programme of assimilating, as rapidly as possible, Western scientific and technological ideas.74 The move from identifying 'wrong science' with 'wrong ideology' to separating 'good science' from 'bad ideol- ogy' meant an end to the concept of a separate 'socialist' science. The relaxation of ideological restraints of which this was a part meant that, by the late 1950s, all sorts of philosophies, from existentialism to positivism, were being camouflaged under dialectical materialism.75 This increased freedom did not immediately lead to widespread acceptance of the Copenhagen Interpretation, and desnite Fock's reports that Bohr had modified his views they were not fully endorsed at the 1958 meeting of the Academy of Science.76 By the time Bohr visited the USSR in 1961, however, they had gained approval.77 The effects of de-Stalinization in changing perceptions of the 'crisis in physics' in France are apparent in two articles by E. Cotton and F. Lur9at, which appeared in La Nouvelle Critique after its editorial upheaval of November 1957. Both authors echoed the Soviet re-</page><page sequence="18">752 Social Studies of Science jection of scientific isolationism and made a corresponding attempt to establish dialectical materialism as a generalization of all scientific theory. Cotton began by re-affirming his commitment to dialectical mat- erialism as formulated by Engels and Lenin, and claimed that it had been vindicated by all the recent developments in physics.78 A re- statement of the basic materialist position was followed by a dis- cussion of the 'confusion' concerning the role of dialectical mat- erialism in science an attempt to resolve the major differences in opinion that had characterized the debate over quantum theory. The idea that particular scientific theories were bourgeois was firmly rejected, Cotton arguing that it was an error to suggest that a wrong ideology would necessarily lead to wrong science, and he censured Zhdanov for promoting this view. Cotton identified the sources of idealism in some presentations of modern physics not as being in bourgeois social conceptions, but in the difficulties in understanding the new phenomena involved. Interpretative problems in physics, therefore, originated in physics and not in ideology. Cotton's arguments were elaborated further by Lur9at. He des- cribed Cotton's article as most encouraging compared with the in- ternal 'School' quarrels of earlier contributions in that it showed how dialectical materialism was 'confirmed and enriched' by science in general.79 Lur9at developed this theme by taking specific examples from recent physics and demonstrating how they confirmed the fundamentals of dialectical materialism the primacy, objectivity, inexhaustibility and indestructibility of matter, with movement as its mode of existence, and the laws of dialectics. Like Cotton, Lur9at expressed doubts as to whether the major changes in quantum theory proposed by Vigier and Bohm were really necessary and suggested that, whilst idealistic interpretations of the- ories were possible, all science, including quantum mechanics, con- firmed materialism.80 The retreat from the notion of 'crisis in physics' characterized by Cotton's and Lur9at's papers was the beginning of the end of the debate. The claim that all science confirmed materialism paralleled the Soviet shift from the concept of a distinct 'socialist' science. This did not so much resolve the 'crisis' as deny its existence. By the 1960s, it had ceased to be a matter worth discussing.</page><page sequence="19">Cross: The Crisis in Physics 753 Conclusion One of the more striking aspects of the 'crisis in physics' is the effort that was required to generate it. With such a wide range of inter- pretative possibilities open in understanding both 'complementarity' and dialectical materialism, there can be no suggestion that there was necessarily a contradiction between the two. In the 1930s, it suited the Soviet Party philosophers to propose that there was, though as to exactly where the contradiction lay they were rather vague. It suited most Soviet physicists to deny any such clash. They were free to ignore the challenge and chose to do so, their critics lacking the power to force a response. The position was rather different after the War, when the issue was re-opened with an official pronouncement of what the problem was, and what an acceptable solution would have to affirm. The debate thereby gained what it had previously lacked - a definitive statement of how materialism conflicted with quantum theory, and the power to demand a response from the scientific community. This power was simply the ability to get a pro-Bohr physicist sacked (or worse). From the official Party point of view, the 'crisis in physics', therefore, lasted only a couple of years - from Zhdanov's speech to the acceptance by the Academy of Science of Blokhintsev's statistical interpretation. For David Bohm, the Soviet position was of no help in gaining acceptance amongst physicists in general for his 'hidden variables' interpretation. It might be argued that only his standing as a physicist enabled him to get any sort of hearing at all. Most chose to ignore it. Amongst the few who referred to it, the criticisms were always the same - there were no difficulties with quantum theory, and all Bohm had done was re-interpret it in a way that was experimentally in- distinguishable from the standard theory. Bohm was well aware that experiment was the crucial issue, but could do no more than offer the hope that at some later date his interpretation might lead to results different from those suggested by the usual theory. As things stood, though, it was unnecessary for orthodoxy to defend itself, and Bohm was left to continue his programme out of the mainstream of physics. The debate amongst French Communist physicists again exemp- lifies the difficulty of gaining consensus on interpretation. The PCF largely followed the Soviet line in objecting to the Copenhagen Interpretation, but failed to agree on an alternative. Some, like J. Joyeux, rejected the critique of quantum theory altogether, whilst at the other extreme was the belief that Western views were inherently</page><page sequence="20">754 Social Studies of Science bourgeois and only the Soviet theorizing was of consequence. Some measure of agreement was reached only when the debate was over- taken by events and became irrelevant. Outside the PCF, it never even got started. Thus the 'crisis in physics' ended in three different ways. In the USSR, it was settled by the Communist Party deciding on an in- terpretation, though within a few years, as the Soviet view of science changed, that position drifted to an acceptance of an apparently reformed Bohr. In the West, the notion of a 'crisis' was not accepted and dissenters were marginalized. Communists in the West did not find a consensus until changing circumstances rendered the debate futile. The characteristic which distinguishes the 'crisis in physics' from most other case studies is that the protagonists were unable to appeal to experiment or the mathematics of the theory in any other than a rhetorical way to support their positions.8' This no doubt made resolution difficult. There are many case studies in the sociology of science which show that resolution is by no means straightforward when experimental data or proofs are central to the dispute, which raises the question as to whether there is any fundamental difference between disputes where the usual vocabulary of scientific discourse is available, and those where it is not. This is really a matter for further research, but I suspect that a starting point for locating a possible distinction might be in studying which sorts of problem scientists feel require solution, and which problems they feel do not. In my ex- perience, scientists (in the physical sciences at least) are inclined to regard debates like those concerning the 'foundations of quantum theory' as philosophical rather than scientific, the implication being that they can ignore them if they choose, just as many atomic physicists ignored the 'crisis in physics'.82 0 NO TES The author wishes to thank Dr Simon Schaffer of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge, for his assistance and encouragement during the writing of this paper. 1.

The proponents of the statistical and 'causal' interpretations differed on the questions of what sort of causality was consistent with dialectical materialism and what sort of revisions would be required to overcome the problems of quantum field theory.
