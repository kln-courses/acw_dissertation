<plain_text><page sequence="1">Les divinites fluviales GaAga et Yamuna. By ODETTE VIENNOT. Paris: Presses Universi- taires de France, 1964. 2I2. Bibliographie; Plates. $8.oo. In this study of the iconographic representa- tions of the sacred river-divinities, Ganga (Ganges) and Yamuna (Jumna), Odette Vi- ennot, Chargee de Mission au Musee Guimet, continues to explore a problem related to her earlier investigation of tree divinities (vrk!a- devati) in ancient Indian art. This essay on the evolution of a particular decorative theme was partly inspired by Vogel's article on the icono- graphy of these rivers, and less directly by the writings of Ph. Stern and others. The present work surpasses all previous studies relevant to this topic in scope, detail, and comprehensive- ness. Vogel, in particular, developed the thesis that the Ganga could be identified as a deified river by an association with certain motifs, es- pecially the makara. Our author pursued this line of inquiry in two previously published articles, and here lists both major and minor motifs associated with these river-divinities. In general, the Ganga is often represented in tem- ple sculpture by the makara and the Yamuna by the tortoise (kirma), which are the respec- tive vehicles (vahana) of these goddesses. But, further indices can be noted as characterizing the rivers, such as peculiarities of posture or stance, surrounding trees, the parasol, lotus, cushions, and other figures repetitiously associ- ated with the divinities, especially certain at- tendants, groups (gana), and guardians of the temple portals (dvarapala). The "motifs min- eurs" are somewhat less tangible. They include celestial figures (gandharva) and certain birds (e.g., hamsa), anthropomorphic serpents (naga), ritual objects, such as flowers, gar- lands, water-pots (piarnakumbha), and amor- ous couples (mithuna). If a weakness exists at all in this definitive study, it would seem to lie in the rationale which allows these motifs to be employed as specific indications of the repre- sentation of river-divinities. In effect, are these motifs conclusive evidence that specific figures are particular river goddesses? To resolve this question, the author care- fully traces these themes in three successive historical periods of origin (elaboration), de- velopment (maturite), and decline (dead- ence). Each of these periods is further broken down into general terms analyzing the continu- ity of the earliest features, innovations in the theme, summaries, and relative chronologies. Thus, the reader is led step by step through a critical statement of the major characteristics of each period to a relation of those features to subsequent modifications. Line drawings in the body of the text and seventy-six half-tone plates in the appendices serve to illustrate the au- thor's discussion of the various pertinent mo- tifs. The author shows commendable restraint in interpreting these artistic representations sym- bolically. Contrary to the principles of inter- pretation of Indian iconography promulgated by Prof. Stella Kramrisch (e.g., The Hindu Temple, vol. II, p. 3I4 ff.), there is less tend- ency here to understand these rivers as vicari- ous symbols "equivalent to a bath taken in the sacred waters" or to suggest that the doorway, whose lintel they so often adorn as dvJrapdlas, is "an iconostasis of the descent of the Rivers, of Sakti; and of the ascent of life. .. ." On the other hand, there is considerably less relation here of these themes to pertinent, even if often incorrectly associated, literature than Prof. Kramrisch provides. References (e.g., p. 52) to Vdlmiki's Gahgdstotra, gankara's Gahgds- taka, and Kalidasa's Kumarasambhava are mostly fortuitous and inconclusive. While the great Indian epics, the Purianas, and related texts often dilate pictorially on the divine origin of the river Gaiiga in particular, there is relatively little attempt to relate these writ- ten sources to the plastic arts. The most fa- mous carving illustrating this literary theme is, of course, the great bas-relief at Mamal- lapuram. There are other extant graphic rep-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 159 resentations as well which should be the starting point of a correlation of the art and lit- erature. Why, then, should such literal repre- sentations of texts as the "Descent of the Ganges" at Mamallapuram differ from less ex- travagant portrayals of river-divinities as door- guardians? A common weakness of Indian art histories seems to be a lack of textual correla- tion. Our author, while not basing her con- clusions on literary sources, does, however, avoid the other extreme of factious imaginative interpretation. She defines her terms, relates them chronologically, and adheres to sober circumspective, if not always conclusive, argu- ments. Here she is not concerned with the di- vine rivers, but with Ganga and Yamund as anthropomorphic divinities at the doors of In- dian temples. The analysis of the pertinent themes in the three periods constitutes Part I of this study. Part II discusses the spread and diffusion of the river-divinity theme throughout various geo- graphical regions, especially Maharastra, Dak- sina-Kosala, Orissa, North-East India, Kar- nata, Maisiir, and Tamil Nad. Though less pro- vocative than Part I, this section is important particularly because of its critical analysis and comparative consideration of variations of the basic thematic motifs. What Part I does for the historical aspect of the problem, Part II does for the geographical. There is no Part III, but the useful appen- dices and "Annexes" could easily be so desig- nated. Here are included relevant numismatic and epigraphic materials, and a brief statement of recapitulation and conclusion. There is a listing by groups of bas-relief sites and of char- acterization of motifs. A one-page glossary of thirty-two terms is hardly inclusive or even important since all terms are fully defined in the text. The bibliography is quite adequate. There is a table of the line drawings in the text and a list of photographic illustrations. There are also three maps indicating the period of the elaboration and maturation of the theme, the period of decadence, and the diffusion of the theme. A list of sites by village and state, with pertinent references to the body of the text, completes this volume. There are two "rectifi- cations" which alter textual errors in eleven places. This book is one of the best critical re- searches of a particular theme in Indian art. The organization is excellent and systematic. As a scholarly investigation, this study not only meets the highest standards, but in many re- spects defines such standards which Indian art historians should continue to follow. ROYAL W.
