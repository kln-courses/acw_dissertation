Big Kid Science. (Grades K-8) Max Goes to Mars is a rousing suc- cess on many levels. It is a beauti- fully illustrated story book about the first human mission to Mars in which Max (a dog) is a crew mem- ber. Max is the pet of a girl named Tori, and throughout the story she is a strong presence as she explains to Max much of the current state of knowledge about the red planet in language that will be understand- able to a young reader. Of course, the mission is a great success, and Max makes a key contribution. There are many wonderful as- pects to this book.

Its brisk plot is enhanced both by Alan Okamoto's colorful illustrations and by clearly explained scientific information. At no time does au- thor Jeffrey Bennett, an astrophysi- cist and former NASA scientist, talk down to his young audience. He presents abundant and accessible factual material within the context of the plot. Bennett includes 22 "Big Kid Boxes" in the book. In these sec- tions, the interested older reader (teacher) can learn about specific areas of interest, such as the history of animals in space, past and present robotic Mars missions, the reasons for the colors of the Martian sky, and the challenges that will be faced by humans embarking on an expe- dition that will probably occupy several years. There's also a box explaining that Max has clearly dog- like behaviors (such as concentrat- ing on a squirrel behind Toris head as she patiently explains science to him), so the book avoids the trap of anthropomorphism. Max Goes to Mars will serve the elementary classroom both as a good story and as an astronomy reference. Cary Seidman Visit the SAC Archives!
