<plain_text><page sequence="1">Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life* LEWIS WHITE BECK I must confess that I have a singular reason for being gratified at the privilege of delivering this paper as a presidential address -if it were not the presidential address I doubt that it would be accepted by the Program Committee. Our Association is not hospitable to cosmological speculations. I can avail myself only of presidential license in asking you to consider a perennial theme in philosophy which is neglected by philosophers at a time when it is most cherished by scientists. Many eminent phi- losophers-among others Aristotle', Nicholas of Cusa, Giordano Bruno, Gassendi2, Locke3, Lambert4, Kant5, and William Whewell6--have believed that there is extraterrestrial life; yet I know of only one or two living professional philosophers writ- ing in English7 who have even discussed the question. This is unfortunate, since many of the problems our scientific col- leagues are raising, such as those of the criteria of life, mind, intelligence, and language, and the future viability of our civilization, are problems about which we philosophers have much to say. There are new sciences like exobiology whose foundations are in need of philosophical scrutiny.

The belief that there are animate and superhuman beings in- habiting heavenly bodies, or that heavenly bodies are them- selves animate and conscious-it is often difficult to know which -was very widespread in the ancient Mediterranean world. When many of the ancient Greek philosophers9 asserted that the moon, planets, and stars are inhabited, they probably did so without great speculative venturesomeness; it might have been more idiosyncratic to have denied so commonplace a view. Though Aristotle believed that the moon is inhabited, the Aris- totelian teaching of the uniqueness of the world put an end to easy assumptions. The two ancient writings of most interest for our topic are those of Lucretius and Plutarch. That two writers having as little in common as they did came by very different arguments to much the same conclusion suggests that we have here to do with a myth or archetypal idea. Like the idea of God, to which it is not unrelated, the belief that we are not alone appeals on a prephilosophical level where men as different as Plutarch and Lucretius are at one. These two writers set the ground rules for all future speculation on extraterrestrial life. Let it be granted that they did not know even what little we know about the answers to their questions; but they knew the right questions to ask, and their questions and some of their answers have been re- peated again and again. Plutarch's thesis in The Face that is in the Orb of the Moon is that there are, or at least may be, men in the moon. He reaches this conclusion from four premises. (1) The earth has no privi- leged position in the universe (925 E-926 C). (2) The earth and heavenly bodies are not where they should be in accordance with the doctrine of natural positions and movements; hence the matter of the universe has been distributed by an intelli- 8 A Review of Space Research (National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council Publication 1079 [1962]), ch. 9, pp. 2-3. 9 For example, Philolaos (Diels-Kranz [1964], p. 404); Anaxagoras (Kirk and Raven, p. 389); Democritus (ibid., p. 410); Epicurus (Diogenes Laertius, ix, 31); perhaps Anaxi- mander (see Charles Mugler, Devenir cyclique et pluralite des mondes [Paris, 19531); Timaeus 41 E (see also Laws 967). 6</page><page sequence="3">EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENT LIFE gence working by design (926 F- 927 F, 928 C-D). (3) The moon is sufficiently like the earth to support life (937 C-D). (4) If the moon did not support life, it would exist to no purpose, and this is inconsistent with the premise of intelligent design (937 E). From these it is supposed to follow that there are living beings on the moon. Lucretius' De rerum natura was written before Plutarch's dialogue, but it may best be considered as if it were a criticism of it, for Lucretian reactions take place repeatedly against a long line of Plutarchean arguments. Lucretius accepts only two of the four premises of Plutarch's argument, namely the first and the third. There is an infinity of empty space with atoms jostling about, and here and there are "gatherings of matter" (11,1044 ff) some of which are other worlds with their own skies and races of men and beasts (II, 1067 ff) which have originated in natural ways, have undergone divergent natural selection in diverse en- vironments, and have developed diverse civilizations (V, 774 ff). There is no design; the celestial bodies do not exist for the sake of their inhabitants; their inhabitants exist by chance. Lucretius does not stop with the paltry question of whether the moon is sufficiently earth-like to support life; he says that there must be innumerable worlds in all degrees of likeness and unlikeness, and therefore there must be worlds which have inhabitants some like us and some unlike. These speculations by Plutarch and Lucretius set up the ways of arguing for two thousand years. New astronomical and bio- logical information has been repeatedly put into these two forms. The Plutarchean argument became a part of the natural theology of Christianity after the Copernican revolution; the Lucretian argument came into its own after the Darwinian. But no successful elaboration of these promising beginnings, which we cannot help admiring even today, was made for four- teen centuries. St. Augustine exercised his great authority against the plurality of worldsl'; in the eighth century a bishop was removed from office for affirming plurality; and it was for- mally declared heretical in the eleventh." When the teachings of Aristotle were introduced in Paris in the thirteenth century, added weight was given to the dogma of the uniqueness of the world, so much weight indeed that it threatened the dogma of the power of God to go against the natural Aristotelian order.

This was not done in defense of the thesis of an actual plurality, but only in defense of the omnipotence of God. Both Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas Aquinas had already held it to be in the power of God to create more worlds than one, but had de- nied, on good Platonic and Aristotelian ground, that He had in fact done so. 12 While the normal form of teleology in the Middle Ages had been man-centered or God-centered, the doctrine of the plural- ity of worlds based upon Copernicus broadened the teleological framework. While every part of the universe was designed for a purpose or at least had a purpose in the organic and spiritual unity of nature-no one denied that-man and our own earth were no longer seen as the sole purpose. When it was decided that the earth is a planet and the sun a star, the pervasive teleo- logical conviction implied that there are other living beings for whose benefit the planets and stars exist. Nicholas of Cusa drew this Plutarchean inference even before Copernicus. Both he and Bruno rejected the craft-handiwork conception of a teleology of design in favor ot the animistic neo-Platonic principle of the plenitude of being, holding that the perfection of each heavenly body requires that it support spiritual life. "[Other worlds] are not required for the perfection and subsistence of our own world, but . . . for the subsistence and perfection of our universe it- self an infinity of worlds is necessary," wrote Bruno.13 By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the belief had become a commonplace. It was supported sometimes by neo- Platonic, sometimes by deistic, and occasionally by materialistic arguments which followed the Plutarchean or Lucretian para- digms.'1 The most important sources of the received opinion were works of Thomas Wilkins'l, Christian Huyghens16, and 12 Summa theologica I, Quest. 47, art. 3; see also Quest. 70, art. 3. 13 Bruno, Of the Infinite Universe and the Worlds, Fifth Dialogue (Singer transl.), p. 376; similarly, Nicholas of Cusa, Of Learned Ignorance, II, 13. 14 Good historical accounts will be found in McColley, op. cit.; A.

While Montaigne'8, Milton19, and Pope20 urged men to give more thought to mundane problems, others like Campanella21, Swift22, and Voltaire23 followed Lucian24 in using the imaginary inhabitants of other worlds as critics of or as models for condemning and attempting to rectify the follies of mankind. Throughout Europe astrobiology was an important part of the "evidences of Christianity"; only a few men, such as Thomas Paine25, thought that the plurality of worlds rendered Christianity "little and ridiculous, and scatters it in the mind like feathers in the air". But on one point all were agreed: the universe was full of life, man was not alone. The first detailed scientific criticism of the doctrine appeared in an anonymous work published in 1854 by William Whewell, The Plurality of Worlds. This book, by the eminent historian and philosopher of science well acquainted with the latest ad- vances in geology, biology, and astronomy, is a criticism of the classical English formulation of pluralism as an evidence of Christianity, the writings of Bishop Thomas Chalmers26. It is al- so a silent renunciation-perhaps this explains its anonymity- of conjectures about extraterrestrial life which he had permitted himself in his Bridgewater Treatise27 twenty years earlier. From his imposing astronomical and geological learning Whewell inferred that the universe has only a small number of planetary systems and that the earth is uniquely able to support life.28 He concluded: "The belief that other planets, as well as our own, are the seats of habita- tion of living beings has been entertained in general, not in consequence of physical reasons, but in spite of physical reasons; and because there were Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes (1686). 18 Essays, Book II, xii (London, 1891), p. 226. 9Paradise Lost VIII, lines 100-105. 20 An Essay on Man, Epistle I, lines 21-22 et passim. 21 Civitas soli (1623). 22 Gullivers Travels, Book III: "Voyage to Laputa". 23 Micromegas (1752). 24 See Lucian's Icaromennipus or the Sky-Man as well as his better known A True History. 25 The Age of Reason (Liberal Arts Press, 1948), p.44. 26 Discourses on the Christian Revelation Viewed in Connection with Modern As- tronomy (1818) in Works (New York, 1850), IV, pp. 362-414. 27 Cited in footnote 6, supra. 28 The Plurality of Worlds, pp. 161, 172, 186. 9</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION conceived to be other reasons, of another kind, theological and philosophi- cal, for such a belief."2 These "other reasons", however, no longer existed for Whewell -not because he doubted the validity of arguments from design but because he held that arguments from design pointed to the opposite conclusion. The world would be imperfectly designed if the incarnation of Christ were only terrestrial while there were unredeemable souls elsewhere in the universe.30 Whewell's book caused a great stir in Victorian theological and astronomical circles and was severely criticized.3' Hume's objection to the argument from design was not repeated by Whewell, but he was arguing as if he remembered Hume's words: "The religious hypothesis . . .must be considered only as a particular method for accounting for the visible phenomena of the universe; but no just reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single fact, or alter or add to the phenomena, any single particular."32 While one might argue from extraterrestrial life to the purposive design of parts of the universe indifferent to man, Hume would forbid us to argue from the assumption of pervasive design to the existence of unobserved life. But I do not think anyone re- membered Hume at this juncture; the argument from design was threatened much closer to home. It was considered more important to preserve the argument from design against Dar- win, Huxley, and Wallace33 to show that man is uniquely the purpose of terrestrial arrangements than it was to use the argu- ment to show that he is not unique in the cosmic order. There were soon two new scientific considerations which 29 Ibid., p. 234. 30 Ibid., pp. 282-287. The same problem led both Augustine (loc. cit.) and Melanch- thon (Initia doctrinae physicae, in Corpus Reformatorum XIII, columns 220-221) to deny the plurality of worlds. More imaginative solutions have appealed to some modern theologians; see the survey of (mostly German) literature in Wolfgang Muller, Man Among the Stars (New York, 1957), ch. 13. 31 For example, by Sir David Brewster, More Worlds than One (1854) and Richard Anthony Proctor, Other Worlds than Ours (1870) and Our Place Among the Infinites (1875). 32 Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, sect. 11. 33 Wallace's Man's Place in Nature (1893) is important not only for its conclusions against the doctrine of plurality, but because of its Lucretian rejection of teleological considerations which had been the principal bulwark of the theory before that time. It is the first treatment of the problem that reads like modern science. See J. M. Drachman, Studies in the Literature of Natural Science (New York, 1930), ch. 23. 10</page><page sequence="7">EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENT LIFE strengthened Whewell's case. The first was the refutation of the theory of spontaneous generation. Lucretius had believed that from the primal aggregations of matter life would spontaneously arise; now it seemed certain, on the best experimental evidence, that it would not. The second was the objections raised against the Kant-Laplace nebular hypothesis about the origin of the solar system. As long as this theory had been accepted, there had been ground for believing that all stars have planets. By the end of the century the evidence turned against it, and it was re- placed in astronomical orthodoxy by the explanation of solar systems as results of close approaches of stars to each other. Since such approaches can occur only seldom, planetary systems and hence life must be extremely rare. With the rejection of both the Plutarchean premise of design and the Lucretian premises of innumerable worlds and the natural generation of life, the ancient doctrine temporarily dis- appeared from both astronomy and theology; the "canals" of Mars had only a succes de scandale. Yet now once again we find the belief widespread, embraced by eminent astronomers and biologists and supported by taxpayers. Old ideas like this never die. When one argument fails, another will be found. Now it is an inference from non-anthropocentric naturalism. This Lucretian thought, filled out by the work of Copernicus, Dar- win, and Marx34, provides the philosophical basis for contempo- rary exobiology. But it is not the only one which motivates it, as we shall see. II The contemporary Lucretian argument stands on two legs, one astronomical and one biological. The astronomical is the hypothesis that the earth is not anomalous. Once again it seems that the occurrence of planetary systems can best be explained by a modification of the Kant-Laplace hypothesis, the implica- tion being that many suns support families of planets. While the problem of the infinity of the universe is not as clear to us as it appeared to Lucretius, it seems that the universe gets larger with every advance in astrophysics. There are 1021 stars in the observable universe, and this is quite enough for highly improb- able events to have occurred many times. Even if only one out of a million stars has at least one planet, there are 1015 planets in 34 See S. A. Kaplan, ed., Extraterrestrial Civilizations (Israel Program for Scientific Translations, Jerusalem, 1971), p. 257 n. (A very sophisticated book.) 11</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION the universe. Actually the probability derived from astronomical theory and a few delicate observations (e.g., of Barnard's Star) is much higher than one out of a million, so in all probability the number of planetary systems is much larger than 1015. The biological premise is likewise the rehabilitation of a theory rejected in the nineteenth century. Once again it is be- lieved that life arises spontaneously when conditions are" right". It was conjectured what the conditions were on the primitive earth, and then it was found in the laboratory that under these conditions organic molecules necessary for life are produced. One of the conditions we cannot replicate in the laboratory is their duration for billions of years, during which these com- pounds might polymerize and associate into simple living sys- tems from which the evolutionary process might begin. But ac- cording to strong scientific dogma this did occur on earth, and under like conditions elsewhere it is highly probable that the same process occurs there too. But how like do these conditions have to be? No one knows, for at most only one case is known, and there is no well-esta- blished theory of the transition of complex organic molecules to simple living systems from which the requisite degree of simi- larity and the probabilities might be deduced. If only one sun in a million has a planet, and only one planet in a million supports life, there are a thousand million abodes of life in the universe. This line of thought, however dear to popular science writers, implies nothing about the actual universe unless we know whether the second of these fractions-one out of a million- is of the right order of magnitude. It is, to be sure, a small frac- tion, but for all we know it may be much too large. The chem- istry underlying exobiology now provides only conjectures about what may perhaps be the necessary conditions of life; it says nothing about the sufficient conditions, or how probable is their occurrence. The connecting link between the new astronomical and new biochemical arguments lies in recent empirical discoveries. There are organic materials in meteorites and in interstellar space, and the gases occluded in moon-rocks suggest that the conditions necessary for the origin of life were not confined to the primitive earth. But absolutely nothing is known of what the sufficient conditions are, or how pervasive or local they may be. No one now expects to find advanced life elsewhere in the solar system. But in a few years we may know whether there is primitive life on Mars. A microorganism on Mars will convert 12</page><page sequence="9">EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENT LIFE "the miracle of life" on earth into a "mere statistic". It will con- tribute markedly to the argument that advanced life is present outside the solar system. III Space travel, or even the sending of instrumental probes, to other solar systems is so far beyond human reach that it is not worthwhile discussing at a sober philosophical cocktail party. Nor do I think it promising to hope or fear that we will get evi- dence of the existence of superior beings by their visiting us. The only even moderately realistic hope for evidence lies in re- ceiving and interpreting signals from extraterrestrial societies.35 The technology required presents no insurmountable obstacles; what stands in the way of using it is human unimaginativeness and impatience and the instability of human civilization. In the idea of interstellar communication, however, all the anthropomorphism so painfully eliminated with the Plutarchian argument insidiously reappears. To entertain hope of such con- verse requires that we believe that a pattern of evolution like ours, from simple organisms to advanced civilization, has been repeated within signalling distance and synchronously with our own development. It requires that the citizens of heavenly cities be sufficiently like us to reciprocate our curiosity and to take the same measures we would take to signal to them, and sufficiently unlike us to have managed a technological project which proba- bly exceeds our resources of curiosity, patience, and stability. All of these assumptions are highly speculative, but we must make them or else give up the game. If we are to suppose that those creatures are enough like us to make communication from them possible, we may have to sup- pose that their biochemical base is more like ours than we have 35 See A. G. W. Cameron, ed., Interstellar Communication (New York: Benjamin, 1963); I. S. Shklovskii and Carl Sagan, Intelligent Life in the Universe (New York: Del- ta, 1964), ch. 27-35; S. A. Kaplan, op. cit., pp. 1-212; Walter Sullivan, We Are Not Alone (New York: McGraw Hill, 1964), ch. 13-15. I cannot take seriously the possibility of es- tablishing the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations by the observation of artifacts other than signals (e.g., "Dyson spheres") because it seems to me we would be irresista- bly tempted by Occam's Razor to explain them as natural products. Only if we had "di- rect" evidence (through intelligible signals) of the existence of extraterrestrial civiliza- tions would an artificial origin of other artifacts appear to be a plausibly simple explana- tion. But I grant that the comparative simplicity of two hypotheses like these is an inex- act notion, and one of them may appear more plausible at one time and the other at an- other. The fate of the "canals" on Mars, however, does not inspire confidence in gross artifacts as evidence of intelligent design. 13</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION any conclusive reason to believe;36 but even assuming the same biochemistry we do not have any good reason to believe that the courses of the two evolutions would go in the same direction.37 We do not even know whether conscious intelligence, at least in its higher forms, is in the long run biologically advantageous or not even on earth, let alone elsewhere. Speaking against this op- timistic assumption is the fact that the only species on earth which prides itself on its intelligence is the only one with the in- telligence necessary, and possibly sufficient, to render itself ex- tinct tomorrow. We do not know whether the development of human-like species leads to species-suicide here or elsewhere; we do not know whether evolution elsewhere is likely to be pro- gressive in terrestrial terms or not. We cannot assume that our evolution is both typical and non-lethal for any other reason than that not to assume it puts a sudden end to our research. Even if we assume a common neurological base and evolu- tionary history, the cultural and technological aspects of human life are so loosely determined biologically that we must acknowl- edge the probability of widely divergent and perhaps unrecog- nizable manifestations of communal intelligence. We see this even on earth; why not expect it in the heavens? But everything that makes exotic extraterrestrial societies different from us re- duces the probability of their disclosure. The feasible methods of interstellar communication are filters which will keep out evidence of the existence of beings whose logic, grammar, and technology, if they have such, are radically different from our own. To hope for evidence of living beings with radically differ- ent technologies based upon exotic sciences and logics is in prin- ciple vain. To believe that there are societies elsewhere bent upon and capable of communicating with us is not only to be anthropomorphic; even worse, it is to believe that civilizations elsewhere are like one civilization that has existed on only a small portion of this earth for only a few hundred years. But for the sake of getting on with our work, let us grant that all these unlikely conditions may be fulfilled somewhere. But 36 On alternative biochemistries see V. A. Firsoff, Life Beyond the Earth (London: Hutchinson, 1963), pp. 106-146.

In order to com- municate with each other, two planetary populations have to be alike at the same time.38 One limiting factor is the density of civ- ilizations in space, but an equally severe constraint is their den- sity in time. The life-time of civilizations determines the proba- bility of their having overlapping durations. Given optimistic estimates of their absolute densities in space (say two within a hundred light years of each other), the average life-time if they are to have signal-competency at the same time must be of the order of 10 million years.39 In that length of time, biological change will predominate over cultural evolution. Suppose, how- ever, that species and civilizations can survive long enough to overlap to a significant degree. We, being a "young" technologi- cal civilization, must expect any other civilization with which we establish contact to be much older, technologically more ad- vanced, and socially more stable than we are. But then we run into another limiting factor. The longevity of a technology is much less than that of a civilization. Out of perhaps a half mil- lion years of human life, we have had a radiomagnetic compe- tency for 50 years, and fifty years from now it may be obsolete even if we still exist. Simultaneously existing civilizations are unlikely at any moment to possess compatible technologies of communication. Thus our conjectures concerning history, especially the future history, of mankind are important variables in estimating our chances of finding out if we are alone. One has to be exceedingly optimistic about the future of mankind to be even moderately confident of getting an answer to our old question. Personally I do not feel such optimism, but let me talk a bit as if I did. IV Let us suppose that radio astronomers aiming their dish at a nearby star pick up a modulated radio signal that seems to have come from a planet. What will we do? How will we read it? In the absence of collateral information, the necessary but not sufficient condition for knowing that something is a message is 3 "At the same time" is ambiguous. More precisely, the receiving civilization must at the time of reception be in the same technological stage as the sending civilization at the time of sending. Since stars are not all of the same age, the logic of the argument is not affected by the elapsed time of signal transport. 39 Compare the independent calculations of Shklovskii and Sagan (op. cit., pp. 413, 418, 450) with those of Sebastian von Hoerner in Cameron (op. cit., p. 275). 15</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION to know what it says.40 Since the necessary collateral information will be lacking, we must guess that it is a message, guess what it says, and then try to see if the signal can convey that message. Since we cannot know what encipherment has been used, we must make conjectures about that too on an anthropomorphic model. We must ask what message we would send and what en- cipherment we would use if we were they. Plausible candidates are: a binary encipherment of the series of prime numbers, the expansion of e, or simple arithmetic truths which will contextu- ally exhibit logical constants and operators.4 It should be possi- ble to match signals against such paradigms and look for a fit which would provide the necessary condition for deciding that a message had been received. But it would not be a sufficient condition, for the signal could have been produced by natural processes. To find out if it is an artifact of intelligence, we would follow Descartes' teaching that a machine can "speak" but can- not "discourse". We would try to answer the putative message by continuing it and waiting the appropriate number of years or decades or centuries to see if the series is correctly continued still further. If it is, we shall have as much proof as we can reasonably hope for. But there are an infinite number of rules by which a finite series of marks can be continued. Human imagination must limit the number of rules to be tried; and it is precisely the fact that this imagination is human which may be fatal to our hopes. If there is a sender, he may not recognize our return signal as an intelligent response, and we will have received a message with- out ever knowing it. Let us suppose, however, that we pass the first test and esta- blish the existence of an intelligent sender. That will be much, a very great deal, but not all we want. We want a vocabulary of denotative words. Professor Quine42 has made us familiar with a problem we meet here in extreme form. For us to know that a 40 This denies that "interstellar eavesdropping" (see J. A. Webb, in Cameron, op. cit., ch. 18) will give us the desired evidence. The detection of signals meant for domes- tic consumption on a heavenly body is more probable than the detection of unidirec- tional signals beamed to us; but since the former cannot, in all probability, be de- ciphered, the evidence that they are intelligently modulated will be unavailable. 41 Hans Freudenthal, Lincos, Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse (Amster- dam, 1960), vol.

But we do not know what facts extraterrestrial messages are to be about, since we do not know what kinds of things are up there to be talked about. We do not expect them to talk about rabbits as we do, but we don't even know whether "undetached parts of rab- bits""3 are there to be talked about in strange ways. Two means of providing the denotative components have been proposed. The messages might contain ostensive refer- ences to something we both can see, e.g., variations in the inten- sity of the sun.44 By scanning all likely fields of empirical infor- mation available to both of us we could try to match the puta- tively denotative content of the messages with them. Another means is superficially more promising: that they use television signals and supply us with a vocabulary.45 This is not technically impossible, provided we use the word "television" loosely. But there is an epistemological barrier which may be insurmountable. We do not know what things are up there and don't know how they will make themselves known to the sender. Therefore we have no way of knowing whether the pictorial ar- ray we achieve will correspond to any extraterrestrial fact. If their sensory channels are different from ours, as may well be the case, what is image for them will be snow for us. Only if the things they think worth talking about look to them in much the same way things we are interested in look to us can we correctly believe that we have received the picture they sent.46 V I have emphasized, but I do not believe I have exaggerated, 43Ibid., p. 52. 44 Suggested by Everett Hafner, "Techniques of Interstellar Communication," in Exobiology (Astronautical Society Publication no. 19 [1969]), pp. 37-68 at 60.

The idea was developed by Fred Hoyle in his novel, The Black Cloud. 46 Underlying the applicability of television is an anthropomorphic assumption that the information input of the sender of the message is like that of us human receivers, and there is not the slightest reason for believing this to be the case. Suppose, on the con- trary, that his principal information channel is a sense organ unknown to us; or, for pur- pose of simplication, suppose it to be olfactory. In the latter case he identifies an apple by the distribution, spatial or temporal, of smells. He will then send a tele-olfaction image which we will interpret as a television image. But since the olfactory image he has is different from the optical image we receive, we will not recognize the latter as the image of an apple. (This assumes, furthermore, that there are things like apples up there.) 17</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION some difficulties in establishing the existence of intelligent extra- terrestrial life. I have emphasized them because most of those now writing on the problem seem to me to minimize them. They have invariably assigned favorable probabilities to un- known but limiting conditions. Though they have insistently warned against the dangers of anthropomorphism, their models have been inescapably anthropomorphic. Their assumptions have not been made irresponsibly; they have been made as the minimum price for responsible speculation. But I want to ask in conclusion, why do almost all their speculations now point in the same direction? I have two answers, one cynical and one senti- mental. The cynic will say it is not accidental that the belief is held most strongly at a time when it is at last within the range of technology to discover if it is true. One of the reasons for our space program is to find out if there is extraterrestrial life; but unless the estimated probabilities of success are high, they can- not be used in justifying the enormous costs involved. What more natural, then, that those who have to justify the costs or go out of the business of exobiology should strongly believe in the possibility, nay the probability, of success? I am not accusing anyone of dishonesty or even of disingenuousness; I am merely reminding you that nothing succeeds without hope of success, and that in general the antecedent credulity with which an in- teresting hypothesis is held varies directly with the costs in- curred in establishing it. The other answer is more speculative. While the old argu- ment from design is heard no more, I suspect that deep-seated philosophical, religious, and existential commitments which once availed themselves of the argument from design are still silently effective in guiding the Lucretian argument and keep- ing alive the archetypal idea that man is not alone.4 Myth, religion, and now science-fiction with their tales of benevolent and malevolent extraterrestrial beings are commen- tar'ies on the human condition. I believe even responsible sci- entific speculation and expensive technology of space explora- tion in search for other life are the peculiarly modern equivalent of angelology and Utopia or of demonology and apocalypse. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there was a deep 47 For somewhat similar ideas see Carl G. Jung, Flying Saucers (New York, 1969) and Robert Plank, The Emotional Significance of Imaginary Beings (Charles C. Thomas Co., 1968), esp. pp. 149-150. 18</page><page sequence="15">EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENT LIFE pessimism about the decline of nature, polluted by the sins of man.48 Nature was redeemed if there were higher beings in the universe, so all was not lost even though man and earth were corrupt. There was the silence of infinite space which frightened Pascal; he suffered a "Brunonian shock"'9 upon moving out of a friendly sphere into a lifeless infinite mechanism. This shock could be ameliorated by seeing the stars as other homes, and the universe as friendly to life after all. We are now suffering from technological shock, destroying by radiological and chemical, if not moral, pollution the only abode of life we know. Are we not enough like our ancestors to respond with the same desperate hope they did? Exobioloby recapitu- lates eschatology. The eschatological hope of help from heaven revives when the heavens of modern astronomy replace the Heaven of religion. That we can learn from more advanced so- cieties in the skies the secret of survival is the eschatological hope which motivates, or at least is used to justify, the work of exobiologists.50 But somewhat like people who object to spend- ing money needed in the ghettoes on exploring the moon, I think the best hope for our survival is to be based on under- standing human predicaments here on earth, not on expecting a saving message from super-human beings in the skies. Thinking about and even hoping to find extraterrestrial civi- lizations, however, sharpen our search for and appreciation of the peculiar virtues and vices of the only form of life we know. Exobiology and other exo-sciences cannot proceed merely by generalization from terrestrial experience; they must construct models of a more abstract nature of which terrestrial life and so- ciety are specifications. In that way hypotheses about extrater- restrial situations may throw light on the terrestrial, while the illumination of the extraterrestrial by hard facts about life on earth is at best dim and wavering. What Peter Winch has said about anthropology, we may say about exo-sociology: "Seriously to study another way of life is necessarily to seek to extend our own-not simply to bring the other way within the already ex- isting boundaries of our own. . .".'1 Even if the exo-sciences fail 48 See Victor Harris, All Coherence Gone (Chicago, 1949), esp. pp. 95, 104; Marjorie Hope Nicolson, The Breaking of the Circle (Evanston, 1950), ch. 3 and 4. 49 Wolfgang Philip, Das Zeitalter der Aufklirung (Bremen, 1963), p. xxvii. 50 For example, Gosta Ehrensvaard, Man on Another World (University of Chicago Press, 1965), pp. 7-9, 168 et passim; Puccetti, op. cit., pp. 113ff. 51 "Understanding a Primitive Society," American Philosophical Quarterly I (1964), 307-324 at 317-18. 19</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION to attain their prime goal, here is a valuable by-product. The quest for other, and better, forms of life, society, technology, ethics, and law may not reveal that they are actual elsewhere; but it may in the long run help us make some of them actual on earth. Yet after all there is some glimmer of hope for an answer. As long as it exists-and I think it will exist as long as we do-it would be a mistake to let niggardliness, skepticism, and despair inhibit the search. Many more harmful things can be done with our technology than listening for another civilization. If it should be successful, probably nothing is more worth using it for. So we have to ask, how should we proceed, and what shall we do if we succeed? To the first, there are two simple and prudent answers. Let us give more thought to possible worlds so as to prepare ourselves to interpret any evidence we get that they are actual. Here is work for disciplined science-fiction writers, astronomers, biolo- gists, psychologists, sociologists, and linguisticians. I venture to believe that even philosophers might be of some help. Second, let there be world-wide sharing of resources of radio observatories. If all appropriate observatories devote some time to a systematic project of this kind, the costs in other more ef- ficient research can be equitably spread.52 But it must be re- membered that the search is not worth undertaking unless it is planned to last decades, centuries, or even forever. Such cooper- ation would be a small step in bringing about the discovery of how much enlightened intelligence there is on one planet at least, our own. And what if we succeed? I have two conjectures. First, after a few weeks it will be forgotten, just as the details of the first moon landing have already been forgotten by most people. We are so well prepared by popular science and science-fiction for signals from outer space53 that success will be just another nine- day's wonder like Orson Wells' "Invasion from Mars" or the "Great Moon Hoax" which shocked New York City in 1837.54 52 Progress was made in this direction at the Byurakan Soviet-American Conference on Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence; see News Report (National Acad- emy of Sciences) October, 1971, pp. 1, 4-5. 53 According to the Gallup Poll, 53% of the people listed in International Who's Who believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life. New York Times, June 13, 1971. 54 Richard Adams Locke, The Great Moon Hoax, or a Discovery that the Moon has a Vast Population of Human Beings (New York, 1859). 20</page><page sequence="17">EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENT LIFE My second conjecture is: it will never be forgotten. For what is important is not a single discovery, but the beginning of an endless series of discoveries which will change everything in un- foreseeable ways. We will be well prepared for the initial dis- covery, since we have to know what it will be to know when it has occurred. We are not prepared for the next discovery and the discovery after that; we have no idea what they will be. But if they are made, there is no limit to what in coming centuries we might learn about other creatures and, more portentously, about ourselves. Compared to such advances in knowledge, the Copernican and Darwinian Revolutions and the discovery of the New World55 would have been but minor preludes. 55 Responses to the discovery of America, which was unanticipated, give, in spite of this difference, some clues to what may be reactions to the discovery of other worlds. For example, the question as to whether the American aborigines had souls and whether they were under natural law was discussed in terms not wholly unlike those in which our ethical and political relations with extraterrestrial beings are now discussed.
