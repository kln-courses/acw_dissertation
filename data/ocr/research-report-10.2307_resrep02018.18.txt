Archaeological survey and research in four subdistricts of interior East Kalimantan (Pujungan, Kerayan, Malinau and Kayan Hulu) Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato1 with reports by Aryandini Novita, Krisprihartini S., Dody Johanjaya, Anggara Yonathan and Yoga Prima Subandono INTRODUCTION A number of megalithic structures are found on the upper reaches of the Bahau River and along its tributaries, in Pujungan Subdistrict. They consist primarily of urn-dolmen burial monuments. According to the Kenyah who now inhabit this area, these megalithic structures were erected by the Ngorek (see Sellato 1992b, 1995c). From historical reconstructions by Sellato, it is surmised that the Ngorek originally came from the upper Baram River in Sarawak. War with the Kelabit peoples finally forced some of the Ngorek to move to East Kalimantan in approximately 1700 AD. By about 1750, the Ngorek are believed to have occupied the area of the upper Lurah and upper Bahau rivers. By the middle of the 18th century, a coalition of Modang, Kayan, and Kenyah groups attacked the Ngorek. Some of the Ngorek were defeated and taken away by their conquerors far from their area of origin, and the rest fled and scattered. Today 1 Karina Arifin compiled the sections titled ‘Survey of Megalithic Sites in Four Districts’ and ‘Test Pits in Long Pujungan Subdistrict’ (on the basis of her own research), and ‘Megalithic Graves: A Summary’; while Bernard Sellato contributed data from his survey in Kayan Hulu Subdistrict and rewrote the sections titled ‘Inventory of Stone Grave Sites on the Upper Bahau’ (based on a report by Dody Johanjaya, Anggara Yonathan, and Yoga Prima Subandono) and ‘Analysis of Artefacts Found in Apau Ping’ (based on a report by Aryandini Novita and Krisprihartini). For more comprehensive data, see Karina Arifin 1995, Dody Johanjaya et al. 1995, Aryandini Novita and Krisprihartini 1995. </page> <page sequence="2"> 200 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH the entire area is occupied by various Kenyah groups. On the basis of this reconstruc- tion, the history of these megalithic remains is believed to be traceable to the 17th century. The most recent structures, however, may date back to the beginning of the 19th century, and the current local inhabitants state that the carved urn-dolmen burial site at Long Pulung contains the bones of one Paran La’ing, a king of the Ngorek (Sellato 1995c). The megalithic remains in the Long Pujungan area were reported by Schneeberger, who visited Long Pulung and Long Berini in the course of a geological survey in the 1930s (Schneeberger 1979: 67–68). He referred to them as urn-dolmens, on the basis of the standard in their construction, i.e., a large stone urn placed on top of four river stones or two stone slabs, and protected by a large stone slab supported by two other stone slabs. Sometimes, this large stone slab is placed directly on top of the stone urn as a cover, without supporting slabs. Schneeberger also visited a number of megalithic sites in the Kerayan area and one site on the upper Malinau River. Explanations for these megalithic remains have also been offered by Martin Baier, in his discussion of various stone burial structures in the Long Pujungan area (Baier 1987, 1992). He also described a number of sarcophagi in the Apo Kayan area (Baier 1992), which had been mentioned earlier by Sierevelt (1929). These monuments have been grouped into two types, the urn-dolmen and the sarcophagus. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES Research into the history of the Ngorek and their connection with the megalithic struc- tures was started by Sellato in his first short survey in Pujungan Subdistrict in 1990. Previous Surveys and Research In 1991, Sellato carried out a more systematic survey in order to obtain some basic information. From ethnohistorical studies, in particular, it was possible to learn a little about the Ngorek who built the megalithic structures in the Long Pujungan area. In February and March of the following year (1992), a very short archaeological survey was undertaken in Apau Ping. Several sites were visited, among them a site thought to be a former settlement, as well as seven burial sites (Manguin 1995). It was also possible to record approximately 70 urn-dolmen burial sites and 15 settlement sites. In addition, more than 100 stone tools were collected from local inhabitants. Of these, 90% originated in Apau Ping, while the remainder came from the surrounding area and from neighbouring villages. A test pit measuring 2 x 1 m was opened and two scrapings were also dug in Apau Ping by Drs. Kiwok Rampai from the Regional Office of the Department of Education and Culture in Central Kalimantan. Their locations were chosen on the basis of the density of surface finds of stone tools and of the situation of the site’s surface, slightly elevated above the surrounding area. Earthenware shards were found in abundance at every level and some of them shared similarities with the earthenware made in Apau Ping today. In 1992, all available information was combined in a report on the Ngorek (Sellato 1995c). By early 1993, more than 100 Ngorek sites had been recorded in Pujungan Subdistrict, and about 250 stone implements had been collected from the people in Apau Ping. On the basis of this survey, further research was considered necessary in order to obtain more detailed information about the Ngorek groups. </page> <page sequence="3"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 201 Archaeological Research in 1993 The archaeological research in 1993 consisted of several activities. The activities carried out in Jakarta concerned the analysis of a number of stone tools and earthenware shards from the Apau Ping location (Aryandini Novita and Krisprihartini). In the field, the activities included a survey of several urn-dolmen burial sites that could not be visited in the earlier surveys in Pujungan Subdistrict (by Karina Arifin), as well as a first survey of sites in Kerayan Subdistrict and Malinau District (by Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato) and Kayan Hulu Subdistrict (by Sellato); inventory and mapping of several sites already visited in the Apau Ping and Long Berini areas (by Dody Johanjaya, Anggara Yonathan, and Yoga Prima Subandono); and the opening of test pits in several former settlement sites (by Karina Arifin). The survey of archaeological sites in Pujungan Subdistrict aimed at obtaining a clearer picture of the range of variation of burial structures and their distribution, visiting Ngorek settlement sites, and searching for a stone extraction site or a stone tool workshop site. The districts of Kerayan and Malinau also were chosen for surveying because of the recorded existence of megalithic structures possibly related to the megalithic structures of Long Pujungan and for comparative purposes. It was thus hoped that this would produce additional information to assist the interpretation of the megalithic structures in the Long Pujungan area. The digging of several test pits in two former settlement sites in Apau Ping and Long Beraa was especially intended to clarify the existence of cultural strata which distinguished the remains of the Ngorek people from those of groups which occupied the same sites in later times, that is, the Kenyah Leppo’ Ma’ut and the Leppo’ Ké, and to improve understanding of the features of the life of the Ngorek people. In addition, an ethnographic survey was carried out and data was collected on the burial customs of several ethnic groups now living in the three districts of Pujungan, Kerayan, and Malinau (see Karina Arifin, in Eghenter and Sellato 1999). Surface surveys were undertaken in Apau Ping, Long Beraa, and Long Berini (Pujungan Subdistrict), mainly, the collection of earthenware shards, for comparison with the finds in the test pits and with modern earthenware; and ethnographic information was collected on the manufacture of traditional earthenware (see Karina Arifin 1995; Karina and Sellato, in Eghenter and Sellato 1999). SURVEY OF MEGALITHIC SITES IN FOUR SUBDISTRICTS This survey was carried out in the subdistricts of Pujungan, Kerayan, Malinau, and Kayan Hulu. The age of the megalithic sites in Pujungan Subdistrict has been determined approximately on the basis of ethnohistorical research and it is thought that none postdate the early 19th century. Similarly, the remains found in Kayan Hulu Subdistrict are thought to date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. The age of the known sites in Kerayan Subdistrict is not yet known, and, in fact, for a large number of them, it is not yet clear which ethnic group established them. Schneeberger (1979: Map III) reported on an urn-dolmen burial site on the upper Malinau River which resembles those on the upper Bahau River, leading to the expectation that similar structures would be found further downriver on the Malinau. So far, in the areas visited, no remains of stone structures have been found, and thus Malinau District will not be further mentioned in this part. A number of wooden burial structures have been discovered, which has been discussed by Karina Arifin (in Eghenter and Sellato 1999). </page> <page sequence="4"> 202 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH Pujungan Subdistrict Archaeological surveys were carried out in two areas (see Figure 11.1): on the upper Bahau River, including the vicinity of Apau Ping, where work was conducted by Karina Arifin and three young archaeologists (Dody Johanjaya et al. 1995); and on the Lurah River, where Karina Arifin carried out work with the assistance of four local staff. A number of the upper Bahau sites reviewed in earlier surveys were visited again in order to obtain a clearer picture of the problem. Five of them were later mapped and documented in detail (Dody Johanjaya et al. 1995; see below). Other sites that were Figure 11.1  Archaeological sites in Pujungan Subdistrict 0 10 20 km KERAYAN N village MALINAU visited sites recorded sites APAU PING  SARAWAK ni Beri KAYAN HULU LONG  ALANGO Lurah LONG  PUJUNGAN Pu B ahau jungan Iwan Beraa Berau Ngiam u Bah a </page> <page sequence="5"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 203 visited are described briefly here (for terminology relating to the parts of the burial structure, see Figure 11.2). The survey in the Lurah River area was intended to locate sites showing outcropping basalt, the material from which the stone implements found on the upper Bahau River were manufactured. In addition, other, new archaeological sites were visited. In a previous survey, Sellato had obtained information that at a place called Leppo’ Teranan, on the watershed between the Lurah and Iwan river basins, piles of worked stones could be found. This raised the possibility that the site may have been a workshop for the manufacture of stone implements. Leppo’ Teranan was not visited, however, because the information was somewhat unclear, especially with regard to the time required in order to reach the site. Figure 11.2  Terminology of the stone urn-dolmen 1  cap 2  lid 3 urn 4 posts 5 stands The Apau Ping Area Seven sites were surveyed in this area. Some had been surveyed earlier, others were new sites, surveyed for the first time.   Kiam Bio’: 18 urn-dolmens, most of which have already collapsed, with their stone urns already opened. Urns are 60–70 cm high, round (diameter of the hole 45 cm) or oval (50 x 30 cm; depth of the hole 30 cm). The pillars of the dolmen are oval river stones, or stone pieces resembling a curved board (‘onion skin’).   Tanjung Ikeng: a large, intact stone urn-dolmen, partially covered with soil. The table (or roof) of the dolmen measures 225 x 150 cm, and the urn 95 x 70 cm. Its height is not clear. Its five pillars are ‘onion skin’ stone pieces.   Long Ngiam: a line of 13 stone urn-dolmens, oriented north-south, all of them already toppled over. There likely are others, covered by brush. The urns are either round or ovoid; one of them is very round (hole diameter 48 cm, and 52 cm deep). The pillars are ‘onion skin’ stone pieces; the table’s shape varies with the shape of the stone used. </page> <page sequence="6"> 204 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH   Lubang Buka’: a line of five or more urn-dolmens with a NW-SE orientation. All of them have toppled over and are scattered about. One is located on a steep cliff, its urn broken, and some of its pillars have tumbled to the foot of the cliff.   Long Beraa: see the site description below. Surface finds of earthenware shards show similarities with finds in the test pit on this site. The shards are parts of a pot’s body, except for one neck part. The temper is sand and crushed earthenware. On the basis of colour, this earthenware consists of at least three types.   Long Berini: see the site description below. Surface finds of earthenware shards include 13 pieces (including two rims, and one neck), of a grey colour with a temper of crushed earthenware. Some show a residual layer of resin. Two shards show string decoration or incised decoration (Figure 11.3). Two tools for beating tree bark (to make clothing), made of sandstone, show a flat bottom part incised with cross lines (Figure 11.4).   Apau Ping: Apau Ping was successively inhabited by the Ngorek, the Leppo’ Ma’ut, and today the Leppo’ Ké. Surface finds (see Figure 11.5) include an ovoid pounder with a flat base forming a 1.5 cm wide ring (see Sellato 1996); a sharpening tool made of sandstone of the same shape as that described below; and earthenware shards of several colours, generally of the same type as those found in the test pit, including shards of a round cooking pot and of a container thought to have been a plate (Figure 11.6). The earthenware shows string decoration and chequered decorations produced by a paddle carved with cross lines. The temper is sand and crushed earthenware. Shards of foreign stoneware with a grey paste and a brownish black glaze were also found.

Long Lenjau Ca: two stone graves. One is rectangular (159 x 88 cm; with 11 cm thick walls), with a narrower base. Its lid (140 cm long) was found nearby, along with a beam-shaped menhir (80 x 32 x 20 cm). The second grave is ovoid (49 x 33 cm, wall thickness 6 cm). Its lid (105 x 102 cm) is lying nearby.   Long Ping: a dolmen with a table (165 x 130 cm) resting on stone pillars 50 cm high. The stone urn is not visible. Nearby are four rectangular columns or slabs measuring 105 x 47 x 10 cm and 75 x 23 x 20 cm, and three standing menhirs, two of which resemble beams measuring 90 x 34 x 26 cm and 70 x 34 x 27 cm.   Long Tela’u: two nearby sites. At one site are a dolmen with a table measuring 164 x 164 cm and several menhirs, one of which resembles a long beam. In the second site, several menhirs are found standing around a pile of river stones.   Lepu’un Nyibun: the site is located on a flat hilltop, where a line of Ficus trees stand. Four cylindrical stone urns range between 52 and 165 cm in height. One is ovoid (104 x 55 cm) and rather squat, with urn walls 15–20 cm thick; the urn cover is lying nearby. Nearby, too, lies a takung or swampy pond.   Lubang Lenjau: the site is on a flat hilltop. An artificial ditch 4 m wide is visible (formerly sharpened bamboos were stuck into the ground as a defence). One of several small clefts in the hill side, which can be entered for about 2 m, contained four human skulls and various bones (limbs), already cemented into the cave sediments, as well as an old baby carrier, the remains of a wooden shield, and the sheath of a machete. Kerayan Subdistrict This survey was carried out to obtain some preliminary information on the district’s inhabitants, their traditional burial practices, and related archaeological remains (Karina Arifin), and their languages, history, economy, and customs (Sellato). Archaeological information had been available only from written sources (Schneeberger 1979), which mention ten sites of menhirs and carved human figures. Only a few of these sites could be visited, but thanks to information obtained from the local people a large number of new sites was recorded (Figure 11.7) and some of these could be visited:   Long Api, Kerayan Darat: Here is found a batu (battuh) terupun (‘stone heap’), consisting of an accumulation of river stones on which a large dolmen of board-shaped pillars and table stand. At present, only two of these stone slab pillars (220 cm high) and the collapsed table slab (290 x 195 cm) remain. These stones are linked to the popular mythical figure of Yupai Semaring. A stone mortar, with a single deep cavity like a stone urn, is found in front of the elementary school. Only part of its square base remains, showing incisions around it and indentations scratched in. This stone is beaten during the dry season to bring on the rains.   Bang Iluk, Long Bawan: One of a number of caves in the hills around Long Bawan, believed to contain archaeological remains. The cave walls are of coarse yellow sandstone permeated with water.

This place is often visited by people on outings. Yet, except for Coca Cola cans, there are no signs of use or habitation.   Kuala Belawit, Kerayan Hilir: A stone slab, noted by Schneeberger (1979), is now erected near the church.   Terang Baru, Kerayan Hilir: Three batu terupun are found in the grass fields, all already dismantled. Two were visited. The first is a heap of stones, on top of which stone slabs are still visible, some already broken. The other is a stone heap with a collapsed stone slab. In the village, several stone slabs, apparently transported from the batu terupun, have been erected to mark particular spots and the church.   Sungai Bulu, Kerayan Hulu: Six rectangular stone graves are found, consisting of stone slabs forming a wall (the highest 115 cm; and 80–120 cm wide). This burial complex has been dismantled, part has collapsed, the stone slab covers are broken, and skulls and bones are scattered around. Among the many ceramic shards found: pieces of brown stoneware jars, high-temperature porcelain jars, bowls, and plates. Also, the base of a stone urn and pieces of its walls. On the wall of one of the graves a carved human figure is visible.   Sungai Kuyur, Kerayan Hulu: 12 or more stone graves, all dismantled, with their stone walls removed, broken up, and scattered, and the ceramic jars lost. One stone urn (90 cm high; outer diameter of the mouth 31 cm) shaped like a ceramic jar, complete with ears, is found below the grave, the walls of which are still standing. At Pa’ Sing, this type of grave is called bupun.   Upstream from Tang La’an, Kerayan Hulu: A batu (battuh) narit (‘carved stone’) was carved in low relief in the flat stones of the river bank, showing two human figures, one of them holding something (a shield?) in its right hand and standing on the other figure (Figure 11.8; see also Figure 11.9). Both are represented with their hands raised up, their legs open, with the heels of the feet protruding and forming a spiral. Their wide rectangular ears display some sort of ornament.   Tang La’an, Kerayan Hulu: Several rectangular menhirs of hard sandstone are found in the village. Two of them were moved from the village of Pa’ Upan. One is known as Battuh Sangui (Dragon Stone), the other has been set up in front of the elementary school (Figure 11.10). Another menhir has been transported from the village of Pa’ Ibang. Schneeberger (1979) saw these menhirs in their villages of origin. A pair of natural stones, also moved from Pa’ Upan when the villagers settled in Tang La’an, are known as Battuh Berek (Pig Stone) and Battuh La’al (Chicken Stone). Kayan Hulu Subdistrict The current Kenyah population of Apo Kayan do not know the name Ngorek, but refer to all pre-Kenyah sites of former settlers in the area as ‘Kayan’. In a very quick survey (six days) in Kayan Hulu Subdistrict, 45 such ‘Kayan’ sites were recorded from the local oral tradition (see Figure 11.11). Some of these can clearly be attributed to the Modang and not the Kayan. Of these 45 sites, 27 are located in Kayan Hulu Subdistrict and the remainder in Kayan Hilir Subdistrict. In at least 30 of the 45 sites, traces of a pre-Kenyah settlement are visible, 12 sites contain stone graves, and five show carved stones (some of these belonging to stone graves). A small number of the sites were visited by Sierevelt (1929), Tillema (1938), Harrisson (1959b), Whittier (1974), or </page> <page sequence="11"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 209 Figure 11.8 Two anthropomorphic figures at Paru’ Ating, Kerayan Hulu area of Kerayan Subdistrict Figure 11.9 Anthropomorphic figure carved on a rock face by the river near Pa’ Upan, Kerayan Subdistrict </page> <page sequence="12"> 210 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH Figure 11.10 Two menhirs standing in front of the village school, Tang La’an, Kerayan Subdistrict Figure 11.11 Archaeological sites in Kayan Hulu and Kayan Hilir Subdistricts, Apo Kayan SARAWAK 3128 29 30 DATA DIAN N LONG  NAWANG 16 20 0 5 10 15 20 km 18 1 8 17 19 4 2 3 visited or documented recorded 5 village Baier (1992).

Information was also obtained on sites with carved stones, such as Long Sungan, Sawa’ Angen, and Batu Kalung, in the vicinity of the village of Lidung Payau (J. Halapiry, pers. com.). The carved stones at the first two sites clearly were pillars for a stone vat.

This decision was based on several criteria, including the location and size of the site and the number and variety of its stone structures, as well as their condition. Description of Findings A total of five sites were mapped (Figure 11.25). Urn-dolmen burial structures were drawn and photographed one by one, especially those still in good condition and representative of particular types (for types of urn-dolmen burials, see Figure 11.26). Long Berini The site looks clean of undergrowth and a number of urn-dolmen burials are still visible (see Figures 11.27 to 11.30). This site was once honoured with a visit from officials of the Regional Development Planning Office (Bappeda) of Bulungan District, who were kind enough to leave a souvenir in the form of writing in large letters ‘BAPPEDA’ with yellow paint on the burial structures. Of about 40 urn-dolmen structu- res, only eight are still intact and standing, complete with pillars, table, and stone urn, six have collapsed, and the remainder are heavily damaged. Many of the tables and pillars are of sandstone that tends to weather into ‘onion skin’ layers. A small number of pillars are rectangular slabs. The burial container is an urn dug of soft sandstone, or a ceramic jar (broken). The stone urns are bowl-shaped or rectangular, or ovoid with either a round or rectangular opening. They are from 40 to 100 cm in height and their walls are 5–16 cm thick. Three graves of different sizes are found clustered, forming a complex grave. The largest contains a bowl-shaped stone urn that is still intact; the same was true of the next one; the third urn, however, is rectangular. Some graves have two containers under one roof, the main one a large stone urn, and the other a ceramic jar, inserted between a pillar of the dolmen and one of the stones supporting the urn. The only ceramic jar that was almost intact is decorated with protruding spirals, meanders, and pillars, and covered with a dark brown glaze. A cup of local earthenware (8 cm high) was also found buried between the pillars of the dolmen, as were shards of earthenware pots (12 cm high). Several urns without lids were found full of dirt, </page> <page sequence="20"> 218 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH Figure 11.25 Graveyard sites inventoried and test pits in Pujungan Subdistrict BAHAU 2 APAU  PING 3 5 LONG BERINI 1 AAR BE 4 LONG ALANGO LONG BENA LEPU' UN JALUNG APAU ANGAN RA H LU N LONG GAN PUJUNGAN UJU N 0 5 10km P 1.

It was not possible to determine whether the few intact urns contained bones, because the space between the mouth of the urn and the roof of the dolmen was too small. Ka Tempu The site is covered with brush and trees and after it was cleared it became clear that trees and roots have already done considerable damage to the structures (see Figures 11.31 and 11.32). The graves are concentrated in the southeastern part of the site; in the northwest they are much fewer; and in between is an empty area. Several graves are also located on a steep slope, where some of the soil has already slid down. There is a total of about 80 graves of various sizes, types, and conditions, of which 6 are intact, 12 have collapsed, and the rest are heavily damaged. In several graves, a ceramic jar is found in place of the stone urn under the roof of the dolmen. One stone container is cylindrical and has toppled. One stone urn lid is carved in relief with a creature (a frog?) with hands and feet with five fingers/toes. As at Long Berini, the burial containers are of soft sandstone, while the roof and pillars are of ‘onion skin’ stone, except for a few that have slab pillars. The urns are variously shaped: cylindrical, bowl-shaped, rectangular, or ovoid with either a round or rectangular opening. They range in height from 33.5 cm to 117 cm, with walls 10– 12 cm thick. Two ceramic jars are of the same type as those found in Long Berini, broad and short and with a dark brown glaze. Figure 11.31  Cylindrical stone container in Ka’ Tempu (No. 17) </page> <page sequence="25"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 223 Figure 11.32  Ovoid stone container in Ka’ Tempu (No. 50) Long Kale’ This rather narrow site with an uneven ground surface was covered with brush and trees and needed clearing. None of the 18 graves stands intact, and only three are in fairly good condition, even though some parts have collapsed or disappeared. The other graves are broken, although in several of them the form of the urn is still recognisable. The pillars and roof of the dolmen are of ‘onion skin’ slabs of hard stone, while the containers are of soft stone. There is not much variation in urn shapes: cylindrical, bowl-shaped, and ovoid with rectangular opening. Not a single ceramic jar was found. Long Pulung The site is located on a gently sloping plain, in an old orchard, and looks clean and well maintained. This site, too, has been visited by staff from the Development Planning Office of Bulungan District, as indicated by the word ‘BAPPEDA’ in yellow paint on one of the monuments. It is enclosed by a 2 m high fence, already damaged, and by a lock on the gate. Of the dozen graves visible, only two remain intact, one still stands but has lost its urn, four have collapsed, and the remainder are nothing but broken pieces. The dolmens have ‘onion skin’ pillars and roofs. Several of those stones look as if they have been worked to smoothen out both surfaces, and one has been processed </page> <page sequence="26"> 224 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH into a slab. One rectangular stone container with a narrower base (palung or trough) has a dent cut at the mouth and a hole in the side. Another, partly broken, is cylindrical, with geometric decorations carved all over its surface (see Figure 11.33). Altogether, there are four urn shapes: cylindrical, rectangular with a narrower base, bowl-shaped, and ovoid with a round opening. Figure 11.33  Carved stone urn in Long Pulung, upper Bahau Long Beraa This site is covered with dense brush and trees. Nyibun burial structures are located slightly below the megalithic graveyard. One big, Y-shaped wooden post still stands firmly and the ceramic jar at its top is intact. Another Nyibun post has rotted and collapsed, and scattered around and half buried are pieces of the ceramic jar with dragon motifs in relief, two gongs of different sizes, and a bent machete blade. The stone grave complex is located on level land that was once cleared, and consists of five structures. Two intact monuments display stone containers with a rectangular opening and a rounded and narrower base. The pillars and roof are stone blocks, or slabs combined with coarse blocks. The containers are of softer stone. One container has a domed lid of ‘onion skin’ stone, underneath the dolmen roof. In one container (Figures 11.34 and 11.35), 12 human skulls and other bones (limbs and ribs) and a small rusty gong are found. Another grave contains a ceramic jar already broken. The remaining graves are heavily damaged. </page> <page sequence="27"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 225 Figure 11.34 Stone monuments in Long Beraa (No.3) Figure 11.35  Skulls and bones from grave No. 3 in Long Beraa </page> <page sequence="28"> 226 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH Discussion The sites mapped cover an area ranging from 30 to 6000 m2 and are located from 5 to 20 m from the river. Generally, they extend parallel to the river (except at Long Beraa). At the five sites, a total of 155 graves were found, more than 50% of which are at Ka Tempu. On average, only 11.6% of the total number of graves are still intact. This fact is a matter for considerable concern, and even the sites in isolated areas have not escaped destruction. According to the local people, several sites have in fact been used for farming, one of the major causes of destruction, because the future field is burned. Destruction, however, can also be caused by the river (erosion of the banks), the growth of roots and trees, and the activities of animals, such as pigs, which like to root around in the ground. Of the five sites, only one (Long Pulung) shows any indication of an effort at preservation (fencing the site), since this location is very easy to visit. For 80 graves (51.6%), it was still possible to determine the original type and shape of the burial container (see Table 11.1). For example, at Long Berini (22 containers): 10 urns are ovoid with a round opening, 4 are bowl-shaped, 3 are rectangular, 2 are ovoid with a rectangular opening, and 3 more are ceramic jars. The overall most common container shape is the ovoid urn with a round opening (36 examples). One monument at Long Berini should be noted, because not only is it the highest monument recorded, but its stone urn is also the largest, with a diameter of 120 cm, a height of 80 cm, and 10 cm thick walls.

At Long Beraa, for example, dolmen pillars are found only on the two sides of the grave, a consequence of the use of a rectangular container (sarcophagus). Likewise, supporting stones are used for the bowl- Cylinder Rectangular with Narrower Base Rectangular with Rounded Base Bowl Shaped Rectangular ’bowl’ Ovoid with Round Opening Ovoid with Rectangular Opening Ceramic Jar Total </page> <page sequence="29"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 227 shaped stone urn, whereas cylindrical stone containers and ceramic jars are partly buried in the ground. The roof and pillars of the dolmen and the supporting stones of the container generally are not finely worked and of whatever form, and simply adjusted to the size of the container. Furthermore, it is difficult to discover the relationship between sites, because there are many differences. From the similarities in the general shape of the monuments, however, it can be established that the people who built them had the same capabilities and technology, although with a different creativity. The burial containers may be filled with the bones of more than one individual, as at Long Beraa, making the container a collective grave. Small gongs or earthenware pots and cups, found in several graves, are believed to be grave goods. The layout of the sites differs from one site to the next, except for the lining-up of the graves parallel to the river bank. At Ka Tempu, there are two separate concentrations of graves, believed to point to the existence of two distinct groups. According to the local inhabitants, the graves can be differentiated into those with carved containers (Ka Tempu and Long Pulung)—the graves of paren bio’ (chiefs of ethnic group)—and those with plain containers. At Long Berini, the large monuments tend to be surrounded by smaller graves that seem to cling to them. The larger graves are believed to indicate a higher social position of the occupant. The differences in the features of a grave—shape, material of the container, size, presence of stone supports for the urn—seem to reflect differences in social status. These distinctions, however, may also result from the difference in the type of death suffered by the deceased (see Karina Arifin, in Eghenter and Sellato 1999). TEST PITS IN PUJUNGAN SUBDISTRICT Three test pits were dug at the settlement site of Apau Ping and three more at the site of an abandoned settlement area (lepu’un) at Long Beraa (see Figure 11.25). Apau Ping The current village of Apau Ping is a settlement of the Kenyah Leppo’ Ké. This site, however, was once occupied by the Ngorek, and later by the Kenyah Leppo’ Ma’ut. Many polished stone adzes were found, which, according to the local people, were made by the Ngorek. Many earthenware shards were also found, part of Ngorek origin and part of Kenyah (Leppo’ Ma’ut or Leppo’ Ké) origin, although the differences between the two are still unclear. The test pits were meant to expose distinct cultural layers reflecting differences between the two ethnic groups and to identify types of arte- facts characteristic of these groups, since the context of the many artefacts (stone adzes and earthenware) collected from the villagers’ hands is not known. The test pits were expected to contribute more explicit preliminary information, both vertically and horizontally, regarding the Ngorek. Three spots were selected. Test Pit I shows a structure of burnt clay resembling brick on the surface, which according to the villagers was made by the Ngorek. Test Pit II was dug in a spot where, according to the villagers, houses had stood since Ngorek times. Due to this spot’s higher elevation, complete cultural layers could be exposed and numerous stone tools and earthenware shards were found nearby (for a terminology of the parts of earthenware containers, see Figure 11.36). The location of Test Pit III, at the highest ground elevation, has also once been occupied by the Ngorek, and </page> <page sequence="30"> 228 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH earthenware and stone adzes were also found on the surface. During the 1992 survey, a test pit had been dug by Kiwok Rampai not far from Test Pit III, in the yard of a lower-lying house. Figure 11.36 Pottery Terminology LIP RIM NECK RIDGE BODY BOTTOM Test Pit I The 1 x 1m test pit consists of five lots. It reveals a ‘brick structure’ forming two hollows of, respectively, 40 x 30 cm (to the south) and 60 x 30 cm (to the north). The bottom and sides consist of layers of hard brick. The outer walls are less hard and their colour shifts from bright red to brown and finally fades into the colour of the surrounding soil. In the hollows, river stones, charcoal particles, and earthenware shards were found. One of the river stones, of unclear function, has a round side covered by a layer of greenish yellow glaze. The base of the hollows is greenish brown and rippled and is impermeable to water, maybe the result of high temperatures at burning. Earthenware shards, all from the bodies of containers, are red, grey, and black, with a temper of crushed earthenware. One shows string decoration. No dis- tinct soil layers or other artefacts were found that could be used as markers of cultural layers. Test Pit II Test Pit II is 1.5 x 1.5m and consists of three lots. Lot 1 consists of disturbed black soil containing stones and 68 pottery shards (including 1 ridge, 1 neck, and 1 rim). In Lot 2, an earthenware artefact of unclear function, with a temper of coarse crushed pottery was found. The bottom of Lot 2 is a layer of dense yellow soil with black pellets and chunks of river stones, and one piece of dark grey pottery with a coarse temper. The bottom of Lot 3 (75 cm deep) displayed a sterile layer of yellow soil mixed with black pellets. Test Pit III, thus, shows a single cultural layer. Lot 1 yielded 640 gr of earthenware shards, generally rather small (less than 2 cm), and Lot 2 only revealed one shard (5 cm). The thickness of the shards varies from 0.3 to 1.1 cm. The temper is of crushed earthenware (from fine to coarse, with a maximum of 0.4 cm), or sand with grains still visible, indicating a low firing temperature. The pottery is orange, reddish grey, or black. It does not always have an outside layer of resin, but occasionally the inside is covered by such a layer. One shard shows a straight rim, similar to the form manufactured by the villagers today. No decorated earthenware was found. </page> <page sequence="31"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 229 Test Pit III Test Pit III is 1.25 x 1.25 m and consists of four lots. Lot 1 shows crumbly soil with chunks of river stones, 3 unpolished basalt adzes, small flakes of basalt, animal teeth, charcoal, and small pellets of batu bala (literally, red rocks, natural red ochre mixed with water and used for painting coffins, house walls, or shields). The earthenware (3 kg of small shards) includes 594 pieces of container bodies, 53 ridges, 65 necks, and 34 rims. Lot 2 yielded earthenware shards and chunks of river stone, batu bala, 2 flakes of basalt, and one polished basalt adze with one of its edges reworked. The earthenware (1.6 kg) consists of 286 pieces of container body, 53 ridges, 22 necks, and 23 rims. In Lot 3, the dense brown soil contains basalt flakes, several chunks of yellow and red ochre, and small river stones. The earthenware (less than 1 kg) consists of 216 pieces of the body, 30 ridges (Figures 11.37 and 11.38), 8 necks, and 6 rims (Figures 11.39 and 11.40). In Lot 4, the soil is still of the same type, and the earthenware (0.5 kg) consists of 87 pieces of the body, 19 ridges, 9 necks, and 4 rims, as well as pieces of white earthenware. Furthermore, two basalt adzes were found at a depth of 82 cm. The test pit ended with a layer of sterile yellow soil at a depth of 94 cm. Thus, a single cultural layer was found, which did not show any sublayers.

A layer of resin is often found, either on the outside or the inside. Some pottery polished to a black shine was found, as well as another type, yellowish or greyish red on the outside and black on the inside. The temper generally consists of finely crushed pottery. Some pottery with a sand temper with quartz grains still visible indicates a low firing temperature. More than half the pottery is decorated, generally with a string pattern obtained by beating the pot with a paddle wrapped in string with varying diameter (see Figures 11.41 and 11.42). The straight rim of one container shows another technique of string decoration, made by impressing a string around the neck. A decorative pattern of boxes (squares or diamonds) is also found, made with a wooden paddle incised with crossed lines. The lip may be decorated with a motif of deep scratches around the edge. On the pot’s body, decoration may be restricted to the bottom part, below the ridge, or to the part from the ridge to just below the rim. One of the pottery, showing a neck forming an angle, is decorated with a string pattern interrupted just below that angle. Long Beraa The Long Beraa site, located on the second terrace from the river bank, is an old Ngorek settlement site (lepu’un) and has been occupied again by the Kenyah Leppo’ Ma’ut in the 1940s. This is an ideal location, because the flat is extensive, with a nearby hill suitable for defence. Many earthenware shards are found on the ground surface, as well as fruit trees (rambutan and candlenuts). Test pits were opened in three locations. </page> <page sequence="33"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 231 Figure 11.41 Pattern made by Figure 11.42 Pattern made by thin string wrapped around a paddle thick string wrapped around a paddle 0 2 cm Test Pit I Test Pit I, measuring 1 x 1m, is located on a flat covered with grass and a few trees and consists of three lots. Lot 1 shows crumbly black soil mixed with roots, charcoal, shards of foreign ceramic, and earthenware shards (less than 0.5 kg) consisting of 30 parts of container body, 3 necks, and 5 rims. There is also one pot bottom with a thickness of 2 cm (110 gr), thought to be part of a large container. The local people, however, claim that they have never seen one so thick. Batu bala is also present. In Lot 2, still denser yellow soil contains river stones, charcoal, and orange and grey pottery shards (200 gr) consisting of 11 shards of body, 4 necks, and 1 rim, with a temper of crushed earthenware and very coarse sand (0.5 cm). In the upper part of Lot 3, a grey soil layer yielded one shard of a pot body and charcoal particles, and is gradually replaced with dense yellow soil. Lot 3 ends with a sterile yellow layer at a depth of 60 cm. Test Pit II In a flat overgrown with ferns and dense tall Imperata grass, Test Pit II, measuring 1 x 1m, consists of 2 lots. In Lot 1, crumbly black soil with charcoal particles yielded 7 chunks of batu bala (200 gr) and pottery consisting of 15 shards of container body, 4 necks, and 4 rims. Downward, the soil becomes sandy with fine grey soil pellets, and at the bottom of the lot it is mixed with yellow soil. Lot 2 was dug only 18 cm deep to check the underlying soil in the south of the square. At its bottom, the soil is still black and contains charcoal particles and earthenware (200 gr) consisting of 11 shards of container body, 4 necks, and 1 rim. Small chunks of batu bala were also found. The yellow soil layer appears to be sterile. Test Pit III Test Pit III, measuring 1 x 1m, is located at the end of a flat area overgrown with thick fern and it consists of three lots. In Lot 1 below the humus, a black sandy soil mixed with charcoal yielded earthenware shards (100 gr) comprising 15 shards of container body, 1 neck, and 1 rim, as well as pieces of glass and bottles, pieces of tin plates, river stones, and todan (a sort of resin). Lot 2 consists of dense yellow and brown soil with no charcoal or artefacts at all. Lot 3 was dug in the middle of the square to examine a spot of dark grey crumbly soil to a depth of 17 cm, possibly the remains of </page> <page sequence="34"> 232 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH a house stilt. The pottery is reddish orange and dark grey, some showing remains of a resin layer, and the temper is coarsely crushed pottery. Straight rims indicate a rather closed type of pot, like that still made by the local people today. Not a single shard of decorated pottery was found. Conclusion The two sites display similar features, i.e., a black upper layer containing charcoal and artefacts (primarily pottery), and a yellow, sterile substratum. In between are transition layers of black and yellow soils, frequently still containing artefacts. The upper layer does not show distinctive sublayers that could be viewed as representing two or more different cultural layers. It is thus difficult to identify or distinguish between the groups that manufactured the artefacts recovered. The Kenyah never manufactured basalt tools and always insist that these were made by the Ngorek, which leads to the conclusion that the stone tools in Test Pit III at Apau Ping were made by the Ngorek. The problem is different with regard to the pottery shards found everywhere. Without a clear differentiation of cultural layers, there is no indication to determine who made these pots. Although the people of Apau Ping tend to state that these shards are of Ngorek origin, they themselves, to this day, still produce earthenware (see Sellato 1997a). ANALYSIS OF ARTEFACTS FOUND IN APAU PING Research on the artefacts found in the Apau Ping area in 1991–92 was conducted in Jakarta. These artefacts consisted primarily of stone implements and pottery shards, and a few shards of foreign ceramic ware and pieces of iron. Stone tools The stone tools investigated totalled 205 pieces. They can be classified as adze, pounder, gouge, scraper, and sharpening stone. Adzes form the largest group (59 items)—to which should be added 42 unpolished adzes. A large number of broken basalt tools could not be classified. Adzes Figure 11.43 Terminology of the These adzes generally are elongated with a adze: a) upper surface; b) longi- quadrangular cross section, and are finely tudinal section; c) lower surface; polished all over (see Figure 11.43). A cutting 1) butt; 2) cutting edge edge is made by abrading the extremity of 1 the tool, giving a sharper slant to the extremity of the lower surface. They vary in size from 4 to 25 cm. They can be divided into eight ty- pes according to shape. It should be noted that this typology is essentially descriptive and does not carry implications regarding differences in the functions of the tools. Type A (23 items; see Figure 11.44): the upper surface rises from a narrow butt towards 2 the centre of the tool and broadens increasingly A B C </page> <page sequence="35"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 233 Figure 11.44 Typology of stone adzes from the upper Bahau, type A 0 3 cm Type A Subtype A1 0 3 cm 0 3 cm Subtype A2 Subtype A3 0 3 cm 0 3 cm Subtype A4 Subtype A5 </page> <page sequence="36"> 234 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH to form the cutting edge, which forms a convex triangle on the upper surface (see this type in Duff 1970). Type A adzes have been divided into five subtypes on the basis of their cutting edge and their section. A1 (13 items; 5.3–12.6 cm long): the cutting edge is formed from the convex upper surface, whereas the lower surface is flat. The longitudinal section displays a flat lower surface and a convex upper surface A2 (7 items; 6.1–11.4 cm long): the longitudinal section is almost identical to that of A1, but both surfaces have been abraded to form the cutting edge. A3 (1 item; 7.0 cm long): the butt does not much differ in width from the cutting edge, which was formed from the flat upper surface, whereas the lower surface is rather convex. A4 (1 item; 11.6 cm long): the cutting edge was formed by abrasion of both the lower and upper surfaces, which are both convex. A5 (1 item; 9.0 cm long): the cutting edge was formed from the upper surface, while the lower surface is rather convex. Type B (21 items; see Figure 11.45): The upper surface is convex, whereas the lower surface, from which the cutting edge was formed, is flat. The butt is not significantly narrower than the edge (see this type in Duff 1970). According to variation in the cutting edge, four subcategories are distinguished. B1 (6 items; 7.8–11.2 cm long): the upper surface is convex while the lower surface is flat; the cutting edge is formed from the lower surface. B2 (8 items; 4.8–15.6 cm long): the cutting edge clearly shows a triangular shape. B3 (4 items; 10.1–14.7 cm long): the cutting edge is shorter and thus steeper. B4 (3 items; 8.5–9.5 cm long): the upper surface is rather convex and the lower surface is flat; the cutting edge is short.

Type D (6 items; 7.7–10.6 cm long): the upper surface is convex while the lower surface is flat; the cutting edge was formed from the lower surface, and is narrower than the butt. Type E (2 items; 11.1–11.7 cm long): the lower surface is flat while the upper surface is slightly convex; the cutting edge was formed from the lower surface, and is wider than the butt; the sides of the tool are polished, and the butt is also polished to form a square. Type F (3 items; 10.1– 13.8 cm long): the upper surface is convex, while the lower surface is flat; the cutting edge, formed from the lower surface, somewhat widens, while the butt is rounded.

Pottery and Ceramics Figure 11.48 Stone pounder from the upper Bahau These finds are distinguished into local earthenware and foreign ceramics. The analysis is based on the analytical methods 0 6 cm for pottery described by Wahyudi (1985). Local Earthenware The basic material is clay, but some pieces are made from clay mixed with lime. The clay, with a high iron content, is grey, black, or red. Low-temperature firing results in a coarse earthenware, whereas fine earthenware results from medium- temperature firing. The tempers are sand and crushed earthenware. The technique used is hand modelling (for terminology, see 0 6 cm Figure 11.36), and finger imprints are found on several earthenware shards. At the end of the manufacturing process, a brushing technique was applied, which may have used straw, leaving fine lines visible on the pot’s body. Pressure techniques of decoration were also used, employing paddles wrapped in string, resulting in lines whose width depended on the size of the string. Some very thick black shards of a container’s body may have belonged to a metal-smelting container. </page> <page sequence="39"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 237 A total number of 676 shards included 7 pieces of black or grey, undecorated rims, with an open, straight, or closed angle, with a mouth diameter of 8 to 18 cm; 1 piece of black ridge with line decoration, manufactured by the hand modelling technique; 182 pieces of grey, black, or red container body, plain or decorated with (thick or thin) lines made with a paddle wrapped with string (see Figures 11.41 and 11.42); 6 shards of smelting containers, black and undecorated; and 487 unidentified undecorated shards. Foreign Ceramics This category includes all shards of glazed, white or pale blue, kaolin base. From a total number of nine shards, 1 is a rim shard with a flower motif under the glaze, an open angle, and a probable diameter of 21 cm (possibly from a plate); 3 bottom shards, plain or decorated with floral motif under the glaze, one of which contains a factory mark which could not be clearly read (only a crown is visible); and 5 unidentified pieces with floral motif under the glaze. MEGALITHIC GRAVES: A SUMMARY The surveys that were carried out indicated differences in the form of the burial structures in the four subdistricts visited. In Long Pujungan, the graves generally consisted of stone urn-dolmens in various forms, but a few menhirs were also found, usually erected near graves. In Kerayan, two forms are known, the batu terupun (or perupun, pelepuun) and a type of urn-dolmen with a ceramic jar container, as well as a number of menhirs. So far, no stone burials have been found in Malinau where, instead, there are grave monuments made of wood and including ceramic jars. In Kayan Hulu, the most common burial container is a rectangular stone trough. This last subdistrict, however, will not be discussed in this summary. Pujungan Subdistrict The urn-dolmen burial structure (Figure 11.2) basically consists of a stone urn, standing on short stone pillars or blocks or directly on the ground, and covered with a flat stone (lid or cover). This container is protected by a dolmen consisting of several stone pillars supporting a large stone slab (the roof or table). The term urn-dolmen was coined by Schneeberger (1979). The materials used generally can be found in the vicinity of the grave, yet, in some cases they must have been carried from rather far away. The container and its lid, as well as a number of dome-shaped dolmen roofs, consist of medium-to-coarse-grained feldspatic sandstone of Cretaceous age. This rock formation is found in several locations, for example, on the Ngiam River and at Kiam Bio’. Many stone slabs which have been made into dolmen tables consist of Cretaceous siliceous siltstones or fine-grained sandstones, found along the length of the Bahau River. The pillars of the graves were made of whatever type of stone was available (Sellato 1995c). The form of the structures varies significantly. For example, the cylindrical containers, found at Ka Tempu and Lepu’un Nyibun and reaching 1.5 m in height, apparently had not been protected by a dolmen, but only by a stone slab as a cover. The shape of the stone container also varies. Its mouth may be rectangular, oval, or circular, while its bottom is round. The rectangular containers found at Long Pulung </page> <page sequence="40"> 238 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND RESEARCH and Long Lenjau Ca have a base smaller than their opening, so that their walls slope. The pillars may resemble a square beam, or be somewhat convex (‘onion skin’), or just retain the natural shape of the stone used. There are also pillars of rectangular stone (e.g., at Long Tela’u), or made of carefully processed and shaped flat slabs (e.g., at Long Beraa). So far, only two carved stone graves have been found (Long Pulung and Ka Tempu). The size of the graves, too, varies. The highest is 2 m, with its container alone reaching 1 m in length. Yet, more commonly found are graves about 50 cm high. Near or attached to large structures are occasionally a number of smaller structures, seeming to form a cluster, as in Long Berini. Ceramic jars are also found, placed between the pillars of large stone urn-dolmens. The differences in the size and layout of the grave structures are thought to indicate status differences. Ceramic jars were found at several sites, placed on the ground, or sometimes partly buried to prevent them from toppling. At Long Berini, a broken ceramic jar was located on the ground, enclosed by a ring of stone slabs slanting as if covering the jar. The various ceramic jars found as parts of stone burial structures in the Long Pujungan area still await identification with regard to their origins and age. Some have been identified as 18–19th century Chinese jars, such as the rather common brown jars with dragon motif and the jars with four ears and two rows of protruding pegs underneath (Sellato 1995c). A number of jars with a red paste, coarse temper, and black lead glaze, originated from 15–17th century Thailand or Burma (see Manguin 1995). Kerayan Subdistrict Here, too, a variety of burial structures are found. At Sungai Bulu and Sungai Kuyur, ceramic jars are often used as burial containers, and placed inside a square chamber of rectangular stone slabs with relatively straight edges and of even thickness; the chamber was covered with a stone slab. The only stone urn found was unique in that it had been carved to resemble a ceramic jar, complete with ears. At Sungai Bulu, a triangular stone pillar carved with a human form had been set up in one of the inside corners of the stone chamber—a similar carving was found on the surface of a stone cropping out on the bank of the Kerayan River upstream from Tang La’an. The graves of Sungai Kuyur and Sungai Bulu seem to represent a specific form, which may be widespread in the Kerayan Hulu region. In the area of Kerayan Darat, the common grave structure is the batu terupun (or perupun, pelepuun), a large dolmen made of stone slabs reaching 2 m in length and 1 m in width, erected on a heap of river stones. Several stones stand alone, both rectangular pillars (menhirs) and flat slabs. At Terang Baru, for example, several stone slabs had been erected in the ground as markers of the village, the church, or something else. Very likely, in the Kerayan Darat area, these slabs were formerly part of a dolmen structure. For example, one pillar of a batu terupun in Pa’ Api has been moved to the edge of the football field to be erected as a village marker. In the Kerayan Hulu area (e.g., at Tang La’an), several tall menhirs clearly had not been part of a dolmen structure. Malinau District The grave structures here are made of large wooden beams, yet their construction and their function are reminiscent of the megalithic structures in other districts. The same is true of the burial structure of the Nyibun people—a large wooden post supporting </page> <page sequence="41"> Karina Arifin and Bernard Sellato 239 a ceramic jar containing human bones—which seems to represent a sequel to the tradi- tion of the stone structures. It may be guessed that the use of stone as construction material for graves does not only depend on the local traditions, but also on the availability of the materials. A shortage of stone of the right type does not mean, however, that a community must abandon its tradition of megalithic structures. In the Kerayan area, for example, the large stone slabs used in the batu terupun must have been brought there from a rather distant area. It must be asked why some people stopped building megalithic graves, even though the underlying ideas persisted. It is also possible that an important change in social structure caused the abandonment of the megalithic tradition, so that the stone burial structures were replaced with wooden ones. Further Research The test pits dug at two former Ngorek settlement sites (Apau Ping and Long Beraa) did not show distinct cultural layers. It was possible, however, to determine differences in the types of artefacts, especially with regard to the basalt tools and the earthenware. Further surveys of other settlement sites are needed to determine their size, characteristics, and environment, before selecting some for excavation. Further surveys should also focus on cave sites, to obtain a better picture of their types, morphology, and distribution, before test pits or true excavations begin. Extension work should be performed among the local people regarding the protection and preservation of archaeological remains in their regions, in order to protect the sites and prevent further destruction. This is also important for inducing pride and a feeling of ownership regarding these historic monuments among the villagers, who so far do not understand their significance. </page> </plain_text>
