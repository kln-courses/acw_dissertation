<plain_text><page sequence="1">NIJINSKY The dive could come who was its fledgling first Of wings that feathered ankles and stood up And leapt and wide in the deep air immersed The body that came down as soul went up And taught the throat the foremost wind: and back The living blood curved in the fluid hand Whose fingers paused, and poised: the deadened slack Was time's who stopped to see a dancer stand Where sky was ... There was God, where man was not And heat in the heaving heart that moved alone And left like a lover the still, praying spot To surge where there were only air and bone But once, as a mere odor comes and goes, Dream: and the great anthropomorphic rose.
