<plain_text><page sequence="1">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY* III. CONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS It seems fairly obvious in view of the discussion in the first part of this article that, despite the lack of any overwhelming finality in con- clusions drawn from the existing decisions, the tendency of the courts is more and more to extend vicarious corporate criminal liability, both as to shareholders on the one hand, and directors, officers, and their sub- ordinates on the other. There is no great probability that the juristic basis for and limits to such criminal liability will ever be settled by the courts only as a phase of what may be called the common law of cor- porations. The reason for this is that already legislatures are covering the field with statutory enactments upon the subject. However, there is considerable probability that the basis and limits of the criminal liability of a director, officer, or employee of a corporation, as well as that of a shareholder, will be settled by the courts as a phase of constitutional or statute law in passing upon the various legislative enactments pro- viding for such liability. It is here that the cases already discussed in the first part of this article should play their part, for the inarticulated considerations that led in them to the imposition vel non of vicarious corporate criminal liability are in all probability the same considerations that, in a more developed and fully considered form, the courts will apply in testing under the due process clause the reasonableness of sim- ilar impositions by statute. So far as the shareholders are concerned, the statutory imposition of a vicarious criminal liability has already met with judicial approval. In New York Central R. R. v. United States117 the criminal liability of a corporation for the acts of its officers in giving rebates was sus- tained. The particular portions of the Elkins Act which read: "Every person or corporation who shall offer, grant, give or solicit, or ac- cept or receive any such rebate, concession or discrimination, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. ... "In construing and enforcing the provisions of this section, the act, omission or failure of any officer, agent or other person acting for or em- ployed by any common carrier acting within the scope of his employment shall in every case be also deemed to be the act, omission or failure of such carrier as well as of that person."" * This is the final installment of an article by Mr. Lee, the first installment of which appeared in the January issue. 7 212 U.

Mr. Justice Day's opinion, however, confines itself for the most part to citing precedents for the propositions that corporations can commit and have been held guilty of certain crimes. The decision contributes little to what seems a more useful analysis of the questions: what is the legal basis for subjecting the property interests of shareholders in the assets of a corporation to a fine for the acts of the officers of the corporation, when the share- holders have not participated in the illegal acts; and what limits, if any, rest upon judicial and legislative impositions of such vicarious corporate criminal liability. The analogous question involved in work- men's compensation19 and employers' liability legislation was answered in hardly greater detail by the court. There such impositions were sup- ported on the basis. that the common enterprise should "on grounds of natural justice" be made to devote part of its capital and earnings to compensating industrial accidents arising in its operation. The counsel for the New York Central in the Elkins Act case urged at great length that the shareholders should not be made liable for the acts of their officers. But by saying that the acts of the officers and employees are not those of the corporation, the counsel missed the crux of the matter. Of course, it is true that there are not two wrong- ful acts, one committed by the corporation, and one by its officers or employees, because acts can be committed by human beings only, the officers and employees in this case. The real question is, granted all this, can the shareholders' interest in the corporate funds be vicariously subjected to a fine because of the officers' or employees' acts? To com- plain of such a result as outraging natural justice is but an impossible attempt to make nature static.120 Indeed the same phrase, "natural jus- tice," has been the basis for sustaining the vicarious impositions in the workmen's compensation cases.121 m New York Central R.

QUAR. 542. o "But public policy certainly does not demand that a person or association should be punished by the State, through criminal proceedings, on account of a wrong committed by another. This would be contrary to the natural sense of justice. Hence it is held that where the commission of a crime involves the intention of the offender, the intention cannot be imputed by means of a fic- tion; actual intention is required. "It follows, therefore, that a corporation cannot be charged criminally with a crime involving malice, or the intention of the offender. Even though the corporators themselves should unanimously join with malice aforethought, in committing a crime as a corporate act, yet the malice would be that of the several members of the company, and not actually one malicious intention of the whole company." 2 MORAWETZ, THE LAW OF PRIVATE CORPORATIONS (2d ed. 1886) 701-2. 1 See New York Central R. R. v. White, 243 U. S. 188, 203, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, 252 (1917). 182</page><page sequence="3">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY The truth is that the nature of justice as evolved in corporation law itself, has long since become inclusive of vicarious criminal liability through the imposition of a liability upon persons other than those com- mitting the acts involved in the breach of law or participating in or authorizing them. Of course this is illustrated by the cases establish- ing the liability of corporate officers based upon their responsibility for the management of the common enterprise. But the most obvious ex- ample is that of the body of law already discussed which holds a "cor- poration" subject to a criminal liability.122 Excluding the very few cases of shareholders' authorization of or participation in the criminal acts, the facts of all these cases involve nothing more or less than the situation under the Elkins Act,-the liability of innocent shareholders for the acts of the corporate officers that in effect results from crim- inal proceedings against the corporation. And this growth of the law of corporations has recently been imitated by statutory declarations to the same effect. The Elkins Act provision is one of these, but it does not stand alone. The Federal Food and Drugs Act,123 the Grain Stand- ards Act,124 the Insecticides Act,l25 the Food Control Act,'26 the Plant Quarantine Act,127 the Clayton Anti-Trust Act,128 and the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921,129 all eliminate by use of the same language any doubt that Congress may not intend the shareholders to assume re- sponsibility for the acts and omissions of the corporate officers and employees. A second supposedly constitutional question was urged in the Elkins Act case. Counsel there unsuccessfully argued that a corporation was being subjected to a double liability'30 by virtue of the provision under discussion. Of course it is true that two elements of the enterprise are each being subjected to a different liability, the officer for his own acts and the shareholder for the acts of the officer. In Wood v. United Statesl31 the situation arose in its most aggravated form, for the presi- dent of a distilling company was also its sole shareholder. In this capacity he had forfeited his plant as the result of libel of information 12 Cf. SALMOND, JURISPRUDENCE, (4th ed. 1913) 288. 23 34 STAT. 772, ? 12 (1906), U. S.

Then in the case before it the court sustained his personal conviction and sentence based upon the same illegal acts: "If a man for his own convenience chooses to conduct any business through a corporation, he is estopped to say that he and the corporation are one person, and not two. He may not obtain for himself the limitation of liability and the other advantages which flow from the conduct of the busi- ness by the corporation and then when it suits him say that there is no dif- ference between him and the corporation. For the purposes of this case it is immaterial whether Wood owned one share of the corporate stock or all of it. If the forfeiture of the corporate property was a punishment of the stockholder whose interest in the property was thereby taken from him, the holder of one share was punished as well as the holder of all, although the extent of the punishment might differ. Stockholders, innocent or guilty of any personal participation or knowledge of the crime, suffer alike from the forfeiture of the corporate property. It certainly cannot be contended that innocent or guilty they are equally immune from other punishment. "There are many statutes which impose criminal penalties upon both corporation and individual,-as, for example, a railroad company which gives a rebate and the officer or agent who actually and knowingly conducts the transaction are made equally guilty. According to the contention of the defendant, Wood, an officer or agent of a railroad corporation which had paid a fine for allowing a rebate could not be punished for so doing, if he happened to be a stockholder in the corporation, but could if he were not. "... even if Wood had been the owner in his own name of the dis- tillery property, its forfeiture in a civil proceeding in consequence of its having been used by him to defraud the government would have been no bar to his prosecution for the personal crime committed by him." The view that a corporation cannot be imprisoned but only fined, but an individual may be both fined and imprisoned, has given rise to a third constitutional objection that any law that applies to both individ- uals and corporations and that has as penalties for its violation both fine and imprisonment, is discriminatory and unconstitutional as deny- ing equal protection of the laws. The courts in considering the diffi- culty have analyzed the problem no further than to arrive at the view that the difficulty is no fault of the statute or the legislature, but rather lies in the "inherent nature of corporations," and so the statutes are sustained.l32 While the Elkins Act case holds that the statutory impositions of criminal liability upon corporate shareholders for the acts of directors, officers, agents, and employees are not made inoperative by the Consti- tution, the limits of such impositions are still open to novel decision. 13State v. Belle Springs Creamery Co., 83 Kan. 389, 111 Pac. 474 (1910); Small &amp; Co. v. Comm., 134 Ky. 272, 120 S. W. 361 (1909). 184</page><page sequence="5">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY In those situations where the personal element in the crime is emphasized and the desire to punish the offender predominates, presumably vicari- ous liability would be more readily deemed unreasonable. Insofar as crime is considered as involving moral delinquency or turpitude, vicari- ous criminal liability runs counter to the theory that moral responsibil- ity is direct and admits of no shifting. Then it is that criminal intent is demanded. Such, for example, might be true in cases of murder and manslaughter, and more surely in perjury and treason. But with changing views of penology and a desire to prevent the recurrence of those conditions of management which urge crime on the corporate behalf, rather than to seek vengeance from the offender, the necessity for moral fault as a basis for criminal liability will more readily give way. It has also been suggested that such liability is necessitated by the fact that the frequent financial impossibility of squeezing large amounts from amerced officers makes it necessary that the corporate assets be available for public reparation.133 Again, the statement of William Draper Lewis, director of the American Law Institute, indicates important boundaries to vicarious liability: "This rule is the fundamental one which underlies all the liability which the common law imposes on one man for the acts of his business associates, whether that associate is his agent, his partner, or the director of the cor- poration in which he is a stockholder. The rule is this: One who has owner- ship in or control of a business is personally liable, unless that liability is limited by statute, for acts done in the course of and for that business."l3 The risk and burden of acts incidental to a corporate enterprise may well fall upon those who benefit by the enterprise.135 The corporate 133 .. The Court of Common Pleas lately held that a corporation might be sued in trespass; but that nobody has sought to fix them with acts of im- morality. These plainly derive their character from the corrupted mind of the person committing them, and are violations of the social duties that belong to men and subjects. A corporation, which, as such, has no such duties, cannot be guilty in these cases, but they may be guilty as a body corporate of com- manding acts to be done to the nuisance of the community at large .... "We are told that this remedy is not required, betause the individuals who concur in voting the order, or in executing the work, may be made answerable for it by criminal proceedings. Of this there is no doubt. But the public know nothing of the former, and the latter, if they can be identified, are commonly persons of the lowest rank, wholly incompetent to make any reparation for the injury. There can be no effectual means of deterring from an oppressive exer- cise of the power for the purpose of gain, except the remedy by indictment against those who truly commit it, that is, the corporation, acting by its majority; and there is no principle which places them beyond the reach of the law for such proceedings."

This fact of delegated or repre- sentative action which is the underlying principle in the conduct of practically all corporate activity, forms the nexus leading to the policy of vicarious liability. From it also comes the limitation that the cor- porate shareholders are liable criminally only for acts of officers, di- rectors, or employees which could reasonably be conceived of as having been undertaken in the corporate interest and which were done by an officer, director, or employee to whom was delegated the power to repre- sent the corporation in that particular field of activity in which the criminal act occurs.136 These plastic considerations are, of course, but suggestions as to an attitude of approach rather than the inflexible categories that result with judicial experience. It seems obvious, how- ever, that no moral basis exists for such criminal liability. Rather, the basis is that entrance into an associated enterprise and acceptance of its benefits carries with it the burden of jural liability for the conduct of that enterprise. The shareholder is invested with a capacity besides that of a pas- sive recipient of the benefits that accrue to the association. He also in a small degree participates in the actual control and management of the enterprise. Usually this participation is limited to voting. If the shareholder is in the minority upon any question, it means that a vicari- ous liability may result to him if the authorization of the majority is illegal.137 Though he dissents and opposes the illegal authorization, the theory of majority rule subjects him to criminal liability regardless of 16 The disclaimer of ultra vires means no more than that the act was beyond the lawful acting capacity granted the corporation by law and not that it was either beyond the physical acting capacity of its representatives nor beyond the possibility of being done in the corporate benefit. Cf. Salt Lake City v. Hol- lister, 118 U. S. 256, 260-1 (1886). 187 "Where a collective body of men have a right to act in a matter which concerns the common interest, it seems to be the first suggestion of reason, that an act done by simple majority should be binding on the whole; this is the principle of the rule adopted by the common law of England, with respect to aggregate corporations . . . for it frequently happens that the power of action does not extend to the corporation at large, but is confined to a select body; and then the act of the majority of that select body binds not only the whole of the select body, but the whole corporation. "In different corporations, too, the manner in which the majority shall be reckoned varies according to the provisions of the constitution; sometimes the act that is to bind the corporation must be sanctioned by the assent of an ab- solute majority of the whole body empowered to act; sometimes it is sufficient if a majority of the whole body be assembled, and the majority of those as- sembled agree to the act; and sometimes a majority of those assembled, whether those assembled be a majority of the whole or not, may bind the whole cor- porate body. "In all these several cases, the act of the major part, which is to bind the rest, must be done at one and the same time, and at a regular meeting held for that purpose." 1 KYD, THE LAW OF CORPORATIONS (1793) 308-9. 186</page><page sequence="7">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY the virtue of his stand. The reason for placing such a liability upon a minority member is the necessity that society should possess an effective method of control over those who assume responsibility for the man- agement of the corporation by agreeing to be bound by any temporary majority. Today, however, the shareholders frequently have nothing more than theoretical power to influence corporate affairs. Boards of di- rectors and higher officials exercise discretion for the most part un- limited so far as internal restraints are concerned. In consequence fines paid from surplus earnings intended to benefit shareholders will not serve as a check upon unlawful acts of management to the same extent as will penalties imposed vicariously upon those directors and officers who direct the offender's activities more immediately than do the shareholders. The constitutionality of the few statutes, which are as yet upon the books and which impose a vicarious criminal liability upon corporate directors and officers, has not up to this time been determined by the courts. Presumably, however, there are limits within which the jural liability of a director or officer for the execution of duties imposed upon the corporation and for the supervision of acts of subordinate em- ployees, extends. For instance, how immediate or remote may this control over subordinates be and yet preserve a criminal liability for their acts? The shareholder is liable for criminal acts of his officers and employees and yet his control over them is usually, as we have seen, of the greatest possible remoteness. This may perhaps be explained on the ground that the shareholder has the beneficial interest in the corporation. Boards of directors exercise a varying degree of control over management, but in a case where they were practically uncon- cerned with corporate affairs, they were held liable because of their general responsibility for management.138 However, some actual con- trol over the particular phase of management or the subordinate in question must exist, as is instanced by the refusal to hold a treasurer of a corporation for the hiring by an employee of a child below the age limit prescribed by the child labor law when the treasurer had no con- trol over the hiring of help.139 Rephrased, this would mean that an officer is liable for the acts of only those subordinates in his own line of duty. Consequently a more widespread liability would rest upon those officers nearer the top of the pyramid of executives. Where the Rex v. Medley, 6 Car. &amp; Payne 292 (1834).

Y. 1882), where the treasurer of the New York Sun had at least a remote control over the insertion of ad- vertisements but yet was not held liable. 187</page><page sequence="8">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW situation takes a negative aspect, as in case of the failure of the cor- poration to perform a statutory duty because the performance of that duty had not been assigned to any officer or employee for performance, the liability rests upon those higher officers whose duty it is to apportion the executive functions. But if the duty has been properly delegated, then the chief executive may not be made the sacrifice for the corporate sins. In People v. Brainard the president of Harper and Bros., Pub- lishers,140 was convicted of a violation of a statute penalizing possession of an obscene book by any "person." The facts show that the book was approved by a literary conference of some of the officers of the publishing company, that the president was not a member of the con- ference, and that he was absent from the country at the time and had no knowledge of the approval, subsequent publishing, and possession of the book by the company. In consequence the court refused to construe the statute as applying to the president, and so imposing a vicarious liability upon him as chief executive, but on the contrary, reversed the conviction. Finally, of course, the principle running through all delegated ac- tion will apply;-the act in question must be such as could reasonably be conceived of as a furtherance of that portion of management delegated to the doer, i.e., within his scope of employment. The paucity of controlling decisions will give the courts an oppor- tunity to apply a realistic viewpoint in developing the law of officers' responsibility for the management of incorporated enterprises. For this development the court will need presented for its consideration those facts of internal administration which will enable it to determine the control which the various officials possess over the phase of faulty management involved. Before a vicarious criminal liability should be sustained in a particular case, there must be answered such questions as, does the default in question fall under a delegated and apportioned phase of management, or has the duty in question been left unassigned; does an officer or employee, other than the defendant, exist in whom the particular phase of management is more immediately vested; to what extent does the corporate organization permit a superior to delegate his more general authority to be actively performed by subordinates; and has the officer a discretion in determining the method of handling situations that arise in his field of duty or does he act under some degree of coercion applied by his superior officer, a director, or a powerful stockholder. 140 192 App. Div. 816, 183 N.

E. 1039 (1914). 188</page><page sequence="9">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY What we have to deal with is a phase of administrative law in its broader sense. All associations from the State down operate by virtue of an internal scheme of administration. If the law seeks to hold liable one or another element within that association for acts occurring in the execution of the enterprise, it should do so with careful considera- tion of the relation of that element to the whole enterprise. The nation operates through subordinate units of administration based more often than not upon other than geographical considerations,-political par- ties, clubs, unions, railroads, banks, churches, unofficial "movements," farmers' associations, and the like, as well as cities, counties, and states. And when such lesser spheres receive legal recognition, as in the case of incorporation, the administrative law of public officers must meet with an analogous body of law, in part comprising the liability of cor- porate directors, officers, and employees to the individual citizen in tort or to the citizens as a whole in criminal proceedings. IV. LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS The problem of choosing language that is effective and accurately discriminating in imposing criminal liability upon various members of a corporate personnel, particularly officers, is a problem facing the lawyer in formulating practically all present day legislation. Assuming that the statutory duty or prohibition is intended to rest upon the in- corporated enterprise as well as individuals, how can the statute be framed so as clearly to indicate which element, the shareholders or the executive personnel, is to be held criminally liable and subjected to the penalties. Ordinarily there is a gross inability to determine the intent of the statute in this respect as well as uncertainty in applying its pro- visions. A Kansas decision, City of Wyandotte v. Corrigan,141 illustrates the difficulty that may arise from imposing statutory duties upon "any person or corporation." The Kansas statute made it "unlawful for any person or persons, firm or corporation to engage in any business without first having and paying a license so to do. Whoever shall violate the preceding provisions by engaging in any business named without first having taken out a license shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor." Under this statute the general manager of a local traction com- pany was held criminally liable because of the failure of his corpora- tion to take out a license. The court found that the manager as well as the corporation was engaged in the business of operating a trolley line, and thus became a violator of the statute. In effect this decision 4135 Kans. 21, 10 Pac. 99 (1886). 189</page><page sequence="10">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW would seem to compel the court to reason that duties imposed upon "persons, . . . or corporations" do not, where a corporation is involved, rest merely upon the shareholders in criminal proceedings against the corporation, but such statutes are to be interpreted as imposing such duties also directly upon the individual officers. Normally, it is submitted, such a phrase as "person or corporation" is to be considered as a legislative attempt to distinguish between enter- prises which are incorporated and those conducted without incorpora- tion, in order to make both subject to the statute; and not to include a distinction between officers of the corporation and the corporation as a whole in order to enforce a double liability, i.e., upon the officer per- sonally for his own acts or omissions, or vicariously for the acts of his subordinates, as well as upon the shareholders. And a similar conclu- sion would seem to follow as to the normal meaning in the common case where "person" is held by judicial decisions or defined by legislative enactment as including a corporation. That this is the normal interpre- tation of the terms "person or corporation" or "person" is strengthened by the fact that the majority of the cases involving the liability of offi- cers under such statutory impositions of duties upon persons or corpora- tions, have found it necessary either to go into the question of the liability of an officer as arising from his responsibility for management or to employ the fiction of accessory to or conspirator with the corpora- tion, rather than to place the decision upon the basis that the statute itself puts such liability directly upon the officer.142 It is apparent that the judicial and legislative expedients of de- fining "person" to include "corporation," do not aid in solving the problem of making certain and specific the individuals from whom the penalties for corporate criminal liability are to be exacted. Penalty statutes should in consequence draw a distinction between the three cases of imposing liabilities, first, directly upon the individuals who are guilty of acts or omissions in violation of the law, second, vicariously upon the shareholders, and third, vicariously upon directors, officers, or employees. First. If the penalty is intended to rest only upon the individual who commits a positive act of violation and not upon his superior offi- cers, or the shareholders, the simple statement that any "individual" 14Rex v. Hays, 14 Ont. L. Rep. 201 (1907); Overland Cotton Mills Co. v. People, 32 Colo. 263, 75 Pac. 924 (1904); State v. Burnam, 71 Wash. 199, 128 Pac. 218 (1912); People v. Clark, 8 N'. Y. Crim. 179, 14 N.

But "every person" in the Sherman Anti- Trust Act has been the basis of convicting corporation officers of conspiracy. See, U. S. v. Young &amp; Holland Co., 170 Fed. 110 (C. C. R. I. 1909); see also Elkins Act, 32 STAT. 847, ? 1 (1903). 190</page><page sequence="11">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY who does the prohibited act is to be held criminally liable, would suffice. The term "individual" would be better used than the almost universal "person," because the latter has come to include artificial as well as natural persons, and its use, as we have seen, would immediately give rise to ambiguity in case the individual is a member of the corporate personnel. Frequently in the case of a corporate violation it is, however, de- sirable not to hold liable any officer or employee who commits the pro- hibited act as, for instance, delivering an illegal issue of securities or charging an unlawful freight rate, but to hold liable only those superior officers who cause or order or whose negligence permits the prohibited act or omission. If the term "person" is the sole designation as to those who are intended to be subject to the statutory penalties in the case of a corporate violation, the penalty may then rest only upon some underling who actually commits the acts which are the subject mat- ter of the violation because his position depends on his obedience to the responsible superior. The courts have shown some leniency, however, towards subordinate employees placed in such a predicament. For instance, a federal court in United States v. Mullen143 refused to hold liable a railway agent who collected a freight rate in accordance with the published tariff of the Company but in violation of the Inter- state Commerce Act. And in State v. Parsons,l44 while the foreman who had exclusive charge of filling oil barrels was held properly in- dicted for unlawful refilling, nevertheless the Missouri jury refused to convict the laborer who actually refilled the barrels. The court sug- gested that this refusal may have been the result of the jury's feeling that such a subordinate employee is subject to coercion and so he would doubtless lose his job if he failed to obey the illegal order of the fore- man. Under circumstances such as these the statute should in the case of a corporate violation specify what classes of members of the corpo- rate personnel are to be held personally liable for their own corporate acts which are in contravention of the statute. There are, however, a few examples of federal statutes and doubt- less many state statutes in which prohibitions are placed specifically upon the corporate officers in general or else upon those officers con- trolling the particular phase of management involved in the violation. Thus any director, officer, trustee, lessee, agent, receiver, or person acting for or employed by a common carrier is liable for any act or omission on his part in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act;145 1 53 Fed. 229 (D.

Similarly, liability for excessive campaign contributions by a corpora- tion is limited to its directors and officers who consented to such con- tributions.147 The president, general manager, or other chief officer of a corporation are those responsible for a failure to report to the director of the census the amount of tobacco owned by the corpora- tion.148 And the officer or employee to whom the corporation has as- signed the responsibility for making its tax returns or paying its taxes when due, is the one liable for the failure to make such return or pay- ment.149 In these last two statutes, if the customary language "any per- son who fails" were used, every member of the corporate executive personnel from the chairman of the board of directors to the office boy would literally be criminally liable unless "person" were held to be intended to designate only the "corporation," i.e., the shareholders in case of a corporate violation. In the Interstate Commerce Act pro- vision previously adverted to, just such a result, however, was spe- cifically declared by the statute to be the Congressional intent, although the courts in one instance at least have shown a disinclination to accept such a statement at its face value.150 Second. As to the imposition of penalties vicariously upon the shareholders, it would seem that the defining of "person" to include corporation is usually sufficient to make the shareholders vicariously liable by proceeding against the corporation and levying a fine upon their corporate interests. Nevertheless it is now common in federal legisla- tion to make certain of such liability upon the part of the shareholders by providing, for example, that, "Every person or corporation who shall offer, grant, or give or solicit, accept or receive any such rebate, concession or discrimination shall be guilty of a misdemeanor ....

This of course would mean, without further explanation, liable in the sense that the shareholders must pay a fine to be collected from their interest in the corporate assets. If it is desired to exempt the shareholders from liability, the prohibition must be directed to the corporate executive personnel alone. Third. The third case is the vicarious liability of directors, officers, and employees. Despite the doctrine of aiding and abetting the cor- porate entity in violating the law, or conspiring with it in a violation; and despite the doctrine of the responsibility of officers for corporate management; and despite the dubious authority and method of statu- tory interpretation employed in such cases as City of Wyandotte v. Kansas-it is at least doubtful whether a corporation director, officer, or employee may not in criminal proceedings (in the absence of statute or under a statute directing the prohibition against "any person" or an equivalent general expression) avoid personal liability for the proper management of the corporate affairs within lawful limits and super- vision of the acts of his subordinates, if the officer cares to force the issue before the courts. Frequently directors and officers find it finan- cially profitable to violate the law and take chances upon a comparatively unimportant corporate fine to be levied not against them but against the shareholders' interests. How, then, may the lawyer engaged in framing legislation provide that a corporate officer will be personally responsible, for instance, for the filing of the corporate income tax return, hiring and employing chil- dren under lawful age, or observing the law prohibiting monopolies in meat products. Such an attempt has been made in the Revenue Act of 1918.152 In section 1 of the Act "person" is defined to include a cor- poration, but by section 1308 (d) "person" is also defined for the pur- pose of imposing a preceding penalty to include, "An officer or employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partnership who as such officer, employee or member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs." '1Elkins Act ? 1, 32 STAT. 847 (1903), am. 34 STAT. 587 (1906), U. S. C. tit. 49, ?41. 16 40 STAT. 1143, ? 1308 (d) (1919), U. S. C. tit. 26, ?1270 (d). The same provision is to be found in the subsequent revenue Acts. 193</page><page sequence="14">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW Such provisions, however, are insufficient, for they leave untouched the question whether the internal management is so arranged that any officer or employee is immediately under the duty to perform the adt or prevent the omission in respect to which the violation occurs. It would seem that the duty to make the tax return or to employ children of the proper age, for instance, must be placed upon some individual who can be definitely ascertained, for criminal liability may rest only upon those under a definite public duty, and the necessity for certainty would pre- vent reliance upon the doctrines of general responsibility for corporate management as providing such a duty. To specify a particular officer by title, however, is impractical, for in most cases the same function is not performed in all corporations subject to the act in question by officers of uniform title. Nor can the president or chief executive, or a director, be safely designated as crim- inally liable for all statutory duties imposed upon the corporation,153 for probably the courts would find that the impracticability of such officer's actually controlling the phase of the management in question would place him in the absurd position of a sacrifice for all unlawful acts of a great corporate force. Chief Justice Holt claimed that an Act of Parliament could do anything save alter sex, and an Indiana assemblyman once attempted to eliminate parental difficulties in assist- ing in geometric problems by legislating out of existence the infinite tail of decimals that attaches to the ratio 7r; but nevertheless no law can demand that which is physically impossible and not be overthrown on one pretext or another.l54 Perhaps in a few cases the designation of the chief executive as liable for the corporate default, unless he has delegated the statutory duty so that it falls within the phase of manage- ment of an officer specified by him, would help solve such difficulty. Any remoteness of control over the phase of management involved would then be a fault of internal apportionment of duties and mal- administration, and not of the legislator; and yet any vicarious criminal liability resulting from honest errors in judgment or neglect on the part of the official making such apportionment may well be deemed un- reasonable.'55 53 This has been attempted, however, in the Merchant Marine Act, 1920. "A mortgagor who, with intent to defraud, violates any provision of sub- section F, and if the mortgagor is a corporation or association, the president or other principal executive officer of the corporation or association, shall upon conviction thereof be held guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both."

Both have been gen- eral in this application. The first instance occurs in the conference committee print of the proposed United States Cold Storage Act and reads as follows: "Sec. 13. (a) ... "(b) If any person acting for or employed by any individual, partnership, corporation, or association, negligently or willfully omits personally to perform any necessary act or properly to supervise or apportion duties among his sub- ordinates, in the execution of the authority or functions vested in him, and by reason of such omission a violation of this Act directly results, he shall be liable to all the penal and other provisions of this Act with respect to such viola- tion; but nothing in this subdivision shall be held to relieve the individual, partnership, corporation, or association from such provisions. "(c) The provisions of this section shall be held to extend and not to limit the application of section 37 or 332 of the Act entitled 'An Act to codify, revise, and amend the penal laws of the United States,' approved March 4, 1909, as amended." House Reports Nos. 1313 and 1412, 66th Cong. p. 5. See also, the bill, H.R. 7122 as introduced, 67th Cong. ? 604. The Act, however, failed of passage. In the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as reported to the House in the 66th Congress, similar language was used but was omitted from the compromise bill finally enacted in the 67th. See S. 3944 as reported to the House of Representatives, 66th Congress, ?402, and H.R. 322, ? 402. The report of the Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives, accompanying S. 3944 as reported to the House of Representatives, February 5, 1921, cites many of the cases listed in this article and reads in part as follows: "CRIMINAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS "The Senate bill in section 19, and the committee amendment in section 401, each hold the corporation liable for the acts, omissions, or failures of its officers in violation of a duty placed by law upon the corporation, and this sub- stituted liability has been held constitutional by the United States Supreme Court, New York Central Railroad v. United States (1908), 212 U. S., 480. As a result the stockholder may suffer a depreciation of his share of the assets in his pro rata amount of the fine levied, but such substituted liability does not extend to the penalty of imprisonment. (See Pharmaceutical Society v. Lon- don, etc., Supply Association (1880), 5 App. Cas., 857, 869, per Lord Black- burn.) "The committee, however, is of the opinion that the only effective method of compelling huge industrial corporations, such as the packers and stockyard operators, to comply with the law, is to compel the officers in charge of the activities of the corporation to assume personal responsibility for seeing to it that the corporate affairs are conducted in accordance with law, rather than to rely solely on holding the corporation responsible by fine. The mere fining of the corporation is not so severe but that often the corporation can easily afford, from the profits obtained from the violation, to pay any fine that may possibly result upon being proved guilty of the violation. And the stockholders despite their indirect loss either feel that a good bargain has been driven in their be- half or will find themselves too powerless to bring pressure to bear upon the officers. Again in many cases the principal officers control a majority of the stock and the realization that a pecuniary loss only will be suffered is a small preventative unless the fine authorized is so large as to make the court hesitant in imposing it. "The existing law, however, is extremely confused as to the liability of officers for the failure of the corporation to be conducted in accordance with law. If the officer actually participates by positive act of his own in the viola- tion, or so admits by demurrer, he will be held liable as an accessory (People v. Clark (1891), 8 N. Y. Crim., 179; United States v. McAndrews &amp; Forbes Co. (D. C., 1906), 149 Fed., 823. 832; sec. 332, U. S. Penal Code), or as a conspirator (People v. Duke (N'. Y., 1897), 37 Crim. App., 372; People v. Winslow (D. C., 1912), 195 Fed., 578; affirmed, 227 U. S., 302; sec. 37, U. S. Penal Code). In many cases, however, the officer acts alone and has no accomplice. If the statu- 195</page><page sequence="16">196 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW tory duty is then construed as resting only upon the corporation, as is customary in the case of a corporate act, the officer will not be liable, except in rare cases through the strained doctrine of a constructive accessory to or conspirator with the entity itself. (Kaufman v. United States (C. C. A., 1912), 217 Fed., 613; Cohen v. United States (C. C. A., 1907), 157 Fed., 651; Wood v. United States (D. C., 1913), 204 Fed., 55.) "When, however, as in the majority of cases, the officer's misconduct arises from no positive act on his part but merely the failure or omission to take the action necessary for compliance or to see to it that his subordinates take such action or that to someone is apportioned the duty of seeing to the compliance with the particular statutory requirement, the officer will in most cases be found not liable in criminal proceedings. And to this class of cases may be added those in which the actual consent to or participation in or authorization of the violation is found practically impossible of proof. The only possible existing remedy is the continued regulation of business by court injunction and the institution of contempt proceedings against individual officers for any violation of the injunction. But, as stated elsewhere in this report, the committee is of the opinion that the Federal courts and the district attorneys have not the facilities, experience, or personnel adequate for such regulation with justice either to the packer or operator or to the public. Rather such regulation should be vested in an administrative body. "It will be found that the liability of corporate officers in the type of case adverted to in the preceding paragraph has frequently been expressly limited to cases in which participation in the violation is actually proved (Rex v. Hendrie (1905), 11 Ont. L. Rep., 202; Rex v. Hays (1907), 14 Ont. L. Rep., 201), or in which consent is given to or direct knowledge had of the violation (Peo- ple v. England (N. Y., 1882), 27 Hun, 139; Crall v. Commonwealth (1905), 13 Va., 855; State v. Ross (1909), 55 Oreg., 450; State v. Carmean (1905), 126 Iowa, 291). It is true that a few cases hold liable the principal officers for de- liberate or negligent failure properly to supervise or apportion the duties to their subordinates or presume that they have given authority to their subordi- nates actually to carry on the forbidden practices in the conduct of the business along its customary lines. (United States v. Mayfield (D. C., 1910), 177 Fed., 765; Rex v. Medley (1834), 6 Car. &amp; Payne, 292; People v. White Lead Works (1890), 82 Mich., 471, 479; Cowley v. People (1881), 83 N. Y., 464, 469; State v. Burnam (1912), 71 Wash., 199; Overland Cotton Mills Co. v. People (1904), 32 Colo., 263). But the doctrine of law achieving this result is far from firmly established and the above cases are the exception to the general rule. "In order to enforce personal responsibility and prevent its being shifted either to the corporate entity or the stockholders or to some subordinate who is made the scapegoat, the committee amendment provides in section 402 that any officer, employee, agent, director, or member of the governing board of any packer, stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer, who negligently omits per- sonally to perform any necessary act, or properly to supervise or apportion the duties among his subordinates in the execution of the authority and functions vested in him by reason of such omission a violation of this act directly re- sults, he shall be liable for such violation. The Senate bill contains no corre- sponding provision and in the opinion of the committee its omission constitutes a grave weakness. The Senate bill in section 23 makes criminally liable an offi- cer of the packer who fails to obey an order of the commission. The order, however, is addressed to the packer generally and does not place any duty upon the officer positively to see to it that some of his subordinates are vested with the duty of executing the order, and are supervised so as properly to execute it. The duty would rest solely on the packer as a corporation, and even if the term 'packer' were construed to include 'officer,' just as the term 'person' is so defined by section 2 of the Senate bill, nevertheless the officer's responsibility would cease if he personally did not participate in, authorize, or consent to any posi- tive act in violation of the order." House Rept. No. 1297, 66th Cong. 3d Session (1920-21).</page><page sequence="17">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY V. APPLICATION OF THE CORPORATE ENTITY THEORY All that has been said hitherto has assumed the viewpoint em- bodied in the fairly common conception of the corporation as com- posed of two elements. One is the shareholders, the passive holders of the beneficial interest in the earnings. The other element is the ac- tive, productive service force-the directors, officers, employees of every grade-the executive personnel which more immediately directs, controls, and carries out the actual undertaking. And the relation be- tween these two elements has ordinarily been considered as analogous to that of master and servant. This doubtless in a measure explains the reason for the rather extensive vicarious criminal liability of the share- holder as compared with that of the officer or employee. But with the advent of what is termed the democratization of industry both the con- tributor of moneyed capital and the contributor of capital in the form of labor156 assume an altered position. The control over management exercised by the shareholder is minimized to an even greater extent. The subordinate employees gain a voice in the dictation of the method of determination of the rate of pay, the amount, hours of labor, sanita- tion, continuity of and dismissal from employment, training methods, and promotion.157 The result is usually a limitation of the value of the shareholders' interests and oftentimes the placing of a maximum limit upon earnings that may be distributed as dividends. Practically the entire control of management vests in the service force from the presi- dent to shipping clerk. In immense corporations such as the railroads, the conflict between the horde of small shareholders and the powerful directors and officers gives way to the conflict over the apportionment of the powers of management and control over operations between the directors and officers on the one hand and subordinate employees and officials on the other. First the officers and then the subordinates have, if the application and receipt of the corporate earnings is any test, as- sumed the character of parties in interest like the shareholders. The employees usually through elected representatives, as in shop committees and railway adjustment boards, also take a place with the 15 HENDERSON, THE POSITION OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS IN AMERICAN CON- STITUTIONAL LAW (1918) 169. 7 See, for instance, SHOP COMMITTEES AND INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS (1919), published by State Research Section of the New Jersey State Chamber of Com- merce, Newark, N.

The problem of compelling such officers and employees to assume a respon- sibility to the public for the corporate management to a degree in some wise commensurate with the control each exercises in the operation of corporate affairs and the benefits received therefrom, then becomes more necessary of solution.158 Finally there may be considered what is a useful jural conception of a "corporation"? The argument has historically taken the form of discussion of the merits of the entity theory as a fiction or as an organic reality.159 Neither view, however, seems necessary to the question of corporate criminal liability. The fact of cooperative association is real enough and the conduct of associated individuals in executing their corporate functions will differ from their conduct in executing inde- pendent unassociated functions. These facts, however, create no super- reality or personality or other psychic situation with which the law need concern itself.160 "To protect group interests as well as the interests of outsiders more adequately, and with less waste of legal effort, the corporate device has been contrived, by which the 'rights' and 'duties' of the members of the group with respect to a given transaction are replaced by a single set of rights and a single set of duties. "This corporate device is not an expression of any inherent philosophic quality in the group-of any group will, or group organism. It is no more than a convenient technical device. The interests which it is designed to protect are of course real, just as the individuals which compose the group are real. But to attribdte to the corporate 'personality' any sort of reality seems to be the most misleading anthropomorphism. A group bent on a common purpose may in a certain sense be said to have a group will. That is, the contagion of the crowd brings forth in each individual the same set of desires and emotions and inhibits the ordinary individual diversities. But a group will, in this sense of the word, has no particular relation to legal personality. A mob on a lynching bee, or a team in a football contest, both extreme examples of group will overriding individual will, do not pro- ceed to incorporate themselves before they set to work. A business firm is incorporated and accorded legal personality, merely because that is, 8 The action of the jury in State v. Parsons, 12 Mo. App. 205 (1882), may prove a balm to the followers of "labor" who may feel that under such condi- tions business may become over-democratized. ' As to the effect of corporate entity theories on the criminal liability of corporations, compare the interesting position of Prof. Canfield in holding that a corporation is a "rational fiction" and yet without express legislative enact- ment cannot be liable for crime involving a criminal intent, for the penalties really affect innocent stockholders. Canfield, Corporate Responsibility for Crime (1914) 14 COLUMBIA LAW REV. 469, 479-80. 16Hohfeld, Nature of Stockholders' Individual Liability for Corporation Debts (1909) 9 COLUMBIA LAW REV. 285, 289-90; and Corbin, Jural Relations and Their Classification (1921) 30 YALE L. J. 226, 227, note 2. 198</page><page sequence="19">CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY juristically, the most satisfactory way of achieving a desired result. The term 'legal person' is therefore in its origin fictitious, or more accurately, a metaphorical term. It was only because our habits of thought had ac- customed us to consider persons as the only subjects of rights and duties that the corporation has been termed a legal person. Its legal personality is entirely a creature of law. So indeed is all legal personality, even of human beings. If we wish to confine the term 'corporation' to this purely legal creation, the legal personality, we cannot quarrel with Marshall's famous definition. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to call the legal entity a fic- tion-it is no more fictitious than any other legal concept, a right, a contract, a title-but it is certainly no more than a creature of the law."' Nor has the opposing view, namely, that while the corporate entity is not an organic reality or personality, but merely a fiction, neverthe- less the fiction is necessary to effective jural conceptions, been produc- tive of any valuable results, at least in that portion of the corporation law relating to criminal liability of shareholders and officers. On the contrary, it is believed that the whole of the previous discussion in this article shows clearly that the corporate entity theory when used by judges and text writers, whether or not they admit it to be a fiction, has resulted in nothing but confusion of thought, so far as corporate criminal liability is concerned. And the further result has been that the theory has in a considerable measure made it impossible for the courts to see their way clear to enforcing criminal liability against mem- bers of a corporation to a degree proportionate to that with which such liability has long been enforced against unassociated individuals or parties to principal and agent, principal and accessory, master and ser- vant, or similar relationships. Certainly, all that seems necessary to a solution is a realization that the problem usually amounts to nothing other than the desirability of and the limits to the imposition of vicari- ous criminal liability in addition to or to the exclusion of holding crim- inally liable the persons actually committing the acts and participants therein. Then the usefulness of such anthropomorphic considerations as the evil intent of an entity's mind and the ability of the entity to con- spire or to commit various acts from river pollution to adultery van- ishes. One of the principal functions of a court or legislature is that of a nomenclator,-to assign to a particular act or status that recognized jural term which will designate and thus enable the jural consequences to follow which the court or legislature deems best as it views the inter- ests of society; and more particularly when necessary to apply accus- tomed jural terms to novel situations. It is in this quiet fashion that 1 HENDERSON, THE POSITION OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS IN AMERICAN CON- STITUTIONAL LAW (1918), 167-8. 199</page><page sequence="20">COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW the law grows without attracting the demagogic opposition of the chronic conservative. Consequently we have the phenomena of the same group having a number of different terms applied to it in order that the members may possess the cumulative jural advantages and dis- advantages of each. For instance, the inhabitants of a given area may be not only a municipal corporation, but a park district, a sanitary dis- trict, and a school district, all in order to exceed the constitutional debt limits of municipalities.162 Another example is the large recent growth of the law of public nuisance which has been due to statutory declara- tions of nuisance making applicable the law of nuisance to new situa- tions.l63 The lawyer engaged in framing legislation is familiar with the nomological value of such expressions as "is declared to be," "is deemed to be," "is created," or "shall constitute." These are the expressions which introduce to new situations those recognized jural terms which hold in their train the novel law which it has become necessary to apply to such situations. By such means as these do the puritanical followers of bare logic actually avoid the practice of their creed and yet save their faces when confronted with practical circumstances. The change in the application of the terms of jural theology makes unnecessary the confession of a change of personal belief. The same phrases are ad- hered to, though their application, their content, is so altered that their original substance has disappeared. Consequently we find actus non facit reum nisi mens rea given lip service to cloak the fact of its utter repugnance and non-applicability to the result achieved. And conse- quently we also find that actually all that the application of the term "corporation" to an association serves, is to show that the law has at- tached to that association of human beings a particular group of jural relationships, and not that, unless it be in its own mind, has either court or legislature created a superpersonality, or admitting the concept of an entity to be a legal fiction, need so consider its action for the pur- pose of a satisfactory determination of those jural relationships.'64 FREDERIC P.
