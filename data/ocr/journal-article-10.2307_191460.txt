<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCRIPTURE AND POLITICS I. PHILOSOPHY AND PROPHECY Spinoza's Hermeneutics NORMAN . BROWN [t I] University of California, Santa Cruz HE PHILOSOPHER WHO in the Ethics celebrates the pure life of theoretical contemplation in the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (like Plato's philosopher coming back down into the cave) faces the complex and muddy problems involved in the relation between philosophy and the nonphilosophic real world. Philosophy has to come to terms with two predominant nonphilosophical institutions: political power and positive religion. In the "Preface" Spinoza reviews the tendency for religion to degenerate into superstition and political power to degenerate into tyranny; superstition and tyranny threaten the very existence of philosophic freedom. The Tractatus is not an exercise in pure cognition but a model of practical reason in action, or even a political act: "I have not written with a view to introducing (intellectual) novelties, but in order to correct abuses."' The political act undertaken in the Tractacus is mediation-to regulate the relations between positive religion, political power, and philosophic freedom: to lay the basis for their peaceful coexistence. The aim is not another broadside in the old war between reason and revelation (or even freedom and tyranny), but peace. "Reason, though Hobbes thinks otherwise, is always on the side of peace."2 In order to function as peacemaker, philosophy can no longer function simply as philosophy. The Tractatus is not a pure product of philosophic thought but a hybrid: moving in the terrain in between philosophy, political power, and positive religion; mediating between these institutions, in order to make peace.

Spinoza already exists in the modern world: There is the distinct language of political power, articulated by Machiavelli and Hobbes; there is the Scriptural language of traditional religion; and there is the new language of philosophy, Descartes and Spinoza. These several languages need to be interpreted each to the other. In the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus the philosopher comes forward to play the role of interpreter. In order to become practically and politically effective, to advance the cause of peace and freedom in the real world, philosophy transforms itself into hermeneutics. Although Spinoza says his aim is not to introduce intellectual novelties but to correct abuses, there is one decisive intellectual novelty in the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus: "I determined to examine the Bible afresh in a careful, impartial, and free spirit, making no assumptions concerning it, and attributing to it no doctrines, which I did not find most clearly therein set down. With these pre- cautions I constructed a method of Scriptural interpretation."3 By what authority does Spinoza introduce a new method of Scriptural interpretation? By the power that inspired the Cartesian revolution, the free spirit taking a fresh look and subjecting everything to skeptical examination: in a word, the power of reason. Into the strife of contending principles of authority a new voice is injected which acknowledges no authority. After the Cartesian revolution, as developed in Spinoza's Ethics, to be rational means to be free; to know one's own mind; to depend on no external authority for knowledge of God or knowledge of right and wrong. The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, as a rational or scientific investigation of the nature of authority, has to be the rational investigation of the principle of irrationality in human affairs. It is reason examining its own opposite, faith; it is philosophy confronting its own opposite, prophecy, and recognizing in prophecy the fundamental form of the principle of authority in human affairs. "I constructed a method of Scriptural interpretation and thus equipped proceeded first of all to ask-What is prophecy? A prophet is one who interprets the revelations of God to those who are unable to attain sure knowledge of the things revealed by God, and therefore can only apprehend them by simple faith ... and whose belief relies only on the prophet's authority and their faith in him."4 Philosophy has to transform itself into Scriptural hermeneutics in order to investigate the nature of authority; that is to say, the scientific investigation of the nature of authority takes the form of an interpreta- tion of history. Strictly speaking, philosophy has direct knowledge of</page><page sequence="3">Brown / PHILOSOPHY AND PROPHECY 197 God and his eternal laws and has no need of Scripture. But in order to challenge traditional authority philosophy has to become an interpreta- tion of tradition. Being in itself a fresh start with the slate wiped clean, philosophy must examine the way the slate is actually inscribed with the legacy of the past. Philosophical hermeneutics is historical hermeneutics. The legacy of the past is a history of prophecy. Prophecy transmits itself from generation to generation in the form of historical narratives (Spinoza's word is histories); Spinoza defines his own task as "synthe- sizing the history of prophecy" (historiam prophetiae concinnare).5 Historical herineneutics is an exercise of natural reason, but it is natural reason recognizing the authority of the past and seeking to arrive at the essence of prophecy in its own terms: hence the basic rule that "our understanding of Scripture must be totally derived from Scripture only. ,6 Natural reason so operating on Scripture can produce (not philos- ophy but) only an interpretation. But interpretation is per se prophecy- a prophet is "one who interprets the revelations of God to those who are unable to attain sure knowledge by themselves." Scriptural hermeneutics is a hybrid form, or mask, that enables philosophy to enter the political arena disguised as the modern form of prophecy, the form of prophecy in an age in which there are no longer any living prophets. In form and texture the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus is not philosophy but prophecy, not theoretical science but practical wisdom, affording (as Spinoza says) not mathematical but only moral certainty.8 It is an exercise in persuasion, involving Spinoza's creative imagination and operating on productions of the human imagination-the original legacy of prophecy and the subsequent contending interpretations. Historical hemeneutics is philosophic enlightenment coming to understand itself as emancipation from the authority of the past, and therefore understanding itself as historically emergent. Spinoza's histor- ical method is therefore genealogical. Prophecy is the archetype or origin from which the three contending institutions in the modern world-political power, positive religion, and philosophic freedom- are all derived, the common notion in terms of which they can arrive at mutual understanding. History is the history of man's release from self-incurred tutelage-Kant's definition of enlightenment. Kant's defi- nition of tutelage-"man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another"-exactly corresponds to Spinoza's definition of prophecy: A prophet is a tutor for those who are unable to attain cognitive autonomy and must therefore rely on external authority.</page><page sequence="4">198 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1986 The evolution of humanity inevitably begins with prophecy, even as tutelage is inevitable for children. Historical hermeneutics teaches us not to look for pure doctrines of philosophic wisdom in the Mosaic dispensation, but elementary social discipline appropriate (Spinoza's term is accommodated) to a rude and uncivilized state: In truth, it is hardly likely that men accustomed to the superstitions of Egypt, uncultivated and sunk in most abject slavery, should have held any sound notions about the Deity, or that Moses should have taught them anything beyond a rule of right living; inculcating it not like a philosopher, as the result of freedom, but like a lawgiver compelling them to be moral by legal authority. Thus the rule of right living, the worship and love of God, was to them rather a bondage than the true liberty, the gift and grace of the Deity. Moses bid them love God and keep His law, because they had in the past received benefits from Him (such as the deliverance from slavery in Egypt), and further terrified them with threats if they transgressed His commands, holding out many promises of good if they should observe them; thus treating them as parents treat irrational children.9 History, which is the history of prophecy, goes from Moses in the wilderness to the great modern city of Amsterdam, which "reaps the fruit of freedom in its own great prosperity."l0 At the other end of history is civilized toleration, in which "we have the rare happiness of living in a republic, where eveyone's judgment is free and unshackled, where each may worship God as his conscience dictates, and where freedom is esteemed before all things dear and precious. "II Philosophic freedom emerges as humanity outgrows the need for authority; philosophy itself is a new and more enlightened chapter in the history of prophecy. Spinoza's historical perspective contradicts the usual view of philosophy as a legacy of Greek rationality distinct from and opposed to the Hebraic legacy of prophecy. Spinoza contemp- tuously dismisses the speculations of Platonists and Aristotelians. Philosophy is defined as knowledge of God and his eternal laws revealed by the natural light of reason common to all: Philosophy is equated with natural religion. And natural religion emerged from the mutation in the prophetic tradition that is recorded in the transition from the Old Testament to the New. The archetypal philosopher is not Socrates but Jesus Christ. The historical mutation in the prophetic tradition is crystallized in the antithesis between Moses and Christ. The prophets who preached religion before Christ preached it as a national law in virtue of the covenant entered into in the time of Moses, whereas the Apostles preached it as the universal or catholic religion for all.'2</page><page sequence="5">Brown / PHILOSOPHY AND PROPHECY 199 Mosaic prophecy includes the foundation of a particular state and positive laws to sustain it; its method is constraint rather than instruction, and it promises temporal prosperity. Christ's mission was to teach universal moral precepts, and for this reason he promises a spiritual rather than a temporal reward.'3 Christ reduced the prophetic religion to its essence, and in formulating the Golden Rule-to love God above all things and one's neighbor as oneself-transcended the prophetic principle of obedience to the law and prefigured the philo- sophic religion of love.'4 In line with the fundamental distinction he draws between (philosophic) mind and (prophetic) imagination, Spinoza goes out of his way to differentiate Christ from Moses in epistemological terms. Christ was unique in the prophetic tradition in communicating with God without the intervention of imaginary appearances such as Moses' voice, but directly mind to mind, with clear and distinct ideas, so that Christ was not so much a prophet as the mouth of God; that is, in Christ the wisdom of God took upon itself human nature." The mutation represented by Christ is the nodal point in a long-range tendency in the historical process (the prophetic tradition) in the direction of rationality. The universal religion, which we now can apprehend as a precept of reason in philosophic form, had first to be introduced in the form of prophetic revelation.'6 After Christ the Apostolic epistles, especially Paul's, represent a further advance over the Gospels in the direction of rational form: didactic and argumentative rather than prophetic (or fabulous) narrative. "Paul teaches exactly the same as ourselves."'7 Old Testament prophecy, notably Isaiah, shows a long-range tendency to transform prophetic revelation into universal and catholic religion for the entire human race; to discard ceremonial laws in favor of a simple rule of charity and the upright heart; and, above all, to supersede the external covenant of God, written in ink or on tables of stone, with the true original covenant inscribed by the Spirit on the human heart, on the fleshy tables of the heart (II Corinthians, 111:3); stamped with his own seal, that is, the idea of God himself in the image of his Godhead.'8 Spinoza interprets "the Word of God written in our hearts" as the equivalent, in Biblical language, of what philosophy formulates as the natural light of reason that is common to all. Thus rationality was at work even though it was not understood as such (i.e., philosophically). The paradoxical situation is expounded by Spinoza in Biblical language: "It was in the world," as John the Evangelist says, "and the world knew it not."'9</page><page sequence="6">200 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1986 Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus takes up where his Ethics left off. If philosophy is going to contribute to the improvement of the human condition (Spinoza's program in the treatise On the Improve- ment of the Understanding), it must find a basis for mediating between the antinomies left static and absolute in the Ethics: the antinomies between reason and imagination, freedom and bondage, theory and practice. Translated into the world of political realities, these philo- sophical antinomies become the polarity between prophecy and philos- ophy, between (political and religious) authority and philosophic freedom. There is a need for mediation not only between philosophy and the real world outside but also inside the philosophic system itself. A static and absolute antinomy between reason and imagination is inconsistent with the epistemological premise of theEthics, the coherence of truth, and the overriding metaphysical principle of unity: Truth is a unity; the function of reason is to make it all cohere. "Reason (though Hobbes thinks otherwise) is always on the side of peace":20 Philosophy, to vindicate itself, must establish peace between reason and revelation. Already in his early Metaphysical Meditations Spinoza asserted that Sacred Scripture teaches the same doctrines as natural reason, for "truth cannot be at war with truth" (veritas veritati non repugnat).2' The historical hermeneutics developed in the Tractatus is the middle term the whole system cries out for. It is an essential corollary of the principle of coherence, and the whole system of the Ethics, to discriminate different degrees or levels of truth, power, and perfection. All our practical problems arise from the fact that all humans are not perfectly rational. But all are endowed with the natural light of reason; both the human individual and the human collectivity must be seen as in transition from a lesser to a greater degree of what Spinoza calls perfection. Morality, ethics, our whole duty individually and collectively lies in the improvement of the human mind: All our actions and thoughts must be directed to one end; namely, to attain the greatest possible human perfection.22 From the doctrine of degrees or levels of truth and perfection it also follows that error can never be absolute, but must always be a matter of having relatively incomplete (inadequate) knowledge. Mediation between reason and imagination cannot take place if the polarity remains static; it is set in motion by a dynamic nisus toward perfection. Philosophy needs the plane of history in order to unfold as enlightenment: Then prophecy can be seen praeparatio philosophandi, preparing the way for philosophy. The power that sets in motion the civilizational process, the</page><page sequence="7">Brown / PHILOSOPHY AND PROPHECY 201 progress toward perfection, is not philosophy but prophecy, not reason but imagination. "Prophets were not endowed with more perfect minds, but rather with the power of a more vivid imagination."23 In the Ethics Spinoza spoke only of the limitations of the imagination as compared with the clear and distinct ideas of pure geometric reasoning; in the Tractatus we see the positive and creative power of the imagination. Prophecy is imagination in action: It produces the first form of human society, and the first form of the knowledge of God. With it humankind emerges from the state of nature into the state of religion and law. Prophecy is perfected as it becomes more rational and moves toward a conjunction with philosophy, with Jesus Christ as the turning point. The end of the process is historical hermeneutics, which is the perfection of both prophecy and philosophy. To perfect prophecy in hermeneutics, philosophy has to transform itself from the pure pursuit of knowledge for its own sake into something practically and politically effective in the real world. In Spinoza's Ethics power and perfection are equated and "The more perfection a thing possesses, the more it acts and the less it suffers; the more it acts the more perfect it is."24 Philosophy cannot rest impotent in the divorce of theory from practice. The philosopher is not and cannot become king, but he can inherit the prophetic function of speaking truth to kings, and raise his voice on behalf of peace. There is an instructive analogy in Islamic philosophy, coming to terms with the prophet Muhammad. According to Alfarabi, philosophy is prior to religion, and religion is an "imitation" of philosophy. Religion is an imitation of philosophy inasmuch as while both give an account of the ultimate principles of Being, religion supplies an imaginative account of things whereof philosophy possesses direct and demonstra- tive knowledge. Nevertheless, a purely theoretical perfection is an incomplete perfection: The perfect philosopher is also the supreme ruler and lawgiver; he must have the capacity to teach the community and to form character so that everyone is enabled to achieve the perfection of which he is capable. For this purpose the philosopher will need religion, defined as the assent, secured by persuasion rather than demonstration, to an imaginative account of reality appropriate, accommodated, to the nonphilosophic multitude. Thus the perfect human is both philosopher and prophet, combining theoretical knowledge with mastery of the arts of rhetoric and poetry. Muhammad is an actual embodiment of that excellence given literary portrayal in the writings of Plato.25 Mediation between prophecy and philosophy is the central problem in Islamic philosophy. Spinoza inherits this tradition via Maimonides.</page><page sequence="8">202 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1986 In order to become practical, philosophy has to become hermeneutics, master the problem of language-the refraction of the light of the One into the diversity of tongues, times, and places. The term the Tractatus uses to articulate the problem is accommodation. Historical herme- neutics shows how religion is always accommodated to the intellectual level and imaginative complexion of both the prophets and the people in different historical circumstances, "accommodated to the prejudices of each age."26 Hermeneutics gives us a pragmatic understanding of the limits of the possible, and thus equips us for historical action. It also gives us psychological understanding of the variety of human opinion, and thus lays the basis for toleration. Spinoza's first programmatic manifesto, On the Improvement of the Understanding, had laid down as the first rule to guide the practical life of the philosopher to accommodate his language to the capacity of the vulgar, or, as we might say, to ordinary language.27 The passage is misinterpreted and mistranslated in the current English translation, "to speak in a manner intelligible to the multitude. " The Latin is ad captum vulgi loqui; comparison with the Tractatus shows that this is a short- hand phrase to refer to the principle of accommodation.28 The programmatic treatise On the Improvement of the Understanding presents philosophy as first of all a private and personal pursuit of self-perfection, which then joins "together with other individuals if possible, insofar as it is necessary to form a social order conducive to the attainment of self-perfection by the greatest possible number." 29 It is as if there was a primary philosophic activity of self-perfection that could be pursued in solitary self-sufficiency, and the problem of the relation of philosophy to ordinary language only arose when the philosopher reached out to collaborate with other individuals, "if possible," in the practical task of improving society. The underlying epistemological assumption is the Spinozistic separation of reason from imagination: the art (or science) of language relegated to the sphere of the imagination; the connection between the two is "accommodation." It is only in the Tractatus that Spinoza deals directly with what is meant by accommodation. Thus the Tractatus (as hermeneutics) is the key to Spinoza's use of language, even in the Ethics.</page><page sequence="9">Brown / PHILOSOPHY AND PROPHECY 203 Accommodation is precisely what distinguishes prophecy from philosophy. "Scripture does not teach philosophy but only piety, and all that it contains has been accommodated to the capacity and pre- conceived opinions of the vulgar. "30 The maxim or rule ad captum vulgi loqui that Spinoza imposes on himself is derived not from the nature of philosophy but from the prophetic tradition, and it assimilates Spinoza's public utterances to prophetic speech. Spinoza wants to keep the theoretical distinction between two spheres-reason and imagination, philosophy and theology: "The sphere of reason is, as we have said, truth and wisdom: the sphere of theology is piety and obedience."'" But the real world of practical politics belongs ultimately to theology. The social order depends on obedience, but the power of reason does not extend so far as to establish the principle of obedience. Therefore, revelation was necessary; and revelation is essentially a combination of reason and imagination (i.e., essentially involves accommodation). Hence on one hand Scripture must not be accommodated to reason, nor reason to the Scripture; on the other hand Scriptural hermeneutics, which is the way the prophetic tradition stays alive in a postprophetic age, is both the study of accommodation as exemplified in the Biblical record and itself an exercise in accommodation. The principle of accommodation enables us to understand the refraction of the One into the variety of human imagination, and thus establishes the difference between the dogmatic uniformity and plural- istic concord (toleration). The more flexible and pragmatic under- standing of the nature of religion ("true religion') introduced by historical hermeneutics reduces religion to its essence, the fundamental dogmas of religion universal and catholic to the whole human race. On the other hand, these bare bones must be fleshed out by the obligatory practice of accommodation: Every man is bound to accommodate these dogmas to his own way of thinking, and to interpret them according as he feels that he can give them his fullest and most unhesitating assent, so that he may the more easily obey God with his whole heart. Such was the manner, as we have already pointed out, in which the faith was in old time revealed and written, in accordance with the understanding and opinions of the prophets and people of the period; so, in like fashion, every man is bound to accommodate it to his own opinions, so that he may accept it without any hesitation or mental repugnance.32 Accommodation necessarily involves a sacrifice of the Cartesian ideal of clear and distinct ideas. Clear and distinct ideas make clear</page><page sequence="10">204 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1986 distinctions: They will never teach us, as Spinoza does in the Tractatus, that "it makes no difference whether religion be apprehended by our natural faculties or by revelation ... religion is one and the same and is equally revealed by God whatever be the manner in which it becomes known to men.""3 Accommodation needs ambiguity, equivocation ("to express oneself in terms that admit of different interpretations"), prevarication (the basic metaphor is from straddling, with one's legs apart). The equivocation or prevarication in the Tractatus enables us to recognize the supreme equivocation in the Ethics-Deus sive Natura. In his initial and basic terminological arrangements Spinoza allows prophecy and philosophy to share the idea of God. Prophecy, or revelation, is "certain knowledge revealed by God to man"; natural knowledge, knowledge revealed by the natural light of reason, is also prophecy, as it "depends entirely on knowledge of God and his eternal decrees."34 If prophecy (as seen by philosophy) were dismissed as merely erroneous or as mere superstition, or if philosophy (as seen by theology) turned out to be atheist, then the whole project of mediation would collapse. Hence, religion has to be one and the same, and "equally revealed by God, whatever be the manner in which it becomes known to men." Similar equivocation or prevarication occurs with "divine law." Spinoza first identifies divine law with laws derived from (philosophic) true knowledge and love of God. The rest are human laws, which have a different aim, "unless they have been sanctioned by revelation," "for from this point of view also things are referred to God"; so that the law of Moses, "although not universal and very largely accommodated to the particular preservation of a single people, may nevertheless be called law of God or divine law inasmuch as we believe it to have been sanctioned by the light of prophecy."35 These are not clear and distinct ideas. In formulating the "universal religion," the fundamental dogmas of the whole of Scripture, language is strained to accommodate (i.e., reduce) the gap between the prophetic religion of obedience, rewards, and punishments and the philosophic religion of love; to effect a compromise.36 Strictly speaking, some evasion is involved, some masking (larvatus prodeo), some disguise. The philosopher is not speaking with his own voice, but instead "adopting the language of John"; or "I affirm with Paul."37 Spinoza achieves unspoken (persuasive) effects by manipulating discourses that are not his own; for example, juxtaposing his version of the social contract theory of origins (chap. XVI) with the Biblical</page><page sequence="11">Brown / PHILOSOPHY AND PROPHECY 205 account of the Mosaic Covenant (chap. XVII), letting the analogy speak for itself. Accommodation, in Spinoza's philosophy, is not prudent dissimula- tion, as Leo Strauss takes it, but an active effort to promote tolerant concord-in a word, charity. Toleration is not a maxim of mutual indifference laid down by raison d'etat (Hobbes and Locke), a negative limit to a rational requirement of conformity: It is mutual understanding based on recognition of the variety of the human imagination; that is, charity made scientific by the new science of hermeneutics. Without equivocation, no toleration. Accommodation without equivocation is the hegemonic assertion of uniformity or conformity, the one-sided domination of philosophy over theology or theology over philosophy. Toleration is based not on rational uniformity but on sentimental concord, located in the heart, the heart that has its reasons that reason does not know. Accommodation is equivocation. Equivocation is justified by faith- the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things unseen-faith in the existence of a hidden or preestablished harmony; a hidden harmony transcending verbal disagreement; a hidden harmony, in spite of the contradictory facts of linguistic variety, sectarian discord, the Tower of Babel. It is the faith that in spite of the contradictory facts, the patent contradiction between the philosophic few and the superstitious multitude, nevertheless there is, hidden in the human breast, the natural light of reason common to all human beings as such. "It is no accident," says Spinoza, that "the word of God in the prophets is in entire agreement with the very word of God which speaks inside of us" (as prefigured in Christ, who was not so much a prophet as the mouth of God, in whom the wisdom of God manifested itself in human form.)38 It is the prophetic faith, invoked five times in the Tractatus, that religion, first imparted to the human race in the form of an external code of law written down, is now inscribed in God's own handwriting, in the form of the idea of himself and the very image of his Godhead, on the fleshy tables of the human heart.39 It is no accident that this, the central proposition in the Tractatus, relies on prophetic rhetoric for its persuasive force: Spinoza cites Deuteronomy (XXX:6), Jeremiah (XXXI:33), and 2 Corinthians (111:3). And what it asserts is equivalence or equivocation between the voice of reason and the voice of imagination.</page><page sequence="12">206 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1986 Philosophy transforms the prophetic faith in hidden harmony into philosophic knowledge (of the Unity: that it all coheres), and transforms the prophetic ethic of charity into the intellectual love of God. Divine laws appear to us as laws or positive commandments only so long as we are ignorant of their cause; as soon as their cause is known they cease to be laws and we embrace them not as laws but as eternal truths; that is to say obedience passes over into love, which emanates from true knowledge as necessarily as light emanates from the sun.40 The intellectual love of God transforms, perfects, and finally transcends the prophetic religion. Obedientia in amorem transit: Obedience passes over into love. There is a dialectical mutation, prefigured in the dialectical mutation from the Old to the New Testament. Like Jesus, philosophy can say, "I came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill." It is-using the Tractatus to illuminate the controversial mysteries of the Ethics-a mystic transcendence. To pass over beyond prophecy is to pass over beyond words and images: "Inasmuch as God revealed Himself to Christ, or to Christ's mind, immediately, and not as to the prophets through words and images, we must suppose that Christ truly perceived or understood what was revealed; for a thing is understood when it is perceived purely by the mind beyond words and images. "41 It is only at this point-when we pass beyond words and images-that we can discard equivocation. The intellectual effort in the Tractatus is to transcend the dualisms from which it begins. "Although natural knowledge is divine, its propagators cannot be called prophets": [A prophet] interprets [i.e., mediates] the decrees of God revealed to him to others who have received no revelation, and whose belief therefore relies merely on the authority of the prophet and faith reposed in him. If it were otherwise, and all who listen to prophets became prophets themselves, as all who listen to philosophers become philosophers, a prophet would no longer be the interpreter of the divine decrees, inasmuch as the listeners would no longer rely on the prophet's testimony and authority but on actual revelation and inward testimony.42 Philosophy is here presented as a dialectical transcendence of prophecy, both perfecting it and superceding it. Prophecy would be perfected if all became prophets; but at this point quantity passes over into quality: Reliance on external authority falls away; the inner light that had</page><page sequence="13">Brown / PHILOSOPHY AND PROPHECY 207 privileged the prophet passes over into the natural light common to all; we are in the realm of freedom and philosophy. Prophetic theology passes over into philosophical theology. On the political side the point at which dualism is transcended is democracy. Spinoza says his chief purpose in the Treatise is to exhibit the fundamental principles of democracy as being the most natural form of rule and the most consistent with individual liberty.43 The argument takes the form of expounding an (equivocal) concordance between social contract theory (chap. XVI) and the scriptural history of the Mosaic covenant (chapter XVII). In the language of social contract theory, as against Hobbes, Spinoza insists on the theoretical possibility of democracy: A society can be formed without any contradiction of natural rights, and the compact can be entirely and eternally kept with the utmost fidelity, if each individual hands over all the power he has to society; society will then have sole possession of natural rights over all things; that is, it will have supreme sovereignty, and everyone will be bound to obey, either as a free choice or by fear of punishment. Such a constitution of society is called a democracy, which accordingly is defined as a collective body which collegially exercises unlimited sovereign rights." Democracy is the natural outcome of a rational understanding of the social contract on which society is based: Another passage says that in a democracy all agree with common consent to live according to the dictates of reason.45 But at the same time Spinoza insists on the religious dimension of the social contract. Obedience is not a rational but a theological principle, and therefore society has to begin with prophetic revelation.46 Society is brought into existence not by rational fear and the rational instinct of self-preservation, as in Hobbes, but by the prophetic indoctrination with the idea of God: Moses introduced a religion so that the people might do their duty willingly, with fidelity and constancy, from devotion, and not from fear.47 The social contract was essentially a covenant, including an oath, whereby humans agreed to obey God in all things, as it were surrendering their natural liberty and transferring their rights to God.48 Political organization is instrinsically theocratic. It is intrinsically theocratic, but there are degrees of perfection and truth to be distinguished. In the childhood of the human race, given the fickle and irrational disposition of the multitude, the regime of authority and obedience that makes possible the transition from barbarism to civilization reflects fictions and distortions that are necessary con-</page><page sequence="14">208 POLITICAL THEORY / May 1986 cessions to the demands of the human imagination. The institution of divine kingship depends on "the belief that kingship is sacred and plays the part of God on earth, that it has been instituted by God not by the suffrage and consent of men."49 Spinoza cites instances from pagan history, such as Alexander and Augustus, and then like Machiavelli lets us infer that Moses was not so different: "Moses, not by fraud, but by divine virtue, gained such a hold on the popular judgement that he was thought to be divine, and divinely inspired in all his words and actions."50 In the institution of divine kingship the interpreter of God (i.e., the prophet) takes the place of God. In his initial and basic definition of prophet as interpreter of God, Spinoza cites Exodus (VI: 1), in which God says to Moses, "See I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet"; glossing the text he says, "since in interpreting Moses' words to Pharaoh Aaron acted the part of a prophet, Moses would be to Pharaoh quasi Deus, as it were God; or as acting in the place of God, vicem Dei agit. " 5l Spinoza has incorporated into the Tractatus the doctrine of Hobbes in Part III of the Leviathan: The Kingdom of God is a real, not a metaphorical Kingdom; the Kingdom of God is a Civil Commonwealth, in which God himself is Sovereign, wherein he reigneth by his Vicar, Vicegerent, Lieutenant, Sovereign Prophet, or Representative. Exactly so Spinoza reiterates that those who actually exercise sovereign power (imperium) are the interpreters and therefore masters of all law, both civil and religious; religion acquires the force of law only from the command of sovereign rulers; God has no special kingdom among men except through those who actually exercise sovereign power.52 The construction of civil society according to the pattern of the human imagination not only requires an idolatrous usurpation of divine status by human kings, but also the anthropomorphic representation of God as sovereign potentate, king, legislator, in direct violation of Spinoza's warning in the Ethics that it is essential to avoid any confusion between the power of God and the human power and rights of kings.53 The history of the Hebrew Republic shows us a better way, a better form of theocracy. That government is best, the most natural, in which dependence on prophetic authority is transcended by all together being their own prophets, as is the case in the theoretical ideal of democracy. Spinoza cites, as Milton did before him and Blake did after him, Moses' own exclamation, Numbers (XI:29), "Would to God that all the Lord's people were prophets," and comments, "that is, would to God that the right of consulting God resulted in power being in the hands of the</page><page sequence="15">Brown / PHILOSOPHY AND PROPHECY 209 people."54 Democracy is the most perfect form of theocracy, the only true theocracy: All the Lord's people being their own prophets would mean transcending the idolatrous worship of God's earthly Vicegerent and discovering the one and only true God, the very image of his Godhead inscribed in the fleshy tables of the human heart, which is the natural light of reason common to all human beings, by virtue of which all are equal. Spinoza fleshes out this theoretical possibility with his own (prophetic) interpretation of the events on Sinai (Exodus XX; Deuteronomy V). The original contract was between God and all the people together, "as in a democracy," but the experience of God speaking out of the fire was so terrifying that the people asked Moses to be the mediator, interpreter, or prophet, saying, "Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say, and speak then unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it and do it" (Deut. V:27).55 "God alone held sovereignty over the Hebrews; by virtue of the covenant or compact their state was called God's kingdom.... There was no distinction between civil and religious law; inasmuch as the citizens were bound only by law directly revealed by God, the state could be called a theocracy."56 Although all states, by virtue of the fundamental nature of the social contract, are theocratic, the Hebrew Republic is theocratic par excel- lence, representing the perfection of the theocratic principle; and it is theocratic par excellence by being democratic. In Spinoza's interpreta- tion of Hebrew history the theocracy comes to an end with the institution of kingship, when the people break with God's rule ("divine right") and ask for a king like the Gentiles have (I Samuel VIII).57 In Spinoza's extraordinary and still unsurpassed interpretation of Hebrew history, the change over to kingship is the final fall, but there was a fatal seed of corruption in the Mosaic constitution: the separate Levitic priesthood instead of the universal priesthood of the first-born in every family, as originally intended by God until the people's defection to the Golden Calf.58 That God should have ordered the introduction of a fatal flaw marring his own revelation of the perfect theocratic constitution draws from Spinoza a daring recall of Tacitus' epigram: God's concern at that time was not human well-being but punishment. The effect of this Machiavellian use of Tacitean irony is to liberate the theological imagination from bondage to the letter. To find the perfect theocratic constitution we have to go back to God's "original intention": "If the state had been formed according to the original intention, the rights and</page><page sequence="16">210 POLITICAL TH:EORY / May 1986 honour of all the tribes would have been equal, and everything would have rested on a firm basis."59 The theopolitical premise of perfect democratic or republican equality is the priesthood of all believers, or at least of every paterfamilias. But for this flaw (the separate Levitic priesthood) the Hebrew republic might have been immortal, eternal (aeternum).60 An "immortal commonwealth," a republic made exempt from the cycle of degeneration by mixing and balancing, as in Polybius' theory, monarchical aristo- cratic and democratic elements. The Tractatus, as a venture in mediation, in hybrid or mixed or "impure" thought, reaches here its most advanced point. Spinoza is effecting a conjunction between prophetic history and the most advanced speculations of contemporary republicanism, based on classical political theory as modernized by Machiavelli.61 Chapter XVII of the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus shows that a model of republican stability, such as James Harrington had projected in his utopian scheme Oceana (1656), is enshrined in the early Hebrew Commonwealth, which (Spinoza says), although "it would be impossible to imitate today," nevertheless "possessed many excellent features which should be brought to our attention and perhaps imitated with advantage."62 Spinoza's analysis conforms to Harringtonian principles. Moses, who himself exercised sovereign power, did not establish a successor with sovereign power, but distributed his prerogatives and divided his powers, separating the high priesthood and the interpretation of the laws (Aaron) from the executive power and military command (Joshua), and even distributing the military command according to a federal (tribal) principle, as in the United States of the Netherlands. As in Harrington, the checks and balances which, Spinoza says, "so effectively kept within bounds both rulers and ruled" are sustained by a patriotic civic consciousness based on freehold tenure of equal lots of land, universal possession of arms, and systematic instruction in the holy book of law. The result is an armed popular commonwealth, in Spinoza's words, the rule of the people, regnum populi, defended by the ardent patriotism of free citizen-soldiers. The civic consciousness that animates the whole is saturated with religion; the checks and balances that cancel out the predominance of human agencies leave God as the center of political life. After the death of Moses no one man wielded all the power of a sovereign; as affairs were not at all managed by one man, nor by a single council, nor by the popular</page><page sequence="17">Brown / PHILOSOPHY AND PROPHECY 211 vote, but partly by one tribe, partly by the rest in equal shares, it is most evident that the government, after the death of Moses, was neither monarchic, nor aristocratic, nor popular, but as we have said, Theocratic. The reasons for applying this term are: I. Because the royal seat of government was the Temple, and in respect to it alone, as we have shown, all the tribes were fellow-citizens. II. Because all the people owed allegiance to God, their supreme Judge, to whom only they had promised implicit obedience in all things. III. Because the general-in-chief or 63 dictator, when there was need of such, was elected by none save God alone. Even so Harrington-like Spinoza, a strong defender of religious freedom and enemy of priestly power-maintained that the Mosaic commonwealth had been a true classical republic; that Oceana, the restored republic, is both a new Israel and a new Rome; and that a republic is a theocracy. Harrington reaches for the same point of transcendence at which reason and revelation coincide: "A common- wealth is a monarchy: to her God is king, in as much as reason, his dictat, is her sovereign power."64 NOTES 1.
