Caporael Department of Science and Technology Studies Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute When sociobiology burst on the scene, it trumpeted neo-Darwinism as a revolu- tionary new paradigm for psychology, the humanities and the social sciences (Wil- son, 1975). If theories were judged by their success in the competition of ideas, sociobiology would be a distant runner-up to another interdisciplinary innovation of the 1970s-feminist theory, which spawned hundreds of women's studies pro- grams, altered government policy, and bred a generation of women athletes who broke records most men said women were biologically incapable of breaking. In contrast, sociobiology sputters along, propelled by popular interest (e.g., "Is adul- tery in our genes?" asks the cover of a weekly news magazine) and the vague sense among a growing number of scholars that evolutionary theory should or could in- form our understanding of mind and behavior. Why has sociobiology failed to have the impact of feminism?

These criticisms are puny when compared to the criticisms lodged against feminism and "women's libbers." The problem for sociobiology runs deeper. Feminism made people see themselves and their world in a different light, and that changed them. Yet for all the claims that Darwinism is revolutionary or groundbreaking, it did not change the way we saw human nature. More often then not, it simply gave us more puffed-up ways to talk about girls who were gold diggers and boys sowing their wild oats. Darwin's critics are right: Evo- lutionary theory is mired in culture, but they are wrong if the critics think that suffi- cient reason to abandon Darwinism. There is great hope for a human evolutionary theory. It will mean, however, turning to postmodernism so that we can see Dar- winism as a synthesis, not just of natural selection and genetics, but also of biology and culture. It will mean a new kind of science, one that goes beyond what Francis Bacon had in mind. GENES AND ENGINEERING Darwin 's Dangerous Idea is an ambitious and provocative project: a celebration of the Darwinian revolution and a defense of our most cherished ideas and ideals. Dennett is perfectly willing to remove the genetic sticking point if that will make signing on for the Darwinian revolution easier. If we like, we may talk of virtual genes. (I would argue that this is what most sociobiological talk is anyway.) Ac- cording to Dennett, Darwin's idea is that the diversity of life on Earth could be ex- plained in terms of algorithms. An algorithm is "substrate neutral," meaning that its step-by-step procedures can be run on a computer, on paper with a pencil, or on bio- logical entities. It is also mindless and guaranteed in the sense that what it does, it al- ways does-assuming no errors in execution. Natural selection is just an algorith- mic process. If there is a population of items (e.g., genes, language, customs) that vary, that are heritable, and that differentially replicate, the result will be natural se- lection. Ceteris paribus, the next generation of items, will be more like the items that reproduced the most in the previous generation. Of course, the beauty of Dar- winism is in the details-the starting assumptions, the errors that do happen, and all the exceptions to ceteris paribus. Darwin's idea is dangerous because it threatens cherished ideas and ideals, having to do with God, free will, individual freedom, creative thought, moral judgment, and other ideas of the Enlightenment. God goes, but Dennett man- ages to save everything else with the help of memes (more about them later). The strongest feature of Dennett's book is the methodological material on evo- lutionary design (philosophers and biologists will doubtless find other strengths and weaknesses). Dennett advocates what he calls the design stance,</page><page sequence="3">BOOKS &amp; IDEAS 211 an engineering approach that assumes complex mechanisms are functional and can be described in terms of the achievements of ever smaller and stupider mechanisms. However, Dennett realizes that any function is ultimately a com- promise. Optimization may be a heuristic starting strategy for adaptationist thinking, but there is no guarantee that evolutionary design results in optimal design. Dennett recognizes conditions that could block optimization, describes historical accidents, and discusses nongenetic routes to optimal behavior. His topics include homologies, constraints, serendipitous side effects of design, en- abling or scaffolding design features, "forced moves," historical and develop- mental contingency, and the way functions can be lost and converted to new functions. One of the most important themes, stressed throughout, is that an entity and its specific environment--organism and setting, structure and context, DNA and DNA readers--evolve together. Co-occurrence is definitely not what most sociobiologists have in mind when they begin enumerating trait lists of human na- ture. Assertions that there are genes for sex differences in mathematical ability, rape, or altruism because these enhance reproductive fitness are made as shortcuts and substitutes for teasing out the intricate interactions among ecological facts, historical contingencies, and development. Evolutionary design qua design is in such details; otherwise the appeal to genes is merely unwarranted essentialism. Most of the nuts and bolts of design are concentrated in Dennett's chapters on re- verse engineering and adaptationist thinking as a heuristic strategy, but these are strong themes throughout the book. Dennett's exposition is one of the clearest and most accessible descriptions of the design stance. Less effective, and often disagreeable, is Dennett's invention of two meta- phoric devices, skyhooks and cranes. Skyhooks are "mind-first" explanations of design-they do not invoke mindless, mechanical processes for design. Cranes are algorithmic processes that speed up local adaptation and result from evolu- tionary design. In practice, the distinctions are not often so clear. First, they de- pend on starting assumptions and perspective, and second, their use gets muddied once they become social categories. Unlike sensible crane makers who see evolutionary design as the result of small steps in an algorithmic process, crazy skyhookers see everything else-from God to Stephen Jay Gould. Func- tionally, skyhooks and cranes become "us" versus "them" talk. The chapter cast- ing Gould as searching for God-like explanations for adaptation is odd since Gould's work contains many of the same reverse engineering concepts Dennett presents. A major difference between Gould and Dennett is the importance they ascribe to a gene's-eye view of evolution. Where Dennett writes that the gene's-eye view "explains things in terms of the intricate interactions between long-range, large-scale ecological facts, long-term historical facts, and local, molecular-level facts" (p. 326), Gould argues that not all evolutionary processes can be reduced to the gene's self-interest.</page><page sequence="4">212 CAPORAEL HARMONY IN THE UNIVERSE William Whewell, a 19th-century naturalist, coined the phrase "consilience of in- ductions." It was a methodological strategy where the facts from one domain neatly fit the facts in another like the corresponding pieces of a puzzle. Consilience was elaborated in this century as "strong inference" by the philosopher-physicist John Platt (1964). He stressed the search for disconfirmation and counterfactual thinking in consilient induction. In Consilience: The Unity ofKnowledge, Edward O. Wil- son has expanded consilience to argue for the fit among all knowledge domains: The central idea ofthe consilience world view is that all tangible phenomena, from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics. (p. 266) Wilson grounds his vision of unity in the Enlightenment, a period when new politi- cal forms, visions of human nature, and methods of inquiry were in creative fer- ment. However, according to Wilson (chapter 3), the Enlightenment vision had its shortcomings. The promised science was flawed: It rejected emotion in favor of pure reason, it could not provide a foundation for ethics, and it threatened human freedom with the quest for the perfect social order. With passion, elegance, and courage, Wilson takes his argument from physics through biology and psychology, through culture and the social sciences, and finally to art, ethics, and religion. In Wilson's view, the natural sciences have already achieved consilience, a fit between the domains of physics and chemistry, and most recently, biology. The challenge now is to make the other great branches of learning, the social sciences and humanities, consilient with the natural sciences. His prototypic example of a consilient explanation is familiar from earlier work: the snake dream, traced from "a magician's dream all the way down to an atom" (p. 71). Sheared of its drama, Wilson proposes that dreaming of snakes is a species-typical feature. Snakes were a dangerous threat to humans in the distant past, giving rise to an inborn aversion, which found its way into various cultural myths as a potent symbol. Dreams are explained by the activation-synthesis hypothesis. During sleep, internal activation of the brain stem causes the conscious brain to create images, and at waking, the brain attempts to put the images into a coherent narrative. Dreaming is controlled by the seesaw effects of two reciprocally acting neurotransmitters-the molecular basis, "down to the atom," of dreaming. Wilson's general strategy is to examine what prevents consilience at the bound- aries of disciplines and suggest how that consilience may be achieved. In one way or another, all his strategies revolve around biological and psychological solu- tions. Art interpretation can be enhanced by an alliance between art and science, the latter providing data about archetypes, supernormal stimuli, and physiological</page><page sequence="5">BOOKS &amp; IDEAS 213 effects of different styles and techniques of representation. The evolution of moral sentiments, and its converse, xenophobia, provides the foundation of religion and ethics. In the case of the social sciences, including economics, research in biology and psychology must replace the folk psychological assumptions made about hu- man choice and decisions. Although Wilson displays great erudition, the success of this strategy probably depends on readers' disciplines. For example, psychologists have repeatedly dem- onstrated that ingroup-outgroup attitudes and behavior are contingent on numer- ous factors. Wilson suggests a much cleaner and consistent boundary in his discussion of xenophobia than what actually exists. Although it is clear how Wil- son envisions science contributing to greater understanding in the humanities and arts, it is less clear how they in turn might change science. Wilson alludes to consilience: "Now, with science and the arts combined, we have it all" (p. 237), but he does not tell us what "it" is. Even more than Dennett, Wilson is engaged in try- ing to save Enlightenment values. For example, he applauds ethicists who study "evolved" moral sentiments and find themselves returning to the ideas developed in the 18th century by the likes of Adam Smith and Francis Bacon. However, is it not odd that Darwinism takes us back to pre-Darwinian views of human nature? THE HYBRID SCIENCE Darwinism is no longer as inflammatory as it was a decade or so ago, but it is still a good idea to draw lines in the sand and position oneself so that collateral damage can be contained. My scientific credentials are in human ethology and social psy- chology. Evolutionary theory has been either background or foreground in my work, although I reject genecentrism and nature-nurture dualism (Caporael, 1997), and consilience also has been my method of choice (e.g., Caporael, 1976). Consilience may be achieved experimentally or interpretively. It is related to her- meneutic methods and the multimethod triangulation of Campbell (1988). In con- trast to Wilson, I view consilience as a specific problem-oriented method in which the objective is a more perceptive look at an overall pattern of relationships rather than a unified world view and reduction to singular ultimate cause. Interestingly, one of my earliest failures with consilient methodology involved linking sociobiology and psychology. On the surface, it appeared that psychology had a wealth of research data, but was limited to "minitheories" explaining the findings. Sociobiology faced a differ- ent situation, a wealth of theory and a dearth of data on humans. In a consilient world, one should be able to map the data from psychology to the theory in sociobiology. Although a lot of work had been published on altruism in both areas, the project turned out to be all but impossible. The definitions of altruism in the two fields were incommensurable. Genetic self-sacrifice in sociobiology was not</page><page sequence="6">214 CAPORAEL the kind of measurable variable that psychologists could manipulate in a field ex- periment. As for kin selection and reciprocal altruism-it was no news to psychol- ogists or anyone else that people help their relatives and return favors. For its part, sociobiology was silent on the forms of altruism and the psychological mecha- nisms psychologists studied. What was interesting was that how humans thought about their relationships, in terms of reciprocity and kinship, could be applied to other animals (although some biologists made it seem as if altruism was first dis- covered in nonhuman animals and then recognized in humans). That the intersection of sociobiology and psychology would be almost empty was something of a surprise. There were other surprises in the sociobiology litera- ture, too. From a historical point of view, Darwinism had demonstrable impacts in political and social life (including impacts measured in the costs of lives). Yet it had failed to produce research findings about human nature that have widespread acceptance in the human sciences. From a sociological perspective, Darwinism has to be the most democratic of sciences. Even psychologists do not conduct their fights in The New York Review ofBooks. Unlike physics or chemistry, or even ex- perimental social psychology, sociobiology was a game in which anyone could play. From a scientific perspective, the founding father biologists, who were say- ing that evolution would illuminate the most intimate details of the human psyche and social life, had apparently never read nor cited the existing scientific literature in social psychology. Could we imagine a chemist claiming polymerization would illuminate the most intimate details of cellular processes without having read the scientific literature in biology? Sociobiologists were giving evolutionary explana- tions for the ordinary stuff of everyday life-marriage, divorce, and kids fighting in the playroom seemed to take on new significance when they were echoed by ge- netic explanations of mating, mate desertion, and genetic competition between siblings. By default, population geneticists were "explaining" folk psychology. I used to take these observations as outrageous violations of scientific norms. Eventually I realized these were data, much like the oddities of structure and be- havior, the obvious signs of poor design, so dear to Darwin and his followers. Eventually, any evolutionary theory worth its salt will have to explain them. (Maybe, perish the thought, folk psychology explains the evolutionary theories.) Although I agree with Wilson's assessment of some of the sillier experiments in postmodernism, he has missed a general point that those of us in the human sci- ences, especially psychology, also need to recognize. Whatever else we may lay at postmodernism's door, it has sensitized us to the fact that there are a variety of ways of viewing the world. It invites us to inquire about the grounds and the cir- cumstances for privileging some world views over others. (As Wilson under- stands, even the claim that all world views are equal privileges itself.) Postmodernism also encourages us in a hygienic kind of reflexivity, a looking over our shoulder to understand better from where we are coming.</page><page sequence="7">BOOKS &amp; IDEAS 215 Unlike scientists who learned their postmodemrnism from the polemical defense of scientific purity by Gross and Levitt (1994; which is like learning our evolution from Duane Gish, creation scientist), Wilson is restrained in his criticisms of postmodemism. In his catchall description he includes "Latourian sociology of science." Yet, interestingly, the diagram (p. 10) illustrating the problem that consilience should solve could have come straight from Latour's book, We Have Never Been Modemrn (1993). Wilson draws a quadrant superimposed by a target with the bull's eye over the crosshairs of the axes. The quadrant represents the dis- ciplines of biology, social science, ethics, and environmental policy. As we move closer to the center of the target, Wilson tells us, we move closer to the region where real world problems exist. To resolve them, we need to create hybrid do- mains, where the social sciences and humanities are made consilient with the natu- ral sciences. Latour (1993) hypothesized two sets of practices that have remained effectively distinct in modem science. One set of practices, purification (which includes "pure science" as well as deconstructionism as methods), creates two distinct domains. The science domain draws boundaries around facts, nature, and artifacts, and the society domain encloses values, culture, and politics. Another set of practices, translation, creates hybrids of science and society, facts and values, and nature and culture in a single public domain. We see translation and hybridization everyday when we pick up a newspaper and find a perfectly understandable story about problems measuring the ozone layer, CEOs of chemical manufacturing plants, pronouncements of government officials, and comments from consumers and pro- testors all in a single article. For the most part, these hybrids vanish when they are segmented and assigned to different academic disciplines; in the example of our news article, these include physics, biology, manufacturing engineering, political science, economics, and psychology. Partaking as it does of human origins and human nature, the hybrid character of Darwinism cannot be made to vanish. Evolutionary theory applied to humans, as Darwin may have realized in his own terminology, defies purification at- tempts. All he ventured to say about humans in The Origin of Species is that psychology would someday be illuminated by the theory of natural selection. The problems of purification and translation come up again in Kitcher's (1985) critique of sociobiology. He allowed that animal sociobiology is scientific, but human sociobiology is merely folk psychology, the belief that individuals more or less rationally pursue outcomes of purely personal value. Latour (1993) wrote that purification and translation are necessary to each other. There would be no need for purification if science were truly detached from the needs, practices, and values of the social domain. Likewise, there would be no need for transla- tion if humans did not value, need, and use science and technology (Latour, 1993), and there is the rub.</page><page sequence="8">216 CAPORAEL Evolutionary theory, especially sociobiology and its offspring, evolutionary psychology, cannot so easily be detached from deep concerns. Some arise from is- sues of origins, where Dennett starts his book. Others arise from social relation- ships, including those with children, lovers, and neighbors. (Note how social psychology achieves its detachment by being largely a "stranger psychology.") These common concerns may or may not be assuaged when genes are said to be in- volved, with their implications of constraints and resistance to change-or relief of responsibility. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Darwinism, the claims made in its name are important because science speaks with a special authority. (Why else would evolution's opponents claim a creation science?) These complications of translation produce the paradox of a hybrid science, one that prevents us from creating a scientific domain distinct from a social and cul- tural one. This hybrid science is different from that of Wilson's. It is one in which values, culture, and standpoint are as overtly relevant to the scientific issues as the science itself. Values, culture, and standpoint are not the substitute for science-as Latour (1993) noted, a little too much relativism sends one back to realism. Some- how, they must be brought in as partners in science. In Wilson's hybrid science, humanities and social sciences play no such reflec- tive role; the scientist does not shift position between inquiry and critique, as if squinting with one eye and then the other to get a better picture of the phenomena. Instead, there is a prefixing of biology as in bioethics, biopoetics, or bioaesthetics. Wilson's consilience of disciplines is less the induction of one class of facts to an- other class of facts than it is the reduction of one class to another. In the human case, the reduction short circuits critical reflection on the so-called facts-what is and what should be the source of our ideas on human nature? What is the function of folk psychology? How do should we incorporate current knowledge about cog- nitive bias and limitations into criteria for evolutionary theorizing? These are not idle questions. They are critical sources of fresh insights for human evolutionary theory. If Darwinism is ineluctably mired in culture, and culture, broadly speak- ing, is a biological product, then the content of human evolutionary theorizing has to include a backward or reflexive look at how scientists and lay people use biol- ogy and culture. This is not a modus operandi in Dennett's and Wilson's books when they turn to the problem of culture. BRIDGES OVER TROUBLED WATERS According to Wilson, the route for consilience between the two cultures of science and humanities is the "conceptual bridge" between genes and culture. The crux of the problem is this: What, in the final analysis, joins the deep, mostly genetic his- tory of the species as a whole to the more recent cultural histories of its far-flung so- cieties? Wilson's response is gene-culture evolution, of which the snake dream is</page><page sequence="9">BOOKS &amp; IDEAS 217 an illustration. Genes provide archetypes, constraints, and biases from which cul- ture creates metaphors and narratives. Likewise, culture affects which genes are likely to be passed on to succeeding generations. Where does culture come from? "Culture is created by the communal mind, and each mind in turn is the product of the genetically structured human brain" (p. 127). Wilson claims to reject genetic determinism, and throughout Consilience, there is language that suggests the possibility of a more concrete understanding of the in- terrelationships between complex developmental systems and evolutionary the- ory. In place of genetic determinism, he substitutes the more sophisticated formulation of epigenetic rules. Epigenesis is "the development of the organism under the joint influence of heredity and environment" (p. 193). Well enough, but in the very next line, the role of the environment is snatched away: "Epigenetic rules ... are innate operations in the sensory system and the brain" (p. 193). The short shrift given to the environment is an unavoidable consequence of an evolu- tionary theory based on genes rather than a more general multilevel selection the- ory or a developmental systems theory. Like other sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists, Wilson subscribes to an old-style interactionism between genes and environment. In this view, genes are responsible for biological bases of behavior. These bases are distinct from the social environment of development, as if the human nature part of the psyche could be isolated from the social part of its formation. (Wilson asks if social regu- lations exist to repress human nature or to express it.) In old-style interactionism, the social environment may shift the expression of the biological bases within a norm of reaction, but it is not an intrinsic part of evolved human nature. Yet, why should the biological bases be privileged for human nature if they are one of many resources that need to be coordinated for the production of nature? Contrast old-style interactionism with what could be called "constructive interactionism." In this case the organism, and human nature, are the result ofjoint influence. In fact, genes, a language environment, a primary caregiver, and a face-to-face group are all necessary resources for the development of a human na- ture. A host of resources, from gravity to human-made artifacts are necessary for human nature. Should any of the items mentioned in the preceding two sentences be absent, we do not get a human organism within a range of normal variation, ca- pable of reproducing life and reassembling the necessities for forging the next links in the chain of life. The organism, from conception through death, is an ongo- ing result of constructive process. One of the consequences of constructive interactionism is that the brain could, in fact, be a blank slate at birth. Gerald Edelman's notion of "neural Darwinism" would help to explain the regularities in human nature given regularities in the developing human's environment. Of course, the first task would be to identify the regularities of the environment. Dennett's idea for crossing the gene-culture chasm is memes. Dennett calls them invaders, viruses, or body snatchers. The advertising jingle that you cannot</page><page sequence="10">218 CAPORAEL get out of your mind is a meme; the fight with your partner that you cannot get out of your mind is not. Memes are ideas or, at their smallest, snippets of meaning. They are more or less identifiable units of culture that can be imitated. The idea of memes capitalizes on the fundamental features of natural selection: variability, he- redity, and differential replication. Memes reproduce by infecting other minds, the meme nests in their infosphere ecology. Due to these memes, we are still able to exercise free will, creative thought, and moral judgment. What changes is the com- mon notion of self. It is not the apparently autonomous "I'" that seems to inhabit our internal landscapes. Rather selves or egos "have been created out of the inter- play of memes exploiting and redirecting the machinery Mother Nature has given us" (p. 367). Different coalitions of memes can be in the driver's seat guiding be- havior (e.g., eating that bacon burger with cheese) while other coalitions of memes swarm on the sidelines wishing to diet. Dennett says there are people who hate memes, and I confess to being one of them (a mismemethropist?). The idea promotes the description of culture as a stimulus and mind as a response. The rank anthropomorphism gives an illusion of understanding while obscuring meaning. Although people talk about memes as if they were like genes, the only commonality is that both memes and genes are treated as self-interested decision-making entities controlling their human machines. Yet, memes have their uses. The notion allows us to articulate ideas that are oth- erwise difficult, especially for scientists, to articulate. My candidates for meme membership are the stealth memes. Some memes are so deeply entrenched in a culture, so evocative of its ethos, and so crucial to shareable communication, that they defy extinction. Childhood stories of angels and devils sitting on our shoul- ders and whispering in our ears are not so easily wiped out. According to Dennett, "there is a persisting tension between the biological imperatives of our genes on the one hand and the cultural imperatives of our memes on the other, but we would be foolish to 'side with' our genes" (p. 365). Novel ideas piggyback on the deeply entrenched stealth memes. They are easy to understand, thus enhancing the meme's replication, but deforming the subsequent lineage of ideas to be more like earlier, more familiar versions. This is what has happened to Darwinism, what makes it so nonrevolutionary in its description of human nature. When sociobiology was brought from popu- lation genetics to human behavior, it stuck to religion like a complementary strand of DNA. Like the immortal soul, the immortal DNA is the essence of the person. Both respectively occupy the ephemeral body, vessel of the soul, and the transitory phenotype, vehicle of the genes. The right behavior, altruism or self- ishness, respectively, can lead to immortality, either through salvation or to hav- ing one's genes represented in succeeding populations. Natural selection, the blind watchmaker, replaces the creative agency of God, Divine Watchmaker. Humans lost their natural environment, much as they lost the Garden of Eden. It</page><page sequence="11">BOOKS &amp; IDEAS 219 is tempting to lay this correspondence on Wilson's doorstep. As a fundamental- ist southern Baptist growing up in the "Christian civilization of 1940s Ala- bama," Wilson has known "the healing power of redemption" (p. 6). However, Dennett repeats a bit of redemptive advice along the theme of original sin and resisting temptation that can also be found in the works of Richard Dawkins and George C. Williams. Dennett says we "can rise above the imperatives of our genes ... thanks to our memes" (p. 365) and, with our meme-infested brains, "rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators" (p. 471). No wonder creationists are embattled with evolutionists. It looks like a secular priesthood in biology stole the origin story of Western culture. AN INTENTIONAL HYBRID One of the reasons why Darwinism hardly seems revolutionary compared to femi- nism is because it preserves organizing assumptions that predate Darwin. Feminist standpoints continue to provide new insights on the world, however debatable those may be. Sociobiology's excitement comes from the recycling of nature-nur- ture dualism, which does have currency in pubic debates for assigning roles and re- sponsibility, but not from new visions of human nature. In their explanations of cul- ture, both Dennett and Wilson share a view of individualistic self-interested human nature originating in the Enlightenment (Dennett calls Hobbes the first sociobiologist) and not quite separable from its religious sensibilities. Both assume that there are "basic units" of culture, reducible to genes or memes, that can be used to explain more complex phenomena. Both emphasize the symbolic properties of language as the primary cultural stuff, which can enter and leave minds. Both pre- suppose internal representative theories of mind and, as is customary for such theo- ries, the body is more or less dispensable. (Wilson writes that the body is important, but what he means is that a machine programmed with an artificial mind would also have to have its memory banks filled with artificial sensory experiences.) There are other approaches, even more compatible with Darwin's method and his concept of descent with modification (e.g., theoretical frameworks coming from systems theory, distributed cognition theories or cultural-historical activity approaches). However, the familiar and deeply conceptual structures in our culture pose a formidable obstacle to new approaches, especially if Darwinism is expected to be populist fare. (This is not an advisory to retreat to the upper reaches of the ivory tower.) To release human evolutionary theory, we need to reconstruct it as a different kind of science. Consilience, not as a reduction from one class of facts to another, but as conver- gence among different classes of facts, would be another variety of hybrid science. It would neither exclude the hybrid disciplines of Wilson, nor would it be trapped between purification and translation as in Latour's hybrids. It would be, to take a</page><page sequence="12">220 CAPORAEL phrase from Dennett's corpus, an intentional hybrid. As a postmodern science, hu- man evolutionary theory would take the best of the humanities and social sciences to reflect on the language we use and its fit with other ideas and practices. It would find and disentangle the work Darwinism does as science from the work it does as origin myth. It would recognize that there are "gray zones" between science and culture where passions run high, and that these must be studied from several differ- ent perspectives with the cleverest methodologies and research designs. To briefly illustrate what this approach may buy us, suppose we simply dis- carded the old conviction that we're adapted to life on the savanna. Certainly some aspects of our physiology, such as sweating, are best explained as heat adaptations. However, humans have evolved in the context of group living, with physical con- straints on both minimum and maximum group sizes. For those unique aspects of human mental systems that most interest us, the face-to-face group, not the habitat, was the mind's natural environment. Consequently, humans are not just the self-interested creatures imagined by Hobbes. They are, first and foremost, social creatures: They may be selfish at times, but obligate group-living constrains self-interest. Far from having lost their natural environment, its key fea- ture-face-to-face groups-are still the locus of action and are still available for investigation. Sociality is not necessarily too cheerful for hardheaded cynical sci- ence. Ethnic conflicts are a side ofsociality. So, perhaps, is environmental destruc- tion. Being adapted to group living, we may be too removed from the habitat to possess the love of nature Wilson posits as a species-typical characteristic. (As one of my students said, "Why worry about the world being paved over? You'll still have virtual grass if you want grass.") The Enlightenment gave us freedoms and ideals that we can barely imagine liv- ing without, but it also gave us only a sliver of understanding about human nature and its self-invention. It would be a shame to put Darwinism to the task of preserv- ing that sliver rather than finding new territories. REFERENCES Caporael, L. R. (1976). Ergotism: The Satan loosed in Salem?
