<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOING WITH THE WIND: VISUALIZING VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN THE PSEUDO-VERGILIAN AETNA1 MYRTO GARANI The anonymous poet of Aetna writes a didactic poem, in his effort to denounce myths associated with the terrifying phenomenon of volcanic eruptions, shed light upon its unseen mechanism, and unfetter his pupil from irrational fears. Quite disappointingly, however, a quick browse among the available commentaries makes us wonder whether the poem has been affected by the very same volcanic mechanisms which it describes. It looks as if volcanic lava has overflowed the manuscripts and resulted in severe uncertainty regarding essential elements of the poem (i.e. the identity of the author, its date, even worse the text itself). For many decades scholars have tried to tidy up the text and identify its author.2 This uncertainty resulted in less effort being made to explore its content and trace down its intertextual sources. Posidonius, Theophrastus, Lucretius, and Seneca are often identified as possible candidates.3 Along the same lines, according to the prevailing opinion, the poem 1 1 am grateful to Frances Muecke, who commented on an earlier draft of this paper and communicated to me her 'volcanic' research. I would like to thank Stavroula Kiritsi in London and Maria Ypsilanti in Cyprus for kindly providing me with material otherwise inaccessible. Unless otherwise stated, I follow the text of J. W.

Cambridge Classical Texts and Commentaries 2 (Cambridge 1965). 2 The poem is usually dated about the middle 1st cent. AD. In any case it cannot have been written after AD 79, the year of the disastrous eruption of Vesuvius. As far as the authorship is concerned, Cornelius Severus and Lucilius Junior, Seneca's correspondent and procurator of Sicily, have been identified as the main candidates. See J. H.

In the present article, a detailed analysis of the analogies by means of which the poet elucidates the role of the winds as regards the obscure phenomenon in question will be attempted. At a second level, the main source of the poem will be reconsidered. It will eventually turn out that the current scholarship does not do full justice to the poetic and scientific value of the poem, since it nearly annihilates the creative independence of the author. The poet complies with the common opinion which considers air as the agent of both volcanic and seismic activity (56 1-68): 4 his uiribus additur ingens spiritus, adstrictis elisus faucibus: ut cum fabriles operae rudibus contendere massis festinant, ignes quatiunt follesque trementes exanimant, pressoque instigant agmine uentum. 565 haec operis forma est, sic nobilis uritur Aetna: terra foraminibus uires trahit, urget in artum spiritus, incendi uia fit per maxima saxa. With these mighty forces is allied the gigantic volcanic spirit forced out of strait- ened jaws, as when mechanics hasten to pit their strength against masses of natural iron, they stir the fires and, expelling the wind from panting bellows, rouse the current in close array. Such is the manner of its working: so goes far-famed Aetna's burning. The earth draws in forces through her perforations; volcanic spirit compresses these into narrow space, and the path of conflagration lies through the mightiest rocks. Aetna is conceptualized as a great furnace within which fire is generated by the force of the bellows-action of winds. Flammable materials within the volcano are thus ignited and an eruption is brought about. Lava-stone is considered the aliment for the volcanic fires. The poet systematically appeals to sensory evidence and states that he will reveal by analogy the unseen nature of the phenomenon (143-45):5 Lucretius en de Aetna-dichter', Lampas 22 (1989) 22-35; with Seneca see A.

These (caves) will furnish true proofs of a depth unknown to us. Let but your mind guide you to grasp of cunning research: from things manifest gather faith in the unseen. Analogical thinking is mainly employed in connection with all the ideas encapsulated in verses 567-68 quoted above, i.e. the perforated structure of the earth which allows the circulation of wind, the underground motion of the winds, and finally the production of volcanic lava.6 a. The perforated structure of earth (94-142): The poet launches his expository account by establishing the fact that the earth in general - not just a volcano - is full of holes; this concept is set as a prerequisite for the motion of wind within the volcano (98-101): utque animanti per tota errantes percurrunt corpora uenae ad uitam sanguis omnis qua commeat eidem, terra uoraginibus conceptas digerii auras. As in a living creature veins run through the whole body with wandering course, along which passes every drop of blood to feed life for the selfsame organism, so the earth by its chasms draws in and distributes currents of air. In the first instance, he compares the inner hollowness of earth, which is full of cracks and chasms ( voraginibus , 101), with the veins of a living human being (venae, 99); in this case, the blood passing through human veins is compared with air (auras, 101). This analogy is taken for granted further down, when the poet refers to the consequence of the compression of air within earth which forces a way out and generates an earthquake. The anthropo- morphic visualization of earth is already employed by Aristotle (e.g. Mete. 366bl4ff., 368a6ff., 368b23ff.) and henceforth with the 'domesticating' function in scientific contexts about earthquakes and volcanoes, all of which are cogently considered as Aetna's sources (e.g. Lucretius, DRN 6.591-600 on earthquakes, 6.647-72 on volcanoes; Seneca, Nat. Quaest. VI. 14.1, 21.2, 24.2 on earthquakes). As Williams remarks, the (Stoic) theory of 'vital air' that Seneca accepts as the cause of earthquakes is consonant with the concept of a living cosmos.7 Seneca makes a distinction between veins (venae) and arteries (&lt; arteriae ), the former defined as receptacles for blood (sanguis compared with aqua), the latter as receptacles for air Epicurean adherence. Such expressions, however, occur also in Posidonius (135-36, 143-45, 191-93, 330-31, 448-49, 548 E-K [L. Edelstein and I. G. Kidd, Posidonius : the fragments (vol. I) (Cambridge 1972)]). Further on Posidonius see I. G. Kidd, Posidonius: the commentary (vols. II i-ii) (Cambridge 1988) and Posidonius: the translation of the fragments (vol. Ill) (Cambridge 1999). 6 1 will confine myself to the discussion of the analogies involving winds, which dominate in the poem. There are, however, other analogies related, for example, to the substance of the lapis molaris (479ff., 550ff.), the flowing of lava out of the volcanic orifices like waves (494-500). 7 G. D. Williams, 'Greco-Roman seismology and Seneca on earthquakes in Natural Questions 6', JRS 96 (2006) 124-46, at 134ff. with further bibliography.</page><page sequence="4">106 BICS-52 - 2009 ( spiritus ) (III. 15.1). 8 The poet of Aetna, on the contrary, by comparing the behaviour of a liquid (i.e. blood) with that of air, seems to eliminate this distinction in his analogy. Taking for granted the perforated structure of earth, the poet sets forward multiple explanations in order to shed light upon it. To begin with, he refers to the very first formation of earth (102-10): scilicet aut olim diuiso corpore mundi 1 02 in maria ac terras et sidera, sors data cáelo prima, secuta maris, deseditque infima tellus, sed tortis rimosa cauis; et qualis aceruus 105 exilit imparibus iactis ex tempore saxis, ut crebro introrsus spatio uacuata f charybdis pendeat in sese, simili quoque terra figura in tenuis laxata uias, non omnis in artum nec stipata coit: Either, I mean, when of old the body of the universe was divided into sea, earth and stars, the first portion was given to the sky, then followed that of the sea, and earth sank down lowest of the three, albeit fissured by winding hollows; and even as a heap springs out of stones of uneven shape thrown at random, so as to form a charybdis hollowed with frequent interstices within and hanging upon itself, even so in like configuration the earth, too, loosened into tiny channels, does not all unite compactly or into narrow compass. Parallel accounts about the first distribution of the four elements usually emphasize the fact that the elements of earth are placed at the bottom.9 In the present case, however, the poet describes the perforated structure of the earth per se ( tortis rimosa cavis, 105) and the relentless impact of the other three elements upon it. The actual earth is compared with a miniature one: as a heap of stones formed by fortuitous accumulation cannot be completely solid, in a similar way, when the earth was first created, its pieces gathered together without aptly fitting together like a jigsaw-puzzle. In other words, the poet compares the similar behaviour of earthy pieces in different proportions, in order to visualize the unseen structure of the earth, unchanged in general terms since the beginning of the world. At the same time, provided we accept that in line 107 a second simile begins {ut...), as some scholars have plausibly argued, a supplementary image is insinuated within the primary analogy, which likens the porous earth to the whirlpool of the Straits of Messina ( Charybdis ); this would then convey the image of numerous channels forged within earth.10 This double image employed so as to bring before our eyes different 8 Cf also in Lucr. DRN 6.591-600 the comparison of the wind's action shut in the caverns of the earth with that of cold causing shuddering within the human body. 9 Lucr. DRN 5.449 ff.; Ov. Met. 1.2 Iff. Fasti 5.1 Iff.; Manilius 1.150ff. 10 Paisley and Oldroyd, 'Science in the Silver Age' (n. 2, above) 10-11. Cf. B. Rhem, 'Aetna 107', Philologus 90 (1935-36) 250-53; Goodyear, Incerti auctoris Aetna (n. 1, above) 126; Ascione, 'Studi recenti sull'Aetna, I' (n. 2, above) 273-74. Note the connection of Aetna with Charybdis in Justin Hist. iv. 1.1 1-15, who maintains that the same natural causes lie behind the great whirlpools formed by the sinking of the sea (the sailors thought that barking was coming from the waves as they collided in the maelstrom when the current sucked them down) and the permanent fires of Aetna caused by the clashing of waters. For more on this passage see also below.</page><page sequence="5">MYRTO GARANI: VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN AETNA 107 aspects of a single obscure phenomenon (i.e. the cause of the existence of holes within the earth and the description of its structure) should be considered as a case of a multi- dimensional simile, which was already refined by Lucretius; this point will be revisited below, where another such case occurs, in a more elaborated and - comparatively - stable form (294-301). The poet provides other plausible causes of the earth's erosion which have been active unremittingly within it ever since its creation.11 The earth may well crumble due to the action of air, which thus crafts the way through which it moves underground {sed liber spiritus intrat / et fugiens molitur iter , 'but some air enters unchecked and works a road as it escapes', 1 1 1-12). Other possible factors are said to be the action of water {seu lympha perenni /edit humum limo furtimque obstantia mollit , 'or water has eaten away the ground with the mud it perpetually makes and stealthily softens what blocks its course', 113-14), or of hot vapours {aut etiam inclusi solidům vicere vapores, / atque igni quaesita via est , 'or again hot vapours cribbed and confined have overcome solidity and fire has sought a path for itself, 1 14-15), or finally the battle of all the elements together {sive omnia certis / pugnavere locis , 'or all these forces may have striven in their assigned places', 115-16). In theory, the poet does not decide on any explanation. It is, however, quite intriguing that there is only one analogy used in connection with the first cause, which is granted almost nine verses; in contrast, the other possible causes are treated in just one or two lines and this creates the impression of an anticlimax, which could suggest the prioritization of the first one. Yet, it should not escape us that the first analogy refers to an obscure event that has taken place in the past and thus further explanation is needed. Besides, the poet hastens to make up for this brevity in the following lines. After the digression about the causes of the phenomenon, the poet appeals to common experience, in order to establish further the invisible structure of the earth. Firstly, he counterbalances his omission of an analogy about the erosive action of water within earth by pointing to the existence of rivers and springs on earth which disappear underground and resurface (132-36): quod si praecipiti conduntur flumina terra, condita si redeunt, si quaedam incondita surgunt, 133 haud mirum clausis etiam si libera uentis spiramenta latent, certis tibi pignora rebus 135 atque oculis haesura tuis dabit ordine tellus. But if rivers are buried in a sheer abyss of earth, if some which are buried come back to light and others without such burial rise from earth, no wonder is it that confined winds have liberating vents which are concealed. Proofs of this through facts indisputable, proofs which hold the eye, the earth will give you in due order. This, in turn, proves that there are also rivers underneath; therefore, on a second level the poet assumes that, if there are channels for water, there can also be similar passages for the movement of air. The vocabulary employed here about earth's breathing holes {libera 11 Vetustas (110-11) should not be considered as a separate cause. Cf. Lucr. DRN 6.553. Cf. on the contrary Goodyear, Incerti auctoris Aetna (n. 1, above) 127, who compares this passage with Seneca's Nat. Quaest. VI.10.1.</page><page sequence="6">108 BICS-52 - 2009 spiramenta , 134-35) strikingly resumes the analogy with the human being. This projection supplements the latter analogy, since it vindicates how it comes about that wind within earth can be compared with a liquid similar to water, i.e. blood. The poet, then, adds a further argument by appealing to the existence of chasms and caverns on the surface of the earth, which suggests a similar inner structure and hence allows for the circulation of air (137-42). b. Personification of Winds: The writer consistently sustains the personification of all four elements (i.e. earth, air, fire, water). As is expected, special emphasis is placed upon the presentation of wind, since it is considered the instigator of the volcanic eruption.12 Wind is envisaged as an artificer ( faber , 198), in line with the Stoic view that air is the cohesive element in the world. Winds are referred to either in the singular or plural, suggesting their collective power. When imagined as several individuals, they appear to form an army and then fight (pugnarti in faucibus , 320; adstrictus cert amine, 324; ventorum examina , 373). When enclosed, they rage and strive to loose their bonds and get free (semper in inclusis nec ventis segnior ira est, / sub terra penitusque novent hoc plura necesse est, / vincla magis solvant, magis hoc obstantia pellant , 'as the rage of winds is no less vehement there, so to this extent, underground and in earth's depths, must fire and wind cause greater changes, all the more loose their bonds, all the more drive off what blocks their course', 147-49; cf. 134-35). They show a discipline and act together, by making a mutual treaty (nosse quid impediat ventos, quid nutriat illos, / unde repente quies et muto foedere pax sit , 'to learn what hinders winds, what nurtures them, whence their sudden calm and the silent covenant of their truce', 281-82). They may also be at peace, but then fight anew (tanta quies Uli est et pax innoxia rapti. / sive peregrinis igitur propriisve potentes / coniurant animae causis , 'so profound is that sleep of the air, a peace guiltless of ravin. Whether then it is through extraneous or internal causes that the winds make their puissant alliance', 358-60; post, ubi conticuere, mora velocius urgent: / pellunt oppositi moles ac vincula rumpunt , 'Later, after their silent spell, they press on the swifter for the delay: they dislodge the masses of rock which they face: they burst their bonds', 380-81). Wind may have control over its own power (cum rexit vires et praeceps flexit habenas , 'when once it has controlled its powers and put a sudden check on the reins', 346). Regarding its action towards fire, wind is now the emperor, fire obeys (qua spiritus imperat, audit; / hie princeps magnoque sub hoc duce militât ignis , 'where spirit is commander, it obeys. Spirit is emperor: fire serves in the army of this great captain', 217-18). Yet, when winds are almost asleep (torpentes auras , 293), the water needs to give them the impulse. At this point, we should turn to a famous passage from Seneca's Naturales Quaestiones (VI. 18.1-5): 13 [18.1] Maxima ergo causa est propter quam terra moueatur spiritus natura citus et locum e loco mutans. Hic, quamdiu non impellitur et in uacanti spatio latet, iacet innoxius nec circumiectis molestus est; [18.2] Ubi ilium extrinsecus superueniens 12 Goodyear, 'The "Aetna"' (n. 3, above) 360-63. 13 A. De Vivo, Le parole della scienza: sul trattato De terrae motu di Seneca (Salerno 1992) 61-66, Williams, 'Greco-Roman seismology* (n. 7, above) 136-37.</page><page sequence="7">MYRTO GARANI: VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN AETNA 1 09 causa sollicitât compellitque et in artum agit, si licet adhuc, cedit tantum et uagatur: ubi erepta discedendi facultas est et undique obsistitur, tunc 'magno cum murmure montis / circum claustra' frémit, quae diu pulsata conuellit ac iactat, eo acrior quo cum mora ualentiore luctatus est. [18.3] Deinde cum circa perlustrauit omne quo tenebatur nec potuit euadere, inde, quo maxime impactus est, resilit et aut per occulta diuiditur ipso terrae motu raritate facta, aut per nouum uulnus emicuit: ita eius non potest uis tanta cohiberi nec uentum tenet ulla compages. Soluit enim quodcumque uinculum et onus omne fert secum infususque per minima laxamentum sibi parat et indomita naturae potentia libérât se, utique cum concitatus sibi ius suum uindicat. [18.4] Spiritus ueto inuicta res est: nihil erit quod 'luctantes uentos tempestatesque sonoras / imperio premat ac uinclis et carcere frenet.' [18.5] Sine dubio poetae hunc uoluerunt uideri carcerem in quo sub terra clausi laterent; sed hoc non intellexerunt, nec id quod clausum est esse adhuc uentum nec id quod uentus est posse iam claudi. Nam quod in clauso est quiescit et aeris statio est; omnis in fuga uentus est. Accordingly, the principal cause of an earthquake is air, swift by nature and changing from place to place. As long as it is not shoved and it lurks in a vacant space, it lies harmless and is no trouble to surrounding areas. When a cause coming from outside stirs it up and pushes it together and drives it into a narrow space it merely gives way and shifts about if it is still permitted to do so. When the chance of getting away is cut off and it is beset on all sides then: "With a mighty rumbling of the mountain / around the barriers" it rages, and after beating against these barriers a long time the air pulls them apart and hurls them aside, becoming more violent the stronger the obstacles with which it has struggled. Then when it has wandered around all that restrains it and is still unable to get out it rebounds from where it received the greatest impact and is either dissipated through hidden openings made here and there by the consequent movement itself of the earth or erupts through a new wound. Thus the great force of air cannot be checked, nor does any compact structure hold this wind. For it loosens any bond and carries every weight away with it and makes a space for itself, pouring through the smallest fissures. By the indomitable force of its nature air frees itself and especially when agitated it asserts its right for itself. But moving air is an unconquerable thing; nothing will exist which "represses by authority / or restrains by chains and prison / the winds when they struggle / and the storms when they roar". Undoubtedly the poets wanted this place where the winds lie shut in under the ground to be considered a prison. But they did not understand that what is shut is not longer wind and that which is wind is in flight, (trans. Corcoran, see n. 43 below) Seneca strikingly refers here to the action of the winds in vocabulary similar to that which is employed by the writer of Aetna. 14 Even more remarkably Seneca's image is already packed 14 E.g. luctatus est , solvit ... vinculum, indomita naturae potentia libérât se.</page><page sequence="8">110 BICS-52 - 2009 with intertextual allusions to Aetna's other main target-texts.15 More precisely, Seneca explicitly quotes the Vergilian storm in the first book of the Aeneid (Aen. 1.50-63) in order to demythologize it;16 in his turn, Vergil looks back at Lucretius' De Rerum Natura (6.185- 203) and recharges with mythological content an image in which winds enclosed within mountain-like clouds are depicted like raging beasts within cages.17 In all of these allusions, winds are visualized in similar anthropomorphic terms, albeit with clashing purposes.18 Hence, Aetna is revealed to form part of a dense intertextual chain which carries along specific significance as far as the personification of winds is concerned.19 In this respect, a closer look at the Vergilian description of Aeolus and the Cave of the Winds turns out to be particularly instructive. Hardie offers us a persuasive discussion about the resemblance of the imprisoned winds to that of the imprisoned Titans in Hesiod's Theogony (729ff.). Hesiodic winds are the children of Eos and the Titan Astraeus ( Theog . 378ff). Typhoeus, already associated himself with the typhoon-wind (typhos, typhoon), is said to give birth to ill winds {Theog. 869ff.). More to the point, Hardie stresses the fact that there was a sustained allegorical association of the winds with Titans or Giants, those two being closely associated in Greek mythology. The Byzantine commentators on the Theogony interpret the battles of Zeus against the Titans and Typhoeus in elemental and meteorological terms, by taking them to symbolize the seasonally recurring struggles between cold and warm which threaten all parts of the world with destruction.20 As for the origin of such interpretations one should principally look at the older Stoa. It suffices to recall here Zeno' s etymological explanation of the name "Titans" in a physical sense, as the elements which are distributed in an orderly way throughout cosmos (11. 6-8 Di Gregorio); moreover, according to Diogenes Laertius (7.175), Cleanthes wrote a - now lost - work entitled IIspi riyávrcov.21 15 This is a case of 'double-allusion' in Seneca. For the term see P. Hardie, 'The speech of Pythagoras in Ovid's Metamorphoses 15: Empedoclean epos', CQ n.s. 45 (1995) 204-14. For Vergilian influence see Della Corte, Appendix Vergiliana (n. 2, above) 84-87. 16 Williams, 'Greco-Roman seismology' (n. 7, above) 135ff. 17 For Vergil's recharging of the Lucretian model with mythological content see P.

How does Aetna respond towards the other rings of the intertextual chain to which it belongs? While the poet keeps the personification of winds in the body of his scientific account, as we have already seen above, and thus recalls the Stoic allegory of Giants and Titans, in line with Seneca, at the same time he takes pains to unambiguously demythologize the prime agent of volcanic eruptions. In other words, while Seneca makes a direct juxtaposition between his scientific approach and the Vergilian one, Aetna replies to Vergil by overtly refuting the mythical theomachy. The poem is prefaced with a rather overgrown introduction in proportion to the rest of the work, as has often been observed (1-93). 22 What is particularly interesting, however, is the fact that one third of it is devoted to the refutation of the mythological explanation of the story that the fires of Aetna are a relic of the battle of the giants against the god (41-74) and that Enceladus is buried beneath Aetna and breathes fire from his mouth. This section is elaborated into a yiyavxojiaxia in which various stages of the assault upon the gods by the giants are described, along with their final overthrow and the return of peace to the sky. The two armies are sketched in strong contrast, on the one hand Jupiter hurling his thunderbolt and the gods, on the other the giants in disorder.23 Winds are present in this account; yet, they noticeably stand on Jupiter's side, signaling the subversion of the myth (57-58): in what follows the poet is about to substitute the winds for the giant imprisoned under Aetna.24 c. Causes of setting the winds in motion (219-81): Having established the fact that Aetna's activity is due to the action of winds, the poet undertakes to answer the question how it comes that the air is set in motion: "Whence come the winds themselves? What feeds the conflagration?" (unde ipsi venti? quae res incendia pascti?, 220). For this purpose he shifts the focus from the inner structure of the earth to describe the earth's surface; as he claims, there are both large openings (« cavernae , 283) and small apertures (i minutis ...foraminibus , 284-85) on it, by means of which the winds may intrude into the earth. Saying this, nevertheless he considers the small passages the more likely route for the hostile winds, to which Aetna is exposed on either side; this is stated in an explanatory parenthesis which buttresses his argument (286-89).

This is the second instance in the poem in which several possible causes are expounded. First, the poet puts forward two factors that may be active outside the earth and possibly initiate the downwards motion of the winds. He points to the action of clouds and the cloud-laden South Wind ( nubes and nubilus Auster , 290), without expounding this cause any further; yet, he will come back to it further on, when he compares the action of compressed winds with that of waves piled up (319-26), an analogy which will be discussed below. Moreover, the present image of various winds in action reminds us of another description in the poem, where it is argued that the seismic activity is not occasioned near the surface where we see broad cavities and openings {fervei opus densaque premit premiturque ruina / nunc Euri Boreaeque Notus , nunc huius uterque. 'Hot glows the work: now the South Wind presses or is pressed on by the thick swoop of the East Wind and the North: now, again, both these winds by a current from the South', 169-70). Another possible cause is the down-pouring rain ( deiecta...unda , 292) which acts upon the sluggish air-currents {seu fortes flexere caput tergoque feruntur , 291; torpentes auras , 293), by pressure condenses their elements and increases their force. This cause requires further elucidation and hence a double analogy is introduced (294-301).25 The poet describes two hydraulic machines, the mechanisms of which are likened to that of the natural phenomenon under investigation. This passage should be considered of focal significance for our tracing down of the poem's sources of inspiration and the overall apprehension of the poet's independence from them. praecipiti deiecta sono premit unda fugatque torpentes auras pulsataque corpora denset. nam ueluti sonat ora diu Tritone canoro- pellit opus collectus aquae uictusque moueri 295 spiritus et longas emugit bucina uoces; carmineque irriguo magnis cortina theatris imparibus numerosa modis canit arte regentis, quae tenuem impellens animam subremigat unda: haud aliter summota furens torrentibus aura 300 pugnat in angusto et magnum commurmurat Aetna. Then the water from the clouds, streaming down with headlong noise, presses on the sluggish air-currents, drives them before it, and with its buffeting condenses their elements. For just as the shore echoes for long the tuneful Triton-horn - the machinery is set in motion by a volume of water and the air which is perforce moved thereby, and then the trumpet bellows forth its prolonged blare; just as in some vast theatre a water-organ, whose musical modes harmonise through their unequal pipes, sounds its water-worked music thanks to the organist's skill, which 25 We should note that according to Goodyear, Incerti auctoris Aetna (n. 1, above) 157 ad 293, there is an ambiguity as to whether the poet distinguishes between the downrush of rain and the action of torrents, presumably operating within the mountain {torrentibus).</page><page sequence="11">MYRTO GARANI: VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN AETNA 1 1 3 starts a small draught of air while causing a rowing movement in the water below - even so the wind, dislodged by the rushing streams, raves and struggles in its narrow space and Aetna murmurs loudly with the blast. In the first instance, some kind of a Triton-horn is described (294-96). This is followed by a comparison with a water-organ (297-99). As far as the former analogy is concerned, unfortunately, we do not have any evidence about the purpose and the exact structure of such an organ; it may have been a time-machine destined to announce the hour to gods or men. The structure of this hydraulic machinery is somehow strange, since it is not just air that someone blows within the horn, but this air is set in motion by water. The action of the water ( collectus aquae , 295) that presses the air in the Triton-horn (pellit , 295) is compared to that of the torrents (torrentibus, 300) upon the air-currents (premit...fugatque / pulsataque...denset , 292-93). In both the tenor and the vehicle of the simile special emphasis is placed upon the terrible noise that is produced (Aetna: praecipiti...sono , 292; Triton-horn: Tritone canoro /...longas emugit bucina voces , 294-96). In fact, the roaring sound of the horn is described by means of the metaphorical language ( emugit , 296) which is typically used to describe the roaring sound heard before an earthquake and is thus assimilated to that produced by a volcanic eruption.26 The poet's choice of a Triton-shell in the vehicle of the simile should put us on the alert. Triton was a monstrous half-man, half-fish figure, whose special attribute was a twisted conch shell on which he blew at the command of Poseidon, like a trumpet to calm and sooth the restless waves of the sea (e.g. Ov. Met. 1.332-47) or raise the waves (e.g. Verg. Aen. 10.209-14). According to Hyginus (Poet. Astronom, ii.23), in the fight of the Giants this trumpet served to frighten the enemies. Its sound was so terrible that, when loudly blown, it put the Giants to flight, who imagined it to be the roar of a mighty wild beast. Going back to the simile in question, the mythological allusion to Triton has a significant bearing on its overall interpretation. While according to the myth it was Triton who blew his hollow trumpet, our poet inverts this order. The water is not any more the passive recipient of Triton's action, but rather its initiator; it even conquers the air ( victusque , 295). This inversion has been foreshadowed since the beginning of the analogy, when the air-currents are sketched as sluggish (torpentes auras , 293), and is held till the final verse of the analogy in which the poet turns back to the image of the volcano; instead of water that elsewhere murmurs under the impact of Tritonian air (e.g. Aen. 10.214, spumea... murmur at unda ), it is now air that rages (fur ens ...aura, 300) and Aetna that murmurs (&lt; commurmurat , 301). By his choice of vehicle, the poet demystifies the sound of the volcano. The Giants, equated with the winds, are once again overcome; along with them any false mythological stories associated with their action under the volcano are demolished. 26 Sen. Nat. Quaest. VI. 13.5, Ideoque antequam terra moueatur, solet mugitus audiri, uentis in abdito tumultuantibus. Nec enim aliter posset, ut ait noster Vergilius : 'Sub pedibus mugiré solum et iuga celsa moueri. ' nisi hoc esset uentorum opus ('And so, before the earthquake a roaring noise is usually heard from winds that are creating a disturbance underground. Otherwise it could not happen - as our Virgil says: 'The ground bellows under our feet and the high ridges move' - unless this were the work of winds'). Cf. De mundo 396a, (ADiaycai. aeiajxoí, ^luīcrļļia yfjç. Cf. also Verg. Aen. 4.490, 6.256; Ov. Met. 7.206; Sen. Here. fur. 521; Oed. 173; Thy. 262; Lucan 3.418. See De Vivo, Le parole della scienza (n. 13, above) 59ff, who comments on the usage of the metaphor in Seneca and Vergil and notes that this scientific image goes back to Aristotle.</page><page sequence="12">114 BICS-52 - 2009 This process of demythologization is strengthened by means of a second analogical image that follows (297-99). The scene is transferred from outdoors within a Roman theatre and the poet describes a hydraulic organ known in Rome from Cicero's time. As Ellis describes it, 'The organ, to the eye, presented two distinct parts, a lower case or box into which the water was poured, and which contained the mechanism for making it act on the air to be conveyed to the tubes, and above it a series of bronze pipes generally ascending in gradationally adjusted lengths'.27 Now there is an agent of the sound, a gifted organist. Again the poet points to the action of water (i unda , 299) upon air {tenuem... animam, 299). The terrible noise of the volcano is compared to the melodious sound of the water-organ {numerosa, 298); this adjective, however, looks back at the image of the Cyclopes, which were sketched as forging the thunderbolt with rhythmic strokes upon the anvil {numerosa in verbera , 38). Hence, by means of this second analogy the sound of the wind is further demythologized. In the final verses of the simile, the image sketched in the first verses is picked up again: the winds are no longer sluggish {torpentes auras , 293), but metamorphosized into a raging creature {fur ens... / pugnai... commurmur at, 301). In this instance, the change from plural to singular points to the force acquired. These two analogies considered together, apart from providing an explanation about the initial motion of the volcanic winds, have gradually demythologized the sound of the volcanic eruption, first by erasing the gigantomachie implications and then by comparing it with a melodious sound. The emphasis placed on the sound heard before the eruptions may also account for the presence of Enceladus instead of the Titan Typhoeus in the prologue of the poem, given that the former's name means "loud battle cry" and suggests a fearful acoustic effect. For this choice, Vergil's Aeneid (3.570-87) plausibly has served as his model.28 This type of analogy is reminiscent of Empedoclean ones, such as the clepsydra simile (DK3 1 B84), in which the Presocratic philosopher compares the action of the wind and fire within two different containers, a lantern and a human eye, in order to extract conclusions about the structure of the latter.29 Even more to the point, the two-fold form of the simile recalls Lucretius' multi-dimensional similes which bear a very vivid Empedoclean color. To draw just one example, when Lucretius expounds plausible explanations of thunder, he compares the sound produced by the winds buffeting the cloud with the flapping or rolling sound produced when wind beats the awnings of a theatre {cf. e.g., 6.108-15).30 He then further elaborates his comparison by introducing two more vehicles (i.e. the sound of paper 6.1 12, clothes hung up to dry 6.1 14). Whereas, in Aetna the two vehicles do not have such a close interrelation as they do in Lucretius, still the poet inevitably assimilates the mechanisms of his two hydraulic machines. Water as a cause of setting air in motion occurs in other available sources as well. Epicurus in his Letter to Pythocles discusses the phenomenon of the emergence of winds 27 Ellis, Aetna (n. 1, above) 143. 28 F. Muecke, 'A (literary) voyage round Mt. Etna', Classicum 32.1 (2006) 12-23, at 18, who also remarks that the earliest evidence for Enceladus and Etna is Callimachus Aet. 1 .35ff. 29 M. R.

DRN 6.694-702). Munro quotes also a paral- lel from Justin {Epitoma Historiarum Philippicarum Pompei Trogi iv. 1 .15), according to whom 'The waters as they clash entrap air and drag it along with them to the seabed, where they keep it compressed until it seeps through the vents in the soil to ignite the combustible material within it'.33 According to this theory, the invading wave itself brings about wind and ultimately fire.34 Seneca correspondingly discusses the role of the sea for enclosing winds within earth and then causing earthquake (Nat. Quaest. 15). 35 While in all of these passages what prevails is the role of sea and breakers, a passage from Aristotle's Meteorology about the role of rain in entrapping - not generating - air within earth could perhaps offer a closer parallel to Aetna (Mete. II.7): 'Anaxagoras says that the air, whose natural motion is upwards, causes earthquakes when it is trapped in hollows beneath the earth, which happens when the upper parts of the earth get clogged by rain, all earth being naturally porous'.36 It turns out that the action of torrents as an instigator of winds within earth is not a common volcanic cause. Neither is a similar analogy found in any of our surviving sources. In fact, by his choice of contemporary examples as vehicles in his simile, the anonymous poet brings in so much of Roman colour that scholars even tried to take these images as evidence for dating the poem.37 31 A. Rostagni, 'Parentesi pseudovirgiliana: 1" Aetna", in Virgilio Minore (Roma 1961) 283-334, at 298. Rostagni 299 gleans further Epicurean elements in this passage; namely, he thinks that the reference to corpora (293) points to the atomic theory. The pressure of the air and the force of the winds is a condensation of minuscule bodies, out of which air is composed. The effects are exercised by the water, which presses the air- currents and condenses the particles. Note that the collocation collectus aquae (Aetna 295) points also back to Lucretius (e.g. DRN 4 .414, conlectus ... acquae' 6.557-58 uentus ... conlectus). 32 Bailey, Titi Lucreti Cari De rerum natura Libri Sex (n. 2, above) 1654. 33 The translation is by J.

At this point, however, the didactic poet encounters the imagined objection of his pupil (307-08). While he has referred so far to the action of the water outside earth, this didactic device makes him concede that winds may arise from other causes; hence he introduces two further explanations about causes which operate beneath the surface of earth.38 Winds may gather underground either due to the collapse of subterranean rocks and caverns which bring about a dispersion of the internal air (309-11) or due to the mists produced under the earth (312-19). The writer briefly refers to the former cause, the one based on the element of earth. Emphasis is placed again on the sound (ingenti sonitu , 310). The omission of an explanatory image may be due to the fact that his argument is related to the inner structure of the earth, which has been explained in length in an earlier passage, to which the pupil should refer. Yet, since it is quite obscure how wind may be produced from moisture, the poet adds an expounding analogy (312-18): aut umore etiam nebulas effondere largo, ut campis agrisque soient quos alluit amnis. uallibus exoriens caligai nubilus aer: ilumina parua ferunt auras, uis próxima uento est: 315 eminus adspirat fortes et uerberat umor. atque haec in uacuo si tanta potentia rorum est, hoc plura efficiant infra clusique necesse est. Again, fogs with their ample vapour pour out air, as they commonly do in plains and fields watered by a river. Rising from valleys the air makes a sombre cloud: rivulets bring gusts whose force is like the force of winds. Moisture from a distance breathes on the air-currents and whips them into strength. And, if a free space lets moisture have such power, its effects must be greater in proportion when within confined limits underground. Mists produced under the earth are compared with those we see on meadows near a river and these are said to be the originator of winds (inside: nebulas , 312; outside: nubilus aer , 314; auras , vis próxima vento , 315). In both places, the origin of the winds is said to be moisture (inside: umore... largo, 312; outside: amnis , 313, umina parva , 315, umor , 316, potentia rorum , 317). The existence of underground rivers is taken for granted (inside: infra clusique , 318), since the poet has already proved it earlier in his account by appealing to common experience (117-35). So, he describes only what we actually see outside (in vacuo , 317). He adds that there is a difference in the strength of moisture when 38 Note that Lucretius (DRN 6.680-93) states that the volcano has hollow caves beneath it which are full of air, which when agitated becomes wind, without however explaining how this mechanism is activated.</page><page sequence="15">MYRTO GARANI: VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN AETNA 1 1 7 enclosed, in a way similar to the increased force of fire and air when trapped. We should, then, assume that when these mists rise underneath, they produce breezes of considerable force. At first glance, this explanation is related to the first one expounded, since in both places clouds and cloudy wind are involved {cf. 290, nubes et nubilus Auster ); this time, however, they are placed beneath earth and are considered the windy product, not the creator of wind. As Munro remarks, these currents of air are made perceptible in a hot climate due to the difference in temperature between the air and running waters;39 although it is not explicitly stated, one is tempted to discern in this analogy the lurking presence of the element of fire - the only element missing so far from this list of explanations -, as the prime mover of the production of wind from moisture. Hence, the poet plausibly describes an unseen process similar to that of vaporization of water under the impact of fire, in the same line with Seneca who puts it forward as a possible cause of earthquakes {Nat. Quaest. VI. 1 1).40 In sum, the poet explicates four alternative causes, two operating above ground (wind, water) and two below it (earth, plausibly fire). Once again, this account is organized in line with the four elements theory. d. Behaviour of winds: The behaviour of winds within earth is described either by means of its comparison with the similar one of fire or of water - i.e. the other two mobile elements - under the same conditions, or by observing a parallel mechanism involving winds in a different environment. Similar analogies occur in all of the poem's target texts (Theophrastus, Lucretius, Seneca) and they ultimately look back at Empedocles.41 The writer compares the behaviour of winds with the similar one of fire in confined space (146-52):42 nam quo liberior quoque est animosior ignis semper in inclusis nec uentis segnior ira est, sub terra penitusque nouent hoc plura necesse est, uincla magis soluant, magis hoc obstantia pellant. nec tamen in rígidos exit contenta canales 150 uis animae flammaeue: ruit qua próxima cedunt obliquumque secat qua uisa tenerrima caula est. For as fire is always more unfettered and more furious in confined space, and as the rage of the winds is no less vehement there, so to this extent, underground and in earth's depths, must fire and wind cause greater changes, all the more loose their 39 Munro, Aetna (n. 1, above) 62. 40 Cf. Arist. Mete. II.7 365b21, 'There must be exhalation both from moist and dry, and earthquakes are a necessary result of the existence of these exhalations. For the earth is in itself dry but contains much moisture because of the rain that falls on it; with the result that when it is heated by the sun and its own internal fire, a considerable amount of wind is generated both outside it and inside' (trans. Lee). 41 For such analogies in Theophrastus and Lucretius see Garani, Empedocles redivivus (n. 30, above) 96-97. Accordingly for Seneca see Williams, 'Greco-Roman seismology' (n. 7, above). 42 According to scholars - e.g. Munro, Aetna (n. 1, above) 52; Ellis, Aetna (n. 1, above) 99; Goodyear, Incerti auctoris Aetna (n. 1, above) 135 - there is a lacuna after 142.</page><page sequence="16">118 BICS-52 - 2009 bonds, all the more drive off what blocks their course. Yet 'tis not into unyielding channels that the pent-up force of air or flame escapes. It hurtles on only where the nearest barriers give way, and cuts its course sideways just where the enclosure seems most frail. From what we know about the behaviour of the enclosed fire, we may draw inferences about the behaviour of winds when imprisoned under the earth. First the poet states that when confined, fire increases its violence; and this is also how wind reacts in earth's depths (146-49). Then, he adds that neither wind nor fire will follow a particular course, but will force a way wherever what encloses it is weakest (150-52). The action of winds is also compared with that of water.43 As soon as winds are pro- duced, their force is said to get further increased by compression (coactu / exagitant uentos : pugnant in faucibus: arte / pugnantis suffocat iter. 'By compression they rouse the winds; they strive in narrow gorges; in that close strife their channel strangles them', 319-21). Winds are then compared to waves of the sea piled up (321-26): uelut unda profundo terque quaterque exhausta graues ubi perbibit Euros, ingeminant fluctus et primos ultimus urget: haud secus, adstrictus certamine, tangitur ictu spiritus involuensque suo sibi pondere uires 325 densa per ardentes exercet corpora uenas, As when a wave drawn up again and again from the deep, has drunk full of the East Wind's violence, the billows redouble their number and the first are pushed on by the last, in that same way, the (volcanic) wind feels the impact of the struggle which compresses it, wraps its own strength within its heavy mass and impels its close-packed particles through fiery passages. One breaker comes after the other, the last crowding on the first and this is how the waves gain their strength. The first instigator of waves is violent East winds. This image of the winds' action has been prepared by a similar description earlier in the poem, when the writer claimed that the seismic activity is not generated near the shell of the earth where we see broad cavities and openings (169-71); in order to rage, winds need to encounter resistance within the channels through which they pass. The poet resumes here the idea that the condition of the winds' fury is their pressure one upon another and illuminates it further by drawing an analogy. Then, he visualizes the final outburst of winds out of the volcano by resorting to the image of many forcing pumps, by means of which water is forced upwards so as to extinguish fire (et, quacumque iter est, properat transitque morantem, / donee confluuio, ueluti siponibus actus / exsilit atque furens tota uomit igneus Aetna. 'Wherever a path is 43 Cf. in Sen. Nat. Quaest. VI. 17 the comparison of the action of enclosed air when blocked within earth with that of a river; note here the Vergilian quotation (Aen. 8.728), Tor when all the water that comes up from behind accumulates upon itself, and is not able to sustain its own weight, it acquires its force by destruction and escapes in a forward rush with those very obstacles with lay in its way. The same thing happens in the case of air' (trans. T. H. Corcoran, Seneca Naturales Quaestiones II (Cambridge MA and London, Loeb Classical Library 457 1972).</page><page sequence="17">MYRTO GARANI: VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN AETNA 1 19 found, it speeds on, ignoring any wind that would stay its course, until, driven by the confluent air-stream, as by so many forcing-pumps, it leaps forth and all over Aetna discharges itself in blasts of angry fire', 327-29).44 Winds are again compared with water, yet from a different point of view. Instead of an external agent, it is the constricted space of the channels that forces out the enclosed air-streams, as by so many forcing-pumps; due to this pressure the winds are set afire and violently hurled out of the volcano; unlike in the vehicle, the volcanic process results in generating, not quenching the fire.45 Last but not least, the action of winds beneath earth is compared to that of winds producing fire among trees in the forest (359-66): siue peregrinis igitur propriisue potentes coniurant animae causis, ille impetus ignes 360 et montis partes atra subuectat harena, uastaque concursu trepidantia saxa fragores ardentesque simul flammas ac fulmina rumpunt. haud aliter quam cum prono iacuere sub Austro aut Aquilone fremunt siluae, dant bracchia nodo 365 implicitae ac serpunt iunctis incendia ramis. Whether then it is through extraneous or internal causes that the winds make their puissant alliance, that volcanic rush carries up amid black sand streams of fire and pieces of the mountain: huge rocks shiver as they clash and burst into explosions together with blazing flames and lightning flashes; as when forests have fallen beneath the swoop of the South wind or when they moan under a Northern gale, they intertwine their arms in a knot and with the union of the branches the fire creeps on. Rocks clashing by winds are compared to anthropomorphic trees which intertwine their branches once beaten by a South or a North wind; in both cases the winds by their blasts generate flame and thunder. While the poet maintains the - typical by now - personification of winds {coniurant animae , 360), the animated woods in the second part of the simile foreshadow the image of mutilated lumps of falling rock as soldiers defeated or still fighting, that will be drawn further down, when the poet will describe them overcome by the conflagration (470-75): illinc incertae facies hominumque figurae: 470 pars lapidum domita, stanti pars robora pugnae nec recipit flammas; hinc indefessus anhelat atque aperit se hostis, decrescit spiritus illinc- haud aliter quam cum laeto deuicta tropaeo prona iacet campis acies et castra sub ipsa. 475 44 A similar analogy is also found Sen. Nat. Quaest. 11.16, where it is employed in order to illustrate the formation of a lightning bolt within clouds. 45 Sen. Nat. Quaest II.2.16; Plin. Nat. Hist. 2.66.166.</page><page sequence="18">120 BICS-52 - 2009 They present vague shapes in human likeness -some of the stones suggest the defeated warrior, some a gallant host armed for a standing fight, unassailed by the flames; on one side pants the enemy unwearied and deploys his forces, on another the breath of fury wanes, even as when an army, vanquished in the victor's joyous triumph, lies prostrate on the field right to the gates of the camp. e. Quellenforschung: Regarding the poem's sources, Goodyear claims that 'The evidence of the 'Natural Questions' demonstrates, to a fairly high degree of probability, that the 'Aetna' had at least one major source in common with Seneca, and the evidence of the 'Aetna' itself strongly suggests that an earlier writer had formed the coherent explanation of volcanic activity therein propounded.'46 Posidonius has often been thought of as one of the poem's main sources.47 However, the fact should not go unobserved that the only work - apart from Aetna - that appears to have been devoted entirely to volcanism is Theophrastus' book TI s pi pvaxoç rov èv ZiKsXía. One can deduce from the title that Theophrastus described the volcanic lava. In fact, as Goodyear suggests, Theophrastus merits reconsideration for being Aetna's major source.48 There are two instances in the poem in which the explanations are organized according to the four elements theory (102-16 on the formation of holes within earth, 282-318 on the causes of winds). This method brings to mind the similar one used by Theophrastus in his Metarsiologica , a work which has survived only in Arabic and Syriac summaries, and is published by Daiber.49 The extant summaries allow us to see that according to Theophrastus earthquakes may have several causes. Theophrastus also differentiated himself from Aristotle, by making the four elements the organizing principle for his explanations. Regarding earthquakes Kidd remarks that this method is not only totally un- Aristotelian, but also un-Posidonian: 'The critical point is that the Aristotelian/Posidonian tradition identified the division of earthquake classification by vertical/horizontal shock, Theophrastus identified his division by earth collapse/air pressure, and this throws us back again necessarily to multiple causal description by element.'50 At the same time, 46 Goodyear, 'The "Aetna"' (n. 3, above) 352. 47 Goodyear, 'The "Aetna"' (n. 3, above) 354, summarizes the similarities of Aetna with what we find in Posidonius' fragments: Posidonius wrote about Sicily (frs. 249-50 E-K) and specifically about Etna (fr. 234 E-K). In fř. 234 E-K he shows a particular interest in the liquefaction, solidifying and coloration of volcanic lava, matters which our poet too discusses at length (see 480ff., 523ff. E-K). Again Posidonius interested himself in volcanic activity elsewhere (frs. 227-28 E-K) as also in earthquakes (frs. 230-33 E-K). Like our poet, but admittedly like many others too, he considered spiritus the agent of this activity (fr. 228 E-K) as of earthquakes (fr. 12 E-K). 48 Goodyear, 'The "Aetna"' (n. 3, above) 355. 49 H.

Metars. section 15 (Daiber) on the account of the four possible causes and of different kinds of earthquakes: collapsing hollows in the earth; moving water; wind below the earth which looks for an exit; fire dissolving air which seeks more space. 50 I.

In his turn, the poet of Aetna is proved capable of writing a didactic poem which displays internal coherence and considerable originality as far as its imagery and its volcanic theory are concerned. Despite, therefore, the chaotic state of its textual tradition, the poem certainly deserves further exploration and evaluation. University of Patras, Greece 51 There is also an analogy among Posidonius' extant fragments (fř. 228 E-K = Sen. Nat.Quaest. II.26.4-7): fire arising from a moist cloud without being extinguished is compared with the rising of a volcanic island in the Aegean. 52 Seneca ascribes the statement about the method of multiple causes to Epicurus (Nat. Quaest. VI.20.5). For analogies in Epicurus and Lucretius see P. H. Schrijvers, 'Le regard sur l'invisible, in O. Gigon (ed.), Lucrèce. Huit exposés suivis de discussions ( Entretiens sur l'antiquité classique 24; Geneva 1978) 77-114; repr. in Schrijvers, Lucrèce et les Sciences de la Vie (Mnemosyne suppl. 186; Leiden 1999) 183-213; A. Schiesaro, Simulacrum et Imago (Pisa 1990); Garani, Empedocles redivivus (n. 30, above). For analogies in Seneca see M. Armisen-Marchetti, Sapientiae faciès: étude sur les images de Sénèque (Paris 1989) 283-31 1. 53 One is tempted to compare here Ovid's account of Aetna in his Metamorphoses (Met. 15.340-55). In this passage, which forms part of the mystic-philosophical-scientific account of Pythagoras, Ovid expounds three alternative causes concerning his volcanic theory that, since everything is subdued to change, one day Aetna will be extinguished (either due to changes in the structure of the perforated earth - which is like an animal -, or to loss of winds' strength, or even due to lack of nourishment for the fire). The use of multiple causations is striking. For connection of this passage with Aetna see Rostagni, 'Parentesi pseudovirgiliana' (n. 31, above) 324-26; S. Viarre 'Mythologie et philosophie à propos de l'Etna dans les Métamorphoses d'Ovide', in D. Bertrand (ed.), Figurations du volcan à la Rennaissance (Paris 2001) 25-34. For more on this passage see S. K. Myers, Ovid's causes : cosmology and aetiology in the Metamorphoses (Ann Arbor 1994) 147-19; Hardie, 'The speech of Pythagoras' (n. 15, above); K. Galinsky, 'The Speech of Pythagoras at Ovid Metamorphoses 15.75-478', PLLS 10 (1998) 313-36. Last but not least, the fact should not go unobserved that Empedocles, whose name is strongly associated since antiquity with the volcano of Aetna owing to his legendary fatal jump into it (cf. Hor. Ars P. 464-66, v. Ib. 597-98; Lucian, Dial. Mort. 6.20.4), stands behind all of Aetna's main scientific intertextual target texts (i.e. Theophrastus' Metarsiologica , Lucretius' DRN, Seneca's Nat. Quaesti cf. also Ovid's Met. 15.340-55). Therefore, one could tentatively claim that his implicit - but still catalytic - influence upon the literary means, the analogical method, and the scientific thought of Aetna 's anonymous poet is lurking - even if unconsciously - throughout.</page></plain_text>
