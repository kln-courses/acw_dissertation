<plain_text><page sequence="1">Drawing Blanks: Notes on Andy Warhol's Late Works BENJAMIN H. D. BUCHLOH 1. Anomic Drawing The metamorphoses of drawing in Warhol's oeuvre recapitulate all the radical transformations that traditional drawing was subjected to in the twentieth century: from the line that figures the hand of the author and the figure of the subject to the line that is anonymous, lifeless, and mechanical - seemingly the mere printout of a mechanical matrix, or of an optical projection (the old overhead), or the imbecile tautology of tracing an always already-given line prescribed in the design of objects. Already in some of his earliest drawings from the late 1950s, when Warhol copied covers from the so-called "purple press," specifically its advertisements for sexual services, he deployed two performative strategies that would differentiate his drawings from drawing as it had been known until then. Operating in the register of the linguistic lapsus (by slipping in spelling mistakes or mispronunciations) and in the register of the perceptual hiatus (by fragmenting contours, omitting details, and leaving empty spaces), these language lacks or spatial voids are precursors to the "blanks," as Warhol would later call his monochrome canvases when they accompa- nied his photographic paintings in order to double them up as diptychs. Both strategies, lapsing and voiding, ostentatiously identify with failures or resis- tances to comply with the rigors of the symbolic order (of speaking, writing, and drawing). Here, deskilling appears either as a handicap or as a subversion, as an authorial admission of ineptness or as a declaration of solidarity with a subject deprived of competences (e.g., spelling, enunciation, accurate depiction, and visual and spatial coordination). The two primary sources of citation are simultaneously the targets of address: one being the language deficits of class (from fear or inhibi- tion); the other, the loss of linguistic competence under duress (from desire or angst). Both are combined to tout a primitivism of psychic formations (as opposed to modernism's earlier primitivisms of geopolitical differences). The intertwinement of * A version of this essay first appeared in Andy Warhol: Shadows and Other Signs of Life (Cologne: Walther Konig, 2007), published on the occasion of an exhibition of the same name at the Chantal Crousel Gallery, Paris.

This emphatic assault on skills situates Warhol's early drawings in a some- what unexpected proximity to seemingly unrelated phenomena: on the one hand, to the artificial infantilisms of Dubuffet's Art Brut; on the other, to Cy Twombly's mobilization of the graffito as a graphic voiceover to his post-automatist drawings of the late 1950s. A grasp for remnants of authenticity outside of culture as much as outside of industry, drawing's manifest deskilling is a desperate search for graphemes neither originating in artistic technique nor destined for an instant recuperation by industrial design. Warhol's early drawings hover in an increas- ingly narrow and ultimately vanishing space between these two spheres (before they collapse into each other entirely). Making these confrontations all the more pertinent - between the newspaper or magazine cover as a linguistic and iconic matrix and the imaginary reader's defi- cient response - is Warhol's mobilization of the lacuna, of blockage, of silence as a formal device. But in spite of appearances of similarity, Warhol's subsequent mono- chrome blanks are fundamentally different from all previous modernist expurgations of figure, form, and color relations. If these had defined the mono- chrome as a feat of self-reflexivity and perceptual purity, a triumph of the subject's emancipation from myth, Warhol's "blanks" articulate withdrawals and failures, the subject's (and drawing's and painting's) withering away under the pressures of an overpowering mass-cultural apparatus. And since they underline the inextricable links between aesthetic disarticulations and social and psychosexual pathologies, their silences are closer to those of Samuel Beckett than those of John Cage. 2. Ben Shahn Since the drawings of Ben Shahn served as the primer for Warhol's drawing lessons, it is worthwhile to look back for a moment at Shahn 's historical significance. Caricature and cartoon were clearly among the original references for Shahn 's con- ception of linear design. Both had continued to presume a producing subject that would conceive and execute the drawing as much as they had incorporated a view- ing subject to be addressed in an iconic and somatic encounter. Shahn 's line had a communicative function: depicting, embodying, narrating. His lines situated the perceiving subject in a social space, not the space of totalized objects. 3. Copies {Commercial) Ironically, it is Warhol the commercial artist who remained attached to the obsolete models of communicative drawing that Shahn had deployed. At the very moment that Warhol decided to become a "fine" artist, he discarded these traditional models and replaced them with a rather different one that we will call</page><page sequence="3">Andy Warhol.

This approach positions drawing in a manifestly external dependence on preexisting schemata. It defines drawing as operating totally out- side of the range of what was once artistic invention, and it negates drawing as a means of tracing authorial will and signaling bodily self-constitution. Warhol's matrices of the medium can appear in multiple guises and assume very diverse formats. Their iconic rigor (and rigidity) can derive from the mere copying of commercial signs, just as their indexical emphasis (and empathy) can be drafted from tracing the shadows of things, or from the immediacy of shadows alone. 4. Copies (Classical) Drawing according to preexisting external schemata had haunted the twenti- eth century since Cubism. This threatening menace of the medium's mechanicity would never disappear, and accordingly there were many attempts to recover the sup- posedly organic origins of drawing in bodily mimesis. In the 1930s, one of the most important recovery attempts tried to draw on supposedly transhistorical resources outside of or prior to mechanization and industrialization. Artists during that period, lead by Picasso and Matisse, claimed an alternate pool of drawing's origins, and they declared a lineage that mobilized the seemingly timeless neoclassical Mediterranean tradition.</page><page sequence="5">Drawing Blanks 7 Warhol. Knitting. 1977. 5. Man Ray versus Matisse However, unlike the retour a Vordre of the Picasso and Matisse of the 1930s, with their ostentatious attempts to reconstitute drawing within the traditions of neoclassical embodiment, an artist like Man Ray (or Francis Picabia) deliberately travestied the project of establishing a neoclassical foundation of drawing. Man Ray's sublime perversions - his attempts at synthesizing, or, rather, hybridizing, the technical and the neoclassical traditions and at suspending drawing in this duality - acknowledged early on that neither radical mechanicity nor a return to organicity could sustain drawing much longer. Man Ray's drawings signaled to Warhol that the hand was exhausted and that the machine would be a domineering and deadening matrix. Thus the Warhol of the early 1960s indisputably became a Cassandra, proph- esying the end of drawing. And Warhol knew early on that to disembody the line had more radical implications than just the deadening anesthesia of the hand: it de- privileged the maker and de-mythified art-making once and for all. 6. Picasso's Knitting Model Warhol's peculiar drawings of hands knitting from 1977 seem to refer us directly back to his precursors from that moment of crisis in the 1930s. In an etch- ing for Balzac's The Unknown Masterpiece, published by Vollard in 1931, Picasso depicts a male artist, who is drawing a large abstract geometric structure in space,</page><page sequence="6">8 OCTOBER Warhol. Knitting. 1977. being confronted by a female model as she knits and contemplates the artist's abstraction. Warhol's feminine knitting hand counteracts the claim that it is only in virile drawing that the passage of time and the processes of spatial demarcation can be articulated. But Warhol's drawings of knitting hands were probably also inspired by the perpetual knitting activity of his lifelong friend Brigid Polk, who served in the role of extravagant Cerberus and eccentric receptionist at the Factory, inspecting and (disapproving of) visitors and spectators while barely looking up from her feminine handicrafts. What is most important, however, is the manifest counter-gendering that Warhol performs here on the oldest technique of representation: drawing is aligned with knitting as its analog and equal (as opposed to Picasso's strict gender- divide between the artist who draws magisterially and the model who knits subserviently). The complex spatiotemporal act of knitting suddenly appears as not all that different from other mark-making processes in time. This act of counter-gendering, or what we could also call the demasculinization of drawing, has also been per- formed since the early 1960s in the drawings of Hanne Darboven. It is not an accident that her repetitive rhythmic definition of drawing as writing and as a mere</page><page sequence="7">Drawing Blanks 9 Warhol. Knitting. 1977. marker of spatiotemporal expansion has acquired a linear morphology similar to that of the mark-making process of knitting. 7. Sewing and Stitching the Picture Warhol's perpetual return to obsolete or quaint procedures and techniques gave birth to yet another particularly troubling hybrid that counteracted gen- dered conventions of image production: the sewn photograph. When first confronted with the peculiar photographic structure of a group of identical images sewn together, the most surprising fact is undoubtedly that it seems per- fectly natural to have photographs sewn together, no matter how much one would have been unable to imagine such a thing up until the moment of first encounter with Warhol's utterly abstruse operation. Once again, there is first of all sewing's nature as a manual, low-level artisanal activity, clearly gendered as feminine and domestic. Yet it perplexes us when applied to the technological image and the image technology that had governed modern mass culture with a universal power only to be displaced by television in the 1950s. Thus, we witness an allegorization of the gendered nature of photographic technology by a trib- ute to domestic labor, and a reduction of the claims of the photograph's</page><page sequence="8">10 OCTOBER Warhol Going Out of Business. 1984-86. absolutely pure indexical authenticity by a relapse into an even more primitive corporeal indexicality: the stitch. 8. Space Fruit Space Fruit is the title of a series of drawings Warhol produced in the late 1980s. They appear fragmented at first, incomplete, as though they were rem- nants of a project that had not come to fruition. Strange fruit, indeed, since they are as far from a still life as industrially-produced fruit is from fruit. They seem to merely record the fragmentary outlines of the formerly common presence of the natural among the objects of everyday life. Since they are evidently the result of an overhead projection, executed only with the slightest commitment to accuracy in terms of description, they appear as so many spatial markers, fragments of out- lines, defying volume and fullness. Their curvatures bleed into space to defy their presence as volumetric illusions, as much as their plenitude of natural objects is inaccessible to the touch. It is impossible to distinguish their blending with space</page><page sequence="9">Drawing Blanks 1 1 Warhol. Space Fruit: Still Lifes (Cantaloupes II). 1979. from the bleeding of form into its surroundings, which seem to devour the con- tours of the illusion of fruit voraciously. 9. Voids and Shadows Warhol's ability to empty out visual plenitude, or to void the fullness of form, has its spatial and optical counterpart in his fascination with shadows. The shadow is self-generated by light and matter, a parthenogenesis of form, the utter opposite of the manmade, even of the readymade. Who authorizes the shadow? Like obso- lescence, the shadow is also an index of temporality and passing time. Since the shadow has no material substance of its own, it will disappear when its light source fades or when its projecting object is shifted. Thus shadows are not just metaphysi- cal readymades par excellence, they are also the sublime antidote to an aesthetic of the readymade itself, just as Duchamp himself would have wanted it. As he sug- gested, the readymade should disappear once it had been established as a new aesthetic category and as a convention of artistic production. Thus, Warhol's shadows also execute that aspect of the Duchampian legacy.</page><page sequence="10">12 OCTOBER 10. Shadows and Skulls As in Duchamp's Tu m' (1918), Warhol's shadows not only expand the indexi- cal sampling of the readymade (or rather, point to the shadow's shared condition with the readymade's origin in deixis), but they also increase the temporal tension between readymade objects and their shadows. While the objects emphatically assert their presence, their shadows announce, in the classical manner of the still life's memento mori, their imminent disappearance (an aspect that is of course made most explicit in the lapidary, yet all the more powerful, photograph of the skull and its shadows). 11. Hammer and Sickle This is played through with almost musical pleasure in Warhol's numerous photographic variations on the theme of hammer and sickle. These two arcane tools had once been the emblems of the Utopian fusion of industrial and agricul- tural labor and had been adopted by the Soviet Union in 1923 to signal the goals of Socialism. Subsequently, various combinations had adorned the flags of other nations ruled by their respective Communist parties. Yet in his representation of one of the most powerful political emblems of the twentieth century, Warhol performs a breathtaking inversion, turning the image from one of ideological sign exchange value to one of pure use value: the powerful political signs of hammer and sickle appear here as functional tools from an era of pre-industrial artisanal or rural labor. They have become almost quaint Americana, identifiable by their inscription, "Champion No. 15," as having been produced by the oldest American hardware manufacturer, "True Temper" (established in 1808). 12. Mass Magnetism The selection of this emblem is less astonishing if one remembers that one of Warhol's lifelong preoccupations was the question, never posed explicitly but always latent in every image he conceived, of what it actually took for an object or an image to acquire mass magnetism. That question of the mass-media aura had been posed by Warhol both in terms of his iconography (e.g., Elvis, Marilyn, Jackie) as well as in many provocative statements in which he explicitly fused the living conditions of totalitarian state culture with the icons of Western capitalist consumer culture (e.g., Coca Cola, McDonald's). Most famously, perhaps, Warhol bemoaned in an interview that (at the time) "Moscow and Peking did not yet have something beautiful, like McDonald's ..." and assured us in various statements (possibly in all earnestness, possibly not) that the consumption of Coca Cola and of McDonald's signaled the peaceful achievement of socialism in the Western world through non-revolutionary means, since it allowed everybody to consume the same objects.</page><page sequence="11">Drawing Blanks 1 3 Warhol. Hammer and Sickle, c. 1976-77. Warhol's work sang the swansong of a fundamental dialectic of the avant- garde in the twentieth century: between an artistic culture with its discursive conventions, genres, and institutional spaces, and the incessantly expanding and encroaching forms of proto-totalitarian consumption. Any such differentiation between the production and perception of an artistic object and an object of industrial consumption could not be maintained any longer (a condition obvi- ously celebrated by Warhol's children, Koons and Murakami). 13. Hammer and Pizza Warhol's series of photographs are clearly related to the moment of the Hammer and Sickle paintings and prints from 1976-77. Yet it is not clear whether these photographic still lifes are part of the preliminary setups from which the paintings and the screen prints were drawn, or whether they redeploy the constel- lation of hammer and sickle out of sheer delight at staging a confrontation with a totally different kind of object, one whose company those emblems could have never been envisioned as sharing. At least four photographs literally articulate Warhol's perpetual preoccupation</page><page sequence="12">14 OCTOBER Warhol. Hammer and Sickle, c. 1976-77. with the powerful signals of political difference under seemingly comparable con- ditions of collective experience. In one image, he slips a slice of pizza onto the stage where hammer and sickle stand in a seemingly casual embrace (accompanied by their play of multiple shadows), with the blade of the sickle somewhat lasciviously slung around the hammer's standing handle. A minuscule triangular shadow, almost like a frag- ment, broken off from the wedge of pizza, is inserted in the spatial intersection between table and wall where the theater of shadows occurs, adding its minute formal repetition to the pizza's own shadowy triangulation. In a second image, the emblems are confronted with the cardboard cubicle of a McDonald's Big Mac carton. Opened and emptied, the box aggressively gapes at the emblems, which seem almost passive, if not defeated, in this particular con- stellation. The sickle is resting on the back of its blade, casting a shadow that turns it into a bow or a primitive instrument. The blade's singular perforated dot gives it an ocular hole, projecting a second eye onto the shadow, thus making the bow or instrument suddenly appear like a primitive mask. The hammer, by contrast, lies flat and occupies center stage, its gleaming head directed at the spectator, yet pro- . jecting an arrow-like shadow aggressively towards the gaping box.</page><page sequence="13">Drawing Blanks 1 5 Vera Mukhina. Worker and Kolkhoz Woman. 1937. 14. Hammer and Dildo These objects and their shadows perform and alternate their gendered iden- tities like actors in a Kabuki theater. If there is any doubt that various plays are performed simultaneously on Warhol's object stage, then the next two images in the series give proof of yet another - that between the uncanny obsolescence of ideological investment and the penetrating presence of objects of libidinal desire. In the first of the two images, a luminous yet easily overlooked translucent object has taken the frontal position, close to center stage. It is a glistening plastic husk, unidentifiable, yet unmistakably alluding to - if not part of - the dildo family. It casts a long shadow towards the sickle's sinuous open blade, which is posed this time in a hovering position with its sharp tip pointing down like a beak, while its hammer companion is removed to the right hand side of the stage, as if exiting the show. By positioning the two elements in a continuous permutation - almost as if in a gram- matical declension - the gendered identity of these heroic icons, heretofore hidden, surfaces at last.1 1. The intensity with which these emblems were gendered in their original deployment is particularly evident in many images from the period of Socialist Realism in the Soviet Union, most monumentally (and most grotesquely) in Vera Mukhina's gigantic sculpture for Boris Iofan's Soviet Pavilion for the Paris</page><page sequence="14">16 OCTOBER 15. Sickle and Pump Almost as if in grammatical contrast to the dildo, we encounter a single lady's pump confronting the hammer and sickle couple in the last of these images. Worlds collide here once more: first, the world of a mythic, or rather mythified, proletarian past, defined by the emblems of collective subjection to production. Set against the elegant urbanity of the shoe, we finally recognize that the emblem of hammer and sickle itself had already been defined by a peculiar primitivity. It celebrated the manual operation of industrial labor and agriculture at the very moment in 1923 when the revolutionary Soviet Union was battling to achieve the quickest large-scale industrialization and agricultural collectivization the world had ever seen. In the juxtaposition of the emblems with the lady's pump (no less astonish- ing than Lautreamont's pro to-Surrealist vision of a future theater of objects in chance encounters), the shoe not only represents an era of manufacturing and consumption different from that celebrated in the pre-industrial emblems of phys- ical labor, it also opposes the arcane emblems of a universal condition of production with a concretely gendered object of the daily economy of desire. Yet in Warhol's hands, even the sickle now acquires a heretofore unimagin- able seduction. Echoing the curves of the shoe in the serpentine orientation of its sinuous blade, the sickle is now bending down towards the shoe as if in a moment of cultic veneration. With almost childlike candor, Warhol seems to ask the question of why the shoe - in spite of its universal usage, function, and appeal - failed to acquire the status of an emblem comparable to those of totalitarian Socialism. And if Warhol drains meaning out of the great emblems of the twentieth century by juxtaposing them with the common objects of consumption, he succeeds at making the bot- tomless vacuity of the objects of capitalist consumption even more vacuous. It becomes manifest, in fact, for better or for worse, that the fetish, in spite of its universal powers, will never have any horizon of meaning and signification compa- rable to those signs of voluntary or enforced collective ideological identification and their historical aspirations.2 16. Anomic Objects That particular condition of barren objects, meaningless and death-devoted, World Fair of 1937. In Mukhina's sculpture, Worker and Kolkhoz Woman, it is of course the monstrously het- erosexist image of voluptuous female fecundity that carries the sickle, as opposed to her male counterpart, the industrial worker who holds the hammer up high. 2. While highly speculative, I would venture to add one additional facet: that the homeland of Warhol's beloved mother, still called Czechoslovakia during the 1970s when Warhol pondered the meaning and significance of these emblems, was still under the rule of a Soviet satellite regime after the failed Prague Spring of 1968.</page><page sequence="15">Drawing Blanks 1 7 Warhol. Hammer and Sickle, c. 1976-77. acquires an almost monumental quality in a series of images that Warhol clearly composed and photographed at the same time as the Hammer and Sickle series. Rather than contemplating the power of emblems, however, now Warhol con- structs mere combinations of motley objects, discombobulated in their aleatory constellation, without and outside of any apparent context. Some of them could be classified at best as belonging to the everyday life at Warhol's Factory: the Polaroid camera (a particularly outdated model at that), a pair of dumbbells (Andy's workout tools?), a tape recorder (is it the tape recorder with which Andy recorded his endless telephone conversations for his books?), two different pencil sharpeners, a coat-hanger, and, in one of the images, a slightly beaten up copy of Warhol's own major intellectual testament, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again), published in 1975. Then there is a second group of objects, slightly harder to imagine encoun- tering during a normal day at the Factory: a toy handgun (an apotropaic object to ward off future attacks by the likes of Valerie Solanas?), a nondescript vessel or vase half-filled with water, a kitchen whisk (of the type that had already been pho- tographically emblazoned by Man Ray in 1920 as "He," or alternately as "She," which would certainlv have been known and verv attractive to Warhol for its</page><page sequence="16">18 OCTOBER Warhol Still Life. c. 1976. androgynous virtues alone), and, in one image, a rather prominently displayed Black Flag exterminator's pump. The image displaying the Black Flag sprayer oddly enough also features a pear, which seems to be organic rather than plastic (and there is also an odd apple in one other image of this series combining the coat-hanger with the dumbbells). The fruit intervenes in these random object encounters as if to remind the spectator (if not the author himself) that we are in fact contemplating the fate of the still-life genre under the conditions of the most advanced commodity produc- tion, where no object means anything more or less than any other one. The constellations of Warhol's natures mortes appear here as in a thrift-shop window, where all objects are defined by their minimal values of exchange and equiva- lence. As it seems, the traditional memento mori function of the still-life genre is therefore for Warhol best achieved by foregrounding the very fact of this universal anomie and vacuity of objects. 17. Readymade Drawing A drawing made by Warhol after the Black Flag still life, dated 1975, brings</page><page sequence="17">Drawing Blanks 1 9 Warhol. Still Life. c. 1975. us back to our initial question: with what type of drawing are we confronted in Warhol's magisterial oeuvre as a draftsman? We might now venture a bit further and recognize that it was ultimately neither Shahn nor Picasso, neither Matisse nor Man Ray, who could have fully anticipated the dramatic changes that would occur in the field of drawing in American art of the postwar period. Warhol's seemingly haphazard, yet meticulous, copy of the Black Flag still life (and its shad- ows) asks for a different genealogy of drawing altogether, one that acknowledges, first of all, that drawing as an art, like painting, was fundamentally transfigured, if not dislodged, by the conception of the readymade. Whatever forms of subjective and social agency drawing might have promised in the first half of the twentieth century (agency of the virtuoso subject, of the con- scious social observer and commentator, of the construction of visionary spatial delimitations, et cetera) were steadily evacuated with the arrival of the new ethos of drawing formulated by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Cy Twombly in the mid- to late 1950s. And it is clearly to them - to their articulation of the increasingly minimal options remaining open to the hand and to the notion of a subjective agency - that Warhol's drawings would turn in the early 1960s.</page><page sequence="18">20 OCTOBER One of the greatest epistemological shifts inherent in the activities of Johns, Rauschenberg, and Twombly was to simulate the death of the subject in the very site and within the very practice that had traditionally anchored and promised subjectivity in the field of the visual (at least outside of the field of language), a feat that they accomplished by means of a systematic evacuation of the grapheme. The spectrum of this evacuation ranged from Jasper Johns's drawings of the mid-1950s to Rauschenberg's drawings for his series Dante's Inferno (1958-61). Johns's work reduced drawing's spatial expanse and mobility, confining it to the minuscule spaces and operations performed by the hand and the graphite or pencil within the parameters of process and the readymade iconic matrix alone (e.g., the target or the flag). Rauschenberg's drawings appeared to be gestural acts of almost simian idiocy designed to achieve a mere mimicry of the found photograph. Warhol's copies of the commodity objects and still lifes follow suit. It is in his inimitable fusion of apparent indifference, his definition of deskilling as sublime nonchalance, and his casual slippage that the mastery of the death of the subject in and of drawing is accomplished. Such slippages occur in the Black Flag still life, and they shall serve as exemplary evidence. In spite of the drawing's seeming tautological inanity and programmatic vacuity, which declare its solidarity with an anomic world of objects as the only available rep- resentation of reality, its seemingly closed system of vacuous objects is perforated in a variety of places in the manner of a punctum of drawing: in the light reflex on the pear that suddenly acquires sensuous anthropomorphic fea- tures, or in the lovingly spelled out word "sprayer" that adorns even the pump of extinction. 18. The Stencil Paintings Stenciling ornaments on paper surfaces as Warhol does in his Stencil Paintings (which have certainly been overlooked in the formation of the Warhol canon) conveys a quaintness of function, process, and space that at first glance seems fundamentally incompatible with the rest of his oeuvre. After all, Warhol's paintings had been scandalous because of their iconography of media culture as much as for their apparent subversion of traditional painting by the technology of the silkscreen. In a typical gesture that combines the obsolete with the (seemingly) radi- cally innovative, Warhol's Stencil Paintings are airbrushed through simple abstract geometric paper stencils that could have been made by schoolchildren in their art classes. If stencils call forth the primary pleasures of infantile mark- making and decoration, be it that of the schoolchild or of folkloric Americana, they inevitably also recall the Eastern European origins of Warhol's family, inso- far as they invoke the poverty of means with which families like his had to</page><page sequence="19">Drawing Blanks 21 Warhol. Abstract Stenciled Image, c. 1960. adorn their impoverished lives. At the same time, Warhol's stencils perform a public recoding of the mythical claims that had been associated with air- brushed stencils from Man Ray to David Smith: that they enacted forms of pigment distribution in an anti-aesthetic of the mechanomorph, heroically deskilling and disfiguring the artist's hand. The stencils operate in a similarly lapidary manner on the question of composition, or rather, of non-compositionality, a strategy that had gained increasing pertinence with the introduction of symmetrical figures in the work of Jasper Johns and Frank Stella beginning in the late 1950s. Mapping the folded paper-figure as a symmetrical ornament onto the painting's or drawing's surface corresponds spatially and compositionally to the peculiarly quaint oper- ation of the stenciling/airbrushing process that Warhol deployed in order to produce these anti-paintings. Paradoxically, they draw their subversive poten- tial not out of an alliance with the machinic, but from their ability to gently relativize the heroic claims of the machine aesthetic and make them appear as already antiquated acts, almost as the modernist folk cultures of a recent past.</page><page sequence="20">Warhol Piss Painting. 1978.</page><page sequence="21">Drawing Blanks 23 19. Urochromes3 Urinating onto a canvas (or paper) is not only an act of public defilement, the violation of a once sacred and virginal space (in that sense, operating like graffiti), it is also an ostentatiously polemical gesture of defiance of the demand for painting as artistic production. By contrast, painting as spilling is waste, and inas- much as the process of staining is removed from manual control by gravity and chance, it defies the economies of order and measure warranted by a well-crafted artistic object. Of course, one wonders at what historical moment such subversive acts of painterly counter-production could have emerged. Was it with Marcel Duchamp's 3 Standard Stoppages in 1913, or with Jackson Pollock's splashing and dripping of paint in 1947, that this defiance of painting as production first mani- fested itself? Were these the major references for Andy Warhol's first Piss Paintings, initiated later, in 1962? In order to expand the historical scope of Warhol's ostensibly eccentric project, it seems necessary to point to a few more phenomena, emerging simul- taneously or slightly later. These situate Warhol's work in fact at the center of, rather than "eccentric" to, avant-garde positions of the late 1950s and early '60s. The susceptibility of Pollock's allover drip technique to a variety of mythi- fying forms of reception - the spectacularization of painting itself - would bring about several responses: one of them was Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage's collaboration on Automobile Tire Print in 1953. Renewing the emphasis on the desublimatory effect of pictorial horizontality, Tire Print also repositioned Pollock's automatist legacy within a deadpan and mechanical foundation, dis- tancing it from Pollock's bodily and expressive gyrations. Inking the tire and tracing its tracks, however, were gestures that were still a far cry from Warhol's bodily discharges that would demarcate the crisis of the indexical mark in the early 1960s. Perhaps it would be more precise to recognize that the change from Pollock's post-automatist mechanical distribution of paint to Warhol's purely per- formative distribution of bodily matter demarcated the historical transition from an economy of production to one of consumption and waste. The allover paintings by Pollock still aspired to the revelation of a unique and sublimated self in acts of seemingly liberating excess. Warhol's piss perfor- mances, by contrast, articulate a merely somatic, anonymous existence (as was the case with the shadow) since the "author" of these "gestures" and "inscrip- tions" remains anonymous. Pollock's painterly spills had continued to trace the once seemingly inex- tricable interdependence between the hand and the mark, between subjective 3.

Warhol's Oxidations (as the Piss Paintings were later baptized, to make them less obscene and offensive) are not only flowing out of the bodies of anonymous participants, but they are also the mere recordings of a chemical process, bordering on, or paralleling, the condition of photography itself (the oxidation of gold and copper particles contained in metallic paint by urethral acidity).</page></plain_text>
