Franz Rosenzweig would have been pleased with this superbly edited 100th birthday symposium. The twelve articles rigorously present his thought but are not distant. They tend to speak to Rosenzweig-the German-Jewish philosopher of existence and dialogue, master educator, and saint-as they critically clarify his difficult system. The contributors, who center around Jerusalem, Boston, and Germany, include members of his circle and their students; the themes interact in productive ways. Nathan Rothenstreich stresses the irreducable ontology of Rosenzweig's three constituent elements of existence: God's transcendence that denies expression; the world's independence even from thought; and the individual I's ephemeral nature, which death discloses, separating him from universal man. Thus, God's self-enclosure that signifies revelation "is not a continuity of the essence of God" (p. 72); in the same way man's meta (read "outside")-ethical position means that "the individual's position is given in the first place and is not an outcome of a human act or performance" (p. 83). These entities are discovered only as they relate to each other. Gershom Scholem understands this to be Rosenzweig's recovery of the doctrine of mira- cles and quotes his understanding of the bridging of the three "wholenesses": "But in reality ... we bridge this distinctness. Every attempt of ours is an attempt at such bridging. We try to attain God and He is hidden, man and he is closed, the world and it is an open riddle. Only in their interrelationships, only in Creation, Revelation and Redemption, do they open up" (p. 36). Those interrelationships occcur within the world of living reality through ordinary speech, the "inner logic." Nahum Glatzer explicates how language allows Rosenzweig's man to dis- cover himself as human, first, through the dialogue with God and then with his fellow. Language is love initiated by God and responded to by man. Moshe Idel sees all this as indicating a kabbalistic influence on a self- proclaimed antimystic. The essence of love then is "the reciprocal relationship between the unification of God and man and of man by God" (p. 164), most prominently expressed in the Shema. Man both models and effects unity through the commandments that return holy sparks dispersed in the world to God-rendering Redemption-that is, a Redemp- tion that is a future reality parallel to Lurianic Tikkun (ultimate restoral). Idel understands this limited acceptance of anthropomorphism as a description of the human-divine encounter and the human need for God as the ultimate standard as Rosenzweig's desire for "what he formerly sought in Christianity" (p. 171). For Alexander Altmann this closeness to God explains Rosenzweig's position- ing of Israel outside of history, at eternity, and within the Kingdom, as an exis- tential category of reality. Christianity remains within the world as a missionary, dependent on Israel, which provides history, in Paul Mendes-Flohr's apt descrip- tion with "an extra-historical reference" necessary in order "to realize its escha- tological destiny" (p. 155). A lacuna in this volume is an exploration of Rosenzweig's growing understand- ing of Halakhah as a system that bridges the "wholeness" of God, the world, and man. Nonetheless, this volume is now the standard and enlightening companion to reading Rosenzweig. DANIEL LANDES, Yeshiva University, Los Angeles. 666</page></plain_text>
