Having established a significant if sometimes recessive presence in Western theism, negative theology is again an important element in contemporary philosophical theology. While Anglo- American philosophy of religion remains dominated by analytic neoscholasti- cism,l in the last decade a countercurrent has emerged that makes common cause with the apophatic tradition. The Gifford lectures of Stephen R. L. Clark2 are examples of this development, as are the works of Leszek Kolakowski.3 Each thinker has attempted to expand discussion beyond the scholastic parameters of the field and make connections with important historical figures who are often neglected in the literature. Neoplatonism has featured prominently this development; as the principal philosophical foundation for apophatic theology in the West, it has been invoked in both its original Greco-Roman guise and its subsequent manifestation within the Abrahamic tradition (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). lFor example, Alvin Plantinga of Notre Dame or Richard Swinbune of Oxford. 2Stephen R.

Armstrong, the eminent authority on Plotinus and Neoplatonism. His many studies have forcefully and cogently articulated Neoplatonism's philosophical foundations and reli- gious resources.4 Indeed, his essays constitute a type of historical theology, that is, they are theological reflections that emerge from historical study. This article will examine Armstrong's apophatic theology and consider some of its implications for contemporary religious thought. The first part of the article reviews his theological views with reference to their historical back- ground in ancient Platonism and Christian Platonism. The second part then discusses some aspects of negative theology that have been made especially salient by Armstrong's sustained reflections over several decades. g Axmstong's Theological views It is tempting to think of Hilary Armstrong as a contemporary Cam- bridge Platonist, given his academic origins at that university. In the intro- duction to his most recent collection of essays, Armstrong locates himself in such terms, suggesting that the liberal Christian Platonism of his Cam- bridge days was his "true personal tradition or paradosis."5 He reacted against this tradition, however, and adopted Roman Catholicism, "a more conservative form of Christianity,"6 only to return to latitudinarian Angli- canism in the 1980s. This religious development is significant for under- standing Armstrong's views on negative theology; his historical studies often evince a personal dynamism, with the result that these essays have the quality of first-order theology. For Armstrong, negative theology is far more than a puzzling emblem of antique theology; it is the foundation of serious reflection about the divine. He understands negative theology as consisting "in a critical negation of all affirmations which one can make about God, followed by an equally criti- cal negation of our negations."7 In his words, "without the negative theol- 4A.

The true object of religious devotion and theological attention is not contained in the formulas of its representation, however authoritative or conceptually exact; rather it exceeds all finite capacity for conceptual similitude. This "escape of the One" is the central spiritual motion in Armstrong's theology.9 Nega- tive theology establishes a spiritual disquietude which calls the soul forth into further and unceasing searches for the divine. It subverts our deep human tendeney to settle for idols, reminding us that all theology can function properly only as an icon of the divine, leading the spiritual self into the immediacy of God.lÂ° Thus, apophasis saves us from idolatry, that is, from exaggerated love of those graven images of the human spiritual imagination. By serving as an antidote to dogmatism,ll the apophatic mode of reflection retains for philosophical theology a religious dimension, reas- serting its ancient role as a spiritual exercisel2 and disabusing any pretense that it exists as a disciplinary end in itself. This is "the critical value of negative theology.''l3 The most striking aspect of Armstrong's interpretation of negative theol- ogy is his association of the classical apophatic tradition with moderate skepticism. Although he admits that this connection is interpretive and not explicit in the ancient sources, he views it as a significant, tacit dimension of ancient Neoplatonic theology: If one pushed the critical mysticism of Plotinus rather further than he would be willing to go himself, it might come to consort very well with another kind of Platonism of which the Neoplatonists and their immediate predecessors strongly disapproved, the ultra-Socratic Platonism of the Skeptical Academy. It is possible that under the in- contrasted with affirmative or kataphatic theology (kataphasis means affirmation). 8A. H.

It was rather a process of training, an exercise aiming at total self-transformation, at final enlightenment and liberation." 13Armstrong found this theme in the work of Jean Trouillard, the great French Catholic scholar of Neoplatonism; in particular see Jean Trouillard, "Valeur critique de la mystique plotinienne," Revue philosophique de Louvain 59 (1961) 431-44.

It is also disquieting, since it involves the negation of our customary concep- tions about the divine. This process of denial is not enough, however, since one cannot simply settle for inverted theology either. Real negative theol- ogy would be equally ill at ease with a catechism of theological privatives. This "negation of negations" makes apophatic theology an odd, paradoxical program, teetering on the brink of nonsense. Armstrong has underscored the difficulties involved: If one does not find doing negative theology a fairly agonizing busi- ness, one is not really doing negative theology at all.... Doing negative theology is painful because, for anyone brought up in the Hellenic tradition of dogmatic philosophy, it involves an uprooting of one's whole thought, a radical criticism of the assumptions on which our philosophical talk and thinking are based.l5 This radical criticism is nonetheless not a complete, Pyrrhonian skepti- cism. It remains part of a religious program directed toward an inchoate divine goal, the direction of which one can still dimly discern. This basic vectorial sense prevents a collapse into what Armstrong has called "black mysticism,''l6 the feeling that any theological fantasy may be entertained. Neoplatonists are only enabled to resist this temptation by their obsti- nate conviction, in spite of all their negations, that the God who is driving them onwards himself is only not the Good because he is better than the Good, the source and cause of all good. The name "Good" is for them a kind of direction-finder, like the mihrab in the wall of a mosque. Their sense of direction is something given in the original awareness which propels or invites them to engage in negative theology. 17 This resolute theological skepticism, when combined with a pragmatic sense of religious direction, presents Neoplatonic thought as somewhat of a return to Socraticism. Constant questioning of religious claims is itself viewed as a form of spirituality. When the "negation of negations" is per- formed, negative theology moves beyond mere theological skepticism. Content with neither an affirmative representation of God nor the negative 14Armstrong, "Negative Theology," 185; compare idem, "The Hidden and the Open in Hellenic Thought," in idem, Hellenic and Christian Studies, no. 5 ( 1987) 81-1 17.

Ibid., 185. 7Ibid.</page><page sequence="5">JOHN PETER KENNEY 443 image that results from stripping away theological predication, the true negative theology presses on to a negation of these negations, thus avoiding a "blank little pseudo-concept of God which signifies nothing.''l8 This pro- cess becomes for Armstrong a spiritual exercise, a theological act rather than a piece of speculation: We must not be content to say that God is not anything. We must not only say, but experience and be aware, that he is not not anything either. If we go the whole way like this, we may experience a great liberation of mind, a freedom from language and concepts which will enable us to use them properly, in the endlessly critical way which I have indicated. We become, however dimly, aware, beyond our dis- tinctions and definitions, positive and negative, not of an abstract, contentless monadic simplicity which the pagan Neoplatonists are of- ten mistakenly thought to believe in but of an unspeakably rich and vivifying reality.l9 The result of negative theology is not mystical experience as such, but the combination of a firmly critical sensibility, recalcitrant to all theological dogmatism, with a strengthened awareness of divine presence. The moder- ate skepticism of genuine apophatic theology and its resultant antidogmatism are both reasons for resistance to it in some theological circles. Neoplatonism is "a very subversive philosophy," with the result that "it is dangerous to the stability of philosophical and ecclesiastical establishments to let any form of the genuine article get in."20 Reference to "the genuine article" should alert us to the importance that Armstrong places on the negative theology of the pagan or Hellenic Neoplatonists, in contrast to their theological opponents in late antiquity. The apophatic theology of Hellenic Neoplatonists differed from that of their Middle Platonic predecessors and the Christians in its scope. The key point of contrast is between the "apophatic-kataphatic mixture" found in Middle Platonism,2l with its combination of theological assertion and de- nial, and the more radical and austere apophatic theology of most later Hellenic Neoplatonism. The former often combined denials that God is anything that we could conceive with assertions that God is the supreme Ibid., 1 88. i9Ibid. 20Ibid., 185; compare idem, "The Escape of the One," 87. 2lArmstrong, "The Escape of the One," 77-78. "Middle Platonism" is now conventionally employed to refer to the Platonists who were active prior to the school of Plotinus in the third century CE. These figures, from Philo of Alexandria through Numenius of Apamea, exhibit a less systematic commitment to negative theology, especially to an ultimate divine One beyond "being" and knowledge. The primary study of the period is that of John Dillon, The Middle Platonists (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1977).</page><page sequence="6">444 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW being or intellect. The latter moved to separate the ultimate One from the level of predication or description, availing itself only of the pointer terms, mentioned above, to locate the One or to indicate its systematic location. A richer range of description is eschewed. Middle Platonism is thus en- demically paradoxical, favoring denial or description in different contexts. Neoplatonism, however, insists that the level of theological predication stop at the second hypostatic level, the level of the intelligibles although even here our capacity for finite description is pressed to the breaking point.22 Armstrong holds that, according to this taxonomy, most Christian theol- ogy, especially in the West, has been "Middle Platonic" in its character.23 It has used apophasis as a supplement to kataphasis, in order to underscore the divine mystery or, in some cases, in order to slip out of conceptual aporiae. Thus, "the genuine article" of more radical apophatic theology has not been central to Christian theology.24 This point is important, since Armstrong's views on the contemporary significance of apophatic theology are significantly influenced by his understanding of the incompatibility of orthodoxy and radical apophasis. There are several distinct reasons for the traditional Christian demurral from radical Neoplatonic apophasis. Armstrong has noted in particular that Neoplatonism rejects such critical divine attributes as intellection: the One cannot be adequately described as exercising thought or consciousness. This consorts ill with the biblical imagery of divine attention to human beings and their history. Indeed, radical apophasis would undercut much that Middle Platonists or orthodox Christians might customarily claim, including, re- spectively, the intelligible cosmos or the Holy Trinity.25 It is not the asser- tion that God is personal that occasions problems for Christians. Even though antianthropomorphism may have been nascently involved with negative theology,26 Neoplatonists had strategies for representing the One as per- sonal. Rather, the traditional understanding of Christianity requires a thor- oughgoing commitment to a whole range of divine attributes; without them, core religious doctrines, such as the Incarnation, are theologically unsup- ported. Radical apophasis thus sweeps away Christian dogmatism, even though these concepts and stories remain available in order to direct Chris- tians spiritually in much the same way that the Neoplatonists continued to 22See Armstrong, "The Negative Theology of Nous in Later Neoplatonism," 32-33. 23Armstrong, "The Escape of the One," 77-78 24Ibid., 78. Eastern and Western Christianity have appropriated radical apophasis in dif- ferent ways, however, and there are exceptional figures in each tradition. 25Ibid., 85-86. 26Ibid., 86.</page><page sequence="7">JOHN PETER KENNEY 445 use direction-finding terms for the divine One.27 In large measure, there- fore, Christianity has avoided radical negative theology, preferring instead to use apophasis in counterpoint with the more fundamental assertions of the tradition.28 Armstrong sees this antidogmatism as the basis for the contemporary intellectual and religious appeal of Neoplatonic negative theology. We live in an age in which theological absolutism has broken down; no longer can claims of timeless and universal truth be made about formulations or con- cepts of deity.29 This is due to growing intellectual dissatisfaction with the arguments for incompatible positions, to a renewed but acute sense of our own historical limitations, and to a heightened recognition of the irreduc- ibility of different faiths, each worthy of understanding aIld respect.30 In such a situation, intellectual and moral integrity demand forbearance of putative certainty, whether it is offered on the basis of ecclesiastical, scrip- tural, or philosophical authority. "A genuine religious faith in our time must be compatible with limitless criticism.''3l Dogmas can only have the status of hypotheses. Negative theology represents a form of spirituality, ancient in lineage, that has wrought an intellectual and religious response to this cognitive situation. One aspect of our contemporary religious situation with special signifi- cance for Armstrong's thought is religious pluralism. Here again Hellenic Neoplatonism is apposite, because the moderate skepticism of apophatic theology engendered an attitude of theological tolerance. The famous view of Symmachus sums up this Hellenic viewpoint: "Not by one path only can one reach so great a mystery."32 This approach to alternate religious tradi- tions suggests to Armstrong a fundamental requirement for both the recog- nition of real theological diversity and the acceptance of religious parity.33 The separate paths are distinct and not collapsible according to any simple formula; they each constitute a distinct and irreducible appraisal of the divine. This is something that Armstrong urges conservative Christians in particular to recognize, for Christian intolerance has had a continued, del- 27A. H.

The choice of the way of intolerance by the authorities of Church and Empire in the late fourth century has had some very serious and last- ing consequences. The last vestiges of its practical effects, in the form of the imposition of at least petty and vexatious disabilities on forms of religion not approved by the local ecclesiastical establishment, lasted in some European countries well into my lifetime. And theoretical approval of this sort of intolerance has often long outlasted the power to apply it in practice. After all, as late as 1945 many approved Ro- man Catholic theologians in England, and the Roman authorities, ob- jected to a statement on religious freedom very close to Vatican II's declaration on that subject. In general, I do not think that any Chris- tian body has ever abandoned the power to persecute and repress while it actually had it. The acceptance of religious tolerance and freedom as good in themselves has normally been the belated, though sometimes sincere and whole-hearted, recognition and acceptance of a fait accompli. This long persistence of Theodosian intolerance in practice and its still longer persistence in theory has certainly been a cause, though not the only cause, of that unique phenomenon of our time, the decline not only of Christianity but of all forms of religious belief and the growth of a totally irreligious and unspiritual materialism.34 Beyond mere tolerance, Christianity should welcome other theological points of view. They constitute the "unfamiliar faces of the Logos,"3s and as such they should be valued and respected. Having acquired its fascina- tion with exact theological formulation from the Hellenic tradition, contem- porary Christianity needs to recover Hellenism's own antidote to dogmatism and intolerance, namely, negative theology.36 Perhaps more significant is the need fundamentally to qualify the exclusivism stemming from Chris- tianity's origins in the Abrahamic religious trajectory.37 The tension be- tween the Hellenic or inclusive monotheism and the exclusivism of biblical monotheism has given Christian theology and history a distinctive com- plexity. Armstrong has at times appeared pessimistic about the continuation of these two poles within Christian culture, suggesting that "Our Inherited Conglomerate" to use the phrase of Gilbert Murray and E. R. Dodds is 34A. H. Armstrong, "The Way and the Ways: Religious Tolerance and Intolerance in the Fourth Century A.D.," in idem, Hellenic and Christian Studies, no. 13 (1984) 1. 35A. H.

Armstrong's "wild" Plotinus is the result of a legitimate effort to extract some of the latent tendencies in the Enneads, elements that later resurfaced in medieval Neoplatonism. This version, however, is a radical Plotinus designed with an eye toward certain issues in contemporary the- ology. As Armstrong notes, this approach to the sources is itself a very Platonic project.4l Yet it is striking to contrast Armstrong's moderately skeptical and intensely apophatic Neoplatonism with that of another greater revisionist Neoplatonist in our time, the late J. N. Findlay.42 Findlay's Neoplatonism treats the One as an absolute first principle, a metaphysical entity whose nature is established by philosophical intellection and whose existence is secured by dialectic. There is no room for skepticism here. This contrast underscores the fact that Armstrong's Neoplatonism is but one approach. It is a Platonic theology designed to subvert religious dogmatism and support a broader religious vision. 38Armstrong, "Negative Theology, Myth, and Incarnation," 53-54.

This admission seems to be a critical qualification of his earlier, more theologically skeptical position; its implications require analysis. According to this revised thesis, it would be admitted that the ascension of the spiritual intellect which apophatic theology is meant to initiate could not begin without a fairly well-grounded conception of the divine, since otherwise there would be nothing to negate and nothing to invite the religious imagination to exceed and surpass. An established religious language would seem, therefore, to be a precondition of apophasis. The critical value of negative theology would thus be understood to result from the force of this exception to theological orthodoxy. Hence, there exists an intricate process by which a normative religious language is established with authority and then excerpted and revised to a higher spiritual end. An effective apophatic theology can be seen to derive its critical value from the shock of aphairesis, of conceptual stripping away, and so from the recognition that even the best descriptions of the divine are inadequate. Read in this fashion, Armstrong's thesis of "critical value" can be redrafted and its valence modified with elements he himself has supplied. This binary understanding of negative theology accentuates the kataphatic component in Neoplatonism, including both the claims made on behalf of the intelligibles,44 the second hypostasis, and the significance of a whole cluster of pointer terms diffidently employed in reference to the One. There is no escaping kataphasis; the efficacy of negative theology is proportional to the strength of the theological assertions that it serves to deny. If this is so, as Armstrong himself has now admitted, then orthodoxy and dogmatism have a place in theology, even apophatic theology. The critical value of negative theology would thus appear inevitably to function in much the way that Armstrong has described it as operating within the Christian theo- logical mainstream, namely, as a supplement to an established mode of discourse. The kataphatic and the apophatic theologies are directly interre- lated. It may even be said that apophasis without kataphasis is empty, and kataphasis without apophasis lacks mystery and depth. According to this alternative construal of Armstrong's thesis, the critical value of negative theology may thus be seen as accruing within a number 43Armstrong, "On Not Knowing Too Much About God," 137. 44See Armstrong, "The Negative Theology of Nous in Later Neoplatonism."</page><page sequence="11">JOHN PETER KENNEY 449 of theological traditions in different ways. It goes by different names and serves subtly different ends conditioned by the theological foreground against which it is responding. My own contention has been that Plotinus and some of his predecessors employed it as a means of theological portraiture.45 They clarified and enlarged upon a specific concept of deity that had evolved within the Greco-Roman tradition. To this end, negative theology helped to mark off the absolute status of the One, securing its transcendence and its ontological primacy by separating it from the Platonic level of being. In the developing Abrahamic tradition, however, it served both analogous and different functions, including securing God's ontological status, modifying the vagaries of anthropomorphic imagery, and establishing the singularity and uniqueness of the one true God. In each case, negative theology had a critical value, although its value varied with the character of the norma- tive theological foreground. Negative theology may thus be construed as a formal method in theology, the final import of which is conditioned by the immediate uses to which it is put within a religious tradition. The historical record thus suggests that there are different types of nega- tive theology, each associated with distinct traditions of religious discourse. This diversity would imply that the focus of theological negation was con- ditioned by the needs to which it was put, that is, the varying tasks of theological portraiture within a tradition. Hence, the relevant distinction is not between authentic and suspect forms of apophatic theology as Armstrong's initial "critical value" thesis held46 but among the various forms that negative theology has taken in different religious traditions and indeed within individual religions. The complex and varied use of negative theology by different traditions and subtraditions as part of their own in- digenous strategies for presenting the mystery of divinity is a matter for historians of religion to investigate. An additional problem, however, bears mention: that of portability. Is ancient apophatic theology amenable to translation into contemporary con- ceptual categories? To what extent was the negative theology of the an- cients, of Hellenic, Jewish, and Christian Platonists alike, indexed to the realist ontology of classical Platonism? Can this theology be understood and employed absent this set of metaphysical assumptions and commit- ments? It seems clear that for Philo of Alexandria, Clement of Alexandria, and Plotinus, the intelligible world of being served as a common philo- 45John Peter Kenney, Mystical Monotheism: A Study in Ancient Platonic Theology (Hanover/ London: Brown University Press, 1991); also idem, "Monotheistic and Polytheistic Elements in Classical Mediterranean Spirituality," in Armstrong, Classical Mediterranean Spiritual- ity. 46See above, pp. 440-47.</page><page sequence="12">450 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW sophical springboard for their negative theology. It was this level that the One or some aspect of God was understood to surpass. We are speaking not about simple predication that is exceeded by the One, but the perfect predication if predication it is that obtains in the representation of the forms. More broadly, if the One represents the "surpassing of classical Greek ontology,"47 then negative theology requires this classical ontology to be in the background. This suggests that ancient apophatic theology is rooted in a specific philosophical culture, and that it requires, at the least, a complicated process of conceptual translation in order to make it intelli- gible. To understand ancient apophatic theology adequately, it is necessary clearly to comprehend exactly what the One is represented as exceeding. This contextualist suggestion may help to register a significant concern abollt the contemporary accessibility of the ancient apophatic tradition. It can be illustrated further in reference to Paul Tillich. Inquiring minds, schooled in modern religious thought, may recall Tillich's criticism of the application of "the concept of existence" to God.48 This criticism bears an intended similarity to the ancient apophatic denial of the adequacy of "be- ing" to the One. Yet the ancient apophatic thinkers were not operating in a conceptual environment in which there was a clear-cut notion of "exist- ence," which was understood to be distinct from the essence or nature of a thing.49 This is a later distinction. Thus, they did not question the ad- equacy of the "concept of existence" in reference to the One and certainly not the "existence" of the One as such. Yet they did deny that the One was assimilable to finite beings or to the perfect but conceptually definable divine ideas. Even the perfect "being" of the Platonic forms was deemed unworthy to the infinite One. They also sought, however, to portray the One as the ground of "being," distinct from its ontological products. We are thus faced with the problem of distinguishing the intention of this early theology, which is captured in some respects by modern negative theolo- gians such as Tillich, from the specific idiosyncracies of its formulation. This is a difficult task that must be pursued with scholarly diligence and care. More than conceptualization is involved, however. Whatever one concludes regarding these problems of conceptual translation and the avoid- 47Pierre Aubenque has suggested this point for the Plotinian One; the notion could be expanded to include the first principles of other apophatic theologians. See Pierre Aubenque, "Plotin et le depassement de l'ontologie grecque classique," in Pierre Maxime Schuhl and Pierre Hadot, eds., Le Neoplatonisme (Paris: Editiones du Centre national de la recherche scientifique, 1971) 101-9. 48Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology (2 vols.; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951) 1. 186-210. 49For a discussion of the problem of "being" and "existence" in Greek philosophy and its implication for later Platonic theology, see Kenney, Mystical Monotheism, 3-15.</page><page sequence="13">JOHN PETER KENNEY 451 ance of anachronism, it remains the case that the ancient apophatic theolo- gians understood themselves as contemplatives. They considered the rejec- tion of theological predicates, including preeminent ontological epithets such as "being," to be part of a spiritual program meant to improve recognition of the divine reality within the contemplative soul, and in some cases, to insure the soul's reassimilation into the divine. The broader context of such negative theological discourse was thus significantly different from the largely academic and speculative domain of contemporary negative theol- ogy. The project of theology for Philo and Plotinus was, after all, very different from Tillich's; in the former instances, it demanded an intense commitment to contemplative asceticism along with theological dialectics. We are thus forewarned against too easy an assimilation of ancient apophatic theology, rooted in a contemplative conviction of the One's transcendent presence, with contemporary negative theology, which can fade into uncer- tainty about the reality of the divine. To this latter sort of agnosticism the ancient contemplatives were hostile. W Conclusion A final theological observation concerning dogmatism and theological orthodoxy is apposite. As I have discussed above, there must always be an interplay between positive and negative theology. In a functioning tradition there are many reasons for both to occur and each to flourish. The balance between them will vary among religious traditions and the schools of thought within them. In historical terms, Armstrong's own writings may be under- stood as an effort to reassert the vitality of negative theology at a time and a place at which it was occluded by a domineering dogmatism. This situ- ation suggests a distinction between two sorts of orthodoxy: "authoritarian dogmatism," which demands obeisance to formulas and those who autho- rize them, and "definitional dogmatism," which seeks to set down and clarify beliefs. According to the latter, this process of clarification may be viewed as divinely inspired and sanctioned, but it must also be recognized that these dogmas are meant both to represent the transcendental within the confines of human discourse and to inspire souls to encounter the divine. The best orthodoxy is aware of its theological limitations. Negative theology can be an integral part of definitional dogmatism and may even help to prevent a spiritually constraining sort of orthodoxy from developing. It can also underscore the need for the soul's continual search for God through and beyond these conceptual aids. Dogmas can-and in- deed must-constitute the pointer terms for the via negativa, directing the spiritual vector of the soul. Here the epistemic attitude toward orthodox theology subtly shifts from a tacit descriptivism to a contemplative pragma- tism. Dogmas are not so much pictures or mirrors of the divine as they are</page><page sequence="14">452 HARVARD THEOLOG ICAL REVI EW sanctioned sources of guidance for the soul, rough maps for navigating the supernatural terrain. These predicates, assertions, and images are sanctioned within religious traditions because they have worked: they have been pro- ductive of the contemplative visions of mystics and the conspicuous sanc- tity of saints.SÂ° Thus, theological analogy is understood as anagogy, and orthodoxy becomes contemplative orthopraxy. Although they are as straw before the experience of God, the conceptions of orthodox theology provide the finite context by which contemplation can be personally represented, remembered, and reported. For contemplatives and followers of the via negativa, the affirmations of positive theology remain necessary and are rightly hallowed.5l These remarks are meant to follow from Armstrong's analysis of the fashion in which negative theology functions, although they suggest a less skeptical attitude toward the cognitive value of doctrine. If Armstrong has accentuated the "wild" Plotinus, this analysis is intended to recover the "tame" Armstrong, someone who would countenance a significant role for kataphatic theology. Indeed, the enthusiasm that differentiates Armstrong's moderate, Socratic skepticism from radical, Pyrrhonian skepticism is itself a tacit admission on his part of some undefined spiritual direction. In Armstrong's negative theology, just as in the ancient Platonists, one never encounters any serious doubt about the reality of the One, only skepticism about our capacity to define or describe it. If pressed, this recognition and the pointer terms that go with it can become the basis of a positive theol- ogy. Everything depends on the attitude that one brings to these assertions. For them to work as a soundboard for apophatic theology, however, they must be more than just hypotheses. Clearly, the efficacy of certain spiritual strategies has lent these theological affirmations great prestige; they can be revered as defining the conceptual foundations for contemplation, or they can harden into a normative structure that seems an end in itself. The significance of Armstrong's "critical value" thesis is that it clarifies the way in which apophatic theology has been corrosive to the latter sort of dogma- tism, the orthodoxy that leads to spiritual sclerosis. We may note in closing that Armstrong's studies have provided a fine example of historical theology, that is, theological reflection emerging from 50Although this has the appearance of a contemporary move, I believe such "contempla- tive pragmatism" has deep roots in ancient mystical theology, but this subject cannot be explored here. 5lHere the recent effort to focus on the conservative character of mysticism is apposite; see Stephen Katz, ed., Mysticism and Religious Tradition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1 983).</page><page sequence="15">JOHN PETER KENNEY 453 historical inquiry. It is sometimes suggested that the history of ancient philosophy and theology is fundamentally antiquarian, scholarship for scholarship's sake. Armstrong's papers, however, belie such sentiments; their signiElcance is both historical and theological. Moreover, they are not nar- rowly theological, given their varying loci from Downside Abbey to Ascona. These are the essays of a genuine historical theologian, whose thought is grounded in a lifetime of historical research in classical and patristic the- ology, the Cambridge Platonist of our time.52 52This paper was read at the "Platonism and Neoplatonism Group of the American Acad- emy of Religion during its annual meeting in November 1992 in San Francisco, CA. My thanks to the session participantss including Robert Berchman, Jay Bregman, Kevin Corrigan, and Huston Smith, for their observations. I am also grateful to Professor Armstrong for the opportunity to discuss these issues with him over more than a decade. Thanks are also due to both Jo Cannon and Kathy Stackhouse of Reed College, who have been very helpful with the production of this paper.</page></plain_text>
