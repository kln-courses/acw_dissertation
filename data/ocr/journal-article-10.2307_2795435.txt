Cf MAN, I947, I4I SIR,-Under the above title you were good enough to J27 print, in September, I947, an illustrated description by me of certain cruciform images which had been deposited on an ancient tomb at Awlad 'Ali beside the Wadi el- 'Arish in Sinai. My article ended with the words: 'The intention to make them as human as possible was clearly evident. But as to why the images were deposited there (annually) the shy Tarabin would not vouchsafe any explanation.' Upon a later visit in August, I95I, I was able to obtain more information. These brightly dressed images are called by the Tarabin 'brides' and are awarded as prizes to the successful competitors in the horse and camel races held annually on the spot. My Muslim informant was rather ashamed of such pagan goings-on. Milltimber, Aberdeenshire G. W. MURRAY</page></plain_text>
