<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LITERATURE OF THE SCOTTISH GAEL REV. DONALD MACLEAN, M.A. (EDINBURGH) I THERE is substantial evidence for the belief that the monks of the Celtic Church in Scotland were bookmen and scholars. What remains of their scholarship we have in the manu- scripts in the British Isles and the Continent encourages the deserved admiration that sees through the thick mist of the intervening ages earnest students sedulously investi- gating the sacred writ, and bringing their acquired and native talent to bear on the problems that confront them. The virility, stamina, and self-respect that characterised our race owe not a little to the infusion into our veins of the blood of those intrepid sailors from the lands of the North, who scoured our seas and harried our coastline. Yet we deplore the Norse barbarity that assigned to the fire and to the sea the achievements of this devout scholar- ship. What would we not give to have now in our posses- sion records of those monks' outlook on life and its intricate problems, their view of the pagan religion and the general status of society, as well as the wit and humour that gave life a charming ease and a soothing relief. In the three well-known books-the Antiphonary of Bangor, written before 691 ; Liber Hymnorum, transcribed about the latter</page><page sequence="2">346 THE CELTIC REVIEW half of the eleventh century ; and Leabhar Breac, transcribed before 1411-we have litanies, invocations, and poems of adoration, which bear more directly upon the work of the Christian preacher, and indicate much literary merit as well as deep religious feeling. But there. must have been much more than those produced in the collegiate schools of Iona and Applecross, at the disappearance of which we feel a deep pang of regret. MEDIZEVAL ROMANTIC LITERATURE In the Ulster cycle of literature that revolves round the central figures of Conchobar and Cushulinn, we have presented to us with a precision which is substantiated by classic writers who were observers or recorders of the events portrayed, a history of the pre-Christian social life of the Gaels. Here we have depicted to us the wars of mighty monarchs and petty kings, tribal jealousies, and inter- tribal rivalries, the roistering life in the sumptuous hall, the happy buoyancy of the life of the chase, the striking ethics and coarse morality, and the undoubted chivalry and heroism of pagan people living in pagan culture and in- fluenced by pagan sentiments. The Leinster-Munster cycle, with Fionn and Ossian as its central figures, develops at a later period, and flows down to us, gathering colour and substance from the vicissitudes of conquest and defeat that characterised the periods through which it streamed, and increasing in volume until it takes such a prominence in the popular estimation as ousts entirely the earlier cycle. This latter cycle has its origin sunk in deep and almost impenetrable obscurity. The solvents that have been brought to bear on the problems that surround its rise have not yet succeeded in proving to us that these wonderful romances rest upon an historic basis. Their supposed origin in the second or third centuries does not coincide with the historical facts disclosed within the texts. The books which supply us with the ballads that surround Fionn, Ossian,</page><page sequence="3">THE LITERATURE OF THE SCOTTISH GAEL 347 Caoilte, Oscar, Diarmaid and Grainne are: the Dean of Lismore's book, Leabhhar na Feinne; Campbell's Tales of the West Highlands; Dr. Cameron's Reliquice Celtice ; and the collections of manuscripts not transcribed in the latter book, but available in the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh, and elsewhere. Here, then, we have a great heroic-mythic romance. The heroes in the ballads are men of gigantic proportions, before whom ordinary mortals are but insignifi- cant entities. They achieve superhuman feats of strength and bravery, distance is no barrier to their movements; the raging ocean, the towering hills, and all else in Nature form no impassable barrier to their efforts. Always chivalrous and courageous, boundless generosity is perhaps their chief attribute, as Caoilte sings of the lordly Fionn: 'Were but the brown leaf which the wood sheds from it gold, were but the white billows silver, Fionn would have given it all away.' Who are the prototypes of this race of warriors ? has been asked, but no satisfactory answer has been given. Have we here impersonated gods of an earlier paganism ? The doctrine of incarnation is prevalent among the Celts. Fionn himself re-incarnated is Mongan. The descent of the gods to confer the primary attributes of manhood is found among Australian aborigines. Their Byamee, through the minor deity Wooroomah (God of wind), descends, and a boy becomes a man. Survival of a similar belief is still discoverable in the superstitious conception of our people in regard to the development of the human embryo. Another phase in the development of the heroic ideal is found in the double names of most of the heroes connoting seemingly contrary views and ideals which are combined in an effort to harmonise opposing principles ? Fionn is also Demne. Cf. Mars, Vintios, Zeus, Pluto, Poseidon, etc. Have we not here, in fact, the gods reconciled in persons that express the ideals and aspirations of the people rather than an organised warrior band raised among the tribes of the Scottish kingdom to resist and oppose Lochlannich ? That this latter word signifies not only the Norse, but any</page><page sequence="4">348 THE CELTIC REVIEW opponents of the people that dwell in the lochs or in the inaccessible swamps of their land, and ever a threatening and dangerous foe, gives colour to the contention of his- torical and exegetical criticism that here we have a mythical romance without any basis in history or prototypes for its warriors,'but which, however, contains within it those aspects of social life and religion that the poets of the period thought fit to commit to story. But it is conceivable and even probable that Fionn and Ossian had their prototypes in men who sprang from the race, and who, because of certain high qualities that clearly differentiate them from the common stock, were at once invested by the popular fancy with the attributes of the gods, and adQred as such. A clear analogy to this is found in the reverence accorded by the Lycaonians to Barnabas and Paul, whom they recognised as Jupiter and Mercurius respectively. Such a deifying of heroes affords the most reasonable and natural basis for the hero-worship which finds ample expression in the Ossianic ballads, in the magniloquent panegyrics of post-mediteval poets, and in the exaggerated elegies of more recent date. The warrior chief conceived by the idealising fancy of the medioeval Gael is ' Braver than kings ; foremost always, of vigorous deeds, a hero brave, untired in fight, leopard in fight, fierce as a hound, of woman beloved.' The chieftain of feudal times, and ministers and 'men' of a more enlightened age have each and all been extolled and assigned such a place in the popular imagination that differs from that of the heroes of this romance not so much in nature as in degree, and in objectivity more than subjectivity. Generally those romances introduce us to the social life of the community in later pagan times and during the early Middle Ages. We have stories of the chase, in which the people revelled. We have warfare, but not so exhaus- tively or precisely delineated in details as are other aspects of the passing history. We have bounteous hospitality and a patriotic chivalry; and further, the contrast between</page><page sequence="5">THE LITERATURE OF THE SCOTTISH GAEL 349 Christianity and paganism, or of the opposing principles that were struggling for victory, which appeared at times in sharp and bitter antagonism. It is a striking feature of the romances that those of the earlier or pre-medieval ones show a contrast between Christianity and paganism im- personated in Ossian and Patrick, which presents ideals in closer alliance with the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- turies than with the Middle Ages. In pre- and post- medieval times the attitude of Christianity is that of an uncompromising opponent of the prevailing paganism-it gives it no quarters-while in the middle period both look at each other with apparent self-satisfying complacency. There is wanting in the middle period on both sides that precision of statement and differentiation of the causes that stand opposed the one to the other which presents them- selves in the other periods in language that may be harsh on the one hand, and frankly barbarous on the other, but which nevertheless indicate a vitality and a reality which impress upon the reader that here there are evidences of Christianity's youthful vigour in its first impact with paganism, as well as the certainty of faith and lofty ethics which sprung into lively exercise and fully developed during the post-reformation centuries in which the later manu- scripts bearing the romances were written. This indomi- table paganism reaches the highest level of defiance in the truly anthropomorphic conception of God with which Ossian rails at Patrick:- ' Were my son Oscar and God Hand to hand on the hill of the Fianns If I saw my son down I'd say that God was a strong man.' The difference in the ballads of the middle period may truly be ascribed to the spirit of an age of moribund or decadent spiritual life rather than to the assiduity of any harmoniser who in his story might gloss over the prevailing thought in order to reconcile opposing principles. Still, all the ballads that cluster round Ossian are wonderfully</page><page sequence="6">350 THE CELTIC REVIEW homogeneous in characterisation, in locale, in themes, and personages. Differences are more marked in style of expres- sion, and in the tone and vigour with which thoughts are uttered. But throughout them all, there is a sensitiveness to nature that is impressive, there is a gentle pathos, a soft tone of melancholy that sometimes rises to a shrill cry of poignant yearning for the return of the days that are gone. There is a joyous bound, an intimate fellow- ship with animal life, a rush into the glamour of what is remote and illusory. And there is nothing in contemporary European literature that expresses the passion of love with such keen intensity as this song of Grainne for her beloved Diarmaid, which is as old as the tenth century :- ' There lives a man On whom I would love to gaze long, For whom I would give the whole world. O Son of Mary! though a privation.' Though a heathen heroine porclaiming love by the Son of Mary presents a disturbing anachronism which would suggest the anxiety of a Christian redactor to enhance the charm of the unhappy wife of Fionn, that does not in the least invalidate the genuineness of the poem which was redacted. This solitary poem, in which we have Grainne's deep and intense love for Diarmaid, gives a glimpse of what is really a sweetening and relieving tone, colouring the generally sombre romance of life in those far-off days. Nevertheless, those distant ages have transmitted to the modern Scot a good deal of their spirit, discernible in the sympathy with Nature, and love for the woodland, for the mountain and the sea which find expression in the literature of modern times. Their influence on our religious literature is even more marked. The claim of the Druidic priesthood to control the elements by means of incantations imposed upon the Christian missionaries the necessity of proving the superior powers of Christ, as being greater than the greatest Druid; hence the origin of those invocations which were so potent in the sphere of the miraculous, and</page><page sequence="7">THE LITERATURE OF THE SCOTTISH GAEL 351 which have invested the early missionaries with such super- human qualities as have made the record of their lives transmitted to us as fabulous as that of any modern necro- mancer or ancient Druid priest. The Luireach means a corslet or breastplate. Patrick's hymn, and hymns of a similar character, were intended to form a shield of defence against forces visible and invisible of varying degrees of animosity and hostility. This form of invocation, many examples of which are found in Dr. Carmichael's Carmina Gadelica, have been succeeded by the charms which up to the present day are the analogous instrument used for similar purposes. The eschatology of our forefathers did not escape this influence. The pagans' view of hell was a place of exposure and cold. This conception arose un- doubtedly from the climatic conditions that prevailed, where the most extreme penalty that could overtake a mortal would consist in being the shelterless victim of the roaring tempest, the piercing winds, and the dark and dismal night. This view of a place of torment is seen in the Christian hymnology of the Middle Ages, in the Fernaig Manuscript of 1689, and in David M'Kellar's poems of 1780, and others. In one of our oldest and most beautiful Gaelic hymns we have this expression:- 'It were my soul's desire Not to know cold hell.' Duncan MacRae of Inverinate, writing in 1688 of the Day of Judgment, thus describes the condition of the lost : 'They shall depart so sadly Into cold hell where there is coldness.' And another old poet says :- 'What a fool to choose cold hell, The cave of prickly thorns! I shudder at the thought Of hell cold and wet.' The pagan view of heaven was a land of eternal youth, the abode of warrior chiefs and princes-a green and sunny isle</page><page sequence="8">352 THE CELTIC REVIEW floating somewhere in the Western Ocean, where the sun ever shone, and which bid defiance to the blowing horns of the howling tempest. Peace undisturbed prevailed, and the joyous buoyancy of a continuous youth formed the ideal of perfect happiness after which even the pagan mind had striven. 1500-1725 When Bishop Carswell published Knox's Prayer Book in Gaelic in 1659, he ushered in the first period of printed Gaelic literature, and deserves the enviable distinction of being the father of the printed literature of the Scottish Gael. His pious aim in publishing this book was to provide material for the guidance of the people in devotion. Now it is a canon of criticism that literature postulates a knowledge of letters, and it would certainly have been futile and a vain, self-sacrificing ordinance on the part of this first editor to throw the product of arduous labours on a com- munity that were incapable of making use of the publica- tion. Ireland and Scotland were politically, socially, and linguistically identical. There was a community of interest in the common heritage, and a free intercourse of thought and aspiration. Harpists, bards, story reciters, and scholars crossed and re-crossed, and it is safe to say that in no part of Britain was there such a mass of ancient literature and a keener cultivation of it. To suggest, as Lord Rosebery did at the recent celebrations at St. Andrews, that the overthrow of the Northern Celts at Harlaw in 1411 was the conquest of barbarism by civilisation is evidence of palpable ignorance or an ignoring of the potency of letters and literature as factors in civilising races. During the supremacy of the Lords of the Isles over large tracts of the north of Ireland and the whole of the north and the west of Scotland, colleges of learning were encouraged by these petty monarchs; and from the suggestive reference in Carswell's dedicatory epistle to 'the learned men in Albhan and Eireand, skilled in poetry and history and some good</page><page sequence="9">THE LITERATURE OF THE SCOTTISH GAEL 353 scholars,' there is clearly indicated the prevalence of letters among the people in his day, while the further reference to 'those who prefer and practice the forming of vain, hateful, and lying earthly stories about Tuatha de Dhanond and about the songs of Melesius, and about the heroes of Fiann Maccumhil, and about many others whom I shall not number or tell off in detail' puts beyond any reasonable doubt that there existed a mass of literature, either in manuscript or orally recited, which unfortunately has not been transmitted to us. It would have been interesting to know the stories about the 'many others' here referred to, and what these stories reflected of the life and ways of the community at the time. Following upon Carswell's book, of which only three copies are now known to exist, one of which-the Duke of Argyll's-was sold a few years ago in a London saleroom for w500, the next book to appear in Gaelic is Calvin's Catechism, translated in Argyllshire, 1631; the first fifty Psalms, translated and published by the Synod of Argyll in 1631. Kirk's Psalter appeared in 1684; Lawrence Charteris Catechism in 1688; Kirk's Bible, 1690; Nicolson's Historical Library, 1702; Baxter's Call to the Unconverted, translated by the Rev. Mr. MacFarlane, 1725; Confession of Faith, 1725 ; Macdonald's Vocabulary, 1741. At the end of Kirk's Bible there are a few pages of vocabulary, and attached to the fifty Psalms of 1651 is a Shorter Catechism, and to the complete Book of Psalms in 1694 is also added a Catechism. Not less than eight editions of the Psalms and the Catechism passed through the press before 1745. In the Dean of Lismore's book, which came to light at a much later date, we have religious poems. The Fernaig Manuscript, published in the Reliquice Celticwe, contains also many pieces composed about 1689 of a religious and political nature. We have the Book of Clanranald Mac- vurich, which contains to a large extent the history of the wars of Montrose, Ossianic ballads, and eulogies of living heroes of the Clan Donald. But this is by no means the VOL. VII. Z</page><page sequence="10">354 THE CELTIC REVIEW entire literature of the period. It is the small beginnings of printed literature, traversing only a short, and in many respects an unfruitful, period. When John Reid published the Bibliotheca Scoto-Celtica in 1832, the entire literature of the Highlands then amounted to four hundred and sixty volumes, including editions and reprints, but now it has reached nearly fifteen hundred and fifty. The only printed material of the period under review is what has already been referred to. Before now the Gaels of Ireland were gradually separating politically and linguistically from the Gaels of Scotland. With the gradual advance of the Reformation the gap between both was widening, but the Highlands were awakening to a deeper interest in religion and letters. It is not therefore surprising that the entire output is of a religious character. Although it is admitted that we owe our Christianity to Ireland, it is not sufficiently recognised that we owe also to the same country the divine oracles that enshrine it. In 1602 William O'Donnel published the New Testament in Gaelic with type supplied by Queen Elizabeth, which is the first published edition of the Scrpitures in that lan- guage either in this country or in Ireland. Bishop William Bedell, an Englishman, prominent as a Protestant and as an indefatigable Churchman, was appointed Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1627, and was raised in 1629 to the bishopric of Kilmore and Ardagh in Ireland. He addressed himself soon after his enthronement to the praiseworthy enterprise of getting the Scriptures into the language of the people. These are his own words in his biography : 'And surely it was a work agreeable to the mind of God that the poor Irish, being a very numerous nation, besides the greater half of Scotland, and all those islands called Hebrides, that lie in the Irish Sea, and many of the Orcades also that speak Irish, should be enabled to search the Scriptures (as others) that in them they might find the way that leads to everlasting life, which they could never do whiles the Scriptures remained a sealed book to them.'</page><page sequence="11">THE LITERATURE OF THE SCOTTISH GAEL 355 In this work he was helped by Murtach King and Owen O'Sheridene. His translation was published in 1685, and two hundred copies of Bedell's Bible were sent for distribu- tion among the families in the Highlands of Scotland. Robert Kirk of Balquhidder, who has not received deserved recognition at the hands of his countrymen, conceiving the difficulty that people might have in reading the Bible in Irish characters, undertook and finished transcribing the whole Bible and New Testament into Roman letters in 1690. So laborious and industrious was this man, both in the transcrip- tion of the Bible and in the translation of the Psalms, that he adopted the novel device of preventing himself from fall- ing asleep when engaged with his task by holding a piece of lead in his mouth over a basin of water, whose splash summoned his mental activities into livelier exercise. Thus indirectly, as has been noted, the Bible has come to us from across the Channel. But it should not be forgotten that the charge of neglect against the clergy of Scotland in the field of literature, and in providing the sacred Scrip- tures for the people, is not entirely warranted by the facts, for we find the Rev. Dugald Campbell of North Knapdale, at the instigation of the Synod of Argyll, translating the Pentateuch and some other parts into Gaelic before Novem- ber 1660, and he was advised to proceed immediately with the translation of Ecclesiastes. His manuscript, which has not been published, has had a chequered career, and is now believed to be deposited somewhere in the neighbour- hood of Sydney, New South Wales. The literature under review has flowed down to us in two parallel channels, widely separated, refreshing and fertilising the same soil. This soil is the Highland people. In the one channel flowed the religious and sacred writings and sayings; in the other, the purely secular. Between the two there was a difference in ideals, in ethics, and morality. The one appealed to and tried to uplift man in his spiritual side, the other largely addressed itself to the human emotions and feelings, and developed the</page><page sequence="12">356 THE CELTIC REVIEW sensuous in man. The unfortunate antagonism that appears between these two in our literature was hurtful to both. The religious writers and readers, instead of assimi- lating the truly beautiful elements in the secular, ostracised it as a whole because of certain gross defects in parts. This tended to make the secular more coarse, and helped in- directly to introduce into it that immoral realism that is a painful feature of later poets. Still it is true that both contributed their share in developing that mental culture and personal characteristics that distinguish our people to-day. To the religious we look for the history of ecclesi- astical questions and problems, and in them we find invalu- able aid to a true appreciation of the coiitroversies of the time. A poet, in the Book of the Dean of Lismore, who is an eyewitness, speaking before 1512, says : ' I myself, Robert, went Yesterday to a monastery, And I was not allowed in Because my wife was not with me.' This naively suggestive allusion indicates the state of public feeling towards the questionable morality within the monasteries that is worth more than volumes of present- day apologetics or ingenious critical discussions. Nor need one hesitate for a moment to affirm the sturdy Episcopacy of Duncan MacRae of Inverinate (1688), who wrote : ' But keep us united In this thy true faith From the haverings and lies Of Presbyterian and Priest.' The development of theological thought within the com- munity we find reflected in the religious poetry of the period, of which there is a considerable quantity of varying merit. The progress of Reformed thought can easily be traced. The invocations and poems of adoration gradually give place to that introspection which reaches its full development in a later period. The doctrine of sin, of</page><page sequence="13">THE LITERATURE OF THE SCOTTISH GAEL 357 judgment, the atonement, retribution, and the like are referred to, but of real didactic verse we have little. The teaching poets had not yet arrived. When religion in its various aspects impresses a people for the first time, it is itself also invariably impressed. Amalgamating the enthusiasm of the new convert, it gives gaiety to his joy, tone to his ecstasy, and gloom to his melancholy. Though it destroys the credulity of scepticism, it may exaggerate the credulity of superstition in the mind that is neither enlightened nor analytical. Thus the pro- phecies of such men as the Brahan Seer, a crystal gazer who was born in the island of Lewis in the beginning of the seventeenth century, were indeed an important part of our oral literature. They were accepted by a religious people whose joy or gloom having been intensified by mental concentration on the newly discovered prophecies of revela- tion impels them to give credence to whatever makes a fair claim to come within the region of the prophetic. On this assumption can we fairly account for this class of litera- ture, whose rise synchronises with the introduction of the Christian faith, and its decay with the advance and enlight- ened knowledge of that faith. Concurrently with the published literature, there floated among the people the medical literature of the M'Conachers, M'Beaths, or Beatons, comprising discussions on the physical sciences, astronomy, astrology, philosophy, and metaphysics, oral traditions and romances, as well as a mass of poetry that reflected the passing phases of life. Among the con- tributors to this stream of literature, we have such men as Maclosa O'Daly, chief sage or poet of Eirin and Alba, died 1185; Muiredhach Albannach, died 1224; Tadg O'Higgin, died 1448; and others. Later, we have James Macgregor, the Dean of Lismore, with his brother Duncan, 1512-26 ; Duncan Macrae of Inverinate and his two clerical brothers, and the Macvurichs; Domnull Mac Fhionnlaidh na Dan, who flourished in the early part of the seventeenth century; and to this period belong M'Intyre--the Bard of</page><page sequence="14">358 THE CELTIC REVIEW Macintosh-Maclean of Duart, Mary Maclean, the middle of the seventeenth century; Nicossain of Uist, John Macdonald, Ian Lom, 1620-1710; Archibald Macdonald, 1688 ; Angus Macdonald, Mary Macleod, 1650-1720 ; Brian, the Assynt poet; Julia Macdonald, 1670-1709. We have also Lachlan MacKinnon, died about 1734; Murdo Mathe- son, bard of Seaforth; Roderick Morrison, the blind harper; John Mackay, the hereditary family piper of Gairloch, and others. The most eminent of these is un- doubtedly Mary Macleod. With her advent in the field of poetry came a marked change on the intricate and diffi- cult metrics of the old Gaelic poetry. She, too, is the sweetest, most precise, and perhaps the most elegant of our poets. Her verses glide on with a soft and gentle smooth- ness, like waters running over the surface of polished stones. She describes to us the life in the halls of the high chiefs with a precision that marks the poem as a contribution to the history of the period. She eulogises the great men of the day. The chase, the mountain, the stag and hounds, and the social condition of the people surrounding the hall of the chieftain are all brought before our vision with dis- criminating and intelligent interest. John Macdonald, Ian Lom, has the honour of being the first of the long line of Jacobite poets. He is a satirist and a eulogist according to the subject which he handles. Montrose and the heroes of the Macdonalds are described in language and diction of high praise. His satires have a tone of asperity about them. Still his contribution to literature is of historical importance and high literary value. The other poets, like those in the Fernaig Manuscript, are deeply religious and strongly Jacobite as are nearly all the poets of the people. Peering across the vista of the ages, and looking to the literature that we have surveyed from early dawn till the end of the period under review, we find contributors to it from among the men whose intellects have been tutored in the schools, and from among the unlettered rustics of the country. The former may have been bound by the literary</page><page sequence="15">THE LITERATURE OF THE SCOTTISH GAEL 359 convention of their times, the latter broke through these into fresh fields. The illiterate poets, like Mary Macleod and others of that class, are perhaps the most interesting, as being the most true to human nature. They lay in the lap of Nature, with their ear to her throbbing heart and their hand on her pulse. They watched the seasons' changing moods: they heard the sigh of the wind, the soft melan- choly murmur of the waves upon the shore. The thunder, the storm, the moods and fancies of men, the tragic, pathetic, and comic in the drama of life, they have depicted to us in the poetry which has been transmitted. The class of poetry which predominates in this entire mass is the panegyric or eulogistic. The chieftains of later days are glorified with- out any fear of exaggerating their virtues, their courage, and their chivalry. This is what we might expect, for the spirit of Gaelic poetry is one of praise. The heroes of the Ossianic period may have been glorified impersonated gods; their successors in the popular imagination were real men, to whom, however, glory and honour are ascribed in a similar unstinted fashion. The fervour of intense nationalism per- vades the whole; but the outlook is narrow, and prevents a worthy appreciation of forces and personages that oppose the national spirit and aspiration. We have songs of the chase, with the joy attached thereto ; we hear the clash of arms, and we see the carnage. Songs of industry and waulk- ing songs have their note of practical interest, and reach their sublimest form during this period. The genealogical tree mingles with feats of valour and local social life of the people in songs that depict the varying phases of existing conditions. We have boat songs of three grades. There are lullabies too-so different from those of modern times; a tone of melancholy softness pervades them. The thought of fear more than anything else seems to ring through them, and the effect of fairy belief comes into clear relief. There are no dramatic writings worthy of the name, nor are there lengthened epics with sustained power and a magnificent display like those of ancient Greece, and what is even more</page><page sequence="16">360 THE CELTIC REVIEW striking, we have but few love-songs. True it is that Grainne long ago expressed her love for Diarmaid with a passion and intensity unparalleled in literature of the time. With the Dean of Lismore we find no such tenderness. His seven pieces that treat of women are satires of a bitter character. The chief satirist in the collection reaches the depth of his depreciation of womankind in the words : 'I dislike a table where a woman sits; may my curse amongst women rest'; and yet again: 'It is best to have nothing to do with women.' There are occasionally pieces during the early post-Reformation period, such as Maclean of Duart's love- song (sixteenth century), which can equal, in the beauty of its description and the intensity of its affection, any of the best known love-songs of a later age :- 'The topmost grain in the ear, As sapling that in young wood grows, As the sun that hideth the stars So art thou among women.' But the absence from the literature of any appreciable quantity of such songs must be traceable to aspects of religion and morality which had been transmitted from the early pagan times of matriarchy. It is Grainne that expresses her love for Diarmaid. Here is a sidelight thrown upon the facts of history which show the loose and unchecked relationship of womankind with man in pagan times, when the priority of the choice of spouse lay with the woman rather than with the man. This view of the social relationship filtered even through Christian ethics and morality down to the reformed times. The Norse invasion, too, had its baneful effect upon the morals of the people and the status of woman as is still observable in their subordination in those parts of the country where the Norse sway was felt strongest. The ethics which liberated woman from this thraldom, and elevated her to her position in the family and in society have been the outcome of the Reformed Faith, and not until the latter half of the eighteenth century was their effect clearly felt upon the literature of the Scottish Gael.
