The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man: An Essay on Speculative Thought in the Ancient Near East. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1946. VI, 4C1 pp. As the subtitle indicates, this book represents an attempt to describe, analyze, and evaluate some of the more significant aspects of speculative thought in the ancient Near East. The sources utilized consist almost entirely of the literary remains of three Near Eastern peoples: the Egyptians, the Mesopotamians (Sumerians and Accadians), and the Hebrews. The volume is therefore divided into three major divisions entitled "Egypt", "Mesopotamia", and "The Hebrews." The speculative thought of the ancient Egyptians, that is, roughly speaking, their metaphysics, politics, and ethics, are described and analyzed by John Wilson under the rubrics "The Nature of the Universe," "The Function of the State," and "The Values of Life;" that of the Mesopotamians is treated by Thorkild Jacobsen under the headings "The Cosmos as a State," "The Function of the State," and "The Good Life;" that of the ancient Hebrews is discussed by William A. Irwin in chapters entitled "God," "Man," "Man in the World," and "Nation, Society, and Politics," Preceding these three main divisions is a theme-setting introductory chapter by H. and H. A. Frankfort, entitled "Myth and Reality;" it analyzes the psychological characteristics which distinguish ancient Near Eastern thought with particular stress on its supposedly irrational approach and mythopoeic logic. Finally the same authors conclude the book .with a chapter entitled "The Emancipation of Thought from Myth," which begins with a brief comparative survey of Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Hebrew speculative thought, and con- cludes with a sketch of the doctrines of the early Greek philosophers from Thales to Parmenides, who, according to the authors, destroyed the last hold of myth on thought. As is obvious from the preceding outline of its contents, the volume undertakes to present a far-reaching and many-sided synthesis of the intellectual and spiritual concepts prevailing during a long and productive period in the history of civilization, a5 and the authors are to be congratulated on their courage and optimism as well on their significant achievement. Near East scholars are only too well aware how complex, difficult, and at times truly heart-rending a task it is to dig out, piece together, and formulate the philosophic and religious concepts of the ancients from their varied,</page><page sequence="2">Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure fragmentary, and not too lucid literary remains. Not only the educated layman, therefore, but the Near East specialist as well is deeply indebted to the authors for their clearly worded and highly stimulating efforts on a subject so elusive and yet so attractive as ancient man's speculative thought. Now while on the whole the book represents a noteworthy and valuable contribution to the history of man's spiritual development, it must not be inferred that all (or even most) of its conclusions and generalizations are to be taken as valid and final. Indeed it is good to note that the authors themselves are not unaware of the subjective and one- sided character of some of their interpretations and hypotheses and forewarn the reader to a certain extent. The basic difficulty lies of course with the present status of our source material. If we take Mesopotamia as an example -- and it is only of the Mesopota- mian material that the reviewer is qualified to speak -- we find in the first place that the texts utilized spread over a period of some two thousand years, from the third to the first millennium B.C. Throughout this long period, the land witnessed numerous ethnic an:l political upheavals; the very language changed from Sumerian to Akkadian. Under such circumstances it is obviously no simple task to extract the typical Mesopotamian mind and to abstract its underlying philosophic and religious concepts. In addition to this fundamental difficulty, there is the matter of the fragmentary and obscure character of many of the literary texts. In particular the Sumerian literary composition -- and these are far more numerous and on the whole more significant for the problem than those written in Akkadian - are only now in the process of being translated and interpreted by a mere handful of scholars, and only with a fair degree of success. As matters now stand there is considerable room for differences of opinion on the actual translation of some of this material, not to speak of its more general interpretation within the framework of Mesopotamian thought. It is some of these differences of opinions which are presented in the pages to follow. To begin with the introductory chapter "Myth and Reality," it is of the utmost importance to note that it contains a number of statements with regard to the character- istic features of the mind of Near Eastern man, whose validity is more than doubtful, at least as far as Mesopotamia is concerned. It is the underlying conviction of the authors of this chapter -- and ortunately it is this conviction which serves as the unifying theme for the several divisions of the book -- that the ancients were unable to think reflectively; that they lacked the detachment of intellectual inquiry; that their thought was of necessity "wrapped in imagination;" that the cosmos always appeared to them as a 40</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) "Thou" experienced emotionally in a dynamic reciprocal relationship and that, like primitive man, therefore, they simply did not know an inanimate world; that in the ancient Near East, as in present day primitive society, thought did not operate autono- mously, but the whole man confronted a living "Thou" in nature, and that all experience of this "Thou" could be conceived only as action and thus necessarily takes the form of a story; that therefore the ancients could only tell myths and were presumably unable to present analyses or conclusions. In order to illustrate the inability of the ancient Mesopotamian to think of natural events other than in a mythopoeic framework, the authors give the following example: "We would explain, for instance, that certain atmospheric changes broke a drought and brought about rain. The Babylonian observed the same facts but experienced them as the intervention of the gigantic bird Imdugud which came to their rescue. It covered the sky with the black storm clouds of its wings and devoured the Bull of Heaven, whose hot breath had scorched the crops." Now at least as far as Mesopotamia is concerned, this psychological analysis of the mind of ancient Near Eastern man is without basis in fact. In the case of the Sumerians, for example, there is good evidence to show that they had a group of thinkers who were quite capable of viewing nature with a detached and reflective mind; ! that they were quite aware that nlature was inanimate as well as animate and that they actually made this distinction in word as well as thought;2 that within the narrow range of their limited and superficial data they succeeded in working out a systematic metaphysics and theology which became more or less paradigmatic for large parts of the Near East, and that this was probably due to no small extent to their rational approach and relatively consistent logic. Finally, to take the example cited by the authors, it is most unlikely that even the average Mesopotamian, not to speak of his more reflective brother, would say of the 1. Cf. e.g. the Sumerian passage quoted in SI 113 note 37 where the an and ki of the first two lines cannot possibly be rendered other than "heaven" and "earth" in the sense of physical realms and not as living entities; for additional proof cf. line 4 of the same passage. 2. Thus the Sumerian phrase for living creature is usually nimg-i-daL, Akkadian ?.iknat nat.pitim, "that which has breath," in short, our very word "animate." This expression, be it noted, is used only of men and animals, and never of such natural phenomena as plants and trees, stones and metal, rivers and fields, Obviously, therefore, there were Sumerian thinkers who actually divided nature into animate and inanimate, the distin- guishing criterion being the capacity to breathe. To be sure, for the purpose of myth and fable, prayer and ritual, some one or another inanimate object might be treated aS if it were animate; indeed to a certain extent this happens in our own day and age. But that is by no means the same as saying that the Mesopotamian mind was unable to conceive nature and the cosmos except as a living "Thou". 41</page><page sequence="4">Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure drought-breaking rain that it was the Imdugud bird who devoured the Bull of Heaven; like the average man today he would probably say that it was the clouds3 which brought the refreshing rain.4 What has misle6d the authors into a mistaken notion of the basic characteristics of speculative thought in the ancient Near East is the essentially mythopoeic nature of their source material. For, again restricting ourselves to Mesopotamia, it is quite true that relatively little detached speculative thought on nature and the cosmos is to be found in the extant literary material, since by far the larger part consists of myths and epic tales, hymns and lamentations, that is, literary genres which utilize a highly mythopoeic approach and technique. But this fact hardly ,justifies the conclusion that the early Mesopotamian thinkers were incapable of rational and detached thought in regard to nature in the universe, or that they failed to develop a systematic metaphysics and theology; indeed, our literary sources, in spite of their essentially mythopoeic character, presuppose the existence of such systems and reflect them at every turn. All that one is Justified in conluding from the one-sided character of our Mesopotamian literary material is that the early Mesopotamian scribes and men of letters had failed to develop a written literary genre to serve as an adequate vehicle for the expression of their metaphysics and theology. Just so, to take an analagous situation, the early Mesopotamain scribes failed to develop an adequate historical literary genre, in spite of the fact that there is every evidence to show that at least in the second half of the third millennium B. C. some of them had a fairly reliable knowledge of the more important political events of their own generation and to a certain extent even of those which had taken place in earlier times.5 3. Unfortunately both the meaning and reading of IM-dirig, the Sumerian compound word for "cloud," are still uncertain, and so the primary notion behind the word still escapes us, 4. It is to be noted that at least as far as the reviewer's acquaintance with the Su- merian sources is concerned, there is no literary evidence to indicate the existence of the mythopoeic notion that the "Imdugud" bird, representing the black storm, devoured the Bull of Heaven, representing the scorching drought; note, too, that the reading of the word written IM-DUGUD is still uncertain; cf. Thureau-Dangin, RA 24:199ff. and Witzel ZA 40:95. 5. Nor is there reason to believe that future excavations will bring to light texts inscribed with the Sumerian metaphysical and philosophical speculations. For in spite of the fact that the material at our disposal contains but a small fraction of the Sumerian literary remains, it does represent a fair cross-section of Sumerian litera- ture as a whole. And while we do find among them a well developed "wisdom" genre, it is "practical" rather than "theoretical" in character, that is, it consists of compo- sitions devoted to proverbs, fables, and sundry didactic purposes, but does not in- clude any devoted to arguments and discussions concerning the nature of the cosmos 42</page><page sequence="5">burnal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) 43 If we now take several of the more significant cosmogonic concepts of the Sumerians as revealed in their mythopoeic literature at our disposal, it will become quite clear that these could only have resulted from a detached intellectual speculation on the nature of the cosmos whose conponent realms were viewed as inanimate physical entities and not as living "Thou's". Thus we find that the Sumerian thinkers assumed that before the universe came into being there existed nothing but water, that is, they postulated the existence of a primeval sea; 6 that out of this primeval sea there somehow came into and its method of operation. To judge from the present evidence, the best that we may hope for in this direction is to recover at least some of the more significant Sumerian metaphysical and theological conclusions (conclusions, be it noted, but not proofs and arguments) in the introductory lines to some of the myths and epic tales. Unfortunately the relevant passages available to date are relatively few, and even the contents of these few are not infrequently either fragmentary or obscure. 6. In JNES 5: 139 f. it is argued that the sign ENGUR, the sign with which is written the name of the goddess Nammu, "the mother who gave birth to heaven and earth", when read engur, does not mean "sea" but rather "the sweet waters of the subsoil and of pools and marshes"; hence the conclusion that the Sumerians conceived the universe as coming into being in the midst of the primeval sea is unjustified. The reader will note, however, that it is admitted there that to judge from the etymology of the words abzu and a-ab-ba "in a remote past the Sumerians may have distinguished the bodies of water involved less sharply". In other words, at some "remote" time abzu and a-ab-ba could be used more or less interchangeably, and since abzu and engur are "approximately synonymous", it is obvious that entur, too, could be used more or less interchangea- bly with a-ab-ba in the "lremote past". But there is reasonably conclusive evidence that even in later and historical times the words engur, abzu, and a-ab-ba could at times be used interchangeably. Thus we find certain water monsters described as l-ha- ma-engur-ra ninnu-bi, "the fifty lahama of the Engur", in PBS V 25 ii 29 and PBS X 2 No. 1 iii 6; in both cases they are mentioned in connection with Enki. Now the monster of the engur called la-ha-ma, it seems reasonable to assume, is certainly identical on the one hand with the monster described as lahmi A-AIB-BA ut dEa (CT 17:42,25) and with a lahmu monster described as Sut tamtim ga mal u pluhtac (Gray, gamag 20 iv 3) and with the lzhamu-monster who accompanied Tiamat in battle gainst Marduk; on the other hand it is identical with the la--a---abzu of Gudea Cyl. I 24:27. Note finally that in note 21 of JNES 5:139 f., in the case of the six-line passage cited on p. 140, it seems to be argued that a-ab-ba and engur must stand for different entities since they are mentioned in different (though parallel)lines, while on the other hand, engur and abzu are "approximately synonymous" even though these, too, are mentioned in different parallel lines. In short, as far as our available data goes, there is no evidence to indicate, that the Sumerians, like the Akkadians who composed the Enuma elislh epic, divided the sea into a male principle "sweet water" (abau or engur) and female principle "bitter water" (a-ab-ba); the sea was conceived as a single body of water completely surrounding the universe, above, below, and on all sides, and the terms a-ab-ba, engur, and abzu are all more or less synonymous, with a-ab-ba used primarily for the sea as a geographically conceived body of water, (cf. also note 16). Just how the Sumerians explained the existence of "fresh waterl as opposed to "bitter waterl" is not clear, but cf. perhaps SS 1:12, 43ff. where the sweet water is said to come from a KA-a-ki-a-DU.DU; perhaps, too, there is some significance to the fact that it is the sun-god Utu who is ordered by Enki to bring up the sweet water from the earth.</page><page sequence="6">Kramer, Review Of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure being the universe consisting of heaven superimposed over earth and in contact with it, and that later heaven was separated from earth by the atmosphere.7 Now how could the ancient Sumerian thinkers come to the conclusion that first there was the sea and that the universe came into being within it, if not by realizing on the intellectual and rational level that the universe was surrounded by water on all sides, that is, that there was water above the heavens and below the earth as well as all around it?8 Simi- larly why did they pick on the atmosphere as the realm separating heaven from earth, if it were not one again for the realization on the rational level that the atmosphere is actually situated between heaven and earth and that, moreover, unlike these two solid bodies, it consists of a substance which could expand and thus separate two touching surfaces.9 Similarly if we turn to the fundamental theological concepts of the Sumerians, concepts which may be said to formulate the creed and faith, the dogma and doctrine of large parts of the ancient Near East, we find that these, too, originated and de- veloped on the intellectual rlane; they were worked out quite logically and rationally on the analogy of man and his institutions. From as far back as we have written records to the very end of the Mesopotamian civilization, the fundamental metaphysical concept of the theologians, the concept that was central and axiomatic to all their religious speculations, was the assumed existence of a pantheon consisting of a group of living beings, man-like in form, but superhuman and immortal, who though invisible to mortal eye, guide and control the cosmos in accordance with well laid plans and duly prescribed laws. Be it the great cosmic realms heaven and earth, sea and atmosphere, be it the major astral bodies sun, moon, and planet, be it such atmospheric forces as wind, storm and tempest, or finally, to take the earth, be it such natural phenomena as river, mountain, and plain, or such cultural phenomena as city and state, dyke and ditch, field and farm, or even such implements as the pickaxe, brickmold, and plow -- each of these was deemed to be under the charge of one or another anthropomorphic but superhuman being who guided its activities in accordance with established rules and regulations. Now how did the ancient Sumerian thinker come upon this notion of an anthropomor- 7. Cf. SA 37 ff. 8. He thus explained the existence of rain, of wells, pools, and rivers, and of the a- ab-b-a-sit and the cL-ab-ba-gist-im "the lower sea" and "the upper seal, which between them surrounded the earth on all sides. 9. As seen, for example, by any observing Sumerian when blowing up a leather bottle, or in the expansion of the chest upon taking a deep breath of air. 44</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) rphic but surerhuman pantheon in control of the cosmos and its diverse entities and rhenomena? Surely not by notinc any physical resemblance between these latter and human beings; presumably no one will argue that the Mesopotamian, in lookinc up at the sky found it to resemble a hu_e man with a beard, or that in lookin6 down to the earth, saw a huge woman with bulging breasts. Nor is there any reason to believe that the Sumerian thinkers conceived such entities as the sky, earth, sun, moon, river, rickaxe, etc., as "somehow alive" with "wills of their own; 10 all the available evidence clearly indicates that it was not the sky that was thought of as alive, but the human-like being in char5e of the sky; it was not the earth that was thought to be alive, but the human-like bein- in charge of the earth; it was not the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that were alive, but the human-like beinos in charge of these rivers that was alive, etc. etc. And since it is obvious that the Mesonotamian theologian could not Dossibly have seen these human-like beings with his own eyes, we must conclude that he in some way inferred their existence: in other words his reason told him that these bein6s existed even though he was unable to see them. Nor is the basis for this inference hard to fathom; the ancient thinker reasoned quite naturally and logically from the known to the unknown. Taking his cue from human society as he knew it, he noted that all lands and cities. all palaces and temules, all fields and farms, in short all imaginable institutions and enterprises are tended and supervised, ouided and controlled by living human beings: without them, lands and cities become desolate, temples and palaces crumble, field and farm turn to desert and wilderness. Surely therefore the cosmos and all its manifold phenomena must also be tended and supervised, 4uided and controlled, by livini beings in human form. However, the cosmos being far larger than the sum total of human habitations, and its organiza- tion beins far more complex, these living beings must obviously be far larger and stronger than ordinary humans.11 Above all they must be immortal; otherwise the cosmos would turn to chaos upon their death, and the world would come to an end, alternatives which for obvious reasons did not recommend themselves to the Sumerian metaphysician. It was each of these invisible, anthropomorphic, but at the same time superhuman and 10. Cf. Jacobsen on p. 130 of the book under review. 11. In the available literature we have practically no texts revealing the theological speculations concerning the size and strength of the deities in relation to man. But that such speculation was current among the Mesopotamians is obvious from the "birth of a deity" oassages in the myth "Enki and Ninbursag," where it is stated that the goddesses needed only nine days of pregnancy instead of nine months, and that moreover they gave birth without vain (cf. SS 1:12, 77 ff.). 45</page><page sequence="8">Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure immortal beings which the Sumerian designated by the word dingir, which the Akkadians rendered as ilu, and which we translate by the word "i&gt;od. "12 Moreover, Just as the doctrine of the existence of a rantheon develored from what may be termed a common-sense approach to the question "How is the cosmos run?", so, too, did the notions concerning its organization. In the first place it seemed reasonable to the Sumerian theologian to assume that the deities constituting the uantheon were not all of the same importance, or of equal rank. The god in charge of the rickaxe and brickmold could hardly be exnected to compare with the deity in charge of the sun, nor could the deity in charge of dykes and ditches be expected to eaual in rank the god in charge of the earth as a whole. Then, tdo, it seems not,to assume, on analogy with the Dolitical organization of the human state, that at the head of the pantheon was a deity who was recognized by all the others as their king and ruler. And so we find the Sumerian pan- theon conceived as functionin6 as an assembly with a king at its head, the most important grours in this assembly beino the seven gods who "decree the fates" and the fifty deities known as "the great gods. "3 But the most significant division set ur by the Sumerian theologians within their pantheon is that between creative and non-creative deities, a notion arrived at auite rationally as a result of their cosmooonic concepts. For according to these concerts, the basic components of the cosmos are heaven and earth, sea and atmosphere; every other cosmic entityAphenomenon can exist only within one or another of these realms. Hence it was reasonable to infer that the deities in control of heaven and earth, sea and air, were the creatin6 gods; that is, it was one or another of these four gods who created every other cosmic entity in accordance with plans which originated with them. Consequently the heaven-god Anu, the air-od Enlil, the water-god Enki, and the earth-goddess Ninhursag (under the assumption that she represents a goddess once known as Ki), were treated as the four leading deities of the Sumerian pantheon. and are frequently grouped together as a quartette of deities in a class by themselves.14 12. UnfortunatelY the etymology of dinsgir (or better, digir) is still obscure (note that the final syllable gir may be the same as the final gir of kengir "Sumer"), other- wise we might at least have one of the primary notions behind the Sumerian concept of the nature of lgodhood!Y just as for example the word lugal (literally "great man") furnishes an inkling of one of the notions originally associated with king- ship. 13. Cf. Jacobsen's excellent in discussion in JKYES 2:167 ff. 14. Cf. PBS IV 1:24 ff. When it comes to the creation technique attributed to these deities, it is to be noted that once again the Sumerian theologians developed a 46</page><page sequence="9">47 Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) Finally, the Sumerian theologian, again no doubt taking his cue from the human world about him, adduced a significant metaphysical inference in answer to the problem as to what keeps the cosmic entities and phenomena, once created, operating continuously and harmoniously, without conflict and confusion; this is the concept designated by the Sumerian word me whose exact rendering is still not quite certain. To judge from the various contexts, it would seem to denote a set of rules and regulations assigned to each cosmic entity and phenomenon for the very purpose of keeping it operating forever in accordance with the plans laid down by the creating deities.15 The preceding paragraphs, it is hoped, will have brought out clearly the essentially rational character of the Sumerian speculative thought devoted to cosmology and theology. At least this particular ancient man, the early Sumerian metaphysician, must have arrived at his answers to the various cosmological and metaphysical problems con- fronting him, not through revelation "in a reciprocal relationship with nature", but by thinking them out rationally to his intellectual satisfaction. The existence of an invisible, and anthropomorphic but superhuman pantheon organized as a hierarchy toppedby four deities who ruled the four realms of the cosmos and who planned the creation of all other cosmic entities and phenomena within then, and pre- scribed the rules governing their continuous and harronious funct7ioning-- all this was accepted as axioratic by the 'Sumerian philosophers who postu- lated it as a logical inference based on their experience with the civil- ized human world about themr.16Indeed it is not unreasonable to assume that 14 doctrine which became dogma throughout the Near East, that is, the doctrine of the creative power of the divine word. According to this doctrine, all that the creating deity had to do was to lay his plans, utter the word, and it came to be (cf. e.g. such lines as mu-nam-W-1-l6 ba-gar-ra-a-ba in SY 113, the phrase ^-sag5-h-am-ba in AS 12:32, 151, 161; cf. also SS 1:8, note 28b; it is to be noted of course that at least the mythographers are by no means consistent in this matter, and at times make the gods perform some physical activity when doing their creating; cf. e.g. "The Creation of Man" in SI 68 ff.). The notion of the creative power of the divine word, too, is a rational inference; it arose in the mind of the Sumerian theologian in all probability as a result of his observation of the powers of a human king; that is, he reasoned, if the latter could achieve ao much of what he wanted merely by the word of his mouth, how much more so the immortal and superhuman creating deities in charge of the major realms of the universe. 15. Cf. now JNES 5: 139, note 20. 16.To be sure, the metaphysical and theological postulates outlined above represent what may be described as only the central core of their speculations, and that, no doubt, in a highly oversimplified form. Actually these early thinkers who laid down the major lines of the Sumerian theological system, and particularly their later and less creative colleagues, must have evolved many another theological notion ina futile attempt to resolve the inconsistencies and contradictions inherent in a polytheistic system of religion. Moreover, the early Sumerian thinkers must have</page><page sequence="10">48 Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure it was to no small extent precisely bQcause they carried high intellectual conviction that the theological concepts involved in this postulate became the fundamental world view of the early Mesopotamian, his faith and his creed. For while we have no way knowing the fundamental cosmological and theological notions that had preceded them in Mesopotamia, or how close was the resemblance between them, we may well assume that these earlier concepts, whatever their character, had long passed their creative stage. The intellectual superiority of the teaching6s developed and propagated by the Sumerian 16 tried to reconcile at least some of the religious ideas of their predecessors with their own, especially if these were imbedded in ritual practices tending to defy any revolutionary change. Particularly in the matter of the births of the deities and their family interrelationships, the theological systematizer must have run into all sorts of problems and complexities which he no doubt tried to reconcile and explain away in one fashion ot another. But it must be stressed that our present sources unfortunately fail to furnish a clear idea of the speculations underlying these attempts. For the fact is that our basic sources, that is, the myths, hymns, and god- lists, contain genealogical statements which are extremely brief and laconic, and which therefore shed little light on the speculations behind them. Moreover they nearly all stem from a relatively late date when theological speculation had been rife for centuries, and after Sumer had undergone a number of political changes which left their deep, if largely unrecognizable imprint on these divine genealogies. Thus, for example, the goddess Nammu is stated to be "the mother who gave birth to heaven and earth" (cf. SAf 39); Nammu was thus presumably the mother of the heaven- god Anu and the earth-goddess Ki. But in the god lists she seems to be treated as one of the deities in the circle of Anu (cf. IRS 10:29-37 and CT 24: 122 ff. = ibid, 20: 15ff.); it is not clear just what the relationship is, but it certainly does not seem to that of a mother. Moreover, going on assumption that reason demanded the existence of a father as well as mother for the birth of offspring (and the fact that such words for sea as a-ab-ba, abzu and ab all contain the element ab "father" indicates clearly that there was a god as well as a goddess of the primeval sea), who was the deity? To be sure Enlil is given the name, or better the epithet, ab in the god-lists (cf. e.g. TRS 10:41; CT 24:22, 98), but it seems hardly likely that Enlil, who at least in historical times has nothing to do with the sea, is to be identified with the ab in a-ab-ba and ab-zu; note too, if that should be the case it would be necessary to assume that Enlil was conceived by the theologians as the father of Anu and Ki. In historical times, it vas of course Enki who was conceived as the lord of.the sea; cf. particularly the passage cited in JNES 5:140 which in- dicates clearly that he was the ruler of the abzu, engur, a-ab-ba as well as the i(d- mah and the buranun. In the god-lists and in the myths, however, he is stated to be the son of Nammu, not the husband. What moreover is intended with the well-known mentioned at all (cf. now JNES 5:138-9)? Similarly it seems reasonable to conclude that the goddess Ki "earth" was identical with Ninhursag of the historical periods. Put if that is the case she might be expected to have been the mother of Enlil and the husband of Anu since Anu was probably conceived as his (i.e. Enlil's) father (cf. the often quoted SAK 154:3, 16). And yet this is hardly borne out by our texts, which regularly designate her husband as ?ulpae. On the other hand, in the case of many deities, their parentage seems well established in historical times. Thus Nergal, Ninurta, and Nanna are everywhere conceived as the sons of Enlil; Utu and Ianna are the children of Nanna and Ningal; Iskur, Martu, and Bau (the readings Babu and Baba may be phonetic variants only) are everywhere stated to be the children of Anu, etc. etc.</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) thinkers was therefore all the more apparent, and their wholehearted acceptance by the ruling caste was more or less inevitable, particularly since it is not unlikely that these Sumerian thinkers were at the same time temple and court officials of high in- fluence. Just so for example, the acceptance of the monotheistic teachings developed and propagated by the Hebrew thinkers of a much later day was due to no small extent to their intellectual superiority over the earlier polytheistic notions which had long lost their creative vigor. Now there can be little doubt that the early Sumerian thinkers responsible for the basic metaphysical and theological concepts prevailing in Mesopotamia during the third millennium B.C. had evolved and formulated them only after considerable discussion and debate among themselves. Moreover, since they were convinced that they were in possess- ion of profound cosmic truths of utmost importance to their own conduct and that of their fellow beings, they no doubt propagated them zealously and fervently by word of mouth in order to have them accepted as the official and universal faith of the land; they must therefore have formulated and utilized many an argument and proof for their support. But, as already pointed out, there is little likelihood that we will ever re- cover the contents of these arguments and discussions, since the Sumerian scribes and men of letters failed to develop a written literary genre to serve as a vehicle for their expression and conservation. All that we can hope is to dig out and piece together a few of the conclusions-- not the reasons and arguments supporting them-- from the Sumerian texts of a much later day, particularly from their myths, a literary genre popular with the Sumerian scribes functioning in the Edubba. But in doing so, it is all-important to bear in mind that the Mesopotamian mythographers were not primarily philosophers and theologians interested in speculative thought, but rather scribes and poets whose main concern wasll the lorification and exaltation of the gods and their deeds. 17 Unlike the former these mythographers were not interested in discovering new cosmological and theological truths; they accepted the current theological notions and practices without any real insight into their orioin and 6rowth. 17 The forerunners and prototypes of the Sumerian mythographers are not to be sought among the early thinkers and philosophers, that group of influential palace and temple officials who probably evolved the basic lines of Sumerian metaphysics and theology, but rather among the poets and minstrels who from earliest days had com- posed and recited oral lays in honor of the heroes, and probably also of the gods, in order to entertain their lordly and courtly audience; cf. PAPS 90: 120 ff. 49</page><page sequence="12">Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure Their aim was to compose a narrative poem in which they attempted to explain the origin and being of one or another of these notions and practices in a manner that would prove to be appealin5, inspiring, and entertainin6. That is, they were not concerned with proofs and arguments which appeal to the intellect; their first interest was in tellin6 a story or in describing an event which would appeal primarily to the emotions. 18 They therefore did not resort to logic and reason as their literary tools, but to ima6ination and fantasy. Consequently, in telling their story or in describing the particular event, these poets did not hesitate to invent motives and incidents patterned on human action which could not ipossibly have any basis in reasonable speculative thought, nor did they hesitate to adopt legendary and folkloristic motifs that had nothing to do with rational cosmological inouiry and inference.19 To assume that these Mesopotamian myths are representative of the speculative thought of the early philosophers and theologians who developed the basic lines of Sumerian cosmology and theology, is as fallacious as it would be to assume that the myths and lesends collected in the Haggadic portions of the Talmud and in the Midrashim are representative of the early Hebrew thinkers who evolved and taught the concept of monotheism.20 Turning now to Jacobsen's most important chapter on Mesopotamian speculative thought, "The Cosmos as a State", one cannot but admire and applaud the care and thoughtfulness with which it is written, the logic of its organization, the devotion to minute detail, the lucidity of its statements and summations. Indeed all who have 18 That the scribes themselves were conscious of this, their main aim, is indicated by the fact that the myths regularly end with the word z-c-sal immediately preceded by the name of the deity who is the main protagonist of the myth. This is exactly the the same phrase that regularly comes at the end of the epic tales, indicating clearly that the underlying attitude on the part of the scribes and poets was the same for myth and epic. Similarly, royal songs of praise were regularly composed in the 6-dub-ba, cf. especially TRS CLV v 27 ff. 19 In SS 1:7 I was wrong in stating that "by and large the poet is translating into mythological language the results of his contemplation and speculation on certain natural phenomena involved in the agricultural life about him;" cf. the sentence preceding this quotation where the word l"somel" might better have read 1most. 20 On page 8 of the book under review, the character of myth is summarized as follows: "Myth is a form of poetry which transcends poetry in that it proclaims a truth; a form of reasoning which transcends reasoning in that it wants to bring about the truth it proclaims; a form of action, of ritual behaviour, which does not find its fulfilment in the act but must proclaim and elaborate a poetic form of truth." If the authors intend this definition of myth to be taken seriously -- and they have of course every right to define the term in their own way -- not a single one of the Sumerian myths should have been included in the book, since they hardly qualify on any of the three counts Particularly there is not the slightest evidence whatever that the Sumerian myth, as we have it, was "a form of action, of ritual behaviorl; it was nothing more than a literary genre developed by the scribe in his 6-dub-ba, comparable to the epic tale and the "wisdom" literature (cf. also JCS 1:6, note 3d). 50</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) followed Jacobsen's contributions in the past decade, particularly those in the Sumeri;trl field, havs learned to reco6nize and appreciate their funda.mental importance and significance. It is particularly obvious from his published work that he has devoted much time and thought to the Sumerian literary material; his relevant studies will take their place among the most original and stimulatin5 in the field.21 In spite of all this, however, I regret to say that I find myself in disagreement with most of his generalizations and conclusions on Mesopotamian speculative thought as stated in this chapter. For they are erounded on two ma.jor fallacies: (1) he attributes to the early Sumerian thinkers a psychological attitude towards the phenomena of nature which they never had, and (2) by failing to realize the true character of the purpose and techni- cues of the mythographers he reads into their works cosmological speculations of a rational and logical character which they never intended. To follow the ar~ument more clearly let us analyze this chapter section by section, omitting only the first, on the influence of environment in Egypt and Mesopotamia, which is primarily introductory and summary in character. In the second section, "Date of the Mesopotamian View of the WTorld", we find the rather startling statement that with the advent of the Froto-literate period, Mesopotamian civilization crystallized, "as it were, overnight." Thus, it is stated, "the fundamental pattern, the controlling framework within which Mesopotamia is to live its life, formulate its deepest cuestions, evaluate itself and evaluate the universe, for a6es to come,.flashes into being, complete in all its main features" (p. 128). Now this hypothesis of the overnight crystallization of Mesopotamian civilization -- and it is to be borne constantly in mind that all statements concerning prehistoric MesoTotamia, including the one presented in the lines that follow, can, in the nature of things, be nothing other than hypothetical inferences and theories -- seems to be neither readily justifiable not highly illuminating. An hypothesis which seems to conform more to the evidence on hand and which promises a more productive approach to the problems involved, 21 Cf. particularly his review article of SM in JNES 5:128-152 where he takes issue -- and in more than one instance quite rightly -- with a number of its translations and conclusions. However, except for several examples pertinent to this review, it is preferable to leave the detailed discussions to the time when the scientific editions of the relevant poems will be made available in order that the reader might be able to follow the arguments with the full extant text before him. But this is a good opportunity to mention one major correction made by Jacobsen. In sketching the con- tents of the poem lugal-e-u4-me- dm-bi-nir-gdI I was quite wrong in assuming that Ninurta's struggle was against Kur (that is, kur personified) as a whole, rather than against the Asakku who was one of the fierce demons who dwelt in the kur. 51</page><page sequence="14">Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure is the following. The crystallization of Mesopotamian civilization as known in early historic days, that civilization in which, to judge from linguistic testimony, the Sumerians played a predominant role, began to take place in the course of the Proto- literate period as the result of a long era of cultural cross-fertilization involving at least three ethnic groups. Thus, long before the Sumerians arrived on the scene, life in Lower Mesopotamia began as a peasant-village culture introduced by a still un- identifiable ethnic group that was probably neither Semitic nor Sumerian in origin. Following a period of infiltration and invasion by the Semites from the west, this peasant-village culture developed over the centuries into a high urban civilization which, on the political level, reached at times empire proportions. The political sway of this predominantly Semitic Mesopotamian empire was brought to an end by the primitive Sumerian hordes after a protracted military struggle which ended in the invasion of Lower Mesopotamia by the Sumerian conquerors. As a result of this invasion and conquest, Lower Mesopotamia suffered a period of stagnation and regression culminating in the relatively barbaric and immature Heroic Age.22 It is the period following on the Sumerian Heroic Age which witnessed a rather unusually fruitful cultural fusion between the barbaric Sumerian conquerors and the originally far more civilized native population. Particularly this was the period that probably witnessed the invention of the Sumerian system of writing, and produced a group of administrators and intellectuals in the temples and palaces, under whose productive leadership the later historic Mesopotamian civilization, with its predominantly Sumerian stamp, began to crystallize.23 Turning to the next section in the chapter, "The Mesopotamian Attitude Toward the Phenomena of Nature," it is to be noted that its fundamental conclusion is largely unfounded and invalid; it was arrived at by ascribing to speculative thought the views and notions characteristic of magic and myth. Thus we find there such statements as "any phenomenon which the Mesopotamian met in the world around him was thus alive, had its own personality and will, its distinct self," or that the Mesopotamian actually spoke "of stones and stars, winds and waters, as citizens and as members of legislative assemblies." Now whatever their validity for the incantation priest and mythographer, there is not the slightest evidence that such views were held by the early Sumerian 22 This is the period of Enmerkar-Lugalbanda'Gilgame* whose political organization is characterized by Jacobsen as "primitive mocrac f. especially JXE 2:165ff.aS 23 The hypothesis outlined above, together with the evidence on which it is based, is developed in detail in a study to appear in the near future in the JA. 52</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) thinkers who believed in the existence of an invisible, anthropomorphic pantheon in control of the cosmos and all its varied phenomena. These men did not confuse the animate with the inanimate; they certainly looked upon air and water, reed and tree, metal and stone, as lifeless objects without personality and without will. Similarly, the four realms which made up the Sumerian cosmos, heaven and earth, sea and atmosphere, were not conceived by the Sumerian metaphysicians as animate; there were animate beings in them, such as deities, men, animals, but the physical realms themselves were not thought of as having life, will, or personality.24 Indeed it is no doubt just because the cosmos was, as far as they could see, predominantly inanimate, without will and intelligence, that these early thinkers found themselves confronted with their basic problem, that is, how could the lifeless, unintelligent entities which comprise the cosmos function consistent- ly and harmoniously, day after day, year after year, generation after generation; surely, they inferred, they must be watched over and controlled by powerful living creatures filled with profound wisdom and understanding. In short the very idea of the existence of a pantheon such as that described in the preceding pages would never have come to the Mesopotamian thinker had he not made the distinction between animate and inanimate. In the following sections of the chapter, devoted to a discussion of the structure of the cosmic state, and to its leaders, we unfortunately find repeated again and again the same unfounded generalizations concerning the animate character of all cosmic entities and phenomena, But, in addition, these pages reveal a number of misconceptions with regard to the leading Sumerian deities based largely on some rather extraordinary and,at least to my mind, far-fetched psychological analyses of a purely subjective character.25 Thus, after considerable speculation on how the sky affects man when "in a singularly receptive mood," it is concluded that the Mesopotamians took Anu to represent "majesty and absolute authority," while Enlil, on the other hand, is interpreted as the god of storm, and so is said to represent force. Thus, the argument continues, while Anu runs the universe by authority alone, authority which is freely and voluntarily accepted, it is Enlil who takes the stage when force enters the picture. In other words we are 24 Note that even Jacobsen admits that the sky could be conceived apart from the deity and that then "it receded into the category of things and became a mere abode for the god" (p. 138). 25 Cf. e.g. the following statement in connection with the assumed effect of the majesty of the sky on man: "Beyond all, however, the experience of majesty is the experience of power, of power bordering on the tremendous, but power at rest, not consciously imposing its will. The power behind majesty is so great that it need not exert itself. Without any effort on its part it commands allegiance by its very presence; the on- looker obeys freely, through a categorical imperative rising from the depths of his his own soul" (p. 138). 53</page><page sequence="16">Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure evidently to assume that the Sumerian pantheon was conceived as ruled at the same time by two supreme deities whose powers complemented one other: by Anu, who exercised authority without force, and by Enlil, who supplied the force when necessary. Now this theory of a division of power between Anu and Enlil hardly conforms to the available evidence. In the first place, as will soon become evident, Enlil is not the god of the storm at all; hence his function in the universe is not to be understood primarily in terms of violence and force. Moreover, if we go back to the earliest historical period, that is approximately the middle of the third millennium B.C., it is generally agreed that it was Enlil alone who was then conceived as the supreme ruler of the universe, supreme, that is, from the point of view of authority as well as force. To be sure -- and this is what may have influenced Jacobsen's conclusions -- in the Sumerian texts we do frequently find the two deities coupled together in the order Anu, Enlil. But this is probably due to the fact that at one time, in prehistoric days, it was Anu who was conceived as the supreme ruler of the universe, and it was perhaps as a result of some important but still unknown political event that this supremecy was turned over to Enlil, just as in a much later day it was transferred from Enlil to Marduk.26 In any case, whoever it was that was conceived as the supreme deity in a given period, he was thought of as supreme in force as well as authority. Returning to the god Enlil, it is most unfortunate that Jacobsen continues the misconceptions in the interpretation of his name and character which have long tended to dominate cuneiform literature.27 Actually Enlil was conceived in historical times not only as the supreme ruler of the pantheon, but as a most beneficent deity who was responsible for much of the planning and creating of the most productive features of the cosmos.28 What has misled some scholars into assuming that he was primarily a god of violence and destruction is, in the first place, a mistranslation of the word Ltl as "storm"; actually it is to be rendered as "wind," "air," "spirit," andAhas to a certain extent the same semantic range as the Hebrew rcach.29 Secondly, because it so happened that among the earliest Sumerian compositions published there was to be found an un- usually large proportion of lamentations, particularly of the "enem" type,30 scholars tended to conclude that Enlil was by nature violent and destructive, and that his "word" 26 Cf. especially PBS X 4:36ff. 27 Cf. e.g. Notscher in RLA II 384-5; Dhorme, Les Religions de Bbylonie et d'ssyrie 27. 28 Cf.

What they seemed to fail to realize was that it is only in lamnentations that Enlil is so pictured, and for obvious reasons. For the destruction which gave rise to the lamentation was due to the desision of the gods, and since Enlil was the supreme leity who had the final say in this decision, it was he who had the unhappy duty of carrying out the decreed destruction.31 If on the other hand we take the hymns and the myths, we find that Enlil is glorified as a friendly and fatherly deity who watches over that safety and well-being of Sumer in particular, and who brings destruction to its enemies. 32 As for the sections devoted to the deities Ninhursag and Enki, these, too, contain a number of highly speculative and largely subjective analyses and assumptions with regard to the Mesopotamian mind which, according to the author, gained its understanding of the earth "in direct experience of it as inner will and direction." Moreover, in the case of Enki, there are a number of problems crucial to any attempt to get at the origin of the god and his name which seem to be ignored altogether. Thus unlike an and en-Lit, the name en-ki is a genitive complex33 and may therefore actually be an epithet which was substituted for the real name of the deity, just as for instance the epithet (n)in-an-na was substituted for the Semitic name IStar, and the epithet nin-hur-sag-gd may have been substituted for a more original name Ki. Secondly, why should a deity who is 31 Note particularly that Jacobsen, too, uses the lamentation as his basic source for the conclusion that Enlil is a wild and raging deity; actually the texts cited on p. 141ff. only say that Enlil called such violent forces as the storm and evil wind, the tempest and fire, as agents to carry out the destruction decreed by the gods, and nowhere in the texts is Enlil identified with any of these forces. Note, too, that the last citation from SBH on p. 144 which is claimed to reveal Enlil's rage as "almost patho- logical, an inner turmoil of the soul which render, him insensate, inaccessible to all appeals", might well be taken by those less prejudiced against Enlil to indicate just the opposite, that is, that he is really a "softy" at heart. For he has to close his heart and seal his ears in order to avoid the pleas and prayers directed to him since otherwise he might be moved to pity and thus find it impossible to carry out his repugnant but obligatory task. t ntr 32 There are two additional sources of error which have *isled scholars in the inter- pretation of the character of Enlil: (1) the phrase lugal-a- ma-ru-d en,- d (Gudea Cyl. A 12:2 and 23:14) was taken to refer to Enlil (cf. Paffrath, Gdtterlehre 116; Dhorme, op. cit. 27) when it actually refers to Ningirsu; and (2) the composition published in CT 15:11-12 has been taken by some scholars to be an Enlil hymn because of its colophon, although nearly every line of its contents indicates clearly that it is a Ninurta hymn (cf. Zimmern in VS II p. VIII; Notscher in RLA II 384; note, too, Meissner's statement in Bab. und Assyrien 155). As for the colophon which reads fr-- m-a-a-den- l{-d-kam, either the name Enlil is a scribal oversight for Ninurta, or perhaps it was chosen because Ninurta belongs to the Enlil circle of deities, although to date I know no other example in Sumerian literature which indicates such a scribal practice. 33 Cf. the iiumerable examples of the subject form en-ki-ke~.</page><page sequence="18">Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure primarily conceived as a water-god be given the name en-ki, which, at least on the surface, certainly can only mean "lord of the earth" and not "lord of the waters"?34 This title "lord of the earth" seems to indicate that he was impinging to some extent on the authority of Enlil who "had carried off the earth" after its separation from heaven.35 Finally there is the fact that, unlike Anu and Enlil, Enki, at least toward the very end of the third millenium, has a Semitic name, that is, Ea.36 Just what all these facts add up to is by no means easy to fathom; perhaps they point to the possibility that the water-god Ea-Enki was originally a Semitic deity who at a very early period was adopted and fitted into the Sumerian pantheon under the name en-ki, as a result of the growing political importance of his worshippers. Turning finally to the section in the chapter dealing with the Sumerian myths selected by the author to illustrate the Mesopotamian world view, it is all-important that the reader bear in mind this rather unusual anomaly, that while on the whole the translations of the cited passages show great care in linguistic detail and keen insight into the meaning of the text -- in not a few cases, as I shall have occasion to point out here and in future studies, Jacobsen has penetrated the meaning of the original where I have failed to do so -- the accompanying analyses of the contents of the myth as a whole, on the other hand, are highly speculative and far from trustworthy; they attempt to read into the myths cosmological notions and psychological motives which their authors never intended.37 In the following paragraphs, therefore, it is only the actual translations of the cited passages which will be analyzed, particularly where a difference of opinion in regard to the meaning of the text is crucial to the meaning of the understanding of the myth as a whole. First, then, the myth of Enlil and Ninlil, which tells of the begetting of Nanna and his three underworld brothers. The major point of difference between the version of the myth presented here and that outlined in SM 43 ff., consists of the introduction of 34 On the character of Enki as the lord of all bodies of water, salt and fresh, cf. notes 6 and 16. But even if Enki should be considered as god of the sweet waters only, there is still"reason to call him lord of the earth; a title such as ra would seem more appropriate on the view that engur and abzu stand only for the sweet waters. 35 Cf. S 10:3,t . Note, too, that the text published in JAOS 63:191 ff. seems to in- dicate a conflict between Enlil and Enki, and one in whch the latter seems to have been victorious to a certain extent. 36 Cf RLI II 375. That Ea is a Semitic word seems to be proved by the fact that in proper names it is combined regularly with Semitic elements only. 37 Cf. particularly pp. 155-9 and p. 168 of the book under review; for the basic mis- conception of the nature of the Sumerian myths, cf. p. ff. of this review. 56</page><page sequence="19">Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) 57 the motif of the rape of Ninlil by Enlil, and the consequent arrest of the latter and his banishment to the nether world. Now the passage describing the seizure of Enlil by the gods and his banishment offers but little difficulty, although, as far as I know, Jacobsen is the first to have gathered its real meaning and import.38 On the other hand, the motive for the seizure and banishment of Enlil, which Jacobsen concludes to be the rape of Ninlil, is, unless I am very much mistaken, based on an erroneous translation of the relevant lines; it renders as negatives two verbal forms which should be rendered as positives, and interprets one of the crucial lines as an exclamatory question implying a negative answer, when it is actually a straight declarative sentence. In short, as the translation in SM 44 indicates, not only is there no question of Ninlil's being raped by Enlil, on the contrary, at the instigation of her mother, Ninlil sets the trap and gets her man.39 38 Jacobsern's transliteration and translation of the passage will be found in JNES 5:132- 3, note 9. It is to be noted, however, that the translation of the verb ba-ra-' in lines 6 and 7 of the passage as "will leavel is unjustified since it should then read ba-ra-A-dg; the rendering of ba-ra-0 is "he left." These two lines, therefore, are not part of a direct discourse attributed to the gods, as indeed is also indicated to a certain extent by the fact that there is no statement in the text designating these two lines as the words of the deities. 39 The passage reads as follows (cf. BBI pl. VIII 13ff. and particularly the photograph on pl. XXXII of the same work or on pl.

The reader is now in a position to follow the text with transliteration, translation, and commentary in SS No. 1; whatever differences in translation and interpretation are found'in the work under review will have to await Jacobsen's future linguistic documentation.40 39 proferred instructions she at the same time gave heed" (for SI with the meaning "at the same time," cf. GSG 406 and AS 10:18, note 49); the "at the same time" probably refers to Ninlil's action as described in the preceding line 9 of the passage whose meaning is obcsure, and whose word division is largely a matter of guesswork and may turn out to be quite incorrect, but whose initial words VS-hl-ia "joyous heart" (or perhaps lwith joyous heart") tend to indicate that Ninlil was only too happy to carry out her mother's instructions. Jacobsen, however, having concluded that the motive for the seizure of Enlil by the gods is rape, renders the lines as an exclamatory question implying a negative answer, a translation that, as far as I am aware, is unparalleled and unjustified. Several other points to be noted are (1) the rendering "climb" for the verbal forms in lines 4 and 12 of the passage seems to be based on the reading gub of the sign DU, a reading which seems unlikely since the verbal form would then have ended in -gub-bu-ce rather than - DU-d}; (2) the translation "he will embrace thee" for mu-bi dm-i-i (line 8 of the passage) must be a guess based on the context; as far as I am aware there is no lexicographical evidence to support it; (3) Jacobsen's render- ing "woman" for the nunuz-e of line 3 of the passage is of course preferable to "maid"; note the interesting fact that the Emesal writes nunuz for the Eme-KU munus; (4) the translation "forthwith" for adalam in line 8 of the passage is quite justified fied; it was an error to omit it in SM. As for the positive statement that follows the translation on p. 153, that "Enlil sees Ninlil, tries to seduce her, and when she refuses, takes her by force," it is to be carefully noted that except for Enlil's catching sight of Ninlil, the evidence for this statement is far from assured; it seems to be based on BBI 4 i 28-9 which may perhaps be restored to read: [lugal-e NE]-b.i-e .inim mu-na-ab-b.i nu-da-ra-- i-.ib-ge-gi [de.n- i ll]-li NE-bi-e inim mu-na-ab-bi nu-un-[da-ra-iib-?e- ,i tCthe king] .... says a word to her (but) she is unwilling, [Enlil] .... says a word to her (but) she is unwilling" (for the -da-ra- cf. S 12:79 comment to line 85). From there on, as can be seen from the photograh of the tablet, the text is destroyed either wholly or in part for about fifteen lines, and there is nothing to indicate that Enlil attacked Ninlil and raped her. Finally in the case of the passage translated on p. 154 (beginning with the lines "Enlil calls unto the gatekeeper") it will be noted that its first line cor- responds to line 5 of the first-cited passage in SR 45, that they then correspond except for relatively minor deviations in the renderings for the next five lines, but that from there on they diverge almost entirely. This is due to the fact that acob- sen follows here the text of the bilingual published in JRAS 62:191, 16-end while the translation in S1M follows BBI 4 ii 26 ff. and several unpublished duplicates (cf. SM 114, note 48 where SEI 76 is to be added). Moreover, it is to be noted that the bilingual shows a confused text at this point, since lines 17-18 of its reverse are written in the Emesal, although according to line 16 it is Enlil, not Ninlil, who is speaking. Also to be noted is the fact that the renderings "Thou shalt, O man, not embrace, thou shalt, 0 man, not kiss" (for JRAS 62:191,21) and "Has Enlil shown favor (for .ib.id., line 23) are hardly justified by the text, and are no doubt based on the context. 40 For an attempt to justify the translation of the first four linesof the myth, cf. JNES 5:131, note 7; it seems to me to fail for the following reasons: (1) According to this translation (cf. especially the statement at the very end of the note which</page><page sequence="21">Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) 59 Following a brief sketch of the myth devoted to Enki and the organization of the universe, which in the main agrees with the outline of the myth to be found in SM 6 ff., the chapter continues with the myth devoted to the creation of man, in which Enki and Nirmah are the major protagonists. As the reader will note, the version given in this chapter and that to be found in SR agree closely up to the point where Enki starts tbe creating; from there on the divergence between the two versions is quite considerable. But since, in spite of a renewed and careful study of the available text of the myth, I am still unable to find little to justify Jacobsen's statements with regard to the second half of the myth, it will be wiser to await his detailed linguistic analysis before reaching a definite conclusion.41 The last Sumerian myth42 treated in this chapter concerns the wooing of Inanna by the shepherd-god Dumuzi; its contents are outlined in Sk 101-3. A comparison of the two versions reveals once again that while there is considerable agreement with regard to the earlier portions of the myth, they differ radically in the interpretstion of tile contents of the latter half of the myth. A renewed study of the text shows that while 40 refers to the publication of SS 1; it indicates that the translation for the first and third lines should be identical, since even in the first line the adjective following ki is kug, not Sikil) lines 1 and 2 are identical in reading with lines 3 and 4; in view of what is known of Sumerian poetry, it is much more likely that line 1 begins with a word of general meaning such as ki "place" while line 3 begins with a word which actually names the place intended (note, too, that the break at the beginning of lines 2 and 4 seems to be too large for the restoration of the sign KUR alone, unless it be assumed that these lines are indented, in which case they should of course not be numbered separately). (2) Jacobsen's translation of the second half of lines 1 and 3 has a forced ring which is difficult to pin down; particularly it seems rather unlikely that the -ba- is here used with the meaning "divide". Finally, there is one other point worth mentioning in connection with this myth: Jacobsen was quite right in pointing out in JNES 5:143 that I omitted a reference to Scheil in which it is shown that the goddess Uttu had something to do with clothing rather than plants. However it is difficult to see how this justifies the statement there made that "the greater part of the myth of Enki and Ninbursagga(sic!) is fatally obscured"; indeed the outline of the story of the myth in the book under review agrees to a very large extent with that in Sk and in SS 1. 41 Particularly doubtful is the correctness of the statement that Enki fashioned tzvo creatures; the relevant text seems to have room for the creation of only one creature. Far from certain, too, is the assumption that the phrase ud4-mU--l represents the name given by Enki to the creature he created, and quite doubtful, too, of course is its assumed meaning tmy day is remote," and the resulting conclusion that it was he who "brought into the world sickness and all other miseries attendant upon old age." In fact, the reader will do well to note that, for the present at least, the final part of^myth is still basically and tantalizingly unintelligible. 42 The chapter does not end, however, with this Sumerian myth; it concludes with a de- tailed analysis of the Akkadian poem Enuma eLish. In the case of this myth, too, an excellent translation is marred by unjustifiable interpretations attributing to the authors of the myth theological and cosmological speculations which they never in- tended.</page><page sequence="22">Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure Jacobsen has seen penetratingly in several places where I failed to see, particularly in the first half of the text, he has seriously misinterpreted the latter half. However, as will soon become apparent, even the SR version of this part of the myth now needs considerable revision. Fortunately the major part of the text of the myth is extant and available in published form, and the following transliteration and translation should make it possible for the cuneiformist to make his own decision in the crucial cases.43 Transliteration It-ki-siki t2r .... 2. ki-. ab-s.(n-na-GAM-GAM e(?) .... 4. di ttg5(?) .... 6. in-, ...-DU nu-me-en NE .... 8. .... dam-s.i0ad-da ....

In line 6, the epithet in-ffn, which superficiallY seems to be a play on the name of Inanna, is found used not only of Inanna (cf. e,.g. SLT'X 13:1, rBS X 4 No. 9 obv. 24 (-in(I)-nin); PBS XII 47 obv. 8; ibid. rev. 12 (in-nfn(!)); SRT' 1 i 16). but also of Ninisinna, cf. SRT 6 ii 32 ( ibid. 7:7). 76 Lines 10-19. A comparison of the new translation with that in Si shows a number of significant changes due primarily to Jacobsen's fruitful efforts, particularly his insight into the grammatical structure of the passage. Thus he noted that hI&amp;-tuhku- thku, in lines 12 and 16, is a finite verb whose subject follows rather than precedes</page><page sequence="26">64 Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure 11. Says to the pure Inanna: 12. "0 my sister, let the shepherd marry thee, 13. 0 maid Inanna, why art thou unwilling? 14. His fat is good, his milk is good, 15. The shepherd, everything his hand touches is bright, 16. OInanna, let the shepherd Dumuzi marry thee, 17. 0 thou who ...., why art thou unwilling? 18. His good fat he will eat with thee, 19. 0 ptotector of the king, why art thou unwilling?" 1C. "[ie] the shepherd shall not marry,77 21. In his new [garment] he shallno tdrape me, 22. Khen 'I .... he shall not .. me, 23. Me, the maid, let the farmer marry, 24. The farmer who makes plants grow abundantly, 25. The farmer who makes grain grow abundantly, 76 it. Again in lines 20-23 he noted that the final -en (-un, -an) is the accusative particle of the first person singular added to the third person singular present- future of the verb. This seems to be contrary to the conclusion reached in AS 10:30 where the form ba-e-db-b.i "it will seize thee" indicates that the accusative pro- nominal element when added to a third person singular present future precedes the root, unless of course we assume that the accusative second person singular pronominal element is treated differently from the accusative first person pronominal element. Note that &amp;J-tuku-tuku "let (him) marry thee" of lines 12 and 16 when compared with de-mu-ttuku-tukuut n "let (him) marry me" (line 23) seems to point in the same direction (perhaps, too, the variant be-e- for he-, in line 16, is significant, that is, the -e- is the accusative second person singular pronominal element). In line 14, the trans- lation follows Jacobsen in reading ga 'tilk" (as in B) rather than ka? "date-wine" (as in A, where it may be a miscopy); it is milk, not date-wine, which is the shepherd's major product. On the other hand, it seems preferable to translate .id as 'fat' rather than "butter" since the latter is regularly lidn. In line6 note the rather un- expected Emesal writing for Dumuzi (in A only: B has the Eme-KU form; cf. note 47); so, too, the writing su8-ba for s$iad in lines 12 and 15 (cf. also lines 73 and 74) seems unjustified. For the restoration of uni- in line 17, cf. e. g. SRT 6 ii 29, 33 (.ib,id. 7:4-8); the meaning of untl-ld--ubZa-4 which seems to be used here as an epithet if Inanna (it parallels the ki-sjikil of line 13 and the an-dile-ugzal-la of line 19) is obscure. In line 19, if the translation of an-dl-e-lAgal-la proves correct, the -e- following -dtl- is inexplicable. 77.Lines 20-34. In line 21, the translation follows the text in A: the gloss in B is not clear to me. In line 22, the translation follows the text inA (in Si the translation followed the text in B and assumed that -gib.iL- is to be restored before -Id-). Jacobsen's translation seems to follow the gloss in B (note, however, that only the word ,i$dti?u is certain and that therefore the first sign in B obv. 15 is perhaps to be restored as s.{g). The verb in line 22 is left untranslated, since there seems to be no lexicographical indication as to its meaning. In lines 24-5, the translation assumes that gin-gZn-a-da is the grammatical gun-gun-ed-d1; it is to be noted, however, that</page><page sequence="27">Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) 65 2e . .

Note finally that in line 24, Jacobsen's translation of gu as "beans" seems to assume that it is synonymous with gti of line 59. Line 34, if the restoration me-e proves correct, is written in the Emesal, and may therefore mark the end of Inanna'a answer to Utu. 78 Lines 35-39. These lines are too fragmentary for constructive comment. Note that line 38 may be written in the Emesal; cf., however, note 76 for evidence that the writings su8-ba and dt*mu-z.i are not conclusive criteria for Emesal orthography, particularly in the case of A. 79 Lines 40-64. In line 40 (also lines 42 and 64) note the idiomatic use of the post- position -ra with the verb dirig. For the rendering e (line 41) as "dyke" cf. i- particularly Thureau-Dangin in RA 34:179; -apin-ke4 is for the grammatical apin-(a)k- ; e, and might have been expected to be written apin-na-ke . Note that lines 41-2 are F erroneously omitted from the translation in Sl 102. The new rendering of lines 43ff. 4 indicates more clearly than the SM translation the force of the ha- and the ga- of g,the verbal forms. In lines 44 and 46, Jacobsen's "wool" seems to indicate a misread- ' ing S{g for ganam. In line 47, Jacobsen's "prime" for sag is preferable to "first" I in SM; for the meaning of ka?, cf. Poebel in Z _39:146 ff. For the rendering l "stultifying" cf sd-gi -a in line 51, cf. ?L 261:112; the erroneous translation in I Sk is due to a confusion with Ia-gi4-a. As for the BU5 in ga-BU5 of line 52, it might perhaps be expected to have a meaning corresponding to that of sd-g.i -a of the 3P 4. o preceding line; the rendering "bubbling" Si was a guess based on such equations as MU5 = napahu, and should have been indicated as highly doubtful. In Line 55, ha-ha-la j.du -Id with gt while in line 60 tur-tur seems to be used with exactly the same meaning after ga-HUJR. In lines 61-3, note that the new rendering differs considerably from that in Si; it translates i--mu-ni-ki and 4-mtu-i-nag as first rather than third ? person verbal forms; still obscure is the nuance intended by the -ni- of these forms. -For the meaning of line 61, cf. kurun-n(g-dilg i-m-un-nag-eS-[a-ta] ka?#nfg-ditg 'i- mu,-un-dig-g.i-eS-a-t[a]a-kdr--ar-ra du4 mi-ni-ib-mn-nI[i-n]e "[After] they (i.e. ',Lahar and Agnan)'had drunk the good wine, [af]ter they had imb.ibed the good date- wine, they start a quarrel in the meadows" (cf.

Line 71 is so fragmentary that it is difficult to fit into the context; it is to be noted, however, that ddumu-i is not followed by the subject element and that therefore if it is the subject (it may of course be a direct object) the verb must again be intransitive. Note the new renderings for lines 72-3; particularly important is the fact that they are not part of Enkimdu's address as taken in SY where the rendering for edin was omitted alto- gether, while a-na was assumed to be the interrogative pronoun. For the meaning of line 73, cf. the passage cited toward the end of note 79. Just what the implication of "in his plain" (as opposed to the "river-bank" of the preceding lines) is, is not clear; perhaps the contents of line 71, when restored, may shed some light on the matter. 81 Lines 76-79. These lines contain Enkimdu's placating speech to Dumuzi; Jacobsen's assumption that it is Ianna who speaks these lines is proved erroneous by the fact that ththy re rritten in the Eme .U dialect; Inanna's words, as can be seen from lines 20-26 of our text, would be reproduced in the Emesal. Note the rendering of the verbs in lines 76-79 as precatives even though they are preteritr in form; cf. SS 1:27, note 56. For the rendering of Lines 74-5, cf. SLTI? 16 rev. 10: 6-me-e -diuitu-u en-te- en-*e5--uu-ta a-na mu-da-ab(!)-sig-e-en tEmel, my son, thy dost thou strive against thy brother Enten" (Enlil is speaking). In line 79, the reading mf! and sila for the first two signs (instead of gif and ir(?) as in the copy) is based on Jacobsen's in- sight, as is obvious from his translation of the line; as for U4 NUN, since it is not followed by the determinative ki, it is by no means certain that it is to be read adab. 82. Lines 80-83. These lines contain Dumuzi's answer to Enkimdu in which he invites the latter to his marriage, presumably with Inanna. As the reader will note, this new rendering not only differs from that of Jacobsen, who treats it as part of an address by Inanna, but is also the exact opposite of the rendering in Si. For here again we find the verbal form introduced by the ambiguous na-, and on form alone may be taken either as positive or negative in meaning. The new rendering which takes it as a positive is based on the context and particularly on the following passage in the</page><page sequence="30">68 Kramer, Review of Frankfort, Intellectual Adventure 81. 0 farmer, mayest thou be counted as my friend, 82. 0 farmer Enkimdu, as my friend, 0 farmer, as my friend, 83.

Among the numerous variants are to be noted ne-e for the ne-en of the first line, and -tu-ri-en for -tu--r-am in line 3. As the last three lines of our passage seem to show beyond reasonable doubt, IM-DUGUD is offering a reward for a favor rendered him, and nam-ba-e-ni-in-tu-ra-dm of the third line must therefore be rendered as a positive (note that if this proves correct, we have in this brief passage one nain introducing a positive verbal form,and another, that of line 5, introducing a negative). Finally it is to be noted that nam-ba-e-ni-tu -ra-Am (the -e- in all probability is due to a pleonastic orthography and is not morphologically significant) might have been expected to end in tu-ri-en-&amp;m; (that is, the verb is a permansive); this is true also of the verb in lines 81 and 83 of our myth (the omission of -4t in line 81 may be a miscopy). 83 Lines 84-87. These lines contain Enkimdu's joyful answer to Dumuzi and, to judge from lines 86-7, to Inanna, who may perhaps be understood to have been present throughout the Dumuzi-Enkimdu dialogue; as a result of the friendly invitation to the wedding, Enkimdu offers to bring them some of the products of his farming.

Lines 88-9 contain a comment by the scribe which is typical of this literary genre, cf.SLTN 16 rev. 18 ff. and SEJ 17 rev. 10 ff.; it is rather un- fortunate, however, that the line corresponding to SLIN 16 rev. 19 and SEJ 17 rev. 11 is omitted in our case, since that line would have stated who was the victor in the dispute. The last line, bal-bai-e-dam, seems to be a variant for the more common bal-</page><page sequence="31">Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 2 (1948) 69 The contents of the myth may therefore now be summarized as follows: Following a brief introduction whose contents are largely fragmentary (1-9), we find Utu addressing his sister and urging her to become the wife of the shepherd Dumuzi (1C-19). Inanna's answer (2C-34?) consists of a flat refusal; she is determined instead to marry the farmer Enkimdu.85 Following several fragmentary lines of uncertain meaning (35-39), the text continues with a long address of the shepherd directed to Inanna, in which he details his superiority over the farmer (4C-64). We then find the shepherd rejoicing on ha the river bank, probably because his argument convinced Inanna and induced her to change her mind. 86 There he meets Enk u and starts a fight with him (65-73). But Enkimdu refuses to fight and agrees to allow Dumuzi's flocks to pasture anywhere in his territory (74-79). The latter, thus appeased, invites the farmer to his wedding as one of his friends (80-83). Whereupon Enkimdu offers to bring him and Inanna several selected farm- products as a wedding gift (84-E7). The scribe then closes the poem with the conventional literary notations. So mucH for the first, longest, and most important chapter on the character of speculative thought in ancient Meospotamia, that is, the chapter devoted to the cosmos as a state. In the chapter that follows, entitled "The Function of the State," the reader will find a detailed, lucid, and beautifully analyzed description of the organiza- tion of the temple Eninnu in the city-state of Lagash; it is based on a very careful and obviously original study of the texts of the Gudea Cylinders. 87 The chapter then con- tinues witth an inreresting c4iscussion of the role of Aingship ir 84 bal-e dx(name of deity)-kam, cf. e.g. SRT 9 obv. 21; .ibid. 23 rev. 28; SLTN 62 rev. 12. 85 Note that there is no introductory statement to indicate who addresses whom in any of the speeches in the poem except the first, Utu's address to Inanna; in all the other cases it is only from the context that we can gather who the speaker is. Helpful in this connection is the dialect in which the speech is reproduced; if the Emesal is used, it is of course Inanna who is speaking. 86 It must be stressed, however, that this is only an inference from the context; it is not expressly stated anywhere in the text. 87 To judge from the statement on p. 189 that "Gudea first noted that something was amiss when the river Tigris, which Ningursu controlled, failed to rise as usual and flood the fields," Jacobsen treats the verbal forms nomi-g i and nam-DU of Gudea Cyl. 1 5, 6, 7, and 9, as negatives. This, unless I am very mislaken, is an error; these verbal forms are in all probability to be taken as positives. That is, the passage refers to a time when Lagash was enjoying a period of prosperity, when Enlil had looked with favorable eye upon Ningirsu, and when, therefore, the Tigris had over- flowed its banks, assuring bounteous crops to the city and its environs.

The third and last chapter on Mesopotamia, entitled "The Good Life," begins with an analysis of the role of obedience as a prime virtue in Mesopotamian life; it is based largely on new and excellent translations of a number of brief Sumerian "wisdom" passages.89 The chapter then takes up several Mesopotamian views with regard to the problem of justice in the universe, dwelling particularly on Gilgamesh's revolt against death, on the complaint of the "righteous sufferer," and on the cynical "master-servant" dialogue which seems to deny all moral values in life. In conclusion, one cannot praise too highly Mrs. .Prankfort's poetical renditions of the cited Sumerian and Akkadian passages. Largely by means of expert, precise, and unusually apt selection of her words, she has succeeded in transforming the more literal and stilted translations of the scholar into flexible and effective poetic idiom; at the same time her renderings have lost none of the original meaning and none of its rhythmic flavor. All in all it is a masterful achievement, and sets an example which future translators, including the present writer, will do well to follow. 88 On p. 192 the statement that Enlil was "commander of the armed forces" is hardly justified by the available evidence, for nowhere in the extant texts is it stated that Enlil led the gods in battle. Whenever Enlil has difficulties with foreign lands, for example, he sends "heroic" deities such as Ninurta, Nergal, and Ninisinna to do battle with his enemies, but there is no indication that Enlil himself ever deigns to do the actual fighting. 89 The Sumerian passage translated on p. 202, be it noted, is not prt of a "hymn' but belongs to a composition known as the "Lamentation Over the Destruction of Nippur (cf. now SLTN 33); it is part of the latter half of the composition, which eulogizes the delivery of Nippur and its restoration by Itme-Dagan of Isin. To be noted, too, is the fact that it is not quite certain whether the Akkadian letter translated on pp. 205-6 is actually one addressed to a deity. S. N.
