<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW Andrea Poma, The Critical Philosophy of Hermann Cohen. Translated by John Denton (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1997). xiv + 320 pp. English readers will be and should be deeply grateful for the SUNY Press's publication of a translation from the Italian of The Critical Philos- ophy of Hermann Cohen by Andrea Poma. Poma's book is by far the most comprehensive account of Cohen's thought available in the English lan- guage. Indeed, though this book does not make for easy reading (then again neither does Cohen), what Poma is able to squeeze into about 300 pages is astonishingly impressive. He presents a clear and comprehen- sive account of Cohen's entire philosophical system and also raises the fundamental historical and philosophical issues regarding the status of Cohen's philosophical and Jewish thought. What is of particular interest for readers of modern Jewish thought is that Poma shows convincingly that Cohen's approach to critical idealism and Jewish monotheism are intimately connected, not for sentimental reasons, as a number of inter- preters have maintained over the years, but philosophically.' Bridging the issues that concern German, Israeli, and American scholarship on Co- hen, this book sets the agenda for future work on Cohen's thought, both in its general andJewish philosophical contexts. The title of the book-The Critical Philosophy of Hermann Cohen- sums up its complex and subtle argument. Poma contends that Cohen's philosophy is a critical idealism. By this he means that "idealism and crit- ical philosophy are not simply two juxtaposed, extrinsic features, but two closely connected aspects, the result being that its critical charac- ter is the determining factor in Cohen's idealism, which differentiates it from, and contrasts it with any other kind of idealism" (p. 55). The critical character of Cohen's idealism is meant to counter spiritualism, metaphysical materialism, eudaemonism and, perhaps most important within the context of Jewish thought, all forms of pantheism, which for Cohen include the philosophy of identity, monism, and most funda- mentally, mysticism of any kind. More specifically, the critical character of idealism represents the confluence between philosophy and science for Cohen: "For Cohen there is no true idealism that is not critical, nor true critical philosophy that is not idealist, so what is the difference be- tween skepticism and critical philosophy? It is adherence to science that distinguishes them.., .idealism is connected to this adherence, since a critical philosophy of science is necessarily a grounding of the phenom- enon in idea as hypothesis" (pp. 60-61). As Poma's book implicitly, Modern Judaism 19 (1999): 207-211 ? 1999 by TheJohns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">208 Modern Judaism though not explicitly, demonstrates, this confluence between idealism and science for Cohen is also a confluence between Jewish monotheism and critical philosophy. I return to this issue below. In the first seven chapters, Poma focuses on the development of Cohen's thought and system of philosophy in the contexts of Cohen's readings of Kant, Plato, and the German idealist tradition. Poma offers a detailed analysis of Cohen's claim to have recovered the classical ideal- ism of Plato, Leibniz, and Kant, and the ways in which Cohen trans- formed Kant's philosophy in his attempt to apply more rigorously what he took to be Kant's transcendental method. Poma's account of Cohen's notion of critical ethics is particularly relevant: Cohen did not claim to have solved the ethical problem in this way, but simply to have founded the universal concept of man, purely, in the concept ofjuridical person, on the basis of which the ethical approach to contents can be developed, that is, on moral persons and the rela- tionships between them. The universal concept of juridical person is thus, in Cohen's view, still abstract, but, owing to its pure character, al- lows the construction of critical ethics, not grounded in an empirical, naturalistic concept of man (p. 122). Contemporary readers of the American philosopher John Rawls will recognize Rawls's attempt at a critical theory of justice in Poma's de- scription of what Cohen was after philosophically.2 Though the histori- cal and philosophical affinities are clear, they are too often ignored. Poma's thorough and thoughtful philosophical analysis should help in the recovery of this aspect of Cohen's philosophy. Cohen's conceptual affinity with contemporary moral philosophy relates not just to issues of method, but to issues of content also. Cohen regarded Kant's distinction between logic and ethics, between being and what ought to be, as the lasting hallmark of Kant's philosophy. This led Cohen to reassess completely Kant's conception of law and to make the science of law the focus of his own ethics. Already here we see the inter- section between Cohen's notions of critical philosophy and Judaism, for Cohen argued that Kant's Christian, and particularly Pauline, preju- dices led him to misjudge seriously the nature of law by contrasting it to freedom. In the first seven chapters, Poma lays the groundwork for his argu- ment in the final four chapters that Cohen's philosophy of religion, specifically his arguments aboutJewish monotheism, do not constitute a break with his system but a continuation and working through of issues already present in it. Against Franz Rosenzweig's view in particular, Poma maintains that "Cohen further investigated problems that were al- ready present in his system, and..,. his results were not a turning point, but a coherent further investigation of critical philosophy" (p. 155). I</page><page sequence="3">Review 209 will highlight just two important points that Poma makes in analyzing Cohen's system in the first seven chapters, points that allow him to de- fend this thesis in the final third of the book. The first is Poma's lucid explanation of Cohen's logical conception of "conservation" and the fundamental way in which this concept lays the groundwork for Cohen's arguments about messianic history. Poma explains: In the ordinary sense, unity, as the conservation of unity and manifold- ness, is simply a contradiction. This is because the product of thought is seen as present and completed, and its productive activity as past. If, however, one takes up the principle that production itself is the prod- uct, and that activity itself is content, then the perspective shifts in the direction of the future (emphasis added, p. 87).3 In this context, Poma demonstrates how Cohen's conception of the mes- sianic future is both critical and ideal: the messianic future is posited critically as ideal in respect of the pre- sent historical-political situation, as "being of the future'" truer, and thus more real, than the being of the present, since sensibility is the 'instrument for knowing the actual present,' but an idea is the instru- ment for future reality (p. 238). Second, Poma shows convincingly that for Cohen the idea of God bridges logic and ethics. This important point sets the stage for Poma's argument for the continuity of Cohen's philosophical concerns and methods. Poma rightly points out that with his philosophy of religion, and ofJewish monotheism in particular, Cohen deals with "the problem of the limit,' a problem that logic and ethics could only glimpse (p. 168). Cohen's religious messianic idealism, therefore, according to Poma, is "an expansion beyond systematic scientific knowledge.., .which, with- out rejecting rationality, pushes it to its limits." Poma does not wish to deny the importance of Cohen's view of the peculiarity of religion that he develops in his posthumous Religion of Reason Out of the Sources ofJudaism. He believes, however, that proper philosophical attention to Cohen's system as a whole shows that al- though Cohen deals in his Religion with the phenomena of religion, his position remains a rejection of any phenomenological account. Though Cohen responded both in the Religion (and even earlier in the preface to the second edition of his Ethik des reinen Willens) to Wilhelm Her- mann's criticism that his system did not understand the concrete indi- vidual, Poma rightly points out that Cohen does not accept Hermann's philosophical parameters. Rather, Cohen uses Hermann's criticisms as an opportunity to further his own critical idealist agenda. Poma thus concludes that</page><page sequence="4">210 Modern Judaism Rosenzweig's opinion that Cohen's religious philosophy in this last stage was an abandonment of idealism and a conversion to the existen- tial philosophy of relation is grounded on radical emphasis and identi- fication in Cohen's arguments of the theme of the individual and on understanding of Cohen's concept of correlation in connection with the latter theme. The opposite seems to me to be more correct and faithful to Cohen: the situating of the theme of the individual in the context of the critical concept of correlation and its new developments in Co- hen's late religious philosophy (pp. 197-98). The remainder of Poma's book is an exploration of some key themes in Cohen's philosophy of religion, including very helpful discussions of Cohen's notion of the Holy Spirit and the problem of suffering. If there can be said to be any weakness in Poma's superb study, it is that he takes for granted the confluence between Jewish monotheism and scientific idealism that Cohen posits and does not explore its impli- cations in the context ofJewish thought. This is not really a criticism, as this book already does more than any single study could be expected to do. Nonetheless, in my opinion, this is the most important question that those who are interested in Jewish thought must ask of Cohen. Poma demonstrates convincingly that Rosenzweig misrepresented Cohen's late philosophy. However, although Poma shows in great detail that the late writings of Cohen do not break with his critical idealism, both in intention, and more important, in method, it remains an open question whether Cohen's conception of Jewish monotheism is in any way adequate. Poma rightly points out that on philosophical grounds, both critical idealism and existentialism can only describe God in an in- adequate manner. But how does the critical-idealist view of God stack up from the perspective of the Jewish tradition? Poma merely asserts that Cohen's is the more consistent Jewish position: At least Cohen's reflections on God, more than those of others... stays far away from any kind of anthropomorphism, being rigorously faithful to the biblical commandment forbidding images, and the theo- logical tradition of God's attributes (p. 233). Although Cohen adheres to the theological tradition of God's attributes (and Maimonides's tradition in particular), it remains a debatable issue whether Cohen is rigorously faithful to the biblical commandment for- bidding images, or whether he himself constructs such a rational com- mandment in the context of his critical idealism. Rosenzweig's philosophical legacy in relation to Cohen may not be his (perhaps consciously) misguided interpretation of Cohen's philo- sophical system, but his criticism of the Cohenian, and the Jewish ratio- nalist tradition's, view of biblical "anthropomorphism." Rosenzweig held</page><page sequence="5">Review 211 that the tendency to rationalize away biblical anthropomorphisms (as epitomized by Cohen and Maimonides) is both dishonest and a mis- understanding of the Bible.4 Indeed, the very term anthropomorphism is laden with rationalist prejudice. Properly speaking, Rosenzweig main- tains, there is no "anthropomorphism" in the Bible. Rather, "the 'anthro- pomorphisms' of the Bible are throughout assertions about meetings between God and man.'5 Once we understand that the Bible's descrip- tions of God are about meetings that take place in time rather than about essences that are eternal, we can understand that the Bible does not "assert something either about God or about man, but only about an event between the two."' Rosenzweig argues that the philosophical problems created by "biblical anthropomorphisms" are a result of a cate- gory error. The Bible is not concerned with what God is, but rather with how God acts, in time, in God's relation to the human being.' The issue of the status of anthropomorphism goes to the very heart of much of the history ofJewish thought, for it raises precisely the ques- tion of the relation between Judaism and the Western philosophical tra- dition. By making so clear Cohen's critical philosophical agenda, Poma's book gives the English-speaking world an unprecedented opportunity to reflect upon the question of modern Judaism's relation to modern philosophy. LEORA BATNITZKY Princeton University NOTES 1. There is of course a long history to this debate. Franz Rosenzweig argued that Cohen's late philosophy constituted an existential break with his idealist sys- tem (See Einleitung, in Hermann Cohen, Jiidische Schriften, ed. Franz Rosenzweig (Berlin, 1924), Vol. 1. Among those who have aligned themselves with Rosen- zweig's position are Shmuel Hugo Bergman and Natan Rotenstreich. Among those who have argued that there is no such break are Steven Schwarzschild and Alexander Altmann. 2. See Rawls's A Theory of Justice (Cambridge, Mass., 1985). 3.
