L'Orientalisme en France.-Le Dieu supreme des Aryens.-Les Cosmogonies Aryennes.-Prolegomenes de l'His- toire des Religions.-Mdlanges de Mythologie et de Linguis- tique.-La Legende d'Alexandre, &amp;c. Par James Darmesteter. 8vo. pp. 280. Paris: A. Levy; London: D. Nutt. 1883. Two essays in this volume are especially worthy the attention of the comparative mythologist, those on the Supreme Deity of the Aryans and on the Aryan Cosmogonies. In the latter the author develops with great skill the idea that creation myths are in their origin storm myths. To primitive man the rebirth of the visible world after the stress and confusion of the storm suggested the thought that the first creation had been an act of the same nature. The chaos out of which the universe emerged was conceived by him as similar to the dark and tumultuous cloud-mass out of which the lightning strikes the fertilising rain, which the wind carries away out of sight, or which the sun, rising in the heavens, gradually dissipates. Every form of the conquest and dispersal of the threatening cloud- masses was the mythic germ of a fresh cosmogonical idea. As the early naturalism became obscured a metaphysical value was given to the existing cosmogonical formulas, and in this way the mystic cos- mogonies assumed shape. Thus the strife of the lightning with the storm cloud was early figured as the deliverance of a captive light- maiden from the clutches of the darkness-dragon by an enamoured god or hero; and in the oldest texts which ascribe the creation act to Love it is still the lover-god, the personified lightning, who is thought of, and who, as Schomann has remarked, is described in terms which to us seem more fitting in connection with Typhon than with Eros. But a later age made of this lover-god, a God Love, an embodiment of the sexual principle in its widest sense, and thus originated a series of very remarkable conceptions. In the former essay M. Darmesteter 94</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES AND NEWS. tries to show that the conception of a supreme god was common to the Aryan race before their dispersion; that he was originally the person- ified sky, and that the anthropomorphic process had made such progress when the dispersion did take place that the subsequent development among the different branches was and could only be very similar. He shows, however, that whilst the Iranian, the Greek, the Latin, and the Slave, retained to the last the sky god as the head of their pantheon, the Indian and the Lithuanian substituted the lightning-god, the German the stormwind-god. Such is a brief summary of the result arrived at in these learned and brilliantly written articles. We have left ourselves no space to speak of the remaining contents of this fascinating volume, in which fulness of knowledge and sureness of method are united to literary skill and sympathetic insight. The Almanach des traditions populaires for 1883, which has recently been issued by Messrs. Maisonneuve and Co., of Paris, is even superior in interest and value to the 1882 volume. Besides a fresh instalment of addresses of Continental and English folk-lorists there is a full and carefully compiled bibliography of the publications of the past year. The " Chronique " gives an interesting account of the dinners of "Ma Me're l'Oye," which were started last year to enable the folk-lorists of Paris to meet each other in a friendly and informal way. Four of them were held last year with MM. Gaston Paris and Loys Bruyere (the accomplished editor of the Contes Populaires de la Grande Bretagne) in the chair. The dates for the forthcoming season are, the 13th of March, 10th of April, 8th of May, 13th of November, and 11th of December. English mem- bers of the Society who may happen to be in Paris on any of these dates, and apply to M. L. Bruyere, 134, Boulevard Haussmann, for tickets will be made heartily welcome. London folk-lorists might well follow the good example set them by their Paris brethren, and start a course of Mother Goose dinners. Will any members who think the idea a good one write to the Secretary? The apostolic spirit is evidently not wanting in M. Oscar Havard, who, in the Monde Hebdomadaire for the 9th, 16th, and 23rd Septem- 95</page><page sequence="3">NOTICES AND NEWS. ber last, relates how, fired by the chance perusal of one of M. Paul Sebillot's volumes, he set forth tale-hunting in Lower Normandy. He gives an amusing account of the many rebuffs he met with, but tact and perseverance were finally rewarded by no less than 200 tales, songs, and local traditions. As a specimen of his gleanings he prints in the No. for the 30th of September a tale, Le Loup et la Poulotte, to which English nursery literature can show a very close parallel in the legend of the " Fox and the Geese." M. Havard discusses at some length the vexed question of the origin of Marchen, and what he has to say on the subject is sensible and to the point. In the No. for the 30th of December, 13th and 20th of January, he gives an interesting description of French carol-singing, printing, some for the first time, the words and music of many " Noels." Valaable informa- tion is afforded too concerning recent and forthcoming works on the subject. As several of these are either privately printed or are pub- lished in small provincial towns, they would, but for M. Havard, have remained unknown to the generality of book-buyers. We hope that M. Havard will continue his folk-lore researches and that he will shortly give the world at large the result of his studies. Mr. Otto Harrassowitz, of Leipzig, has recently issued a catalogue of the extensive and valuable library of the late Theodor Benfey, the great Sanscrit scholar and editor of the Pantchantantra. As might be expected, it is exceedingly rich in works on comparative philology, mythology, and folk-lore. Copies may be had from Mr. D. Nutt, 270, Strand. Mrs. E. B. Mawer, of Bucharest, is preparing a collection of proverbs. Translations are not given, but only equivalents where they exist. As an example of the work, the following may perhaps be quoted :- English. More haste worse speed. Roumanian. Cine umbla incetu adjunge departe. French. Pas a pas on va bien loin. German. Eile mit weile. Italian. Chi va piano va sano, e chi va sano va lontano. Spanish. Poco a poco se va lejos. Portuguese. Molle molle se vai longe. Dutch. Haastigen spoed is gelden goed. Danish. Est haar efter andet, gjir Bonden skaldet. Latin. Festina lente. 96</page></plain_text>
