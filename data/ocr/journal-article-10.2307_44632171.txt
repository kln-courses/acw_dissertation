Warner Collision Safety Engrg., Inc. ABSTRACT Impact tests were conducted on thirty-one unembalmed human cadaver heads. Impacts were delivered to the temporo-parietal region of fixed cadavers by two, different sized, flat-rigid impactors. Yield fracture force and stiffness data for this region of the head are presented. Impactor surfaces consisted of a 5 cm2 circular plate and a 52 cm2 rectangular plate. The average stiffness value observed using the circular impactor was 1800 N/mm, with an average bone-fracture-force level of 5000 N. Skull stiffness for the rectangular impactor was 4200 N/mm, and the average fracture-force level was 12,500 N. INTRODUCTION Efforts to quantify the impact response of the temporo-parietal region of the human skull were undertaken over a century ago.Cl1 Following that initial effort, little was recorded in the literature until the late sixties and early seventies when efforts by Melvin, Schneider, Nahum, Hodgson, and their colleagues, were published. C2"5] These studies concentrated on fracture- force levels, and did not address the dynamic deflection or stiffness of the skull during impact. It is felt that documenting the human skull stiffness is a critical step in evaluating the biofidelity of current anthropomorphic test dummies, and is also necessary for future research and design work on dummy heads capable of measuring meaningful lateral impact loads. Due to Newton's second law (F=ma), and the inversely proportional relationship between deflection and acceleration during impact, unless the test device and the biological material have a similar stiffness, forces observed by the test device are not meaningful, because they cannot be directly compared to biomechanics data. Therefore, objectives of research presented here were to: 1 ) Document the stiffness of the temporo-parietal region of the human skull during impact; and 2) Augment fracture-force data which has previously been gathered. PROCEDURE/INSTRUMENTATION THEORY - Many different approaches have been employed during the past few decades to determine the force at which skull bones fracture. Some approaches involved multiple impacts to a single specimen, with increased force until a fracture was detected. Other approaches bracketed the fracture force by impacting several specimens only once, but at various force levels, noting which levels produced fracture. This research used a new technique developed by Allsop et al.[6] It involves impacting each specimen with more than enough energy to cause fracture, recording the force-time history during impact, and identifying fracture force by the discontinuity observed on the force-time history. An example is shown in Figure 1 where fracture is observed at approximately 36 msec and the force is 16 kN. In contrast, note Figure 2 where a Hybrid III dummy head was impacted without causing fracture. The smooth nearly symmetric curve indicates no abrupt changes in material resistance, and therefore no fracture. In this research, fracture force values determined from force-time traces were corroborated by acoustic emissions-time histories, as was previously done by Allsop. [1b1d] A typical acoustic emissions (AE) trace is shown in Figure 3. Prior to fracture little or no acoustic energy is recorded, but even when a hairline fracture occurs, acoustic emissions are observed. The trace in the figure suggests fracture at 5.8 msec after the AE - time history began. In Figure 4, force-time and AE - time histories for a single impact have been plotted on the same time scale. The discontinuity in the force-time history, and the onset of AE energy, cleariy identify the force level at which fracture occurred. Stiffness data were generated by measuring the impactor displacement during impact, and cross-plotting these data with force-time data. This eliminated the time axis, and left the desired stiffness characteristics in the form of a force-deflection curve, as shown in Figure 5. 2009</page><page sequence="2">FORCE vs TIME M25794.1-8 5000. i i i 1000 0 i 1 0. ^ / "H Z / / : O w -5000. i / = -1000. 70 ^ ^ m O- 10000. i / 1 ~2000* ^ m ^ : / W -h / Ī -3000.

It consists of a drop tower, shown in Figure 6, which was unchanged with the exception of the actual impacting surface or impactor, and slightly modified AE recording equipment. For this series of tests two impactors were used. One was a flat rectangular plate approximately 5 cm by 10 cm which weighed 12 kg (Figure 7). This plate was actually a composite of eight smaller impactor inserts, each with dimensions of 5 by 1.1 cm and an edge radius of 5.1 mm as shown in Figure 8. The eight inserts connected to piezo-electric force transducers, so that a force-time curve was generated for each centimeter of length along the impactor surface. Therefore, eight force-time curves were generated for each rectangular plate impact, and were later summed to generate the total force-time curve. The second impactor is seen in Figures 9 and 10. It is a flat circular plate with a contact surface diameter of 2.54 cm and an edge radius of 2 mm. This impactor weighs 10.6 kg and was connected to a Kistler 9251 -A force transducer, which recorded data only in the vertical or "Z" direction. Displacement or deflection was recorded by two string potentiometers attached to the impacting mass. The first was a Gynisco 100g string pot, and the second was a custom built continuous loop pot. The continuous loop pot was a precautionary measure employed to eliminate the possibility of potentiometer overshoot during the high decelerations encountered during impact. All of the force and displacement instrumentation was digitally sampled by a TransEra MDAS 7000 data acquisition system at a rate of 5000 Hz. As previously mentioned, AE - time histories were recorded during impact. This was accomplished by attaching conical-shaped wave guides to 6.4 mm diameter AE sensors (MAC-300L), making a small incision in the skin near the impact site, and wedging the wave guides into the flesh. The acoustic energy waves or acoustic emissions were transferred from the sensors to a digital oscilloscope board (SCC-1220) during impact, and recorded for later analysis. AE sampling rates were 1 .0 MHz and 2.0 MHz for the rectangular and circular impactors respectively. SPECIMEN PREPARATION - Specimens, which had been frozen, were allowed to thaw for at least 24 hours, but not more than 32 hours prior to impact. All specimens were rinsed, shaven, measured, and placed in plaster of paris with a rolled towel between their teeth to reduce erroneous acoustic emissions. The depth of plaster of paris was approximately 40-50% of the head width. For rectangular plate impacts, heads were rotated 45 degrees from the horizontal plane as shown in Figure 1 1 . For circular plate impacts, specimens were oriented with the sagittal plane at a right angle to the impactor plane of travel. (See Figure 12) 2012</page><page sequence="5">Figure 6 Front View of Drop Tower TEST PROCEDURE - In the A-P direction, specimens were aligned, so that the impactor centerline would fall just slightly anterior to the external auditory meatus. The rectangular plate impact location is shown in Figure 13. The two impact locations employed with the circular impactor are illustrated in Figure 14. The drop height for most of the rectangular plate impacts was 102 cm, with a nominal impact velocity of 4.3 m/s. Most of the circular plate impacts were conducted at a drop height of 38 cm, with a nominal impact velocity of 2.7 m/s. RESULTS FRACTURE FORCE - Analysis of the force-time and AE - time curves, following the procedure previously Figure 7 Rectangular Plate Impactor Head and Body Figure 8 Rectangular Plate Impactor Head outlined, generated the fracture force levels listed in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 lists results for the rectangular impactor, while Table 2 lists data for the circular impactor. The rectangular plate caused fracture at an average force level of 12,390 N with a standard deviation of 3654 N. The circular plate fracture forces averaged to 4990 N for location one and 5400 N for location two. Standard deviations were 1801 N and 1984 N for locations one and two respectively. 2013</page><page sequence="6">Figure 9 Circular Plate Impactor Head and Body Figure 10 Circular Plate Impactor Head and Body It is interesting to note that if the exceptionally high fracture level from Specimen M26373 is left out of the data set, the average fracture value for impact sites one and two, are nearly identical at 4889 N and 4990 N. STIFFNESS - The stiffness values for the rectangular and circular impactors (listed in Tables 3 and 4 respectively) were taken directly from the force- displacement curves generated from each impact. Force- displacement curves for each of the impacts are plotted in Figures 15 and 16. To compute the stiffness value, the average slope of the force-displacement curve was evaluated between the force range of 4 to 12 kN for the rectangular impactor and 2 to 6 kN for the circular impactor. I i Figure 11 Specimen Orientation for Rectangular Plate Impacts (Diagonal Lines Indicate Plaster of Paris) Figure 12 Specimen Orientation for Circular Plate Impacts (Diagonal Lines Indicate Plaster of Paris) DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FRACTURE FORCE - A ratio of two and one-half to one was observed between the average fracture-force level of the rectangular and circular impactors. The impact angle and impact location for these impactors were slightly different, however, the difference in impactor area is likely the most significant factor in this variation. A four- to-one ratio between the high and low value in each set of 2014</page><page sequence="7">Figure 13 Impact Location for the Retangular Impactor Figure 14 Impact Locations for the Circular Impactor data also exists. This variability is not uncommon in biomechanical testing. The fracture-force range observed in previous research on the temporo-parietal region is bounded at 700 N on the low end, and 14,950 N on the high end. The averages for the previous studies range from 3120 N to 8500 N.[1"5] It appears that the variation observed in this study is similar to that observed by others. As expected, the higher forces were recorded by the larger area impactor, indicating a significant relationship between contact area and fracture force.

Particular Interest has centered on calcium and magnesium. A sample coupon was extracted and measured for mineral content from each specimen. To determine the correlation between fracture force and mineral content, a correlation coefficient was computed for each test group and for various combined groups (see Tables 5 and 6). In each case, the correlation coefficients indicated no significant relationship between the mineral content and fracture force of subjects tested. This does not establish a lack of correlation between bone fracture strength and bone mineral content, but indicates that other effects (geometric, etc.) have a greater influence over the fracture strength for lateral impacts to the head of the type discussed in this paper.

The stiffness for the same region averaged 4200 N/mm. 2) Fracture force for a 2.54 cm diameter flat-circular plate impacting the temporo-parietal region of the human cadaver head averaged 5 kN. The stiffness for the same region averaged 1800 N/mm. 3) Fracture force and stiffness of the human cadaver head are significantly affected by impactor contact area, however, they do not seem to be significantly related to calcium nor magnesium content. 2016</page><page sequence="9">5x10 cm RECTANGULAR PLATE IMPACTS °.
