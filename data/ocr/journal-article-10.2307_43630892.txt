Harman's particular strand within this, object- oriented ontology, posits that objects, including people, relate blindly with respect to being, and hence are withdrawn from or unknowable to each other. See Graham Harman, The Quadruple Object (United Kingdom: Zero Books, 2011). 2. Michael Fried, Art and Objecthood (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1998), 156. One might object that, given enough distance, say the infinite distance of axonometric projection, architecture appears as object. In this case, however, even with a sufficiently large and empty ground, the viewer cannot possibly circle the object to enact the performance implicit in the notion of objecthood. 4. On the subject of part-to-whole rela- tionships, Fried remarks that objecthood is confined to singular wholes. Multiple parts produce relationships within the work, as opposed to between object and audience. See Fried, Art and Objecthood , 150. Whether under the sway of speculative realism, respond- ing to the legacy of minimalism, or reacting to a recent his- tory of iconic buildings, contemporary architecture practice has returned to the topic of objecthood. In the conflation of Graham Harman's current defense of the object with a sec- ond appropriation of Michael Fried's 1967 essay, "Art and Objecthood," the object-building has become the object- not-object-building. From Anne Truitt-like paint jobs gone awry to perceptually nonconstant objects, these new build- ings act to confound their own appearance. Simultaneously emulating and dissembling objects, they borrow Fried's qualifications of objecthood to manifest Harman's philoso- phy of withdrawn objects.1 Though consequential, this work misses two important points: that architecture is not an ob- ject in the art historical sense and necessarily already stands apart from objecthood, and that while almost everything is an object according to Harman, objects are already inacces- sible in his view. Setting aside recent theorizing of the object, the ob- jecthood Fried attributes to "literalist" or minimalist art is dependent on scale, and specifically on an approximately hu- man, anthropomorphic scale. He writes, "The entities or be- ings encountered in everyday experience in terms that most closely approach the literalist ideals of the nonrelational, the unitary, and the holistic are other persons"1 This quality, the equivalence between object and person, permits the object to be understood as such, and not, for example, as a monument, while also evoking the experience of encounter or confron- tation.5 A preoccupation with staging experiences of this sort might explain the profusion of installations, pavilions, and follies in recent times, but it also loses sight of architecture's performance as it grows toward building. While much of architecture at the scale of building is calibrated, or deliber- ately miscalibrated, to the size of the body, it is so in part and not in whole.4 This is not to argue that architecture should decouple itself from art and find its own direction, but that it might 75</page><page sequence="2">Etienne Duperac, Campidoglio , 1568. participate without mirroring. Objecthood, in addition to delineating a certain class of things, conditions the space oc- cupied by those things. In deferring to the object, this space is evacuated and without architectural specificity, allowing the isolated object to be seen from multiple, possibly infi- nite, vantage points while maintaining its primacy as the thing under view. What Fried refers to as a "room,"5 such a space is not minimalist for its reductive quality and lack of adornment, but for the encounter it shapes. Architecture, then, in its space-defining capacity, can frame the view of an object so that it can resist comprehension and appear in many ways. Thus the object may be destabilized not only by its constitution, but also in its viewing. This idea returns us to a much more distant past than that of Fried - to the ex- periments in perspective originating in the quattrocentro. Beyond the central perspective privileged in most accounts of the Renaissance, a lineage of idiosyncratic perspectives, distinct in their removal or multiplication of vantage and vanishing points, reveals how architecture can construct views to destabilize itself, objects, or anything else passing through its frame. * * * Long cast as either protagonist or adversary in wide-ranging and seemingly exhaustive debates on the nature of repre- sentation, perspective is capable of being almost anything to anyone. It is, variously, the manifestation of hierarchical power and the expression of human individuality, a mimesis of nature and a total abstraction arrived at through geome- try, or a representation of the world as it is seen and a learned way of seeing. Beyond these interpretations, tailor-made to 5.

That is, perspective is not merely a depictive, representa- tional, or aesthetic device, but is also a set of spatial proposi- tions enabled by marks on a surface. Central perspective, as demonstrated by Brunelleschi around 1420 and introduced as construzione legittima by Alberti in his treatise Della pittura , in 14?5, serves as the exemplar of what is, in fact, a range of constructions. In central perspec- tive, all lines perpendicular to the image plane converge at a single point situated midway across the horizontal dimension of the image. The ideal location from which to experience the resulting illusion of three-dimensionality is directly in front of the vanishing point and at a distance specified within the geometry - the vantage point. Viewer and viewed are thus fixed at the endpoints of an axis dividing the image into two halves. This feature of central perspective carries through from paper or canvas to the physical buildings made according to the representation. As Robin Evans has said, "Architecture led to the vanishing point which led to architecture."6 That is, so as to be drawn into the space of perspective, building bears its traces as symmetry, frontality, and axial entry. Without appearing as the literal translation of a per- spective drawing - an example of which would be Zaha Hadid's Vitra Fire Station - architecture can nonetheless reproduce the drawing's reality. Not only does building as- sume the geometric constraints of the drawing so as to make the leap from three dimensions to two and back, the space within and around the building also adjusts so as to pro- duce the view of the two-dimensional representation in the 6.

This is evident in piazzas developed according to the prin- ciples of perspective, such as Bernardo Rossellino's Piazza Pio II (1459-64) and Michelangelo's Piazza del Campidoglio (1536-46). Situated at one end of an open, trapezoidal plaza, the most significant building on the piazza appears as if in perspective by virtue of the arrangement of the space around it. Complementing the building's function as the focal point, the vantage point is established perpendicularly across the piazza at the main entry, defining an axis from entry to end. Thus, piazzas come to calibrate a view so that a build- ing might appear as though it were the same as that depicted, setting up the situation of central perspective. * * * While central perspective would seem to make the world stand still at a precise and fixed location, Erwin Panofsky points out that the space between viewer and viewed is not rigid. In Perspective as Symbolic Formy he describes the differ- ence between a painting with a long perpendicular distance (far vantage point), which sets the object of the painting away from and outside the viewer, and one with a negligible perpendicular distance (near vantage point), which is envel- oping.7 When looking at Raphael's The School of Athens (1510) with this in mind, something peculiar is found. The fresco oc- cupies one wall among four in an eight-by-six-meter room, the Stanza della Segnatura, at the Vatican. When the vantage point is deduced from the ruling geometry of the painting, it is found to be four meters above ground and nine meters back from the fresco, entirely outside the room.8 Although it is im- possible to know if Raphael was concerned with the physical location of his fresco or its vantage point, this indifference is not without effect; it removes the vantage point and prevents the image from being seen directly. The unoccupiable center of The School of Athens finds its analogue in the externalized architectural space of the Piazza Navona, organized by Bernini between 1647 and 1651. The long, lozenge-shaped space occupying what was once the Circus Agonalis is surrounded by densely packed buildings - houses, palaces, and churches - the most prominent of which is the Sant'Agnese church, designed in different stages by Rainaldi, Borromini, and Bernini between 1652 and 1672. Sited at the midpoint of one of the piazza's long edges, the church 78 Log ii</page><page sequence="5">Ferdinando Galli Bibiena, Campidoglio , 1687. Right: Logge Terrene , 1687.

When one views the church from beside the fountain, the facade extends beyond one's field of vision, while from beyond the fountain the view is obscured. Despite its frontal presence, there is no ideal posi- tion for viewing the church. The only possibility of seeing the building in full is from an oblique angle.10 Also indirect, but even more apparent, oblique perspec- tive11 displaces the vanishing point through spatial shear, shifting it to one side of the image. While this type of draw- ing existed prior to the theorization of perspective and per- sisted during the dominance of central perspective, it found its extreme in the drawings and stage sets of Ferdinando Galli Bibiena. In his drawings for Lotto Lotti and Sabadini Bernardo's tragicomedy Didio Giuliano (1687), no stable cen- ter exists, as each of ten scenes terminates in a different lo- cation. As the vanishing point shifts, the vantage point must follow it to preserve the perspectivai illusion, thus locating the ideal viewer on the same side as the off-center vanishing point. One scene in particular from Galli Bibiena's set draw- ings, Campidoglio y terminates entirely off the page (or stage), producing the bizarre situation in which both vanishing point and vantage point are located beyond the edges of the scene. Without the vanishing point placed within the painting, the focal point that would be located by it is obscured. Without an object of focus, the viewer's eye is directed across the grain of the image to the periphery, which then leads back toward the shifted vanishing point. The focal point and the image never align, and looking at either indicates the other without ever completing the picture. 9. See Heinrich Wölfflin, Principles of Art History: The Problem of the Development of Style in Later Art (New York: Dover Publications, 1950), 119. 10. Today, the camera lens's ability to optically change focal length undoes this forced positioning. 11. The term oblique perspective is somewhat vague, referring in some texts to a perspec- tive drawn at an angle and in others to the two-point perspective. Here, it refers to the former. 79 Log ii</page><page sequence="6">Paolo Uccello, Miracle of the Desecrated Host ( Scene 2), 1465 - 69. Logge Terrene, another scene from Galli Bibiena's draw- ings for Didio Giuliano , introduces a third deviation from central perspective. Distinct from the two-point perspec- tive, in which dual vanishing points produce indeterminate or infinite vantage points, the mirrored perspective recur- sively doubles vanishing points and their corresponding van- tage points.12 Two-point perspective was first described by Jean Pèlerin in his book De Artificiali Perspectiva (1505), and depicts rotations in space. The resulting image simultane- ously opens up and closes off views, which seems to call for the use of columns or otherwise porous divisions of space to fully realize its effect. In contrast, the mirrored perspective of Logge Terrene produces an antimonumental organization via the kaleidoscopic repetition of one-point constructions. Drawn as a single central perspective mirrored across its edge, Logge Terrene joins the two adjacent images into one. However, at the vanishing point of each image, the mirror- ing axis of another doubled central perspective takes its place, further dividing the scene. Just as multiple vanishing points exist at varying positions relative to the image plane, multiple vantage points exist at varying positions and distances from it. Consequently, every cue toward focus is thwarted. Where Logge Terrene multiplies the vanishing point, Paolo Uccello's second scene from Miracle of the Desecrated Host (1465-69) multiplies the vantage point. According to the conventions of central perspective, the vantage point lies directly in front of the vanishing point. In an ideal depic- tion of the interior of a room drawn using these conventions, 12. Logge Terrene has often been referred to as a two-point perspective, but its construction differs from the more common use of the term. Here, it is labeled a mirrored perspective to eliminate confusion between the two. 80 Log</page><page sequence="7">the room appears as a truncated pyramid, with a rectangular wall at the rear hiding the vanishing point and four trapezoi- dal walls connecting each edge of the rear wall to the edges of the image plane. One point of view in Miracle is located roughly two-thirds of the way across the painting in front of the implied vanishing point beyond the rear wall, and an- other is found on axis with the true vanishing point where the orthagonal lines converge, farther to the right. The true vanishing point sets up an oblique perspective that, as in Galli Bibiena's Campidoglio , is looked on from an angle. Here, how- ever, one is both in front of the painting and to its side, since the image is split in two. The implied vantage point produces a stereoscopic image in reverse; the center of the truncated pyramid representing the interior room, which by convention denotes the placement of the viewer, is occupied by the end of a depicted wall that lands right between the eyes, separat- ing the image into two distinct, asymmetrical sides. From this position, the scene vacillates irresolvably between two views. * * * Central perspective might seem a questionable case study through which to address contemporary concerns, yet, as the idiosyncratic variations above indicate, the objects held between vantage and vanishing points were never so stable. More than an after-the-fact product of a completed design process, perspective delineates positions from which to see the world and projects architectures capable of constructing those views. Where the minimalism described by Fried elevated objects to personhood, thereby staging the confrontation between the two and requiring a withdrawn architectural space to privilege that interaction, newer work, following Harman's lead, posits that people are objects and thus both are estranged, requiring a different kind of viewing space. Perspective techniques give architecture the means to imag- ine and sustain different conceptions of space and vision, and idiosyncratic views in particular provide a range of relational operations to challenge objecthood. What is called for from architecture, then, is not to illustrate a philosophy that cel- ebrates estrangement and the strangeness of the everyday, but to create alternate ways of seeing and being, of which that celebration is simply one.
