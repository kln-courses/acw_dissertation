<plain_text><page sequence="1">17 Plutarch's Erotikos: The Drag Down Pulled Up FREDERICK E. BRENK, S.J. Plutarch's dialogue on love, or Love, the Erotikos—better known to most readers as the Amatorius—in spite of its obvious Platonic inspiration advocates heterosexual married love as the ideal.1 But focus on this aspect seems to have obscured the real novelty of the essay. At least, this study will try to demonstrate that Plutarch's originality consists not so much in the aspect of reciprocal egalitarian love, as the incorporation of this type of love into the Platonic goal of the vision of the Beautiful, and a new concept of what the Form of the Beautiful is. In the course of the Erotikos Plutarch cites Euripides' Hippolytos (193— 95) as a starting point for an understanding of the true nature of love: SucepcoTEi; Sfj &lt;paiv6(o.e0' ovtei; XO\)8' Oil TOVTO OTV^Pei KOTO yhv, 8i' a7teipoat&gt;vT]v aXkov Pioxov . . .

Plutarch's context is lethe (forgetfulness), which cancels the vision of the Beautiful once seen in another world.3 The words are of Phaidra's nurse in a powerful Greek drama centered on resistance to Eros. In Euripides' play, apparently a classic revision of an earlier Hippolytos, Phaidra dies nobly to 1 Text of R. Flaceliere, in R. Flaceliere and M. Cuvigny, Plutarque. Oeuvres Morales X (Paris 1980).

She commits suicide rather than attempt to seduce Hippolytos. The quotation, then, is not haphazard. Rather it points to the contrast between the drag down, symbolized by Phaidra's sexual drive, and the pull up—in Platonic philosophy the positive evaluation of Eros which leads to the Beautiful in Itself.4 The dramatist who offered to the world Phaidra, also created Medeia, Helena, Kanake, Stheneboia, Laodameia, and many other women whose relationship to life centered around a destructive Eros. There can be no doubt that Euripides enormously influenced subsequent Hellenistic literature. The negative treatment of Eros is exemplified in Hellenistic literature by Apollonios of Rhodes' Argonautika, dealing with the destructive love of Medeia for Iason. Undoubtedly he drew on Euripi des' brilliant exposition of the power of love. But in the Hippolytos the two major characters, though doomed to die, wrench a moral victory from Aphrodite.5 Medeia submits. Apollonios' shadow fell upon the Dido of Vergil's Aeneid. Her passion for Aeneas causes her suicide, and eternal enmity between Carthaginians and Romans. Ovid's generally positive attitude toward amor is also influenced by Euripides and Hellenistic writing. However, his is a poetic development paralleling Plutarch's literary philosophical exposition. Still, the Erotikos is remarkable for its clarity in extolling heterosexual married love, and for its striking frame—the love of Ismenodora for Bacchon. The essay seems, then, at first sight an intellectual milestone. Literature on the Erotikos concentrates on the positive evaluation of eros, heterosexual reciprocity, and the equal status of the partners. Three distinct approaches to the Erotikos can be noted: the anti-Epicurean, the Platonic and the "unitary"—the integration of the sexual and non-sexual aspects of love. The first characterizes to a large extent Robert Flaceliere, whose interest in the Greek concept of eros can be detected in an article on the anti-Epicurean thrust of the Erotikos, his book L'Amour en Grece, and his separate edition of the Erotikos—later incorporated into the Bude Plutarque.6 The outstanding love for his own wife seems reflected in his 4 See the excellent treatments of C.

A. Lesky, Vom Eros der Hellenen (Gottingen 1976) 146-50, suggests strong Stoic influence on Plutarch. C. W. Chilton, "Did Epicurus Approve of Marriage?

Foucault's treatment of the unitary aspect of Plutarch's Erotikos is more theoretical and speculative. Greeks before Plutarch conceived Eros in terms of antitheses: noble-vulgar, eros-philia, active-passive. Altruistic and elevating love or friendship is contrasted with lustful satisfaction. Active or passive defines the relationship to the other partner. However, in the excellent unitary view of Plutarch—according to Foucault—the partners, considered as spouses, are joined as active subjects rather than as objects of love: "Better to love than be loved." Moreover, their sexuality contributes to, rather than distracts from, the higher aspects of love. The principle of reciprocity thus becomes the principle of fidelity: love frustrates the cloying and deforming effects of cohabitation and sexual routine. The opposition between philia and aphrodisia collapses, since, united with grace (charis), both elements contribute to the desired goal. Pederasty, in contrast, which is frustrated in its attempt at perfect integration, is exposed as a horrible failure. Plutarch's stand, then, is both traditional and revolutionary—traditional in its eulogy of Eros, so fundamental to Greek religion and culture, revolutionary in shattering the barrier between "vulgar" love oriented toward sexual pleasure and "spiritual" love meant for the tendance of souls. Plutarch's Eros is monistic, based on reciprocity and charis.13 Before beginning his discourse, Plutarch prayed to the god of love. With a devout prayer let us, too, return to the shrine of Eros, confident that, though the threshold is worn, its mysteries have not been totally divulged. Fundamental to a proper evaluation of the essay is a thorough study of the massive and complex influences of women and sexuality in the early Empire.14 Such a vast subject, even if containable in a few pages, requires 12See F. Lasserre, "'Epornxoi Xoyoi," MH 1 (1944) 169-78, esp. 177. D. Babut, "Les Stoi'ciens et l'amour," REG 76 (1963) 55-63, esp. 62, and C. E. Manning, "Seneca and the Stoics on the Equality of the Sexes," Mnemosyne 26 (1973) 170-77, show that the Stoics by no means believed in equality. Flaceliere, "Caton d'Utique et les femmes," in A. Balland et al., eds.,L'ltalie preromaine et la Rome republicaine (Paris 1976) 293-302, notes how the Stoic Cato "lent out" his wife Marcia to a childless friend (296). Prof. Whittaker, whose Bude Didaskalikos should appear soon, suggests a Middle Platonic comparison with Alkinoos, Didaskalikos XXXII. 7-XXXIII. 4 (187-88); cf. G. Invemizzi, 11 Didaskalikos di Albino e il medioplatonismo II (Rome 1976) 205-07; Apuleius, De Platone et Eius Dogmate II. 13-14 (238—40); J. Beaujeu, Apulee.

The first is the importance of the literary "frame" of Ismenodora's "rape" of Bacchon. The second is a clue dropped by Plutarch toward the end of the dialogue that "Egyptian mythology" is the key to the correct Platonic interpretation of Eros. A brief resume of the dialogue is in order. The Erotikos begins with an event which startles the dialogi personae and is intended to shock the reader. The beginning is typical of the more baroque style of Plutarch with its contrasts, movement, and theatricality differentiating it from the mostly static settings of Plato's dialogues on love, the Phaidros and Symposion.16 In Ovid's story of Procris and Cephalus, the aged Cephalus recounts to two youths how he loved his beautiful young wife but tragically slew her while hunting, mistakenly thinking her some beast. The time-frame emphasizes the contrast between youth and age, erotic passion and mature wisdom—a mood suggesting reflection and universalizing on a momentary experience of mutual happiness in the bloom of life.17 In the dialogue recounted by Plutarch's son, the author himself, now in advanced age, is, unusually, the principal character. He has brought his young bride to the festival of Eros, the Erotideia, at Thespiai, a town not far from his home, to offer prayers and sacrifice to the god—an event occasioned by her parents' bitter rift. The rrtise en scene, however, is the much of it mentioning Plutarch's Erotikos in passing, see, for example, E. Cantarella (trans., M. Fant), Pandora's Daughters.

On Xenophon, see Foucault, II, 116, 167, 248, 256; Goessler, 22. Xenophon, 8. 3, praises conjugal love.

Bacchon, the town's celebrated love (eromenos), had been contemplating marriage with a young and wealthy widow, Ismenodora. But being a minor he had asked for more experienced advice. The two referees, though, deadlocked, have entrusted the decision to Plutarch and his friends. A debate now ensues over the superiority of homosexual or heterosexual love—for boys or women—with each side denigrating the other, and over the relative merits of marrying above one's status. At that moment a friend gallops up to relate that not only has Ismenodora kidnapped the apparently willing Bacchon from the palaistra but her female friends have already dressed him in a wedding gown (himatiori) (754E-55A).19 The second important consideration is the assertion—in regard to the Platonic doctrine of love—that "dim, faint effluvia of the truth" are scattered about in Egyptian mythology (762A). This is not an isolated cadence, for at 764A Soklaros asks Plutarch to return to the Egyptian material: But as for your hint that Egyptian myth is in accord with the Platonic doctrine of Eros, you can no longer keep from revealing and explaining your meaning. We would love to hear even only a small bit of matters so great. Plutarch at this point, as in his essay On Isis and Osiris, alludes to one Egyptian myth identifying Eros with the sun and another identifying Aphrodite with the moon. He continues with his own explanation of the philosophical distinction between the sun, which belongs to the visible (horaton) and Eros, part of the intelligible sphere (noeton). The matter is dropped there, but it suggests Plutarch's reinterpretation of the Eros of Plato's "middle" period (Symposion, Phaidros, Politeia [Republic], and Phaidon).20 Moreover, Plutarch seems to "sign" his work. He apparently is referring here to the final speech of On the E at Delphi— which explains the distinction between the visible sun and the true Apollon 18 The feminism of Plutarch's dialogues is limited: women—even his wife and Ismenodora— should be heard (about) but not seen (or talk). 19 Goessler (27) discusses the dramatic techniques here. 20 See J.

Brenk, SJ. 463 Helios, the one and unchangeable God, whose image is the sun. He also seems to publicize a future Isis and Osiris, his treatise on Egyptian Isis religion. The vocabulary of the Erotikos and the tentative manner of broaching the subject appear to exclude an already issued Peri Isidos kai Osiridos. The reference reinforces the chronological relationship between the Erotikos and the Peri Isidos—dialogues most likely belonging to Plutarch's latest period of literary activity.21 We are only beginning to understand the status of women in the Early Empire. But Plutarch, with some ambivalence, certainly succumbed to the epoch's fascination for Isis. In his essay on the Isiac religion he transformed die central myth, the goddess Isis' search for the dead Osiris and resuscitation of her husband's body, into a Platonic allegory of the soul's ascent toward the Form of the Beautiful. But in his desire to metamorphosize the myth into a Middle Platonic allegory with Osiris symbolizing the Form of the Beautiful and Isis as his lover, he redirected the main thrust of Isis religion, which is centered on the power and omnipotence of Isis. In the light of On Isis and Osiris some of the more radical developments of the Erotikos receive sharper contours. Plutarch's most spectacular achievement—contrasting with Plato's Symposion and Phaidros—might appear to be the eulogy of heterosexual married love and, in particular, the element of reciprocity between male and female. But such a view was actually current in philosophical circles long before Plutarch. Such love was a popular theme in Roman literature—though often patronizing, humorous, or pathetic—for example, in Ovid. Plutarch's greatest achievement, then, was not the glorification of heterosexual—and especially married—love over homosexual or pederastic love but rather the introduction of heterosexual love into the Platonist's study—namely the ascent of the soul to the Beautiful in Itself, and a new anthropomorphic conception of the Beautiful as the final goal (telos) of the soul. Thus the calling card of the Middle Platonists, "assimilation to God" (6|khcogi&lt;; Gem) acquires a very literal meaning.22 21 See Flaceliere, 7-11; C. P. Jones, "Towards a Chronology of Plutarch's Works," JRS 56 (1966) 61-74 (66), and Plutarch and Rome (Oxford 1971) 34. Froidefond, 211-12, accepts Flaceliere's arguments. On Peri Isidos see G. W.

Such confusion has enormous consequences for the conception of three fundamentals of Middle Platonism: matter, God (Demiourgos or Nous), and the model (paradeigma or Form).23 In Plutarch's allegorical interpretation of the Isis myth, reflected in the Erotikos, these elements become terribly confused. Platonic matter (receptacle, potency, etc.) refuses to sit quietly at home while the Form of the Beautiful delights in its (his, His) new-found mind (logos, or nous). A corrollary—not fully developed by Plutarch but with a great future—is the divine love for the soul, a love going far beyond the mere paternal or providential love of gods or God in Greek religion or philosophy. The Form of the Beautiful, once only an object, rejoices not only in its new-found mind but also in its power to return or initiate love. But Osiris, who is identified with the Form, also has nous and is responsible for the creation of the world. Thus, Osiris is assimilated somewhat to the Demiourgos. Isis, who is matter, also has nous and as the object of Osiris' love assumes something of the function of the Form. The Platonic ascent toward the Form of the Beautiful as a passive intellectual object has been transformed by Plutarch into the reciprocal love of the soul and its telos, conceived of as both the Form of the Beautiful and a divine person. First, speaking of Eros as the soul's guide to the Beautiful he compares the god to the sun—in Plato and in Plutarch an image of the Form of the Beautiful. In the ever fluid and slippery allegorical interpretations of Peri Isidos, Osiris, too, like Eros, is the guide to the telos, or vision, and is compared to the sun. This Platonic aspect of the allegorical interpretation of the myth is also traditional. Once the inner dynamic of the Isis religion enters, the goddess becomes a very active element, analogous to the supreme divinity of the aretalogies. Even in Plutarch's minimalizing account, she is the driving force which discovers and reanimates Osiris' dismembered body, in love overcoming all obstacles, even the death of the beloved. The terminology for the divine union is that of Plato's homosexual or pederastic lovers. But we should not forget that even Plato treated Alkestis, who died for her husband, Admetos, as a supreme example of dedicated love, nor that her love, like that of Isis, overcame death (nor, perhaps, that it was Euripides who immortalized her). Isis, like the pederast, must be the active element; for the quest for the beloved precedes that for the Beautiful. Osiris corresponds first to the beloved boy, then to the Form of the Beautiful in the Platonic works. For the strikingly erotic union of the soul with the Form, Plato again was Plutarch's inspiration, but, as so often, the pupil outstripped the master. 23 Elaborated by S. M. Chiodi, "Tematica ierogamica nel De hide," Miscellanea plutarchea, 121-26, and "Demiurgia e ierogamia nel de Iside plutarcheo. Un'esegesi platonica del mito egiziano," SMSR 52 (1986) 33-51.

Brenk, S.J. 465 Subtle, perhaps unconscious, transformations occur in the elaboration of the philosophical myth as Plutarch replaces Plato's primarily homosexual model with a heterosexual one. Osiris (Form of the Beautiful) must according to the myth also be an active element, the eternal lover of Isis (receptacle, chora, matter, potency, etc.). Isis' ardent lover Osiris thus replaces the inanimate object—the passive, though divine and intelligible but not rational, Platonic Form. Reciprocity is extolled. Plutarch has not only betrayed Plato by creating a different function for the Form but has planted a time-bomb in Platonism, the acceptance by future Platonists of an equivalence between God and the Form. We can begin to discern the creeping metamorphosis of Platonic terminology. "Lovely" (erasmion, Erotikos 765D, F) reflects erasmiotaton used in Phaidros (250E) for the Form of the Beautiful, but "beloved" (agapetos, 765D) is an intruder. Also somewhat unusual is "dear" (philion, 765D). Combined, we find this remarkable description of the soul's reaction to the Beautiful: ". . . courting ... the truly lovable and blessed and beloved of all and dear" (to Epaop-iov aA-riGax; kou naK&amp;piov ical cpiXiov obtaoi Kai ayajrriTov, 765D), echoed at 765F: "produces a refraction of memory from that appearing beautiful here, toward the divine and lovable and in all truth blessed and marvelous Beauty" (... to Getov kou £pao|iiov Kai jiaicapiov an; aA.T|0co&lt;; ekeivo Kai 9au|idoiov KaXov).24 In the Phaidros we find "the desire and mystery of true lovers" (7ipo0a)|iia fiev oJv Tcov aq dXriGroi; epcovTtov Kai te^etti, 253C) but this is applied to human love.25 We do find, though, in relationship to "the divine Beautiful in itself, unique in form" (croio to Geiov KaXov |o.ovoei5e^) the ambiguous word "consorting with" (ouveivai, ouvovToq ocutcd, Symposion 21 ID, 212A), and following upon a pederastic context "yearn for Being" (opeyriTai Tot&gt; ovToq, Phaidon 65C), "love the truth [the true] (epav te tou dltiGotx;, Philebos 58D).26 Makarion, which has divine, eschatological, and erotic connotations in Plutarch, in Plato is applied to the vision rather than to the Form itself: "the blessed vision ("beatific vision") and sight" (|iaKapiav o\|/w te Kal 0Eav, Phaidros 250B), "of mysteries most blessed,. . . happy, straightforward appearances" (teA-etcov . . .

The erotic association of Isis with the Form of the Beautiful (Osiris) in the Peri Isidos comes from Plato's description of the passion of homosexual love, the prelude to real love—which in the Phaidros is reciprocal. At times this vocabulary, when used for the Form, is startling—even though it is more traditional than one might expect. For example we find "associating in beautiful things" (toT&lt;; KaXoii; 6(j.iAr|oa&lt;;, Erotikos 766B) and "this goddess also who participates always with the first god and is associated with Him in the love of the fair and lovely things about him ... in love . . . consorts with him . . . yearns for him . . . and being importunate over him . . .

Here, for Isis' love of Osiris he employs the phrase "the beautiful and fair things about him" (crovouaav epcori tSv 7tepi ekeivov ayaGSv Kal KaXSv, 374F-75A), where in the Greek of his period, for example, "those about Epikouros" can simply mean "Epikouros." Similarly the conduct of Osiris, who is equivalent to the supreme God and the Form of the Beautiful, is described in ambiguous language: "... of which end (telos) is the knowledge of the first and lord— whom the goddess encourages us to seek—beside her and with her living and consorting" (. . . rcap' au-ufi Kal |i£x' a-uT^ ovxa Kal cuvovxa, 352A). Makarion also takes on an erotic context. The soul's desire for the Platonic Form at Erotikos 765F is for "the divine and lovable and dear and 27 See C.

Professor Donini believes the Erolikos presupposes, and was chronologically close to, ■ Plutarch's De Facie in Orbe Lunae—especially evident at Erolikos 764D. In his view, Plutarch in De Facie 939E, 944E, and 945C already toys with sexual distinctions and erotic language for the female moon and male sun (as the image of the Good [Politeia] and supreme God and Father Begetter of the Kosmos [Timaios])- but he discovered in the Egyptian myth more fertile possibilities for sexual and reciprocal symbolism. Plutarch's allegorical interpretation was aided by virtually limiting himself to pre- or early Hellenistic sources (Griffiths, 75-100, esp. 84-85), where Osiris has more importance than Isis.</page><page sequence="11">Frederick E. Brenk, S J. 467 beloved ... Beauty" (theion, erasmion, makarion ... kalon)29 The phrase is not unlike that in Plutarch's treatise On the Face in the Moon, the final part of which contains an eschatological myth. Here intellect sees an image of the Form reflected in the sun. Intellect (nous) is separated from soul (psyche) through love of "the desirable and beautiful and divine and blessed" 0epheton, kalon, theion, makarion, 944E) "for which all nature in one way or another yearns" (opeyexai—another ambiguous term).30 Plato's impersonal descriptions of the Form—"the really real" (to ontos on), "of single form" (monoeides)—tend to disappear. Plutarch's hagnos (pure, holy, inviolable) joins the Platonic hieros (holy) and katharos (pure) in the context of the Beautiful: "the holy and sacred (hieros and hosios) Osiris," "the invisible and the unseen, the dispassionate and pure (hagnon) kingdom of Osiris" (Peri Isidos 375E, 382-83A). In Plutarch's romantic context the intellectual vision is not only, as in Plato, a mystery (telete) but also a marriage made in heaven, a hieros gamos,31 The language in some respects echoes Philo, the Alexandrian philosopher of the Julio-Claudian period, who also equates God with the Form of the Beautiful. On the Cherubim speaks of God being the summit and the goal (telos) of happiness (eudaimonia)—"blessed, incorruptible, bestowing on all from the fountain of the beautiful (Beautiful? [kalon]); for the things of this world would not be beautiful, if they were not impressions from the archetype, in truth, the uncreated beautiful, blessed (makarion), imperishable" (86). Or, "God himself becomes our hierophantes causing us to see the hidden beauties (kalle), invisible to non initiates . .. You souls, who have tasted the divine love(s) (theioi erotes), hasten toward the vision, which draws all eyes to itself..(On Dreams I. 164, 165); ". . . he entered into the darkness where God was, that is, into the unseen, invisible, incorporeal, and model essence (paradeigmatike ousia) of all existent things . . . revealing Himself a work like a painting, all beautiful and divine in form." (Moses I. 158). Some contemplate the "Uncreated, Divine, the First Good, and Beautiful and Happy (eudaimon) and Blessed (makarion),. . . that better than the Good and more beautiful than the Beautiful, and more blessed than blessedness, more happy, moreover, than happiness itself (. . . to Kpevcxov (iev ayaGoti, ica^A-iov 8e tcaXou, Kai (iaKapiOTtiToq (iev (laKapicbxepov, Eu8aijj.ov(a&lt;; 8e 29 Martin, "Amatorius," 492-94, 522. Whittaker, "Platonic Philosophy," 92, notes that— influenced by Timaios 87C—the couplet theion and erasmion appears as well in Alkinoos, Didaskalikos XXVII. 2 (180. 6-8) and may have been popular in Middle Platonism. 30 The term epheton is defined as Aristotelian in H. Cherniss and W. C. Helmbold, Plutarch's Moralia XII (Cambridge, Mass. 1968) 213, note g. But Whittaker, seeing its roots rather in Philebos 20D, observes that though Plutarch and Alkinoos—independently and alone among Middle Platonists—used it, it did not resurface until the Neoplatonists ("Proclus," 287-88). 31 Y. Verniere, "Initiation et eschatologie chez Plutarque," in J. Ries, ed., Les rites d'initiation (Louvain-La Neuve 1986) 335-52, esp. 338,346, 349, treats the mystery aspect.</page><page sequence="12">468 Illinois Classical Studies, XIII.2 evSaiiioveo-cepov. . .) and of anything else besides the above—should it exist—more perfect" (Embassy to Gaius 5)32 Plato's Timaios—on the nature of the universe—for which we have a long Plutarchan commentary, is responsible for some of the changes. Both extol logos and noeton. But though the Form of the Beautiful exists in the noeton, neither Plato nor Plutarch in his commentary attribute logos to the Form. Logos belongs par excellence to the Craftsman-Creator, the Demiourgos. Plato's own thought on creation was obviously obscure. The elusiveness of God in Plato elsewhere and the tendency of Platonic philosophy after him suggest that his Demiourgos belongs to an Einsteinian understanding of the intelligibility granted matter. The kosmos itself contains a kind of intelligence or power of evolution and self organization—albeit, a rationality (logos), unlike that of the Stoics, physically separate from matter. But outstanding commentators on the Timaios, both ancient and modern, have interpreted the Demiourgos not merely as an allegorical representation of the intelligibility shaping matter but as a non-anthropomorphic mind (nous) responsible for the evolution of the cosmos.33 In any case the line between the complex of Ideas, the intelligible universe (kosmos noetos), and nous had begun to wear thin by Plutarch's day. His simplifying approach to Plato, combining elements from disparate passages, though cautious in its terminology, radically transforms the impersonal telos of Plato into an anthropomorphic, even erotic God. The Isis myth may have led him whither he willed not, but the pretext of an allegorical interpretation allowed him more freedom in expressing his new concept of God than would a strictly philosophical exposition. At least, in the allegorical interpretation he appears more radical than elsewhere. Heterosexual love, as in the old cosmogonic myths, begins the universe. The love of Isis and Osiris—who apparently had studied Plutarch's commentary on the Timaios—generates their child Horos, an allegory for the kosmos. Divine love becomes the paradigm for human love. Thus, human aphrodisia receive a new philosophical and religious dimension. Human love becomes a reflection of the quasi-eternal divine 32Philo texts those of R. Amaldez et al., eds., Les oeuvres de Philon (Paris 1963-1972); see XXXH, A. Pelletier, Legatio ad Caium (1972) 64, note 2, for parallels here. J. Dillon, "The Transcendence of God in Philo: Some Possible Sources," Center for Hermeneutical Studies 16 (1975) 1-8, with responses by G. E. Caspaiy, 9-18, and D. Winston, 19-22, is an excellent discussion of this knotty problem. Similar to Philo and Plutarch is Alkinoos (Albinos), Didaskalikos X. 3 (164); see Invemizzi, 26, and Whittaker, "Platonic Philosopy," 102-10. 33 Discussion in Brenk, "Imperial Heritage," 262-75, esp. 263, 268-69; add J.

Hershbell, "Plutarch's 'De animae procreatione in Timaeo': An Analysis of Structure and Content," ANRW II. 36. 1 (1987) 234—47, esp. 235-38.

Brenk, S J. 469 love which begot and continues to beget the world and all within. The aphrodisia are not simply the Epicurean sensual motions constituting sexual pleasure—so well described in the verses of Lucretius' De rerum natura— motions deprived of mystery and religious significance. Rather, they hint at the soul's eternal destiny. An image of the love which generated Plato's most perfect kosmos, they aid in the philosophical ascent. In marriage, though, as in Plato's myth of lovers, human love must deepen. With the passage of time the more sexual or sensual aspects of love should cede to a purer and more intellectual appreciation of the other's true beauty. Marriage, then, initiates Platonic love—conceived, however, not as a movement toward an impassive Form but for a responsive Lover. Ring composition, appropriate to this Greek setting, will hopefully swing us back where we began, to the tale of Ismenodora and Bacchon. In her love for Bacchon, Ismenodora, like Isis, is the driving force. Her name, though indicating force (is, menos), also suggests Isis. As beautiful and lovable, the boy Bacchon represents the Form of the Beautiful, the destiny of the true lover. His name—a form of Bacchos—suggests Dionysos, the Greek name for Osiris. Passive in receiving her love, once she has taken the initiative, he also actively returns it—becoming even more assimilated to Osiris, the god of reciprocal love.34 A simultaneous plot, leaving the resolution in doubt until the last minute, parallels the denouement of the philosophical inquiry. The literary medium is that of On the Daimonion of Sokrates. The theme of this dialogue is the nature of Sokrates' daimonion ("the divine," or "supernatural"—not really "genius"), but through the dialogue the exciting events of the Theban insurrection under Epaminondas against Spartan rule are woven. The Ismenodora-Bacchon tale, commencing and finishing the dialogue, is not extraneous. The Erotikos is played out against a backdrop of the visible love of Ismenodora and Bacchon—the horaton, so to speak— while the noeton, the invisible hierogamia with the now personal Beautiful, embraces the logos of the participants. Such a hierogamia is the telos of each true lover. The female's aggressivity in the quest for the Form of the Beautiful (Bacchon, Osiris), then, is the underlying thread of the "phainomenal" romances which close the work. As in the entire Plutarchan corpus, divided between philosophy (Ethika) and lives (Bioi), real events balance against theoretical speculation. Plutarch's examples of heroic women are notable too in not being limited, like those of Plato, to Athens or mythical Greece. Rather, geographically 34 Professor Barigazzi notes the real etymology of the heroine's name—"gift of Ismenos," (the river of Thebes). Dionysiac associations may be intended; cf. Euripides, Bacchai 5: "I have arrived at Dirke's streams and Ismenos' water." Naturally such connotations add to the mystical eschatological orientation of the Erotikos, besides linking "Ismenodora" to "Bacchon." Plutarch omits at this point the role of Bacchon as Eros-mystagogue, leading Ismenodora to the Idea (Form) of the Beautiful.</page><page sequence="14">470 Illinois Classical Studies, XIII.2 they reflect the universal breadth of the Graeco-Roman world. In tone, too, they breathe a realism not so evident in the world of Plato's dialogues. Camma, who avenges her husband by drinking a poisonous toast with his murderer, is from Gaul. So is Empona, who ostensibly mourning her dead husband, mates with him in his underground hiding place and bears him sons.35 The quasifictional character, Semiramis—whose assassination of Ninos is related earlier in the dialogue—is Assyrian. With the exception of the Semiramis story, the tales of female virtue or courage—of Camma and Empona and their husbands—are in fact traditional depictions of womanly virtue. Still they underscore the courage and tenacity of women dedicated to a beloved husband. Above all Ismenodora and Semiramis, who assume male roles, symbolize the new erotic dialectic.36 One, in abducting Bacchon, assumes the role of Herakles—the epitome of masculinity and philandering. Semiramis, only the maid and concubine of a palace slave of Ninos, becomes through her intelligence a Klytaimestra, not only contriving the execution of the king and ruling in his place but winning Plutarch's approbation. The other accounts, though, besides being illustrations of courage and nobility—demolishing the denigrations of pederasts—contain primary Isiac themes: a wife's search and mourning for her dead or assumed to be dead husband, the bearing of children to the "defunct" (Empona); revenge for murder (Camma), and undying, married love triumphing over death and the grave. Essential to the dialogue is the counterpoint in themes of harmony and disharmony—not surprising where the Muses and Eros invisibly preside. The dialogue begins with the dissonance between the parents of Plutarch's wife, the event bringing the young couple to Thespiai. There follows the strange resonance between Ismenodora and Bacchon, the disharmonious arguments deadlocking the referees, the choros of the friendly circle of Plutarch, the discord of their arguments, the harmony of Ismenodora and Bacchon, which turns abduction into marriage, the return to the disharmony of the arguments of homo- and heteroadvocates, the accord of Ptolemaios Philadelphos ("lover of his sister") and his concubine Belestiche, the sour note in the love story of Ninos, assassinated by Semiramis, the wedding preparations of Ismenodora and Bacchon soon to be celebrated in song, followed by the Roman Galba's resignation to his wife's strident infidelity, the sun's and moon's tuneful progression, and the harmonious finale, the undying loves of Camma and Sinatus, of Empona and Sabinus.37 35 Recounted in Plutarch's Mulierum Virtules 257E-58C (Flaceliere, 152); see also Stadter, Plutarch's Historical Methods, 103-06; on Empona, Flaceliere, 154-55. 36 Flaceliere, 138; A.

Brenk, S J. 471 In conclusion, the philosophical originality of the Erotikos consists not particularly in its egalitarian treatment of love and marriage. Rather the evaluation of marriage, including sexuality, in the ascent toward the Form, and the identification of the Form with a loving God are its revolutionary aspects. The powerful expression of the dialogue, however, emphasizing striking contrast with Plato's Symposion and Phaidros conceals the more radical philosophical message.38 Pontifical Biblical Institute, Rome 38 Thanks are due to Professors Christopher J.
