<plain_text><page sequence="1">Islamic Studies 39:1 (2000) pp. 91-101 Discourse Between Science and Religion: The Way-out ' NAUMANA AMJAD To start with one may ask: why should there be any discourse between science and religion? This question arises because religion is the carrier of primordial Truth which encompasses all levels of Reality whereas science is a body of knowledge about the natural order based on empirical inquiry which concerns itself only with the verifiable data attained through sense knowledge. Moreover, science is a process and is subject to change whereas religion is based on verities and principles that are immutable. A dialogue between the two systems, one based on revelation and the other on human reason, would therefore be very uneven to start with. Why are we, then, driven to initiate this dialogue? As Tage Lindbom argues, even though our knowledge of a superior reality is intuitive, it has to be transferred onto the mental level in order to become conscious. It has to be translated into a mode that reason can grasp.1 Thus the encounter of human reason or rational thought with religious experience is inevitable. But there is no opposition between intellect (intellectus) and reason {ratio) as long as the latter submits to our consciousness of a superior and transcendent truth and accepts its function. I The conflict between religious consciousness and human reason is mainly an outcome of secularization. When the intellect is weakened, a larger field of action is made available to the rational faculties. Reason fulfils its lofty function as long as it is subordinated to intellectual knowledge. Intellectual or inner vision of learned and pious men has been absorbed by reason throughout human history. It may be added that it was precisely this intuitive vision which produced monumental treatises on wisdom which remain irreplaceable till this day. If the link between intellect and reason is severed, the latter alone would The paper was originally presented at the seminar on "Islam and Science: Religions and Scientific Perspectives on Life and Cosmos" held in November 1999 in Islamabad under the joint auspices of Islamic Research Institute, The International Institute of Islamic Thought, and Templetion Foundation. lTage Lindbom, Tares and the Good Grain (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 1988), 42-43.</page><page sequence="2">NAUMANA AMJAD not be able to unravel the truth. Hence it will either remain enmeshed in confusion (which is the fact with most of the post-Renaissance philosophy) and leave many things unexplained, or deny the higher truths (which is implicitly what modern science is doing). What happened to the Islamic worldview through science was one consequence of this. The loss of the sense of the sacred that the philosopher of science, Huston Smith, laments about is another.2 Ratio was rushing in where intellect alone could tread. If the role of tntellectus as the superior most receptoire of knowledge is understood, things become much more clear. If we cannot expect to detect sound through receptors in the nose and will not dream of seeing through the tongue — our organ for taste — why should reason be expected — and that too independently — to access knowledge of Divine Truth? But once reason was seen as the best tool available for discerning reality, anything it could not grasp had to fall out of the repertoire of valid knowledge. The crowning of reason started with philosophy and penetrated the social sciences and humanities. It was in natural sciences, however, that it was to find its strongest foothold. Natural sciences were considered inferior to philosophy in the Islamic classification of knowledge. By claiming rational faculty as their only tool and then limiting the rational to verifiable, natural sciences were able to develop an exclusive merit of their own. Now they could break free and claim higher position for the rational faculty in the hierarchy of sciences. The history of this development deserves to be treated and at some length. Likewise, the relationship of reason and intellect demands a suitable treatment which is not possible in the present paper. The purpose of bringing up this point is to emphasize that the development of modern science and its challenges to Islamic thought are one link in a series of chain reactions which started with philosophical disciplines. In other words, it all started in the cognitive area; the way man thinks (or the way Descartes thought he thinks!). However, once this got started it could not be stopped; or could it? Seyyed Hossein Nasr speaks loud and clear on this issue: "Adoption of western sciences can only be carried out completely by absorbing its worldview, in which case the consequences for the Islamic view of reality, both cosmic and metacosmic, cannot be anything but catastrophic".1 Huston Smith says that science unhorsed tradition because science, or rather technology, is a great problem-solver, with unprecedented control over phenomena and this prometheanism needs a different epistemology.4 Closer to home, Muhammad Ajmal remarks that the halo of sanctity that surrounded proper religious subjects now flits with darker shades from data to hypothesis and from hypothesis to the methodology of 'Huston Smith, Beyond the Post-Modern Mind (New York: Crossroad, 1982), 145 and 247-256.

But in order that this partnership functions effectively, the inherent limitations of science should be kept in sharp focus.'' That, however, did not happen. In the aftermath of modern scientific achievements, we have generally overlooked the fact that science is a very restricted way of knowledge, legitimate in its own right but not beyond that. It is not uncommon to come across the use of the word scientific as a synonym for systematic. Secondly, science is taken to mean modern science (in its current paradigm) and not science as it existed in the pre-Renaissance period and throughout human history. So there is a lot which is out of focus here. A colleague at my university recently remarked about a book: "It is a brave attempt to criticise religion...." I think it would be a brave attempt to criticise science in the current situation. This "two-horned" topic has to be approached. I have borrowed this phrase from Hillman who says that intellectual exercise is purposeful only when it can approach and tackle " dangerous, two-horned" topics otherwise it is pointless to write/ Herein lies the rationale for the discussion that follows. But before attempting to address this task, a brief preface is in order. As sages say, first things first. II On a personal note, I am drawn to this discourse through an intellectual dilemma. During my quest for a traditional concept of psyche, I was made aware of the similarity between the concept of psyche in various religious traditions. Diverse terms were encountered but an underlying conceptual unity wove them together as if they were variant paths leading to the same summit. All descriptions of human self pointed to one fountainhead, one source, The One and Only. Secondly, the concept of self was inextricably linked up with the concept of reality and could not be understood without reference to it. Thirdly, the microcosm and the macrocosm — man and universe — were seen as hierarchical. The universe had multiple levels of existence or being, and man was capable of multiple levels of consciousness and was seen as composed of multiple levels of self, ranging from corporeal to spiritual. Essentially everything in nature, animate or inanimate, received its existence from a single Reality whatever each tradition chose to call it. Within Islamic thought all the different intellectual schools and disciplines — Kalam, the worldview of the philosophers, Gnostics or Sufis — all pointed to this Reality, the Divine 'M. Ajmal, "Muslim Contributions to Psychology", Studies in Tradition (Karachi: Primordial Publishers, 1992), 44. ''Huston Smith, Beyond the Post-Modern Mind, 144. 7J.

I entered the field of professional psychology carrying the above perspective, which implied that man was hierarchical in composition; mind had precedence over body, and spirit had precedence over mind. But the modern science of soul, which was my discipline, had no clue of this hierarchy. There was no sign of the certitude offered by the traditional viewpoint. Instead, all the current theories were and are horizontal, failing or refusing to take into account the vertical or transcendent dimension of man. This has happened because the paradigm of natural sciences has been unquestioningly accepted by Psychology. "The progress of natural sciences has lent great credibility to this epistemology and of course temptation has been overwhelming to reconstruct the sciences of man on the same model..."9 Denial of supra-terrestrial domains in physics and denial of higher levels of man's self in Psychology are positively correlated. Evolutionary theory reached us through biological sciences and has coloured all interpretations of human behaviour since then. Ill The reductionism and anthropomorphic character of modern science now characterizes the social sciences as well. Nasr describes the general view of modern science as reductionist, "which would reduce spirit to mind, mind to the external aspects of the psyche, the external aspects of the psyche to organic behavior and organisms to molecular structures. The man who knows and who has the certitude of his own consciousness is thus reduced to chemical and physical elements which in reality are concepts of his own mind imposed upon the natural domain.'"0 Modern science cannot acknowledge any transcendent reality because it proceeds through the empirical method and draws its power from controlled experiment. "An epistemology that aims relentlessly at control rules out the possibility of transcendence in principle.'"1 We can only control what is lesser than us. Mind can study bodily functions but what about the higher cognitive processes? The only thing superior to them is the spiritual center of man's being. Hence only spiritual consciousness can "observe" mind. If Such a "i am by no means simplifying or overlooking the divergent points of view in Islamic thought. Although there is agreement on essentials, there are some complex arguments on which the three major sources — Kalâm, theoretical Sufism and Philosophy — differ. These are what Chittick and Murata call complementary modes of human understanding.

Since reason can neither observe nor control spiritual consciousness, it was excluded from the list of the phenomena to be studied. Psychology by definition is committed to provide insight and understanding about a domain which eludes the scientific method or overflows it in all directions. The challenge posed by Jung's comment that studying psyche can never be objective has never been taken up by psychologists because, as Hillman points out, "the ideational process in Psychology is far behind its methodology".i: Huston Smith prefers to use the term 'pneumatology' for the science of the soul since the word 'psychology' as currently used denotes at best only half the ground covered by traditional psychology." It is interesting to note — and it is not merely an omission — that there is no separate name for a science of soul in the Islamic classification of knowledge; it is not ranked with 'aqlï (intellectual) sciences nor among the naqli or transmitted sciences. Its subject matter is partly to be found in Philosophy, Biology, Cosmology, and Medicine and above all in Alchemy and the spiritual disciplines. The limitations of secular Psychology exist because of the scientific status it has chosen to aspire for. By throwing in their lot with natural sciences, social sciences have gained recognition only as a marginal science but not respectability and have lost their meaningfulness in the bargain. Philosophy had suffered the same fate earlier.14 So far as the situation goes, science or what Smith calls scientism, has not only reduced all reality to a single ontological layer, but has dragged the humanities, social sciences and arts into the same error.1'' By reducing all reality to what is observable and verifiable, scientism advocated a single-layered view of reality. Traditionally reality, rather Reality, was believed to be multi-layered. Metacosm and macrocosm had many levels from terrestrial to Infinite and so had microcosm i.e. man who had corresponding levels of self, from corporeal to spiritual.1,1 For a true understanding of nature — both human and infra human — the myopia of modern science has to be corrected. Before searching for the corrective lenses, let us look at the restricted vision and what it presents. For a most precise description of the limitations of modern empirical science, I once again borrow from Huston Smith. According to him there are 12Hillman, Revisioniti^ Psychology, xii. ''Huston Smith, The Forgotten Truth (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 1981), 60. 14"Philosophy is no longer an attempt to find the spiritual stratum of nature but has become more and more concerned with explaining nature in purely naturalistic terms, reducing its reality to mere natural causes and forces".

(Smith's points are in italics, supplemented by my observations). 1. Purpose: Science does not look for final causes. Each event or phenomenon — if a scientist finds its explanation — is explained in terms of efficient cause. A further inquiry will mean asking why this cause was caused and so on . Science can not venture on this endless task. Whether the case be that of Galileo and falling stars or Kepler and light, the shift "from the mechanics of antiquity to modern mechanics (comes through)the.... separation of primary and secondary qualities,... the numerical and affective aspects of nature, to remove the language of volition and teleology, and to fortify the notion of 'impersonal', causal laws of motion."17 Behavioural science traces "purposive behaviourism" to instincts and conditioning, looking for the immediate cause at best. The cornerstone of scientific method is the systematic denial that "true" knowledge can be got at by interpreting phenomena in terms of final causes, that is to say of purpose." 2. Intrinsic and normative values: Science can deal with instrumental values but not intrinsic ones. Science can study 'what is' but will not venture into judgments about 'what should be'. I am reminded of how as students we were led to believe that normative is inferior to empirical. Keeping in mind the way the definition of science is presented in textbooks, the empirical certainly sounds superior. Lacking any criteria to define good and bad, the social scientists have replaced these words with desirable and undesirable. 3. Ultimate and existential meanings like what is the meaning of it all. This is perhaps less frustrating for natural sciences than for social sciences. A psychologist is certainly left staring at the myriad web of human nature with a feeling of inadequacy. "Science itself is meaningful from beginning to end, but on certain kinds of meanings-ones that are existential and global—it is silent."" 4. Qualities do not lend themselves to quantification and hardly to verification. When scientific methodology tries to ensnare them , they slip out like fluid from the sieve, leaving only grosser elements. Certain qualities such as tone or colours are connected with quantifiable substrates (light waves of varying lengths) but quality itself is unmeasurable. Psychophysical methods try to find a relationship between physical stimulus and psychological experience. But telling a student that the experience of the redness is due to a certain wave length does not facilitate the understanding of the experience. Similarly sensory thresholds are measured in exact units such as the pitch .associated l7Gerald Holton, "The Roots of Complementarity", Daedalus, vol. 99 (Autumn 1970), 102-3. Cf.

The way qualitative factors act upon the quantitative dimensions of phenomena is too complex for scientific methods to grasp. The truth science can reach is limited, more limited as it approaches homo-sapiens. Will it change its target or scope with time? Resorting again to my favorite author, Huston Smith says that in order for science to enter the domain it has not tackled so far, it will have to relax demands for objectivity, prediction, control and number which amounts to losing all its potency. He is of the opinion that science can be turned in a new direction but then it would cease to be what it is.20 The all too obvious achievements in the physical domain have won great esteem for modern science. It is difficult to see that once there existed another science which had a different end and used means different from those of modern science. One may rightly ask: Why did Islamic science not develop in the direction modern science has taken? The foremost thing to remember is that the purpose of the natural sciences in Islam was not to gain control over nature but to use the knowledge of the physical domain as a step towards understanding Reality. Nature carried signs of the Creator as well as symbols which pointed to the Divine Truth. "Islam in fact gives legitimacy to a science only if it is organically related to the knowledge of God's reality".21 The Islamic science preceded modern science in use of the experimentation and scientific method. "Quest of objectivity is not unique to modern science.... that the scientific method was widely practiced in Islamic sciences is a well established fact now..."22 Since epistemologies derive from motivations, the methodology was not developed in the direction of control. Secondly, according to Nasr, it was a considered choice. Take the example of the Muslim Astronomy's silence about the Copernican system. "As long as the hierarchy of knowledge remained preserved and intact in Islam and Scientia continued to be cultivated in the bosom of Sapientia, a certain limitation of the physical domain was accepted in order to preserve the freedom of expansion and realization in the spiritual domain".23 Apart from the fact that this explanation of Nasr is not wholly acceptable to the modern mind, the sacrifice of physical gain for spiritual concerns is also completely incomprehensible. The point I am trying to make is that Islamic science can only be understood by placing ourselves in that perspective. It is not something that can be done like changing channels on television or like exiting one programme and clicking on another. To use the contemporary computer vocabulary, are we installed with the 20Huston Smith, Beyond the Post-Modern Mind, 149. 21Osman Bakar, Tawhid and Science (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 1998), 63. 22Ibid„ 8 and 14. 2,S.H. Nasr, Science and Civilization in Islam (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 1982), 174.</page><page sequence="8">NAUMANA AMJAD template which can read this perspective? Let us try. In a metaphysical treatise, 'Umar Khayyam divides the seekers of knowledge into four categories. What follows is Nasr's translation of Khayyam's original text: 1. The theologians who become content with disputation and satisfying proofs and consider this much knowledge of the Creator as sufficient. 2. The philosophers and learned men who use rational arguments and seek to know the laws of logic and are never content with satisfying argument. But they cannot remain faithful to the conditions of logic and become helpless with it. 3. The Ismà'ïlïs and others who say that knowledge is none other than receiving information from a learned and credible informant. For in reasoning about the knowledge of the Creator, His Essence and Attributes, there is much difficulty. The reasoning power of those who accept thV final authority of revelation and those who struggle against it is stupefied. Therefore they say that it is better to seek knowledge from the words of a sincere person. 4. The Sufis who do not seek knowledge by discursive thinking but by the purgation of their inner being and the purifying of their disposition. They cleanse the rational soul of the impurities of nature and bodily form till it becomes pure substance. It then comes face to face with the spiritual world so that the forms of that world are truly reflected in it without doubt or ambiguity.... This is the best of all ways. Tell the reasoners that for the lovers of God intuition is guide not the discursive thought.24 Nasr, elaborating upon the classification of Khayyam, places seekers of scientific knowledge in the second grouping but differentiates between the different schools of philosophy like the Ishräqi, and the Peripatetic, both of which profess to be disciples of Greek thought. He further remarks that it may seem surprising that a man well versed in arts and sciences of his day should consider the way of the Sufis as the best way of acquiring knowledge. Considering the matter carefully, it can be seen that the language of 'Umar Khayyam is almost operational (cleansing and focusing the instrument of perception i.e. Heart on the Real ). In employing the right mode of knowledge the Gnostic ensures that intellection takes place in him immediately and intuitively. I think it is time to ask a few questions. Given that: • the ultimate Reality is imperceptible through senses and logical reason; • human beings have an imaginai and intellective faculty capable of discerning 24'Umar Khayyäm in Risalah-'i Wujüd, quoted by Nasr, Science and Civilization in Islam, 33.</page><page sequence="9">DISCOURSE BETWEEN SCIENCE AND RELIGION truth but this ability is not cultivated or activated in every human being; • that science provides only; restricted knowledge, a searchlight that only lights up the area under its scrutiny and is inadequate for a comprehensive view of reality; and • that Islamic sciences contained a holistic view of reality and knowledge which needs to be rediscovered. Given all that, how is the intellective faculty to be cultivated? And what about those who do not choose to or cannot cultivate this faculty? Are they to follow those who can? Who is the mystic-scientist of the millennium? The learned and credible informant? Will the scientist trust the wisdom of the philosopher? Will the empiricist kneel down to the Gnostic? I find this possibility difficult to imagine. IV There are two characteristic responses from Muslim scientists to the science religion dialogue that I have observed. First, avoidance, that is, a systematic denial that the polarity exists, and second, compliance with or acceptance of the scientific view. Both these have prevented them from objectively analyzing the limitations of modern science and both have something to do with the addictive nature of comforts and conveniences which technology, the offshoot of science, offers. Denial works by separating the personal religion from its intellectual aspect and thus segregates the domains in which science and religion operate. Science has nothing to do with faith; religion only works on faith so that they are mutually exclusive. According to a survey that I conducted, 70 % of a sample of Muslim scientists from a leading institution in science education in Pakistan believe that science and faith are two separate domains. Where do we go from here? Remember, it is only those questions which cannot be answered with precision by science that have any real significance as Schumacher tells us.25 Those who agreed that a polarity exits have no clear view of the solution. Most of them feel that if science contradicts an established religious belief, one can still occupy oneself in the lab and ignore the issue. 60 percent think that the theory of evolution is a scientific fact and only 55% have read any criticism of this theory. Being faithful to the scientific method, I further examined the research topics currently under microscope in the science departments of the same institution and found little trace of a discourse between science and Islam. They are going further and further into molecular units. There is no sign of 2SE.F.

"Scientists themselves are beginning to suggest that our haven may be nowhere in the space-time manifold since the manifold is itself derivative and relative. Our final move may be into a different dimension of reality entirely. David Böhm calls this dimension "The Implicate order..."26 There is something known as participant or selection bias in social sciences research. I see it operative in forums where dialogue between science and religion is initiated. By choice only those scholars participate in these discussions who are perturbed by the tensions between science and theology or religion. Those who stay away find it irrelevant or something that does not interest them. So, to a large extent, the discussion is generally conveyed to scientists who are already familiar with the issues. How is science being taught in the universities (the breeding ground of future scientists and intelligentsia)? Which worldview is implicitly transmitted to them or what confusions are created for science students? All this remains uninfluenced by these dialogues till such time that the policy makers of education are imparted this perspective and made alive to the issue. The syllabi of the sciences are devoid of the Islamic perspective on knowledge and no mention is made of Islamic cosmological principles. Science training does not provide an alternate worldview but just teaches to worship the demi-god of science. As a science student recently exclaimed: "They think you are primitive if you do not believe in a scientific theory"! There have been efforts for the last several years to evolve an indigenous model of psychology based on the view of "self" propounded by Islamic thinkers. We have found out that if we accept the Western therapeutic techniques, we have to accommodate the related personality theory and the majority of these theories present a horizontal view of man with total denial of transcendent dimensions of his self. After 14 years of wrestling with western modules and trying to find a détente, I have come to the conclusion that the point of reference needs to be altered altogether. Scientific theories emerge from a specific paradigm. They can only be understood within that paradigm. The error of looking at Ghazäli's theory of personality from the scientific paradigm is doomed to failure. It can only be understood in its own paradigm. So where is the bridge to reach across? It is my faith that bridges will be built by those who are equally conversant with modern science and its paradigms as well as with traditional doctrines; who can stand on a firm ground between science and religion and merely by turning their attentional gaze describe the premises of both the sides. The number of such people is very small but the only way to increase such 26David Böhm in Huston Smith.
