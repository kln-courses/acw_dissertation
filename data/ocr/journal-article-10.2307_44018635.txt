<plain_text><page sequence="1">FILM STYLES AND FILM MEANINGS Thomas Allen Nelson Style, in its broadest sense, includes all the important ways in which artistic "content" is expressed by the materials and forms of a given medium. When discussing how a work's content is organized or structured, we enter the area of rhetoric ; and when we detail how a work's rhetoric exhibits a system of rules and conventions and an orderly structure of relations, then we feel confident in asserting that as communication it embodies both a grammar and syntax . If we are discussing a literary work our task becomes one of describing and defining how abstract signs (words) either relate to concrete situations or generate images and ideas in our minds which then are capable of producing thought and feeling. In the criticism of fiction, for instance, we distinguish between mimetic styles which attempt to narrow the gap between signifier (words) and signified (world) and expressive styles like those of Hawthorne and Lewis Carroll in the 19th century or today's post-Nabokovian fictionalists, styles which assert a more purely intransitive or reflexive activity devoid of concrete reference. The metafictionalists, for example, claim that "realism" and related literary movements delude us into believing that words and reality occupy compatible ground, when in fact the first exists in a "world elsewhere" and both function according to separate laws.* Robbe- Grilleťs comment that "a work of art contains nothing in the strictest sense of the word" sums up what many critics define as the "moder- nist" or "post-modernist" (depending on whom you read) attitude toward the traditional emphasis on thematic content in realist fic- tion. 2 If, however, the discussion should turn to the issue of style in film, most people would argue for a less equivocal relationship be- tween a film image and reality. After all, the bare image has a "reality" because it exists to be viewed and, as Jean Mitry reminds us, the 1</page><page sequence="2">world's "reality" or concreteness is there, both before and after it has been singled out and scrutinized by a film's framing. 3 Film reverses the process of literary signification by its insistence that the real and the concrete are the prime-movers of any given system of cinematic abstraction. Because of this ambivalence between film as both a window and frame on the world, film practice and theory by 1930 had divided into two convenient stylistic categories: (1) the realist tradition of Lumiere-Griffith- Flaherty- von Stroheim which developed narrative and documentary styles consistent with the 19th century belief that an organic, autonomic reality existed in history and nature; and (2) the expressionist tradition of Melies, German Expressionism, and Soviet montage which affirmed that "reality" was best repre- sented in such hidden areas as poetic imagination, the unconscious mind, or the dialectics of history. Stylistically, this polarity was defined and distinguished by a fondness for principles of continuity and "seamless" verisimilitude on the one hand (invisible editing, synchronization of image and camera movements, realist mise-en- scene), and on the other an expressive and obtrusive manipulation of the spatial and temporal content of what was photographed (decor, lighting, angle, montage). By the 1950's, the battle-lines had been argued, refined, and validated by the theoretical essays of Rudolf Arnheim and Bela Balazs for Expressionism, Siegfried Kracauer and Andre Bazin for Realism. Since that period of aesthetic consolidation, one conveniently dated by the publication in 1960 of Kracauer's Theory of Film: The Redemption of Physical Reality , both the secure status of "facts" as an arbiter of truth and Freudian psychology, with its humanist concept of an internally organized self, have suffered further erosion from the impact of discoveries and theories in several investigative disciplines. Quantum physics now buttresses Einstein's rejection of the absoluteness of time and space by its demonstration that attempts to map a completely ordered cosmos are fu tile. ^ Psychologists more often than not tell us that the self lacks internal coherence and can best be described as a serires of identities, splintered into separate roles and masks, seen respectively as either a performer skating across the moving surfaces of life or a Proteus ready to "flow" and embrace new possibilities. 5 R.D. Laing, in particular, has popularized the notion that traditional concepts of madness and sanity cannot deal adequately with contemporary psychic conditions and that, in fact, certain schizophrenic tendencies are signs of a healthy rather than dysfunctioning personality.^ In literature, the early modernist reaction to what was perceived as this century's metaphysical crisis, namely the creation of private mythologies by such writers as Yeats, Pound, Eliot, Joyce, and Lawrence, has been ridiculed in recent years by John Barth and a group of writers identified by a variety of pre- fixes (metaparsurtransfictionalists) as "mythotherapy."^ Today, in fact, the interpretative impulse of any discipline or activity which stems from inclusive or total assumptive systems has been so devalued that large numbers of college-educated people prefer the "truth" of such pseudoscientific and paranormal fads as psychokinesis, astral projection, precognition, pyramid power, and astrology. 3</page><page sequence="3">No wonder that the masterpieces of the realist and expression- ist cinema inspire in today's viewer either the indifference of those masses uninitiated into the nuances of their styles and bored by the irrelevance of their content (those who have not taken a college film course), or the devotion of those few who nostalgically savor the manners and mores of an age less overloaded with subcultures and idiolects (those who have taken a college film course). It may be possible that while film Realism and Expressionism developed separ- ate stylistic identities- and that is the way we usually distinguish the differences between, say, the films of Eisenstein and von Stro- heim- they mined their content assumptions from the same field of reference. Both, in differing respects, testify to the durability of 19th century epistemologica! thinking: that faith is a system of rational correspondence between the dual structures of phenomena and the individual, between private experience and the facts of temporal reality, an equipoise between the self and the world, between depths and surfaces. Eisenstein 's expressive renderings of film space and time share an unlikely epistemological kinship with both the Teutonic stylizations of Murnau and von Sternberg on the one hand, and the naturalistic rigors of Flaherty and von Stroheim on the other. Al- though the stylistic modes differ (meaning that each can be defined by a distinct film language), traditional realist and expressionist films suggest a unity common to works which assume the existence of "total" or inclusive answers to life's apparent contradictions. Keaton's The Navigator (1924) and The General (1928), two masterpieces of American silent film realism, are as "scientific" and logical in their own way as von Stroheim 's Greed (1924), although Keaton posit« depth in the sentimental self while won Stroheim favors the deter- minisms of nature and society; yet, both filmmakers shared the assumption that surface reality attains significance, or depth, through an observable system of laws and correspondences and that in their films' total spatial and temporal structures a facsimile of that world was represented. Eisenstein 's stylistics may distinguish his films from those of his less expressive counterparts, but his commitment to a totalized world-view does not. He merely assumed that his version of "reality" reached farther beneath photographed surfaces than those of the realists. Similarly, German Expressionism's preoccupation with subjective worlds comforts rather than disorients us with its assertion that distinctions between sane and insane are still valid. Witness the psychological dualisms in Wiene and Mayer's Caligari (1920), Mur- nau's Nosferatu (1922) and his American Sunrise (1927), and von Sternberg's The Blue Angel (1929). All retain the High German admonition that the excesses of the libido must be curbed if psychic and social order are to prevail. While these film traditions express differing political and psychological values, and in so doing adopt appropriate styles, they are unified in their faith in totalized assump- tions and therefore are appreciated by today's viewer more for their styles of presentation and performance than their substance. In that respect, the traditional polarity of film Realism and Expressionism, as with other uppercase shibboleths of the past, provides us with little help in understanding contemporary film styles and meanings. Andre Bazin 's seminal essay on "The Evolution of the Lan- guage of Cinema," with its contention that depth of focus in the films 4</page><page sequence="4">of Wyler and Welles, and the absence of montage effects in Italian neorealism gave back to cinema "a sense of the ambiguity of reality," would seem to possess the kind of aesthetic clarity and relevance needed for an analysis of the miasma of today's film styles.** Bazin described the dangers in those films (mostly examples of film expres- sionism) which presupposed a unity of meaning in any dramatic event, and therefore by their very nature ruled out ambiguity. Yet, as I have argued elsewhere, Bazin 's humanist aesthetic remains consistent with a belief in reality's "wholeness," admittedly in this case one which values "complexity" and "ambiguity," and the filmmaker's role as that of a Moses mediating between medium and subject. 9 He believed that for every film subject, from Flaherty's explorations of primitive societies to Welles' Charles Foster Kane, from the complexities of dramatic space in Mur nau to Renoir, an appropriate (i.e., a priori) range of stylistic techniques either were available or would be created. Dudley Andrew, in his excellent biographical study, illustrates how Bazin 's preferences for certain films and film styles reflect a coherent metaphysical orientation: Beneath such concepts as the limitation of perception and the integrity of space lies a belief in the signifying power of nature. When a filmmaker puts a situation under the pressure of a controlled gaze, he forces "it to reveal its structural depth , to bring out the preexisting relations " (What is Cinema ?t 27)1® Bazin's repeated position that film should "reveal" rather than "add" to reality becomes a focusing aesthetic principle only in the assump- tive context of the sort of dualistic epistemology of the actual and imaginai discussed earlier. What important films of recent years, for instance, can be evaluated with such an a priori view of reality, even one like Bazin's which values mystery and ambiguity? Can film critics agree on so important and inevitably so private an issue? Probably not, and an important reason for this rare unanimity may be found in another principle crucial to Bazinian criticism. Because he believed that in the best films the content of a given reality dictated the important decisions of style and form, Bazin preferred filmmakers who sacrificed their personal perspectives to the "depths" and "complexities" of reality. For him, filmmaking was not a collection of subjects and styles, not even a history of great works and great figures, but a humanism, a medium "ontogenetically bound not to man, as are words, but to the outer universe. "H The individual filmmaker, therefore, does not create new meaning but frames "the fleeting crystallization of a reality of whose environing presence one is ceaselessly aware."!^ Paradoxically, Bazin's strongest legacy was expressed through a group of critics and filmmakers who spawned a revolution in criticism based on the axiom that great films are the products of auteurs. Prompted by the theories and films of the New Wave, we now either brazenly or tacitly accept the notion that the better films represent the achievements of individuals rather than a seance between an anthropomorphic universe and human medita- tion. Accordingly, the criterion of personal "vision" has been ap- proved as a valid approach to not only the works of such "Pantheon" directors as Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, Resnais, and Ozu, but even 5</page><page sequence="5">in the analysis of the most repeated of Hollywood film genres and subgenres. Witness the evolution of a populist critic like Pauline Kael and her vigorous campaign for Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, and a host of new Hollywood auteurs ; the critical attention lavished on commercial films directed by Peckinpah, Eastwood, and de Palma; and the elevation of selected cinemaphotographers (Sven Nykvist, Vilmos Zsigmond) and editors (Henri Colpi, Verna Field) to the status of collaborative auteurs. Could it be (and I repeat myself) that the informational glut created by the communications media since Bazin's death in 1958 has eroded all authoritative visions which pretend to encompass what we must describe in quotation marks and with private qualification as "modern reality"? Seymour Krim, who could just as well be descri- bing many of today's films and film styles, believes that reality itself has become "so extravagant in its contradictions, absurdities, violence, speed of change, science-fiction technology, weirdness and constant unf amili arity" that the traditional division between imagination and fact seems neither definable nor relevant. 13 Perhaps no more accurate description exists for the "normal" experience of film viewing en- joyed today: one where our emotions constantly are assaulted by mixtures of visual /aural style and technique (short-and-long-lens perspectives, deep and shallow compositions, naturalist and impres- sionist colors, the incorporation of wild sound with complex sound mixes); one which demands that we respond with intelligence and understanding to a content which more often than not implies that combinations within the surfaces of reality (of objects and actors, of sight and focus, of color and shape, of sounds and mood) may be more immediate and "real" than an older faith in rational corres- pondences in the depths of reality . Films today present us with a totally contingent universe, where images and sounds mean both nothing and everything, a world of total probability and zero signif- ication. Jean Mitry, perhaps the most important film theorist writing today, addresses in his Esthetique et Psychologie du cinema the need for a pluralistic film aesthetic which would account for a variety of styles and subjects: The aesthetic process of film joins a deep psycho- logical reality and satisfies our desire to understand the world and each other in a powerful yet necessarily partial way. The aesthetics of film is based on this psychological truth and need. And so cinema is the greatest of the arts because it meets this need by showing us the process of the transformation of the world. The other arts can show us merely the end result of such transformation, the humanized art world. In cinema human beings tell each other what reality means to them, yet they do so through reality itself, which surrounds their work like an ocean. 14 If I understand Mitry correctly, he believes that all narrative films both reveal reality (the humanist view) and organize it into signifi- cances (the modernist view); that, to use an important distinction legitimized in recent studies by Louis Giannetti and Leo Braudy, film by its very nature is "open" (Realism's Window on the World) and 6</page><page sequence="6">"closed" (Expressionism's Framing of the World). Mitry contends that while the filmmaker cannot rid himself of reality, he must of necessity insist upon his use of it. Reality has no "totality" which film must serve and represent; rather than possessing a natural order of surfaces or depths, as Bazin believed, reality in Mi try 's view stands in a state of contingent readiness for the enrichment of human intervention. As a result, film cannot avoid the aesthetic consequences of reality's concreteness, its thereness , nor can it eviscerate the presence of homo signifier. Mitry 's synthesis of the humanist (psychologie) and modern- ist (esthetique) traditions may provide a model for the kind of eclectic but coherent discourse which film criticism requires in a period of stylistic and conceptual transition. Consider for illustration the famous blowup sequence in Anton- ioni's Blow-Up (1966). Thomas (David Hemmings), the photographer, believes that the "truth" of that park episode with the woman (Va- nessa Redgrave) will become clearer the more he gazes at his black- and-white blown-up stills; that, like the Bazinian artist, he can reveal through his art the mysteries beneath reality's surfaces and expose them to the light of human understanding. We realize, of course, that in fact the truth of the park was revealed earlier by Antonioni's objective camera as it watched from a distance the woman's flight past the bush where, if we were attentive to the details of the film image, the body of her murdered lover could be seen. Ironically, Thomas's first blowup of that scene clearly shows the body, even though he does not notice it until much later in a second, more distorted blow- up. As Thomas's trained photographic eye fails him a second time, Antonioni implies that his sudden excitement over the pictures has little or nothing to do with an artist's exploration of reality. We soon discover that in itself the park episode was not ambiguous, but only becomes so in the way it affects Thomas's private consciousness and in the role it assumes within Antonioni's larger film. As he contemplates the line of blowups before him, and Antonioni's camera from behind them shows his shadow enveloping them, Thomas realizes they are out of sequence. Significantly, the still showing the woman in closeup running toward the voyeuristic photographer is the one misplaced- significant, because it suggests Thomas's romantic involvement in the scene (earlier, he simulated lovemaking while photographing a model) and further documents his avowed dissaffection with both his professional and private life. After he rearranges the pictures into their proper spatial and temporal sequence, the camera tracks across them and shows us an altered stylistic version (black-and-white instead of color, frozen instead of moving images, fragmented as moments rather than edited for full continuity) of the scene viewed earlier. Importantly, however, the meaning of that episode has not changed, only our understanding of Thomas's character. With a magnifying glass, Thomas inspects one frame and discovers a figure in the bushes holding a gun. Antonioni fills the screen with this grainy, unfocused image, just as Thomas initiates a process of interpretative distortion. When he assumes that his inadvertant appearance in the park was responsible for "saving" a man's life, Thomas loses credibility as an artist for his failure to perceive what Antonioni's camera and his blowups have shown us: that the truth of the episode in the park was there to be seen; and 7</page><page sequence="7">according to Antonioni's reflexive cinema, what is more hackneyed in film as well as life than a woman, a lover, and a murder? If we fail to perceive that human truth, one as much an aspect of surface reality as those natural and painted London landscapes (and in which the murder takes place), then, like Thomas, we may drown in the illusory mystery of that world and misapprehend the nature of its complexity and fascination. To properly understand a film like Blow-Up, we have to rethink the kind of analogic reflex which presupposes that the ar- rangements of cinematic space (images) and time (narrative) are referents to an invisible but viable world. Such a notion, of course, represents a partial truth. Like Thomas, Antonioni takes pictures of things which by common sense can be confirmed as real. Thomas's pictures of the old men in the doss house, for instance, starkly reveal a human condition and therefore are brilliantly real, but that hardly defines the role they play in his or Antonioni's world. For Thomas, the doss house provides scenes of "violence" for a book which ironic- ally he plans to conclude with the more "peaceful" pictures from the park. The pictures in themselves have no "meaning" for Thomas (they are what they show) until he places them within a sequenced order which is just as fictional as Antonioni's film, but not as imaginative. The fact that Thomas does not respond to the plight of these men tells us a great deal about his professional detachment and emotional poverty, and prepares us for his mistakes of perception and under- standing during the blowup scenes. Antonioni, in contrast, demands we see things for what they are and his film for what it is. His state- ment that the primary subject of Blow-Up concerns the ability "to see or not to see properly the true values of things" provides an important insight into the film's much debated ending.*® When Thomas joins the imaginary tennis game played by the mimes, he does so in concert with both Antonioni's camera and sound track. The camera follows the "ball" as it rolls in the grass beyond the spectating Thomas, who then goes over and "picks" it up and "throws" it back to the players on the court. As the camera shows Thomas watching the game, we hear the subjective sound of the "ball" hitting the imaginary racquets and realize that Thomas has retreated once again into the controlled world of pretense. His encounter with something real (a murder in the park and his own angst) proved unsatisfactory because he could not convert that experience into private truth or public art: the pho- tographer who records and captures the real fails to become the artist who creates out of the actual a meaning which both can validate a psychological condition and communicate an aesthetic transformation of the world. Antonioni moves up and away from Thomas, literally dissolves him from a place in the film's narrative, and returns to us the world as it is, a complex surface of color and shape, sound and silence, standing in readiness for a part to play in one or many of our created scenes. Antonioni's cinema of self-reference asserts itself even more emphatically in The Passenger (1975). 16 The fact that within this film we have a character named David Locke (Jack Nicholson) who, as he says to his double Robertson (Chuck Mulvehill), is "putting together a film on Africa," and another named Martin Knight (Ian Henry) piecing together from the former's own footage a documentary 8</page><page sequence="8">portrait of that same man, strengthens on the most primary level patterns of narrative doubling and inversion. Significantly, those scenes with Martin, reminiscent of those with Thomas in his develop- ing room, take place in an editing room: a setting which at once telescopes the processes of film time and provides Antonioni an opportunity for ironic comment on the similarities between factual and fictional filmmaking. Martin, even less imaginative in his medium than Thomas was in his, ends up making sense out of the scattered shards and film strips of David Locke's life by turning to the journal- ist's existing codes. While showing us on Martin's moviola a brief segment from Locke's film interview with an African president, Antonioni forces us to see its truth through his fictional order of perception: he cuts to a flashback of this interview, an act carried out in his own editing room, and juxtaposes the film on the moviola with his own. Similar to the differences between Antonioni and Thomas as photographers in Blow-Up , here we see that Antonioni's camera is as objective as Locke's but not as narrowly focused. His allows us to see beyond the frame of the interview, and its catalogue of political cliches, to surroundings- both landscape and milieu- which enlarge and alter our definitions of filmed reality. Interestingly, this flashback indicates Locke's awareness that the President is a "liar" as we per- ceive that his method of filmmaking, like Thomas's, may be more fictional and less honest than Antonioni's. Through such complex and reflexive maneuvers, Antonioni's recent films continue to raise questions crucial to an understanding of relationships between film content and style, while minimizing the practical benefits to criticism of traditional Realist/Expressionist film aesthetics. While both Blow-Up and The Passenger encourage the audience to recognize and feel for Thomas and Locke's tragic aliena- tion and entrapment within the psychology of rigid professional systems, they likewise demand we put aside our involvement with the smaller focus of film content and appreciate its alignment through style to creative film imagination. That objective camera in The Passenger , besides enlarging perspectives beyond that of the main character, records and fixes the presence of a very real world, one comprising both objects of beauty and ugliness. On a number of occasions, the camera pans or tracks away from the complications of film content: after Locke's Land Rover has become impossibly mired in sand, the camera pans right for a look at an African desert devoid of man, machine, or words; in two separate scenes, the camera in- explicably pans up a wire on a white wall, the first time showing black insects crawling over a switch and cord which power a monotonously circular ceiling fan, and the last up another wire which leads to a painting of a romanticized landscape; and finally, in separate, but related scenes, Antonioni has the camera make an important circular journey- on the first occasion it pans left and away from Locke intently changing passport photos to a window which looks out onto a terrace and the desert beyond, and where we witness the sudden entrance into the frame of Robertson (although first mistaken for Locke) as we listen to the two men's taped conversation: this fusion of taped and visual flashback continues after a cut to the terrace with both Locke and Robertson talking, then the camera returns inside with Robertson, and concludes with a pan right and return to a 9</page><page sequence="9">glimpse of Locke in present time working over the passports. And, of course, the ending sequence of the film contains that complex five- minute circular track through Locke's barred window, during which time he is murdered by agents from the same African nation which provided the film with its initial setting. Importantly, these unex- pected and noticeable camera movements have no discernible sym- bolic connection to the principle events of the film's content, just as Antonioni's vision of the park scenes in Blow-Up differs from that of his protagonist. Those insects crawling across the wall in Locke's hotel room or the vastness of natural landscapes may be indifferent to his plight- and only a narcissistic or imprisoned self assumes other- wise-but they do provide, as the film's repeated use of Gau dian architectural settings exemplifies, the raw material for a creative rendering of the world's myriad shapes and appearances. Because Locke, like Thomas, lacks the necessary imagination to perceive the unavoidable disparities between the mirror world of self and the expressive possibilities found in both the created and natural land- scapes of the visible world, he repeats that story of the blind man who only sees ugliness. That final camera movement in The Passenger, in its virtuosity as important to film history as Renoir's 360° turn around the court- yard in The Crime of Monsieur Lange (1935), expresses a basic aesthetic paradox: that while visible reality may exist as an inex- haustible source of human meanings , and therefore satisfies our psychological and aesthetic need for transforming experience into the stuff of truth, it simultaneously betrays us in our search for a mean- ing. It visually embodies, as does the film's final high angle stationary shot of the Hotel de la Gloria at sunset, the continuation and durabil- ity of the life process: in its blending of different lines of movement; in its depiction of the old and young; in both its isolation of the girl (Maria Schneider) and her continued association with a pluralistic universe beyond the self; in its passengers arriving and departing; in its suggestions of journeys, destinations, and chance meetings outside the barred window frame of Locke's fate; and in general its expression of those random and accidental motions in human experience which alternate with and balance deterministic intrusions. Significantly, this shot reinforces the girl's capacity for not only looking through win- dows, and thereby indicating her concern for life, but, like Antonioni's camera, giving herself over to those vital and expansive surfaces (she studies architecture and "all the shapes we make") which exist beyond single frames of meaning. Stanley Kubrick is another filmmaker whose career, in suc- cessive stages, has challenged accepted definitions of cinematic lan- guage. As early as The Killing (1956) and Paths of Glory (1957), even before the impact from Europe of Godard's Breathless (1959) and Resnais' Hiroshima , Mon Amour (1959) was felt, Kubrick shows signs of developing a film rhetoric and style which work on levels separate from the conventional but necessary dictates of story and character content. In the first film, the voice-over narration recalls the kind of newsreel authenticity which Welles so effectively parodied in the "News on the March" sequence in Citizen Kane (1941), except that Kubrick extends this standard narrative device into a form of reflexive storytelling. The narrator of The Killing knows the exact times when 10</page><page sequence="10">the film's principal characters do things and in general the mathemat- ics of an objective world which, in its transparency, becomes acces- sible to the calculations and designs of human intelligence. His role in the film's central action parallels the announcer's at the racetrack, a second disembodied voice heard in repeated cadences, and both are expressions of a faith in the mechanism of regularity and predict- ability. The Landsdowne Stakes envelops the elements of chance within a closed system- its running is organized in space and measured in time (at approximately 3:45 p.m., on a circular track, a mile and a half)- and as a result it can be exploited or disrupted by competing systems not part of its reality. Johnny Clay (Sterling Hay den) and his robbery plan enter this world and, similar to the effect of an alien substance introduced into a functioning organism, call into question its raison d'etre. As we watch Johnny in a clown's mask realize the success of his intricately timed and spaced design, we hear the racetrack announcer's confusion over the shooting of the horse and his conviction that "exact information" will be forthcoming. Simultaneously, other events and plots orbit around this single conjunction of race and robbery: George (Elisha Cook, Jr.) plans to kill Johnny after the robbery as revenge for an imagined infidelity; Sherry (Marie Windsor) and Val (Vince Edwards) wait with their counterplan to steal the money from the robbers; the sniper Nikki (Timothy Carey) is killed because he did not have "time" to accept the generosity of a black parking lot attendant; and Marv (Jay C. Flippen) gets drunk and endangers the success of the robbery because of his homosexual attachment for Johnny Clay. Such forms of narrative doubling and repetition suggest on a rhetorical level Kubrick's view that life in time is comprised of several intersecting and inherently opposing forces. Johnny Clay's attempt to control time for the period of his robbery scheme fails because in any given moment too many factors, psychological as well as temporal, are at work within a contingent universe. Like the games of chess which define his friendship with the wrestler Maurice (Kola Kwariani), Johnny's plan in its purest form expresses a repeated desire by Kubrick's characters for a reality which at once is finite and formal: where the contradictions of space and time respond to the organiza- tional genius of individuals and align themselves into complex har- mony for aesthetic inspection. Stripped of his plan, Johnny in the end flees into the shadows of an accidental and disparate environment, where such trivial events as a suitcase's lock and a woman's poodle conspire to determine his fate. The film's last image of three human figures lined up and closing in on Johnny and the camera, repeating a composition seen earlier at Nikki's firing range (of cardboard G-men targets), reminds us of an artistic design which guarantees its own success at the expense of Johnny's failure. We are left to appreciate Kubrick's transformation of the cliches of a Hollywood genre (e.g., film noir1 s paranoid romanticism) into new film meanings. Camera movements, compositions, and setting combine in Paths of Glory to form what surely is a small film classic. ^ Every- where we look in the film there are paths leading nowhere but to death, forms distorting the vitality of life, and examples of human intelligence wasted on the creation of psychological deadends and artful cages. In the film's first scene, a platoon of soldiers forms a II</page><page sequence="11">"path" for General Broulard's (Adolphe Menjou) entrance into a French chateau. That path leads to the spacious corridor of the palace and the petty ambitions of General Mireau (George Macready), which in turn connects to the horizontal trenches decorating the barren topography of the World War I battlefield. Kubrick's camera clearly delineates these separate but complementary settings: its subtle turns and movements within Mireau's apartment help frame for us the transparent machinations of a political maze, while the bold tracking shots in the trenches capture a world more dynamically in touch with the extremes of life and death but equally commited to predeter- mined courses. The ornate and spacious compositions within the chateau deceptively suggest an openness absent in the cramped intimacy of the trench, while in fact both are different paths in a single labyrinth. In the chateau, space and emblems of time and art combine to dwarf those characters in the present whose actions demonstrate their ignorance of both its beauty and its lessons. While in the trenches characters may face reality in all its existential sim- plicity, their choices are regulated by the combined absurdities and aesthetics of trench warfare. These two realms come together during the trial scene in a palatial room presided over by a painting which expresses in its enormity the reaches of human aspiration, while below, within the mocking shapes of military justice, we perceive that neither the vertical (chateau) nor horizontal (trench) lines of the film's mise en scene forms pathways out of an enclosed world of space and time; instead, each takes us, like Bowman's memory in 2001 (1968), into rooms without doors. Near the conclusion to Paths of Glory , we return to another path just outside the chateau, one which visually links the past tense of the palace with the present tense of trench warfare: a path which leads the prisoners past the chateau to the execution stakes; a path which encloses the humanist Dax (Kirk Douglas) as well as the generals; a path beautiful in its symmetry and fearful in its meaning. As Kubrick freed himself from a rigid adherence to the con- finements of traditional narrative and developed as a film artist interested in the complex disparities between style and meaning, he has moved toward a fuller exploration of his own talent and vision. The narrator of Barry Lyndon (1975), for example, stands as a refinement of Kubrick's earlier attempts at narrative disparity and distancing. Although the narrator (Michael Hordern) offers us a comfortable detachment from the struggle of Barry's rise and fall, one which allows for both scorn and pity, and provides an historical awareness which strengthens the sense of irony in the film, his om- niscience is seriously limited. His superiority to Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) and his milieu exists on a scale limited to the immediate history and circumstances of the film's story. He has access to know- ledge of Barry's ultimate ruin and sorrow, to the nuances of Barry's romantic intrigue with Nora (Gay Hamilton) and Quin (Leonard Rossiter), to the complexities of 18th century European politics, and in general to the simple dynamics of social intercourse. Significantly, he does not comment on most of what we see and hear ; he has no access to the cinematic order of which his narration is only a small part. Kubrick's use of camera and the film's compositions, its mise-en-scene , and a sound track which develops a baroque regularity 12</page><page sequence="12">of beat and recurring cadences, produce a grandiosity of form which could redefine prevailing concepts of the film epic. Barry Lyndon shows many of the characteristics traditional to a genre developed first by Griffith and the Italians, refined by Eisenstein and Russian theories of epic montage, and exploited for its full comercial value through bravura technical feats by such filmmakers as Abel Gance and Cecil B. DeMille: a display of innovative visual and technical skills, impressive formal compositions, rhythmic editing, and an actual or pseudo-historical ambience. Yet, as Kubrick himself has noted, while such films historically resulted in significant advancements in film technique and language, they rarely embodied meanings equal to their formal pretensions. In separate interviews, Kubrick asserts his belief that "Eisenstein is all form and no content, whereas Chaplin is con- tent and no form," and articulates what I take to be his primary goal as a filmmaker and his actual achievement in Barry Lyndon: "Obviously, if you can combine style and content, you have the best of all possible films. In part I of Barry Lyndon , Kubrick deepens the narrative disparities of the film through the use of reverse zooms which allows us to move into and away from both the absurdities of Barry's gradual rise and a complex mise-en-scene : which, in a series of impressive spatial and formal compositions, blend with the conceptual and transcend the temporal levels of narrative content. As the love tryst involving Barry, Nora, and Quin develops, Kubrick zooms back from the particulars of film content (Barry chopping wood, Nora and Quin holding hands, a pistol being prepared for a duel) to assert arabesque landscape compositions similar to those found in Gainsborough, a lyrical ordering of Barry's rural world which dwarfs and engulfs the temporal conflicts of that world. Because Barry fails to perceive such basic disparities between his rather ordinary aspirations and the expressive possibilities of his natural context, he, like Locke in Antonioni's The Passenger , lacks the necessary imagination to tran- scend his own fate. In subsequent scenes, Kubrick captures the aesthetics of 18th century warfare and dueling through a blending of reverse zooms and striking horizontal compositions. While Barry feels trapped within the confining rigors of military life, Kubrick allows us to see what he has referred to as "a weird disparity between the sheer visual and organizational beauty of the historical battles sufficiently far in the past, and their human consequences."^ The aesthetics of the zoom lens allow Kubrick to capture closeup the triviality, absurd- ity, and tragedy of various human entanglements, some of which collectively add up to what we call history, while from a distance it suggests to an audience the possibilities of new meanings. During Barry's fall in Part II, Kubrick moves him out of the context of candlelit comfort and social symmetry through a successive series of scenes in which the mise-en-scene declines in its artifice as Barry undergoes emotional and moral growth: (1) as Barry attacks Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) in full view of those he hopes to impress (and Kubrick brings hand-held cinematic commotion into their midst), he offends that society's sense of form and decorum, not its moral outrage, and precipitates his social downfall; (2) following his son's death, the final scene with Barry at Hackton Castle shows him being literally carried out by two servants, but only after the camera 13</page><page sequence="13">dwells for a final look at the symmetrical and ornate composition of a candlelit wall; (3) in a Hogarthian setting of static and composed sloth, but invigorated by the film's most extensive traveling shot, Bullingdon asserts his challenge to a slumping Barry; (4) next, we move to an abandoned church reminiscent of Barry's rural beginnings for the climactic duel where Barry commits his lone moral act and provides the rituals of dueling with a significant human content: at that moment when Barry refuses to fire on Bullingdon after the misfiring of his opponent's pistol, Kubrick shows his capacity to act independent of a fortuitous turn of chance; (5) and finally, we go to a small room at a local inn where Barry, silently playing cards (along with debt-paying a very important activity performed at a table) with his mother, must come to terms with a sorrow and tragedy beyond his understanding and that of a world ensnared within its own rational and mechanical formalism. Kubrick concludes Barry Lyndon's story within the film's only freeze frame as the camera reveals Barry from behind (no doubt a one-legged double for Ryan O'Neil), artlessly suspended in midair without either the support of good fortune or good form. Both Antonioni and Kubrick in their respective films have translated realistic worlds into original stylistic idioms. They have been willing to experiment with the traditional polarity of Realist and Expressionist aesthetics: they have crossed lines, mixed lenses, colors, and sounds into impressive film experiences; they have created new meanings within the dual structure of film time (narrative) and film space (images). Along with a group of European and American film- makers of recent years, they have made audiences more appreciative of the complex surfaces of both reality and the film image.20 Antonioni's expressive use of color and telephoto distortion in Red Desert (1964), for instance, provided a new definition of psycho- logical "realism*' in film, one not lost on Martin Scorsese in Taxi Driver (1976). There, we see that syle extended to a series of impres- sive night scenes with Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) where the play of light and color reflected on a windshield suggests the sensory attrac- tion of a psychotic 's private hell. Or consider how the totally credible period creations and re-creations of Kubrick's 2001 and Barry Lyndon , and the bridging of realism and speculation in the visual language of their camera work and compositions have educated audiences to both the shallow pleasures of a Star Wars (1977) and the paradoxical modernity of Werner Herzog's "historical" films. Or, from another quarter, how the elliptical editing styles made famous by Alain Resnais and New Wave filmmakers have altered concepts of film time. Notice how Richard Lester's Petulia (1968) blends zoom/tele- photo imagery with associative montage effects into a complex sensory experience. No doubt influenced by his cinemaphotographer Nicolas Roeg, Lester brings together a series of oppositions- Petulia's (Julie Christie) search for the "perfect" life of America's surfaces and Archie's (George C. Scott) dissatisfaction with its blan dness- which demonstrate that montage need not be as manipulative and unam- biguous as Bazin claimed. Roeg's directed films- Walkabout (1969), Don*t Look Now (1973), The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976)- re- peatedly employ extremes of style (lenses and montage, for instance) which break up the familiar continuities of space and time, but which 14</page><page sequence="14">do not so much assert a "depth" in the Eisensteinian sense as a fascination with the alternative meanings of combined images, with that Musilian sense of possibility. 21 What, then, has happened since Bazin's death twenty years ago to film style and film meaning? Employing the terms of another generation, films- like those of Antonioni and Kubrick- have become more "expressive" while avoiding the cul de sac of a closed formalism. And, lest we forget, filmmakers like Marcel Ophuls and Costa-Gavras continue to work within respected documentary traditions. Even there, however, we are impressed by The Sorrow and the Pity (1971) and State of Siege (1973) not so much because they tell us something new about history, but because they show how individuals can render history into moving (cinematic and emotional) images. Bazin's separa- tion of films and filmmakers into the polarity of Realism and Expres- sionism, into those directors interested in "reality" and those inter- ested in the "image," no longer provides a practical aesthetic in an age which as yet lacks an assumptive structure to explain how the formal ("closed") compositions of Barry Lyndon function within a realist mise-en-scene ("open"). What we need now is an understanding of this new film expressiveness, one which would permit us to discuss how style humanizes the contingencies of our experience into the meanings of film.

Mytho- therapy, for several characters in the fiction of Barth, Vonnegut, and Pynchon, becomes a strategy for identity survival and expresses a belief in the sense of possibility discussed by Robert Musil in his encyclopedic work, The Man Without Qualities (1930-1942): "Any- one possessing it does not say, for instance: Here this or that has happened, will happen, must happen. He uses his imagination and says: Here such and such might, should or ought to happen. And if he is told that something is the way it is, then he thinks: Well, it could probably just as easily be some other way. So the sense of possibility might be defined outright as the capacity to think how everything could 'just as easily' be, and to attach no more importance to what is than what is not," trans. Eithne Wilkins and Ernest Kaiser (New York: Capricorn Books, 1965), p. 12. In a passage particularly relevant to this paper, Burton Pike comments on the intellectual context of Musil's prescient novel: "It was a period in which man's moral core, his belief in the integrity of his qualities as an individual, seemed crushed by the ubiquitous impersonality of an efficient, mechanical technology (an aspect of the period eloquently summed up in the movies of Charlie Chaplin)- a period which kept the forms of earlier times in its architecture, its political institutions and social organiza- tion, but which seemed to have lost their content."

Hugh Gray (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), pp. 36-37. Bazin's placement of Murnau's Sunrise within his realist aesthetic indicates the flexibility of his criticism, although he does tend to neglect the film's expressionism.
