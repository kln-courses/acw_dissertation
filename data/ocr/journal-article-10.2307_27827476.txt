<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSPECTIVES By H. H. PLOUGH Evolution and Anthropology: A Centennial Appraisal, edited by Betty J. Meggers; 172 pages; $1.50; The Anthropological Society of Wash ington, D.C., 1959. TOURING the 1957-58 season the Anthropological Society of Wash ' ington planned its meetings under the general title of this volume, and invited a series of distinguished scholars to give successive lectures. The manuscripts were collected and are now published as the Society's contribution toward the celebration of the centennial of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species. The ten lectures, with an excellent bibliography, make a brief and attractive volume. In spite of several more pretentious and voluminous efforts, this seems likely to remain one of the most readable informative monuments to 100 years of Darwin's continuing influence. The implications of the doctrine of evolution for "man's place in nature" interested Darwin from the beginning, although at first he attempted to avoid the controversy which they aroused. Later he developed his views much further in the Descent of Man and Ex pression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. These volumes empha sized two major aspects of human evolution, the physical and the psychological. Although Darwin hardly mentioned the third aspect, cultural evolution, this was actually well-developed more than forty years before the Origin, as in Thomsen's recognition in 1819 of three ages, with stone, bronze, and iron implements, in Danish prehistory. While studies in the evolution of the physical and psychological aspects have continued since Darwin's time, it is interesting that for more than fifty years the mention of the evolutionary interpretation in cultural anthropology has been almost violently condemned. The widespread hostility was a reaction to the earlier somewhat uncritical applications of E. B. Tylor and L. H. Morgan. The persistent question ings of Boas, Radcliffe-Brown, and Goldenweisser resulted in labeling the early attempts to trace unilineal steps in cultural evolution as "pseudo-history," and the emphasis came to be placed on description and comparison of cultures. Diffusion alone came to be the key to an understanding of culture change. The lectures in this volume give an excellent review of the development of these views, and their current more accurate analysis in evolutionary terms. The first and one of the most valuable chapters, by Ernst Mayr, is called Darwin and the Evolutionary Theory in Biology. Two contributions 91</page><page sequence="2">92 american scientist of Darwin are widely recognized, namely, evidence of the occurrence of evolution, and the causal mechanism, natural selection. A third should be added, the replacement of typological by population thinking. Typological thinking follows Plato. There is an ideal type for each spe cies, and variations simply fail to realize it. For the populationist the type (average) is an illusion, and the significant fact is the range of variation. When this distinction is grasped the setting for natural selec tion is obvious, particularly with the concept of the gene pool of modern genetics. Then follow two papers on physical anthropology by T. D. Stewart and J. S. Weiner, the latter reprinted from the American Scientist, 1957. Weiner's chapter is the more important in that it separates the interests of physical anthropologists into human evolution and human population biology. It is the latter division which is beginning to make the biological study of human evolution intelligible in modern terms. The fourth chapter is important in introducing the evolution of mind, Behavioral Evolution and the Emergence of the Self, by A. Irving Hallo well. Although Darwin was accused of gross anthropomorphism in his Ex pression of the Emotions, nevertheless within twenty years a new phylo genetic dimension was added to scientific psychology. With the recogni tion of a social element in primate behavior, and its culmination in man of self-objectivation, there appears a psychological basis for cul ture. This excellent chapter is followed with a shorter discussion by Joseph H. Greenberg, entitled Language and Evolution, which introduces the development of symbolism. Language is based on symbolic behavior, and this has ramified into a complex system which gives language the status of an evolutionary emergent. The discovery that languages are grouped in families, and that they have spread, changed, and recombined was a major evolutionary observation which long antedated Darwin. The remaining chapters deal with the two major divisions of human culture study, archeology or the study of extinct cultures, and cultural anthropology which deals mainly with living peoples. Robert J. Braid wood reviews Archeology and the Evolutionary Theory, and William G. Haag discusses The Status of Evolutionary Theory in American History. The latter title actually covers a consideration of progress in archeology, and adds the suggestion from biology that the evolutionary view requires consideration of the adaptation of cultures to the environment. The three final chapters are concerned with cultural anthropology, and they reveal the basis for the unjustifiably bitter controversies over evolutionary interpretations which have made suspect the scientific stature of some cultural anthropologists for many years. It has appeared to some biologists at least that cultural anthropologists were so anxious to disclaim the influence of nineteenth century biology in their interpre</page><page sequence="3">PERSPECTIVES 93 tations that they were throwing out the most useful generalization avail - able. These final chapters are: Leslie A. White, The Concept of Evolution in Cultural Anthropology; George Peter Murdock, Evolution in Social Organization; and the summary lecture by Clyde Kluckhohn, The Role of Evolutionary Thought in Anthropology. Leslie White's chapter is, as always, controversial, but it contains much helpful history of the argu ments. Professor Murdock's section appears to this reviewer to be the most carefully developed and convincing chapter in the whole book. After discussing the anastamosing tree of culture relationships in contrast with the branching tree of biological evolution, he cites two distinctive examples of cultural elements. The first is smoking tobacco which is an individual satisfaction and is socially structured only rarely. It is readily borrowed and diffuses widely from one culture to another over widely separated areas. An opposite element is language which behaves more like a genetic trait in biological evolution. Just as genes from the common pool of the species may reappear in new combinations, so do the elements of a particular language reappear in numerous dialects. These are sub ject to only slight diffusion over long periods, and the language data can often be used to mark migrations of the people themselves. The carefully analyzed Yale "Cross Cultural Survey" has given addi tional information on the modes of cultural change. It suggests that cultural elements tend to fit into a certain small number of coherent stable systems or patterns. These show clear evidence of constant diffu sion, and little or no correlation with biological origins of the people. The concepts which emerge are very similar to those emphasized by Mayr for biological evolution, but the elements and the rules of inter change are quite different. Professor Kluckhohn's concluding lecture, though showing evidence of haste in composition, is a fair-minded and thoughtful summary not only of this volume but of the history of anthropology in recent years. He points out that the opposition to the use of the evolution concept in cultural anthropology was due chiefly to the notion that it implied unilinear progress, a popular generalization which has no basis in the Origin of Species. Kluckhohn quite properly refers to his own suggestive studies of linguistic change, and points out "the four basic categories used by students of population genetics (isolation, mutation, gene flow, selective advantage cited by Mayr) have their useful analogies in lin guistic change . . . Both sets of data reveal similarities due to conver gence, as well as to genetic descent." This book is recommended for scientists as well as for other student? of the history of ideas. It is an excellent marking milestone which should be in every library.</page></plain_text>
