<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Dante Bibliography for 1980 ANTHONY L. PELLEGRINI bibliography is intended to include the Dante transla- tions published in this country in 1980 and all Dante studies and reviews published in 1980 that are in any sense Ameri- can. The latter criterion is construed to include foreign reviews of American publications pertaining to Dante. The listing of reviews in general is selective, particularly in the case of studies bearing only peripherally on Dante. As a rule, items cited from Dissertation Abstracts Internationalist registered without further abstracting, since the titles tend to be self- explanatory. Items not recorded in the bibliographies for previous years are entered as addenda to the present list. NOTE. Generally, the citation of an individual study from a collected volume representing several authors is given in brief, while the main entry of the volume is listed with full bibliographical data in its alphabetical order. Issues of this journal under the former title of Annual Report of the Dante Society continue to be cited in the short form of Report, with volume number.

Cambon, Glauco. "The Purgatorial Smile: A Footnote on Dante's Humor." In Yearbook of Italian Studies, IV, 105-115. 175</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, XOX, 1981 Contends that Dante's Purgatory is the true locus of humor in the Corn- media. In contrast to the negative excess of the Inferno and the mystical excess of the Paradiso, the Purgatorio is punctuated with smiles of humanizing humor along the process of self- liberation in a kind of comedy of manners and secular ritual with civilizing effect that relates Dante to playwrights of Renaissance and modern Europe. In illustrations are cited especially the episodes of Statius and Virgil (Purg. xxi), Pope Adrian (xdc), Forese Donati (xxni), and Dante-Pilgrim himself (xxvil) along the purgatorial way of liberation suffused with gentle humor. Casagiande, Gino, and Christopher Kleinhenz. "Inferno VII: Cariddi e l'avarizia." In Aevum, Liv, 340-344. Contend that the association of Chary bdis figuratively with avarice (an established topos in the exegetical tradition) as used by the twelfth-century Alain de Lille in a homily on the Trinity could have influenced the reference to Charybdis in Inferno vn, 2.1-24. That passage of Alain's, along with another in his Deplanctu naturae suggestive of much of the conceptual struc- ture of Dante's canto, would reinforce recent critical findings on the intellec- tual affinity between the two writers. Chiarenza, Marguerite Mills. "Falsity and Fiction in the Allegory of Poets.'" In Quaderni d'italianistica, I, No. 1 (Autumn), 80-86. Seeks to clarify Dante's distinction (Conv. n, i) between the "allegory of poets" and the "allegory of theologians," contending that by the first he understood mythological poetry (as evidenced by his example taken from Ovid) and would have considered his own work distinct from, although related to, both types of allegory. The author examines the "allegory of poets" theoretically and historically and concludes that, where tradition had, in- congruously, allowed a poet's work to be seen simultaneously as false on the literal level and true allegorically, Dante more coherently "conceived of a representation which, though false to the letter of reality, was true to its spirit; and to be true to the spirit of reality meant to be implicitly meaningful" (allegorically). Dante therefore resolved medieval tendencies toward allegorization and Christianization of myth by his commitment to a unique and functional role for poetry which demanded a truthful reading for the let- ter (example: the Apollo-Marsyas myth in the invocation of Par. I). For us, ambiguities arise when we construe the allegory of poets according to modern notions of fiction. The innovative allegory of Dante's Comedy is attributable to the ambivalence of his being a Christian poet in a pagan tradition and to his need to insure that the truth he read into pagan poetry was written into his. Cook, Albert. "Image as a Norm: Some Problems." In Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, xxxvm (Spring), 249-2.54. 176</page><page sequence="5">American Dante Bibliography for 1980, ANTHONY L. PELLEGRINI Briefly examines the nature and use of image and metaphor in Pindar, Plato, Dante, and Rimbaud and concludes there is no one normative function under which their practice can be subsumed, for the symbols themselves de- pend on the entire conception of the complex individual communicative act in the respective works. Cook, William R. (Joint author). "Simon the Magician and the Medieval Tradition." See Herzman, Ronald B. . . . Creasy, William C. "The Shifting Landscape of Hell." In Comitatus, XI, 40-65. Traces the dramatically changing concept of hell in theology, literature, and the visual arts as of a primarily physical nature (poena sensu) to one predominantly psychological and spiritual between the fourteenth and seven- teenth centuries. The author bases his survey on such works as Dante's Corn- media with its strong influence on early depictions in the visual arts in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance by Nardo di Cione, Giovanni Pisano, and Francesco Traini- all of which depictions of infernal punishments had ample sources in Scripture and writings of saints like Augustine. The landscape of hell and the nature of damnation begins to shift to a realm of chiefly spiritual isolation, or poena damni, during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth cen- turies, as evidenced by the works of Hieronymus Bosch and Jean Mandyn and more strongly by works of John Calvin and also by Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus. With this change in emphasis also comes an increased stress by theologians on the poena damni in their sermons, among Catholics as well as Protestants. In the seventeenth century, with increasing stress on Divine Love as the essence of God, rather than the old principle of Divine Justice, much more debate ensued over the nature of hell, since defining the nature of damnation had implications about the nature of God Himself. Dale, Corinne. "Lancelot and the Medieval Quests of Sir Lancelot and Dante." In Walker Percy: Art and Ethics, edited by Jac Tharpe (Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi), pp. 99-106. Examines parallels with Mallory's Sir Lancelot and Dante's Beatrice (esp. in the Purg.) in Walker Percy's novel, Lancelot (1977), in which the ambiguous ending is seen to suggest a message of the transforming power of human love. D'Andrea, Antonio. "La struttura della Vita Nuova: le divisioni delle rime." In Yearbook of Italian Studies, IV, 13-40. Examines the "divisioni" of the Vita Nuova in relation to the scholastic tradition and to some specific possible models (Boethius' De consolatione philosophiae, Brunetto Latini's Rettorica, Albertus Magnus' commentary to the Sententiae of Peter Lombard. . . ) and concludes that the model is to be found in the Scholastic commentaries of the thirteenth century. Thus the divisioni evince that Dante had acquired another aspect of medieval culture, ^77</page><page sequence="6">Dante Studies, XCIX, 1981 the Scholastic, doctrinal, philosophical, which is in some degree incorporated in the libello. The pattern of the divisioni, their variation, the manner of the incipit of each, the introduction of related questions, all point to an impor- tant role the divisioni actually play in enhancing the structure and meaning of the Vita Nuova, for example, by expressing the tension set up from various standpoints in the work, between the initial enigma presented at the begin- ning of the first sonnet and the enigma at the end of the work which looks toward a mysterious future. Dasenbrock, Reed Way. "Dante's Hell and Pound's Paradiso: 'tutto spezzato.'" In Paideuma, DC, No. 3, 501-504. Finds a Dantean echo in Pound's use of spezzato (Inf. XXI, 108, recall- ing the "ruina" caused by Christ's harrowing of Hell) in Canto 74, which canto, in keeping with Pound's own reference to the Cantos as "by no means an orderly Dantescan rising," the author contends does not initiate the "Paradiso" section of the work, as many claim, but should, because of its structure, be construed in a more complex relation to the whole Commedia. In short, the Cantos reveal a pattern of transformation not modeled on Dante. Davis, Charles T. "Poverty and Eschatology in the Commedia." In Yearbook of Italian Studies, IV, 59-86. Examines, illustrating from the Commedia and Christian tradition, Dante's vague prophecies of earthly reformation in an eschatological vision of eventual political peace and renewal together with the eradication of cupidity and restoration of clerical poverty as prerequisite to ecclesiastical reform. In this vi- sion based on Augustinian and Thomistic ideals of charity and justice, Dante's models are Saint Francis the mendicant and Henry VH the Roman Emperor. The study addresses a number of specific aspects of Dante's poem, such as the exemplary condemnation of a pope like Nicholas III, among others, the image of the Church as meretrix, the Veltro/DXV prophecies, the rationale of dual rule of the world in the hands of Emperor and Pope in their distinctive spheres. While indebted to the Franciscan Spirituals, Dante dif- fered from their ideal of a new age in the future by his more radically backward-looking vision of renovatio betokening an ideal of a totally power- ful emperor and a totally poor clergy that he associated with the past. De Bonfils Templer, Margherita. "'Quando Amor mi spira, noto. . .' (Purg. xxiv)." In Dante Studies, xcvm, 79-98. Contends that Dante's statement of his poetics in the Bonagiunta episode (Purg. xxiv) has been variously construed by critics now in the sense of sincerity or spontaneity, now in a theological sense, but neglecting to pay pro- per attention to the poet's citing of his earlier canzone, Donne ch'avete in- telletto d'amore, as his reference point, which for Bonagiunta is emblematic 178</page><page sequence="7">American Dante Bibliography for 1980, ANTHONY L. PELLEGRINI of a new poetic style that, significantly, the latter only now that he is in Purgatory can appreciate. One key to understanding the passage lies in the contrast between the use of "femmina" by Bonagiunta (thus marking himself as of the "old" earthbound school, in referring to the woman of Lucca) and the use of "donne" in Dante's earlier poem cited to characterize the new, lof- tier style. Another key point made by the author relates to the verb "notare" used by Dante to define his poetics, a verb that should be construed (accor- ding to its use by Dante elsewhere) in the sense of seconding or matching in harmony, in a spiritual sense, and applied in this context to the close relation between love and poetic expression. It is in this sense and in the purgatorial setting that reference to the first canzone of the Vita Nuova must be understood, while the purgatorial setting itself illuminates that past poetic in- stance cited. It is obvious that the loftier love Dante recognizes as source of his inspiration in the Bonagiunta episode has its roots in the love of the Vita Nuova. The author also touches on the use of "penne" which she insists it would be too pedestrian to construe as "writing pens," but must be taken as "wings" (as some critics have), citing Socrates' speaking of the hardening of the wings in the Phaedo, a metaphor that entered the linguistic terminology of later mystics familiar to Dante. Dickson, Kay. "Toward Order and Transcendence: Dante's Use of Synaesthesia in the Divine Comedy." In Romance Notes, XXI, No. 1 (Fall), 111-116. Discusses some major instances of synaesthesia in the three cantiche of the Divine Comedy as they move to a climax of sensory fusion, relating them to one another in their reflection of the progression from disorder to consonance with the divine order and final transcendence. Dante's use of synaesthesia is therefore seen as not just poetically decorative, but as vitally serving the thematic structure of the poem. DiOrio, Dorothy M. "Concetto e condanna di Dante sull'usura." In Rivista di cultura classica e medioevale, xxi-xxii (Jan. 1979-Dec. 1980), 135-141. Text in English, identical with her article, "Dante's Condemnation of Usury," in Re: Artes Liberates, V, No. 1 (1978), 17-15 (see below, under Ad- denda). Di Scipio, Giuseppe C. "Dante and St. Paul: The Blinding Light and Water." In Dante Studies, XCVIH, 151-157. Contends that the elements of blinding light from heaven, cleansing water, and the time of midday common to Paul's mystical experience on the way to Damascus and to Dante-Pilgrim's entry into the Empyrean {Par. XXX), along with supporting references elsewhere (in Inf. n, Par. I, Purg. I, and Par. XXVI), serve to confirm the comparison of Dante's journey to the vision of God with that of Paul's similar experience. 179</page><page sequence="8">Dante Studies, xcrx, 1981 Emmerson, Richard Kenneth, and Ronald B. Herzman. "Antichrist, Simon Magus, and Dante's Inferno XIX." In Traditio, XXXVI, 373-398. Luca Signorelli's Dantesque fresco, "Fatti deU'Anticristo" (commissioned in 1500 for Orvieto Cathedral), though chronologically much later than Dante, is used for re-inforcing an interpretation of Inferno XIX because of the com- mon sources they share in traditional Christian iconology and symbolism, and more specifically because of the insights the fresco provides into Dante's description of the church in his own day. The authors analyze and interpret the fresco on the basis of the many source elements from the common tradi- tion, stressing, for example, the linking of Simon Magus with the Antichrist and Apocalypticism, and also the association of the fall of Simon Magus with the upside-down crucifixion of Peter. Inferno XIX, in turn, is throughout seen to reflect all these elements of Simon, Antichrist, upside-down crucifixion of Peter, and apocalypticism in multiform ways. Dante's treatment of the canto in this manner manifests his intent of emphasizing the corrupt condition of the Church and Papacy at the time, thus combining the historical moment and universal history and suggesting the fourfold interpretation (here, the anagogical heightens the impact of the allegorical). Evans, Annette. "Allusion as Structure: Vittorini and Dante." In Symposium xxxiv (Spring), 13-18. Points out many parallels between Vittorini's Conversazione in Sicilia and the Divina Commedia through a whole pattern of consistent, subtle allusion to Dante's poem, such as to achieve a level of pertinence that serves to unify the novel. Vittorini alludes to the narrative structure of Dante's poem in moral terms "in an attempt to recapture and to refute an entire moral system" that no longer holds for his modern protagonist. Ferrucci, Franco. The Poetics of Disguise: The Autobiography of the Work in Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare. Translated by Ann Dunnigan. Ithaca, New York; London: Cornell University Press. 178 p. 11.5 cm. Contends, as his general thesis, that when creative writers such as these ar- rived at a critical impasse in their attempts to recapture and represent reality, they bent their art to disguising it, and it is a function of the interpreting critic to analyze the motive and structure of the device of disguise. Although the crisis of that artistic moment is masked, the key to the crisis made up of signs and symptoms interwoven into the texture of the work and thereby enriching its meaning, constitutes what the author calls the autobiography of the work.

Literary Models and the Autobiography of the Work; Bibliography; Index. Two essays of specific Dan- tean interest are chapter 3 (pp. 66-102.), which deals with Dante's dissimulating use of the term "comedy" as the poem's title, a term explicitly 180</page><page sequence="9">American Dante Bibliography for 1980, ANTHONY L. PELLEGRINI used only twice (in the Inferno) in the whole work- to disguise expressively the really serious, even "tragic," quality of the Commedia, to come to terms with the poetic disguise necessary for this creative effort, and to justify his use of the metaphoric lie for recounting the experience of his fantastic journey, bound as the writer is, unlike God and the angels, to anthropomorphic idiom as a means of communication; and chapter 4 (pp. 103-124), in which the author meditates on the ship metaphor (with the poet and the wayfarer as seafaring protagonists) and the plant metaphor, and on their significance as two recurrent and interrelated poetics informing the Commedia. Fontana, Ernest L. "William Morris's Guenevere and Dante's Francesca: Allu- sion as Revision." In English Miscellany, XXVIH-XXLX (1979-1980), 18 3-191. Contends there is a crucial relationship between Morris's poem, "Defence of Guenevere," and the Paolo-Francesca episode (Inf. V), as evidenced by Morris's subtle invocation of the Dantean passage, through use of terza rima, repeated wind imagery, and an ironic playing against Dante's absolute moral framework of the acceptance of Guenevere's ineluctable human passion as ac- commodated in Morris's naturalistic art, thus tacitly favoring, in short, the original Lancelot du lac author as poetic guide, rather than Virgil or Dante. Griffin, R. V. (Joint author). "Dante's Use of the Gorgon Medusa in Inferno LX." See Suther, Judith D. . . . Haase, Donald P. "Coleridge and Henry Boyd's Translation of Dante's Infer- no: Toward a Demonic Interpretation of 'Kubla Khan.'" In English Language Notes, xvn, 159-165. Cites historical evidence and parallels of imagery and phrasing in "Kubla Khan" and Boyd's version to show Coleridge must have read the Inferno in 1796, a year before composing his poem. Further evidence indicates Coleridge may well have intended to imbue his peculiar vision of paradise with a demonic element. Hamel, Mary. "The Dream of the King: The Alliterative Morte Arthure and Dante." In Chaucer Review \ XIV, No. 4 (Spring), 198-311. Finds evidence that the anonymous author of Morte Arthure read at least the Inferno and points out confirming parallels between the king's dream of Fortune and the drear opening scene of the dark wood (Inf. 1) and the figure of Fortuna (VII). Hawkins, Peter S. "Virtuosity and Virtue: Poetic Self-Reflection in the Com- media ." In Dante Studies, xcvm, 1-18. Contends that Dante's literary virtuosity exhibited in Inferno XXIV-XXV, regarded by many critics as a puzzling "lapse," is really intentional, as becomes clear if considered as a preparation for Canto XXVI, and finds confir- mation when this trio of cantos of the Inferno is examined in parallel with its 181</page><page sequence="10">Dante Studies, XOX, 1981 counterparts in the other cantiche. In this pattern, the author sees a poetry itself undergoing the same process of conversion as Dante-Pilgrim, "as Dante reveals in this triad of parallel cantos the death, rebirth and destiny of human language." The initial episode is marked by the temporary absence of Virgil's direct influence (he even is bidden to be silent by Dante- Pilgrim), during which the poet risks lapsing into "mere poetry" as he is carried away by his display of virtuosity. But by his exaggeration of the literary mode of Ovid he dramatizes certain impulses inherent in the act of writing poetry which are fraught with danger for the reader and especially for the writer. Significantly, Dante catches himself in his vow of Inferno XXVI, zi-24, to rein in his genius, as a preliminary to the presentation of Ulysses who reined in neither his language nor his will. If the poet is not to become a Phaeton, an Icarus, a Ulysses, then he must curb his genius; poetry must be converted, as the parallel cantos of the Purgatorio and the Paradiso illustrate. Virtue is restored to virtuosity, and this means the "reorientation of poetry from the self- enclosure entertained in Inferno XXIV-XXV," along with the "restoration of God's Word to human speech." Herzman, Ronald B. "Cannibalism and Communion in Inferno xxxni." In Dante Studies, xcvin, 53-78. Elaborates figural connections between betrayal on earth and punishment in hell, cannibalism on earth and cannibalism in hell, the Exodus and sacra- ment of the Eucharist on earth and their inversion in Dante's hell through a study of these elements as reflected in the Ugolino episode. The cannibalistic reading of Ugolino' s last act is preferred with further biblical support from Jeremiah 19: 8-9, and the implications of this reading are seen to invert the possibility for love and communion on earth, in short, to invert the heavenly banquet on earth that is the Eucharist. The author cites from a rich tradition of literary cannibalism among the ancients that may have contributed to Dante's concern with cannibalism as an inversion of the Eucharist. In connec- tion with Dante's depiction of cannibalism in this context, the author cites from ancient writers whose texts dwelling on the destruction of community, the inverted banquet, and the eating of children provided much iconographic richness on which Dante could draw, taking, as usual, elements of the classical tradition as foreshadowing Christian revelation. The seeing of cannibalism in Inferno XXXIII as an inversion of the Eucharist is best understood through the distinction between the literal eating by Ugolino of the bodies of the children and the spiritual eating of the body of Christ, a distinction supported by the scriptural, patristic, and scholastic traditions. Since the Eucharist (containing the mystery of salvation) is a re-enactment of God's love for man, its inversion is linked with betrayal, hatred, and isolation, and therefore indicates a failure to complete the ultimate journey to God, a denial of Exodus. The can- nibalism/communion inversion in the story of Ugolino and Ruggieri helps 182.</page><page sequence="11">American Dante Bibliography for 1980, ANTHONY L. PELLEGRINI contribute to the meaning of the Inferno by linking Cantos XXXHI and xxx- IV, for the parody of the Eucharist is a parody of the heavenly banquet in the vision of God as inverted by the vision of Satan in XXXIV, while the further betrayals of Judas, Brutus, and Cassius link the two canotos even more closely. Seen in this light, the ending of the Inferno parallels structurally the endings of the other two cantiche, in which, respectively, the vision of God is an- ticipated in the earthly surrogate, Beatrice (as Revelation), and then face to face. and William R.

Trace the character of Simon Magus and the tradition of sin and heresy he evoked, both in literature and in art, beginning with his first appearance in Acts of the Apostles 8: 9-24, and show how Dante in composing Inferno XLX was able to depend on reader awareness of the figure with all its associations of false magic and the inversion of spiritual ideals and the association of the sin of simony and heresy.

The original places of publication of the first six studies are duly indicated (see, respectively, Dante Studies, xcni, 131, xcv, 183-184, xcv, 165-166, xciv, 170-171, xcii, 186-187, and xciv, 169-170). In the long seventh essay (pp. 131-118) is presented a lectura Dantis of Inferno XX, a canto long considered puzzling for its many unresolved cruxes. Hollander focuses on what he perceives to be its three main themes- "the disturbing closeness of poets and poetry to divination, Dante's own poetic dependence upon classical forbears who were themselves besmirched by this sin, the difficulty of the tragic ideal in a Christian context." Several matters of detail are also addressed, e.g. , the poet's use of canzon for the cantica and the 183</page><page sequence="12">Dante Studies, XCDC, 1981 sense and classical background of certain items of language in the canto; but in separate sections particular attention is given to a "Digression: Isidore, Thomas, and the Octonary of Divination," which notes that the specific diviners named in the canto are eight (Amphiaraus, Tiresias, Aruns, Manto, Eurypylus, Michael Scotus, Guido Bonatti, Asdente) among other associa- tions with the number eight; to an exploration of "Dante's Misreading of His Authors," specifically the five classical texts reflected in this canto, which misreading is deemed to be deliberate; and to a section on the "Bilocaton of Manto," whose dual appearance in the Commedia (in Inferno XX and in Lim- bo, as referred in Purgatorio xxn) has hitherto earned Dante an indictment of self-contradiction. The latter issue is approached here from the standpoint of Boccaccio's suggestive treatment of Manto as two figures, one pious and one impious, which leads Hollander to offer the solution that the Manto of Malebolge is inspired by (pagan) Virgil's creature, while the Manto of Limbo is inspired by the filial virgin of (converted) Statius' Thebaidvj. Finally, the composition of the canto as a whole is related to the tragic quality of Virgil's poem, but with an admixture of comic style through Dante's use of the sermo humilis in the Christian context of his poetic world. Iannucci, Amilcare A. "Limbo: The Emptiness of Time." In Studi danteschi, LII (1979-80), 69-1x8. Contends that in his unique treatment of Limbo (Inf. IV) as the in- termediate of three hells, Dante departed from the traditional representation, relating it to the descensus ad inferos. He departed from the theologians by placing the virtuous pagans permanently with the unbaptized children. By contrasting the merit of the virtuous pagans and their pitiable condition in Limbo, which causes perplexity in the Pilgrim, the poet is able to exploit the situation dramatically as a Greek tragedy within the larger comedic Christian context of the Commedia. Dante is seen essentially to reserve Limbo for original sin, which the pre-Christian pagans had inherited from Adam, but unlike the Hebrews or Christians, did not receive God's grace for salvation in his inscrutable plan of predestination. With his limbo, "Dante represents the tragedy of those who lived, literally or figuratively, in that graceless period between the fall and the incarnation: in the emptiness of time." The author goes on to illustrate in detail how Dante dramatizes the tragedy of the vir- tuous pagans by revolutionizing the traditional representation of limbo as found, for example, in the lauda and the sacra rappresentazione , and shows how Dante echoes the theme of limbo elsewhere in the Commedia, especially with the pathetic /tragic figure of Virgil in the Purgatorio as a foil against the pagan Cato, the antepurgatorial souls, and Statius, all marked for salvation. Much attention is given to the motif of the harrowing of hell, with several parallels cited in the poem, such as the descent of Beatrice herself into Limbo to engage Virgil as the Pilgrim's guide, which with its Christological cor- 184</page><page sequence="13">American Dante Bibliography for 1980, ANTHONY L. PELLEGRINI respondences figures a re-enactment of the redemption. Another important focus of the author is the nobile caste Ho, seen to express the limits of humanism alone, that is, without revelation, in a manner to define the tragic limits of pagan civilization even at its most worthy. He cites further parallels and symbols, while focusing on the theme of tragedy of the virtuous pagans as sympathetically treated by Dante in the poem. Jacoff, Rachel. "The Post-Palinodic Smile: Paradiso vni and LX." In Dante Studies, XCVTH, m-12.2.. Examines the citation of the Convivio ode, Vote he 'ntendendo ilterzo ciel movete, in the context of Paradiso VIII and the following canto as a further subtle example of Dante's practice of retrospective reading and self- correction, in this instance an indirect emendation to Principalities from his earlier claim of Thrones as the angelic intelligences of the sphere of Venus. But here too, in keeping with the poet's practice of using a single verse from a previous work to evoke its whole context, several elements in the Convivio ode and its prose commentary echo the opening of Inferno I, thus suggesting that the Commedia represents a narrow escape from the Convivio and its abortive philosophical position. The poet in fact, after leaving the Convivio unfinished, succeeded in uniting the binary categories of that work through the incarna- tional poetics of the Commedia, which in Paradiso VIH recalls palinodically the poet's earlier forsaking the memory of Beatrice for Philosophy in the ode cited. The recantation of the ode in Paradiso Vffl, and with it the Convivio1 s devaluation of the Vita Nuova, implies, traditionally, a conversion. And in Paradiso LX the smiles of Cunizza and Folco looking backward over past errors (which no longer affect them now), coming immediately after the palinode of Canto Vin, help explain why Dante here does not express his usual regret over past error, for like Cunizza and Folco, he can feel equally free of guilt herer. Kay, Richard. "Two Pairs of Tricks: Ulysses and Guido in Dante's Inferno xxvi-xxvil." In Quaderni ditalianistica, I, No. 2. (Autumn), 107-124. Marshals evidence to draw a close parallelism between the cases of Ulysses and Guido da Montefeltro, and particularly to show that behind Ulysses' voyage was a ruse to reach the Isles of the Blessed (or Fortunate Isles) of an- cient Greek myth, that is, that pagan equivalent of the Earthly Paradise. This being so, then in his "orazione picciola," far from engaging in an innocent harangue to persuade his men to a noble enterprise, Ulysses was actually manipulating his crew. Thus, Ulysses committed a sin that in common with Guido's would be called astuteness or cunning, which Dante had condemned in the Convivio (IV, xxvii, 5) as especially unseemly in old age, when wisdom cannot be divorced from goodness. Kleinhenz, Christopher. "Plutus, Fortune, and Michael: The Eternal Triangle." In Dante Studies, xcvni, 35-52.. 185</page><page sequence="14">Dante Studies, XCIX, 1981 Notes in Inferno VI Virgil's description of the apocalyptic events of Judg- ment Day and the contrasting images of physical and spiritual imperfection and the vera perfezion of the True City developed in the canto, along with the mention of Michael at the beginning of Canto VII to thwart the infernal guar- dian Plutus, all as preparation for the Pilgrim's descent to the fourth circle where avarice and prodigality are punished. Also noticed are the structural links unifying Cantos VI, vn, and vm by transitional connectors and internal parallels and similarities, as well as the mutual presence and conception here of Fortune and Plutus because of their close association in the literary and iconographical tradition- Plutus as the god of wealth or excessive concern with worldly goods and Fortune as earthly arbiter over their transmission in the world. The perfectly spinning wheel of Fortune (presented as an angelic intelligence ordained by God) both suggests the perfect circlings of the heavenly spheres and contrasts with the imperfect, ceaseless, and futile half- circlings of the sinners punished in the fourth circle. The reference to Michael (representing Christ) recalls the rebellious angels and their fate, thus confirm- ing also the association of Plutus with Lucifer. But Michael is also associated with the end of time when he will combat the Antichrist and, as Christ's sur- rogate, see to the distribution of heavenly rewards at the Last Judgment. Thus, a number of patterns result: the association of Cerberus, Lucifer, and Plutus on the one hand, and on the other, Michael, DXV, and Christ; and also a series of opposing pairs- Veltio-lupa, Michael- Antichrist, Michael (DXV, Christ)-Lucifer (and rebellious angels), Michael-Plutus, and Fortune- Plutus. Canto VII, then, points to a triangular relationship among Plutus, Fortune, and Michael in an upward moving hierarchy from Hell to Earth to Heaven. The antithetical relationship among the various figures has its universal counterpart in the struggle between the forces of good and evil. In sum, the specific and the general, the temporal and the eternal, come together in Infer- no vn through the figures of Plutus, Michael, and Fortune in a way suggesting the larger design of Dante's poem.

Contends that William Kirby's novel, The Golden Dog (Le Chien d'Or): A Romance of Old Quebec (1877), reveals a structural and thematic use of Dante's Divine Comedy in its explicit and implicit Dantean references and patterns of imagery, such as to constitute a key to the novel's moral vision.

PELLEGRINI Aquinas' theology, as some critics hold, though the poem coincides with it at the aesthetic level. More accurately and importantly, where the theologian, as theologian, represents "faith seeking understanding"; Dante's poetic journey, seen as "faith seeking experience" (fides quaerens experientiam), is a superior form because it involves inner faith seeking completion through exterior faith, implying the transformation of all earthly experience in the light of faith and thus belonging to the area of ethical and mystical life as well. The latter point is critical, as evidenced by the stress on the ethical side laid in the Letter to Can Grande and the placing of Saint Thomas at a less exalted level in the Paradiso than, say, the mystic Saint Bernard. Presented as a special kind of autobiography interwoven with the truths of divine revelation and recording in poetic expression the fullest experience of the world, Dante's journey is an experience sensory in nature and therefore the basis of perfect knowledge capable of effecting inner change in the person undergoing it. This poetic journey, however, represents a progressive ordering of the Pilgrim's ex- periences teleologically towards ultimate union with God. Litz, A. Walton.

The blood potion, vestige of a primitive, even archetypal practice of blood brotherhood, eventually passed as metaphor into Provencal and Old French lyric, from which Dante could draw his own use of the metaphorical ritual to express spiritual union of lover and beloved. Picchio Simonelli, Maria. "Pubblico e societa nel Convivio." In Yearbook of Italian Studies, IV, 41-58. Seeks to determine what specific contemporary readers Dante had in mind, a difficult problem which, unresolved, can otherwise lead to misinterpreta- tions. A close examination of the Convivio reveals use of the technique of disputatio, sign in itself that Dante had a well-defined public in mind, and also textual indications of polemic against detractors of the truth. From a moral standpoint, it is evident that Dante was addressing average persons on the ethical scale, those not exactly evil, yet not entirely good either, a group, furthermore, who had not studied Latin, the means of acquiring learning. Dante condemns the educators, the litterati, and specifically, the litterati 188</page><page sequence="17">American Dante Bibliography for 1980, ANTHONY L. PELLEGRINI italici, whom he finds largely lacking in moral goodness, and even more specifically, the clerics. It is clear from the Convivio and the Commedia as well that Dante had a politically reactionary tripartite conception of society: ora tores or freemen, bellatores or governors, and laboratores or laborers, with each order fulfilling its particular function for the common good. Among these groups, of which the laboratores had become arrogant and presump- tuous in their ignorance and the learned oratores had become corrupt, Dante seems to have placed his hope for achieving his mission in the bellatores for intellectually edifying and spiritually guiding the citizenry by use of the light- giving vernacular to overcome their blindness. Pirrotta, Nino. "I poeti della scuola siciliana e la musica." In Yearbook of Italian Studies, IV, 5-12.. Contends that contrary to common prejudice against the union of poetry and music the practice was encouraged by Emperor Frederick II to maintain lustre at his court, and its possibility as an alternative endured long after- wards, as reflected in Dante's Casella episode (Purg. n) and the De vulgari eloquentia n, 4, before the eventual separation of the two elements. In any case, in such a union the music played a subordinate role as embellishing ac- companiment and took its repetitive form from the stanzaic structure of the poems. Poole, Gordon. "Dante's canzone. Tre donne intorno al cor!' In Dante Studies, XCVIII, 1x3-144. While there is general agreement that his puzzling doctrinal canzone, Tre donne intorno alcor mi son venute {Rime, Civ) addresses a crisis in Christen- dom and in the exiled Dante in a context of decaying justice, there is much disagreement on the identification of the "tre donne." To resolve this pro- blem, and starting with the other figures in the poem, the author argues for associating Amore with charity (root of all virtue, caritas) and Amore's aunt, Drittura, with justice (as some have done), but differentiated here in the aspect of natural law (ius naturale). The mother and daughter figures, derived from the latter, are begotten, according to the poem, parthenogenetically from the Godhead and the Holy Ghost and divine law (in the mind of the Godhead), the father and mother of charity (Amore). The daughter and granddaughter figures, in turn, clearly pertaining to human law (lex humana), can be supposed to represent, respectively, ius gentium and ius civile, pertaining to regional law and to specific legal organization of single townships. Written early (between 1302. and 1305?) in the poet's exile, the canzone is seen to manifest a rationalistic optimism largely in accord with a Thomistic position on these matters, before later passing on to an Augustin- ian stage, attributing the origin of these varoius aspects of law, including ius gentium and ius civile as well as ius naturale, to Eden. The author concludes by charting a complete family tree organically correlating the various figures 189</page><page sequence="18">Dante Studies, XCIX, 1981 in the canzone under the following identifications: first comes Lex Aeterna, from which branch out, on the one hand, Ius Divinum, which together with the Spiritus Sanctus, begets Caritas, and on the other, Ius Naturale, from which derive, in turn, Ius Gentium and Ius Civile. This scheme fits Dante's view of the human world organized hierarchically with eternal law manifested in the institutions of Church headed by the Pope and State ruled by the Emperor, the first being entrusted with divine law accepted on faith and the second transmitting eternal law in the form of natural law to be accepted through reason and from which the various aspects of human law derive. Charity and Justice, of course, together constitute the fount of all human vir- tues, the way to man's earthly and heavenly beatitudes. Popolizio, Stephen. "Literary Reminiscences and the Act of Reading in Infer- no. V." In Dante Studies, XCVIII, 19-33. Examines why Dante makes the reading of books such a major theme in In- ferno V, which deals with sinners dominated by emotions, and finds (1) that Francesca and Paolo's sin was vitally connected with their improper reading of the Lancelot romance, that is, without discretio, and thus emotionally for pleasure rather than analytically with didactic purpose; (2.) that the many literary reminiscences, both secular and religious, built into the canto by the poet, especially in Francesca's account, serve to re-inforce the first point that Francesca seeks in literature only what is consoling and exalting, an emotional experience, not a learning process, with the result even of some distortion of fact; and (3) that Dante clearly equates faulty reading of a text with a poten- tial state of sin, as can be seen in the Pilgrim himself at this stage of the journey- he too, not yet capable of reacting analytically and rationally, is emotionally overcome with empathy and falls senseless to the ground, sym- bolically reenacting the consequences of Paolo and Francesca's sin.

PELLEGRINI sion towards spiritualization of love, consummated in the Divine Comedy, in the second, despite changing external circumstances, and the poet- lover's higher aspirations, love, unfulfilled and ever short of ultimate happiness, re- mains as a fundamental passion peculiar to the human condition, and be- queathed by Petrarch to posterity as an enduring mythology and inexhausti- ble source of poetic inspiration. Reynolds, Mary T. "Dante in Joyce's Exiles." In James Joyce Quarterly, xvni, No. 1 (Fall), 35-44. Points out Dantean echoes and parallels- and inversions- in James Joyce's play, Exiles (1913-1915), with the Vita Nuova elements in Purgatorio xxx-xxxi, some of which already appear as early as chapter n (written in 1905) of Stephen Hero and also in an intermediate work, Giacomo Joyce. Exiles is evidence of Joyce's maturing syncretism and his firm reading of the Divine Comedy, patterns of which he however transformed in his own fiction, thus marking his distance as a modern artist from Dante. For example, against Dante's plumbing of the soul theologically, Joyce followed a psycho-analytic approach; also, symptomatic of the modern break with the Catholic past, he attributes a negative image to the Beatrice in Exiles. But it is in this play that he initiates Dante as a Catholic presence in Irish artistic life. Sayers, Dorothy L. Further Papers on Dante. Westport, Connecticut: Green- wood Press.

"Dante's Image of Hope in Paradiso." In Renascence, XXXIII (Autumn), 24-35. Examines the final vision of the Divinity encompassing also the image of man {Par. XXXIII, 117-131) as an image of hope, which has its beginning in the opening image of Inferno I and elaboration in the whole poetic journey itself, patterned on Christ's death to this world, descent into and ascent in the After Life, and resurrection into Paradise, as commemorated at Easter. The poem is seen structurally to maintain a tension between kronos, or history in this life, and kairos, or sacred time, between revelation and salvation, with the concrete-universal image of hope as the sustaining element, offering Dante and his reader a possibility to be sought in this world. Through the final vision/ image of hope, the poet is actually pointing to our life on earth, as is supported also by other allusions to birth /rebirth patterned on the christological example with references to Mary in the same final canto. Smarr, Janet Levarie. "Celestial Patterns and Symmetries in the Vita Nuova." In Dante Studies, XCVIII, 145-150. Citing an article by Robert Hollander noting in the Vita Nuova nine visions of Beatrice plus one in the Empyrean and an article by Robert Durling on Dante's use of cosmological structures as early as the rime petrose, the author submits a perceived pattern of the ten celestial spheres correlated with Dante's visions of Beatrice in the libello. In addition to a celestial correlation with the Beatrician appearances as a progression or ascending pattern toward God, there seems to be a coordinated pairing of the visions from the first and ninth toward the central, crucial event of Beatrice's withholding her greeting. It is evident that Dante sought very early to inform his poetry with a cosmological model and symmetrical construction, which he fully achieved in the Corn- media. Smith, Nathaniel B. "Arnant Daniel in the Purgatorio: Dante's Ambivalence toward Provencal." In Dante Studies, xcvni, 99-109. Notes Dante's linguistic patriotism for Italian and analyzes the Provencal verses that Arnaut is made to speak in Purgatorio XXVI, 140-147, which under many aspects are quite common to the Provencal poets in general. Literarily, then, Dante has made Arnaut a universal archetype of the troubadours, reflecting their form, style, and vocabulary, as well as their thematic obsession with love. Such a figure of Arnaut, represented as linguistically and poetically universal, accords with Dante's conception of a universal world culture with a common tradition enabling Greeks, Latins, and thirteenth-century men to converse in intellectual partnership. This universality given to Arnaut here is seen to betray Dante's ambivalence towards troubadour poetry, which he ob- 191</page><page sequence="21">American Dante Bibliography for 1980, ANTHONY L.

Contains a chapter on "Historical Autobiography" (pp. 34-61), which in- cludes a discussion of Dante's Vita Nuova and extended comparisons with St. Augustine's Confessions, John Bunyan's Grace Abounding, and Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, with respect to the evolution of the genre.

Percorsi di significato (Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Facolta di Magistero-Istituto Ispanico; Messina-Firenze: D'Anna, 1977), the author elaborates on many parallels with Dante in Borges' ElAleph, Beatriz, and El Sur, in particular with the Paradiso, the Vita Nuova, and the Purgatorio, respectively.

Snow (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press), pp. 118-140. Explores Dante's Vita Nuova and Petrarch's Canzoniere in their intertex- tual relation to the courtly lyric tradition and focuses more specifically on the "protogeneric" narrative pattern of the poet-lover in that tradition. While there are similarities in the two works, especially in their development of a story line with the help of the prose in the one and the significant distribution and ordering of poems in the other, the conclusion differs in each case: Petrarch, whose work is indebted to Dante's more than he admits, does not transform Laura into a Beatrice, but turns ultimately to the Virgin herself. Suther, Judith D., and R. V. Giffin. "Dante's Use of the Gorgon Medusa in Inferno LX." In Kentucky Romance Quarterly, xxvn, 69 - 84. Review briefly the Medusa figure in classical literature and in the monster lore of the Middle Ages to account for Dante's use of the figure. From the am- biguous oxymoronic figure of a Grim Queen combining monstrosity and beauty, the authors submit that in its antithetical yet prepotent character the Gorgon Medusa (who is never actually seen) in Inferno IX serves as the struc- tural counterpart or annunciatory opposite of Beatrice's appearance in Purgatorio XXX. Supporting this view are the many numerological associa- 193</page><page sequence="22">Dante Studies, xcix, 1981 tions of 3 and 9 in the Commedia and the Vita Nuova surrounding the two figures, along with elements of the rime petrose.

"Shakespeare's Macbeth and Dante's Inferno: A Com- parison of the Images of Hell, Damnation and Corruption." In Iowa State Journal of Research, LTV, 461-468. Cites five parallels between Macbeth and the Inferno, particularly Macbeth's advance perception of the treacherous murder of Duncan, with its fourfold sinful aspect that exactly parallels Dante's fourfold division of treachery in Cocytus. Such cogent evidence in this play, along with Dantean echoes in Measure for Measure and Richard m, prompts ever more poignantly the question of whether and to what exent Shakespeare knew and was in- fluenced by Dante. Valentine, Robert Y. "Arturo Cova: Spirit and Savage Plant." In Revista de Estudios Hispanicos, XIV, No. 2. (May), 39-46. Elaborates on the parallels and echoes of Inferno XIII, with its bleeding, talking trees of the suicides, in the characterization of Arturo Cova in Jose Eustasio Rivera's novel of self-destruction, La voragine (1924)- Valesio, Paolo. llRegretter: Genealogia della ripetizione nell'episodio di Paolo e Francesca." In Yearbook of Italian Studies, IV, 87-104. Seeks to clarify further the Paolo and Francesca episode in Inferno V by ex- amining the intertextual genealogy of significant forms constituting the larger literary context of Dante's treatment even in its discontinuity, more specifically in verses 112.-117, where Dante seeks to know the "prima radice" of the ill- fated love affair. Especially significant is the element of repetitivity of the language of love in the literary tradition on which Dante-poet builds. Impor- tant in this genealogy is the merging of the Lancelot- Guinevere with the Tristan-Iseut stories. The author lends much more importance than hitherto has obtained to the reading of the Lancelot- Guinevere story in the light of the Tristan-Iseut tale, but in the latter's combination of the Bern text of the "Folies de Tristan" and the Oxford text probably derived from it. A key ele- ment is the term, regretter, with its implication of nostalgic remembrance, for intertextually coloring the Dantean episode in Inferno V, specifically in Francesca' s dual narrative of her story. Valtz, Denise. "A Reappraisal of Giovanni Gentile's Criticism of Dante." In Forum Italicum, xrv, 195-109. Reviews Giovanni Gentile's critical position on Dante to prove that he deserves more important consideration as a twentieth-century critic than he has been accorded (probably for political reasons), pointing out that even Erich Auerbach seems indebted to him. In particular, the author contends 194</page><page sequence="23">American Dante Bibliography for 1980, ANTHONY L. PELLEGRINI that Gentile, far from separating the poetic and philosophical aspects of Dante, as some have claimed, actually considers them a unity along with the subjective element he posited in every individual under the general concept of "autocoscienza." In other words, according to Gentile's critical approach, as can be seen from his theoretical articles of 1904-1913 and his Dantean studies of 1909-19x1, Dante must be considered of a piece as a poet-philosopher striv- ing towards a fusion of knowledge and virtue in the service of social better- ment. To exemplify Gentile's illustration of Dante's "autocoscienza," the author cites his treatment of the Purgatorio, his method finding its natural conclusion in his reading of Canto VI.

What Allen Tate has called the "angelic imagination" affects, for example, Melville's dramatization of man's place in the great chain of being and his conception of images and the analogia entis, along with his version of God and creation. The bulk of the essay is devoted to the elaboration of Melville's dramatization of Ahab's "angelic imagination," to the literal voyage of the Pequodus. embodying the soul on an itinerarium mentis, and to a long disquisition on developments in theology since the Middle Ages that have tended toward a metaphysics of thought without faith or physical object and hence an alienation of man from God, a situation reflected in Ahab's dwelling in a sphere of pure thought and J95</page><page sequence="24">Dante Studies, xcix, 198 1 in his monomaniacal quest for the infinite power, which severs his mind from his body. As with Dante's Ulysses, Ahab lacks a guide to avoid destruction on such a journey of spiritual exploration, a guide such as Dante-Pilgrim had; by contrast with Ahab, Ishmael, it is pointed out, has guidance thanks to the presence of Queequeg as a "principle of limitation." And so "limitation, humility, and reciprocity rather than the angelic imagination and the will to ... power, and a waiting attentiveness to mediating and sacramental im- ages of revelation rather than the seizing of truth from a wholly transcendent divinity, mark the concluding tone of the narrative" in Moby Dick.

Yeats had in Dante, whom he saw as the first romantic, while considering himself as the last- the stages (the 1890's and the years 1915-19x5) of this literary relation, his reading of Dante in various nineteenth-century translations, his primary fascination with the role of Dante as the visionary poet in exile, his critical portrait of Dante as the self-image he wished to become. Although Yeats expressed his interest in Dante chiefly in his critical prose, he also adapted Dante's work in several of his creative works, of which the author singles out for special comment two poems ("The Second Coming" and "Byzantium") to show Yeats's difference from Dante and one ("Cuchulain Comforted") as a sustained effort at a modern Dantesque composition. All Yeats's poems show his distance from Dante; where Christianity is a unified system of truth for Dante, it is a source of metaphors for Yeats. Caliendo, Philip Martin. "Dante and the Dance of Heaven." In La Fusta, III, No. 2 (Fall), 9-15.

PELLEGRINI psychology and religious ritual, indeed as the supreme manifestation of physical life and the ultimate symbol of spiritual life. The author cites a significant Scriptural reference to dancing (Matt. 11: 17) and three probable medieval sources for the poet's expressive use of the dance- the booklet, Dieta Salutis (of uncertain authorship), the School of St. Victor, and St. Thomas Aquinas on the nature of Act.

On the possibility that the poem may even be "trying to say something that could not be said then but was soon to be said and that we, from our perspective, can help it to say" in other words, to help it point forwards to the future rather than back to established Christian doctrine, the author suggests we direct "hard" questions to Dante's poem from our contemporary humanitarian, godless point of view, in order to see if it can give answers relevant to us.

In Re: Artes Liberates, V, No. 1 (1978), 17-15. Outlines briefly the concept of usury as it evolved through biblical, patristic, ecclesiastical, and Scholastic teachings and is reflected in Dante's poem (Inf. XI, 94-111), which appeared at a time when ecclesiastical inter- pretations and decrees regarding the gravity of usury were at their height. Dante's classification of usury with sodomy is attributable to the influence of Aristotle who considered usury unnatural, a "gain against nature," and to Scholastic theories, which through a mistranslation of the Greek led to St. Thomas Aquinas' Scholastic view of usury as contrary to natural justice. The author concludes that Dante's aristocratic status and lack of understanding of practical commerce led him to condemn Cahors and usury so harshly in Inferno XI and XVH on the basis of contemporary theoretical principles. 101</page><page sequence="30">Dante Studies, xcix, 1981 Dunlap, Barbara J.

A second section on "The 'Image' in Dante," follows a Romantic stress on Dante's ability to present figures and situations that are easily visualized, though Pound, like Foscolo, perceives Dante's art as more than painterly, indeed sculptural in effect. Pound once even considered Dante's technique as a process of "seeing" and then "reproducing exactly" his formulation of Imagism- a position that he later transcended as he went on to seek in Dante more than the "Image" as such.

PELLEGRINI Contends that beyond its biographical interest, the Nino Visconti episode should be seen as a little sacra rappresentazione through which the individual experience rises to universal significance. In the Eden- like setting reminiscent of Genesis 3, the episode liturgically recreates the central drama of salva- tion- the reversal of the Fall- reflected in Nino's personal drama in which his daughter represents Mary and his former wife, Eve, in their effect on his spiritual well-being. The symbolic significance of the two armorial emblems of the two branches of the Visconti family involved here in Nino's story and other reinforcing details, along with the general setting, all serve to reinforce this instance (among so many in the Commedid) of personal and universal history mutually reflecting each other. Jenaro-MacLennan, L. "'Remissus est modus et humilis' (Epistle to Cangrande, par. 10)." In Lettere italiane, XXXI (1979), 406-418. Answers certain criticisms of his earlier position {The Trecento Commen- tators on the "Divina Commedia" and the Epistle to Cangrande [Oxford, I974]_-See Dante Studies, xcm, 2.31) on paragraph 10 of the Letter to Cangrande and adduces sources of the passage to clarify the assertion that the language /style in the Commedia is remissus et humilis. Noting that much misunderstanding has come from confusing social status of the characters as well as language-style-tone with the distinction of genres (tragedy, comedy), the author quotes from Horace to stress the unique nature of the "present work" (the Commedid). Vehicles of transmission of Horatian notions about these matters were not only the Excerpta but also scholia of late antiquity on the classics. A reading of Ars poetica 93-96 out of context led to the error of generally reserving the humilis style to comedy. However, in point of fact, a mixture of "styles" (high, low, relaxed, calm, sharp, etc.) was admitted in whatever literary genre even in antiquity, not to mention the medieval (nth century) commentary on the Rhetorica adHerennium\ the determining factor being not the genre, but the characters concerned, their level of social status, even their momentary mood or state of mind. Thus a figure in a tragic work might on occasion speak in a low style, or a character in a comic work in a high style. Kamber, Gerald. "The Dantean Sources of Gautier's 'Affinites secretes.'" In La Fusta, ill, No. 1 (Spring 1978), 3-2.8. Traces a number of Dantean echoes, analogies, and parallels (e.g., from Inf. V and XXV) found in Theophile Gautier's opening poem to the Emaux et camees, "Affinites secretes," which reflects the stilnovistic neo-Platonism he could, with his Italianate interest, have known through Dante's Commedia.

Lobner, Corinna del Greco. "The Metaphysics of Brunetto's Basilisk in 'Scylla and Charybdis.'" In James Joyce Quarterly, XV (1978), 134-137. Contends that in borrowing the figure of the basilisk from Brunetto Latini's LiLivre dou tresor, but adapted to his own peculiar manner, in "Scylla and Charybdis," Joyce sought to evince his skill with language in token of surpass- ing his teacher, viewed here in the context of the episode in Inferno XV, thus following the example of Dante himself, whom he admired as his intellectual father. Mariani, Umberto. "L'awentura di Celestino V in Silone e in Dante." In La Fusta, 1, No. 1 (Spring 1976), 2.5-40. Contends that Ignazio Silone's treatment of Celestine V in his Vavventura diunpovero cristiano may help understand Dante's treatment of Celestine in Inferno m, 59-60, even though Silone views the figure differently from Dante. Much space is devoted to refuting a recent and representative study by Gabriele Satorelli, since, Mariani reminds us, historically a tremendous reform- ing had been building up and came to a head around the time of Dante, who in a sense interprets the general sentiment on the issue and therefore quite naturally and rightfully brands Celestine with viltade, given the disillu- sionment following the pitch of expectations of him in papal office. Critics that think otherwise lose sight of the extent of the development of the reform- ing movement. But the enigmatic phrase used by Dante to describe Celestine in the situation was perfectly clear to his contemporary readers; the poet was simply attuned to the prevailing sentiment. Masciandaro, Franco. "Appunti sulla corda di Gerione e la cintura-serpente della dialettica." In Revue des etudes italiennes, XXV (1979), 159-171. Reviews the episode of the cord and Geryon in Inferno XVI, along with that o the lonza in Inferno I, noting in particular the serpentine imagery associated with the cord as well as with the figure of Geryon and citing medieval iconography of the Liberal Arts in which Rhetoric appears as a god- dess carrying a serpent or wearing it as a belt; and concludes that the cord figures the deceptive involutions of philosophical disputations with which human reason gets snarled when it is narcissistically complacent about its own powers and so is in essence a corda-serpente, a false image of the "cord of humility" with which Virgil later girds the Pilgrim on the shore of Purgatory. 2.04</page><page sequence="33">American Dante Bibliography for 1980, ANTHONY L. PELLEGRINI Menton, Seymour, "La voragine': Circling the Triangle." In Hispania, Lix, No. 3 (Sept. 1976) 418-434. Demonstrates the importance of the Divine Comedy to the basic structure of La voragine (1924) by the Latin- American novelist Jose Eustasio Rivera, ex- cept that the protagonist Arturo Cova's characterization traces a pattern of descent from the paradise of the sierras (Bogota) to the purgatory of the plains (Casanare) and to the hell of the jungles, in which his itinerary of self- destruction comes to an end. In the process, the theologically suggestive Dan- tean elements of the number three and the circle play a significant role as structural determinants in the novel. Milani, Virgil I. "An Anachronism in Dante's Inferno." In Linguistics, No. 103 (Jan. 1978), 51-53. Speculates on how Virgil might possibly have known the Lombard dialect attributed to him in Inferno XXVII, 19-11, when Lombardy did not exist until six hundred years after his lifetime, and concludes that, given Dante's usual accuracy, such anachronisms belong to the realm of poetic license. Mussetter, Sally A. "Inferno XXX: Dante's Counterfeit Adam." In Traditio, XXXIV (1978), 417-435. Construes the figure of Master Adam, beyond his identification with Adam of Brescia, as an analogue of the Old Adam, devoid of spirituality, unredeemed, and nostalgic for the Edenic paradise from which he has fallen- an interpreta- tion sustained by Dante's complex contrasting of the literal and the spiritual reading of signs. In his spiritual blindness, for example, Master Adam can only harp on water in its physicality rather than as a spiritual sign, and he himself has physically assumed the hydroptic shape of the alembic, instrument of the falsifying alchemist's art. Even his falsifying of the coinage represents a perver- sion of the coin as God's traditional sign of the soul to be redeemed, while the three carats of dross that Adam added to the symbolic coin suggest a trinitarian violation of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost "reflected in the soul of man as the created image reflects its Exemplar."

Taking an "integrative" position vis-sl-vis Ezra Pound's Cantos, the author contends there is indeed major form to the work, which he construes as an Odyssean journey in quest of knowledge, "an unfolding of the human spirit in the medium of time," with these two themes of time and spirit serving to polarize the various elements along a perceptible line of development in three stages from an inferno, through zpurgatorio, into iparadiso. While there are clear parallels with Dante's Commedia, e.g., in the initial canto as a microcosm of the overall design, it is far from a question of slavish or io5</page><page sequence="34">Dante Studies, xcix, 1981 mechanical imitation.

Udovitch (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, X977)» PP- i^-M0- In tracing the development of the institution of party as a means of organized, constructive political conflict and its resolution and, within the context of the term's first appearance to designate a political grouping in the adventurous polities of Northern Italy, the author addresses the position of Dante, who denounced the concept of party as leading to civil discord in violation of the ideal of unitas, concordia, and corpus. It was only later among the English thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the North American political theorists of the nineteenth that the institution of party acquired theoretical respectability in the modern system of political op- position. Peterson, Mark A. "Dante and the 3-Sphere." In American Journal of Physics, xlvh, No. ix (Dec. 1979), 1031-1035. Finds in Dante a "stunning" explanation of his universe in Paradiso xxvni, which perfectly describes the "three-sphere" concept of modern cosmology based on Einstein's closed universe. The author provides a mathematical ex- planation (with diagrams) of the "three-sphere," and remarks how the poet gropes "for a language to express an idea conceived intuitively and nonverbally, and in doing so actually gives in essence all three of our mathematical con- structions." Although his tour de force went unnoticed, or not understood, and so had no effect on cosmological thinking, Dante had expressed something entirely new, even to supplying the factor of the fourth dimension, speed of revolution, in order to solve the problem of the relationship between the two semi-universes, the physical spheres and the angelic. Even Dante's use of the term, "depende" (Par. XXVIH, 41) was a stroke of genius for rendering the perfect metaphor to fit his conception. Petronella, Vincent F.

Dante's exploration of the problem in the De Monarchia leads to the conclusion that the Monarch-of- All-Nations must be an everyman figure, while his treatment at the top of Purgatory stresses the possibility for every "clean soul" to be coronated as a "king" over himself. Picone, Michelangelo. "I trovatori di Dante: Bertran de Born." In Studepro- blemi di critica testuale, XLX (Oct. 1979), 71-94. Seeks to explain the change from Dante's favorable opinion of Bertran de Born in the De vulgari eloquentia as model poet of sa/us or armorum probitas and in the Convivio as exponent of liberality, to his later condemnation of him as sower of discord in the Commedia (Inf. XXVIII). Analysis of Bertran's poetry evidently led Dante at first to associate with it the highest level at- tainable by the vegetative soul in man. With a deepening of his philosophical and spiritual thought, Dante saw the limitations for human fulfillment and ultimate happiness in this life and radically revised his system of former models, and with this came the revaluation of Bertran. The author re-inforces the final condemnation of Bertran by marshalling evidence of Dantean parody of his exaltation of the panoply and excitement of battle, and by point- ing out how Dante has echoed much of the hacking and gore sung by Bertran in Canto xxvni before presenting the figure ot Bertran himself at the end. Bertran was a master of words, which should be used to foster communication and unity among men, but which he treacherously bent to the opposite pur- pose. Quilligan, Maureen. The Language of Allegory: Defining the Genre. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1979. 305 p. 11.5 cm. Within her thesis the author discusses at some length Dante's narrative allegory in the Commedia as based on the biblical and Virgilian contexts, characterizing its structure as typologically historical, and compares and con- trasts Dante's allegory particularly with Spenser's in the Faerie Queene, which lacks historicity and is based on personification. There are further references to Dante, passim. Contents'. Foreword: Defining the Genre; 1. The Text; i. Pretext; 3. The Context; 4. The Reader; Afterword: Origins and Ends; Bibliography; Index.

It was a moment when, having reached a peak of intellec- tual maturity, her thinking ran to concepts belonging to the same universe as Dante's. Of further note, the author points out that, departing from established Dante criticism, Sayers considered the Earthly Paradise not a point of arrival but of new departure; she found the perfection of the active life figured in Dante's Celestial Paradise. Shapiro, Marianne. "A Dantesque Alba by Cerveri de Girona." In Kentucky Romance Quarterly, xxv, No. 4 (1978), 509-514. Cites, with text and English version, one of six religious poems by Cerveri de Girona (1140-1180), Aixi con eel c'anan erra la via, representing a depar- ture from the usual erotic alba by its stern moralistic quality. This anti-alba recalls at several points the opening of Dante's Inferno and contains other Dantesque elements. Without necessarily drawing a direct relationship be- tween Dante and Cerveri, this anti-alba represents a late development in the Provencal lyric of superimposing moral and didactic elements onto a courtly, secular genre, pointing to the example of Dante himself. Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr. The First Circle. Translated from the Russian by Thomas P. Whitney. New York: Harper and Row, 1968. (Also, Bantam Books, 1969 and later printings.) 674 p. The novel evinces a number of Dantean parallels; for example, chapter 1, specifically entitled "Dante's Idea," explains the meaning of the title of the novel as an analogy with Dante's Limbo (Inf. TV). (For an interpretation of the work, see Vladimir I.
