During the first season of work in 1952 soundings were made on the Kofina ridge, a space of open ground on the edge of the ancient city of Chios which stood on the site of the modern town. These were published by Anderson in BSA xlix (1954) 123-82. Trials were begun the same year in a prehistoric settlement which had been recognized at Emporio in the territory of Pyrgi in the south of the island. It became clear during the course of this work that Emporio with its sheltered harbour had continued to be an important centre during later times, and in the following years (1953-5) the scope of the excavation was widened to include the exploration of Greek and Roman sites in the area. This work was under the general supervision of Mr. John Boardman, and in the present volume he publishes the Greek sites and the material from them. Through no fault of his, publication was delayed in the hope that it might be possible to present the excavations in a chronological sequence beginning with the prehistoric, Neolithic and Bronze Age material. This scheme has had to be abandoned, and the prehistoric material together with the Roman will appear in subsequent volumes. To the anonymous donor whose original act of generosity and continued support made the excavations possible we owe a deep debt of gratitude; and no less to the other anonymous donors who made it possible for the excavations to develop and expand in scope after the first season of work in 1952. To them, and to all those who assisted in the excavations, both those whose names are mentioned in the text and the many whose names do not appear there, we are most deeply grateful. ¡Sinclair Hood A full account of the circumstances of the excavation and description of the site will appear in Mr. Hood's publication of Prehistoric Emporio, but basic features are also described here, so far as they affect the Greek history of Emporio. The greater part of this volume was written by i960 and it has not always been possible to incorporate the evidence of later publication fully in the discussion of the finds. Subsidiary excavations at Delphinion in North Chios and at Pindakas near Emporio have already been published by the writer in BSA li (1956) 41 ff. and liii-liv (1958-9) 295 ff. and an underwater reconnaissance around Chios in BSA Ivi (1961) 102 ff. Studies based wholly or in part on the Greek finds at Emporio have appeared in Ant.J. xxxix (1959) 170 ff. cChian and Early Ionic Architecture', and in Anatolia vi (1961) 179 ff. 'Ionian Bronze Belts'. Mr. W. G. Forrest publishes the Greek inscriptions from Emporio in BSA lviii (1963) 53 ff. and lix (1964) 32 ff. The drawings and photographs in this volume are by the author. The site plans (figs. 2-4) were prepared by Michael Ventris. The author is indebted to the Craven Fund in Oxford for grants enabling him to visit Chios and work upon the finds; to Professor N. Kontoleon, and Mr. A. P. Stephanou, the tireless epimelete of antiquities in Chios, for their advice and help; to Mr. P. P. Argenti for his encouragement and hospitality in Chios; and especially to Mr. Hood for his counsel both at the time of the excavations and later.

The harbour is well sheltered by a small headland to the north on which stands a mediaeval vigla or watch- tower (plate 1 a, left), and by a rocky acropolis to the south beyond which is a broad pebbly beach (plate 2¿). The fertile valley inland, commanded by Emporio, leads over low hills to the plain around Pyrgi. Vines, olives and mastic bushes are the main crops, with corn around Pyrgi, and deserted terraces on the hill sides indicate that cultivation was once even more intense. Parallel to the coast running south is another rich valley in which stand the remains of the mediaeval village of Dotia. There may have been an ancient site here also but most of the signs of Classical antiquity in this neighbourhood (which will be listed in another place) seem to be isolated farmhouses, and the main centre of occupation was at Emporio, although there may have been other towns at or near Pyrgi and Kalamoti inland. Travellers seem generally to have ignored Emporio, and Zolotas, in his Historia tes Chiou (i 92 1; A. i 458) remarks only the many signs of Byzantine or later construction. D. W. S. Hunt's survey of antiquities in Chios in 1938 led him to Emporio and he recorded late inscrip- tions (BSA xli (1940-5) 37 f.; he describes the harbour, 48 f.). The British School's excavations there were directed first to the signs of Early Bronze Age occupation observed by Mr. Hood in 1952, but as the excavations developed and the site was better explored it proved to offer a valuable archaeological cross-section of the island's history in many different periods. The fortified Early Bronze Age town lay on and below the acropolis beside the harbour, where also there was a Late Mycenaean town, finally occupied in Myc. IIIC by a refugee settlement which may have survived until about 1 100 b.c.1 Of the period with which this volume is concerned a whole village complex was discovered on the hill slopes of Prophètes Elias and selected houses excavated, while on the crown of the hill the circuit of an acropolis wall was found and a Megaron Hall and sanctuary of Athena which lay within it. The town probably took the general form in which we see it in fig. 3 by about 700 b.c. and was abandoned by 600 b.c., although the Athena sanctuary was given a new temple in the mid-sixth century and continued in use until the Hellenistic period. Beside the harbour, but not, it seems, in the area occupied by the Bronze Age town, there was other activity in the Archaic period. This is represented by a series of terraces, in the fill of which are rich deposits of votives ranging in date from the eighth century to about 600 b.c. There is no trace of temple buildings except for a period later than that represented by the votives, when we have the foundations and many mouldings from a mid-fifth-century apsidal temple with four prostyle Ionic columns, and parts of its sixth-century predecessor. From the Hellenistic period the finds are scrappy and inconclusive but there was clearly still an important sanctuary here. The bulk of the pottery and other finds published here are from the deposits by the harbour. A fuller account of the historical conclusions which can be drawn both for this area and for the island from the excavations will be found at the end of this volume and the character of the votive deposits is discussed on pp. 23 ff and 62 ff. Of the period subsequent to that discussed here there are scant finds of pottery of the Early 1 Pending the publication of Prehistoric Emporio see Hood, 'Excavations at Emporio, Chios, 1952-55' in Atti del VI Cong.

The other finds belong mainly to the later sixth and seventh centuries A.D., with the conversion of the basilica to a church with baptistery and the construction of a small walled town on the harbourside acropolis. This occupation was terminated abruptly in the mid-seventh century with the arrival of the Arabs, and was resumed for a while in the ninth century in an impoverished manner. i ; : î - ; - ; - -x 'T "1 "' Î ' / ) Tï"°i yI 1 Me9°ri ' ho1' -'''' /' ,?' / ' jj /} i""w r^'li ■ Aihe.n^sonc/ory s*'' Y ?'.

THE TOWN ON PROPHETES ELIAS 1. INTRODUCTION Mount Prophètes Elias rises to a height of 240 m. immediately north of the harbour of Emporio (fig. 2). Its extent and profile are apparent from plate 2 a-c. In elevation from either the west or the sea (plate 2b) it appears as a regular cone rising steeply to the summit from the north, but it is broken in its descent to the south by a saddle and low ridge to a secondary summit which is 70 m. below and 330 m. away. Its position is a commanding one in this quarter of the island, readily visible from many points far inland and easily recognized by its regular shape ; from the sea too its distinctive outline leads ships from the south to the first good harbour on this coast of Chios. In its immediate setting it dominates the harbour, the valleys to the west and south, and the long valley running north from below it to Kalamoti. Five years before the ancient site was discovered the slopes were sparsely covered with pine trees, as is clear from air photographs which reveal nothing of the antiquities there. Since then a fire has practically denuded its western and southern slopes leaving but few surviving trees and many blackened stumps, but also revealing the outlines and walls of ancient buildings. The lower slopes are cultivated with vines and mastic bushes, but the slope above, where the ancient town and acropolis lay, is too steep to permit effective terracing; too steep, one might have thought, even to allow for houses (plate yd). The hill is composed of a soft, white sand- stone, which is easily worked and still used locally as building material. Its softness is well illus- trated by the grotesque effects of wind and rain erosion on exposed boulders (plate 2¿). It is the only stone employed in all the ancient buildings on the site, but for the very occasional use of stone of a better quality in parts of the temple. There are no signs of regular quarrying on the hill, but this would not have been necessary. The earth which lies over it is hardly more than the white powdered rock itself. The only modern buildings on the hill, but for two or three rubble houses on the lower slopes, are the church which gives it its name, and beside it a new hunting lodge for the citizens of Kalamoti, the town 6 km. to the north, within whose jurisdiction the hill today lies. But here, at the summit, are many traces of earlier buildings, apparently a monastery, including vaulted cisterns and various small terraces, and mediaeval inscriptions are built into the later walls. The archaic Greek site was first discovered in June 1953 by members of the excavation party then investigating the prehistoric and Late Roman sites by the harbour. On the approach to the summit long rubble terraces were observed on what was to prove to be the site of the ancient town. Above them the line of an ancient road was reached and followed onto the saddle of the hill. There the complete ground plan of the temple and its altars was clear; 60 m. away part of the walls of the Megaron Hall was standing free over 1 m. high, and the lines of fallen stones marking the position of the acropolis walls were seen running from either side of the saddle towards the summit. The excavation of the temple area was undertaken in the same summer and continued in 1954 under the writer's direction. In this year also the Megaron Hall, acropolis and town were surveyed and selected areas excavated. In 1955 supplementary digging was conducted and a party of Danish and Swedish students under Dr. M. Krustrup collaborated in investigating one of the houses. B</page><page sequence="13">4 GREEK EMPORIO The plans of the site, town and some houses were prepared by the late Dr. M. G. F. Ventris, O.B.E., with the assistance of his wife. To Michael Ventris' initiative and quick eye is due the identification of many of the houses in the archaic town. 2. THE ACROPOLIS The Walls. Much of the line of the acropolis wall could be determined by surface observation, but excavation at one or two points also helped to make clear details of its thickness and of the entrance (fig. 4) . The wall ran to enclose the summit of the hill, and its line on the east and west approaching it appears as a ribbon of small fallen stones which have collapsed onto the foundations or slipped down the hill-slope (plate 2e) . Its actual line around the summit is not clear. The hill-slope becomes much steeper and the ground much rockier there, so that no part of it remains in situ. In addition its stones had certainly been plundered in later times for the monastery and church which stood at the summit. It is unlikely that it originally enclosed any more than the summit itself, and its line around it might be that of any of the small terraces which stand there. The walls run down thence over the rocky and barren slope to the saddle of the hill. Here its line on the east must have followed the edge of what seems to be a modern terrace above a steep slope to the south-east; thence its line can be traced in its fallen stones to the south summit of the hill. This it perhaps enclosed, or it may simply have run to a look-out point erected there. From the south summit it returns to the north-west above a steep descent to the valley and harbour, and within 100 m. appears the only certainly identified, or indeed practicable, entrance to the circuit. This is approached by a gently inclined road from the north-west, which, immediately beneath the walls, turns sharply back to the north, and enters them through a passageway formed by a simple overlap in the wall-line.1 The depth of this overlap is not certain but the inner wall certainly ran on for at least 25 m. beyond the point at which the road turns the butt end of the outer wall. The passageway was barely 3 m. across and the effective width for wheeled or animal traffic somewhat less, but precise measurements could not be taken as the wall-line is only clear in one or two places, and the steep slope and erosion have between them carried away most of the stones and all trace of any regular gate which may have stood there (plate 30?). At no point was the wall less than 2 m. thick. A trench cut across it 20 m. north-west of the south summit showed it to be 2.30 m. thick and preserved above the rock to a height of 1.30 m. on the outside. Another point at which its face was cleared, 100 m. south-west of the main sum- mit, showed it preserved to a height of 2 m. (plate 3^), but here it abuts onto a great boulder which protected it; elsewhere only its lowest stones are preserved in situ. The outer wall by the entrance was investigated to determine its length, which proved to run almost to the bend in the approach road; here it is also 2 m. thick. Of the inner wall of the entrance all that is pre- served at this point is part of the terracing against the steep slope above; in places it still stands over 1 m. high. The construction of the wall is wretched throughout. None of the stones employed is too heavy for one man to lift unaided, there was no attempt to face them, nor were they laid 1 Compare the south-west door in the archaic fortification wall on Kalabak Tepe (Wiegand, Milet, i.8 27 f., pl. 3). Such an approach ensures that the unprotected side of hostile troops would be exposed to the fire of the defenders on the walls.</page><page sequence="14">freces cf house va/ís heavy house 'ferraces' among modern ierraces 180 m further north A' vV^Vv N, 'Ü' ' ' ' «r l'm' i ìli!

It would certainly never have withstood a deter- mined attack and could only have served as a deterrent to marauding parties from below, at whose approach the acropolis would have served as a place of refuge for the townsfolk from the hillslopes. In fact the only easy approach to the defences lay through the town below them, and even there the gradient is as much as 1 : 1 in places (cf. plate yd).2 No towers were ob- served, and although there may have been some structures at each summit, subsequent building and the steep slope have hidden and carried away all trace of them. Inside the wall, where it was excavated just north-west of the south summit, a short rubble wall 0.50 m. thick abutted onto its inner face. Further investigation revealed neither floors nor any other structure to suggest that there was either a building or a stairway onto the wall at this point. The Area Enclosed. The wall-line, of about 800 m., enclosed an area of rather less than 25,000 sq.m., or 6 acres. The entire north half is a steep boulder-strewn slope with a gradient of ap- proximately 1:2. One small terrace near its foot is the only place at which any building could comfortably have stood, but trial trenches recovered no pottery and the only structures there are a small rubble terrace wall and the ring of a modern charcoal-burner's pit. The ascent to the summit probably lay along the walls, although there seems to have been a path from the south towards the terrace which has just been described. Immediately north-east of the entrance is the saddle of the hill, at the north of which stood the Megaron Hall with its west wall lying over the line of the acropolis wall, and at the east the temple. East and south-east of the temple a number of small terraces lie behind the acro- polis wall and extend, on this side, to the south summit. Trenches dug in them revealed no regular structures or pottery, so their antiquity remains uncertain. South of the temple a rocky ridge overlooks the entrance and runs towards the south summit on the west side. It would appear then that the only stone buildings within the acropolis circuit may have been the Megaron Hall and the temple with its altars. Dating. No pottery whatever was found in the trenches dug against the acropolis wall, but its relation to the Megaron Hall proves that it must be at least as early as that building, no later than the seventh century b.c. It seems, on other grounds, likely that the wall was built early in the history of the occupation of the site and of the practice of cult there, so it may well date from the eighth century. 3. THE ATHENA TEMPLE (a) The Earliest Period The earliest objects which were found in the temple area are decorated vase fragments and terracottas, geometric in decoration and votive in character, which may be dated to the eighth century. Cult practice may then be presumed to have started here at least as early as this, and other pottery and terracottas prove that it continued, apparently uninterrupted, down to the mid-sixth century and the time of the construction of the temple. But although there is no Most ot the dry rubble walls described and listed by Scranton in Greek Walls 146-8, 184 f. are of stones whose faces have been roughly aligned.

Altar A (figs. 7, 13e; plates 50, 6a). The only structure of whose priority in date to the temple we may be reasonably sure is that which stood within the temple cella, beside the new statue base which was built with the temple itself. It may be called Altar A although, as we shall see, its function is not entirely clear.

It is an irregular structure whose four sides, no pair of which are parallel, measure 1.38 (north) x 1.60 (east) x 1.68 (south) x 1.93 m. (west). Its walls are built of rectangular blocks of the local mountain stone which had been roughly trimmed</page><page sequence="21">8 GREEK EMPORIO and irregularly laid, though their present eroded appearance make them seem little more than natural stones. Upright blocks stand at the western corners and along part of the south wall, while the other blocks are laid on their sides and the interstices filled with smaller stones. Behind the big wall blocks is a backing of small stones, and the interior was filled with clean earth. With this construction of upright blocks it seems unlikely that it ever stood higher than its present 0.80 m., but there is no certain evidence for this or for the appearance of its original surface. The whole principle of its construction is at variance with that of the temple with its well-finished ashlar blocks and even its unfaced inner wall blocks laid in courses. In contrast too with the adjacent statue base which was built of similar stone its blocks are worn and eroded on the surface down to their bottoms, and give the impression that they had been exposed for much of their life. The character of the earliest offerings found near by, and the good condition of much of the fragile Chian pottery make it difficult to believe that there was not in fact some oikos for either offerings or a statue at hand; but if there were, all trace of it disappeared with the building of the temple. This involved extensive clearance and cutting back of the rock, as well as the removal of large boulders which may have stood immediately to the east (sheltering Altar A) to a position farther east where they formed the fill of the curved terrace before the door of the new temple. It is deep between these boulders that many of the earliest votives, which had been swept away with them, were found. The intermediate zone, later occupied by the temple porch, was bare of such early material in the lowest level and may represent the original position of the boulders before their removal to make way for the new building. Dating. In the fill of Altar A were found a clay whorl, of the type found in the lowest level outside it, as well as a few fragments of early Chian chalices, hardly earlier than the last quarter of the seventh century. The construction of Altar A should then fall towards the end of the seventh century. Although the temple building may have resulted in some change in its status it remained an object of cult for over two centuries more, as we shall see. Altar Ä* s function. The original purpose of the altar is not at all clear. It is too substantial to be an offering table only, and its importance, which won its preservation in the new temple, is not what we would expect of an offering table, which is really no more than a convenient item of temple furniture. There are no signs of fire on it or on the objects around it, yet it is difficult to regard it as other than an open-air altar which would at the same time have been the focus for the deposit of unburnt offerings. It is at any rate debatable to what extent a structure of this sort would preserve signs of burning as the stone would more readily flake off with the proximity of fire than blacken, and the fire may have burned on slabs above those still pre- served. Its future function was, however, to serve as an offering table within the new temple. Its construction more closely resembles that of the earliest small-rubble altars of the Samian Heraion1 than the later monumental type in good ashlar masonry.2 The earliest structures at the Artemision at Ephesos3 are in some ways comparable, at least in the mystery which surrounds their original function. The 'Earliest Basis' ('A') which is roughly contemporary4 with our Altar A was a rectangular platform (4.34 x 2.86 m.) with faced ashlar walls and filled with earth containing the famous foundation deposit. Its relationship in time and purpose with contiguous structures is obscure. These include another rectangular 1 Yavis Greek Altars 96 f.; AM lviii (1933) Beil. 50, 1-4. 2 Ibid., Beil. 50, 5-6. 0 Hogarth, Excavations at íLphesus 52 it., pls. 1-2; L.ethaby, JHS xxxvii (19 17) 15; Vallois in Mélanges Glotz 839 if.; Weickert, Typen der archaischen Architektur 16 f.; Gjerstad, LAAA xxiv (1937) 22-29; Yavis, op. cit., 98 f.; Matz, Geschichte der griechischen Kunst i 375. 4 Jacobsthal and Robinson, JHS lxxi (1951) 85 fF., 156 ff.</page><page sequence="22">THE ATHENA TEMPLE 9 platform and, joining them, a T-shaped foundation (like the prothysis of an altar).1 It seems too large for a primitive statue base and ill-oriented for a naiskos. None of these structures may ever have been true hearth-altars, but the 'Basis' may have served as the focal point for offer- ings, and perhaps carried the cult image also.2 It may be that in this early period, in which there is still so little evidence about cult practice in Greek lands, cooking and offering were quite separate operations ; the former conducted wherever convenient, the latter directed to an altar or 'basis' which may have carried both offerings and the cult image, and which may have stood in the open air.3 Later, when an oikos is built for the cult statue, a separate structure serves as the hearth-altar and focus for both burnt and unburnt offerings. Some of the sanc- tuaries in Cyprus are of the earlier type. They have only a témenos with an altar which serves as an offering table for unburnt votives and seems almost identified with the deity. There too the transition to its function as a hearth-altar for burnt sacrifice can be traced.4 The possibility that Altar A never served as a hearth-altar should disqualify it as an 'altar' at all in any but the most general sense of the word. I retain the term here for convenience and for want of a better one. A final possibility, that it is no more than a statue base, may be briefly considered. In this case offerings may have been placed by it and, with its statue, it may have been preserved in the new temple beside the newly dedicated second cult statue. The practice is unusual but not unknown, for Pausanias describes just such a juxtaposition of old and new in the Argive Heraion (ii 17.5) and in the Temple of Demeter at Stiris (x 35.5) ; but there the old were in subordinate positions, and although the preservation of the statue would be understandable it is hard to see where the need lay for the preservation of its unsightly and irregular base. Other Remains. The only other remains which can tentatively be associated with Altar A are of a stretch of wall, 6.50 m. long, outside the west wall of the temple and running parallel, not with the temple wall, but with the west wall of Altar A and 3.65 m. from it (plate 4*/). Being at one point only 1 .50 m. from the corner of the temple it is difficult to connect it with that building in any way, even as the edge to a path around it (at any rate pointless in this position). Only the lower stones are preserved and these are roughly finished and laid with their face to the west, backed by smaller stones. An apparent return of this stone backing at the north end of the wall and towards the east may represent an angle in the original construction. It may simply have supported a low platform for Altar A or an enclosure wall around it. There was no pottery in its fill. Even its present top may have been visible after the temple was built. That it might be the back wall of a temple building enclosing the altar, like the temples at Dreros and Prinias5 is, I think, impossible, as it would have to be a building nearly twice the size of the later one, and there is no room for such in this position.6 Deposits. Uncontaminated deposits of votives and pottery of this period were found in the white rock-dust level around Altar A, that is to say beneath the temple floor (see plate 6b; fig. 8), and deep between the boulders forming the terrace east of the temple, as well as immediately 1 Gjerstad, op. cit., 17-19. All were enclosed in the found- ations of the later temple; it is not clear whether the upper part of the 'Basis' was still visible within it. The enclosure of the earlier Heraion on Delos within the later temple is analogous (EADélosxi 145 ff.). 2 As the 'bench' in the temple at Dreros in Crete and the 'banquettes' on Delos. á Schrader emphasizes the importance of the altar in early Greek 'Homeric* religion, as a symbol of the god who dwells elsewhere (Götter und Menschen Homers 59 f.) . 4 References in Yavis, op. cit., 77 ff., and cf.

Here there was part of a vase of which joining fragments were found near Altar A. Some other votives of this period seem to have been swept into a small pile immediately to the west of Altar A, between it and the temple wall, and left here above the general level of the temple floor. (b) The Temple Period The determining factor in the siting of the temple appears to have been the position of the earlier Altar A which was to be preserved beneath its roof. We have already seen reason to suspect that the boulders which were to form a terrace before the temple door had been shifted from a position just east of Altar A to make way for the temple building, and that with them went most of the earliest votives. The bedrock was not, however, cut level to form the temple floor, though it had to be cut back in places to receive foundation blocks for its walls. The temple itself is a simple structure, rectangular in plan (10.13 x 6.23 m.) comprising only a shallow closed porch with a central door, and a nearly square cella (fig. 7). Within the cella, towards the back and slightly to the right of centre as one faced it, stood the old Altar A, and by its side, to the left, a new and smaller base presumably for the cult statue. This was not so far off the axis of the building as to be invisible from outside the front door of the temple. Floor and Foundations. For the floor the rock had not been cut back at all regularly and it must in fact have cropped through the general floor level in more than one place, particularly in the porch. The only place in which the rock has clearly been trimmed for the floor is by the south wall of the cella, to the east of the statue base. The crevices in the rock were filled with working chips from the temple construction and powdery white rock dust which had been trodden hard, and there was no evidence to suggest that the floor surface was anything other than this trodden level, and, in places, the rock. Only for the north, and the northern part of the east and west walls was there need for foundation blocks below the euthynteria, the shallow course which runs round the whole building below the orthostat ashlar blocks of the walls. The natural slope of the ground here is down to the north, to the lowest point on the saddle before the steep ascent to the top of the hill. Blocks less than ' m. deep sufficed for the foundations of the north wall, though at the north-western corner a second shallow slab underlies the main foundation course. It is clear from the inside of the temple that the rock had been cut back to receive these foundations and an appreciable trench left in many places (plate 6b). On the outside the blocks were laid with trimmed faces level with the euthynteria, but on the inside the stones projected, untrimmed, beyond the inner face of the wall, though, of course, below the floor. The ground-level outside the building lay at the top of this foundation course, as did the floor within. For the southern part of the building the rock had been cut back for the euthynteria, or the level adjusted for it with shallow slabs. Outside the south wall of the temple in the east the flat slabs on which the euthynteria rests run out to the rising rock and form a sort of crazy-paving (plate 4¿) . Some slabs were lifted here but no pottery was found beneath them. At the west ends of both the north and south walls and just before their inner corners are two projecting foundation blocks (the northern one almost clear of the main foundation course), with worked faces on the west. Moreover the foundation course for the west wall seems much broader than it is for the other walls. It would appear that we have here evidence for an earlier phase in the temple construction which envisaged its west wall some 0.90 m. farther to the east, and for which foundation blocks had been laid. The plan was abandoned and the building lengthened, perhaps to ensure that there would be room enough to walk behind the earlier</page><page sequence="24">.

This may also account for the faced rectangular stone slab which lay behind Altar A in the fill of the floor, and another (0.40 m. broad) which sup- ported part of the new statue base beside it, if they are not from some earlier building or fallen from Altar A. The Walls. The euthynteria is approximately 0.25 m. deep (most irregular on the south), and on it appears the fine stone-dressing which must have characterized the rest of the masonry of the building also. It is only on euthynteria blocks in the south-west that the working of shallow drafted margins has been preserved at all clearly (plate 4c), the surface of the upper stone-work of the temple having suffered considerably through exposure and the poor quality of the material. Above the euthynteria, and set back 0.03 m. from it, the first course of the wall stands on three of the sides of the building, 0.56 m. high. Only one of the ashlar blocks (at the north-east) is twice as long as it is high, and many are nearly square in elevation. None of the blocks used in the building (but for jambs or lintels) assumed great proportions; the longest construction block, in the euthynteria (south-east), being only 1.76 m. long. The wall blocks CENTURY ^^__^^ "^ ^ JX ■ SIXTH f~~^ CENTURY fig. 9 Schematic E-W Section through Temple and Altar C. had drafted edges for close junction with their neighbours, rough-hewn backs, and were not clamped. Only at the north-east corner does one block fill the width of the wall, and this in the euthynteria. The reconstruction of the upper part of the walls is considered below. The Interior. The floor-level lay at the top of the foundation course, as has been observed. Within the cella the walls were backed with approximately rectangular stones, not properly faced, and laid roughly in courses so that one course corresponds with the euthynteria, and two with each main course of the wall face. Thus three courses of these backing stones are preserved in situ around the cella, except in the south where some had fallen away, and in the back of the porch- wall south of the doorway. Here nothing is preserved but a few small foundation-stones for which the rock had been trimmed on the west, and part of the smashed blocks which had stood above them. The interstices in the walls are filled with earth and rock chips. Unlike the inside of the cella the porch- walls were backed by faced ashlar blocks. These are seen in situ around the three sides of the north half of the porch at the level of the euthynteria, and we may assume that the walls presented the same appearance to their full height. At the back of the porch in the north half a part of the second course is preserved. It was apparently the same height as the first course of the temple walls above the euthynteria. As the porch was probably better lit than the cella and certainly more immediately conspicuous this more careful treatment of its walls is understandable. The Doors. The threshold of the front door of the temple has disappeared. The present block,</page><page sequence="28">THE ATHENA TEMPLE 13 and the two steps before it, are fourth-century replacements and additions (fig. 13^; plate 6c). We do not know whether there was a step or steps before the door in the original building but there was call for at least one. The original threshold must have been at euthynteria level; there are no means of knowing what type of door it carried.1 On the floor of the porch in the north lay the shattered fragments of a block which, from its position, embedded deep in the later floor, I would prefer to associate with the original front door. If so, it should be its northern jamb. It was of Chian blue-grey marble, and its face measured 1.95x0.50 m. This was well-smoothed, but the sides were poorly finished and the back left rough. Its depth was 0.29 m. at the east end as it lay, that is to say at the bottom of the jamb, and 0.23 m. at the top. On the flat top edge and by the face was a drafted band 0.055 m- deep which may have borne the lintel of stone or wood. The original inner doorway to the cella was preceded by a step at floor level, which is pre- served, and another serving as the threshold, which is not (fig. 13a; plate 6d). The present threshold is a fourth-century replacement. The preserved step is a well-cut block, 1.34 x 0.38 x 0.17 m., flanked by two smaller ones which had been cut to fit closely to the stumps of the rear porch- wall. The stone is again the local white stone but of a better quality, capable of taking and preserving a finer finish. Behind this step the bedding for the original threshold was of three squared blocks, the centre one of which had been disturbed in the course of the fourth-century reconstruction. On the east the rock had been cut back to admit the step, and a similar cutting on the west suggests that there may have been another such step behind the threshold and within the cella. Whether there was a door here; whether indeed one was required with a closed porch, I cannot say. The Bases. Altar A stood within the cella, possibly in much the same condition in which it stands today. Flush by its side, and with their backs in a line, stood a smaller base (fig. 136; plates 5¿, 6a) which must certainly be contemporary with the building of the temple, both on stratigraphical grounds and in view of the way the bases together stand symmetrically central at the back of the cella. The base is almost square (1.08 x 1.08 m., and 0.31 high at the west) and consists of four large and one small blocks, all most carefully finished on the top, but left rough on the faces with the exception ofthat on the west (the invisible back!), the west block on the south face, and the upper 0.10 m. of its neighbour to the east. Thus, the most conspicuous face, on the east, remained unfinished in appearance. The central cavity which may have held a support for the statue was full of clean earth. The upper edges of the base had been cut back 0.03-4 m- and to a depth of 0.0 1 m. giving the appearance of a bevelled and grooved edge. A band 0.145 m. wide at east and west, and 0.19 m. at the north (and no doubt the south) had been carefully smoothed at the edges of the surface of the base. It seems likely that these supported a coping of some sort which enclosed the base of the statue itself. On the temple floor around the base were found fragments of fine white stone, 0.12 m. thick, carefully smoothed on both faces and side, and finished with a pointed tool.2 These may have stood on the base to form a coping (as replaced in plate 5*/), but unfortunately no complete length or height of the blocks could be determined (the greatest height was 0.23 m.). The rock had been cut back for the base on the east, and its south-western corner was supported by the squared block which has been noted above. 1 On the fortunes of a foundation block below it see below p. 20. 2 Another fragment appears with the small stone packing in the fourth-century reconstruction of the cella door. As the stone is similar to that of the preserved original step before the cella door suspicion might arise that we are dealing rather with fragments of the original cella threshold, but the fragments are too thin, are finished on both sides, and show no signs of wear.</page><page sequence="29">14 GREEK EMPORIO Reconstruction and Roof.

This is particularly 1 At the top of the hill, where the church of Prophètes Elias now stands, there seems to have been the site of a mediaeval monastery with cisterns, out-buildings and small terraces. This may have been the destination of the broken and fallen blocks.</page><page sequence="30">THE ATHENA TEMPLE 15 fortunate because the wall seems to have fallen as a single mass, and the blocks lay on the ground preserving clearly their original relative positions and courses (plate 40). A second factor of value in the reconstruction of the walls is the presence of pry-holes on the tops of the wall blocks which indicate the approximate position and size for the blocks of each course above. Blocks from four courses lay on the ground and on the basis of their positions and of the pry- holes a paper reconstruction of the north wall can be made (fig. 10). It will be noted that the courses diminished slightly in height towards the top, from 0.56 m. for the course in situ, to 0.54, 0.51, 0.50 and 0.49 m. for the topmost course. As this last course gives the walls an overall height from floor level of 2.85 m. we may safely assume that this represents their original complete height. Of the interior supports for the roof only one column base remains in situ in the north-east quarter of the cella, 1.72 m. from its walls. This was a small cylinder of the local white stone 0.185 m« high and 0.30 m. in diameter. It had a finished top, which lay level with the floor, and roughly hewn sides (plate 66, right). The rock had been cut back a little where it rested. From its position, approximately one-third of the way across the cella from north to south, we may safely assume that there was another between it and the south wall, and one was indeed found there, shifted somewhat from its original position during the fourth-century reconstruc- tion;1 it was 0.20 m, high and had an average diameter of 0.27 m. Two other bases were also found in the cella: one (0.17 m. high and 0.27-30 in diameter) behind Altar A within the fill of the fourth-century reconstruction in that corner of the building; and another (0.48 m. high and 0.28-30 in diameter) built into the wall which had been erected in the same period north of Altar A.2 The former may have stood near the position in which it was found, behind Altar A, perhaps even on the slab found in the floor there ; the latter should then be from be- hind the statue base, and perhaps stood on the block supporting the north-west corner of the base, or beside it. The four column bases would not then lie symmetrically in the cella but this may not matter. The western pair had to be near the wall because of Altar A and the statue base. That they were still necessary can be judged from the 'safe' span which was allowed by the builders and which we can estimate from the base in situ and from the depth of the porch. The columns themselves must have been of wood. That they supported a flat roof is suggested by several things. First, the lack of any gable blocks when so many of the wall blocks are preserved and in view of the probability (not certainty) that a building with ashlar stone walls would have gables of stone, if any at all. Only one block was found with any sort of cutting, and this was a rectangular inset, possibly from beside a door (fig. 13*/). Secondly, the deposit of clayey earth above the temple floor seems neither to have been put there deliberately nor to have accumu- lated naturally, but could most easily represent the earth-packing above a flat timber roof.3 In this respect the building has much in common with the seventh-century houses in the town on the slopes of the hill (see Section 6) . These had up to four column bases of exactly the type found in the temple, but placed so eccentrically as to make it highly improbable that they supported anything other than a flat roof. In these circumstances the earth packed on the roof would have been held at the edges by stone slabs above the wall forming a coping which would probably have projected. Shattered slabs between 0.09 and 0.14 m. thick were found around the temple and may have served this purpose originally. One found within the temple porch was nearly intact and measured 0.58 x 0.54 x 0.09 m. 1 It lay between the base which is in situ and the south- east corner of the cella, slightly tilted and with its bottom some o. 10 m. above the rock. * A stone in the fourth-century terrace wall to the east of the temple appears to have been a similar base but it is very worn. It is 0.33 m. high and 0.30 m. in diameter. 3 The few iron nails found in and near the temple may as easily be from some wooden furniture or the doors as from the timbering of the roof.</page><page sequence="31">l6 GREEK EMPORIO The Setting. The orientation of the building is due east-west. When it was standing the back wall of the temple must have been clearly visible from the valley below if there were no trees very close to it, and its front wall visible from the sea to anyone approaching from the north. In effect the standing course of its rear wall can still be seen from the modern road to Pyrgi, and the spoil tip below the terrace from the sea to the north. The building, however, lay out of sight of the houses on the hill-slope and of Emporio harbour. The Terrace (fig. 5 ; plate 50) . Much of the terrace before the door of the temple is composed of the boulders which, we have seen reason to believe, were moved to make way for the temple construction. Only in one place is preserved traces of the wall which was built at the same time as the temple, or very soon afterwards (plate 50, below) . It contained the earth and stones, and held them from slipping onto the flat terrace below which lay just within the acropolis circuit. The stretch of wall is 4.65 m. long and at one point 1 .0 m. high, due east of the south wall of the temple. The construction is good rubble, roughly faced, in striking contrast with the quality of the double walls which were built to help raise the level of the terrace in the fourth century, and which may have replaced other parts of the temple-period wall. The wall retains a fill of earth and stones between the boulders which contains votive material of the same date as that in the lowest level in the temple. Pottery of the same date was found in the fill before the wall-footing, which is fortunately not disturbed since it was retained by other boulders farther down the slope. In the top of the fill some working chips from the temple construction ap- peared. Above this undisturbed level was found a number of scattered votives of the temple period swept over the terrace, including a bronze Chian coin of the late fifth or early fourth century. Altar B. At a distance of 2.75 m. to the north of the temple lay a long rectangular altar running parallel to the main axis of the temple (fig. i i ; plate 4/). Its shape could be roughly made out before excavation, but did not become much clearer because of the erosion in that area and the condition of the altar walls. Two of its corners are fixed by the flat foundation blocks which lie in situ at the west end and give the width of the structure, 2.50 m.; on one of them a pry-hole used for the positioning of the blocks above is visible. About 2 m. of the south wall of the altar had collapsed and slewed off its original line, and only one or two of the blocks in the north wall remained in situ, others having fallen, broken, into the eroded centre part. Foundation blocks were fortunately required at the west end, while elsewhere the rock was cut back to receive the walls, which were of ashlar white stone blocks, and faced on both sides. Each being approximately ' m. thick this left an empty core about '' m. wide. The east end of the altar could not be determined accurately, but the rock begins to rise here and there are no signs of further cuttings, so the end should lie approximately where it is indicated in fig. ii, giving an overall length of 7 m. Evidence of only one course, 0.48 m. high, remains, but on the analogy of similar structures elsewhere another may be reasonably restored, perhaps with a projecting coping above. It seems likely that orthostat blocks from Altar B were removed for the construction of Altar C, which succeeded it in the fourth century. Other blocks near Altar B have a depth of 0.64 m. which may represent its second course; that this is the breadth of the block which forms the later second step outside the temple door may not be fortuitous. In the excavation the only undisturbed level below the surface drift of rock dust was one of blackened earth at a point opposite the preserved part of the south wall and level with its base. In view of the very disturbed and eroded character of this area and the utter lack of pottery we cannot infer from this level that the altar was filled with ash or burnt matter, although this is quite possible. Altar B can be assumed contemporary with the temple on the grounds of its</page><page sequence="32">THE ATHENA TEMPLE 17 similar construction and in the absence of any other altar which can be associated with the earliest period of the building. Dating. The date of the construction of the temple is determined by the latest material found in the pre-temple deposits and the earliest from above the temple floor. The latest in the former class are Chian chalices decorated in the black-figure style with figures of komasts, some with debased filling ornament of simple round rosettes without scalloped edges, others without any filling whatever. These may be dated to the second quarter of the sixth century, and possi- bly as late as the middle of the century. The earliest pottery on the temple floor included fragments of an Attic Droop cup, a black-figured Chian kantharos of the third quarter of the century, and plain Chian chalices.

Votives of the main period of the temple's use were scattered all over the cella floor and many had been heaped behind Altar A in the fourth-century reconstruction which in- volved the raising of the level in the north-western corner. Some had been almost tidily stacked before being buried in this way. Thus the base of a limestone kore statuette was found crammed into the lower part of a jar and beside it, behind Altar A, the lower part of a marble kore statuette stood on one of the column bases of the original temple interior. Little was found in the porch, and very little outside the west and north walls on the original ground level. Rather more came to light in the stone fill which, in the fourth century, raised the level of the terrace to the east below the new altar (C), and some sweepings were found outside the only preserved stretch of the original terrace wall at the south-east.</page><page sequence="33">l8 GREEK EMPORIO Comparable Structures. By modern standards the temple could be described better as a chapel than a church. Its size can certainly be paralleled in archaic Greece in both temples and trea- suries but its simplicity cannot. Here are no façade columns, no pediments, no architectural mouldings or terracottas. In fact all that distinguishes it from the earlier houses on the slopes below it is the quality of its masonry and regularity of plan. It is not even larger than many of the houses, and though in a commanding position, can hardly be considered imposing. Similar in plan are the treasuries at Olympia and Delphi, many of which are of about the same date, but these, as show pieces, presented columnar façades and all the richness of Greek archaic architectural moulding and sculpture in stone and clay. 1 Chios did not lag behind the rest of the Greek world in these matters ; rather the opposite, as the elaborately carved mouldings from Phanai and from the temple by the harbour at Emporio testify. ^^i y ^ ^ ^ &lt;y ^ &lt;r¿S fig. 1 2 Restored isometric of the sixth-century Temple. The only true parallel for the temple's construction lies in the houses of its predecessor's parishioners on the slopes of the hill below it. The four columns within the square room, the flat roof, the beginning at least of a closed porch, all are familiar in the domestic architecture of the town (see Section 6), while the more durable and finished masonry2 of the temple be- fitted better the status of its occupant. The excellence of the masonry is particularly well illus- trated by the incidence of drafted margins in the euthyn teria blocks. These are only decorative, but it is one of the earliest examples of this technique in Greek lands. Scranton has suggested that it was learned from the east.3 The only datable earlier instance of it in Greece is in Ionian Miletos,4 and indeed all sixth-century examples of it seem to be Ionian.5 Altar A, which now stood by the statue base in the cella, must have changed its function to that of offering table alone. For one thing, the temple was provided with a large altar (B) to the 1 The nearest Ionian parallel in size and date is the temple on Kalabak Tepe (Wiegand, Milet i.8 16 ff.; Weic- kert, op. cit., 140 f.).

Even so the only close parallels are to be found in the earlier temples on Andros, and on Crete at Dreros and Prinias where other, traditional, features are involved.1 It is in fact the temple of Apollo Delphinios at Dreros2 which best matches this arrangement of offering table beside cult statues, or the 'banquettes' in the archaic temple G and earlier Heraion on Delos3 which must have served for both cult statues and offerings. Altar A would thus have retained part at least of its original function, as a focus for offerings. As there seems to be no positive evidence that it was ever a hearth-altar, and as it was still in a position of first importance (although now shared), the transition was neither abrupt nor difficult. The resultant plan for the interior of the temple was rather awkward. Ideally the cult statue should have stood centrally, facing the door, and not masked by the internal columns. It was still in fact visible from the front door, although only just. Early Greek temples with a single row of columns within displaced their cult statues to one aisle.4 The long rectangular altar (B) is of the type classified as Low Monumental by Yavis,5 and characterized by him as probably chthonic in character. They are in fact little more than elaborate curbs to long pits although their hollow cores would be filled with ash. Despite the possible presence of such burnt matter in the lowest level of the altar its possible chthonic character cannot be stressed. Its construction is more closely paralleled by that of the great altar of Demeter Malophoros at Selinus,6 which is much larger, than by those at Sparta which are nearer it in size.7 The Selinus altar also suggests the second course and projecting coping which appear in the restoration in fig. i i . Neither temple nor altar seem to have been planned in detail with reference to any standard unit of measure, nor need this be looked for in buildings of this size and simplicity.8 (c) The Reconstruction Period The deposit of clayey earth above the original temple floor probably represents the fall of its flat wood and earth roof. Certainly some such collapse was the occasion for the radical changes which were made in the interior of the temple and outside it. These, in brief, involved the building of walls by Altar A to raise the north-western corner of the cella, the replacement of both door- thresholds and addition of steps before the front door, the construction of a double wall to retain the terrace to the east of the temple, and a new altar (C) which stood on this terrace (figs. 5, 6c) . The Temple Interior. The new level for the floor within the temple was approximately 0.20 m. higher than it had been before. Below it lay earth from the probable collapse of the roof, and 1 On temples with interior altars see Nilsson, Opuscula Selecta ii 204-10. For an archaic example at Antikyra, BCH lxxix (1955) 257.

So far as we know there was no ancient equivalent to the Paris metre, although tile standards were understandably published for observance in agoras (Athens, Assos), and compare the Metrological Relief in Oxford. An important unit of measure in archaic buildings seems to have been the standard width of a mud brick, a dimension retained for the walls of some all-stone buildings like our temple. G</page><page sequence="35">20 GREEK EMPORIO the pottery and votives of the main period of the temple's use. The new floor, as the earlier one, was no more than the trodden earth surface, and apparently very uneven. The main constructional innovation in the interior was the enlargement of Altar A in the north-western corner of the cella, presumably to make it more capacious in its function as a depository for offerings. The change also provided a sealed cache for some of the earlier offerings from the temple interior. In fact most of the votive pottery which can with confidence be associated with this period, after the reconstruction, are from the topmost, almost surface level in this corner of the building. The change was effected by two poor rubble walls which ran from the south-west and north-east corners of Altar A to the walls opposite them (plate 5/). Behind them was a fill of small stones and earth, apparently from the temple floor, containing many votives of the temple period. The way in which some of the votives seem to have been stacked there before being buried has already been noted. What became of the statue from the adjacent base can only be guessed, but the stone which may have formed a coping for the base was smashed, and fragments of it found both below the new floor level and built into the reconstruction of the new cella doorway. Of the four column bases in the original plan only one remained in situ, below the new floor, and two others lay in the fill behind Altar A. A rectangular slab (0.80 x 0.65 m.) which lay centrally in the cella with its upper surface level with the new floor may have carried the only support for the new roof (plate 6a bottom right) . The slab rested on smaller stones packed around and under it, to make way for which a hole had been dug down to the rock. A few fragments of tile were found in the surface level of the temple between the fallen blocks. As they include parts of both cover and ridge tiles it seems possible that the building was provided with a tiled, and so probably low-pitched roof. Tile fragments would have been more readily plundered for building purposes, especially for ovens, in the mediaeval monastery at the top of the hill; if so they were very thoroughly plundered and I would hesitate to affirm too strongly that so few scraps can be evidence only for a fully tiled roof. 1 The Doors. No trace remains of the original threshold of the front door. The fall of the roof, which may have carried with it the door frame (the northern jamb had fallen and was found smashed), could well have destroyed it also. Certainly the fall there was heavy enough to break one of the foundation blocks below the threshold, which may mean that the original threshold was only of wood. This foundation block was broken into two pieces : the larger was dragged into the porch where it lay in the depth of the new floor, while the smaller was pushed a little outside the doorway where it was found lying beneath the first step (fig. 13c; plate 6c). The fragments join and their width exactly fills the gap in the foundations. This gap was filled with smaller stones to support the rough base of the new stone threshold which was set above it. The two front corners of the threshold were cut back to make sockets for the door, and, near its front edge, is one rectangular sinking for the door bolt, and room for another at a point where the stone is broken away. Pry-holes near the rear two corners may indicate the width of the jambs (no doubt wooden) ; the sides of the threshold beyond them are smooth, being protected by the jambs. Near the north socket the door, in opening and shutting, wore a shallow groove in the stone. Two steps were set before the door. The first comprises two blocks whose surface is barely 0.05 m. below that of the threshold. The second is a single block 0.25 m. lower. They were supported by the stone and earth fill which covered the terrace, and are crude, roughly cut stones. The breadth of the second tallies with the suspected height of the second course of 1 Scraps of similar tiles were found on the surface near the north-east corner of the Megaron Hall, perhaps dropped en route to the top of the hill.</page><page sequence="36">THE ATHENA TEMPLE 21 Altar B from which it may have been taken. That they post-date the main temple period is proved by the fragments of a figurine, typical of the temple period, which was found beneath the first step. The original cella threshold is also missing and the blocks beneath it were disturbed in the reconstruction. In its place, but not exactly in the centre, was set a new stone threshold rather better squared than that at the front door. Beside it two smaller blocks filled the gap to the rear porch- walls (fig. 130; plate 6d). All rested on a fill of earth and small stones, and 0.20 m. to the west another row of small stones seems to serve no other purpose than to fill the trench cut in the rock for a hypothetical original step or wider threshold to the cella.

The long Altar B to the north apparently went out of use, and the position chosen for the new altar was the more usual one in Greek sanctuaries, before the temple door. There was no room here for a pretentious structure, like Altar B, and the new altar is less than a quarter of the area of the old, only 3 . 1 o x 1 . 2 2 m. All that is preserved is its foundation which are two courses of rectangular blocks laid flat, but not regularly, the gaps being filled with small stones. Pry-holes around its edges suggest that a row of orthostats stood above them, and the appearance and character of the whole may not have been much unlike that of</page><page sequence="37">22 GREEK EMPORIO Altar B, though it is of course much smaller. The height of the course above the foundations is given by blocks fallen nearby; it was about 0.55 m. It is possible that the foundation blocks are the orthostats removed from Altar B which had been superseded. The altar rested on the very loose stone and earth upper fill of the terrace. The Terrace. As the terrace was now to be the site of the new altar it was desirable that its surface should be raised and made more regular. This was effected by a loose fill of stones and earth in the midst of which were found some of the votives and pottery of the main temple period. The fill was retained by two terrace walls, the second and lower of which followed approxi- mately the line of the original terrace wall, and overlapped it at the point at which this is still preserved (fig. 5) . Both new walls are of poorly laid rubble and compare unfavourably with the little which remains standing of the earlier wall (plate 50) . Effectively to retain the fill behind them they were constructed with their faces slightly battered, unlike the earlier wall which is quite perpendicular. They did not even rest upon the rock, but over the thick layer of earth and stones containing the votives of the earliest period on the site before the temple was ALTAR C ^Lf^^^H1^ t&gt;_J v "i* ' '' V &lt; 3.10m. - ^-&gt; FIG. 14 built. The line of the walls continues on the south as far as the edge of the rocky platform just south of the temple, and at the north the inner wall runs onto the nearly level ground. This shows that the whole terrace was brought up to the level of the new altar's foundations and the second step outside the temple door. Dating. The archaeologist in Chios is particularly fortunate in this period in the dating evidence which is provided by what are almost the commonest finds, the wine amphorae, and by that part of them which is most easily recognized, their toes. The latest objects antedating the reconstruc- tion in the temple are amphora toes which are certainly no later than the third quarter of the fourth century. Two examples were found beneath the rubble wall north of Altar A in the temple cella, two in the upper fill of the terrace (one of them with half an amphora actually beneath Altar C) and two others in the stone backing of the later and inner terrace wall. The latest types of figurine in the fill of the north-west corner of the cella are of dancers who can hardly be dated later than the amphorae. There seem to be no grounds for suspecting that the temple remained out of commission for long before the reconstruction, which I would therefore put before the end of the fourth century, perhaps as early as its third quarter. Epilogue. Near the surface, and between the fallen blocks in the temple porch were found fragments of a glass cup of the type familiar in the sixth-century a.d. Basilica Church by Em- porio harbour. Even in its present deforested and exposed condition the temple area is attractive for its fine view, so this evidence of a Late Roman picnic there need neither surprise nor detain us.</page><page sequence="38">THE TEMPLE CULT AND OFFERINGS 23 4. THE TEMPLE CULT AND OFFERINGS The Deity. A fragmentary Chian plate (plate 6o, 785) which was found behind Altar A within the cella in the first season's excavation figures a standing armed female figure, apparently Athena, who was then tentatively identified as the temple deity. Welcome confirmation came in the second season when, on the rock less than 1 m. south-east of Altar A, a fragment of the rim of a Chian cup was found bearing the inscription A0r|vocr| (plate 98, 622), presumably to be restored tt|i [A0r|var|]i and a dedication of the type met on Chian vases from Naukratis, Aegina and Phanai.1 The back of the sherd was decorated with a white and red rosette; this, the rim pattern above the inscription, and the letter forms point to a date in the second quarter of the sixth century. Instead of the usual Homeric and Ionic form of the goddess's name, sA0r|vaiTi we have the spelling 'A0r|var| which recurs in an archaic dedication from Miletos.2 The figure of Athena on the plate is particularly interesting and merits further discussion here. The plate can be dated by its ornament not later than the first quarter of the sixth century. This means that we have here the earliest certainly identifiable Ionian representation of an armed Athena (they are seen elsewhere in Greece),3 and of a type unsuspected so early in Ionia or the mainland. The only other types of an Athena which are admissible so early are the seated unarmed Athena, and the armed Palladion with raised spear and shield on arm. The former, the seated Athena, seems Ionian4 and is possibly the earliest Attic type, while the Palladion5 clearly derives from the simple pillar image furnished with spear, shield and helmet, becoming more anthropomorphic with the passage of time, and best known in the Peisistratid Athena familiar from many Attic vase-paintings. Our Athena stands with her shield on her left arm and her spear held at a slight angle with its butt on the ground just behind her feet. The spear was probably in her right hand which was held far back, but it could have been with her shield in her left hand leaving the right free to hold some other object. Such an isolated figure on a votive offering (the plate was pierced for suspension), and painted deliberately for dedication in an Athena temple, presumably the one in which it was found, could well be considered a representation of the cult statue of that temple. It might then be taken as evidence for a new archaic Athena type, in many ways a simpler one than the Palladion with its raised spear. That the goddess's feet are represented apart in the painting does not mean that the original was of a moving figure. 1 A detailed account of these inscriptions by Cook and Woodhead in BSA xlvii (1952) 159 ff.; and cf.

If the figure on the subgeometric votive shield from Samos (AM lviii (1933) 120 f., Beil. 37, i) is wearing an aegis, it might be an Athena (literary and late numismatic evidence for an Athena with a thunderbolt in Cook, Zeus ni 867 if.).

Others by Endoios were at Erythrai and Athens (Raubitschek, Dedications 491 ff.). The Athena Polias in the Old Temple at Athens was probably seated (cf.

Before the end of the century a similar Athena, not a cult statue, but at ease, appears in the group with Ajax and Achilles on the Athenian Acropolis.2 The best-known later examples of the pose in sculpture are the Athena from the Aegina east pediment, and the Pheidian Medici type in which some have seen a copy of the bronze Athena Pro machos on the Acropolis.3 Cult. Athena was, with Apollo Delphinios, one of the foremost Ionian deities. To confine our- selves to only the major Ionian cities we have literary and inscriptional evidence to indicate her worship in almost all of them,4 and Herodotos alleges (i 147. 2) that they all (except Ephe- sos and Kolophon) celebrated the Apaturia festival which in Athens at least was devoted to Zeus Phratrios and Athena.5 The foundation of the settlement on Prophètes Elias may not have been a purely 'Ionian' one. Traditionally it was the Abantes from Euboea who came to Chios at the time of the Ionian Migration, and this might refer to the settlement or re-settlement of East Greek sites in the Geometric period. Athena would be no less appropriate if installed here by Abantes; and indeed she is commonly found in the Aeolic cities to the north, often as the major deity of the community.6 Her close association here with the ruler of the town might, however, betoken an Ionian aristocratic domination of an Abant community. This possibility I discuss elsewhere. Strabo records a seated Athena statue in Chios itself (xiii 601) and it was from the sanctuary of Athena Poliouchos that Paktyas was surrendered to the Persians by the Chians (Hdt. i 160.3). Both statue and shrine may have been in Chios town, and a seated type for the Polias is attested elsewhere.7 Other references to Athena in Chios are as Alalkomene,8 and in dedicatory in- 1Jahn no. 506, Davreux, La Légende de la Prophetesse Cassandre pl. 21, fig. 40. Cf. the newborn Athena, Cook, Zeus iii 682 fig. 492, and the Athena standing between cock- columns on a Panathenaic-type amphora in the position usually occupied by the striding Palladion type, BM B139 (CVA i pl. 5,3a; ABV 139). 2 Schrader, Die archaischen Marmorbildwerke der Akropolis 286 f.; Schefold, Jdlìii (1937) 30-33. 3 Chamoux (BCH lxviii/lxix (1944-5) 229 ff., and see Lacroix, op. cit., 281 ff.) cites imperial Athenian coins, in which an Athena standing on the Acropolis is represented, as proof that the Promachos held a Nike in her right hand and that her shield was at her left side on the ground. This seems reasonable though the statue's similarity to the Parthenos is then remarkable. It is not likely that the Parthenos is in fact shown on the coins standing before her temple because she could not be shown in it, as this is an artistic convention long outgrown, but it is surprising that the Medici type (Lippold, RE, s.v. 'Phidias' 1924 f., Griechische Plastik 155 f. for references) cannot be associated with any recorded Pheidian statue in view of its great popularity in antiquity (Chamoux, op. cit., 235 ff.). The problem is not as simple as Lacroix suggests. Lippold doubted whether it was the Pro- machos that was taken to Constantinople and destroyed by the drunken mob in a.d. 1203. Jenkins adduces a drawing in an 1 ith-century MS which shows an Athena with spear at rest in her right hand and shield by her left side on the ground standing on a column, and believes it to be the Promachos in Constantinople (JHS lxvii (1947) 31-33 pl. 10: Lippold is quoted as Sieveking; he publishes another MS illustration in BSA xlvi (1951) 72-74 pl. 11). This type is like neither of the two other candidates. Jenkins quotes coin illustrations (Shear, Hesp v ( 1 936) pls. 7.35, 9. 1 5, 1 6, 24, 25 ; she considers the Medici type the Promachos, ibid, 325) of an Athena whose shield does not lean against her, who wears no aegis, but a himation swathed across her, and who for this more closely resembles the medallion on which Stevens bases his reconstruction of the Athena and Poseidon group on the Acropolis {Hesp xv (1946) 11 fig. 14; and cf. Farnell, Cults i pl. 14a). Another figure wearing aegis and with her shield at her side, most like the MS illustration, appears on coins (Shear, op. cit., 318 fig. 24.1 ; pls. 7.31, 32; 9.1) and the tree beside her makes one think again of the group with Poseidon rather than the Promachos and the sacred olive which stood behind her on the Acropolis.

Minas on the south coast, 1 on another un- published inscription there of which Mr. Forrest has told me, and on one from Mesta.2 Athena Apotropaia, Nike and Phemia occur in an Erythraean inscription3 which includes Chian place- names and cults apparently shared by the two states. It is as a Polias or Poliouchos4 that she was worshipped in our temple though we cannot of course be certain that either epithet was regularly here applied. Such was her original func- tion, guardian of house, palace or city, to Homer ápuaí-nroAis, and her position here, on an acropolis apparently shared only by her sanctuary and the hall of the local ruler, illustrates this well.5 In fact whatever structure accompanied her cult here in the eighth or seventh century served the ruler in his Megaron Hall 50 m. away as his Lady Chapel. Her office of guardian was not of course only to be exercised in time of war, despite her warlike appearance, but it was also domestic and probably agrarian. This may account for the apparently chthonic character of her altars, all of which are basically of the hollow type, although the foundations of the latest (Altar C) seal off immediate access to the ground beneath from its core. Cult Statues. Her earliest image, here as elsewhere, may have been no more than a simple pillar of wood, probably roughly fashioned into human shape and accoutred with some of her warlike attributes, perhaps like the Palladion type (see above) . Not, then, very unlike the fragmentary figurine from the earliest deposits by the temple whose plain plank-like body6 is enhanced only by the addition of simply modelled breasts and feet; head and arms are unfortunately missing (plate 76, 65). An even more striking representation of the early cult image may be seen in another fragmentary figurine whose body was wheel-made. Breasts are again represented and the two arms, of which we have only the stumps, were bent forwards in a position which might easily have supported shield and spear (plate 75, 61). It is, moreover, possible that the strange conformation of the cheeks and the ridges at the side of the head are meant to represent the cheek-pieces of a helmet, but with the worn surface of the figurine and so many details either debatable or missing this identification cannot be pressed too far. I have given above reasons for belief that the appearance of the cult statue in the early sixth century may be as the Athena represented on the fragmentary votive plate found in the temple. Taking this assumption a stage further we may note that the core of the statue could still be the same, or at least the type unaltered from that suggested by the wheel-made figurine just mentioned whose spear arm is held forward and not up in the Palladion style.7 What was the cult statue of the new temple which was built in the middle of the sixth century ? Seated figurines were found dedicated in it but none are Athenas and they are better interpreted as attendants although the goddess is known in East Greece in a domestic character at Erythrai and Troy, where she held a spindle.8 It should, however, be noted that by the time these seated figures were dedicated, in the fifth century, the temple had ceased to be a central town shrine 1 Haussollier, BCH iii 324 no. 10. 2 'AÔr|vãxx227, AA'. 3 Dittenberger, Syll.3 iii 150 ff. no. 10 14, lines 25, 65, 115. 4 Thus known in Chios, Erythrai, Phokaia (above, n. 7, p. 24) of the major Ionian cities, but also in many others in Asia Minor.

The statue base preserved in the temple cella could have supported a life-size seated figure but the plan as well suits a standing figure and it is safer to assume that the statue on it did not differ radically in type from that which we suspect to have served before, and that it may even have been the same one. If, as is suggested above, the end of the main period of the temple's history came with the collapse of its roof the statue presumably suffered also (the base coping was shattered) and was perhaps destroyed. The subsequent reconstruction period was short-lived, and though a new statue may have been dedicated we cannot be sure of this. If the sixth-century statue was wooden no trace of it can of course be expected to have survived. But, if wooden, certainly parts of its A © V - I ' C D fig. 15 Helmets with animal protomes at the peak. decorative equipment would have been of another, probably less perishable material, and it is worth while looking among the objects of the temple period found within the cella and, with a statue of an armed Athena in mind, see whether some of its trappings are not in fact preserved. Thus, the one iron spearhead found might as well be from Athena's spear as an offering to her. But there is one group of objects which is particularly difficult to associate with any known form of votive offering and which may find its place here. These are nine small griffin protomes made of solid lead, with short spikes for attachment behind (plates 84-5, 166). Most of the heads are turned slightly, four to the left, four to the right, while one, which is also slightly larger, is frontal. The material is too soft for them ever to have been wedged into a stone object without seriously damaging them, and the attachment is not one suited for application to a metal bowl or tray, and at any rate the variation in size and the inclination of the heads makes it</page><page sequence="42">THE TEMPLE CULT AND OFFERINGS 27 difficult to restore them as part of any such regular artefact. But they might easily fit into slots made in wood, and if not into a wooden bowl or tray, then perhaps into the wooden cult statue. Two alternatives then present themselves, the first of which may be dismissed with a mention. Athena's aegis is in origin a raw hide whose rough curly edges become tassels and stylized in art as snakes' heads, as did the hair locks of the gorgoneion set in the centre of the aegis. Since there is no evidence that they were ever stylized into anything other than snakes' heads - griffins' heads, for example - the possibility that our protomes fringed the statue's aegis or even the gorgoneion is remote. There are, however, representations of helmets from the middle of the sixth century and later in which one or two griffin protomes are set on the brow of the helmet under the plume. Two appear in this position in a mid-sixth century representation of Athena on a vase from the Athenian Acropolis where the rest of the brow of the helmet is decorated with alternating lotuses and pomegranates, apparently thought of as in the round (fig. 15o).1 There is one on Penthesileia's helmet on Exekias' amphora in London.2 That protomes too could fringe the whole brow and not just the central peak is shown by the helmet of Neoptolemos on the Brygos Painter's Ilioupersis cup (fig. 15e) where they are of coiled snakes.3 Leaves are often found standing in this position, like the wreath on Athena's helmet on Athenian coins of the fifth and fourth centuries.4 The best-known later example is the helmet of Pheidias' Athena Parthenos on which we see, in the copies of it on the famous gold medallions in Leningrad5 (fig. 15c), alternate griffin and doe protomes, although later it is Pegasos protomes which are usually represented in this position.6 Griffins also appeared here inside the cheek-pieces,7 and further association of griffins with Athena's helmet is shown in Ionia by the coins of several Ionian states on which a griffin is seen engraved on the head-piece.8 Particular interest also attaches to the appearance of a row of griffin protomes on the diadem worn by a lady on one of the frescoes from Gordion,9 painted at the end of the sixth century by (Rumpf has suggested) a Chian artist. A single griffin protome decorates an East Greek gold diadem from Kelermes,10 and protomes appear on stephanai on red-figure vases.11 We seem then to be dealing with the decoration of an ornate or ceremonial helmet12 current from the middle of the sixth century.

The protomes might have fitted other styles of helmet but this seems the safest solution. Were the helmet * Ionian' with a central 'spur' the arrangement would be upset. Neither of the two helmets represented on Chian vases {JHS xliv (1924) 215 fig. 58: left, in Athens; right, in Cambridge) are canonical Ionian.

Restored in such a position on a helmet our griffin protomes would fit well, with the larger frontal one in the centre and the others, four on either side, with their heads slightly inclined to the front (fig. 15^). The Offerings. The history of a sanctuary is best told by the offerings found in it. In the publica- tion of the finds from the Athena Temple only considerations of the style, date and provenance of the objects will be found. The dating of some has already been cited in the account of the architectural history of the temple area, the association of others with the cult statue has been suggested, and it remains only to treat of them generically in their character of deliberate offer- ings to a particular deity. Many derived their value as offerings from the personal motives of the dedicator, which we can only guess, or from their intrinsic value rather than from being peculiarly appropriate to the shrine, and some are characteristic votive objects but not especially the perquisite of an Athena. The differences between the main classes of votives in the Athena Temple and those in the Harbour Sanctuary are also illuminating. The votives from the temple area fall naturally into the three main periods distinguished in the architectural account above. (a) Earliest Period. The clay figurines of this period which were dedicated in the temple are most of them the primitive type with wheel-made bodies which are found on other East Greek temple sites. Where enough of them is preserved to reveal their sex this is invariably female. That one of these might possibly be identified as an Athena has been remarked above, as has the presence of another with a plank-like torso like a primitive cult statue. The only animal figurine is apparently of a calf, an understandable offering in a rural community. The feminine or at least domestic side of the cult is further illustrated by the whorls, fibulae, knives and spits which were found, if the last two be not temple equipment or a form of currency. The sea-shells found with the earlier deposit are dedications also;3 the type is murex trunculus, source of the precious purple dye, and we may recall that, according to Phylarchos, Alexander wrote to all the Ionian cities, and particularly the Chian, asking them to send him 'purple'.4 The warlike character of the goddess may well be reflected in other offerings, which include arrows and a spear (their heads only, of course, are preserved) . Of particular interest in this context is a number of clay votive shields of a type found in both sanctuaries and tombs all over the Greek world. They are especially appropriate for a warrior goddess or as the dedica- tions of warriors, and recur in Athena sanctuaries in Athens, Aegina and Italy.5 Apart from some Greco-Egyptian faience gew-gaws and a miniature double-axe from a pendant most of the other votive material is pottery, and this often of the highest quality though very poorly preserved. Of the simpler, early pottery the common shapes are the plain one-handled jugs like those found in many of the houses, and small decorated vases, rarely larger ones like dinoi or craters. Cups are the most common, but by about 600 b.c., when Chian decorated vases were winning considerable popularity abroad, the significance of the pottery votives lay rather in their decorative merit than in their shape. Of those deliberately made for dedication there may be mentioned the Athena plate discussed above, and two cups (perhaps both chalices) with dedicatory inscriptions, one naming the deity. Phialai mesomphaloi in clay 1 Furtwängler thought they might (FR i 121 f.), and cf. Lorimer, op. cit., 239 f. 2 Cook, CVA British Museum viii 15 f. The uraeus seems indicated in BSA xxiv (1919-21) pl. iod, and compare Akr. 2509 (Graef-Langlotz, pl. 103). 3 They are common in archaic sanctuaries, cf.

Most of the dedications are of Chian origin, a point of some note in view of the fact that this period takes us down through the first half of the sixth century when Corinthian and Attic pottery was already common on eastern Aegean sites. It is also in significant contrast with the imports found in the Harbour Sanctuary at Emporio, notably the seventh-century Cypriot figurines and the sixth-century vases. The only certainly imported offerings are the faience figurines, perhaps from Egypt, fragments from an Ionian cup, perhaps from Samos, and from three Corinthian vases. Absent from the votives, but common in the Harbour Sanctuary are bronze belts (perhaps worn by women) and figurines of men and animals (but for one). As most of the votives had been removed from their original positions when the temple was built details of their find-places are of little interest here. It was, however, noted that objects of the same class tended to be found together, even though they had been swept away in an ap- parently haphazard manner. This applies particularly to the shields and the jugs, and we may deduce that these were kept together, and so thrown out together, in the sanctuary which pre- ceded the temple. (b) Temple Period. The offerings fall into two groups : those of the first half-century of the temple's existence, and others dating from the early fifth century to the middle of the fourth. The earlier are by far the richer. Two statuettes, one of marble, the other of limestone, represent korai of the same general type as those from the Athenian acropolis, who were also dedicated to Athena. In them we need see neither a representation of the goddess nor of the dedicator, but rather attendants presented to serve the goddess by adorning her house. To this period also belong the lead griffin protomes which have been described already. Cups, mainly chalices, are still the most common vases dedicated. Imports remain few : fragments of an Attic black- figured cup, and of East Greek figures and figure-vases, which were by now a commonplace on eastern sites. Later the offerings are poor in quality though plentiful. The figurines include standing and seated women as well as protomes. Their like is met all over Greece and recur as often in tombs or houses as in temples.2 They have no particular associations with Athena except in so far as she is a woman served by women ; they certainly have no bearing on her warlike character which is not reflected at all in these later dedications, an omission which, as already noted, may be the result of the goddess's change in status from town guardian within the acropolis to that of an extra-mural deity in a more remote centre of occupation. Other figurines of dancers, youths and animals have no particular votive significance. A miniature bronze phiale mesomphalos is a ritual shape whose occurrence in clay has been noted above. Among the vases dedicated plain Chian chalices and cups are still found. Thymiateria, with high conical stems and pierced lids are found in some numbers, and these are the only objects which, as well as being dedications, certainly could also have fulfilled a ritual function. Of the thirteen clay lamps recovered most were miniatures, though no less serviceable for that. The numbers found in the sanctuary of Athena Lindia led Blinkenberg3 to assume that they served to illuminate night rituals (TrocvvvxíÔes), which also might be the explanation of their presence here;4 many, even among the miniatures, certainly bear signs of having been used, so they can- not be regarded simply as votive replicas of domestic objects. The one loom- weight might be an 1 On these see Luschey in RE Suppl. vii, s.v. OiáÂri for references. An exceptional use for them is discussed by Dunbabin in BSA xlvi (1951) 63 ff. 2 Cf.

An unusually large number of fragments of wine-jars dating from the mid-fifth to beyond the mid-fourth century was found both within the temple and in the terrace fill outside, and in both places closely associated with votive material. Were there any signs of occupation near by we might suppose that the temple ministers kept their cellar (or at least their water) in the temple rather than in their houses, but the lack of it suggests that the jars with their original contents were votive. The practice of dedication of first-fruits is common to almost all religions in all periods; that the first jar sealed in the vintage season should be treated in the same way as the first sheaf or the first loaf is not surprising in an island whose major claim to fame, after Homer, was its wine, and in a part of the island whose wine was particularly celebrated. The practice is, however, not one that is much recorded,1 though in a Hellenistic dedicatory epigram in the Greek Anthology (vi 44) one Hermonax dedicates to Bacchos and the Satyrs three jars oïvou TrpcoTOxOroio, the irpcÓTris 6páyiicrra (pvTccÀifjs. One fragment of wine jar found outside the temple bore a painted inscription of which only two letters are preserved; it is possible that it was deliberately made as a dedication since the letters are not on the neck of the vase where single letters or symbols are sometimes found on Chian wine-jars. Many of the offerings of this period had been disturbed by the reconstruction work in the temple, and some were stacked behind Altar A in the corner of the cella which was to be cov- ered. The undisturbed offerings, terracottas and vases lay for the most part in the corners of the cella or were generally scattered at the western end. Those found in the fill which further raised the terrace in the east may be sweepings of the temple period but its irregular floor seems never to have been systematically cleared of the earth and broken votives which accumulated upon it. (c) Reconstruction Period. The only votives certainly attributable to this period are clay goblet-shaped vases of the type which has been called kernos. Kernoi have literary authority for being regarded as cult vessels in Demeter/Cybele sanctuaries2 but their presence here could give no grounds for the belief that there was a change in cult and it may be well to discuss briefly the association of this word and vase shape. There is some reason to believe that the word should be applied to the Eleusinian vases, like AM xxiii (1898) pl. 13, with their stemmed feet and clus- ters of small vases around and below the lip of the vase ; even so a confusion with thymiateria is apparent (ibid. pl. 13, 8a-b). With these (and there are other examples from Eleusis and the Athenian Eleusinion)3 the association of the simpler vases of the type from our temple is clear.4 However, the multiple character of the larger vases with their small separate containers for different types of solid or liquid offering is lost in the simpler variety, and with it we may suspect that their particular ritual significance and connection with Demeter may have been lost also. At this point the type of ring vase with miniature vases set on it5 may be called into the argument, as at least preserving one of the original purposes of the kernos, as it is recorded in Athenaios (xi 476e, 478e), as well as being certainly easier to carry on the head for a kernophoros.6 1 Blinkenberg (op. cit., 41) thought that the amphorae found in the Athena Lindia sanctuary were evidence of the feasts held there. 2 Lengthy discussions appear in AM xxiii (1898) 271 fF. (Rubensohn), RE, s.v. 'Kernos' (Leonard), and cf. Nilsson, Geschichte2! 118. 3 Eleusis, AE 1885 pl. 9.5-9; Athens, Thompson, Hesp iii (1934) 447-5°&gt; and cf. Hesp vi (1937) 208, viii (1939) 208 f., xxiii (iq^a.) 101 f. 4 Thompson, op. cit. The simpler Attic type has incurving walls above the handle zone, but its similarity to the Ghian vases is too great to be ignored. 5 Blinkenberg, op. cit., 331 f., and cf. P. E. Corbett, Hesp xviii (1949) 316 f. There are sixth-century Ghian examples from Naukratis, e.g. JHS xliv (1924) 217 fig. 62, pl. 6.29; CVA Oxford ii pl. 396.59. 6 That the other type of stemmed vase discussed here was thus carried is shown on the Ninnion plaque from Eleusis; cf. Rubensohn, op. cit., 295 for the relevant detail.</page><page sequence="46">THE MEGARON HALL 31 As the miniature vases are usually hydriai or kotylai both solid and liquid offerings could be accommodated, and, depending on whether their bases were pierced or not, they might be mixed together or kept separate. But although such vessels may fulfil the functions of a kernos quite well their origin can be traced back to the Bronze Age1 and in archaic and classical Greece they certainly do not appear only in Demeter sanctuaries. However, as the idea of mixing may be fundamental to the kernos, and the word itself perhaps derived from root forms of words like KspóvvuiJii, Kipváco,2 it cannot be completely ruled out that ritual ring vases were called kernoi when employed in the cult of Demeter. Finds in Chios town may throw light on the rela- tions and significance of this vase shape, at least in the island. A fourth-century and Hellenistic deposit from a Demeter sanctuary, which is identified by an inscription, yielded hundreds of fragments of ring vases with miniature hydriai on them but, so far as I know, none of the type of stemmed vase found in the Athena Temple.3 One of this type was, however, recovered in material from graves in Chios town. In Chios at least vases of this shape seem best regarded as ritual vases fit for offering in graves or temples, whatever the deity, and therefore the compro- mising name kernoi is avoided here and 'goblets' preferred. See below, p. 175. Most of the fragments of this type of vase were found in the surface level in the north-western corner of the cella, that is, above the enlarged offering table there. 5. THE MEGARON HALL Flanking the acropolis wall and facing the main entrance to the circuit stood a long rectan- gular building, the Megaron Hall (fig. 16; plate ja-c). Before excavation the line of its walls was visible, and had in fact been even more clearly defined by modern rubble additions above them. Most of the fallen stones in the interior had also been removed, and the ring of a charcoal- burner's pit in the centre of the building explained the modern additions to the walls which had served as a temporary shelter. Most of the wall at the back of the porch had been rebuilt in this way, and when some of it had been removed to reveal the original threshold it was clear that only the foundation stones in the walls flanking it could belong to the original building. Not all the modern rubble additions here have been removed as they serve to define more clearly the outlines of the ancient building. Its overall length is 18.25 m-l ^ts width is 6.40 m. at the north and 6.85 m. at the south, so it was not a completely regular building. It was entered from the south, the direction of the acropolis gateway, through a shallow (2.50 m.) porch with two columns in antis. A single door stood slightly off-centre in the porch wall and gave access to the main hall in which no further divisions were observed. Three columns stood in line in the centre of the building. The length of the eastern anta of the porch was fortunately preserved by its southern founda- tion stone which remains in position. Of the western anta all preserved are two large foundation slabs which represent its approximate original length. Only one of the porch column bases remains in situ. This is a roughly shaped block, 0.30-40 m. deep and approximately 0.70 m. in diameter, with a circle on its surface, 0.60 m. in diameter, dressed smooth to hold the wooden column which must have stood upon it. The base is supported above the irregular bedrock 1 Nilsson, The Minoan- Mycenaean Religion2 1 35 ff. 2 Schol. Nik.

Of the second porch column only a few stones immediately above the rock may once have helped support its base. The line of the porch wall is indicated by its foundations which lie to a depth of 0.75 m. below the top of the threshold. They are 0.60 m. thick and constructed of fairly compact, undressed stones; neither side is lined exactly at right-angles to the side walls of the building. The threshold block measures 1.60x0.45x0.40 m. (high). Its sides and base are irregular but its top was worked smooth and shows little sign of wear; it lies 0.20 m. higher than the top of the porch column base. The rock has been cut back to receive the foundations of the east wall, and the ground level at the east must have been some 0.50 m. higher than the floor inside the building. The founda- tions are of immense stones, particularly in the south; they are roughly faced both below and where they project above the presumed floor level. Above them on the interior are smaller stones, quarry-faced and well-fitted, but with no pretensions to being polygonal masonry rather than good rubble. The walls of the building must have been built of stone in similar fashion to their tops. There is no suggestion here, or indeed anywhere on the site, of a low stone socle to carry an upper part of mudbrick, and in this area building-stone was much more readily accessible than clay. The wall thickness varies considerably, from 1.00 m. by the north-east corner to 0.60 m. by the porch, but, as the ground level here is higher than the floor within, relatively little is preserved in height to give an idea of the appearance of the exterior masonry. Opposite the porch wall a short line of foundation stones projects up to 0.30 m. beyond the face of the wall above. The rear (north) wall of the Megaron Hall was about 0.65 m. thick and is preserved a full ' m. above the presumed floor level. A narrow trench against its outer face revealed its founda- tion stones which continue down to the rock and project slightly from the wall-line above them (plate y a). The north-east corner is preserved clearly but the corner stones at the west are lost. The line of the west wall is not easy to distinguish as it overlies the lower stones of the acropolis wall, but much of its inner face is approximately in position to a height of ' m. and the position of its outer face can be picked up here and there. This is confirmed by the position of the two great slabs which form the foundation of the western anta of the porch. As the west thus lies over the inner part of the thickness of the main acropolis wall it is impossible that the latter stood to any great height at this point. It may here have become no more than a slightly raised narrow walk, barely 1 m. wide in places, around the outer wall of the building. The excavation of the interior of the building was disappointing. Much of the floor had been disturbed down to the level of the rock by the charcoal burners,1 and in the few places where the fill of the floor was clearly undisturbed it consisted of the familiar white powdered rock and contained no ancient pottery. At no point could the original floor level be accurately determined and the level of the top of the threshold was higher than most of the surface within before excavation. In two or three places the projecting bedrock had been cut back to floor level, or slightly below it. Of the column bases within only one was found in situ in the northern part of the building (plate yc). This resembles closely the column base in the porch, being 0.45 m. high and approximately 0.50 m. in diameter on its smoothed surface. Its sides and base are roughly shaped. Its top lies 0.20 m. higher than the level of the nearby rock which had been cut back, and than the threshold. Evidence for a second column is afforded by an outcrop of the bedrock 3.0 m. away which had been partially dressed smooth. The fact that only part of it was cut back in this way shows that it was not the general levelling for the floor, and it is at any 1 Their pit filled the width of the building. A few stones lay at its periphery and it contained much burnt matter and scraps of charcoal as well as part of a modern painted water jug.</page><page sequence="49">34 GREEK EMPORIO rate lower than both the dressed rock nearby and the top of the preserved column base. Its alignment with this base and its central position in the building show it to be a cutting for a second column base, no doubt shallower than the other as the rock lay nearer the floor at this point. The base itself is missing as it lay within the circle of the charcoal-burner's pit which had disturbed everything down to bedrock. With two columns in these positions a third, of which no trace was found in the excavation, can confidently be restored to the south to complete the number of interior roof supports. A displaced column base was found beneath a pile of loose stones in the north-west corner of the building. It resembles the base in situ and measures 0.25-30 m. in height, and 0.50 m. in diameter. It might be from the centre of the building. The line of these columns was parallel to the side walls ; it was not exactly on the central long axis, but slightly displaced to the west, as is the threshold and doorway. The column shafts must have been of wood, and the roof they supported may have been a flat earth roof, pitched perhaps in one direction, or a gabled thatch. This is a problem best discussed with the houses in the town on the slopes of the hill where there are similar, though smaller megaron-houses (Section 6). These also face south and have their west walls overlying a terrace wall, just as the Megaron Hall overlaps the acropolis wall. These too are better preserved and can give a better idea of the type of masonry employed. The Hall stood in a commanding position on the saddle of the hill. From its door one looked straight down through the acropolis gateway. To the left stands the temple and its altars; immediately below, the main road to the summit passes down towards the north, and below the road the houses of the town cling to the steep slope. In such a position the occupant of the Hall could command the entrance to his citadel, the attention of his patron goddess, the respect and submission of his people. Dating. But for part of a modern water jug in the charcoal-burner's pit the only pottery re- covered was a few worn sherds of plain vases and the foot of a sixth-century wine jar; one or two fragments bore the remains of a heavy cream slip and were clearly geometric or archaic. On the surface there were scraps of classical wine jars. In the town the megaron-houses seem to be the earliest; and the Megaron Hall should, from its association with the acropolis wall, belong also to the earliest period of the occupation of the site, certainly as early as the seventh century, perhaps even in the eighth. 6. THE TOWN The houses of the town on Prophètes Elias lie wholly outside the acropolis wall, to the west, overlooking the valley which runs down to Emporio harbour. The town was just out of sight of strangers arriving in the harbour, and was probably deliberately sited thus (cf. plate yd). Selective excavation of the houses and a detailed ground survey revealed what is probably the full extent of the occupation here and many details of the town plan (fig. 4) . In this section the roads, house architecture and general plan are discussed together with the evidence for dating. The main area of occupation lay below the road which leads to the acropolis entrance. Above it the outlines of only three houses were detected, and these all lie immediately beside the road itself. The slope between the road and the acropolis wall is so steep that it would have been impracticable to attempt construction here, even on the modest scale of the recognized houses. In an area of less than 40,000 sq.m. (about 10 acres) more than fifty houses were certainly</page><page sequence="50">THE TOWN 35 identified, and from the plan and nature of the ground it seems likely that this represents more than half, perhaps nearly all, of the buildings. There is also, however, some evidence for occupation in the archaic period outside the main area of the town, notably along the probable extension of the main road to the north, and on the lower slopes of the hill towards the harbour. This is represented by isolated stretches of walling and sherds. Pottery also indicates occupation on the lower slopes to the west of the town and on the knoll ioo m. east of the well. This, however, is of the Classical or Hellenistic period, long after the abandonment of the town and acropolis on the slopes above. Roads. The main road down from the acropolis can be traced for about ' km., as well as its probable continuation much farther inland down into the valley. Its effective width was about 2 m., and although the rock was at no point trimmed to afford a level surface there had clearly been some moving of boulders and rough filling of cavities. No true surface is preserved at any place and it can only have been of trodden earth over the rock. The lower, west side of the road was supported by short stretches of terrace wall at several points. These were crudely constructed and are nowhere preserved over i m. high. There were rare signs of similar terracing against the slope on the upper side of the road. The town was traversed by at least four main paths which follow the contours of the hill. These are also terraced at some points, particularly near the Lower Megaron and House A. Most of the houses lie along these paths with their terraces defining the paths5 upper edge. There must also have been several stepped paths up the slope but the positions of only few of these have been satisfactorily established. The extremely difficult nature of the ground today, with almost all the original surface washed away and covered by boulders which have rolled down from above, makes the identification of paths even more difficult than that of houses. At one point, by House J, careful excavation showed the way in which smaller stones had been packed into cavities to form a foundation for the north-south path, as well as for a subsidiary one running along the south wall of the house. The immediate means of approach to the houses could not always be determined. In the bench-house A and House J a short inclined ramp led up from one of the north-south paths to the door. The Lower Megaron was reached by a short flight of steps against its terrace wall which led onto the area before its porch. The common cporch' of Houses U and V opened straight onto the path, but there was most probably a step also. The possible continuation of the most westerly path, towards the harbour and past the well, is shown in fig. 3. Megaron-Houses and the Megaron Hall. The houses are readily divided into two main classes, here called megaron-houses and bench-houses. For detailed descriptions the reader is referred to the next section; here their main features and architectural significance, contents and date are discussed. The characteristics of the Emporio megara are easily summarized. All face south. All have two columns in the porch and a central doorway into the single main room. House I had a partially enclosed porch sheltering what may be a pithos stand in one corner, but this arrange- ment might belong to a late period of reoccupation. The arrangement of the interior columns is clear only in the Lower Megaron and the Megaron Hall, where there were two and three columns in line down the centre. In House I there may have been only one inner column. Unlike most of those in the bench-houses the column bases are broad and comparatively flat discs. Also the rock was dressed flat for the floors and not left rough. The masonry is generally more sophisticated, notably in the Lower Megaron, and it is clear that no mudbrick was used D</page><page sequence="51">36 GREEK EMPORIO in the construction of the walls. In the Lower Megaron the straight curb for the central hearth is preserved.1 There is no conclusive evidence about the shape of the roofs. Tiles were not used and the layer of yellowish clay above many of the floors (cf. plate 8e and sections) can only represent the collapse of mud roofs, presumably supported on branches or cut timber. A flat roof, or one with a slight one-way pitch, is most probably to be restored : a form of construction still very common on the island (e.g., plate i i a, ¿), where sea- weed too is often used to seal and pad cracks beneath the packed mud.2 Mud roofs with a steep pitch are, however, practicable, as current practice in the Near East shows.3 No stone roof rollers were found. Much has been written about the shape of megaron roofs in the Bronze Age and Iron Age4 but no simple solution has been found and, except where house models or graffiti suggest the current practice on any one site, no solution is possible. The cmegaron' form plays an important part in the history of early architecture in the Aegean world.5 Homeric associations of the word have sometimes bedevilled discussion, and the term is often applied only to the Bronze Age plan in which the inner supports are often in two rows (not more than four columns) around the central hearth. Exception might then be taken to its use for the Iron Age temples and houses with a single central row of columns, like the Emporio houses,6 but the Bronze Age plan is not so rigidly defined that it need cause embarrassment to use the term later. However, a distinction between the Bronze Age and Iron Age forms needs to be drawn. In the Bronze Age the megaron was at home in mainland Greece (not Crete until LMIII) and in those parts of Anatolia which were originally most closely related to the civiliza- tion of mainland Greece : notably Troy.7 It is not otherwise met in the Near East.8 A form of the Bronze Age megaron survived in Anatolia at Gordion9 but there is no reason to believe that East Greek megara are influenced by Anatolian forms. They belong entirely to the development of the type in Greek lands and the plan may have been brought east by the Iron Age migrations. They have no clear links with the Bronze Age buildings; indeed there are no substantial architectural remains of the immediately post- Mycenaean period in Greece, and those in Crete throw no light on the development of the Iron Age megaron. Oval or apsidal plans seem generally to precede the rectangular megara of the geometric and early archaic temples and houses in Greece, and the development seems to be quite independent of any possible survivals of Bronze Age practice. The story of this development can be traced on the Greek mainland only in temple plans but Old Smyrna gives a valuable picture of the development in house architecture.10 The rectangular megara at Emporio and contemporary buildings at Old Smyrna are the earliest surviving examples of the plan in Greek domestic architecture. 1 Cf. the square hearth in the Temple of Herakles on Thasos, Études Thasiennes i 31 fig. 11, pl. 6.2.

The relationship between the megaron-houses and the bench-houses is exemplified by the complex formed by the Lower Megaron and House A. Here the main terrace was clearly designed to carry only the megaron, with perhaps an outbuilding or yard behind, and the bench-house is an addition. Moreover, part of the south wall of the bench-house is formed by the rear wall of the megaron, and some stones removed from the latter's north-east corner in the course of the later building were replaced by a patch of small stones (plate 8d). This may have been occasioned by the removal of a continuation northwards of the east wall of the meg- aron. Finally, pottery was found beneath the floor of the bench-house suggesting its late appear- ance in the history of the occupation of this area. The bench-houses are obviously much poorer dwellings than the megara but this evidence suggests that they may also be later. The bench-houses have no porches, and their doors may face north or south. In plan they are roughly square and the roof supports, from one to four in number, are set irregularly. This surely indicates a flat mud roof or perhaps a slight one-way pitch. The clayey level representing the collapse of the roof was noted in several houses. The walls are all stone, and only the masonry of House A compares at all favourably with that of the megara. This house also enjoyed the added amenity of a west door leading to a small paved terrace overlooking the path. The rock was not dressed flat for the floor, which in some houses was extremely irregular (cf. plate ga). The column bases were narrower than those of the megara, and either flat discs or narrow cylinders. In House A there is also a stone drum of a column in position on a disc base, but the rest of it must have been wooden like the others. The characteristic stone 'benches' appear in Houses A, E and C. They are built against the rear (upper, eastern) wall of the house, and those in Houses A and C are preserved to their full height. They must have served as sleeping platforms like the wooden pataria in many Greek peasant homes today.1 Small, stone-built hearths are found in the corners of Houses V and C, and in a partially exposed house outside the town to the south-west. They may have had brick superstructures of some sort.2 Close parallels for this type of humble architecture are hardly to be sought, but on Andros the geometric houses are similar, and on Siphnos they have sleeping benches.3 A Protogeo- metric B house model from a tomb near Knossos is square in plan with a bench at the back opposite the door.4 Houses U and V defy classification. Their common porch may emulate the megara, but the hearth in V is as in the bench-houses. The column shafts in all the houses must have been wooden. Stone thresholds were found in most of the houses but no detailed evidence for the door construction. There was presumably a wooden frame resting on the threshold, as in many present-day cottages. House A was the finest of the bench-houses with its second door leading on to a paved area looking over the main path. This should have been the village kapheneion. The Finds. The town was peaceably abandoned. Very few minor objects were overlooked so the only finds were of broken pottery or of objects of no further use. The pottery was all in a very poor condition, and only rarely were any traces of paint or slip preserved. Of the pieces found on the floors of the houses none was later than the seventh century in date. The distinctive shapes were craters, and scraps of early chalice, types familiar in the Harbour Sanctuary. 1 E.g., A. G.

The only other objects were the spindle whorls, also matched in the Athena Temple, from House I. Here some later pottery and part of an iron axe in the upper fill may indicate reoccupation at a much later date. 'Chimneys* and Wells. Fragmentary clay objects resembling the tops of pithoi were found on the floors of Houses A and C, and in the debris of other houses. There was also a fragment from a Period I deposit south of the terrace in front of the Athena Temple (fig. 17c). The examples from the Lower Megaron and House C could be completely restored in drawing, * see fig. i 7 a, b. The other examples are of exactly this type, and, within a centimetre or two, of this size. The projecting rim is like that of a pithos, but below it the walls continue straight and then end abruptly without any base or foot moulding. Half way up the side there is a horizontal band of three incised lines. It is quite clear from the many fragments found that the lower walls of these objects were not pierced by holes or fenestrations but formed a continuous hoop. On the inside there projects a narrow ledge and the walls are pierced by small holes cut at an angle immediately above this ledge. The tops of pithoi were often used as well-heads and clay cylinders very similar in appearance to the finds in the houses here appear in seventh- to fifth-century contexts in Athens.2 How- ever, none of these has the interior ledge, and all are pierced by two large holes just below the rim which may have been used for lifting. Moreover, no wells have been found in the main area of the Prophètes Elias town, and it seems very doubtful whether it would ever have been practicable to dig one so high on such a steep slope. Again, all the fragments were found within houses and although their surface is very badly weathered there were no signs of the sort of wear one would expect with well-heads. Much lower on the hill-slopes wells are possible and one or two very deep ones are in use today. The rectangular well discovered below and to the south of the town will be described on p. 40. The only reasonable alternative explanation for the clay objects in the houses is that they are chimneys. Hearths or braziers they can hardly be, for the ledge could not support a pot and there was no provision for air to reach the fire. The ledge must have supported a moveable cap of some sort which may have been fastened (it is not clear how) through the holes above it; unless these were to serve in some way to hold the chimney firm on the roof. Chimneys have rarely been reported on Greek sites;3 they might, indeed, not readily be recognized. In the circumstances there can be no certainty in the identification of these objects, but the variety of broken jars or ancient wine-amphorae which serve as chimney-pots in many Chian houses today lends some plausibility to the suggestion.4 It will be noted that the fragments were found both in bench-houses and in one megaron- house. If they are chimneys they might be used as further evidence that the roofs were flat on the megara also.

This may have been one of the most important sources of water for the townfolk. Its walls are stone-built, rough polygonal (plate lof) ; the inner measurements are 2.87 x 1.07. It was dug to 7.20, when ground water was reached. In the fill were fragments of seventh-century pottery, mainly from craters and amphorae. Similar rectangular well shafts of comparable antiquity have been found in Athens and Kameiros.1 Chronology and Conclusion. The houses were abandoned by the end of the seventh century. We do not know when the earliest was built, but the stratigraphy and architecture of the complex formed by the Lower Megaron and House A suggest that the megaron form is earlier than that of the bench-houses. The earliest finds in the Athena Temple are of the later eighth century and it seems reasonable to assume that the earliest of the houses in the town were standing at that time. As an illustration of an early Greek community the town on Prophètes Elias is unique. It was not large; there were perhaps no more than 500 souls in the main area of the town though there may have been other houses in the valley or by the harbour in positions at once more convenient and more vulnerable. There is no evidence that the harbour area was in any way a centre of occupation in the main period of the town on Prophètes Elias. But the sanctuary there must have attracted more and more of the population to its vicinity as conditions became more settled until by the end of the seventh century the hill-side town was completely abandoned. The architectural interest of the town plan is slight. It is entirely dictated by the ground and the steep slope. It could well have resembled closely many Greek villages of today with their haphazard roads, paths and probably only one thoroughfare for wheeled traffic.2 This sort of architecture and plan is timeless. The completeness of the plan lends it its especial importance. Not only is the full extent of the occupied area clear, but also its relationship to the fortifications, 'governor's residence', sanctuary and water supply. It is even possible to draw conclusions about the social and political organization of the community with more assurance than can usually be expressed for purely archaeological evidence. No other early Greek town is so completely known; none other so small, it should be admitted, has been thoroughly explored or has offered such ready results. Its early abandonment was particularly fortunate. 7. DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES The Lower Megaron and House A (figs. 18, 19; plates 8, 9 a-c). These two houses lay side by side on a terrace above the most important of the north-south paths in the town. The path itself is some 3.5 wide by the northern end of the terrace, where the line of boulders supporting its outer edge is still clear. The terrace on which the house stood is built largely of unworked boulders and stones, and stands between 1 and 2 m. high along its whole length. Access to the area before the megaron is provided by a stairway alongside the terrace wall. Four slab steps, c. 0.70 wide, are preserved. At this point the path is barely 2 m. wide. Where the terrace runs straight, below the west wall of the megaron, it is founded on bedrock and is 1.80 thick at its base. It supports an artificial fill of earth and stone chips beneath the megaron floor. To the north it swings out in a curve, returning sharply towards the door of House A. The massive fill of stones here supports a nearly semicircular area west of House A. 1 The Rectangular Rock-cut Shaft, Hesp vii (1938) 363 ff. ; for the Kameiros shaft see Higgins, i 23. 2 The village at Karphi in Crete, dating to LMIIIC and later, suggested to the excavators some telling parallels with more recent architecture which they discuss and illus- trate in BSA xxxviii (1937-8) 66-68.</page><page sequence="56">" ^ THRESH0LDA/VTV ^^ V' ' lt''Ì ~""J</page><page sequence="57">&lt; - ' ' HOUSE A AND LOWI 3 ^'" FIG. 1 8</page><page sequence="58">AND LOWER MEGARON</page><page sequence="59">DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES 41 The original surface is shown by the scraps of paving close to the wall of the house, and it seems likely that the whole area served as a sort of platform or verandah overlooking the road. There was access to House A through a door. The floor of the megaron, represented by a hard grey level of trodden earth, overlays the terrace fill and, to the east, the rock which had been cut back for it.

A little of the back, north wall is left, with large stones on the outside, smaller within, roughly quarry-faced. The outer north-east corner had been rebuilt when House A was added to the complex. The east wall, 0.60 thick, was founded on rock, partly cut back for it, and stands about 1.5 high for most of its length. It is of quarry-faced stones, quite carefully set. The front</page><page sequence="60">42 GREEK EMPORIO of the building is poorly preserved. Of the rear wall of the porch, 0.45 thick, there are a few stones north of the doorway, some foundations south of it and, between, small stones beneath the position for the threshold. The end of the east wall of the house is clearly defined. In line with it the eastern base of the porch columns is in situ, a rough cylinder 0.50 high and 0.45 across. A similar second base was found displaced to the south-west. Inside the megaron are two stone disc bases in line down the centre. They are 0.65 and 0.58 across and 0.20 m. deep. They stand almost exactly along the axis, with their centres 3.5 in from the lines of the outer walls. In front of the rear base a thin slab, 1.45 long, was set on its edge, with its top just above the top of the column base. This might well have been the curb of a central hearth. At its east end are the fragments of what seems to have been another disc column base, 0.75 across. It had presumably been rejected or replaced by one of the others, and could have served as something like a pot-stand. There were two other isolated paving stones in the south-east corner of the room. Over the floor along the east half of the room was a thick level of hard yellow clay, which probably represents the fall of a clay roof. Above is the debris of the upper part of the east wall and of buildings higher up the slope. The overall dimensions of the whole megaron are 10.5 x 7.0; the inner dimensions of the main room, 10.30-9.70 xc. 5.70. There were no finds or pottery from beneath the floor. On the floor was a near-complete clay 'chimney' near the hearth (fig. 1 7 a), the neck of a hydria and the lower part of a one-handled pitcher. House A was built at the back of the megaron. That it is a late construction is shown by the presence of pottery beneath its floor, suggesting that the megaron, where nothing was found beneath the floor, was already standing and in use, and by the junction of its walls with the megaron. House A is of irregular shape, its outer dimensions being 6.6o(N) x 6.6o(E) x 7.o(S) x 7.o(W). Its walls are 0.50 thick, except for the back wall (up the slope to the east) which is 0.60. They are constructed much as the megaron walls but here and there the inside is built up of smaller slab- like stones laid horizontally. Part of the south wall is of course the back wall of the megaron. Its north-east outer corner stones seem to have been pulled out when House A was built. It may even be that the east wall of the megaron had once continued to the north behind the building. The corner is patched with small stones, shown in plate 8d, seen from the inside of House A. At the east a sleeping platform is built of well-fitted quarry-faced stones. It is pre- served to its full height above the irregular floor (1.20 where the floor is deepest) and its flat top is broken only by the rock which projects above it at the centre and to the south against the back wall of the house. The main door, 1 m. wide, opens through the north wall onto the path outside. There is no threshold block but the wall line is built up with small stones above the rock to the level of the floor within the room, and there was probably a threshold above this. Another door, with a stone threshold 1.20 wide, opened in the west wall onto the paved area overlooking the path. In the western half of the house the floor is represented by a distinct brown level of trodden earth. Below it is a level of tight-packed white chips and rock dust, possibly from the building operations, and beneath this ordinary soil and stones. In the rest of the room the bedrock crops high above this floor level, the highest point being in the south-east corner against the sleeping platform. There are four column bases in the room. The northern pair are roughly cylindrical, the south-western is flatter and supported on the rock by small stones, the south-eastern, against the sleeping platform, has a similar disc base and above it a tall (0.65) roughly conical column drum. The floor was covered with a thick level of yellow clay, probably from the roof, above which was the debris of stones and earth.</page><page sequence="61">DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES 43 From beneath the floor came fragments of a clay 'chimney' and of cups, some with traces of slip and paint. On the floor near the south-east column base was a trefoil-lipped jug, and in the debris above scraps of fine-walled cups and of a clay 'chimney'. Among the surface stones was a sixth-century amphora foot. House C (fig. 20; plate 9 ¿/, e). A bench-house of classic type, nearly square in plan. The east wall continues south as a terrace wall. The walls (0.60 thick) are rather roughly built although here and there the inner faces have small stones quite well set. The deep threshold (0.32 x 0.30 deep) was in situ in the door, at the centre of the south wall. The rock is nearly level here (it may have been roughly cut back) and the floor built up with earth just over it. There was one column base (0.30 across and 0.25 deep) just off centre, set in a cavity in the rock. Along the east side of the room was a 'bench' sleeping platform 1 m. wide. It was not very high. Its supporting wall is made up with a line of stones at the north and centre levelled at the top to the original height of the platform, and a few small stones at the south where the edge of the platform runs up to the east jamb of the door. In the south-west corner of the room was a square hearth, like that in FAST HOUSE C ~^^&gt; SOUTH NORTH FIG. 2O House V, with two upright slabs in position (plate 90). In and around it was a mass of red clay and earth with particles of burnt matter. On the floor were parts of two coarse pitchers and of one early chalice, and several fragments of a 'chimney' (fig. 17Ä). In the upper debris was a fragment of an archaic crater rim. House E (fig. 21). This is one of the highest houses in the town, lying immediately below the main road at a point just before it turns in to the acropolis entrance. It stands on the edge of a terrace which marks the edge of a path running north to join the road. Another path runs above and behind the house towards House F. The arrangement of lines of stones around the house suggests a rough enclosure for it, but this is by no means certain. It is square, the outer dimension c. 6.50. The heavy east wall, against the slope, is 0.65 thick: the side walls 0.50-0.60 thick. The west wall lay over a massive terrace for at this point the hillside falls sharply away. On the east the rock is cut back for the floor, but the level drops a whole metre across the house, to the west. There are three column bases. One, on the rock, is slightly off centre. The other two are in line parallel to the south wall and 1.50 from it. They are 0.25 across. The eastern one sits on the rock and is 0.33 tall. The western is made of two 'drums', 0.18 and 0.36 high. The taller is bedded into the earth floor with loosely packed stones beneath it, on the rock. In the doorway in the north wall the threshold remains in position, though cracked in two.

The walls are slight (0.50 thick) except for the west wall (up to 0.90 thick) which had to retain the fill of the floor. Little of the original floor was preserved along the west side. To the east the rock cropped high above the floor level as in many of the bench-houses, but there was no sign of any arrangement like a 'bench'.

Inside the rock had been cut back for the floor in the east part of the room, but there were no other architectural features whatever. No pottery was found in the house, but fragments of a large plain one-handled cup were recovered immediately above it to the east. House I (figs. 24, 25; plate 10a). Megaron I lies south of the complex of House A and the Lower Megaron, and beside the same north-south path which serves them. The path is here 3.75 wide and is supported on its lower, western side by a very stout wall 1.50 thick (plate 10b). The west wall of the megaron itself seems to have been continued on to the north as a terrace above the road. South, along the path, some lines of stones may represent an arrangement of steps, but this is by no means clear. The overall dimensions of the megaron are 10.25x6.50. Its western wall, 1.30 thick, served HOUSE I ^r&lt;^Hß?oV^ WEST y^0 Jk EAST FIG. 25 as a terrace for the fill of earth and stones beneath the floor. It is preserved to about the level of the floor within the house but certainly would not have continued rising at this width. The other walls are 0.50-0.55 thick and are nowhere preserved more than 1 m. high. Bonded with mud they might have stood the full height of the house; at least, there is no trace of brick upperworks here or in other houses. The inner dimensions of the main room are 6.30 xc. 5.50. One small disc column base was found on the floor just off the centre line. The floor itself was of earth in the west but in the east the rock had been cut back for it and in places the cut rock face serves as the lower part of the east wall. The lower stones of the wall at the back of the porch are in position with a gap of 1.35 where the threshold stood. The eastern anta of the porch is carried round across the front of the house for nearly 2 m. (plate 10a). In the corner of the enclosed part of the porch is the lower part of a rough pier of stones which may have been a stand or perhaps a buttress for a collapsing wall. The west wall of the porch projects a little beyond the return of the east anta. One porch</page><page sequence="68">48 GREEK EMPORIO column base is in situ. It is a small cylinder, 0.35 high and 0.30 across.

We miss the clay level</page><page sequence="69">DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES 49 which has been taken elsewhere to represent the fall of the roof, but this may be because the house stood for some time after being abandoned, or was re-used. On the floor were fragments of a one-handled pitcher, two clay spindle whorls and a fragment from the rim of a crater - all of early archaic type. In the porch were fragments of a pithos of red clay and, above the floor, a fragment of a one-handler and of a black-glaze cup. In the upper fill was part of an iron axe. These may mean that the house was reoccupied in classical times and might account for the uncharacteristic nature of the debris over the floor which has been noted already. If so, the unusual features of the porch might also be attributed to a late period, when the house was being used as a wood-cutter's hut. No distinct floor level for the later occu- pation was observed although it may be represented by the top of the hard sandy level over the original floor. House 0 (fig. 26). This is approximately 5.20 square. The walls are slight, between 0.45 and 0.55 thick, and the east wall stands 1.30 high still. The north-east corner of the house has been broken down by a heavy fall of rock. The bedrock was cut back for the floor, which is nearly level, and covered only lightly with the earth fill of the floor. Near the centre is a low cylindrical column base, 0.35 across and 0.15 high. Only one scrap of pottery was found in the debris. Houses U and V (fig. 27; plate 10 c-e). The two houses lie above the northward continuation of the path which runs past House A and the Lower Megaron. House V is a variety of the usual bench-house; House U offers an unusual plan with two rooms of equal size. The houses face each other across a triangular space or yard, limited at its open side by a line of stones which may represent a step down towards the main path. There were two displaced stone discs in the northern half of this area. If they are not from the interior of one of the houses they might indi- cate that there was some sort of covered lean-to which served as a joint porch for both buildings. House V is roughly rectangular - 5-3o(E) x4«2o(S) X5.io(W) X3«75(N). The rock was considerably cut back for both the east and south walls. The stones of the south wall are for the most part missing and only the lowest stones of the terrace-foundation of the west wall are in position. The natural slope is very steep here and the outer, western part of the house has been carried away. The walls are about 0.60 thick and rather carelessly built of large stones. The east wall is preserved to 1.30 high. The floor was rock (in the east) and earth. Near the north-east corner is a small hearth (plate loe) with upright coping stones in position on three sides. These are 0.30 high; the hearth 0.65 across. It was full of dark red earth and clay. Near the centre of the room is a low cylindrical column base, 0.30 across and 0.20 high, bedded on small stones on the rock. A group of stones in the south-east corner might be part of a sleeping platform. Above the floor was a layer of thick yellow clay. This may be the fallen roof but it should be noted that the red deposit from the hearth spilled forward on top of it. The amount of the red clay deposit in, over and beside the hearth suggests that it is rather from some mud- brick superstructure to the hearth than an ordinary accumulation of burnt matter. The only finds in House V were fragments of red pithos and plain vases, without any parts of their feet or lips. House U is roughly rectangular - 6.35(E) x 5.25(8) X5-35(W) x5«o(N). Its outer walls are somewhat heavier than those of House V and far better constructed. The west wall spread towards its foundations to terrace up the earth fill of the floor for which, in the eastern half, the rock has been trimmed back. The east wall, against the slope, stands 1.50 high at one point. A gap in the south wall makes the door but the threshold is missing. The house is divided into two by a cross wall, only 0.45 wide, well constructed of small stones. It is noteworthy, however, that above a line 0.50 above the rock floor at the east end its construction changes to one of</page><page sequence="70">50 GREEK EMPORIO I ^ 'L / ì / n' / ' ii ^^ i i/« p» ' / i i ^s i i c F? il / - I ^-^ / * HCjII^K ii ^^ i/« p» ' V / i H i C/ ^s UStl i i c U / cDv s / ' ^^ ^ EAST * IM* ^^„-u NORTH _- - SOUTH %, ^^„-u NORTH _- - EjJ* ^ ""^ vs. EAST ^'&lt;ii(^^^«^^^^^^^'s&gt;WEST FIG. 27</page><page sequence="71">DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES 51 larger, well-set stones ; and the main west wall of the house, to the north of this point, shows a similar change in construction at this level for over 1 ' m. Here the upper stones are laid almost like ashlars (plate i oc). There is no doorway into this inner room so we must assume that it was a store-room, entered from above, and that there may have been a second story at least over this part of the house. In the outer, southern, room a small stone disc, 0.25 across, could have served as a base for a wooden post. The usual deposit of thick yellow clay was absent over the floors of both rooms. On the floor were fragments from at least three plain pitchers of the usual archaic type, from plain amphorae, from a small trefoil-mouthed jug and a larger oenochoe, and part of the body and shallow splaying foot of what may be an early chalice with slight traces of paint upon them. E</page><page sequence="72">CHAPTER 2. THE HARBOUR SANCTUARY 1. THE SANCTUARY TERRACES The presence of a sanctuary of the archaic Greek period in the neighbourhood of the harbour at Emporio was suspected in 1954 after three unlooked-for discoveries (plate i ic). An explora- tory trench on the outskirts of the main area of the prehistoric excavations came upon a pit with sixth-century and earlier votives and pottery, including a signed chalice (plate 34, 251), and the back of a substantial wall. This trench was later enlarged as A in fig. 28.

The foundations of the apse itself were also seen to include architectural members from an earlier Greek building. Thirdly, a pit dug for domestic purposes beside the later Trench J in fig. 28 yielded finely decorated archaic and classical pottery. In 1955 a</page><page sequence="73">THE SANCTUARY TERRACES 53 systematic exploration of the area bounded by these three points led to the discovery of a series of archaic terraces, raised to support sanctuary buildings, of which all that survived were the foundations already mentioned. It was not possible to complete the excavation of this complex, but the outlines of the plan of the terraces and their chronology were satisfactorily established. The main area of the excavation (F, G, H in fig. 28) was in a field limited on the east by a stony path beyond which lay the centre of the excavation in the Early Bronze Age town. Above the south-east corner of the field is a sprawling heap of small stones, probably from the walls of the prehistoric buildings and cleared from the surface of the fields in recent times. B and C were dug in this heap. Above a terrace wall to the south lies the field containing the Early Christian Basilica Church as well as the foundations of the fifth-century b.c. temple. To the north there is but one field's breadth before the pebbly beach and the harbour. The long section in H (fig. 30) tells the complete story of the stratigraphy of the terraces. In the following account this section is described, together with the relevant levels in other areas, in chronological order beginning with the levels of the earliest period. There follows a description of other features appearing in the trenches and considerations of chronology. The end of each main period is marked by the construction of a new terrace wall, and the duration of each period is represented by the contents of the fill behind the new wall. Each wall is described with the period which preceded its construction; that is, with the period of the contents of its fill, not of its use. Period I This is represented only in the main section in H (fig. 30) . Above virgin soil is a level (27, with 26) of packed earth and pebbles, between 0.20 and 0.40 m. thick. It rises gradually to the south, away from the harbour, but does not present any flat or prepared surface; and as well as its marked irregularities there is an 'island3 of clean sand (level 28) at a point where it takes a rather sudden dip. The level is bounded to the east by wall a (fig. 29). The main section cuts through it obliquely and shows that its construction should fall within or at the end of the period of accumulation of level 27. Of the same building period as wall a, and running parallel to it on the east, is wall ß. Both walls suffered considerably in later reconstruction. Wall ß survives only two or three stones deep; but the south end of wall a, behind the later terrace wall (6), is preserved to a height of 1 m. It is a rubble wall, 0.60 m. thick, built with medium stones of which there was, and still is, a plentiful supply from the ruined walls of the Early Bronze Age settlement immediately to the east. Flat slabs seem particularly to have been chosen, and there is as a result some rough coursing in places. That it was a free-standing wall is shown by the doorway, which was later blocked (plate I2¿). This was 0.60 m. wide. The wall's construction to the south of the doorway is appreciably poorer but there is no reason to believe that it belongs to a different period. The 'island' of sand (level 28) may have been laid deliberately to fill a depression, but the sand is clean and yielded no pottery. Being less than 2 m. above the present sea level and only 80 m. from the harbour it is possible that it was deposited in a flood, or by a tidal wave provoked by one of the many earthquakes which have shaken the island. Less than 1 km. to the south of Emporio stands an extinct volcano, Hephaisteion. At the extreme south of H appeared a short stretch of wall (y) only one stone deep, running at an angle to wall a. It lies immediately beneath the present ground surface and the soil was too disturbed for certain conclusions to be drawn from the stratigraphy. In the fill beside it (level 19) the only finds were fragments of what may be the earliest Geometric pottery on the site (plate 30, 157), so it is likely that wall y also belongs to the end of Period I.</page><page sequence="74">54 GREEK EMPORIO Period II The area between walls a and ß (fig. 29) seems to have formed a path leading away from the harbour, and the packed earth and stones (level 18) which lie between the two walls represent SECTION } »a,, WALL I 5»fe^ PIT X (^A^1-WALL K WALL 7 ÙTìSl WALL.

At one stage in the use of the path, at what is the end of our Period II, the doorway in wall a was blocked (plate 12e), and the space behind it was filled with successive layers of loose stones and earth (fig. 30: levels 21-25).

In the main section wall a only appears at a point where it is little preserved, but, to the south of the later terrace wall Ô, levels 21-25 run against the back of wall a and its blocked doorway. If there were any other walls supporting this fill to the north they were destroyed in the construc- tion of terrace wall 8 in Period III. The effect of these changes in Period II was to make the path, which had run between free-standing walls or enclosures, into a sunken ramp with a raised platform to the west, and, no doubt, to the east as well. Again, this period is only represented in H. SOUTH O I 2 3 1 » I 1 1 M. fig. 3 1 North-south Section in F. The composition of the levels is as follows : 1 . JJisturDea sunace sou. 2.

Small stones and earth, with harder-packed earth and few stone chips towards the south (Period IV). 7. Pebbles and earth (Period IV). 8. Burnt earth (Periods III-IV). 9. Loose stones and earth (Period III). Period III The pathway between walls a and ß remains open, but at the end of this period a new terrace wall (6) cuts across its line. It is constructed of unworked stones and has a slightly battered face far less carefully laid than that of the earlier wall a. Its back is not properly finished, but is formed by a jumble of stones, fairly loosely packed. The fill behind the wall is of stones and loose earth, level 20 in H (fig. 30). A short rubble wall (e) lies behind the terrace wall and may represent a stage in the filling operations. Remarkably similar rough walls were constructed by our own workmen to limit different stages in the re-filling of the trenches. Over the line of the old path the terrace is broken to admit a flight of steps (plates i i d, e, 12a). The old wall a is preserved as a back to the new terrace wall where it turns beside the steps, and a considerable part of it can still be distinguished in the north face of the new wall (plates i i¿/, 12a). To the north of this point wall a was destroyed and only its lower stones, which appear in the section in fig. 30, remain, below the new ground level at the foot of the terrace and its steps. This new surface is formed by a level (17) of packed reddish earth and stones which just covers the top of the remains of wall a. The same level runs across to the foot of the steps and covers the re- mains of wall ß. At this side the new terrace wall and platform project beyond the steps for at least 1 ' m.</page><page sequence="77">THE SANCTUARY TERRACES 57 The steps, of which five are preserved, are made of flat slabs, perhaps plundered from walls a and ß. Some, of white sandstone, seem to have been roughly squared, though not for their use in the steps. At either side they bond into terrace wall 6. The average height of each step is 0.15 m., and depth 0.40 m. The line of the terrace wall can be traced, where it swings back to the south, in an extension to the extreme west of H (fig. 28). In the north-east corner of G some of its backing stones appear with a fill of earth and loose stones, here immediately above virgin soil. Farther east a considerable stretch of it is found in F. Here its fill, level 9 in fig. 31, is again immediately above virgin soil, and the ground level before the wall is distinguished by a thin level (8) of ashy earth. The wall is here curving sharply away to the south, making a roughly semicircular platform. Period IV This is the main period of the use of the terrace with the steps. At the end of it a new terrace wall was constructed (wall 3) some 5 m. outside the old, and blocking the old approach. The fill behind it is of loose stones and earth (levels 11-16 in fig. 30). The wall itself is very well built, particularly in comparison with its predecessors. Medium, well-fitted stones are employed and faced to give the appearance of good rubble polygonal. The construction of the back of the wall, which spreads towards the base, is somewhat looser. The ground level before the wall is represented by a level of sandy red earth (level 9 in fig. 30) which overlies the packed earth and pebbles opposite its foundations (level 10). The line of the wall appears again in F with a similar fill behind it (levels 6-7 in fig. 31). Here it is 1 m. wide instead of the 0.80 m. in H, and it may be preserved to its full height. This is suggested by the way in which its top is levelled at about 2.80 m. above sea level. Above this runs a line of stones forming the back of a wall set o. 15-20 m. in from the back of the terrace wall (plate i2úf: its position is dotted onto the section in fig. 31). It may be that this represents a free-standing wall edging the terrace, but only its lowest stones are preserved. On the top of wall 3, at the point at which it cuts the section in fig. 31, is a roughly rectangular slab (plate 12c), measuring 1.08x0.88x0.04-5 m. It might well be a displaced paving stone from above the terrace, for it lies at the presumed top of the wall at the same level as the foot of the presumed free-standing wall just described. Ground level before the wall is represented by level 4 in fig. 31. In A there is part of another terrace wall (r' : fig. 32) whose thickness (0.80 m.), construction, fill and apparent date (from the pottery in the fill) make it certain that it belongs to the same complex as terrace wall 3. Its face is to the west, so it cannot be a continuation of wall 3, but it may well have faced it on the other side of a path leading onto the platform. Behind it one face of a rubble wall (0) was uncovered. It abuts onto the back of wall r|, its base being 0.40 m. above the foot ofthat wall; it was covered by the fill behind wall r), and its purpose, unless it be a structural stage in the building of the main entrance, is obscure. Wall r| continues in B where it is turning west. Period V This first stage in the use of the new terrace wall (3) is marked by the construction at the north of H of a local extension to the main terrace. Wall 1, 0.60 m. thick, runs at a slight angle to the latest terrace wall and about 2 m. from it. It is exceptionally well faced with hammer-dressed stones which have been roughly squared and laid in courses, the interstices being filled with</page><page sequence="78">58 GREEK EMPORIO small stones. The back of the wall spreads slightly to the base. The fill behind it is of loose stones and earth (levels 6-8 in fig. 30), and the top of the terrace wall 3 seems to have been demolished in the course of its construction. Ground level at its face is represented by the top of a level of reddish earth (level 5), into which was sunk the footing course, in places projecting slightly from the wall-line. The wall is apparently preserved here to its full height, as a short stretch of a free-standing wall (k) rises above it and at right-angles to it over its top and over the top of wall 3. No other walling of this type appeared in association with the terrace of Period IV in other trenches, nor is there any other structure on the site which appears to be of exactly the same date.

Period VI The pits and levels attributed to Period VI form a unity by virtue of the pottery found in them and not through any close stratigraphical connections between them. Three pits were sunk into the surface of the latest terrace and just behind its face (fig. 28). Pit X in H lies just behind the new wall of Period V and its lower part was roughly lined with stones ; it contained small stones, blackened earth and pottery. Pit Y in F was paved with stones and its construction destroyed part of the buried wall-line of Period IV; its contents were as Pit X. Pit Z in A lacked any stone lining but its sides were hardened by fire; it held only blackened earth and pottery. On the other side of the wall from Pit Z there was a shallow level of packed brown earth full of</page><page sequence="79">THE SANCTUARY TERRACES 59 fragmentary pottery of the same period (level 5 in fig. 32), and a similar strew of pottery of this date appeared at the same depth in C and D. The few fragments recovered from beneath the paving under the foundations of the fifth-century temple in E seem likely to be part of the same level. Area A The terrace wall, levels and pit of Periods IV-VI have been described above. In the southern half of this trench the archaic Greek remains were overlaid by a mass of loosely packed stones (fig. 32). These were contained by a wall face (A) which turns a right angle to the south west. At this point it runs over terrace wall r' of Period IV. It is loosely built and includes, near its * O 2M. fig. 33 Cistern in Area A. angle, a small, roughly shaped white sandstone column drum or base of archaic type. The purpose of the structure, which is at no point preserved higher than 0.50 m., is not clear. It can hardly have served as the foundation or footing for any substantial building. The stone fill yielded some archaic pottery (inevitable with the terrace so close), but also many coarse frag- ments of uncertain date, and scraps of red-painted plaster. It is unlikely to be earlier than the Roman period, and is most probably mediaeval. The short stretch of walling at the extreme south-east of the trench is probably modern. In the west the archaic ground level (5 in fig. 32) outside the terrace wall was cut through for the construction of a cistern (fig. 33). The isolated stretch of wall overlapping its south-east corner is mediaeval, if not modern. The cistern is built of roughly squared blocks, many of them taken from other buildings. Its sides converged towards the top, that on the east having slipped</page><page sequence="80">6o GREEK EMPORIO forward a little out of its original position. On this side the upper three courses which are pre- served rise vertically, while on the west the convergence continues. The north and south sides are vertical. Owing to the restricted space and the overhanging blocks the cistern could not be completely excavated. Behind the well-fitted inner blocks the thickness of the cistern wall varies from over i m. on the east to 0.75 at the south. The blocks are more loosely composed and outside them the pit which was dug for the construction of the cistern is filled with loose stones and earth. This fill (level 2 in fig. 32) contained many fragments of plain, unpainted tiles, certainly earlier than those found in the Late Roman levels on the site, and probably Hellenistic although none are painted. Of the coarse pottery fragments there were several Chian amphora feet of fourth and third century b.c. types. There were also fragments of red-painted plaster, as in the fill behind wall À. One of the stones in the cistern wall is a geison-and-sima block which cannot be earlier than the second century b.c., and a fragment of a similar block was found in the fill behind the cistern wall (see p. 95, nos. 71 ¿z, b) . The first century a.D., in which the outlines of the Basilica were laid and which is otherwise well represented on the site in coins and pottery, probably also saw the construction of the cistern. It is too well built to belong to the later main period of occupation on the site in the sixth and seventh centuries a.D.; then, the cisterns found in the Late Roman fortress are built in a very different style. It was probably not still open in the Late Roman period, but it is not possible to be certain about this as its floor was not reached in the excavation. Areas i?, C and D In B the top of the continuation of terrace wall r| (Period IV: fig. 28) was come upon imme- diately below the stone heap, here over 1 m. deep. Only the footings of the wall, 0.40 m. deep, remained, and none of the ground surface before the wall was preserved. In C, at the edge of the stone heap, the trench was abandoned at a depth of 2 m. The surface levels contained scraps of cement but 1 m. below the field surface a level of reddish earth and stones yielded scraps of sixth-century pottery. D told the same story. The height above sea-level of this archaic strew is c. 3.50 m. Area E The account of the excavation of the foundations of the fifth-century temple and their description are reserved for Section 3. The foundations had been robbed by the builders of the Basilica Church, and above them was the fill of the plunder-pit. This contained clean earth and few stones with a little pottery, including some early Greek votives from a disturbed deposit nearby. The description of the surface levels and of the late graves and walls which lay behind the Church belong with the account ofthat building. Area F The isolated trench to the south of the main excavation in this area had to be abandoned after its surface levels had yielded mixed Roman and archaic pottery. Above wall 3, levels 3 and 5 (fig. 31) held mixed rubbish from the later years of the sanctu- ary's existence. The chips in level 2 suggest the re-working of the blocks from the classical buildings, no doubt in the Roman period.</page><page sequence="81">THE SANCTUARY TERRACES 6l Area H The main section (fig. 30) has been used to illustrate the stratigraphy of all the main Periods above. The upper part of the latest terrace wall, and the houses that apparently stood at its edge, collapsed, and their debris appears in level 3. This lies above a thick level of earth and stones (level 4) which gives something of the appearance of a fill rather than a casual accumula- tion. No pottery in levels 3 and 4 is later than that found in Pit X, which presumably represents the latest occupation of the houses on the terrace. It may be that these buildings had a compara- tively short life. At the extreme west of H the continuation of wall 6 was found preserved to a height of 0.60 m. Before its face the stone and earth fill was of the same character and date as that which ap- peared in the main section. 1.30 m. in front of the wall stood a roughly cut stone column shaft, 0.80 m. high and 0.40 m. in diameter (plate 120). Its top was level with the preserved top of wall 6 at this point; its bottom was sunk into the ground level before the terrace, and, as it is vertical and apparently in its original position, it probably belongs to the period after the con- struction of the wall (Period IV). A very similar shaft was found in one of the archaic houses on Prophètes Elias hill, which is of about the same date. Whether this too is from a house is not clear. Certainly the ground level in which it was sunk had no appearance of being a house floor. The continuation of the shaft was no doubt wooden. Area J (inset in fig. 28) The trench was dug to 1.50 m. from the surface to clean sand. There were no significant levels, and pottery of all periods was found throughout. Most was of the main period of the archaic terraces and included votive material. Other sources of Greek material beside the harbour A trial trench (K: inset in fig. 28) 20 m. from the south side of the harbour, which was dug to trace the extent of the prehistoric levels in this area, came upon a mass of broken Hellenistic lagynoi and other vases, apparently from a rubbish pit (see below, vase 928) . In the surface levels of the main trenches in the prehistoric settlement, which lay between the archaic sanctuary terraces and the acropolis by the harbour, there were occasional sherds and fragments of figurines. Most were of the main period of the archaic deposits but the fourth and third centuries b.c. were also represented. On the acropolis south of the harbour there were no undisturbed levels between the Myce- naean and the construction of the Late Roman fortress in the seventh century a.d. There was, however, a great variety of vase fragments in the surface levels. Few were geometric; many of the sixth-century b.c., including finely painted pieces; and continuous occupation into the Hel- lenistic period is suggested by the finds of black-figure, red-figure and later plain wares. Chian amphora toes of the fourth century b.c. were particularly common. Chronology The earliest pottery, still Protogeometric in appearance, may go back to the ninth century, and the skyphos with pendent semi-circles (157) is likely to have been made before the mid- eighth century. Most of the pottery of the Period I levels belongs to the later eighth century and</page><page sequence="82">62 GREEK EMPORIO may even go into the seventh. The minor objects are most readily matched with Geometric finds elsewhere. The pottery, especially the craters, is related to the earlier group distinguished by Johansen in the vases from Exochi, and which he rightly puts mainly in the eighth century. The skyphoi and bird bowls of Period I are also eighth-century types. 690 may perhaps be considered a reasonable date for the construction of the walls which mark the end of our Period I. Leaving aside Periods II and III for the moment we have to consider Period IV. The mass of Early Corinthian and the Wild Goat vases in levels of this period show that its end cannot be put later than the end of the Early Corinthian period. The finds of all types of object closely match those found at Old Smyrna before the Alyattan destruction. In setting the end of Period IV at 600 1 am following the conventional dating. A slightly lower date may prove to be justified. Periods II to IV span the seventh century. The relative quantity of finds from these periods is, of course, not significant, but the stylistic development of the pottery, notably cups and craters, suggests that Period III was perhaps somewhat shorter than Periods II and IV. The distinction is a fine one and need not be observed in the conventional dates which may be assigned to the periods, allowing them about 30 years - a generation - each. The Corinthian scrap (653) in a Period III level suits this dating very well. Period V sees the last stage of the decorated slipped chalices and the slipped black-figure styles. These, with the scraps of Attic and East Greek cups, bring us to the mid-sixth century; perhaps after, rather than before. The pits of Period VI have later Attic black-figure and carry us to the end of the century. Other sites teach us that pits filled with fine broken pottery may betoken the clearing-up after a disaster. At Emporio this might have been the Persian reprisals in 492, but I use the round, non-committal date 500 for the filling of the pits. The next fixed point in the history of the site is the construction of the apsidal temple, but no excavated levels or finds can be associated with it, or with its predecessor which stood in Period VI (see below, Section 3). With the provisos and cautions already expressed the following broad chronology for the Harbour Sanctuary periods is proposed: Period I -690 II -660 III -630 IV -600 V -550 VI -500. 2. THE TEMPLE CULT AND OFFERINGS There is direct evidence about the cult in the Harbour Sanctuary from the inscriptions on some of the votives. From the early part of the seventh century is an incomplete graffito, ipr| (plate 97, 613), in which it is tempting to read the name of the goddess to whom the vase was dedicated. There can, of course be no certainty about this; and if correct this is the first mention of a Hera in Chios. Apart from her famous sanctuary on Samos the goddess is seldom found in Ionia. Before the end of the seventh century Artemis is named in a painted inscription on a vase (615), and a sixth-century graffito gives Apollo (632). Apollo was worshipped in many places in Ionia. In Chios there was the famous sanctuary of Apollo Phanaios only 9 km. from Emporio, and there too Artemis is found beside her brother. At Dotia an inscription mentions Apollo Agretes,1 and it is possible that the stone is from Emporio, only 2.5 km. away. Artemis 1 BCH'ni (1879) 322 f. no. 8.</page><page sequence="83">THE TEMPLE CULT AND OFFERINGS 63 may originally have been the senior deity in the sanctuary, inheriting from some Bronze Age or Anatolian, Kybele-like goddess who was worshipped there. The seventh-century votives, here as at Phanai, certainly indicate an Artemis (or even a Hera). Apollo's position may have become better established later. Fragments of a fine marble Apollo (plate 70, 8-12), made at the time that a classical, apsidal temple was built in the sanctuary, might have been from its cult statue, and would confirm his importance there in the fifth century. With the Artemis on one of the late seventh-century inscriptions (615) is mentioned another deity, cPt|t[ . . . From the attested divine or mythological names only TrjTÍcc (better 'Putíoc) will fit. She was mother of the Korybants by Apollo, but has no particular connection with Chios that has been recorded. It may be remarked that an etymology connecting 'Pirrícc with words like pr|TÍvr|, 'resin', might have found more favour in a wine- (and mastic-) growing area of Chios in antiquity, than it could with present-day philologists. However, the restoration of the name is not certain, and cPtit . . . may be some local nymph, otherwise not known to us. The patron of the vine himself is not mentioned until the mid-fifth century, on the inscribed base, eHpó6oTo[s"] Aiev[ (plate 72, 23). 1 Dionysos was a partner of Apollo at Delphi and other sanctuaries, but no excuses need be found for his worship in a vine-growing island, founded by one of his sons. A statue base of the later sixth century, the dedication of a freed slave, does not mention any deity (plate 72, 22) ,2 The inscriptional evidence can take us no further, although there are many dedicatory inscriptions from south-east Chios many of which might have been carried from Emporio. They have been published by W. G. Forrest in BSA lviii (1963) 53 ff.; lix (1964) 32 if. The rest of this story of the cult must be told by the votives. The most important single class in the main period of the votive deposits, the seventh century, is of bronze belts. I give elsewhere reasons for belief that they were worn by women. To be given as votives they must have been considered the symbolical TrocpOeviKorì ¿covai which were surrendered at marriage, or rather dedicated to a Hera, Artemis or Aphrodite just before marriage.3 In Ionia they were not merely symbolical offerings but actual articles of everyday dress, as the repairs on some found at Em- porio prove, and the provision for increasing girth implies. Ionian korai wear them well into the sixth century, as virgin priestesses or votaries. And in the only extant representation of a belt of exactly this form it is worn by a winged Artemis, potuta theron. In Ionia the belts are given to Hera on Samos, to Artemis at Ephesos, to 'a goddess' at Smyrna, and no doubt to Artemis at Phanai and Emporio.4 There were no belts in the offerings in the Athena Temple on Prophètes Elias. Other articles of female toilet form the bulk of the minor votives in the sanc- tuary : fibulae, ear- and finger-rings, tweezers, pins and needles, beads. There is little in precious metal, but any notable offerings in gold or silver might not have been swept into the deposits. Among the clay figurines there are many of women - votaries or goddesses - but none with decisive attributes. There are also some of men, especially some kouroi of the late seventh cen- tury. Some, too, of animals, mainly cattle, such as were found in the Heraion at Samos. They throw no light on the cult but it is remarkable that they are almost entirely absent from the votives of the Athena Temple, although this was the nearest sanctuary for the local agrarian population living in the town on the slopes of Prophètes Elias. The clay bulls replace or com- memorate richer offerings to the gods, humbler counterparts to the many bronze bulls at Olympia. The clay votive shields which were an important feature of the votives in the Athena Temple are very poorly represented in the Harbour Sanctuary. Nor is there any great number of 1 Forrest, BSA lviii (1963) 60 f. 2 Ibid. 56, pl. 17b. * Cf. Rouse, Greek Votive Offerings 249. 4 For references to the use, representation and distribu- tion of these Ionian belts see my article in Anatolia vi (1961) 1 79 ff., supplemented in Anatolian Studies xvi (1966) 193 f.</page><page sequence="84">64 GREEK EMPORIO weapons, for the few iron spear-heads and bronze arrow-heads, with the fish-hooks, bear witness to an interest in hunting, or fishing, rather than war. Many of the finer pieces, the bronze vases, cauldrons, ivories and the more elaborately decorated clay vases were dedicated for their intrinsic value alone. There is little in the pottery which suggests any particular cult vessels, apart from fragments of what may have been a clay votive table and basin; and there are but few lamps, against the many from the Athena Temple. The greater part of the decorated pottery is cups, jugs and mixing bowls for wine. These were no doubt the principal items of table ware for which decoration was generally expected, and we do not need to deduce wine-feasts in the sanctuary, although the gods there were surely accorded their share of the vintage and were celebrated at the crater as much as at the altar. The plain kantharoi with bespoken, painted dedicatory inscriptions are a feature of Chian sixth-century pottery, met also at Phanai, and in Aegina and Naukratis. The Harbour Sanctuary naturally attracted more votives of foreign origin than did the Athena Temple. The belts indicate the close relationship between Phrygian and Ionian bronze working, and in Period III we have part of a Phrygian cauldron (383). Even earlier, in Period I/II there is a seal (536), probably Cilician. With Period IV, while Chios and other Ionian states were active at Naukratis, we find Egyptian faience (579) and bronze (408) ; earlier still is the scarab (537), and later the faience scarabs, no doubt from Naukratis (539, A). Cyprus provides almost the bulk of the votive clay figurines in Period IV. Bronze spiral beads, double- spiral rings and a fibula, as well as the amber beads, suggest some sort of contact with the upper Balkans. There is one Etruscan vase of the late seventh century (plate 43, 480). For imports from other parts of the Greek world we are obliged to look mainly at the pottery and clay figurines, although an early ivory seal (534) and the limestone statuettes of Cypriot type (1-3) may be from Rhodes. Among the Geometric and Sub-geometric wares imports are not easy to distinguish, although at least one cup (157) of the eighth century is from some Euboean or Cycladic centre. Distinctive types of Rhodian pottery - bird bowls and Wild Goat vases - become more common towards the end of the seventh century and in the early sixth, but never numerous because Chios had her own finely decorated wares. For the same reason there is very little Corinthian, the earliest being of the middle of the seventh century, and less Attic black-figure; no Lakonian and only one fragment of Fikellura - both so common on Samos. East Greek figurines and figure-vases are popular in Chios, as on other Ionian and Rhodian sites, through the sixth century and into the fifth. We have no good votive deposits of the fifth century or later and the scraps of Attic red-figure can tell nothing of the possible volume of trade in this ware. Little enough of it has been found anywhere on the island. 3. THE ARCHITECTURE The architectural history of the houses and buildings on Prophètes Elias has been discussed above. This section is devoted to the architectural remains, other than the terrace walls, from beside the harbour at Emporio. All are from the Sanctuary Area and largely comprise stones built into the Early Christian Basilica Church, although part of the foundations of a late archaic and of a classical temple are preserved in situ. The material is published here in catalogue form preceded by a discussion of the probable original associations of the most important blocks and mouldings and of their date. Only one building, the fifth-century temple, can be recon- structed with any degree of certainty. A note is appended on some architectural remains in the neighbourhood of Emporio.</page><page sequence="85">THE ARCHITECTURE 65 The sixth-century Temple and Mouldings, The main source of information about the sixth-century temple in the Harbour Sanctuary is the collection of worked blocks found beneath the clamped foundations of the fifth-century temple which is described below. Here an approximately square area with sides measuring 6.42 (north to south) and 6.22 (east to west) was filled with a single level, some 0.25 deep, of stones and worked blocks (fig. 34; plates 13, 140). The north-eastern quarter of the square was not excavated. The rest of the northern and western sides of the square are for the most part covered by the remaining clamped blocks of the later temple. The southern l . •. i 1 - wi r ;• I . - u . ■ • . p^i- r ~v - ~~&gt; ' /~*~~* Ì ? , , 1 fig. 34 Plan and Elevation of Temple Foundations. side and such of the eastern as has been exposed were filled largely with curved wall blocks (3 in the catalogue below; plate 130) laid two deep, side by side. The core of the square was filled to the same level with unworked stones, and smaller stones filled the crevices between them. It is clear that these were laid to provide a level basis for the lowest course of the clamped founda- tions of the fifth-century building and we may reasonably assume that the curved blocks belong to some building which the new temple was to replace. That it was to replace it in the same position is suggested by two things. First, by the presence beneath this square of a laid stone pavement or foundation, which can have no connection with preparations for the fifth-century</page><page sequence="86">66 GREEK EMPORIO building. This appeared at the south-western corner of the square where the covering blocks had been shifted, and a small area was cleared to reveal well-fitted paving of irregularly shaped stones (fig. 34; plate 13d). This could well have served as foundation for an earlier building. The second factor suggesting the presence of the earlier building here is the size of the square. Its regular proportions and the fact that it could hardly bear any relation to the length, at least, of the later building show that its size was not determined by the later building but by an earlier. No doubt the paving covered the entire square1 and the area was made up to the required level by blocks from the earlier building when the foundations for the new one were to be laid and the ground level appreciably raised. &lt;^' / J H 1 J2 K# I V/ 1 J2 I V/ / !" / fig. 35 Isometrics of mouldings i and 2, and reconstruction. The curved faces of the blocks (3) have a radius of about 2.45. Set on foundations of the square with sides of about 6.40 this would give a circular building with a free way a little under 0.80 at each side. If the building is to be limited to this square an apsidal building, such as that which succeeded it, seems out of the question, although the absence of straight wall blocks from the stone fill proves nothing, for they could have been more readily re-used than the curved blocks. The significance of its shape, whether circular or apsidal, will be discussed below, together with that of the fifth-century temple. Two curved mouldings from the same stone fill have the same radius and probably belong to the same buildings. They would appear to represent wall-crown and wall-base (2, 1, figs. 35, 52). These, and the wall blocks, are all the evidence we have for the reconstruction of the building. They have rough backs, and it may be that the inside of the wall was finished with 1 In places it may have been cut into by the superimposed wall blocks. Thus, no paving was preserved beneath the moulding 2; cf. plate 130?.</page><page sequence="87">THE ARCHITECTURE 67 rough small stones. The treatment would then have been much as in the Athena Temple on Prophètes Elias where two courses of small, rough stones backed each main ashlar course (plate 4Í). The Athena Temple is a close contemporary ofthat in the Harbour Sanctuary so the com- parison is just. The blocks for both buildings too were cut from the distinctive white sandstone of Prophètes Elias. The curved blocks seem not to have the delicate drafted margins seen on the better preserved blocks on the Athena Temple, but they show anathyrosis at the lateral joints, and one at least still carries its lifting boss. No stone or clay members can be attributed to the roof. That of the Athena Temple was certainly flat. Of the doorway or internal arrangements we know nothing. Two curved blocks from the Basilica area might have formed part of the same building (45, 46; fig. 44). One has a partly concave face, and if it does belong it shows that part at least of the building had a finished interior to the walls, as did the porch of the Athena Temple, but its other dimensions do not agree well with the curved blocks from beneath the clamped foundations. Another curved block with a broken, indeterminate moulding might also belong (83, fig. 57). For an assembly of the preserved mouldings of the wall see fig. 35. The half-round mouldings are primitive Ionic. That of the wall-crown we might expect to find carved with leaves, or, later, egg and dart, but on both mouldings the mason has been economical. The eggs and broad darts on analogous early Ionic mouldings reflect those overlapping-leaf girdles on Near Eastern furniture and bronzes which suggested to Ionian architects the use of the motif for monumental architecture. The hanging leaves were generally undercut in a realistic manner. So are some of the earliest Ionic eggs and darts, and so is our wall-crown although it lacks the surface carving which would have made more sense of the undercutting. Perhaps the closest parallel for the moulding is that of the crown to the so-called Rhoikos Altar at the Heraion on Samos, which is dated to about the middle of the sixth century.1 The half-round of the wall-base with its flat facets has no close parallels, but again is strongly reminiscent of the early Samian experiments in the first dipteron (the 'Rhoikos Temple') where the half-rounds on column bases sometimes carry very shallow flutes.2 The Samian parallels suggest a date around the middle of the sixth century for the Emporio building. Fragments of plain cups found in a limited excavation beneath the paving of its probable foundation seem, from the quality of their white slip, to belong to the first half of the sixth century, and do nothing to contradict this dating though they are too slight to lend strong confirmation to it. With some early mouldings at Phanai3 these blocks represent the earliest Chian monumental architecture so far identified; humble, but hardly less ancient counterparts to the bolder experiments on Samos and at Ephesos. There are some other mouldings which can be attributed to the sixth century and which give evidence for other monumental buildings on the site, although it is possible that they were in some way associated with the presumed circular temple, perhaps from its altar or some other related structure. First is a fragment of a large ovolo moulding carved with pendent leaves in the same stone as the blocks from the temple (49; fig. 46; plate 17). Too little is preserved for absolute cer- tainty that its face was not curved, but it seems likely that this was not so. The long pendent leaves had rounded bases, and it is not certain that the ridges between them finished below as darts. They do not on a very similar moulding from Phanai, although there the ridges seem less pronounced.4 The Phanai moulding gives a good impression of the appearance of the Emporio 1 Schleif, AM lviii (1933) 200 fig. 25; and compare Weickert, Das lesbische Kymation pl. 1 ; the ivory mouldings from Gordion, Tumulus II, Körte, Gordion 1 10 f., figs. 87-89, dated by Akurgal {Phrygische Kunst 131) to 560-50 on the strength of these mouldings ; also the crowning moulding to altars on the 'Pontic' vases: Ducati, Pontische Vasen pl. 9b; Reading, CVA i pl. 37. ic. 2 Cf. ^4Mlxii (1937) 19 f., figs. 1-2. 3 Cf.

Very similar leaves appear on a capital from Phokaia, and they recall the capital at Old Smyrna and a straight moulding from Neandria.1 Their occurrence in Chios reminds one of her early artistic relations with the Aeolic-North Ionian group. The carving is of the tradition which leads to the broad, pointed leaves on the Ephesos column bases, but the Chian examples need not be older than Ephesos, though they should not be much later or far from the middle of the sixth century in date. A series of fragments from a moulding carved in white marble can also be attributed to the sixth century (50, 51; plate 17; figs. 47, 49). Above a rope roll is a half-round carved with volutes, palmettes and darts in a pattern closely following the form of the egg and dart which normally decorates such a moulding. With other mouldings from Phanai it stands at the head of a series of Chian carved mouldings which elaborate the normal egg or leaf and darts. The series has already been studied in detail by the present writer in Ant. J. xxxix (1959) 189 ff., and the Emporio pieces assigned to the last quarter of the sixth century on grounds of the style of the palmettes. The rope moulding also appears at Phanai and is an early application of the motif to monumental architecture.2 The moulding is small, and might have decorated the top of a wall within a room or porch, possibly around a door, or perhaps on a smaller structure, as an altar. It recalls the Ionic wall-base moulding, but with its elaborate carving was not likely to have been used in this position. An inscribed statue base dated on letter forms to the last third of the sixth century3 may have been from the immediate neighbourhood of the sixth-century temple. The base has a lifting boss on its face, such as we have noted on one of the curved blocks. Bosses also appear on a large series of rectangular blocks of white sandstone (43; cf. plate 140) from the Basilica Church but no place for them can be readily assigned in association with the sixth-century building and another explanation for them is suggested below. The circular temple stood on the broad platform made by the latest of the excavated terrace walls (wall 3 in fig. 28) and was approached from the harbour by the road flanking the terrace wall, which turned onto the level of the temple to the east of it, presumably before its altar. There is less than 1 m. difference in the levels of the temple paving, the top of the terrace wall to the north, the apparent road level to its east and the strew of sixth-century sherds found in Areas A, C and D (fig. 28) to the east and south-east of the temple. The Fifth-century Temple. The clamped foundations of the fifth-century temple, or at least that corner of them that remained in situ, were discovered in the course of the excavation of the adjacent Basilica Church (fig. 34; plates 13, 14a). The apse of this building was found to be abutting onto and partly supported by the foundations of another apsidal building facing in the opposite direction (plate 130). Curved wall blocks, presumably from this building (22, 23; figs. 43, 52) had in fact been used in the Church's apse. Most of the foundation blocks had been removed and used in the floor of the Church (47, 48; plate 140?; fig. 45) and only that corner of the foundations left undisturbed which underlay the proposed apse for the building. The lowest foundations, in a rough square, and the paving underlying them have already been described. Above them three courses of clamped foundations were preserved in the north- western corner. The lower two courses are of rectangular limestone blocks averaging 1.25 in length, 0.65 in width and 0.28 in height. They were secured by two clamps in each long side, 1 Phokaia: Anatolia v (i960) pl. ib; Smyrna: ibid., pl. ia, and JHS Ixxii (1952) pl. 6.3 (late seventh century); Kolde- wey, Neandria 29 fig. 59, and compare the capitals ibid. 34-38 figs. 60-62, and the Thasos capital, Anatolia v (i960) pl. 5*- 2 Ant.

On these two courses stand three wedge-shaped blocks of another course of the same height. The edge of these blocks describes an arc of a circle which almost exactly fills the width of the square formed by the lower foundations; that is, with a radius of about 3.15. They were secured by two clamps on each side, and one block has a clamp at its inner edge, so the foundations must have been continuous in this course and not confined to the perimeter, beneath the outer walls of the completed building. The blocks also have square holes for metal dowels in their top surface with runnels to their outer edge. In one some of the lead is still preserved. Their presence suggests that the euthyn teria of the building came immediately above. The rectangular blocks beneath were smoothed to take the curved blocks and the edge of the levelled circle appears where the covering blocks are now missing. The clamps are of the usual swallow-tail type, cut deep and without any sinkings for the pegs such as appear in the swallow-tail clamp holes in wall blocks from the temple. The clamps would have been of lead or, more probably, wood.1 The curved blocks, and the cutting for others missing, show that the western half of the square foundations was filled with the curved wall of the building. The square might suggest that we are dealing with a circular building but, as I have shown, its outline was determined by an earlier structure. Its measurements east to west (6.22) are also rather tight for a full circle of radius c. 3.15. It seems most probable that the clamped foundations continued to the east for some un- determined distance beyond the lower square.2 The limits of excavation and the irregular sides of the Late Roman plunder pit which was dug to remove most of the clamped stones have pre- cluded precision on this point; but it is clear from the section that the disturbance of the plun- der pit continues to the east on the level of the clamped foundations, but not on the level of the lower square and paving, where, strangely, not even trace of a sixth-century ground surface was found. Also, there are not so many curved foundation blocks from elsewhere in the Basilica Church (47) that the semicircle is more than filled. It seems, therefore, safe to attribute to these foundations the mouldings and blocks of a tetrastyle apsidal building of the Ionic order which were recovered from the foundations of the apse of the adjacent Basilica Church and elsewhere near by. The radius of the curved blocks and mouldings attributed to this building exactly suit the curved foundation blocks. These blocks and mouldings suggest an apsidal building about 6 m. wide, with four prostyle Ionic columns. Enough is preserved to reconstruct the columns (except for the lowest member of the base), the antae, and perhaps the wall-crown and -base with other decorative mouldings including a possible epistyle crown. Mouldings from the altar too may be identified. The material employed is Chian blue marble with white marble inlays on the column capitals and other white marble decorative mouldings. Consideration of the style, date and pertinence of the several parts of the building follows. The Columns. The major parts of one corner capital and one ordinary capital (5, 7; figs. 36, 37; plate 16) were found in the foundations of the apse of the Basilica Church, immediately beside the clamped foundations of the building to which they are attributed. The shallow convex channels of the volutes declare them of the general class of Ionic capital in use in East Greece from the inception of the form, before the middle of the sixth century, to the time of its surrender to the concave-channeled capitals which were current elsewhere in Greece. In general appear- ance they belong with the Ephesian type of capital with the rounded volute shoulders, abacus, 1 Martin, Manuel i 238 ff.

The volutes begin with two members of equal size which unroll into channel and dividing astragal; the volutes are developed in a similar manner on an earlier capital from Phanai.2 The palmettes in the volute corners were inlaid in white marble except for the inner 1 The distinction drawn by von Gerkan (Milet i.8 66 f. ; cf.

The volute eyes were also inlaid, a practice not uncommon on Ionic capitals1 where the eye may also be carved as a rosette. The inlaid palmettes are, however, unusual.2 A V^ÉH rÈm/ ^f fig. 37 Ionic capital, 7, and echinus profiles of capitals 5 and 7.

It is constructed in the normal classical manner with the outer volutes back to back and projecting obliquely from the capital's main faces.1 There are a number of differences in the carving of the two preserved capitals which cannot be attributed simply to their differing functions, and must, at least, imply the work of different masons not working to any very detailed pattern. The proportions of the faces of the capitals differ slightly ; thus : 5 (corner capital) 7 (ordinary capital) height of abacus 0.05 0.03 height of cushion 0.21 0.23 height of echinus o. 1 1 3 0.094 On the echinus the corner capital carries more rounded eggs, and the profiles of this member on each capital may be compared in fig. 37. Again, the corner capital has 20 eggs, the other 24, and the diameters beneath the echinus differ by 0.014, though this is but a slight discrepancy. The volute channels on the corner capital have a more rounded profile, the cushion sides are more pinched and the scotiae more elliptical. In general its execution is very much finer and it must remain possible that the other capital (7) is a later replacement. Although the capitals are of a well-known type there are very few comparable examples for which reasonable dates can be assigned on grounds other than the unreliable one of 'architec- tural style5. Capitals at Kavalla2 are distinguished by having concave volute channels on one face, convex on the other. The disc decoration at their cushion centres suggests a date in the early fifth century, though not at its very beginning. The egg and dart of the echinus is close to that of the Emporio corner capital, as is the swing of the cushion's outline above. Otherwise the Kavalla capitals have heavier volutes, more archaic in appearance. A capital from Miletos3 must post-date the Persian sack of 494 b.c. It is unhappily fragmentary but of the same general type as the Emporio capitals, and an egg and dart moulding associated4 is very close to our echinus. A capital from Didyma should also be post-Persian,5 cushion sides and echinus are like Emporio but the volute member is shallow and elongated, perhaps because of the capital's function for a votive column, not simply architectural. A capital in Athens6 has a floral in the cushion centre which dates it to the second quarter of the fifth century, but it offers few points of comparison with the Emporio pieces; nor do the capitals from the temple at Maraza (Locri Epizephyrii), which can be dated about the middle of the fifth century by the carved mouldings on the building.7 The Emporio capitals belong chronologically and stylistically somewhere in the range of these pieces; certainly in the first half of the fifth century, not at its very beginning; probably as late as its second quarter. The column shafts were unfluted, and were probably never intended to be carved. The upper column diameters (given by the capitals) were 0.473 and 0.487, the lower (given by the base) 0.54, and fragments, as well as one drum with a circular peg hole (15, 16), give diameters between these extremes. At Phanai also all the column shafts are unfluted but for one small drum which may not be from a building.8 Part of one column base was re-used in the Basilica Church (12; plate 150?; fig. 52). Carved in one piece are the apophyge of the shaft, a shallow astragal and the main torus of the base. 1 On early corner capitals in Ionic see Gruben, Jdl 1xxvíü(iq63) 159 fr. 2 AE 1936, 8 fT., figs. 10-27. 3 Aft7t*i.8,66fig. 37. 4 Ibid., 68 fig. 38. 5 Didyma i 147 f., pls. 210-1. 0 The Inwood capital, Jacobsthal Greek Pins 07, hg. 283 and cf.

On the analogy of the capitals1 the disc might well have been carved with scotiae in the Ephesian manner, though it is possible that, as at Phanai, a Chian variety of the normal Ephesian form was employed.2 The torus is not carved at all, although we would * ^7 &gt; [ ' ' "7 •84 5 &lt;1 .42 X -5* &gt; If ^i^L - &gt;^J 7 I ^i^L * &gt;^J ' K / 735 &gt; •04 ' £j A f|^ ' /&gt; 74 &gt;CZI fig. 38 Anta capital, 17. expect horizontal flutes of the usual type. In the circumstances a final possibility for the restora- tion of the disc is that it also lacked all elaboration, and this noncommittal form is restored in fig. 42. There might also, or even instead, have been a shallow rectangular plinth below the disc. The ovolo-like profile of the torus is foreshadowed in the bases from the second dipteron 1 See above, n. 1, p. 70. 2 Ant.

The simplicity of the base belies its antiquity. Some far later Ionic bases, as those in the Hypostyle Hall on Delos,4 are deceptively similar. The proportions of the column members suggest a complete height for each column of about 4.5 m. On a foundation 6.30 wide four columns of this height could be most satisfactorily spaced. The corner capitals prove that they were prostyle, not in antis. The Antae. The two anta capitals were built into the corners of the foundations for the apse of the Basilica Church (17, 18; plate 14 ¿, c; fig. 38). The usual East Greek Ionic anta capital, used for both buildings and altars (it is often difficult to determine for which they were intended) have a triple roll moulding, usually with carved decoration at the front, and cavetto sides, sometimes also carved.5 The Emporio antae, with two flat fasciae above a single ovolo moulding, though still with cavetto sides, represents significant deviation from the norm. A very close parallel at the Aeolic site 'Larisa' has palmettes carved at the sides which suggest a date early in the fifth century.6 Intermediate types in which one or two straight or cavetto mouldings lie above two or three ovolo or roll mouldings appear at Larisa and on Lesbos, with a fragmentary but comparable example on Samos.7 It would appear that the 'pure' triple form of southern Ionia becomes modified farther north. Chios is again found to have as much in common with Aeolis as with the heart of Ionia. That these anta capitals are better attributed to the same building as the column capitals than to an altar, a position often suggested for such mem- bers, is indicated as much as anything by their exact correspondence in height to the column capitals. The 'tongues' behind the antae which run on into the anta wall are 0.735 an^ 0.745 wide, but are neither of them regular as their widths immediately behind the carved forepart are 0.74 and 0.755. Discrepancies of a centimetre or so between the two capitals show to what extent rule-of-thumb measurements were applied to buildings whose appearance and fine mouldings might suggest considerable respect for accurate measuring. The lack of carved egg and dart or palmettes on the anta capitals is in keeping with the plain torus of the column base, in contrast with the elaborate inlays of the column capitals. The carved forepart of the anta capitals is symmetrical but for the depth of the cavetto moulding which on one side is cut off 0.08 shorter than on the other. The shorter side is perhaps the inside, so the capital drawn here should belong to the southern wall of the building. The restoration of the remainder of the anta is not easy. A lion's paw (19; fig. 39; plate 15 a-c) was found beneath one of the anta capitals built into the apse of the Basilica Church. Its material, execution, scale and style associate it closely with the other architectural pieces. 1 Reuther, op. cit., drawings Z23 and 31; these are Hellenistic but seem to copy the proportions of archaic bases of a type which would suit the earliest period of the building. If the base in Berlin (Shoe, Greek Mouldings pl. LXV.3; Reuther, 52 fig. 7) is one of the original bases for the second dipteron it shows that the half-round torus was still in use there. I have assumed that the marble bases at Phanai had this ovolo-like profile, Ant.J. xxxix (1959) 174 fig. 1. 2 From the Ãrtemision, Shoe, op. cit., pl. LXV.6. 3 Hogarth, op. cit., pl. 3.

The width of the anta face given by the top forepart of the paw is 0.735, which corresponds exactly with the wall thickness indicated by the anta capitals. Unfortunately the relationship between them as capital and base of the same member is complicated by the fact that just behind the claws the width of the lion's paw is lessened by 0.049 by a small vertical cyma moulding. This appears on one side of the block only, presumably the outside, so we have the northern paw. More difficult is the absence of this moulding on the fig. 40 Isometric reconstruction of anta capital (17), block (32), base (as 19). capitals. It may well have turned to delimit the animal element in the structure of the anta. Lions' paws on furniture and the like generally have rather complicated transitional mouldings above them to the legs, and with no more evidence at hand we may only suppose that such was true also of lions' paws used architecturally. That the anta face did not simply rise from the paw is also shown by the forepart of the top edge at the right of the paw which spreads somewhat beyond the line of the block below. The original edge here is missing, but it shows that some other carved block came immediately above it. The evidence of a probable anta block (32; fig. 44) suggests that the moulding in fact did return, or end abruptly. Even in the full classical period Greek architects could be strangely unsubtle in their treatment of the transition between one moulding and another. 1 Ant. J. xxxix (1959) 193-6.</page><page sequence="97">THE ARCHITECTURE 77 The forepart of this probable anta block (32) is 0.73 wide, which corresponds closely with the expected wall width. The recess at one side of it, which must have been filled by a separate block or moulding, further complicates the problem of the appearance of the face of the anta. A rectangular cutting and clamp at the rear of the block shows that another may have been set here to project at right angles. This would be for the porch wall, and gives us the depth of the anta from its face - 0.91. The breadth of the forepart of the block (0.73) compares well with the breadth of the forepart of the lion's paw (0.735) which is from the other anta. The depth of the forepart of the block is 0.325. That of the lion's paw before its vertical moulding is 0.31. The discrepancy in the blocks from different antae is not serious, and the recess on the side of 32 may have corresponded with the moulding on the lion's paw base. The carved cyma, which has been discussed above, has thus disappeared higher on the anta. The recession of the face does not appear on the sides of the anta capitals. The way in which such a block might relate to anta base and capital is shown in fig. 40. Another block, 31, fig. 44, shows how the wall thickness might be increased upwards by 0.018. The astragal moulding of a wall crown (20, see below) produces the same effect in a more natural manner. 33 might be from the porch wall rather than an anta. The Walls. There are four different blue marble mouldings which come from a curved wall with the radius of our apse. Two project at their upper edge with variant astragal mouldings (20, 22; figs, 43, 52). The other two are larger, but very fragmentary pieces, a cyma reversa (29; fig. 52), and an ovolo (30; fig. 52). Neither anta capital nor anta base suggests any straight mouldings running at the wall crown or base, but it is difficult to believe that there was none at all on a building of this type and it is quite possible that they stopped short of the main structural members of the antae. We have a superfluity of candidates for the positions. Either 20 or 22 could be wall crowns, topped perhaps by an ovolo like 30. l The cyma 29 might be a wall base. Other possible positions are in the entablature at the apse where considerable sim- plification of the corresponding members of the porch might be expected, but it is still not possible to assign certain places on the analogy of other, better preserved buildings of this period. The cutting of 23 suggests that the curve of the apse (if the block is to be sited there) was broken by a projection of some sort. 56 and 57 represent the more typical form of wall base met in many Ionic buildings, with a fluted half-round below an astragal. They are in white marble, however, and I am not sure that the colour contrast admitted by the architect in other parts of the building would be appropriate in this position. The width of the anta wall was shown to be 0.735. The main walls of the building would normally be slimmer, and one curved block which appears to preserve the full thickness of the walls gives us 0.62 (24) . A groove on its top runs 0.19 from its curved face and on the flat surface in front of the groove blocks like 22, 23 might easily have been set. Other fragmentary wall blocks with concave faces show that the inside of the walls was finished as carefully as their outside. 24 might be from the euthynteria at the apse. Some straight orthostat wall blocks with clamps in their upper edges might be from the temple (42) ; they give course heights of 0.42 and 0.48. With the measurements of other blocks they suggest pseudo-isodomic construction with alternating high (orthostat) and shallow (bonding) courses. Of the many other plain blocks of varying sizes (41) some might also belong 1 Hunt, BSA xli (1940-5) 37, mentions at Emporio *a whole pile of worked marble blocks ... all slightly curved, and apparently had formed a large circular structure which, to judge by the curvature, would be about 20 metres (sic) in diameter. . . . Some had a projecting cornice at the top with a tooth pattern beneath'. I cannot recognize the moulding described, unless it be a curved dentils and geison block (cf. 73, below). Hunt mentions late inscriptions on two of the blocks, similar to those found in the excavation.</page><page sequence="98">78 GREEK EMPORIO here but their variety suggests that other structures and no doubt other periods are represented. Some other carved blocks with clamps and recesses are most probably from the fifth-century temple but cannot be assigned with certainty (33-35; fig. 44). Entablature and other Mouldings. No part of the entablature can certainly be identified. There is, however, a white marble ovolo moulding which, from its scale and date (towards the middle of the fifth century), might be from the epistyle crown of the building (53; figs. 49, 50; plate 17). The difference of its material from that of the rest of the building is not an objection, as white marble inlays were used in the capitals, and the architects seemed to be conscious of the effect of colour contrasts. The moulding is carved with lotuses and palmettes, mocking egg and dart in a characteristically Chian manner. I have treated of its style and date elsewhere. í Only one small fragment was recovered from Emporio, built into the Basilica Church. Two other com- plete blocks can, however, be plausibly attributed to the same building, as they agree exactly in height and in carving, except for a detail of the lotus calyx which need have no significance whatever. One is built into the Panagia church between Emporio and Kalamoti. The other served as altar table in a church at Sikelia, north of Kalamoti, and is now in Chios Museum. d^ fig. 41 Isometric reconstruction of crowning (39) and base (37) mouldings. The full depth of the latter seems preserved; it is 0.78.2 They are all straight, and if this is the epistyle crown it may only have appeared at the façade, not at the sides or apse where it could have been replaced by a simpler moulding or mouldings. In the restored drawing, fig. 42, it is figured on the side of the building for convenience. Another white marble moulding is preserved with carved palmettes and volutes on egg and dart in the Chian manner (52; figs. 48, 49; plate 17). Too small for service as epistyle crown on a building of this size it might still have decorated its door, or served as a wall crown within the porch or cella. That elaborate internal mouldings of this sort were used in Chios is shown by an inside-corner moulding from Phanai with elaborated egg and dart and corner gorgon- eion.3 The style of 52 is appreciably older than 53, perhaps still of the first quarter of the fifth century.4 It is then probably better to assume that it decorated some other structure on the site. Nothing is known of the temple roof and no clay tiles can be attributed to it. 88-90, fig. 59, if indeed they are from white marble tiles, might conceivably belong. Altar. Wall crown and base mouldings can be attributed to an altar, probably the altar of the fifth-century temple. The crown (38-40; figs. 41, 52) is a flat fascia over a cyma reversa; the 1 Ant.

Stratigraphical evidence is completely lacking. The column capitals seem likely to be of the second quarter of the fifth century. The possible epistyle crown, on different and better stylistic grounds, seems more certainly near the middle of the fifth century in date. The swallow- tail clamps, with and without embola, make any date later than the fifth century improbable but the shape of the clamp holes cannot be a decisive factor since it recurs, though infrequently, in much later buildings. The other mouldings find their closest parallels in the first half of the fifth century, not early in it.

In general the second quarter of the fifth century seems indicated. The Setting of the Temple. The building was oriented to the east with its entrance facing the shipping entering the harbour. Between it and the harbour side there is no evidence for any major alteration in the system of terraces and approach since the new design of about 600 b.c. Thus the fifth-century temple must have been served, as was its sixth-century predecessor in the same place, by the path which ran below the terrace wall and turned up onto the sanctuary platform from the east, before the temple's door. There is evidence for some changes in the main terrace wall north of the temple where there are signs of a new terrace face at a slight angle to the old one and of house walls on the edge of the platform, probably of the sixth century and apparently even antedating the early 'circular' temple which has been described above. The similarity of the general setting, with regard to the terrace and platform, of the sixth- century temple with that of the later one makes the more remarkable their difference in level. The paving foundations of the earlier building lie about 1.10 below the level of the top of the foundations of the later. Yet we must assume that the level of the top of the terrace and platform remained the same. Ground level must then have been raised by well over 1 m. in the vicinity of the temple itself. It may be that this was effected by a built podium or platform in which the</page><page sequence="101">THE ARCHITECTURE 8l foundations were set. A considerable number of ashlar blocks carved in the local white sand- stone were used for the inner stylobate and outer wall base of the Early Roman Basilica (43; fig. 44; plate 140). Some of these blocks have their lifting bosses preserved. They might well have served as the facing for a temple podium. There is no place for them in the known system of terraces by the harbour nor do they seem to be taken from a free-standing building. An objection to this attribution of the blocks is that they were removed while the temple itself was still standing (see below) . This may not, however, have been impossible for the general ground level had risen enough in the intervening centuries for the Basilica floor to be at about the same ¿75 335 27 $-^ ¿75 *» &gt;H I ^ ^ &lt;&amp;/ 215 IL-v;^&lt;!l"|M1fhii I IT- ?

Podium temples are uncommon in Greece, but commoner in East Greece than elsewhere. The seventh-century temple of Old Smyrna stood on a podium-platform beside the city wall, 1 and there was a podium for the early sixth-century Aeolic temple at Neandria.2 The second dipteron at the Heraion on Samos had a raised stylobate giving the effect of a podium; it was begun in the third quarter of the sixth century. Finally, at Miletos, the temple of Athena which was built after the Persian Wars and must be a close contemporary of ours, was erected on a podium.3 1 JHSlxxi (1951) 248;lxxii (1Q52) 104 f. 2 Koldewey, Neandria 24 fig. 55 ; von Gerkan in Festschrift B.

Most of the preserved blocks and mouldings here attributed to the fifth-century temple and its altar were built into the Basilica Church in the second half of the sixth century a.D. That so much of the building has been recovered from the limited excavations of the scant remains of the church suggests that the temple may have been standing, or at least its ruins undisturbed, in the sixth century a.D. That it was certainly still standing in the third or fourth century a.D. is shown by the graffiti on some of the blocks which overlap their edges, showing that the stones were still in position. These graffiti appear on three mouldings attri- buted to the altar, and on one which may be from below the crown of the temple wall.1 The last may have been in a difficult place to inscribe but the letters were large, the wall not very high, the ground level may well have risen beside it, and it may have seemed worth his trouble to the writer. A complicating factor in this account of the later history of the temple is the presence of letters - mason's marks - on the corner capital and on the column base which was re-used in the Basilica Church. The letter forms are probably of one date, of the early centuries of our era; yet they cannot belong to the building of the Basilica Church since the capital was built into it, not re-used. Nor could they have been intended for the original Basilica for we have seen reason to believe that the main temple structure was intact in the first century a.d. The absence of a letter on the other complete capital may mean that the re-use, or rather reconstruction involved was only partial. But £ is 5, and there could have been only four column bases. The problem remains unresolved. Construction and Ground Plan. A number of peculiarities in the construction of the fifth-century building call for comment, notably its plan which, with that of its predecessor, is considered below. The clamped foundations themselves require explanation. In buildings of comparable size, and indeed in larger temples, clamps appear only in the first course of the foundations, if at all. Here three full courses are clamped. The architect must have been prompted to this excess of caution by the fact that the temple was not founded on bedrock but above earlier, shallow foundations, and in part on virgin soil. The temple stood near the harbour side, but certainly not in marshy ground. The island's liability to earthquakes may also have been a cautionary factor. Some variety of clamps and dowels is apparent throughout the temple structure. In the foundations there appear large swallow-tail clamp holes with flat bases. Straight-sided hook- clamps as well as swallow-tails with peg holes (embola) appear on wall blocks and other mem- bers. There are round holes for wooden pegs in a column drum, a capital and the only preserved base.2 The corner capital has no such cutting. The base has a pour channel also which may not be for its first use. Holes for vertical dowelling appear in some blocks and on the upper found- tions, a noteworthy feature at this date.3 Anathyrosis is general, but in addition there appears on some blocks a deep vertical groove running at the sides just behind the face (20, 22, 26; fig. 43). It also appears, horizontally, on a deep wall block (24; fig. 43), which shows that it can have nothing to do with the lifting of the stones. Its purpose is obscure and I do not know of comparable examples on Greek buildings. Chian blue marble, quarried just north of Chios town (Latomi) is the main material employed, but white marble inlays were used in the capitals and it seems probable that the 1 38-40, 20. Cf. D. W.

This deliberate colour contrastili the stones is met also at Phanai and on the Chian Great Altar at Delphi. Somewhat comparable contrasts in stone are found in Ionia at Old Smyrna at the end of the seventh century. Later the use of coloured, contrasting stone in architecture became more common, although in Greek buildings it was always discreet. 1 In the execution and size of many of the blocks there are a number of remarkable discre- pancies which argue both the work of different masons and the absence of detailed 'blue-prints' for the building. It is impossible to believe that the two preserved capitals are not of the same building - hard to believe that they are not of the same building period. Yet the differences between them have called for considerable comment already. There is a difference of nearly 1 ' per cent, between the width of the two anta capitals. In blocks of the presumed epistyle crown there is a slight variation in the treatment of the lotus calyxes. And in many other blocks and mouldings minor deviations from the strictly rectangular or parallel can be observed. The wall thickness, 0.62, corresponds with a basic East Greek measurement for two mudbricks, retained for wall construction in other materials.2 Such other dimensions as can be ascertained for the building defy any attempts at exact translation into Ionic or any other feet.3 The sixth-century temple was either circular or apsidal in plan; the fifth-century one was certainly apsidal. Buildings of this type are uncommon in Greece but can often be explained as imitations of primitive predecessors. Apsidal plans for Geometric temples are not unknown in mainland Greece.4 It might be argued that the Emporio temples' plans go back to that of earlier buildings on the site, of which there is no longer trace, were it not that some of the earliest houses of the Iron Age Greek occupation of the site are well-preserved and all have rectangular 'megaron'-type plans. Nor is there any suspicion of an apsidal or curved plan surviving in the Athena sanctuary on Prophètes Elias, which was no doubt one of the earliest foundations of the new settlement. A possible explanation is that the Greeks who re-settled Emporio came from the west at a time in which the rectangular plan was currently used for domestic construction, but apsidal temples were still visible and being built. At all events the appearance of a monumental columnar temple with an apse in the full classi- cal period remains an oddity. In the sixth century there is an apsidal temple on the Acropolis at Athens and minor apsidal shrines at 'Larisa', Corinth, Delphi and in the Athenian Agora,5 as well as the Bouleuterion at Olympia whose plan must have been determined by its function. On Paros, there are unpublished blocks and mouldings from a round, or apsidal temple of the fourth century b.c.6 Later Buildings. As well as the blocks and mouldings of the fifth-century temple the Basilica Church yielded many stones representing structures belonging to the later Classical, Hellen- istic and Early Roman periods. No foundations for the buildings were found and only in a few instances can more than one block or moulding reasonably be attributed to a single building. We cannot even be certain where the buildings stood, although the presumption is that they 1 On early colour contrast see Ant. J. xxxix (1959) 187.

The apsidal plan may be presumed to develop from the rectangular in Iron Age Greece, in which period the 'megaron' form need have no immediate relationship with the Mycenaean megaron (see above, p. 36).

The pottery of this period, from the fifth century b.c. to the first a.D., appears in different places on the site, nowhere in contexts indi- cating clear building or occupation levels. The only probable Early Roman structures preserved at Emporio are the Cistern, and the outlines of the Basilica, later converted to a Christian Church. Among the fragments from columns the complete absence of any shafts fluted in the usual manner is noteworthy. 58, fig. 54, plate 18, apparently from a capital without an abacus, has a convex channel in the archaic manner, and the centre front is carved with a relief palmette and perhaps a scroll. The convex channel and the style of the palmette suggest a date in the mid-fifth century, perhaps not far from that of the apsidal temple. But the material is white marble and the scale is much smaller. The floral device in this position is uncommon in the fifth century. It appears on a capital in Athens which has been mentioned already, and the disc rosettes on the Kavalla capitals may also be compared (see above, p. 72). Later the device is more common;1 earlier, it appeared on the Naxian capital on Delos (and probably at Delphi) and on some minor votive capitals. Other white marble volute fragments with carved palmettes may not be from capitals (61, 62; fig. 54; plate 18). Their palmettes suggest the fifth or fourth centuries. There is evidence also for an ornate type of white marble Ionic capital with relief floral decoration on the cushion side (59; fig. 53; plate 18). The tendril, which is all that is left of the floral, is reminiscent of the arrangement on a capital from Ephesos in the British Museum,2 and suggests a fourth-century or Hellenistic date. Fragment 60, fig. 59, from the cushion side of an Ionic capital, has the scotiae and double astragals of the Ephesian type, like those of the fifth-century temple. All these pieces, including the scraps of Corinthian capitals (63, 64; plate 18) suggest structures smaller even than the fifth-century apsidal temple. They may be from small shrines in antis, public buildings or even independent offerings. Of the other Ionic members preserved the most notable is the group of geison and sima blocks carved in the local white stone (71; figs. 56, 58; plate 18). The execution is good considering the material used. No clamp holes are preserved. The geison and sima are carved together on the same block, a regular practice in the second century b.c.3 No column fragments of this scale, period or material have been preserved, but 72, figs. 56, 58, may very well be part of a frieze block from the entablature of the same building. The only known building on the site which was of appropriate size for such an entablature is the apsidal temple of the fifth century. It will be remembered that no part of its entablature could be identified with complete certainty. The possibility at least must be admitted that this second-century entablature was in fact executed for the temple, which was perhaps unfinished or required extensive repair. The objections to this are that the discrepancies in execution, material and colour, let alone general style, seem too great even for a late Hellenistic provincial architect to contemplate. Yet, of course, the Heraion at Olympia suffered repeated, and in their way more contrasting innova- tions. In Samos additions and replacements to the second dipteron and the Great Altar closely copied the appropriate archaic models. In favour of the association is the fact that there exist no column members for the late entablature and no certain entablature for the early columns, antae and walls. Also, three of the relevant blocks were recovered from the apse of the Basilica Church, the source of most of the mouldings of the fifth-century building; this implies that these two groups of mouldings were equally accessible at this late date. A difficulty is that two of the geison blocks are associated with the building of the cistern which is probably Early Roman, 1 In Chios, at Phanai, BSA xxxiv (1933-4) pl. 3©*, and on a capital in Chios Museum, Ant.

The question must remain open. Of the other Ionic mouldings the most important is the white marble base block which had been converted in Late Roman times to use as a window pillar (55; fig. 51; plate 18). The decoration - leaf and dart, scotia and guilloche - is most carefully executed. The scheme appears on various Hellenistic structures, notably the Temple of Artemis at Magnesia on the Maeander,1 which is probably of the mid-second century b.c.2 Weickert has noticed that the centre rib of the leaf in the cyma moulding tends to become stylized to a flower by about this time, while the leaf itself is carved with deeper hollows.3 A peculiarity of our moulding is the arrangement of three deep-cut hollows at the base of each leaf - within the centre rib and on either side of it. This particular stylization is met again in Chios on two white marble mouldings of different sizes in Chios Museum which are carved with exactly the same scheme of decoration as the Emporio block.4 The complete absence at Emporio of white marble wall blocks shows that the architects were not averse to contrasts in material or colour. The blocks above this base moulding were most probably of the local white sandstone or of Chian blue marble. It is not impossible that it belongs to the same building as the entablature just described. Two other wall base mouldings (76, 77; figs 57, 58) are in Chian blue marble and lack carved decoration. They may be close ;n date to the white marble piece - second century b.c., but could be much later.5 To the latest Hellenistic period can be assigned the dentils, 73, fig. 56. The geison carved in the same block has been broken away. The execution is poor and the gaps between the den- tils are not cut right back but left with a sloping roof. Priene6 affords a close parallel, and the epistyle crown in the same entablature is so similar to our 78, fig. 58, that it seems likely that this may be from the same structure as the dentils. The later Hellenistic period seems thus to be one of renewed architectural activity at Em- porio. The first century A.D. is the next for which there is evidence of further building for it is then that the outlines of the Basilica were laid with the squared white stone blocks taken from some classical terrace or podium (43) . To this period may be referred most of the Doric mem- bers found. The blocks of a poorly executed entablature with triglyph frieze are also probably Early Roman (74, 75; fig. 57; plate 18). It may be that they are to be associated with the original Basilica, to which no other stone architectural members can be confidently assigned. Such is the unsatisfactorily incomplete evidence for the post-classical buildings at Emporio. The one notable architectural project of which we have adequate record is the final form of the Basilica Church (which has yet to be published) . But in the mouldings assembled here there is evidence enough for some variety of small monumental buildings on the site; buildings whose stones served the Late Roman masons either as material for walls or foundations, wherein they have been fortunately preserved, or as fodder for their lime-kilns. Even later the stones at Em- porio were further dispersed. Some were removed to modern buildings near by or to kilns, and at least three of the finely carved classical mouldings were carried several miles away to decor- ate late churches (see 52, 53 a, b) . In the light of this chequered history and the limited nature of the excavations it is not surprising that the architectural record of the site is so fragmentary and its interpretation so inconclusive. 1 Weickert, Das lesbische Kymation pl. 70; Humann and others, Magnesia am Maeander 75 fig. 67. 2 Dinsmoor, op. cit., 274. 3 Op. cit., 83. * They are somewhat more elaborate with a double strand in the guilloche.

To the west of the modern road inland from Emporio and about i .5 km. from the sea is the small church of A. Theodoroi. Half a kilometre away to the north-east is the site of the classical farmhouse at Pindakas excavated in 1954 and published in BSA liii-liv (1958-9) 295 ff. There are many worked blocks built into the church, mainly of the local white sandstone. There are unfluted column drums, and large limestone blocks like thresholds or door jambs (plate 18). One of these measures 1.64 x 0.45 x 0.22 and seems to have been re- worked for use in a press. None of these blocks is certainly earlier than the Roman period and they may all have been assembled here from another church in the valley. On the other side of the road and on the hill due south of Pindakas large worked blocks seem likely to be from a large building of Roman date. On the hill Metochi, ' km. north-west of Pindakas, there are remains of mediaeval buildings and tiles. In 1954 a number of large squared blocks of white sandstone were being unearthed and broken up. They did not lie in situ but had been built into some later structure. They were foundation blocks, similar to those of the fifth-century temple at Emporio, but certainly not from that building. Large swallow-tail clamp-holes appeared in many of the blocks and the owner of the property said that he had found lead in some of them. The maximum length of the blocks seen was 0.88. It seems likely that they had been used for the construction of a small church on the site, long since destroyed. Originally they must have been from a classical build- ing, like that at Emporio. That this may have stood at Metochi is suggested by the finds there of the fragment of an archaic marble kore and of an early sixth-century decorated sherd; also by the size of the blocks which few would have wanted to move far since antiquity. Farther to the north, towards Kalamoti, is a group of churches, most of them dedicated to the Panagia. In one was observed the moulding 530, and in the same church are other worked blocks including an egg and dart which might also be from Emporio.1 The niche above the door of another Panagia church here is framed by two small Ionic capitals whose cushion sides only are visible (plate 18). These are probably Early Roman and again may be from Emporio. There is no suggestion of any monumental buildings in the vicinity although the concentration of churches betokens a mediaeval village, now deserted. A strew of fine archaic pottery nearby is more probably from a cemetery than a sanctuary. CATALOGUE OF THE ARCHITECTURAL MEMBERS The present location of the pieces described is indicated as follows : (CM) in Chios Museum; (E) at Emporio, and visible, either built into later structures or exhibited beside and in the restored Baptistery of the Basilica Church; (EB) at Emporio and no longer visible, being reburied either loose or as found built into foundations and other structures (principally the Basilica Church) . The following stones were employed at Emporio as building material: Chian blue marble. A medium grain marble, occasionally rather grey, and often weathering to a blue-grey. It was quarried from a hill just north of Chios town (Latomi). The earliest known occasion for its use was for the door jambs of the Athena temple (above, p. 13) and in the fifth century it is used for walls and mouldings at Emporio and Phanai, and often later. White marble. Apparently little used, and only for the more elaborately carved mouldings. The earlier pieces are in a medium grain marble of clear white. It is not like a Greek 'island marble', nor is that of the early Chian sculptural remains, despite Pliny's remark that Chian sculptors used Parian marble (JVHxxxvi 14). Its select use suggests that it was either imported 1 Ant. J. xxxix (1959) 185 no. 38.</page><page sequence="107">THE ARCHITECTURE 87 or in short supply. There may well have been quarries on Chios, though none has yet been certainly identified. White sandstone. Quarried from Prophètes Elias hill, north of Emporio harbour. It is soft and easily cut, but weathers quickly and flakes readily. Freshly cut or worked it is a brilliant uniform white. White and yellow limestone. Probably quarried locally. I.

(EB) Plain blocks of Chian blue marble. Most of these were built into the Basilica Church and for many their complete dimensions could not be determined. Their finish is as that of the blocks which can certainly be attributed to the fifth-century temple, and it is probable that many of these stones are from the same building. Most seem orthostat blocks. Heights between 0.42 and 0.48 are the most frequent. H. W.

TOMBS AND OTHER FINDS No major cemetery area of the Archaic or Classical periods was identified. The ancient levels in the valley leading to the harbour, and so alongside the main approach road, are very deep below the modern surface. Farther from the harbour, where the lower hill slopes rise from the valley, isolated finds of pottery may well indicate tombs, but only one certain cemetery was found. 1. Following the discovery of decorated pottery on the surface, two fields at a point 500 m. south-west of Pindakas and south of the modern road to Pyrgi (fig. i), were trenched in 1954 and 1955- Beside and below an intervening field wall part of one grave was found; 1.25 m. of its length remained undisturbed beneath the wall. It was a simple cist with only its sides lined by rough upright slabs. The clear width within was 0.65 m. One small hydria of sixth-century type (823) was found standing in the preserved end of the tomb. Other trenches yielded no built tombs in the shallow disturbed soil, but many fragments of finely decorated vases of the sixth and fifth centuries and some plainer fourth-century wares, presumably broken grave goods.</page><page sequence="118">98 GREEK EMPORIO 2. On the other side of the valley, approximately i km. inland along the path leading up to the town where the path meets the valley, a cache of vases was excavated which may well come from a single tomb or pit. No structure was found. They comprise parts of three fifth-century Chian wine amphorae, a one-handler, a plain red amphora and a lamp (9212-3, 946; 505). 3. Near the Panagia chapel on the far side of Prophètes Elias from Emporio and on the .path to Kalamoti, a small strew of finely decorated sixth-century pottery was found (848, 850, 877) very probably from disturbed graves. It is improbable that these finds are from cemeteries belonging to the main town at Emporio, and they may easily be small family plots associated with isolated farm buildings - a pattern of life more easily observed in Chios in the Hellenistic period, but which could have been enjoyed already in the sixth century.</page><page sequence="119">PART II THE FINDS H</page><page sequence="120">INTRODUCTION The main sources are the deposits in the terraces by the Harbour Sanctuary and, on Prophètes Elias, the township and Temple of Athena. All the finds are in Chios Museum except for the coins which are in Athens. A note here summarizing the nature of the deposits, their contents and the interpretation of the chronology of the main periods may help the reader. Each of the main deposits of the Harbour Sanctuary (Periods I-IV) were the clearings from the temple area before a new period of construction. When it was a question of a completely new temple building as well as a new temple platform and terrace we may reasonably suppose that all the disposable offerings were removed. But we know nothing of the temple buildings in these periods, so it is possible that many earlier offerings were excavated in levels allotted to a later period. In some instances such survivors can be detected, but each terminus is decidedly a. post quern non, and I have here and there suggested that some classes of object or pottery went out of use before periods in whose levels stray examples were still found. There is no such confusion in the Athena Temple deposits. The main periods of the Harbour Sanctuary and of the Athena Temple are numbered separ- ately. The attribution of the excavated levels to the various periods and their dating are discussed above. I give below a tabular aide-memoire to the chronology proposed : Harbour Sanctuary Athena Temple Period Period I 690 I II 660 III 630 IV 600 V 550 VI II 500 325 III In the catalogue the following abbreviation is used : HS : Harbour Sanctuary The pottery from the site at Pindakas, near Emporio, and some other minor local finds are included here.

THE POTTERY In the catalogues the description of fabric has been omitted wherever it conforms to the normal Chian type. This is of a well-levigated pink or pale red clay, * which may fire with a greyish core. There are occasional white inclusions and rarely some mica. A coarser, gritty red fabric will be remarked in the description of several pieces; it appears again in the clay figurines (see p. 187). Slip is generally used. On the earlier vases it is a dull pale cream, but by the mid-seventh cen- tury a fine and heavy white slip with a good glossy surface is found on some vases, and in the sixth century this porcelain-like slip is in general use. All unusual variations of slip or fabric are noted, and the fabric of non-Chian vases, except Corinthian and Attic, is described. Significant measurements of complete vases are given where they can be accurately determined. It should be noted that the pottery from Prophètes Elias, both the town and the Athena Temple, was far more poorly preserved than that from the Harbour Sanctuary. Often all the decoration has disappeared. 1. THE EARLY VASES (HS PERIODS I-IV) Singe the pottery published here is virtually our only source of information about Chian wares of the eighth and seventh centuries it is appropriate that some general remarks be made about its character and about the features which distinguish it from that of other East Greek centres. The course of the development in shapes and decoration is generally slow but it is clear - the more clear for the stratification at Emporio. The following remarks will deal with generalities only. Detailed discussion of the various shapes will be found in the main part of the catalogue. I have not classified all the patterns met on Chian vases in this period and have concentrated on the most characteristic, as these may indicate more clearly what Chian taste approved. Technique. As on most other East Greek vases of this period slip is generally used. Through the seventh century the distinctive thick white slip appears with growing frequency on Chian vases, but for the first half of the century the slip is generally a paler dull cream. The clay is generally very clean, the paint black, red or brown. There was a short vogue for white-on-black decora- tion, on kantharoi and tall cups, in Periods I and II ; and on one oenochoe (537) the diamond pattern is unusually outlined in white. The interiors of the craters, the early chalices and the skyphoi which precede them are slipped and then painted : an unusual technique which seems to have been confined to Chios. Shapes. Stemmed craters with handles linked to the rim by a strap are most common. They are closely related to the series found in Rhodes and Samos, and to isolated examples found else- where in East Greece. In the disposition and choice of decoration - for instance the Ss and dots at the rim, they are, however, readily distinguished from those of other centres. The straight lips are closer to Samos than to Rhodes. They were, it seems, still being made towards the end of the seventh century but never admit Wild Goat decoration as do the Samian. Skyphoi with metope patterns are a commonplace in Chios and Samos, not rare elsewhere in East Greece and the islands, but in Chios they led to the distinctive chalice shape. At the end of the seventh century 1 Like some of the better Rhodian clays (without the mica), or Attic or Euboean fabrics of the eighth and seventh centuries.</page><page sequence="122">THE EARLY VASES 103 the typical form of the latter is with a high straight wall, shallow lower bowl, and a low splaying foot. The shape is confined to Chios and does admit Wild Goat decoration. For the later history of the shape, from the sixth century to the Hellenistic period, see pp. 172 f. A graphic summary of the sequence is shown in fig. 60. On the other skyphoi two patterns seem more favoured here than elsewhere : the single wavy line upright between bars, and 'metopes' with crosses and zigzags. The eggshell cups (197, 198) are notable precursors of the fine-walled chalices. Of the cups our types C and D are common to most other parts of Greece. Type E, with the inward-leaning walls, is peculiarly Chian. B, with the splaying or straight walls and sharp corner of the foot (sometimes bevelled) is met in Samos, but the tall cups, A, are again wholly Chian. Some are large vases but their Geometric and Subgeometric decoration is rather commonplace. Technically they are exceptionally fine vases. The plain stemmed dishes with lugs and the late, flatter dishes with the fine glossy slip are also especially Chian; and the lekanai with a heavy foot and striped decoration are a peculiarly Chian version of a popular island type fig. 60 The evolution of the chalice (not to strict scale), (a) late eighth century; (b) early seventh century; (c) mid-seventh century; (d) late seventh century; (e) early sixth century; (f) classical. of dish or plate. The island made its own bird-bowls after the Rhodian pattern, and related bird- oenochoai, but the latter are more individual in their patterning and they have trefoil lips, unlike the more usual round mouths of the Rhodian and Samian vases. The amphorae and hydriae with simple linear patterns are met all over East Greece, but the forms developed late in the seventh century are only Chian, and their decoration survives in the sixth century on the wine- jars. Belly-handled amphorae are most common in Mainland Greece, but quite rare in the east, and their popularity and variety in Chios are notable. Some Chian oenochoai have pear- shaped bodies and appear to be a local type. The other oenochoai, as those with birds, just mentioned, are closer to the usual East Greek forms, as are the small one-handled jugs. In plain pottery the one-handled pitchers may be singled out, but they appear often in Mainland Greece and, to a lesser extent, in the east. There are not enough 'Ionian cups'" for us to suspect a Chian factory for them. The bucchero may be imported, perhaps from Lesbos, but there could well have been Chian bucchero. The imitation of an Etruscan bucchero form (216) is noteworthy. Decoration, fig. 61 . Some patterns may be pointed out : Ss and dots or 'broken cable' (A) ; common enough elsewhere, but excessively common on Chios, especially on rims and lips. The pattern is almost the rule on crater rims, in a strip near the rim of tall cups and on lekane rims. It also appears beside other patterns in the main decorated field of craters and other vases. About the</page><page sequence="123">104 GREEK EMPORIO middle of the seventh century it is often bounded by broad groups oí close-set parallel lines (B) - on craters and the growing walls of the early chalices. These groups of thin lines are also often found alternating with broad painted bands (C), especially on the larger closed vases and in the lekanai. The rhythm is a popular Geometric one elsewhere but was long favoured in Chios. The thin lines may sometimes be executed as a spiral, in the Cypriot manner, and not as indi- vidual hoops as on most other Greek vases. There is a great variety of diamond patterns. That with triangles at the apices (D) fills panels on craters and oenochoai. Chains, upright or horizontal (E, G) are also common on these vases and others, occasionally with hooks (F) like the hook- growths on the 'Rhodian trees' which are found on bird-bowls etc. (e.g. 437). The chain alter- nately hatched one way and stippled (H) is late, on chalices. Of the triangular motifs we find the HH %Á¥i YW Ä X G H J D E F MA %® i ■ *Msm K L M N ° P Q R S T U V W X FIG. 6l pendent hatched Vs (J) either singly as side panels on craters and oenochoai, or in rows, and ordinary hatched triangles appear often in rows, upright or horizontal, sometimes pendent. The rows of triangles hatched one way (K) are late (cf. H), on lekanai and chalices, and they are sometimes pendent. The use of J, K (and H) seems peculiarly Chian.1 Z^zags are of course common, but especially in carefully drawn strips with double or triple lines (L, M); these appear most often on craters and some cups. Chequers, on craters, oenochoai and some cups, often have dotted blanks (N), and on a bird-oenochoe (548) the blanks have outline squares in them. The dotted blanks appear on Samos but are none too common elsewhere.2 Maeanders, swastikas and key patterns appear in a great variety of forms which need not be detailed. Sometimes the patterns are in outline only (49), or painted in single lines (64, 75, 303). Cross- hatching is rare. The outlined swastika on 94 and the spiral-maeander on 93 are noteworthy. The step pattern with bars in the bays appears on Chian bronze belts (see pp. 214 if.). 1 K is seen much earlier on the oenochoe, Exochi, 41 figs. 81-82. 2 Samos; e.g. AM liv (1929) 11 ff., figs. 2.9, 10, 11, 18, Beil. 1.1; lviii (1953) 106, fig. 48.

The butterfly pattern (O) appears below the main panels on craters, sometimes on chalices (245, 260), and a taller version of the butterfly may appear at the edge of panel compositions on craters or oenochoai (P), sometimes cross-hatched (66, 98). The smaller butterflies may be hatched (66, 98, 191), once stippled (156Z)). On skyphoi the commonest metope patterns are the single plump wavy line (QJ and crosses and zigzags (R) . The rows of Vs executed with a multiple brush to look like zigzags (S) are most often met on craters and many other shapes, especially the skyphoi which develop into chalices, and the motif is remembered in the handle zone of chalices until the mid sixth century.1 Rows of concentric circles (T) appear still throughout the seventh century on craters and lekanai, and we meet the unusual pattern of a cluster of compass-drawn concentric circles (U) on an oenochoe (543) and a cup (326), recalling Cypriot and Phrygian usage. Another curvilinear motif is formed by arcs (V; 45) and may sometimes be conceived as an hour-glass pattern (195, 196). On the plainer closed vases we find S loops (W) and 'moustaches', sometimes with the concentric circles beneath them (X) . These appear often on such vases in East Greece and are still used on sixth-century Chian wine-jars. The close resemblance to Late Mycenaean patterns can hardly be fortuitous.2 Human figure decoration appears only on craters (see pp. 108 f.) where there are also animals. The birds on these and other vases are the usual East Greek Subgeometric stock. Finally we may note the rare use of stippling - on diamonds (H), butterfly (156Z)), hour-glass (195, 196) and maeander and key patterns (208, 21 1).3 This is also a feature of Geometric vases in Aeolis.4 The general character of this decoration is in keeping with what we have come to expect of East Greece but some distinctively Chian patterns or Chian uses of patterns can be picked out, and with the mass of material now available a fair idea can be got of Chian Geometric decora- tion in the eighth and seventh centuries. There is much like it on Samian vases but the two are easily distinguished, and the differences from Rhodian are even more readily marked. These relationships can be traced best in the long series of craters. In North Ionia and Aeolis the com- parative material is scanty but the principles of decoration are very much as the Chian although the execution is seldom of the same quality. Some classes of 'Aeolic' decoration are especially close, notably those with rather sparse Ss and dots and other simple patterns. These are met on Lesbos, and at Troy, and there are related vases on Samothrace.5 CRATERS 1-137 (plates 19-28) Craters were the commonest of the larger vase dedications in the Harbour Sanctuary in each of Periods I to IV. Over a hundred vases are represented by the fragments listed here, from 1 Cf. Antiquity xxxiv (i960) 89. 2 They are related to the wave-line vases picked out by Hanfmann (in The Aegean and the Near East 176-82). The wave-line on the necks of these vases is not their most dis- tinctive feature. At least, there are many vases without the wave-line which are obviously very closely related. Hanf- mann minimizes their relationship with Bronze Age forms, but it cannot be chance that unites several different motifs in the same way on vases of the same shape. A Mycenaean amphora and hydria from Emporio demonstrate this very well. The continuity in the history of this early pattern can be traced with difficulty through the intervening centuries in various places in Greece, but the way that the combination of motifs and shapes seems to come full circle again in the seventh century is most odd. It may be that in East Greece there were communities still using Submycenaean shapes and decoration when Geometric Greeks arrived. 3 Phanai, BSA xxxv (1 Q34.-0 dIs. qci.22. d6a.2. 4 Gf.

By way of contrast there were only three fragments from the Athena Temple, and two spouted craters from the houses on Prophètes Elias. The shape varies little through the long series and the decoration remains Geometric or Sub- geometric to the end : a conservatism noticeable in other vase shapes. As a result no very clear- cut sequence can be established, although several trends can be picked out. Fabric and paint. The usual Chian archaic fabric is the most common, but in several pieces, mainly of Periods I and II, there is a gritty red clay which is met in other early vases and some figurines. The paint is generally red or brown, becoming more often a good black with Period II. The slip is cream, often pale, and very rarely is it entirely omitted. fig. 62 Restored crater, 35. Scale 1 : 4. Shape. There are three main types of lip in Periods I and II: short and shallow, as 35; taller and strongly concave on the outside with a slightly overhanging rim, as 73; thin and straight, generally leaning in somewhat, as 10. With Period III we find more upright lips with little or no overhang or thickening, and in Period IV several lean out at a sharp angle from the shoulder, as 85. In general the lip becomes taller and turns out more as time passes, but there is considerable variety in the forms. Warts or mastoi - unhappy physical descriptions of what is not necessarily an anthropomorphic feature - appear very rarely on the lip at either side of the handle; once there are two (53) ; once there is one on the shoulder (92) ; and compare the protrusion on the rim of 29. The handles are single horizontal loops on either side of the body with straps rising from their centres to the rim of the bowl. The spouted craters have no such straps. Conical or splaying feet seem the rule, but there is an occasional light or heavy ring base (33, 113). No base was with certainty attributed to an upper part, but the profile given in fig. 62 must have been typical of most.</page><page sequence="126">THE EARLY VASES 107 Imports. A small group of fragments (136, 137) must be dissociated from the main Chian series for their fabric, choice of motifs and general appearance. They may be Samian. Decoration. The interiors are almost always painted over the slip but there are a few examples slipped only within, or striped like bowls. The top of the rim normally has groups of cross-bars. The commonest pattern on the lip is a frieze of Ss and dots enclosed in lines, and this appears in all periods. Double rows of this pattern are rare. Next most common is a multiple brush 45 39 jfttMIII jl'O'y^y^ II |l|| #^ c* r» tf* f* ^ C* ^ f* /? f" f*f* C" llllll *****^ Illl Kuu^. jCtffll II 1 1^1 K/ tbIHII ******* II Illl ^ ^»&gt;» *+*+ *m j**+.j+ *»*»^» *»*»*»*»!

Other motifs here are dots, wavy lines, zigzags, hatched key or mae- ander patterns. On the narrow sloping ledge between lip and shoulder we find oblique or straight lines in Periods I and II, zigzags or diamonds in any period. The main decoration lies between the handles and is repeated on both sides of the vase. This is usually arranged symmetrically in upright panels but in Periods I and II the centre piece may be filled with horizontal friezes. The decorative schemes of three examples are restored in fig. 63. All the</page><page sequence="127">io8 GREEK EMPORIO patterns which appear on the craters are found already in Periods I and II, but some seem to have had a special vogue at certain times. The diamond-and-triangle trees (as 35) are most popular in Periods I and II. The hatched hooks and maeanders, diamond chains with or with- out hooks (as 6, 38) are also less often met in the later periods. Cross-hatching is early (13, 31). None of these patterns calls for special comment. Chequers appear in all periods; on two exam- ples (of Periods III and IV) the blanks are dotted. The metope pattern, and Ss and dots, as on the lips, also have a long life. Less common are the filled diamonds and triangles on 54 (Period II), which recall contemporary Protocorinthian, Protoattic and Island patterns; the segments on 45 (Period II), which are almost Protogeometric in spirit; and the 'trees' on 96 (Period IV). Concentric circles are met in Periods II-IV. Below the main decorative panels there is often a ,20 ^-7 127 ^^^ * fig. 64 Figure-decorated fragments. X is from Phanai. Scale 2 : 3. band of butterflies and bars encircling the vase. The lower part of the body may be mainly either clay-ground or painted, with narrow painted or reserved stripes respectively. Rays appear only once, with a ring base (113). The conical or splaying feet are generally only striped, sometimes grooved, and rarely with a decorative frieze also.1 From their manner of decoration some groups can be isolated and attributed to individual workshops or hands. These are 20-25,34-38,39-42,66-72,73-74. Figure decoration is met most often in Periods I and II. The forms are distinctly Geometric and very closely matched on fragments from Phanai (BSA xxxv (1934-5) pl. 35) to which I will refer in the discussion here. I add also an unpublished fragment from the same site (fig. 64 x).2 Horses have spiky manes (119) and angular legs - impossible as forelegs (123; cf. Phanai, pl. 35.29, 34 and fig. 64 x) . Warriors have a spiky long crest to their helmets (120, 122 ; cf. Phanai, pl. 35.30). At Emporio one wields a spear (119) ; at Phanai (pl. 35.33) a spear against a lion; and at Phanai warriors carry round (pl. 35.28, cf. 33) or miniature Dipylon (fig. 64 x) shields. 1 As on Samos, ^Mlviii (1933) 104, fig. 45 g, i. 2 This will be the Varrior on a prow* described by Kourouniotes, ADeltii (1916) 200.</page><page sequence="128">THE EARLY VASES 109 Only the Phanai lion-fighter might have some mythological identity. We have also silhouette birds (112, 114, ? 125; cf. Phanai, pl. 35.34, 36) and goats (124; cf. Phanai, pl. 35.31). There is a warship at Emporio (126, and cf. 120) - a miniature, resembling the Dipylon ships - and perhaps part of a boat at Phanai1 (pl. 35.20). The snake on 39 had added white dots, as on the shields of the Phanai warriors (pl. 35.28). In a later style are the hatched bodies of birds (?) on 88 and the outline head of a hawk on 128. From these pieces it seems that Geometric figure-scenes were perhaps commoner in Homer's island than on Samos or Rhodes, but there were certainly no ambitious compositions. The crater fragments from Phanai are from the same potteries which supplied Emporio. Among them (loc. cit., pls. 34-36) we may pick out some patterns not represented here: at the lip tooth-pattern (pl. 35.1), and circles (pl. 35.6, 15); elsewhere, concentric circles with quar- tered cross-hatched centre (pl. 35.5), hooks with dotted fill (pl. 35.9, 16, 22), and compare the rare tree pattern (pl. 35. 13), as on our 96. Outside Chios the closest parallels for these craters are to be found in the other East Greek states. Johansen has studied those from Rhodes,2 which are very close to the Chian ones in their shape and their single handles with straps. Their repertoire of patterns is, however, very different, and we do not meet the upright straight lips, although the shallow thick ones are very like the earliest in Chios. The earliest Rhodian craters bear the marks of the influence of Attic or Island vases of the mid-eighth century. The earliest Chian may not go back so far but they own the same ultimate inspiration, and the horizontal friezes in some panel composi- tions certainly derive from this period of Late Geometric. On Samos we find very similar profiles but the patterns are different, as is their disposition in panels.3 In particular we miss the Ss and dots at the rim. Isolated examples from Myrina and Kyme4 are in a different style again, rather closer to Rhodian. Closer are fragments from Old Smyrna5 and Miletus.6 One from 'Larisa' has warts like some of our fragments.7 The fragments are here arranged in order of level but I have kept together some small stylistic groups (see above), and displaced some pieces from late levels whose profile and/or decoration demand an earlier association. Fragments of feet and handles, spouted craters, figure-decorated fragments, and the few pieces from Prophètes Elias and the Athena Temple are also kept together. 1*. HS:H, Period I.

It belongs to a well-known class which was probably manufactured in the northern Cyclades, Euboea and Thessaly. * Various considerations suggest a date for most of these vases before 750 b.c., but they may have remained in use, and, in places, in production for some years later. Thus, they are rare in East Greece, and of the three other places where fragments have been found, in two they are accompanied only by slightly later Greek pottery (Larisa, Troy) .2 The kotyle 159 is apparently a unique Chian imitation of a familiar Protocorinthian shape. Rhodes made somewhat similar imitations.3 The other skyphoi fall into fairly well-defined classes. One type, with metope patterns, will be considered below with the early chalices which are its successors. A popular class has groups of six or seven vertical lines (multiple brush) divided by single upright wavy lines (160-164). The lips are striped. The fabric is good, Chian, but slip is not often used. The shallow, barely offset lip of 164 must be considered the earliest form, but it is not certain that any of the skyphoi are of Period I. Most are of Period II, and the fragments from levels of Period IV need not mean that the type survived in production for so long. The next most popular scheme of decoration for the handle zone is of Xs (sometimes filled, opposed triangles) and zigzags between the usual vertical multiple brush lines (166-172). Fabric and lip are as in the last class, but some are certainly of Period I, and again the type probably did not survive Period II. A variant has dots at the rim and admits birds to the me- topes (177-179) and zigzags or Ss may also be found at the rim. The multiple brush dot-and- squiggle on 174 appears only once. Some of these patterns appear on Samian skyphoi but in 1 The latest list, by Buchholz, in Berliner Jb. v (1965) 224-31; adding Lefkandi in Euboea and cf. BASOR 166 (1962) 15 (Sardis). 2 Lansa am Hermos iii pl. 57.4; Troy iv fig. 303.8; the class is represented at Phocaea but the circumstances have yet to be published. At 'Larisa' the vase could have arrived before the site was wholly taken over by the Greeks from the natives, c. 700. At Troy the re-settlement happened appre- ciably earlier than the date (700) given by the excavators. This is shown by the early bird-bowls if nothing else. The non-intersecting semi-circles (at 'Larisa' and Troy) may be a sign of lateness. On the Tarsus finds see now JHS Ixxxv(i965)9,232. 0 Lit. hxochi 121; and an example in the Louvre with water birds, and with white-red-white hoops within.</page><page sequence="137">Il8 GREEK EMPORIO general they are quite different or are differently grouped. * Other Geometric patterns on skyphoi are few and not remarkable. The curvilinear motifs on 195, 196 are in the same spirit as the filled arcs on the crater 45. 197 and 198 are unusual and important pieces. Their fabric can fairly be called egg-shell for its fineness. The slip is heavy and good, the paint lustrous, and added white is used by the handles. They represent an early (Period I/II) Chian experiment which has no sequel, for even the best of the sixth-century chalices are thicker in the walls. The only ancient pottery which I have handled that compares with them for this fine technique is Middle Minoan 'Kamares' ware.2 157*. fig. 72. HS:H, ? Period I. Rim diam. c. 0.20.

The black bucchero is represented by all-over painting. This imitation of a poorer foreign ware is quite unexpected here, but it appears that the bucchero kantharos shape was imitated in other parts of the Greek world also in the sixth century.2 fig. 73 Scale 1:3. 199*.

The levels at Emporio enable us to trace the shape back into the eighth century, to a familiar Late Geometric type of skyphos which the Chian potter then proceeded to develop in his own way. At the very beginning we may note the heavy slip used on these skyphoi - proto-chalices, we might call them. The multiple-brush metope patterns 1 AMlviii (1933) 91 ff. 2 cf Courbin in.BC//lxxvii (1953) 339 ff.</page><page sequence="139">I2O GREEK EMPORIO on them survive in the handle zone as long as chalices are painted, to the mid-sixth century. The earliest, which are really ordinary skyphoi, have low striped lips, and on the body groups of vertical lines and of zigzags executed with a multiple brush of from 7 to 9 members. This sort of decoration on this shape is common to many Greek wares.1 Already in Period II the lip is becoming higher and is decorated with more parallel lines, and the same trend is continued in Period III, with the depth of the body becoming less in proportion. Amid the lines on the high lip may now appear a row of Ss and dots, as on the lips of contemporary craters. Less often a zigzag is introduced, and rarely the metope pattern as on the body. However, the simple band of parallel lines remains the most common lip pattern. With Period IV the lip becomes higher still2 and now too a low conical foot becomes a regular feature, probably inspired by cups like our Type A, or 'Ionian cups'. More variety is introduced in the lip patterns, and we find some panels, of lines and Ss and dots, carried across both lip and handle zone. More ambi- tious patterns also appear, like those on oenochoai: notably rows of hatched triangles, lozenges, four-star rosettes. But there are also some plain vases which proclaim the potter's pride in the manufacture of such elegant thin- walled cups. Nikesermos, the first Chian potter we know by name, signed one such chalice, 251. Figure-decoration of the contemporary Wild Goat style is found - birds, goats, a bull and a boar. 272 in particular well illustrates the way in which the shape was used to display the full repertoire of East Greek orientalizing patterns. Nikesermos' shop also provided chalices of this type, 270. In the now much narrower handle zone the metope pattern is still found, but there may alternatively be palmettes by the handles with dot rosettes or cable pattern between. The open cable pattern is rather a challenge for a mediocre or impatient artist, and the painter of 261 soon despaired. The lower part of the body is usually striped, often with spiral bands, and may sometimes be painted all over. The interior is always painted over the slip, as is the outside of the foot. The later history of the chalice will be told below (pp. 1 56 ff., 1 72 f.) . The form which we met in Period IV does not survive into the sixth century, and the new type with higher foot and walls is not represented at all in Period IV levels, so the change in shape probably happened about 600. Early chalices are rare outside Chios but there are very early specimens at Tarsus and Smyrna.3 From the end of the century there is a decorated example at Tocra, plain examples at Athens, Tocra, Naukratis and Cerveteri, and scraps at Al Mina and Istria.4 The finest are the two from Vulci, now in Würzburg, decorated in the full Wild Goat style. The panel decoration over the handles of these is as on our 272. There are fragments from Naukratis in this style, and one fragmentary chalice from Catania5 which shows the transition to the sixth-century shape still with the old scheme of decoration, from a deposit with no datable vases earlier than about 600 b.c. Nikesermos calls the shape a kylix on 251. The term is a pretty general one for 'cup', but in his pottery this was, it seems, the name for the chalice, and other drinking vessels may have been differentiated by other names.6 1 Boardman, Antiquity xxxiv (i960) 85-89; for Samos cf. AM liv (1929) Beil 5.6; lviii (1933) 64 fig. 10. * Much the same process may lie behind the development of the Laconian cups known as lakainai at about this time, but there can be no direct connection between them and the Ghian chalices. 3 Tarsus iii fig. 1 01. 1499; BSA lx (1965) 140 fig. 190. * Agora vm pl. 13.230; Tocra 1 nos. 771-2; Naukratis 1 pl. 1 0.1, 3; Lerici, Nuove Testimonianze (i960) 46 in a tomb (352) on Monte Abbatone with nothing later than Early Corinthian pottery; JHS lx (1940) 9, fig. 4k; Istria, un- published. 5 Boll. d'Arte i960, 255 fig. 14 below. 6 Richter and Milne, Shapes and Names 24 f., cite examples of kylix applied to Attic b.f. and r.f. cups; and cf.

They can be divided into five groups by shape. A. Tall cups (¡284-320) These are most common in all periods. They have a low conical ring foot, straight or slightly splaying walls, and single handles which are usually straps but may be twin-reeded. Some early examples have a slightly offset rim. All are painted within, over the slip. The characteristic profile and decoration is established already in Period I. The decoration is generally confined to a reserved panel with horizontal friezes of Ss and dots, and occasionally zigzags ; but other Geometric motifs may be admitted and there are sometimes vertical friezes, usually Ss and dots again. There is usually a group of reserved lines low on the wall. A little more variety of decora- tion appears in Periods II and III, notably the bird on 313, and the Ss and dots may not have survived Period II on this shape. Multiplication of parallel lines, as on other Chian vases, is a feature of Period III. In Period IV stripes only are almost the rule and the cups are smaller, but we now meet also a different scheme of decoration, clay-ground without the reserved panel, and with a group of painted lines low on the wall (e.g. 320). A small group of Periods I and II is painted all black with decoration in white (298-302) and inside are slipped over the paint; the same technique appears on the kantharoi, 199-204; the patterns are as on other tall cups. The type seems wholly Chian. An example from Tarsus1 may be Chian, a fragment from Al Mina may be of this shape,2 and some vases in Aeolis are related.3 B. Cups with straight or splaying sides (321-345) These have flat bases and are generally much smaller than the tall cups of Type A. They are also often rather coarse in construction. Sometimes so much clay was left at the bottom of the wall that it was pared off to give a bevelled edge. In general the straight-sided cups seem later, of Period IV. The handles are simple straps, and most of the cups are painted within over the slip although there are some slipped only, and of these some are striped also. The commonest decoration, especially of the Period IV cups, is of stripes only, usually low on the wall. Of the other common Chian patterns the concentric circles appear, and the rows of triangles. 327 has the singular representation of ducks and ducklings, the latter apparently shown swimming in a somewhat impressionistic manner. 328 was by the same hand. None of this shape is certainly of Period I and very few of Period II. The shape is met also on Samos, where the decorative scheme is quite different,4 and at Naukratis.5 C. Cups with high concave upper walls and full rounded bodies (346-367) These have flat bases and strap handles. There is a variety of forms within this general pattern. The usual range of Chian patterns is found, but a simple design of stripes is most common in all periods, and almost the rule in Period IV. Many are also striped within, over the slip. 362 is the most elegant with close-set stripes in thinned paint. Its profile is close to that of the early chalices. The dotted chequers on 355 appear on the Chian craters. 1 Tarsus iii fig. 109.1636. -J/*yix(i94o)9,hg.4&lt;;. 0 In the Troy G2-3 ware cited above, p. 105, n. 5; and, for the general body shape, the carchesia (Love, in Essays K.

Low cups with shallow offset lips and flat bases (368-381) Some have a spiral stripe within. Not the commonest form at Emporio, but they are found from Periods II to IV. Only one is decorated with anything other than horizontal stripes. E. Cups with inward leaning walls (382-389) The broad bases are flat. This is a distinctive group which seems most popular in Period II. The decoration is generally sparse, with one or two wavy lines, or stars, but two have familiar Geometric motifs. The decoration and shape may asrain be matched in Aeolis.1 |^_ y/J ^^^^^^^^^^^V7 316 r-===:' 284 i^^W /^ p1 V' 29b 319 jHElI^ 32° jl^^^ fig. 75 Scale 1:3.

Most of the examples are notable for their thick glossy white slip, which, together with the absence of decoration, make them most like plain modern china in appearance. Two only have painted centre-pieces within, and there is the occasional stripe. All are of Period IV. With them may be compared the Early Corinthian 'stemmed lekanai' (MC 297, fig. 133) which also have a moulded lip, unlike the Rhodian stemmed dishes. 390*. fig. 79. HS:H, Period III.

They regularly have ribbon handles with projecting ends and low feet. The main decoration of the body and interior is of broad stripes with a spiral band in thinned paint between them, to give the impression of concentric hoops. On the rim outside the commonest patterns are the familiar Ss and dots within lines and multiple brush wavy lines, but a spiral band and hatched triangles are also found. 428 has concentric circles in the bands both inside and outside, and 429 has plastic rings beneath. Two examples are of Period I/II but the rest are all of Period IV, and the shape does not survive the seventh century. It is notable that the paint is often fired red on these vases. The deep form is like the Early Corinthian bowls (JVC 297, fig. 132) ; the shallow derive more directly from platters which were particularly common in the islands and East Greece, but do not have the heavy ring bases.1 412.

The earliest, with four panels and butterflies-and-lines in a strip below, is represented by fragments with hatched diamonds, the 'Rhodian tree', and vertical zigzags. On one frag- ment only is part of the vertical bars of the strip below preserved (440). We have no birds. These are all of Period I. Few other dated examples are known, but one from Asine3 is from a site which seems to have been destroyed about 700 b.c., and there is one in Rhodes with a Cypriot vase.4 There is a good variety of this type from Delos,5 including one poor example with the later three-panel scheme.6 1 Cf. Exochi 142 f. for this shape in East Greece; and especially A Aflviii (1933) 125, Beil. 37, for Samos. 2 JHS lx (1940) 14. I discuss problems of dating and the Tarsus finds in JHS lxxxv (1965) 5-7. The discussion here is confined to datable examples of whatever fabric and their relationship to the Chian series. 0 Asine, 321, hg. 219.4. ^ Litara luioaos 111, 99 ng. 92; lDia. 105, ng. 99 is iar out 01 context with a Middle Corinthian amphoriskos. There are fragments from Al Mina from levels of the eighth century. They are thick- walled, but the strip beneath the panels is not preserved. 5 EADélos xv pl. 46.4; 47.13, 14. 6 EADélos xv pl. 47.11; ibid., 15 is all black below the panels.</page><page sequence="152">THE EARLY VASES 133 In the next stage, our Period II, the lip is a little shallower, there are only three panels (diamond, bird, diamond) and the strip below has a zigzag of crosses. The same zigzags (and butterflies) appear below the main friezes of the related bird-oenochoai of this period (545-559). This type with the zigzag is also early, and appears with the four panels still at Ischia1 before the end of the eighth century (Nestor's cup), but it also begins to admit the three-panel scheme, as at Emporio and on several examples from Delos.2 On many of these earlier bird bowls the birds have outlined bodies. A fragment with the same profile as the early cups but only horizontal friezes of zigzags and Zs (445) can be placed here.3 The scheme resembles that of Protocorinthian kotylai, which may have inspired the shape. In our Period III the lip is still shallower, the birds' bodies have lost their outline and the zigzag strip has become a row of vertical or oblique dashes. There is an example from Tarsus4 from a slightly earlier context than the dates we have assigned to Period III. Finally, in examples from levels of Period IV, the lip is no more than a groove, the panel with the bird widens, the bird is elongated, the fill (a small circle appears now) is sparser, and in the strip below the dashes are replaced by simple dots. The whole body is now much shallower and the tendency throughout the series is for the bowl to open out and become much flatter, producing a wider central panel for the bird, the walls to thin, while the nick at the lip gradually disappears and the ring-base is replaced by a disc-foot. But it would be wrong to consider the dot-rows simply a degeneration of the rows of dashes. The dots appear on one of the early four-panel bowls on Samos,5 and on one from Ithaca6 it is the dots which seem to be degenera- ting into dashes. The dots are sometimes drawn large and bold, and there are several indications that they appear on three-panel bowls before the mid-century.7 Our two complete examples (448, 449) with a very shallow profile must come quite late in the series which does not, I imagine, survive much (if at all) into the last quarter of the century. The decorative strip of dots may also now be omitted. The area below the panels is filled with either void rays (as our 452} or is completely painted. The type with the rays is found often in Early Corinthian contexts.8 The type which is simply painted below the panels has much the same range, but may start earlier.9 The void rays also appear below groups of fine triple lines (453) or the same triple lines may fill the wall (454) . The interiors now often carry red and white stripes, and all semblance of a lip is gone. These lead to the rosette- and eye-bowls of the 1 RendLincx (1955) 216-8, figs. 1-3, pls. 1-4 (but no bird) ; REA lxvii (1965) 301-5, pls. 16, 17. * KADelos xv pl. 40.0-9; 47.10 (ibid., 12 has the earlier four-panel scheme) . The change from the four-panel scheme may have happened about 700. 3 For the scheme cf.

The series on Delos (EADélos xv pl. 47.24, 26; 48.28) shows the variety in depth of bowl which suggests a fair range in date. 8 Certainly with nothing earlier than LPG; see JHS lxxxv (1965) 7. There are other varieties of these bowls. In one the diamonds are replaced by vertical zigzags; they seem of about 600; Clara Rhodos iv, 274 fig. 301; Populonia, MA xxxiv 355, fig. 23, pl. 14.9; and one in Cambridge. In others the diamonds are replaced by stars (Al Mina, unpublished) or opposed triangles (Antissa, BSA xxxii, pl. 23.26). More exotic types may have black-figure (Megara Hyblaea ii pls. 67.3-4, 68; Istanbul 2190) or elaborate Wild Goat style decoration (Al Mina, JHS lx (1940) pl. 1 k-r). The unique bowl in London (Vroulia 165 f., fig. 52) can hardly be earlier than the last third of the century. There are Laconian imitations of bird bowls, BSA xxxiv (1933-4) 1 15. 9 With Middle Protocorinthian of c. 650 in an unpub- lished tomb at Caere. Some of the following may be of the third quarter of the seventh century from their context: Lerici, Apparecchiatura FoL 11 fig. 13 (Caere); MA xxv, 490 fig. 82 (Syracuse, with Protocorinthian); NSc 1925, 202 fig. 37 (Syracuse, Late Protocorinthian to Transitional); Clara Rhodos iii, 64 fig. 54.</page><page sequence="153">134 GREEK EMPORIO sixth-century (see p. 170). The last of the birds float with no ground line, but these are not found at Emporio. As with the bird-oenochoai (545-559) we are here dealing with a vase shape and a scheme of decoration foreign to Chios. But there is nothing in the fabric to tell certainly against local manufacture for most. Some if not all of these bowls will have been made in the island and, with the oenochoai, they represent Chios' part in the Subgeometric koine of East Greece which is best represented in Rhodes. It is an independent though contemporary tradition of Chios's own Subgeometric styles. We may contrast the patterns and grouping on the corresponding (early) Samian bowls.1 As has been shown, the Chian sequence at Emporio confirms that suggested by dated examples from other sites. We need not suppose that each centre producing these vases kept step with its neighbours, and it would seem that many of our examples are best matched elsewhere at dates somewhat earlier than those here assigned to the main periods at Emporio.

It seems the same as that found on Lesbos.3 Earliest come bowls of Period II with heavy lip mouldings (460, 461 ).4 All the rest are of Period IV. The bowls, which are smaller and have ribbed lips, are a common Aeolic type.5 The oenochoai6 and one-handled cups7 are of the usual East Greek type but less common shapes are the kotyle8 and the phialai mesomphaloi.9 470 might be from the broad lip of an amphora;10 and 475 from a kantharos, with the other fragments of cup-feet. This is the usual type of bucchero found in the northern cities of East Greece, and so reasonably called 'Aeolic'. It does not seem to have come farther south than Chios but it was carried to Naukratis, Aziris, Al Mina and the west. Phocaea may have been as important a centre for its production as Lesbos. Rhodian bucchero is quite different in appearance and shapes. Bowls 460. fig. 84. HS : H, Period II. Diam. o. 18. 461. fig. 84. HS:H, Period II. Diam. 0.22. Two suspension holes. 462.

AMPHORAE, HYDRIAE ETC. 48l~534 (plates 43-47) There are four fragments of vases with concentric semicircles on the shoulder. 481 and 482 are likely to be from large vases, probably amphorae ; 483 and 484 may be from smaller amphorae or oenochoai. The decoration is Protogeometric in spirit but not in date. The striped body of 482 is Geometric and none of the pieces needs be earlier than the eighth century, though they are likely to be among the earliest finds at Emporio. Their fabric is not exactly like that of the later Chian Geometric vases, and it may be that they are all imports. 485, from the Athena Temple, is a belly-handled amphora with double handles, a collapsing bird and chequer on one side, cross-hatched maeander on the other. This must be already of the seventh century. The striped decoration of thick bands alternating with groups of thin lines in thinned paint is characteristic of Chian closed vases in the seventh century.2 It recurs on a series of amphorae (487-498) of different shapes which have concentric circles on the shoulder often divided by wavy lines. These are mainly of Periods II and III. A somewhat different scheme of decoration is found on other fragments, some certainly, all perhaps, from hydriae. Scrolls, loops and tendril-moustaches are features of this group, as well as concentric circles. By Period IV the thick-and-thin striping is abandoned. The typical form now is well represented in complete examples excavated in Chios town by Professor N. Kontoleon, who has kindly allowed me to illustrate one here3 (plate 44T). The smooth lines of these vases are thoroughly Chian, and fragments of them are common finds on archaic sites in the island.4 The same type is current in the sixth century (see 821, 822). The earlier examples, as our 508, 509, lack the concentric circles, have more angular profiles and thickened lips. The wire birds on 516 show that the type begins quite early in the seventh century. The upright handle regu- larly carries a vertical stripe, as do the sixth-century wine-amphorae. The same decorative patterns are found on the related group of pithos-amphorae (521-523). Again Professor Kontoleon has allowed me to illustrate a complete vase from his excavations in Chios town5 (plate 44JQ. All are of the end of the seventh century, but at Emporio their an- cestry can be traced into Period III in 521 which has upright handles and an overhanging lip. Complete examples have been found at Berezan in South Russia,6 and at Pitane. 1 Cf. Courbin, BCH lxxvii (1953) 341 f; Shefton in Pera- chora ii, 386, 540.

A fragment from Aetos, Ithaca (BSA xlviii (1953) 308 fig. 15.1069 and p. 335) might be Chian but lacks the characteristic vertical stripe on the handle and is later than is suggested by Miss Benton.

The decora- tive schemes of all these vases has a Submycenaean air which has already been commented upon (seep. 105). Finally there are a number of belly-handled amphorae, particularly common in the Athena Temple, which might be considered the successors to vases like 485. They invariably carry a simple striped decoration. On fragments of two large examples, 524, 525 (cf. 526) this is of the thick-and-thin variety met on the earlier hydriae. These are from the Athena Temple and probably to be classed with the Period III vases from the Harbour Sanctuary. On these also appear groups of wavy lines in thinned paint. The others are more simply striped and all of the late seventh century (Period IV). Their one-piece profiles are similar to those of contemporary hydriae. TTT / y ■ **S ( 485 fig. 85 Scale 1:3.

This is current in Periods II and III, and was not perhaps made afterwards. The patterns are typically Chian: Ss and dots, metopes, hatched As. 537 is notable for its open decoration of butterfly and diamonds and for the use of white paint to outline the latter. The shape (cf. 588) is not one much met in East Greece.1 It may owe something to the Phoenician jugs with tall conical tops, in clay or bronze, which generally, however, have very narrow mouths. Among the other early pieces we may pick out 543 for its fine technique and unusual rosettes of concentric circles. The body of the vase is globular. The grouped lines in thinned paint between bands and the slip show that the piece is Chian but this particular style seems not to have been much practised. The sides of the vase may have been decorated with large concentric hoops, in a Cypriot manner, but the decoration which remains could as well be interpreted as part of big concentric circles in the same zone as the rosettes and Ss and dots. The most common type of oenochoe has a splaying neck set off at an angle from the squashed 1 One in bucchero is in Troy iv fig. 292 (36.722).</page><page sequence="161">142 GREEK EMPORIO globular body. The decoration consists of a variety of Chian motifs which are met on other vases. Hatched triangles and diamonds are particularly common. From among these vases one well-defined group can be picked out (545-559). The necks invariably have cross-hatched diamonds or triangles beneath a zigzag, and a trefoil lip. On the shoulder are panels with diamonds, triangles, key patterns, triangles with maeander hooks at the apices ('Rhodian trees'), and Subgeometric birds with triangles and diamonds as filling orna- ment; all these motifs are cross-hatched. One piece, 548, has also a quatrefoil and a chequer with lattices in the blanks. Below these panels and just above the widest part of the vase appears a strip of butterflies and bars. From their fabric the Chian origin of these bird-oenochoai cannot be doubted, but the range of motifs is only matched on Chios in another series, also of foreign5 inspiration - the bird-bowls. The bird-oenochoai are not uncommon in East Greece. One of the centres of manufacture was Rhodes,1 but they are known on Samos.2 Here, though, as on Chios, the assembly of the motifs is different and we have to do with Samian cousins of the Rhodian vases. The Chian oenochoai differ from their prototypes in various ways : notably the trefoil lip which is found on only one of these vases from Rhodes.3 Again the execution is less mechanical (though never very careful) and in one at least, 548, some native decoration has crept in. The floruit of the class is in our Periods II and III. The other Chian oenochoai of this shape are all influenced in varying degrees by the Rhodian vases. One complete example, from a Period IV level although the vase may be earlier,4 has the Rhodian round mouth, but the dotted chequer and strange birds over rocks or waves are native conceptions (582). For other figure decoration there is only 581, with a Chian bird, like one on a cup (356). The pieces with sparse multiple-brush patterns are reminiscent of styles current farther north in Aeolis.5 535*. HS : H, Period I. Black paint on cream slip. 536*. HS : H, Period I.

On the neck of one there are signs of vertical paring. They vary in size from 0.1 1 to 0.28 high. The shape is a common one in early Greek cooking wares. In Athens similar jugs were hand-made.1 There were not many fragments of plain vases in the votive deposits of the Harbour Sanctuary. The only notable piece is the fragment of an incised juglet, 605, which is like the incised Corin- thian or 'Argive' monochrome wares of the late eighth or early seventh century in all but fabric.2 597. fig. 94.

WILD GOAT STYLE VASES 6120-652 (plates 52-56) The choice of vases and fragments included in this section requires some explanation. The true Wild Goat style vases of the later seventh century - Rhodian, Chian and other - appear here together with their sixth-century Rhodian successors. Here too are the fragments with other elaborate floral or animal decoration which are of the later seventh or early sixth century, but not of any of the distinctive Chian groups which are listed in other sections. The Rhodian fragments are of well-known types which add nothing to our knowledge of the Rhodian style. There is, however, an observation to be made about the dating of the earliest Wild Goat style vases, be they Rhodian or Chian. They are found in the Harbour Sanctuary at Emporio first in Period IV. Their absence from Period III levels need not, of course, mean that they were not being made before the last third of the seventh century, but it does rather suggest that to start the style before the mid-century, as recent writers do, may be too early. The bull- vase, 634, with the fragments 635-651, form a distinctive group of early Wild Goat style vases which is probably Chian. The animal head on 634 is a bizarre and unusual concep- tion, but both a bull's head and a ram's head from Wild Goat vases have been found in south Russia.1 Otherwise the closest parallel is to be found in an Etruscan bucchero vase, now in Florence, and a strange Cypriot jug.2 Although figure vases in the form of animal heads are common in East Greece,3 animal-head spouts or necks of vases are not. The nearest we can get to this in seventh-century Greece is in the fine griffin-jug from Aegina, in London.4 The fragments of our vase fortunately allow a good idea of the bull's head, and also permit an accurate drawing of the profile and the disposition of the decoration on the rest of the vase (fig. 99) . The animals - goats, does, dogs, birds - are executed with uncommon care and finesse. No added colours are used. Of the other fragments, 635 is in a style similar to that of the bull-vase, but the hand is another's. The head, ears and paws of the dog on it are different, and a dot rosette is admitted to the fill. The dotted creature on 638 is probably a panther.5 The fabric of the dinos fragment, 651, suggests that it too is Chian. Although the shape is uncommon in Chios and the drawing not very like that of the Wild Goat style vases already discussed, neither shape nor drawing is particularly well matched in the work of any other East Greek centre. The mastiff-like lion is a peculiar version of the creatures with pointed noses, derived from the Assyrian type, which are so popular later on Chian vases. The floral on the nose represents the hairy wart seen here on several lions, oriental and Greek.6 Foxes are met occasionally on other East Greek vases, but this is one of the finest.7 The pose of the creature mounting the floral is repeated on the Chian chalices from Vulci.8 The floral was apparently akin to the type met often in the shoulder register of Wild Goat oenochoai: a volute and palm- ette motif partly outlined with a dotted band, of which we have a small piece only, before the 1 Arch.

We still lack enough evidence to enable us to distinguish clearly the specifically Chian fea- tures of any Wild Goat style vases. The bull-vase is our best single example from the island. Its filling ornament and drawing show that it is close to the better Rhodian vases. Clearly the Chian style was one of considerable finesse, and, to judge from the discreet filling ornament, not flamboyant, although the bull's head and ram's head vases were perhaps as unhappy conceptions, for all their originality, as some later Chian innovations in other arts. One or two peculiarities of the style may perhaps be picked out: the strange lion of 651 with his exaggeratedly pointed nose - a feature met again on the Chian chalices of the sixth century,3 the short wrinkles across the noses of dogs and does on 634, which lend them such strange expressions, and their narrow snouts, like goats'; the does' knobs, like griffins';4 the horse-shoe centre to the half-rosettes. The last is met too on some Rhodian vases but it is notable here because the horse-shoe roundel becomes almost the rule in Chios in the sixth-century while it remains rare on Rhodes, and is only regularly used otherwise by 'Melian' vase-painters. From about 600 the Chian Wild Goat style becomes far more clearly differentiated from that of other East Greek centres, and there is ample evidence for it on the chalices and bowls from Chios and other sites. The filling ornament, the drawing of the animals, especially the lion's heads, manes and legs, become entirely distinctive. It would be heartening if other examples of the earlier Chian Wild Goat style could be dis- tinguished on other sites, but of the style we know still too little and for the technique it must be remembered that a fine white slip cannot in itself be decisive. Professor R. M. Cook sug- gested that a fragment of a dish from Aegina might represent an early stage,5 but, for all its fine slip, the sharp rim profile is not Chian and the style tells nothing. A fine oenochoe from Old Smyrna6 is declared Chian by Rumpf. The slip is thick and white, the roundels are horse- shoes, the dogs have furrowed noses and the lions are as like those of the Vulci chalices and the Aphrodite bowl from Naukratis as any others. This might certainly be Chian. Professor Cook also suggested a Chian origin for a dinos from Gela, now in Palermo,7 which also seems most probable. The slip again is thick and white, and the roundels are horse-shoes, but the figure drawing and subsidiary ornament are unusual and poorly drawn. It should be possible eventually to distinguish more clearly the Wild Goat styles of the East Greek cities - of Chios, Samos, Ephesos, Miletos - and to assess their degree of dependence on Rhodes, or, as it may well prove, Rhodes's dependence on them in the early years of the new style.

CORINTHIAN VASES 653-686 (plates 56-57) The first stratified piece of Corinthian is from a level of Period III, 653. Unfortunately the silhouette animals on it are not of great use for dating purposes but they are unlikely to be later than Transitional and are most probably Late Protocorinthian. Other Transitional pieces may be 655 and 656 (Period IV levels). The other Period IV pieces are all typically Early Corinthian and none possibly later. There are very few pieces of the first half of the sixth century. Little Corinthian has been found in Chios1 and the fragments listed here form a very small proportion of the total amount of pottery found. It is, however, more common than Roebuck admits,2 and there would no doubt have been more of it had Chios not made her own decorated vases and had other East Greek suppliers of perfumed oil and flasks.

ATTIC VASES 687-723 (plates 57-58) There is as little Attic pottery in Chios in the sixth to fourth centuries as there was Corinthian in the seventh.1 The earliest, of about 570, is from Chios town. At Emporio the best pieces are from a wishbone-handled cup and a crater. Two fragments of Cassei cups and one from a Droop cup represent some of Athens's more popular export wares. There is a little more late black-figure. The red-figure is no more distinguished.2 Most of the black pottery in this section, some of it ribbed or with impressed decoration, is certainly Attic, but there were Ionian potteries also producing plausible imitations in the fourth century and some may be here. Other plain painted vases, certainly not Attic, are listed else- where (920-927). yy 7O7 ^^V= f^^ 7O9 fig. 104 Scale 1:3. Black-figure 687*. Cup fragment. HS:H, Period V.

OTHER SIXTH-CENTURY VASES About half the sixth-century pieces are from the Athena sanctuary on Prophètes Elias, immediately preceding and following the construction of the stone temple. The rest are from a late stage of the last terrace in the Harbour Sanctuary, pits and scattered deposits near the harbour, as well as scraps from nearby cemeteries. chalices 724-762 (plates 58-60) The development of the chalice shape from the Late Geometric skyphos has been traced on pp. 119-20 and illustrated by the finds from the deposits of Periods I to IV in the Harbour</page><page sequence="176">OTHER SIXTH-CENTURY VASES 157 Sanctuary. After Period IV, that is, after about 600 b.c., there is a significant change in the chalice shape. The foot becomes taller and conical. The lower bowl is more pinched and the transition to the straight walls is barely perceptible. These walls too are appreciably higher and the whole aspect is changed from the broad squat bowl of the seventh century to the new slim almost biconical form. The reason for the change is not clear. Some have seen in the foot the influence of the Lydian flasks (lydia), but conical feet are hardly new to Greece - even on small vases. í The broad deep bowl was perhaps thought unsuitable for a drinking vessel and the new bowl is more like that of an ordinary one-handled cup or kantharos. Indeed, from fragments it is not always easy to tell parts of a kantharos wall from a chalice. The slip now is at its whitest. Within there is still the paint over the slip, but also floral or other decoration in added white and red: at first elaborate, but by the middle of the century no more than two simple lotuses and two buds with hoops or a simple rosette at the centre. The big Rhodian skyphoi and 'Vroulia cups' show the same tendency for inner ornament in the first half of the century. The foot of the chalice is regularly painted black, sometimes with white hoops. Naukratis has yielded the fullest series and greatest variety of styles in the decoration of these vases, but there are grounds for believing that some of the styles found there are the pro- ducts of Chian potteries established in Naukratis, and do not necessarily represent homeland fashions.2 The fragments from Emporio, with others from the island and several exported vases (some of which might, of course, be from the Naukratis pottery) permit a rough classification of the main types of decoration on chalices in the first half of the sixth century. Emporio does not help much for details of chronology.3 I quote here comparable examples known to me on Chios or elsewhere - except at Naukratis, for the Chian vases there deserve separate treatment. Animal style chalices. These have the usual repertoire of Wild Goat style animals and filling orna- ment which we have found on the Early Wild Goat vases of Period IV and the broad chalices; fewer goats, perhaps, but more sphinxes, lions and bulls. Human figures are not excluded. The lower bowl has well-spaced stripes, the interior generally elaborate red and white patterns. Two classes can be distinguished. (i) heavy chalices: large vases with thick walls, as our 731-734. The handle zone usually has a double guilloche, like many of the seventh-century vases. These are closest to the finer Animal Style chalices from Naukratis. (ii) light chalices : the standard size, still often with elaborate patterns within. The handle zone has simpler patterns although still not usually the traditional 'metope'. As our 724-730. The Animal Style chalices probably belong to the first quarter of the sixth century.4 Simple Figure chalices.5 There is no filling ornament now and seldom even a rim pattern.

Most commonly the vases are decorated with the single figure of a sphinx or lion on either side (as 736-740) but human figures are found (as 735) and there may even be a small group of two figures. On the last the black-figure technique may appear beside the usual outline style.1 These are the latest of the figure-decorated slipped chalices, but none may be much later than 550 b.c. Plain chalices.2 Handle zone and interior usually as the last, but the walls are undecorated except, occasionally, for a simple rim pattern which may indicate a rather earlier date. Black-figure chalices. Interior and handle zone as on the Simple Figure chalices. Two principal subjects for decoration : (i) komasts. The earliest of the ko mast chalices, our 748, includes other figures which permit a comparison with the Chian Sphinx-and-Lion black-figure vases (see below). The filling rosettes are fairly carefully drawn and incised. Later they become mere discs or disappear, and the rim pattern goes. The drawing - now of komasts alone - although there are some women on Naukratis fragments - becomes weaker. These may have been made from about 580 to 550 or later.3 See our 749-760. (ii) animals. Rare ; usually a single creature.4 There are no examples at Emporio. There are also some minor varieties, apart from the main Naukratis groups : Unslipped black-figure chalices. One from Kameiros in Copenhagen;5 none found in Chios as yet. Contemporary with the black-figure kantharoi (our 838-841). All-black chalices. Our 761 . Patterned chalices. Our 762, with ivy leaves. Few of the Emporio pieces call for special comment. The elegant sphinxes of 724 must still be early in the century; a date which is also indicated by the variety and careful execution of the filling ornament. The woman on 735 is a rare example of a human figure on a chalice of this type. 748 is the earliest of the known Komast chalices. The slip is always a fine white, the paint a lustrous black or brown. The heavy slip has flaked away from many of the pieces, especially those from the Athena Temple. Many scraps of plain chalices were found, or of chalice feet and interiors with rosettes like 741.

There is no figure decoration. 1 Some kantharoi carry painted dedicatory inscriptions - at Naukratis, at Aegina, at Phanai in Chios, and here (see pp. 62 f., 244). These have the earlier type of decora- tion within, like the late chalices, with simple red and white lotuses and buds on the black paint, and are of the mid-century or before. The type with the reserved band within (those listed here) are of the second half of the century.

Others, listed here, are less easily matched by the harbour, and are likely to be of the first half of the sixth century. At least they are no later. Three distinctive types can be picked out: a low open cup with fine walls and thin lines within, rather as the seventh-century Type D ; a taller cup with straight splaying walls derived from the seventh-century Type B; and a small footed cup, probably derived from the simple late version of the seventh-century Type A.

The fine white dishes of the late seventh century are still made in the sixth, but there are also patterned pieces with florals or simple key patterns which are very close to Rhodian products of the same period. The sharp upturned rim so common on Rhodian dishes - usually stemmed - appears only once (805) . The most important single piece is the Athena plate (785), both for the identification of the figure (see p. 23) and the style of drawing. The debased horse-shoe roundels are purely Chian and the other filling ornament is still close to that seen on seventh-century vases. Of the figure we have nothing above the knees and so are denied the opportunity of close comparison with other Chian drawing.

BSA xxxv (1934-5) pl. $6(1, from Olympi in south Chios. black-figure: sphinx-and-lion style 824-837 (plates 62-63) This is the principal Chian black-figure style of the earlier sixth century. The technique appears on chalices only later (see p. 158).1 There are some points of contact between the komast chalices and the Sphinx-and-Lion vases (which are never chalices) but the division of shape and subject - chalices or bowls, men or animals- applies generally. Friezes of sphinxes facing left or of lions facing right account for most of the decoration. Other animals and human beings are sometimes admitted. The commonest shape is the bowl with a domed lid, the interior being occasionally decorated with animal friezes also,2 instead of simply slipped. A few other shapes are met, notably some exotic ones which carry moulded heads (see p. 1 94) . 3 A fragment from the siege-mound at Old Smyrna4 suggests that the style begins as early as about 600 b.c., or rather, before the end of the Early Corinthian period, wherever that is to be dated. Some pieces at Naukratis related to the more developed vases in the style are decorated with subjects and motifs which imitate Laconian black-figure of about 570 b.c.5 The style was no doubt still current for a while in the second quarter of the sixth century but certainly did not survive as late as most of the komast-chalices.6 At Emporio there are pieces of several bowls - one an exceptionally large specimen (824), and another with a spout (833) . The last is also decorated with white and red figures over the black, a technique which we shall meet again in Chios (see p. 1 69 f.) . Other shapes are a plate or dish (835) and, it seems, a 'kothon' (837) which is unexpected in East Greece. This is decorated with eyes, which, in the east, we find also on Rhodian bowls of the mid-century. 824*. Lid and bowl fragments, figs. 114, 115.

The incisions are bold and clear, and the animal-style - or the little of it that can be judged - does not owe a great deal to the animals of the slipped black-figure chalices or the Sphinx-and-Lion vases. A human figure appears on a fragment of one of these kantharoi found at Naukratis, * and the same style of figure-drawing appears on the fragment of a lid from 'Larisa3,2 as well as the unslipped chalice in Copenhagen (see p. 158). The figure-style is related to the latest of the black-figure komast-chalices. These kantharoi are a most distinctive ware, probably quite short-lived, of the third quarter of the sixth century. fig. 116 Scale 1:3. 838*. fig. 116. Athena Temple Cella, Period II. H. 0.09. Cocks.

Of the slipped vases 843 is from a two-handled pot of a distinctive Chian shape. Complete examples of the same form but without figure decoration are 844, and a vase in Chios Museum. There is one from Olbia1 with black-figure animals in the style of the late chalices. Another, with a pattern of tongues like ours, was found at Naukratis (BM 1 924.1 2-1. 180). The swan on 843 is in the same style, of the mid-century. A larger, plain vase of similar shape has been found in Athens, but is not Attic.2 The palm-tree vase (842) has an exceptionally fine white slip and good paint. Something like the shape, and with it the white-ground technique, is met in Athens, but ours is simply a bellying elegant version of the long-popular East Greek one-handled jug (see 592-596). The ivy leaves take us to the chalice, 762. The man between the palms might be Apollo, who had a grove of the trees at nearby Phanai (Strabo xiv 645). The knob-ended rosette beneath the handle is like some Attic stylizations. Our vase should be of the very end of the sixth century, at least. The same technique and style is seen on a fragment of a mug from Old Smyrna, and a still later example of fine Chian drawing on a white slip, but this time in outline only, is seen on a fragment from Chios town.3 846 is from an unusual basket-handled vase with a spout. There is no incision but black, red and white are used lavishly. The rows of dots are reminiscent of Clazomenian but the fabric could well be Chian. There are rosettes like these on the unslipped chalice in Copenhagen (see p. 158) and compare the blobs on 852. A similar colour scheme appears on a fine rhyton from Old Smyrna,4 and the rows of coloured dots are seen on other plainer East Greek vases.5 There is a further connection between 846 and the Smyrna rhyton. The latter is the earliest surviving Greek imitation of a popular eastern type of vessel.6 846 has a distinctive type of spout, set upright and close to the rim, for which the best parallels are to be found on Achae- menid Persian vases,7 while for the combination of spout and basket-handle we can turn to rather earlier clay vessels from Persia.8 These two vases, from Smyrna and Chios, may be from a workshop in Persian Ionia (even, possibly, Chios) which was well familiar with the pottery of its masters. An askos with a ram's head in Istanbul, painted red with white dots ( ? from Rhodes) may also be related. On all the other fragments listed in this section the decoration is painted in white with red on a painted background. Where there are figures there is incision - like Six's technique in Attic. But on Chian vases this technique has a longer history. We have seen it on the lip of a Sphinx-and-Lion vase (833) and, again, without incision, it appears both within and outside some Naukratis chalices.9 On the extraordinary askos-lid (847) white only is used for simple orientalizing patterns, still of the first half of the century. The incised figures, the graceful kid and the red-eyed fish (848, 849) need not be much later than the middle of the century.

The void rays continue from the seventh century, as well as the use of colour and occasional rouletting inside. Like the bird-bowls they were probably made outside Rhodes also, and the only piece here which I am sure is a Rhodian import is the polychrome foot, 859, For complete examples of this type see Vroulia pls. 25.12 (with void rays), 43.25, 20 (without rays) .

THE LATER VASES Nearly all are from Periods II and III of the Athena Temple together with some Hellenistic pieces from the area of the Harbour Sanctuary. chalices 878-887 (plate 65) These are all from Period II of the Athena Temple. They are degenerate followers of the fine sixth-century chalices. The only decoration is now stripes; the only added colour perhaps two white lines on the foot. The interior too is striped over the slip, if it is decorated at all. The handles lose their round section and become lumpy straps, set higher and higher on the straight splaying walls of the cup, where all distinction between wall and bowl has vanished. On 880, which may be one of the latest, they even droop. A groove which appears on several examples may have been a guide for setting the handles. The slip is still fine and white, and the walls thin but the potting is otherwise very careless. The latest examples known to me, perhaps as late as the third century, are from Well H at Kofina, by Chios town.2 On these the fabric is coarse, the feet squat and lumpy with turned-up toes (cf. our 882). A miserable end to the history of a Chian shape which can be traced for nearly half a millennium. 1 BSA xlix (1954) 140, 'fragment of a closed vase with painted scale pattern'.

STONE SCULPTURE AND BASES 1-24 (plates 68-72) The three limestone figures from late seventh-century deposits (1-3) are closely matched by finds on Rhodes at Lindos. Publishing these Blinkenberg indicated close parallels in Cyprus and thought that all were Cypriot, imported as votives.1 They must have accompanied the considerable trade in terracottas from Cyprus which in the seventh century flooded East Greek sites. As Blinkenberg observed, the lions found on Rhodian sites, and now at Emporio,2 are rare in Cyprus, and the suspicion might arise that, as with the terracottas, so with the stone figurines, imitative workshops existed to produce specialities for the local markets. If so, the Chian lions probably came from Rhodes.3 Gjerstad agrees with the view that there were local workshops, but believes they were manned by Cypriots.4 The limestone forearm (4) is from a much larger work, certainly not Cypriot. Stratigraphi- cally it belongs still to the seventh century but even if it is the earliest known example of Chian stone sculpture it is singularly uninformative. With 5-7 we have the opportunity to study, albeit only with fragments, some native examples of Chian archaic sculpture. The Chian school is still better known from literary sources than from statues certainly attributed to the famous Chian artists, and in discussions of Chian art little note is generally taken of what has been found in the island itself or of the few clay proto- mae which could be relevant (see pp. 195 f.). Any further scrap of evidence for archaic sculpture in the island itself is of extreme importance, and even the fragments presented here add appreciably to what can be said about the Chian style.5 The two kore statuettes, or all that remains of them, were found in the Cella of the Athena Temple, buried in the fill behind Altar A when it was enlarged in the fourth century. They belong, however, to the earliest years of the temple building, and no doubt stood within it as votive attendants of the goddess. Both are about one-third life size. 5 is in white sandstone, like that quarried at Emporio on Prophètes Elias. The head owes nothing to Cyprus, and is purely in the East Greek tradition, where too the carving of the eye, with its flat planes, can be readily matched.6 The flat fold at the centre front is a feature com- mon enough on archaic korai, but its answering fold at the back of the figure is less familiar.7 Too little of the head is preserved to admit speculation on its style. The large eye and compact proportions suggest a date in the third quarter of the sixth century. Her white marble companion, 6, is probably later and holds her skirt in a different way.

Only at the side are the tight pleats shown, and only the most delicate modelling indicates the stretch of the material over the legs. Even the underside of the fold is presented as a flat, rising surface, and not treated with the complex folds of Athens korai. The hem of the dress flows around the feet, as it does on earlier Ionian figures.1 The simple treatment of the drapery may have been deliberately conceived to set off the more ornate surface decora- tion of the upper part of the figure, which we shall see reason to believe a characteristic of the Chian style. The fragment of a kore from Metochi, 7, is of far more importance. All that is preserved is the centre part of the figure, carved in medium-grain white marble, about two-thirds life size. We have the part from above the waist to the thighs. The figure is wearing a chiton without himation. The stuff is pulled out over a belt and the overfall hangs with a wavy lower edge. Below it the folds of the skirt, which are deep and slight- ly undercut, run straight down, and it is likely that in the centre, broken away, there was a broad flat fold. The fragment is almost columnar, with no hint of modelling or curve at the 3 fig. 127 Scale 1:2. hips. On either side the stuff curved round with the body, and then back and away from it. The right arm was perhaps held close to the side leaving room for only a slight dip in the material between it and the body. The left arm must have been held away from the body to judge from the width of the material remaining there. The slight flat folds which appear on the poorly preserved rear of the fragment show that the skirt was being pulled away to the left, but from the front it is clear that it could not have been held high, as it is on many later korai, and the hand could not have been far from the upper thigh, and to its side rather than slightly before it. In this respect the stance is unusual. The tightening of the skirt accounts for the rather exaggerated way in which the body narrows down over the hips.2 If the upper part of the chiton had been treated naturalistically we would expect some indi- cation of the folds or edge of the sleeve beside the body. Instead, the material is conceived as a single piece running across the body and arms, and it is accordingly decorated with no distinc- tion of the loose sleeve. The decoration is carefully executed in low relief and comprises well- spaced groups of five or six parallel wavy lines set close together. Between each group are isolated lengths of single wavy lines grouped to splay out from top to bottom so that at any one point there are three such lines side by side. The complicated rhythm can barely be appre- ciated in the present condition of the surface of the stone; the pattern is sketched in fig. 128. 1 E.g., the Samian figures, E. Buschor, Altsamische Standbilder figs. 85 ff. For the general treatment of the drapery cf. the fine terracotta from Gela, MA xvii ( 1 906) pl. 5 1 . 2 This explanation of the fragment as the centre part of a small kore may not seem entirely satisfactory. The only alternative is that we have the lower legs of an over-life-size figure and that the patterned stuff is the lower part of a cloak hanging at the back above the ankles. Against this are the minutely elaborate surface detail which can hardly be admitted all over the back of a colossal figure, and the spread of the material to both sides, not just to the side at which the skirt is held.</page><page sequence="202">STONE SCULPTURE AND BASES 183 There are a few korai of the last third of the sixth century from the Athenian Akropolis who wear only chitons in this manner. * On them the formal vertical pattern on the upper part of the chiton gives a restful effect, rather as in the peplos figures, in contrast to the other korai who wear elaborately arranged himatia with a diagonal element. Another feature of the chiton korai is the broad flat fold which runs down the front of the skirt and which we may reasonably restore to the Chian fragment. Although some hold their skirts taut it is in such a manner that the vertical centre fold, answering the pattern above the waist, is not disturbed. It has generally been assumed that such korai reflect closely Ionian models, although hitherto no example of just this type has been found in East Greece. The Athenian figures may help towards an appreciation of the complete Metochi kore. One in particular, Akr. 683, 2 gives a good illustration of the way in which the material of the chiton runs across the body and arms with no concessions to the sleeve folds, although in this instance the pattern of the material does change direction. She is also holding her skirt taut without disturbing its flat centre fold. Though the carving of our fragment is quite different fig. 128 Pattern of drapery. she must still be a close contemporary of Akr. 683 and the other chiton korai mentioned above. With so little preserved no more precision in date is permissible than the last third of the sixth century, perhaps early in it. In the patterning of the chiton our kore far outdoes her Attic and Ionian cousins. Generally the tiny folds which splay out from the buttons or stitching at the top of the chiton meet to form an overall pattern. On the Chian fragment they have been kept separate to make distinct strips or panels, themselves carrying their own pattern of short wavy lines (fig. 128). The closest parallels to this sort of decoration are afforded by the two early korai fragments found near Chios town.3 These may be more than a generation earlier but the same principle of decoration is clear; clearer, when they are contrasted with their Samian kin.4 This could prove an im- portant feature in the task of identifying Chian work. Such is not my purpose here but it may be remarked that similar patterning is found at the tops of the himatia of two figures from the Akropolis in Athens, which have, on quite other grounds, been thought Chian.5 The problem of white marble in Chios has been mentioned already.6 The quality ofthat used in 6 and 7 is as that of the architectural mouldings from Phanai and Emporio, and of the early torsos from Chios town. All the other fragments of sculpture were recovered from the debris of the Early Christian 1 Akr. 602, 670, 683. See Lippold, op. cit., 77 f.; Payne, op. cit., 36.

They are for the most part miserable scraps, but by good fortune five of them, 8-12, seem likely to be from a single statue, an important work of the fifth century b.c. From the fragments of face and hair, 8-10, we may deduce a youthful figure, rather more than life size. The rendering of the hair is closely matched on statuary dated in the second quarter of the fifth century. Very close in hair style are the Apollos of the type of the so-called Omphalos Apollo and the Choiseul Apollo.1 Our fragments may very well be from a figure such as these, and the square hole at the temple on 8 probably fixed the lumpy forelocks which are seen on them, although in the Roman copies (of an original bronze) they are made in one piece with the head. The quality of our fragments makes sure that they are from an original Greek work of about 460 b.c. The hair is tied with a fillet into which the back hair is tucked, as it is beneath the plaits of the Apollos. The fillet ends hang over the shoulders. The right arm was held a little forward, and the hand may have held an offering or an attribute. A votive statue of this type is seen on a vase by the Niobid Painter.2 Ours too may have been a votive, but its date corre- sponds so closely with the presumed date for the construction of the apsidal temple in the Har- bour Sanctuary that it is tempting to see it as something more: the cult statue. There is no certain indication of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated, but Apollo was worshipped here in the sixth century and his may well have been the principal shrine by this date. The stele fragment in Chios Museum, 21, was found in the sea at Emporio. A mourning youth sits on rocks with the forepart of a ship in the background: a composition seen on other island stelai.3 A very similar mourning figure, seated on rocks, appears on a relief on Samos, but without the ship,4 and an Attic relief has part of a ship beside the conventional funerary departure scene.5 Whole ships appear more frequently on stelai,6 or the prows of warships in a separate field.7 Our fragment seems to be good late Hellenistic work. Three statue bases were found in the Harbour Sanctuary. That in the Athena Temple has been discussed with the architecture ofthat building (pp. 13, 26). 22 is dated by its inscrip- tion to the later sixth century b.c. The shallow, nearly square cutting in its top is unusual. Kleobis and Biton apparently stood on rectangular plinths, but these are most uncommon.8 Again, it may have been intended for a seated figure (as in the Geneleos group), a Kybele naiskos, or some other sort of votive monument entirely. The dedication is by a freed slave who offers a 5eK&lt;5rniv, a tithe, no doubt of the price of his freedom.9 The second inscribed base, 23, is of c. 450 b.c. Complete, there were probably no more than the four irregular sinkings in its surface. It is unthinkable that these should be for separate supports for a single figure, and we must assume four separate figures. They might be half-life size human figures - a family group; but the composition is still strange. In the 'Geneleos group' on Samos, over a century before, the figures stood side by side. 24 was for a standing figure, nearly life size, probably archaic. Studniczka sketched a 'death-feast' votive relief which he saw in the Panagia church at Pyrgi.10 From Komi, just north-east of Emporio, is part of an inscribed grave relief from which all the figure decoration is missing. 1 1 1 Cf.

(HS PERIODS i-iv) 25-102 (plates 73-79) The early figurines come exclusively from the votive deposits of the Athena Temple and the Harbour Sanctuary, and comprise human and animal figures together with a number of</page><page sequence="206">CLAY FIGURINES 187 imports, largely Cypriot. The material is very similar to, although of course not as rich as, that from the Heraion on Samos and reference will often be made below to Ohly's publication of the Samian pieces.1 The main types at Emporio find ready parallels on Samos except for some early figures and a few groups which must be considered peculiarly Chian rather than sharing in the common characteristics of North Ionian art in this period. Three different fabrics may be broadly distinguished in the figures. The first is of a finely levigated pink clay which closely matches that used for decorated pottery of the same period. The second is red, usually fired very hard and with a grey core; this again is met in the larger Chian vases, such as the wine-amphorae. The third is of a coarse red or grey clay with many white inclusions, and is clearly the same as that employed for the coarse one-handled pots found in the houses of the archaic town and in some of the deposits. No one fabric or preparation is confined to a particular class of figurine. Thus, the coarsest appears for the finely moulded head, 63, .and the finest for many of the cruder solid figurines.2 All fabrics are known in cer- tainly Chian vase wares and there can be no reasonable doubt that the figurines were made in the island. Many are decorated with a paint which fires in various shades from black to red, and added colour is rarely found. Some of the earlier pieces carry a pale cream slip, not very thick, like that on Geometric Chian vases. Later the heavy pale cream or white slip so characteristic of the archaic wares also appears. In technique the figures can be broadly classed into the solid and the hollow. The former are generally crudely fashioned and relatively small; the latter have their main parts made on the potter's wheel, although solid limbs and heads may be added. Moulds are used for the faces of two figures, one, and probably both of which had wheel-made bodies (63,64). Unfortunately the stratigraphy of the figures from the deposits of the Harbour Sanctuary throws little light on their chronology since most were found in levels of Period IV. They were certainly not all of the years immediately preceding the end ofthat Period as their considerable variety and the dates suggested on stylistic grounds prove. It seems likely that some part of the sanctuary which had harboured terracotta dedications for some generations had been cleared out at this time. Some pieces from earlier levels are of some help. From Period I comes 25 for which a very early date would be necessary on grounds of style. Of Period II is one of the crude animal heads from a hollow figure, 33, and a hollow leg from another beast, 37. In Period III were parts of crude, solid creatures, 32, 35, and of a human figure, 60. The dating suggested by these pieces corresponds with that given for comparable Samian figurines. Ohly published two useful and relevant groups accompanied by pottery. The first, under Heka- tompedon II, can hardly be later than the first quarter of the seventh century; the second, under the South Stoa, hardly later than the third quarter.3 And now there are figurines from Well F (down to about 670), Well G (down to about 640-630) and the Bothros (down to about 600). 4 1 In two articles, AM lxv (1940) 57-102 with pls. 35-62, and AM lxvi (1941) 1-46 with pls. 1-35. These I refer to here as Ohly, i and Only, ii. Important supplements by Vierneisel in AM lxxvi (1961) 25 ff., the groups published in AM Ixxiv (1959) 10 ff., and Diehl in AA 1964, 494 ff. 2 Cf. Ohly, i 70 f. 3 Ohly, i 82-90, Groups H and J. The dating of the earlier groups is more difficult since little of the accompanying pottery is identified in the publication. Ohly mentions relevant pieces. The vase from Group E can hardly be earlier than the middle of the eighth century and is probably nearer its end. Pottery from the fill of Altar V (Group G) probably comes into the seventh century. The sherd from Group G is undatable. For Group A, under Altar II, Buschor postulated a mid-ninth century date, but as there is no published Iron Age pottery from the Heraion which de- mands a date earlier than the eighth century there are no good grounds for dating any of the figurines so early. For the Mycenaean or Submycenaean in the sanctuary area see AM lxxii ( 10,^7) 36-38. 4 Walter and Vierneisel, A M Ixxiv (1959) 10 ff.</page><page sequence="207">l88 GREEK EMPORIO The identification of the subjects of some of the figurines is discussed elsewhere, but the general distribution of types and classes may be remarked here. Of the 64 pieces from the Harbour Sanctuary as many as 16, one quarter of the whole, are imports; and of these 14 are Cypriot. Of the other figurines rather more than half are human, the rest animal. No imported pieces were identified among the few early figurines from the Athena Temple, which were near- ly all human. The record of imports reflects closely the difference between the two sanctuaries, one by the harbour patronized by travellers and visitors, one above the remote town visited only by the local population. The difference in the proportion between animal and human figures from the two sources is probably not significant. Some pieces from the later levels in the Harbour Sanctuary are included here on grounds of style. In view of their poor state of preservation several of the fragments from the Athena Temple are represented here in drawings. The Animals. The earliest piece, 25, is also from the lowest level of the deposits in the Harbour Sanctuary. It is the rump of a wheel-made animal, most probably a horse, and represents a type of animal figurine, with blunt chest and rump, which is met in Mycenaean and Sub- mycenaean Greece. On similar creatures, no doubt of Submycenaean date, from the Amyklaion in Lakonia we find the same arrangement of two ventilation holes, one on each side of the creature's tail.1 The date of our fragment, and of analogous finds on Samos, presents some difficulty.2 None of these creatures carries ordinary Geometric decoration and most, including our fragment, observe Mycenaean motifs and treatment. An isolated, and rather sophisticated Protogeometric example in Athens is decorated in the manner appropriate to its date.3 Ours may safely be called Submycenaean in style although this does not necessitate a date particularly close to the end of the Late Bronze Age, and, with other pieces mentioned below, it could repre- sent a pre-Migration period of Emporio's history. Comparison and contrast with the horse, 26, are significant. This is again a wheel-made beast, but fashioned in the Greek Geometric manner with a slim, thick-walled body. The high-tilted head and 'trumpet' muzzle are hardly Geometric, however, and are closer to My- cenaean forms. The decoration, moreover, is quite Mycenaean or Submycenaean with the irregular wavy lines on the flanks and triangle pattern on the chest; this is a pattern which survived into the Protogeometric period in Mainland Greece and recurs on some archaic vases but is quite foreign to Chian Geometric vase-painting. It appears on one of the Submycenaean wheel-made horses from the Amyklaion which have been mentioned in connection with 25/ Despite these Submycenaean features another factor determines the date of the piece in the eighth century b.c., and this is the fact that the horse is standing on a flat circular lid, part of the edge and flange of which is preserved beside its rear left leg. The motif is unknown in My- cenaean or Protogeometric Greece but becomes familiar in the eighth century when, on Attic Geometric vases, one horse, and later two, three or four, are found standing on pyxis lids. The position of our horse and the apparent size of the lid show that he was one of a team of at least two, and so is hardly likely to antedate the appearance of such lids on Attic vases of the first half of the eighth century. But the differences from the Attic models are striking: the wheel-made body, the decoration, the shape of the lid with an overlap and not a slip-in flange. It is as though the artist, still steeped in the tradition of Submycenaean figures as that represented by 25, is aping the new Attic fashion, which could only have become familiar to him at the time when, or just after, other mainland Greek Geometric fashions reached the Eastern Greeks.

On 27, from a Period II level, a fragment of a similar horse, the ridge of the mane is not treated in this manner. 28 might be from another animal of this type. 29 (fig. 130), found near 26, though certainly not from the same object, is part of a vase or lid prepared for the attachment of some plastic decoration ; it is included here for its possible relevance to the horses from lids. 30 is perhaps the earliest figurine from the Athena Sanctuary and seems to be from an unusually large wheel-made animal-vase. It appears to have been carrying a wheel-made con- tainer on its back, near the rump, and this may have been the orifice of the vase, a device which is not uncommon on early animal- vases.1 The other hollow animal figurines are of cattle, probably bulls, and are very like those found on Samos (Ohly, i 90 ff. pls. 46-56). One head, 32, is rather porcine and solid, unlike the others. They have none of the subtlety of modelling or careful decoration found on the horses, though there is some detail and decoration in the rendering of the legs and feet. The limbs here, 35-38, are solid except for 37 which has a hollow haunch and must have been attached awkwardly to a cylindrical body in the manner more typical of the earlier, Submycenaean creatures. Many of the Samian animals of this type are from contexts of the eighth and earliest seventh centuries, and although only two of our fragments are from levels of Period II (33, 37) and two of Period III (32, 35), dates not later than the first quarter of the seventh century are probably to be preferred for them. None need be earlier than the mid-eighth century. The solid animal figurines on Samos are smaller and later than the hollow creatures and most are assigned by Ohly to the seventh century (Ohly, i 98-101 pls. 57-61). The same is true for the size of the examples from Emporio, and none in fact was found in any context earlier than Period IV. Most are again cattle, 43 certainly a bull, while on Samos most are horses ; we have, perhaps, one cavalier, 72. Decoration and modelling are again summary and the coroplast is now devoting more attention and skill to figures of human beings. 45 and 46 are flat and in low relief, their backs being unpainted and unmodelled though not completely flat. Their purpose is obscure as they show no signs of ever having been applied to the wall of a vase as relief decoration. 47, the only example from the Athena Temple, is not readily understood. The bow-legged stance and modelling is very like that of a bull from Samos (Ohly, i pl. 61.446) but ours lacks the dewlap, and has no horns, but large ears. It looks more like a bear; it might be a dog. Human Figures. The raised arm from the figure of a votary, 48, can be discussed in much the same terms as were the earliest of the wheel-made animal figurines. Indeed it seems likely that the fragment is from the same disturbed deposit in the Harbour Sanctuary as the horse, 26. The arm and body were made separately, both on the wheel. The type is an elaborate version of the earliest of the Samian votaries, women with raised hands,2 which may in some way be derived from the Mycenaean Y figurines. The decoration, however, is again Submycenaean in charac- ter,3 the scale pattern being quite foreign to any Geometric Greek, let alone Chian, vase painter. The explanation and date of the piece are no doubt the same as for the horse, 26, near which it was found. 1 Cf. some Cypriot examples in SCE iv.2 fig.

For the gesture and the decoration on a female figure see Schneider-Lengyel Griechische Terrakotten fig. 2 (Munich; from Rhodes) . Mr. R. V. Nicholls has suggested that the arm may have been bent, but the angle at which it rises from the body seems to me rather too steep.</page><page sequence="209">190 GREEK EMPORIO The other figurines of men and women present a very considerable variety and include many examples which can be closely paralleled on Samos, Rhodes and elsewhere in the East Greek world, as well as groups which seem purely local in inspiration. Two questions about them must go only partly answered here. First, their identity, human or divine. As long as there is some doubt about the major deity to whom they were offered, or about which of several deities was being honoured, this question must remain open. Rarely, however, can such figurines be asso- ciated with a particular deity or cult statue, and, unless they exhibit some peculiarities which suggest the divinity, they are best regarded as representations of the votaries themselves, or as surrogates for temple attendants. The second question is of sex. Ohly distinguished the female pellet-like breasts from the modelled chests of a few other certainly male figures (Ohly, ii 6 f.). But examples from other sites show that a man's nipples may also be represented by small pellets of clay if no clothes are worn,1 so only the more fully contoured breasts can unquestion- ably be accepted as feminine, as well as clothed figures with breasts indicated; for many the doubt must linger. Hair style is not decisive, nor need pointed chins imply beards unless they are appropriately painted. Men may wear earrings as well as women. Long skirts at least should be feminine, except for charioteers. Three types of head occur among the earlier fragments, and each is closely matched by Samian groups distinguished by Ohly, and can readily be paralleled on other East Greek sites. The first (a) has the head thrown back with the forehead and nose horizontal, the back of the head vertical. 49 is a small but clearly recognizable version of the type. An example in Samos is from a context not later than the first quarter of the seventh century, but the style must have its roots in the eighth century.2 (b) is represented by bird-like heads with domed skulls and exaggerated brows and noses. There are two examples from the Athena Temple, 50, 51. 3 In (c) 52 and 53, the heads are again angular and more lifelike with well-painted features, flat- topped heads and short hair. With these we are in the first half of the seventh century.4 These heads would certainly have owned wheel-made bodies, and one of them, 51, is in fact hollow. 54 shows the sort of features which could be lightly modelled onto a wheel-made head, with the basic cylindrical form conceding nothing to any conscious style. Equally indeterminate, 55 is a primitive of uncertain date.5 56 and 57 are the type of wheel-made body which might be associated with some of the heads already discussed.6 The first is a typical piece with two ventilation holes at the back. The unusual form of the second with a flat ridge above the chest is explained by the fact that the body was made on a wheel as a cylinder closed at the top by a flat disc (the base on the wheel) to the rear part of which the head was fixed. The fragment 58 preserves the hand of a hollow figure; it was presumably raised and resting on or below the breasts. The circular section of the solid upper torso 60 shows that it was probably to have a wheel-made skirt. Of only one of these primitive figures is the head preserved together with part of the body, 61. Here the head is solid, the upper body hollow. An added ring of clay lay as a wreath or head- dress on the crown, and the ears are represented by large flaps.7 The odd expression and puffed cheeks set this piece rather apart from the others discussed. It is perhaps a little earlier than the middle of the seventh century. 1 E.g., Rhodes, cf. Higgins, i pl. 2.7; Cretan Coll. in Oxford^, pl. 30.382. 2 Ohly, ii 12-5 on the type.

The pointed chin is painted to represent a beard, and, as is the practice of many Ionian gentlemen, earrings are worn.2 This again will be of the first half of the seventh century. By the middle of the century the Ionian centres, at least Samos and Chios, had learned the use of the mould for clay figurines. At first it is employed only for heads; later for bodies and the backs of figures. The innovation is no doubt due to the inspiration of the Cypriot figurines which were at that time beginning to become common on East Greek sites. The mould was adop- ted earlier in Mainland Greece and perhaps Crete, and the inspiration was more directly from Syrian and other Near Eastern centres, not Cyprus.3 An early example is the head, 63, which bears the features and hair style which are to be the hallmarks of East Greek figures of this type for the rest of the century.4 The unusual pointed head in the profile view is noteworthy. As on most of these early moulded heads the eyes are outlined by a fine ridge or lids like Cypriot heads of the same date.5 63 may be slightly earlier than the middle of the seventh century. The second moulded head, 64, must be later by about a generation. The features are well-defined and picked out by careful painting. The artist had not given the head its full depth but the features have been impressed as it were on a plaque.6 The body, however, has all the fulness which the wheel can give it, and the breasts are generously modelled. Painting indicates the edge of the short-sleeved chiton, a necklace of pomegranate pendants, and the belt which nips the waist above the full skirt. The arms are raised in a gesture of adoration. Some fragments of solid figurines represent humbler styles. The board-like 65 with barely modelled breasts and feet could closely follow the model of some wooden cult statue possibly at Emporio, and may be of the eighth century. The crude feet, 66, rather suggest an abortive attempt to imitate Cypriot forms.7 67 is painted in a fashion akin to that of some Samian figurines (e.g. Ohly, ii pl. 8). Unfortunately the lines and stippling are not carefully enough applied to permit certain identification of the Ionian mantle worn crosswise which is seen on some Samian figures of the mid-seventh century.8 68, however, gives more information about dress. The overfall of the chiton was so deep that it has been broken away.9 Presumably a belt was worn and, though the sides of the dress are not caught in, its position is indicated by a black band at either side. The dots along the sides of the figure can only represent the stitching of the chiton. The quality of the slip suggests a date rather late in the seventh century. Some fragments of flat, barely modelled figures may be male (69-71). 72 is almost surely a horse-rider. 10 73 and 74 are most probably female, with the mons veneris prominently modelled ; 74 wears a belt and the pubic hair is shown by a painted T. The erect phallus, 75, may not be from a complete figure, but part of a figure vase. * x It is not, however, pierced to serve as a spout. 1 But compare the heads on a multiple lamp from Gela, MA xlvi 35 ff. figs. 14-16, pls. 8, 9 (AA 1964, 729, fig. 46). 2 Beazley (Attic Vase Paintings in Boston ii 56) denies ear- rings to all Greek men, but we must except the early Ionians. Admittedly, as he points out, Anakreon despises such effeminacy; but Anakreon, an Ionian, had more oppor- tunity to observe and disapprove of the practice. The dress of the revellers on vases, discussed ibid., seems to be as much that of an Ionian komast as of a woman; cf. now Revue des Arts viii (1958) 202-8.

The first comprises parts of the skirt and feet of large hollow figurines whose only decoration is coarsely incised criss-cross or oblique lines (76-78). They are very crude and their toes are dis- tinguished in a childishly direct manner. They probably belong to the middle years of the century; one fragment may be from a level of Period III. The second is of small and well-made hollow figures. They are distinguished by the use of a good cream slip comparable with the best used by the Chian potter in the second half of the seventh century. In 79 and 80 the upper torso is preserved. Both wear belts, and on the second the stitches fastening the backing ( ? leather) to the bronze hoop are represented by white dots. For some original bronze belts of this type from the sanctuary see below. A rather more complete example was found at Phanai,1 but there is little on Samos resembling these figures and only some Cypriot figurines at all approach the type.2 On the fragment 81 the belt is shown in relief, and the skirt is treated as in the first group mentioned here. The foot and skirt fragment, 82, might be from a figure like these, though rather larger. The way the foot is made separately and fastened to the skirt, which is cut back to let the toes protrude, imitates Cypriot practice. Feet are generally not provided for the East Greek wheel-made figurines which stand simply on the bases of their cylindrical skirts. The foot, 83, was from a much larger figure and, from its decoration, it clearly was without a skirt to cover it and so must be from a male figure, or possibly from the separate legs of a doll constructed rather in the manner of the early Boeotian bell-shaped dolls. A boot is worn, presumably of leather, laced from near the toes to high at the ankle; perhaps a hunter's boot.3 The last group is perhaps the most interesting of all. It is of male figures freely modelled in solid clay, though three fragments represent the type in hollow figures; no head is preserved. They are tall and thin, the legs in particular being spindly with the knee-caps more prominent than the muscles. In three out of four examples the legs are held close together; in one, 85, they are slightly parted. From the best preserved piece, 84, we can see that the chest and but- tocks were boldly modelled, but that otherwise the figure has little more pretension to anatomi- cal accuracy beyond the successful portrayal of an athletic and powerful body. The chest and navel of 84 are painted, and the geometric device between them can be taken neither as evidence for tattooing nor for a corselet; it is simply decorative. A red loincloth is worn. The decoration, white rosettes, is commonly found on this dress in Greece, and, for example, on Cypriot lime- stone figures. Its upper edge is decorated with a zigzag painted in a reserved band, hardly a belt since it rises sharply at the front. These fragments represent a decisive break with the tradition of hollow wheel-made figures whose appearance and anatomical detail were largely determined by their technique or by imitation of foreign models. Nor do the smaller, solid figures afford an adequate parallel or explanation, for they display neither the detail nor the approximation to monumentality shown by the 'thin men'. It is indeed as minor statuary that they must be judged; as the earliest examples of Chian archaic sculpture. Their proportions and long legs recall some bronzes 1 BSA xxxv ( 1 934-5) pl. 33- * 5- 2 They contrast with the tightly belted type of wheel- made figure which is already met early in the seventh century; e.g. Ohly, ii pls. 20-25, 29-32 passim; BSA xliv (1949) pls. 6-7 (Siphnos); Higgins, i pl. 72.542 (p. 148, the tight-belted type is doubted before the sixth century).

Very similar are the boots on a figurine 'from Asia Minor' whose ancestry is not clear (BM 1 907. 10-26. 1; BMCSculpture i.2 12 fig. 1; Schneider-Lengyel, op. cit., fig. 6); and, farther east, cf. Sendschirli i 55 fig. 17.</page><page sequence="212">CLAY FIGURINES 193 of the Late and Sub-geometric periods, but these lack the expression of corporeal volume attempted in the clay. Some of the earlier stone kouroi perhaps afford closer parallels for the long legs and thickset chests. All the fragments are from Period IV levels and a date earlier than the last quarter of the seventh century is unlikely. Imported Figures : Cypriot. As at Lindos, Délos and the Heraion at Samos Cypriot figures bulk large enough among the votives, particularly towards the end of the seventh century and at the beginning of the sixth.1 Indeed it seems that Cypriot imports swamped the East Greek markets at this time and may well have caused some local schools to stop production.2 At Emporio nearly one quarter of the fragments from the Harbour Sanctuary are Cypriot. They are all of Period IV and none needs be earlier than the last third of the seventh century. On the other hand a great number of the other figurines found can be assigned to the earlier years of the seventh century if not to the eighth, so that it seems possible that the Cypriot were in fact in the majority for the period of their vogue. Of the figures which can with certainty be identified, six are male, three female and one animal. None has any individual interest other than their simple presence on the site, and comparisons with their Cypriot kin are quoted in the catalogue below. Imported Figure Vases. The warrior's head and female bust vases, 101 and 102, are typical exam- ples of Maximova's Gorgoneion Group and well known on a number of East Greek sites. They were probably made in Rhodes. Their presence in Period IV here confirms the fact, once doubted by some, that the group has its origins in the seventh century. The warrior's head vases have been classified by J. Ducat.3 Ours is typical of his Group 1, and the fragmentary bust vase goes with those which he associates with that group.4 the later terracottas 103-155 (plates 80-83) The Athena Temple deposits yield most of the sixth-century and later figurines, and the majority of these is of the period from the construction of the Temple soon after the middle of the sixth century, to its reconstruction in the mid-fourth. At the end of the seventh century Cypriot imports were the dominant feature among the votive figures in the Harbour Sanctuary. In the sixth century the source is that East Greek centre which produced the many figures and figure vases best known from the cemeteries in Rhodes, but for which a mainland, South Ionian origin can perhaps now better be postulated. The superficial similarity of fabric makes it difficult sometimes to distinguish an import from a local product made in a mould derived from an import. An isolated Corinthian piece can be identified, 121. 1 Lindos i pls. 86-94; EADélos xxiii 46-51 ; Ohly i 57 ff. pls. 35-43; AM lxxvi (1961) 34; AA 1964, 223, fig. 3; BCH Ixxxi (1957) 614 f. ; E.

There are examples of both at Emporio, as well as examples from later in the century of a dove and a cock vase of the same family. 114 follows the general style of these figures but is probably a Chian invention. The offerings carried, a large deep bowl and a piglet, are not those usually found with such figures in East Greece. The himation hangs low, to below the knee, and the chiton is elaborately patterned over the chest. The thickset figure is unusual;1 drapery and head suggest a date little before 500. We have already seen an early archaic Chian example of a human head applied decoratively to a vase (62), and others may perhaps be identified.2 About 600 another series of such plastic embellishments begins with the heads on the upright handles of the Chian Aphrodite bowl from Naukratis. This is followed by other pieces dating from the succeeding half century. All, so far as can be ascertained, are from slipped black-figure vases. The practice of applying a head by upright loop handles was adopted in other wares, notably Clazomenian.3 In Chian the heads appear also on vase-feet and on the walls of other vases of indeterminate shape or purpose. To these can be added the example from Emporio, 115, from a lid. Chian vases or fragments with this applied decoration which are known to me are : 1. The Aphrodite Bowl. London. From Naukratis.

Their relationship to possible Chian examples in stone cannot be discussed here. Blinkenberg distinguished among the Lindos terracottas a class of late archaic figurines of women which he styled 'types gracieux'.1 The seated figures of this type are common in Rhodes, and are represented at Emporio by several fragments from the Harbour Sanctuary, 122-126. They belong to the early fifth century. A simplified version appears in the Athena Temple deposits, with foldless drapery and slim lines, 127.2 Here too a good head is preserved, showing the distinctive sakkos. The figures are seated on block-like stools, not chairs with backs as is usual. Among fragmentary heads from similar figures one is particularly well preserved, and the sakkos unusually long and pointed, 130. The stocky flautist, 118, is probably a local creation and belongs still to the sixth century. Pro tomes of women, so common on Rhodian sites, are represented at Emporio by one fragment only, 135, which, from the modelling of the ear, is likely to be of the early fifth century.3 The bust, 136, bears some relation to Rhodian bust protomes, but unlike them is not left open behind and the lower arms are not shown. The back of the head is modelled (not from a mould) into a long sakkos and the neck and upper back are closed. The poor state of preservation does not allow close comparisons for the head but the parallels suggested are rather with major sculpture than with clay figurines. The date should be about the middle of the fifth century. The chiton figure of the mid-fifth century, 137, affords a marked contrast with the earlier 'types gracieux', while the stocky peplos figures, both standing and seated, 139-143, seem more of a concession to mainland sculptural types. Such figures are met in Rhodes,4 but more com- monly in Attica or Boeotia. The complete example, 139, is notable for it shows that the standing figures were made from two moulds, front and back, unlike the Rhodian and mainland figures which in this period generally do not have moulded backs.5 If the piece is Chian, as seems likely, this may suggest some local conservatism in technique. The latest figures from the Athena Temple antedate its reconstruction, which they help to place in about the middle of the fourth century. The head of the dancing woman with the tambourine, 148, shows that the fifth century is already past but the figure and drapery betray nothing Hellenistic. The smaller figures, 149-152, derive from a widely copied and adapted type of the dancer with her arms wrapped in her himation. The Emporio figures own no very close relations and may be Chian inventions. THE EARLY TERRACOTTAS6 Hollow animal figures 25*. Fragment from the rump of a wheel-made figure of a horse. H. 12.2, W. 11.1. HS:H, Period I. Pink-brown clay; red paint on a cream slip. Wheel-marks within show that the body was built up on the wheel with the rump as base. The tail is represented by a vertical ridge. Holes are cut at either side of it for ventilation in firing. 26*. Wheel-made figure of a horse standing on a circular lid. L. 17.0, H. 14.3. HS:E, from the fill of the Late Roman plunder pit over the foundations of the classical temple. Pink-buff clay; red-brown paint on a cream slip. The body, legs and neck were made on a wheel. A serrated mane runs along the spine; the tail runs down the left leg. The rear legs stand on part of a wheel-made disc which is shown to be a lid by its outer flange, decorated with a simple key pattern. Too little is preserved to determine the diameter of the lid. The hollow of the legs runs through the lid. 1 Lindos i 518 ff. and cf. Higgins, i 518 on no. 109. 2 Similar figures were found in a deposit from a Demeter sanctuary in Chios town; cf.

METAL OBJECTS GOLD AND SILVER I56-I57 The dearth of gold and silver at Emporio in comparison with the many ornaments found in the limited excavations at Phanai indicates the comparative wealth of the two sanctuaries in south Chios.

LEAD 158-167 (plates 84-85) The pattern on the disc pendants, 158-159, is a common Greek orientalizing motif.1 The pendants themselves, both in material and pattern, are closely matched at Sparta2 where they imitate ornaments in precious metals, perhaps from earrings. There are also some notable Near Eastern lead roundels of this general type which may have served as a more direct source of inspiration.3 In the sixth century there is a group of East Greek lead medallions with figure decoration of a goddess on a lion's back closely modelled on eastern types; one is from Chios.4 Lead net- weights, like 160-161, are undatable except by context.5 At Emporio the same type is met in the seventh century a.d. 1 For these 'cup-spirals' see Jacobsthal, JHS lxxi (1951) 89 f., 93-95.

They were found in the Cella of the Athena Temple and I have argued above (p. 27 f.) that they may once have formed a decorative fringe to the peak of the helmet worn by the wooden cult statue of Athena. Stylistically they are later than the main series of fine griffin proto mes in bronze from Olympia ; later even than the main series of Samian griffins,1 which (or their like) were also known on Chios (see 390). Various features indicate this rela- tively late date though it must be remembered that their small size led the artist to exaggerate some details, notably the eyes. The tall biconical knobs on short stems resemble that on one of the bronze pro tomes from Phanai,2 which must be contemporary with the latest of the Samian series. The chin is rendered as an upcurving beak, not the sharply down-turned jaw which is most commonly found ; in this it resembles some of the earliest Greek griffin representations, notably the Aegina jug,3 and their Late Hittite models.4 Another peculiarity in the mouth is the rendering of the teeth in the upper jaw. No bronze pro tome has teeth but they do appear on some vases and jewellery,5 mainly from East Greece and the islands, and some oriental griffins.6 The suggestion of a mane on one of the protomes also reflects this eastern ancestry, and may look forward to the fifth-century Greek type with bristling mane7 but no forehead knob.8 The usual spiral ornament running down the side of the neck is not shown, but it might have been painted.9 The ears lie well back in a manner not met on the bronze protomes though they are often represented thus in vase-painting. The Emporio protomes seem then to stand between the last of the great series of bronzes, which come down into the first half of the sixth century, and the fifth-century types. A date in the middle of the sixth century seems most plausible. The griffins can be associated with the period of building the Athena Temple, and therefore perhaps with a new or newly accoutred cult statue within it. The choice of lead for the material is a strange one. The Spartan relief plaques which are cast in lead are well known,10 and with them were also found some statuettes in the round,11 but outside Lakonia lead statuettes or finials of this type are extremely rare in the archaic period.12 The use of lead here is easy to understand : it saved the need for a third or more moulds. The 1Jantzen, Griechische Greifenkessel and AM lxxiii (1958) 26 ff. Learned comment on these griffins has more than doubled in the last decade. Amandry in Syria xxxv (1958) 82 ff. refers to much of the literature in a good brief appre- ciation of the problems, and in AM lxxvii (1962) 56 ff. deals with the later archaic type. 2 ADelt i (19 1 5) 77 fig. 13.

This would of course have been impossible, or much more difficult with any other material. The heads and necks of the protomes were cast in one piece from two-sided moulds while the ovoid base and spike were cut from the soft metal afterwards. The ridge left by the join in the mould was carefully removed from most of them; on one the flange left was deliberately cut to represent a slight mane - a feature which has already been noted. The wedge-shaped pieces, 167, might also be from the fittings of the cult statue, and seem to have lain against a curved object. Their surfaces are not well finished, however, and seem to have no significant form. 158 J , {I XS J , ' .6, lAf^ 1 if fig. 134 Scale 2:3. 158*. Disc pendant, fig. 134. Diam. 0.026. HS:H, Period II.

FIBULAE 168-241 (plates 85-86) Nearly 250 fibulae were found at Emporio, and almost all of them in the stratified votive deposits of the Harbour Sanctuary. The main types and their history are shown in the chart, fig. 136. This must be interpreted in the light of the number of specimens of each type found and of the remarks which accompany the catalogue below. Some clear succession of types and chronology can be shown to hold good for Emporio, probably then for all Chios. The story elsewhere in East Greece is not likely to be much different, but though other sites have yielded a greater number and more varied fibulae, none affords such useful stratification. There are two main families of fibulae on the site. The asymmetrical 'island' type can be traced through various modifications in the sphere or knob (Types A-D) . Related are those with a simple bow (Type E) and with the five 'beads' on the bow (Type F) which have the longest life of all. The East Greek/Anatolian family are distinguished by their symmetrical bows, and often their T-shaped catch plates (Types G-K). These are related to the belt handles discussed below, pp. 214-17. At Emporio there are no fibulae as elaborate as the handles, although such were found at Phanai.1 The type of symmetrical fibula is especially associated with Phrygia, where most of the main varieties were already developed by the end of the eighth century, or at least by the time of the Cimmerian invasion in the early seventh century. It is not yet possible to say whether the type itself was invented in Phrygia or, as happened at other frontiers of the Greek world, whether 1 BSAtcxxv (1934-5) pl. 31.17, 23 etc.</page><page sequence="225">2O6 GREEK EMPORIO this was a Greek type which came to be more fully elaborated by the barbarian than by the Greeks themselves. The answer to this question lies in the early eighth century, at the latest, and is beyond the range of the Emporio finds. The symmetrical fibulae in East Greece in the late eighth and seventh centuries almost certainly reflect the influence of Phrygian taste, which can be observed in other metalwork, but they are found in such quantity as to preclude the possi- bility that they are all imports. The only known mould for a symmetrical fibula has been found in Greek Smyrna. It may seem surprising that we do not find in Ionia large and elaborate PERIOD AB E F LL-^-° I /' 70° h d c W) h j : _v_ m IV y K I 6OO fig. 1 36 Table of fibula types. fibulae to correspond with the Ionian belt-handles, although they could probably have been made from the same moulds. It may simply be that the heavy fibulae which are found in some quantity in Phrygia had no place in Ionian couture, which preferred the smaller safety-pins.1 Most of the Emporio fibulae were no doubt made in Chios, and as a result some common types here are not exactly matched elsewhere. Type M is certainly an import, and perhaps the more elaborate if not all of Type L, the spectacle fibulae. C. Blinkenberg's Fibules grecques et orientales will be often cited in this section, by the author's name only. 1 On Greek and eastern fibulae see Stronach, Iraq xxi (1959), 181 ff.; Muscarella, Expedition vi 2 34 ff.

Most are very simple; an ivory example, 238, had inlays of another material in the eyes of the major and minor discs. None need be earlier than 700, and I know none from any Greek site which are certainly of the eighth century. They copy spectacle fibulae of bronze spirals which begin earlier, though perhaps not much earlier in Greece or anywhere else.5 The decoration of incised circles and cables was learned from the Near East by Greek craftsmen.6 231.

In 250 the hoop is riveted; the spiral ring, 251, is incomplete. Very few are at all decorative. The spiral-ended type, of which three examples were found (254) is an early form. Others have been found in Greece at Olympia, Dodona, Thebes and Tegea, but the decorative device of the double spirals seems more at home in Europe. i The wire ring with a lover's knot (256) is a form with a very long history, from Mycenaean to Roman times.2 This example is from an archaic deposit, but the ring might be Mycenaean. The heavy rings are less easily matched and may not have been for personal wear but part of some equipment ; 3 they are far commoner in Italy. Two beaten bracelets carry typical Geometric decoration, one of punched dots (253), the other with tremolo (255) as on the fibula 168. Spiral bracelets, like 270, are common finds on Geometric sites.4 Someone had unrolled one of them (274), but it must be a bracelet, not a bucket handle or the like. The simple open bracelets are found at Phanai, and are common elsewhere.5 The elaborately decorated bracelets (261-266) are found in Period I and survive in Period II deposits. The pattern of circles, semicircles, triangles and bosses appears often at Olympia,6 and in north Greece.7 242*. Bronze rings; plain hoop with circular section. fig. 139.

Knob terminals. bronze belts 275-349 (plates 87-91) The discovery and identification of the bronze belts at Emporio are important for several reasons. From them it has been possible to identify parts of similar belts on other Ionian sites ; within only months of their discovery the American excavators at Gordion found their Phrygian forerunners, establishing another important link between Ionian Greek and Anatolian metal- work. And so far Emporio has yielded a greater number of belts with a greater variety of fittings than any other Greek or Phrygian site. I have fully discussed these belts and the finds in Greece and Phrygia in Anatolia vi (196 1) 179 ff., from which the following description is largely taken.1 A reconstructed drawing of the most complete example, in fig. 140, can serve as a text for the description of their construction and features. The main part of the belt is a continuous strip of sheet bronze with parallel sides, usually about 0.06 wide.2 The fragments show that not all were continuous strips but there could be riveted joins. They are undecorated except at the extremities, but along each edge there are small holes, presumably for sewing on leather or linen backing. Just beyond the holes on the face of the belt are lengthwise striations, neither very regular nor apparently deliberate. They may have something to do with the fixing of the backing or even the polishing of the strip. The backing was probably rolled over the edges mak- ing a raised border, top and bottom, such as is seen on many representations of metal belts. Cf. fig. 141. The strap- (as opposed to the hook-) end of the belt is terminated by a vertical strip riveted onto it. The ends of this strip are rolled forward much in the way that the backing would have been. The pierced bronze strap is itself fastened to the belt some distance from the end; on no one example is the complete distance preserved but it would have been about the length of the strap itself, and thus it is shown in fig. 140. The width of the strap is about three-quarters that of the belt. It has a rounded end, and along the centre a row of square holes into which the hook fitted. There are eight of these holes on 279, 9 on 309, 1 1 on 319. Circular holes appear ex- ceptionally on the fragments 321-323. On 279 the notch most used was reinforced by a flat plate of metal, fastened by seven rivets. Many of the straps are decorated with patterns of 1 And cf. The Greek Overseas 107 f. 2 The handle from Phanai, ADelt ii (191 6) 210 fig. 34, is the smallest of any of these belt members.</page><page sequence="234">METAL OBJECTS 215 small punched circles. The base of the strap narrows, with square shoulders, to a slim bronze plate which is riveted onto it. This plate is often grooved and incised; on 322 it takes the form of a bead and reel. From each end of the plate projects a spike fitting through pierced square knobs which are riveted into the main part of the belt. The strap is thus hinged onto the belt. The hinging is simpler on 319 which needed no plate (although it may once have had one). The point of attachment to the belt may be reinforced by a narrow strip folded round it, nr - '■ - '■ - '■ - s - ! - - • • L - i7: fig. 140 Reconstruction drawing of a bronze belt. Scale 1:3. fig. 141 Reconstruction drawing of a bronze belt, fastened. Scale 1 :^. beneath the hinge, as 329. Knob heads are sometimes found on the hinge pins and the rivets of the plate. At the other end of the belt the hook is formed by a straight sided bronze tongue, usually of one piece with the belt but in some instances made of a separate sheet of metal and riveted onto the belt. 301 has a forked base. The tongue has a blunt end at the centre of which a narrow flange is turned over to make the hook. The main part of the belt has two projecting wings at either side of the junction with the tongue;1 on 275, 279 and 298 there is also an angular projection at the base of the tongue. On the tongue itself there may be decoration of small punched circles matching that on the strap, a row of studs, compass-incised cable or simply 1 Compare the strap end of the sandals on the feet of the ivory statuettes at Delphi.</page><page sequence="235">2l6 GREEK EMPORIO an incised border. The only other decorations on the belts are the compass-incised rosettes in the arms of the handles (missing) on 294 and 295. The handles are the most distinctive features of these belts. They are fastened rigidly, at three points, onto the belt immediately behind the tongue. The point of fixing may be rein- forced at the back with strips or discs of bronze, as on 276. The handles are cast but the decora- tion of the bead and reel members as well as the incision is added afterwards. The rivets are mounted in rectangular or pyramidal members beneath the centre moulding on the hoop, and beneath each terminal, or the moulding behind each terminal. The underside of the handles is not decorated ; it is often flattened, sometimes hollowed. The known Greek types of belt handle may be broadly grouped by their terminals : on A to D they are circular, E to G rectangular, and H has animal-head terminals. The other determining factor is the number of mouldings on the hoop. Type A. Emporio, 275. Ephesos, perhaps Ephesus pl. 19.3 (a plate across the head as on the example from Old Smyrna, Type C). Three single bead and reel mouldings without terminals. The simplest form. HS, Period II. Type B. Emporio, 276-287. Phanai, BSA xxxv (1934-5) pl. 31-35« Three mouldings with one, two or three bead and reels on each. Compare the fibulae, Type J. On all but 276-278 and the example from Phanai there is a short collar between the terminal and the moulding behind it. 278 and 281 are very similar except for the collar on the latter; they differ from the others in having the end rivets beneath the terminals while the mouldings behind them are hollowed beneath. The terminals are incised as rosettes, except for 277 which is plain. On 287 the bow is cut on the upper side so as to appear twisted. HS, Period III (276, 279, 281), V (280), and IV (the rest) .

The hoop and moulding as Type C (Phanai) or E. Other parts of belts other than handles found outside Emporio may be briefly noticed. Samos: straps with cable pattern, or a cross-hatched border. Phanai: two tongues with hooks,1 one plain, the other with studs; also plain and decorated strips of belts.2 Some generalization can be made on the basis of this classification. When there are more than three mouldings they shrink to discs with segments cut out beneath where the others are flat. The presence of a 'collar' between the terminal and moulding is not significant, nor is the position of the rivets, though these are rarely on the terminals in Chios. Examples from Emporio and Phanai are much the same but there is a type (C) at Phanai only matched at Ephesos and Old Smyrna. Samos is distinct. Clearly then there were local schools of belt-makers in Ionia. None are earlier than HS, Period II. The earliest are simple (Type A) or odd (Type G). No significant chronological factors can be observed otherwise; the single example from a later context, 280, need not mean that they were still being made in the sixth century, though this is probable on other grounds. The earliest dedicated were probably not newly made, so some may belong to the late eighth century. Taking into account the other points, we find the punched- circle decoration on straps and tongues mainly in Periods II and III, so this may be an early feature; on the angular, small handles of Type D it seems late. Multiplication of mouldings, as on fibulae, may also be a sign of lateness. The relationship of these handles to East Greek and Anatolian fibulae is obvious, and they are clearly inspired by them; not, however, made from the same moulds, for, except for the smallest examples, there are no fibulae on Chios to compare with the handles for size and complexity.3 Their practical purpose is also quite different for they fasten nothing, nor could anything be readily suspended from them. Most probably their only use was to assist the wearer in drawing in his belt as tight as possible. This in itself is hardly sufficient reason for their presence, and it may well be that they represent the fibulae which fastened linen belts, like the giant safety pins at the waist of a kilt, and that they survived as decorative appendages on the metal belts. The ancestry and purpose of these belts have been discussed in Anatolia vi, where it was sug- gested that they were worn by women, and their survival into the sixth century was demon- strated by the appearance of one worn by the winged Artemis on an East Greek bronze relief from Olympia. 275*.

The wire has a rounded, sometimes ridged, outer section, and it is flat on the inside. The coils are so close set that they form a continuous tube. Many were found at Phanai.1 There are similar examples from Aegina, Crete, and in north Greece, at Vergina,2 and some- what larger ones from other Mainland Greek sites,3 which have been thought to be hair orna- ments. The small tight spirals found in Chios are exactly matched in seventh-century Etruscan tombs,4 although the fusiform spiral pendants in the same tombs5 seem not to have been found in Greece. The ornament was most common in Central Europe from a much earlier date, and ours may be from the same source as the fibula 240, or the pins 377-380; but they enjoyed a wide popularity in antiquity.6 The concentration of them in Chios is noteworthy. 376*.

The bead and reel on 382 is met on various Greek pins, and has its origin in the Near East, as Jacobsthal has demonstrated (op. cit., 44 f., 153 ff.). In fact our example is more readily matched by the pins or wands from Nimrud1 than by other Greek pins. 377. Roll pin. fig. 145. L. 0.067. HS:H, Period I. The head drawn and rolled. 378.

BRONZE VASES AND HANDLES 383-394 (plates 91-93) As so often happens, it is the handles and more solid trappings of bronze vases which have survived rather than the fabric of their bodies. The few pieces from Emporio are important. 383, with a bronze plate and loop holding an iron ring, is a non-Greek form. Its home is Phrygia, and this is most probably an import from that kingdom. At Gordion cauldrons with handles of this type were found in Tumulus III, dated to the end of the eighth century.2 The fragment, 384, might possibly also be from an imported cauldron. The handle is from a mid-seventh century deposit, but may have arrived in the island long before. Floral handles like 389 were among the most popular motifs adopted in Greek lands in the orientalizing period. They have been discussed fully by Jacobsthal.3 He indicates an ivory handle from Nimrud as a prototype,4 and there is a bronze example from the same site which could be as early.5 The principle is in itself of the simplest, as though the spike or knob which is found on some Bronze Age Greek handles6 had burst into flower. The Emporio handle differs from most in the form of its attachment to the bowl, in the height of its stem, and in the trans- lation of the bud into a human head. The last is a conceit worthy of an Ionian, or an Etruscan. Indeed it is in Etruria that we find bronze men rising from very similar flowers.7 The head itself, being no later than the end of the seventh century, is one of the earliest examples of figure-work in bronze from Ionia. There is a bronze statuette of the same date from Old Smyrna,8 and, in a different, sphyrelaton technique, statuettes from Samos.9 The goddesses from Ephesos (Ephesus pls. 14, 1 6.1) are later. Compare too the animal-head finíais on Chian belt-handles, which are seventh century. One griffin's ear (390) is meagre, but still fully adequate evidence for adding Emporio to the Greek sanctuary sites at which cauldrons with griffin protomes were dedicated.

OTHER MATERIALS clay votive shields 483-496 (plate 94) Mrs. Stilwell has discussed the practice of dedication and listed examples of clay votive shields in Corinth xv.2 216 ff.1 The only Ionian sites which have so far yielded specimens, apparently of local manufacture, have been the Heraion on Samos,2 Phanai in Chios3 and now Emporio. The Samian shields are all much earlier than the Chian, and although the shapes do not change greatly with time there is no common decorative factor to associate them except the simple concentric circles which appear on many shields from different sites and in different periods. The painted Chian example from Phanai4 seems of the latest seventh or first quarter of the sixth century b.c. Some from the Harbour Sanctuary at Emporio are certainly of the seventh century (Period IV), notably the fragment with the fish, 484. The only other distinctive pat- terns on the shields are the orientalizing motif on 492 and the whirligig on 483. Mrs. Stilwell discusses the latter5 which appears on other votive shields of the late seventh and sixth centuries, and of course on very many vase representations, including Chian.6 All have what seems to be a simple arm-grip, but only one, that with the whirligig, 483, a hand-grip. The half-and-half painting inside 493 is like the surface decoration of an Attic example.7 483*. fig. 153. Diam. 0.18. Athena Temple Cella, Period I. Pink clay. Black paint on cream slip.

CLAY WHORLS AND WEIGHTS 509-520 The most common variety of whorl is conical, with straight or slightly concave walls, and a bevelled lower edge. It was already in use in the eighth century, but was giving place to other types in the seventh. The examples from the Harbour Sanctuary deposits are about twice the size of those from the Athena Temple and houses on Prophètes Elias. The shape is characteristic of whorls all over Greece in the early Iron Age, and is a logical successor to the Late Bronze Age conical whorl of stone or clay. The degree of bevelling on some examples brings them close to the second most popular type, the biconical. 515 affords a very early example of the disc weight, so common later. The earliest examples of pyramidal weights, as 519 (first quarter of the sixth century), are from Athens1 and Siphnos2 where they are dated in the seventh century. For stone whorls see 529, 530. 509. Conical whorls with bevelled lower edge, sides straight or slightly concave, fig. 155. Heights range from 0.024 to 0.037, diameters from 0.027 to 0.031.

The ivory lion seal, 534, belongs to a small class of which the best example has been found at Phanai,1 with the device of a sphinx and man cut in a very similar style to ours, but with a better modelled lion. It was in a Late Geometric deposit. There are other examples from Rhodes, Ithaka, Delos and Paros and the type seems to be East Greek in origin.2 The oval seal, 535&gt; is of a related type.3 The scaraboid 536 belongs to a class with a wide distribution in the Near East, Cyprus, Greece, the west (Ischia) and Etruria. It was probably made in Cilicia and belongs to the end of the eighth century.4 There were several examples at Phanai.5 The scarab 537 is from quite another quarter. The device is purely Egyptian.6 It is accurately cut and understood, unlike the garbled versions of Egyptian symbols and hieroglyphs found on the imitative scarabs made in the Near East and later by Greeks. Ours must be from Egypt itself, possibly via Naukratis, for it had arrived in the island not long after the middle of the seventh century. Some of the faience scarabs might be from the sixth-century Naukratis factory, though not 538 which is too early.7 Note also the stone cylinder bead, 578. 534 535 536 537 fig. 160 Scale 2:1. 534*.

There are two main classes of glass beads in the votive deposits of the Harbour Sanctuary. In the first, represented by 540-545, the glass is pale green or brown, almost opaque, and is invariably well preserved. In the second class, 546-548, it is transparent, a pale green, yellow or white, and usually very poorly preserved, flaking and friable with much iridescence. So few of the green or brown beads of the first class were found in levels later than Period II that it seems most probable that they were not current much after the early seventh century. It is not easy to judge from publications how often similar beads have been found on other sites, although the unusual shape of 542, which might serve better as a button than a bead, appears at Ephesos. 1 The spherical beads of the second class, 546, have generally larger perforations than those just discussed. They are found in all Periods. Of the others the 'eye' beads, 551-552, are early examples of a type which is very common on Aegean sites in the Geometric and Archaic periods. The ribbed cylindrical bead, 554, is another early type of which examples are met in Crete and Rhodes.2 Amber. Amber beads were found in all Periods of the archaic deposits. There were in addition unpierced ornaments which may have been inlaid in another material; of these the commonest are drop-shaped, like examples from Ephesos and Phanai.3 The squatting monkey, 568, is an Egyptian motif much copied in various materials in Greece from the Late Geometric period on. Carved amber figures are rare in Greece. They have been found in Athens, Sparta, Perachora, Ithaka, Ephesos, Rhodes and Crete.4 The amber at Emporio is of the commoner type found at Ephesos and graphically described by Hogarth (pp. 213 f.) as 'more opaque and dusky red, of friable texture, glowing deep crimson when held up to the light'. The amber from Phanai exactly resembles that from Emporio, and a scrap which has been analysed5 contains succinite, and is therefore of Baltic origin. This may be held true of the Emporio amber also. There is as yet no evidence to suggest that a direct route from the Black Sea could have brought amber to East Greece as early as our Period I, so it is likely that it arrived via the Greek mainland. Indeed, it has been suggested that in Greece amber of this date was brought from Etruria, especially the amber- working centre of Vetulonia, where amber monkeys like ours are to be found.6 Glass 540-545 are of pale green or brown glass, rather like amber, nearly opaque, and seem to have suffered no change in colour i or composition. &lt; 540.

Despite the many Egyptian features in the other faience amulets these are all from a Greek workshop. Rhodes seems to have produced most of the figures of this type which have been found on East Greek sites.1 Here, and at Old Smyrna, they are found in clear seventh-century contexts, as also in some of the Rhodian graves. In the sixth century there was also a Greek factory at Naukratis whose products can be distinguished by their fabric as well as their inferior technique. These travelled less, although the faience scarabs from the same factory reached many sites. 579*. Fragment of a seated figure. H. 0.021. HS:H, Period IV. White composition, green glaze.

Its ancestry or kin are hard to seek for although the excellence of East Greek ivory carving is well attested by the finds at Ephesos and Old Smyrna,1 there are no first-rate examples certainly of this date which can be compared. The sinuous, almost fleshy lines of the horse can owe little or nothing to the rather hard, though realistic, modelling of the Near Eastern ivories which had found their way to Greek sites, including nearby Samos. Only in Protocorinthian vase-painting do we get some idea of the Greek artist's miniaturist treatment of animals, but here the eastern models strongly affect the drawing of felines, although less so that of horses. Even so, the mounts of the riders on the Chigi vase2 are stiff and doll-like by comparison with the ivory. Some of the characteristics which are generally attributed to later Ionian art seem to be presaged here. The horse's rounded muzzle may not be merely an expression of the artist's dislike of the angular, but an indication of species. In this feature the animal closely resembles the eastern breed represented in later Achaemenid and Scythian art.3 The discs and plaques cut from the skulls of cattle, 600-602, and bone points, 603, seem to belong only to Period II. They are not readily paralleled on other Greek sites nor easily explained.4 596*. Ivory horseman. L. 0.038, H. 0.034. HS:H, Period III.

The*strands of the tail are twisted. The rider's arms are broken at the elbow. Where the original surface is pre- served it shows sharp cutting and a good polish. 597*.

INSCRIPTIONS 613-640 (plates 97-98) The inscriptions on stone are published by Mr. Forrest in BSA lviii, lix (1963, 1964), and for masons' marks see the sections on architecture, above. In this section are to be found all the inscriptions on pottery, but minor graffiti are noted only in the pottery catalogue. The signifi- cance and restoration of the votive inscriptions are discussed on pp. 23, 62 f. and the name on 621 on p. 251. 613 is the earliest Chian inscription, of the earlier part of the seventh century b.c. The three inscriptions from the hand of Nikesermos (or his artist) are shown to be still of the seventh century by their find-places and the shape of the vases on which they are found - early chalices with low walls and low feet. The letters are small and neat, and form an interesting contrast with the later votive inscriptions from Emporio (622-628) and Naukratis.1 Nikesermos makes an angular rho and he rarely lengthens the hasta below the epsilon; his sigma is reversed, no doubt 1 Cf. Woodhead and Cook, BSA xlvii (1952) 159 if.; Boardman, BSA li (1956) 56-59; Jeffery, Local Scripts 338. R</page><page sequence="263">244 GREEK EMPORIO an idiosyncrasy. He already makes an open eta - the earliest Ionic examples to date;1 and he still uses koppa. On 621, which is not on a Nikesermos vase, a kappa is used where a koppa might well have been expected - before an upsilon. This piece should be of the first quarter of the sixth century. Thus the open eta and abandonment oí koppa appears on vases long before the date now generally given to the famous 'Constitution' inscription from Chios which has still closed eta and koppa.2 Even allowing for some conservatism in inscriptions cut on stone a date in the first quarter of the century might still be arguable for the 'Constitution'. The other votive inscriptions are contemporaries of the well known series on Chian kantharoi, phialai and chalices which have been found at Naukratis, Aegina and Phanai.3 These are of the second quarter and middle of the sixth century b.c. „_. ^'^^/ 613 619 629 ¿__^ / k^o^lY I 1 - / 63O 636 637 fig. 165 Scale 1:2. 613*.

Poi. vii 1330b, 17) It is uncommon to find in Greek lands an Archaic site whose plan and character can be so clearly determined and which lacks the obscuring complications of later building and occupa- tion. The Prophètes Elias township escaped such a fate by reason of its size and the proximity of more desirable sites for subsequent occupation. It may then be possible to study here in gen- eral terms, if not in detail, the pattern of early Ionian town life. The houses on the hill-slope could hardly have sheltered more than about 500 souls. The detail is therefore lacking, because we are dealing with what is barely more than a Kcbpri, hardly a ttóàis, and only in its walled acropolis improving on the primitive Greek town life which Thucydides envisaged in its vulnerable iroAecnv drreixioTois Kaì Kcrrà Kobras oiKounévaiç (i 5.1). For the same reason we can ex- pect to find here traces only of the major upheavals that Ionia suffered, and, as a provincial centre although perhaps an important port, experiencing only part of what Chios town, as a major Ionian state, might have suffered. The constituent parts of the town on the hill are very simple, and indeed fundamental to any early Greek settlement : a walled acropolis enclosing both the ruler's hall and the temple, and below it the houses of the townsfolk. The one thing not identified but which seems equally fundamental to Greek town life is the agora. For this in its primary function as an assembly place of the citizens we should probably look within the acropolis to the flat area between the Megaron Hall and the Temple - although it is questionable what importance any regular assembly might have in an apparent autocracy, and indeed whether there would be one at all, except for receiving orders. The commercial function of an agora could as well be fulfilled at some point down by the harbour, although we have no clear evidence for the nature and indeed area of Archaic occupation down there. It is, however, a reasonable assumption that after the hillside town was abandoned in about 600 b.c., the main centre of occupation was at the harbour side. That an agora could be thus associated on the acropolis with the 'palace' and temple rather than in the lower town is shown, at least for this early period, by Homer's Troy where the assemblies take place before Priam's palace gates év iróÂei dKprj (//. vii 345 f.), where also is situated the temple of Athena (//. vi 88). The agora by the harbour embellished with buildings in the later period of the town's prosperity and apparent security is rather as that of Homer's Phaeacians, who lived like gods, or at least like prosperous Ionians. The close association of 'palace' and temple is also in keeping with what we know of early Greek practice. Athena was the patron goddess of the king before she ever became saviour of the people, and her position as the guardian deity was so natural as to be hardly a matter of choice for an Ionian prince or his subjects. The need for a walled acropolis as a place of refuge is understandable in this area, and the many isthmus sites of early settlements in Ionia were chosen as much for the security they offered as the anchorages that accompanied them. It was probably not until the sixth century that an Ionian state like Chios could have any confidence in command of its own waters and we cannot know how far Emporio's chief was independent of the Chian metropolis or could enjoy its pro- tection. Thucydides' account of early piracy1 explains the need for a refuge which would deter 1 Thuc. i 5, in a description of conditions before the Trojan War, but one which probably better fits the Geometric period in Greece.</page><page sequence="267">250 GREEK EMPORIO marauding parties even if it could not withstand the attack of an army. Thus, the hill town could watch the harbour without being immediately detected from it. Very similar in this re- spect were the conditions of mediaeval Chios where the village houses clustered out of immediate reach of the sea around great square towers into which the whole population could retire with its livestock and provisions for the few days in which armed bands from ships terrorized and robbed the countryside. To turn from the appearance of the town to details of its early history we need to consider what little is known of the history of the whole island in this period. The earliest evidence of the Ionian Greeks in Chios has hitherto been the Late Geometric pottery from the temple site at Phanai1 on the south coast, none of which can be dated with confidence as early as the beginning of the eighth century. Some pieces of pottery of Pro togeome trie type2 might, however, be an indication of earlier settlement, but there is none from Emporio and it looks as though the south of the island may not have been reoccupied or at least settled in villages until the eighth century. It is hardly credible that the island was not occupied by Ionian or Aeolian Greeks earlier but in the absence of excavations in the earliest levels in Chios town and other Archaic sites in central and north Chios it is not possible to say how much earlier this could have been. At any rate the settlements at Emporio and Phanai may prove to be instances of expansion and development within the island rather than of newly founded towns of immigrants. There is certainly no question of continuity between the Mycenaean and the Iron Age settlements at Emporio.3 Thus far the material evidence : the literary evidence for the early period in Chios is unhappily slight but may support and illustrate the apparent origins and political character of our south Chian town. Current archaeological opinion seems to put the beginnings of the Ionian migra- tion and settling of the Ionian sites on the mainland and the islands as early as the tenth century,4 but there are still many places, like Chios, for which there is no clear evidence earlier than the eighth century. For Chios5 we learn from Ion, a Chian, that Amphiklos was its first king6 and was sent there by an oracle of Delphi from Histiaea in north Euboea; but it was not until the reign of his great-grandson Hektor that all the indigenous tribes in the island, the Abantes and Carians, were defeated or driven away under truce, and that Chios was accepted as a member of the pan-Ionian league. It could well be that the earliest Greek settlements in the south date from such a period of mopping up, archaeologically datable to the eighth century. Elsewhere, then, in Chios town or the north, there should be earlier Greek occupation, and in the south too some signs of the displaced population. Of neither is there as yet any certain trace. Wade-Gery dates Hektor to about 800, which is not too early for us, and his dates for Chians7 may perhaps be brought down a little since Chios, with some other north Ionian sites, may have been settled rather later than, for instance, Miletus. Whatever the circumstances of the first Greek settlements in the south of the island we at least know that there was a monarchy.

Mikkylos, the son of Heropytho, is a name which appears also in a list from Mesta in south Chios (BCH iii 318).

Such a feudal system of semi-autonomous families in different quarters of the island seems characteristic of much of its history, and indeed of Ionia. * It is tempting to look for the name of one of the lords of Emporio in the Kydros who dedicated a chalice in the Athena temple in the early sixth century. His name has royal Ionian connections,2 and there are other 'Neleid' names in Chios.3 Through the seventh century there are no events in the known history of Chios which we might expect to have influenced the life of the town at Emporio, and we hear only of scandals about King Hippoklos, war with Erythrai and aid to Miletus in her Lydian wars. By the end of the century Chios may have taken a major part in the foundation of the Greek trading town at Naukratis in Egypt,4 her pottery was beginning to appear on many, even distant, Greek sites,5 and the importance of the harbour at Emporio may have been enhanced although imports among the votives in the temples are still few and they may have served mainly local needs. While Kroisos was lord of Lydia he was dissuaded from attacking the seafaring Ionians and instead concluded with them a treaty of amity (Hdt. i 27), and when Cyrus tempted them to revolt they refused (Hdt. i 76.3). When Kroisos fell (546) and the Ionians sought the same terms of the Persians as they had enjoyed with Kroisos all were refused but Miletus (Hdt. i 141. 3-4) though Chios succeeded in ingratiating herself with the new masters of the mainland by the surrender of the rebel Paktyas to the Persian general Mazares (Hdt. i 156-61). Later, once Harpagos had subdued the Ionians of the mainland, who acquitted themselves like men, as Herodotus tells us (i 169), the frightened islanders submitted - among them presumably Chios. The subsequent period of Persian domination does not seem to have been one of oppression. We hear of a tyrant in Chios, Strattis, no doubt appointed by the Persians, who served Darius well by keeping open for him his way of retreat from his Scythian campaigns (Hdt. iv 138). This is the first indication of political change in Chios but for the inscription of the first half of the sixth century mentioning a ßouAfi ÔrmoaÍTi with other terms which suggest considerable modifications in the earlier monarchic and aristocratic system, if not necessarily either a full- blown democracy or validity for the whole island.6 The Athena temple was built at Emporio while Chios was Persian and the earlier stone temple by the harbour undertaken at the same time. The same was true of temple building at Phanai.7 The major events which must have had their effects on even the remotest quarters of the island were the Ionian Revolt of 499, which Chios supported whole-heartedly, and its tragic results. At Lade (494) one hundred Chian ships stood near the centre of the line and even when the Samians deserted they fought on ouk âOeXoKOKéovTeç and broke off action only after the loss of most of their ships (Hdt. vi 15). When the treacherous Histiaios heard of the battle he left the Hellespont and, with troops from Lesbos, landed in Chios and terrorized the island, still 1 Cf. Hunt, JHS Ixvii (1947) 74 f. 2 Compare Kydrelos, a son of Kodros and founder of Ionian Myus (Strabo xiv 633) ; names with the Kydr- root are not uncommon in Ionia and their similarity to Kodros and Kodridai (RE s.v. *Kodros' 987 f.) may not be entirely coincidental. One could well imagine Kydr- families wishing to be associated with the Kodrid traditions in Ionia, whence no doubt the Kydrelos parentage (above) and perhaps the Kydrolaos as settler of Samos from Lesbos, in what seems to be a pro-Aeolic invention of Ephoros recounted by Dio- dorus (v 81). In the same story Kydrolaos' brother settled Chios. 3 Forrest in Huxley, Ancient Ionians, 1 70, n. 1 4. 4 Roebuck, CP xlv 236 ff., xlvi 2 1 2 ff. 5 Cook, BSA xliv (1949) 154 ff., xlvii (1952) 159, n. 4 for the distribution of fine pottery.

At about this time the richer Archaic offerings in the temples end. Down by the harbour there is evidence that the late sixth-century temple fell, not to be replaced until towards the middle of the fifth century. I suspect that a similar catastrophe overtook the Apollo temple at Phanai in these years. 2 Some guesses can be hazarded about the economy of the Archaic town. Chios was tradition- ally an important vine-growing island3 and stories were told of how Oinopion, who had learned wine-making from his father Dionysos (Diod. v. 79) taught the Chians how to cultivate the grape and to make the first 'black wine' (Theopompos ap. Ath. i 26. b, c). The distribution of Chian wine-jars from the early Archaic period shows how much it was exported, and its im- portance in the economy of this part of the island may be illustrated by the offerings in the temple of Athena (above, p. 30) and later by a remark of Virgil about the excellence of the wine from this area.4 The collapsed walls of narrow terraces are apparent still immediately below the hillside town and even high on most of the hill-slopes around, certainly far more extensive than the present limits of cultivation - an observation applicable to almost the whole island. These may be mediaeval but equally well may suggest the extent of possible cultivation in antiquity since the population of the island in the Archaic and Classical periods and in the Middle Ages certainly exceeded its present size. These terraces may have supported vines or even mastic bushes, which yielded the second most notable product of south Chios, at least in later times. It is only here in all Greek lands that the variety of the Pistacia lentiscus which produces fine clear gum is grown, and attempts to trans- plant it to other parts of the Aegean have failed.5 The earliest record of its export from Chios appears in Pliny, where its superiority to other varieties is clearly expressed 'laudatissima autem Chia candida' (jvi/xii 72). In ancient times one of its main uses seems to have been medicinal, but it was later jealously guarded by the Turks for export only to the mainland and Constanti- nople where it was popular in the harem as a chewing gum which both sweetened the breath and kept the teeth clean. It had aphrodisiac qualities also,6 and in the late seventeenth century a Frenchman, de la Motraye, records his attempt to persuade English gentlewomen of his acquaintance to renounce the disagreeable habit of chewing tobacco for mastic: 'elles l'ont éprouvé et s'en sont fort bien trouvées.'7 But we lack direct evidence of its cultivation in Chios in Classical times though this seems highly probable and it was certainly known as a tree by Herodotus (iv 177) who compares its fruit to that of the lotus. As well as the uses to which it was put later there are two other purposes it may have served in antiquity, though I am not able to judge the probability of either : one is as an alternative to pine resin added to wine, for it is known that retsina was made in antiquity from deposits found in wine jars; the second is a suggestion 1 Hdt. vi 26. He landed at Koila (èv KoíÀoict) and used Polichne as a base. Neither site is certainly identified but his operation may have been confined to the north of the island. The site Koila in north Chios seems wholly medi- aeval, is high and far removed from the sea, but ancient Koila may lie somewhere below it in the valleys between Kardamyla and Delphinion. 2 Ant.J. xxxix (1959) 186. 3 A full discussion by Zolotas in Mcrropia Tfjs Xíou A. i 200 if. 4 Georgics ii 98 'rex ipse Phanaeus'. 5 See Steier in RE s.v.

Another type of resin, Chian turpentine, is less distinctive than the Chian mastic, but of high quality and it has been identified by analysis in XXVI Dynasty Egypt,1 so it too may have become an important export at an early date. Olives were certainly cultivated in Chios and in the sixth century Thaies was able profitably to corner the presses both in Chios and Miletus (Ar., Pol. i 1259a). Corn too was grown but it seems likely that Chios had need to import grain,2 at least from the end of the seventh century, and to this end the importance of the harbour at Emporio might have been considerable both for the export of wine, olives and perhaps resin, and the import of grain to feed a population engaged in the cultivation of other crops. In fact the economic state of Chios in this period cannot have been much unlike that of Attica where the cultivation of wine and olive led to an increasing need for the import of corn. Roebuck's calculation of the size of Chios's population at the end of the sixth century3 was about 96,000 citizens, not counting the slave population which was reported to be considerable.4 His figures tally well with the known population of mediaeval Chios5 which seems to have been equally prosperous, and are on the whole accept- able. There were certainly more mouths than the corn production of an island interested in other agricultural products could feed. The grain might have come from the Black Sea or Egypt.6 Finally there is the problem of an ancient name for the site at Emporio. No inscription from the excavation names it but for a late mediaeval tombstone in which its present name appears in the form Emporeios (see below) . Nor does any ancient author describe or mention a site in south Chios which can with complete certainty be identified with Emporio. The present dis- cussion can then deal only with the limited possibilities which are offered. First it is worth considering the name Phanai and its application to the whole of this area of south-east Chios, including Emporio. The name is associated in ancient writers with a temple, a harbour and a cape in Chios. The cape is undoubtedly that now called Cape Mastiko, the south- eastern extremity of the island, and the temple has been identified by excavation at Kato Phana,7 a site nearly 11 km. north-west of the cape on the south coast of the island. Emporio is half that distance from the cape and north of it on the island's east coast. It is not immediately relevant here to decide whether the cape gave its name to the temple or vice versa, though I 1 Lucas, Anc. Egyptian Materials and Industries (1962, ed. Harris) 321, 323 f. ; cf. CVA British Museum viii 59 for a vase in which it was found at Daphnae (but not 'mastic'). 2 Roebuck, CP xlv 236 ff. and cf. Ionian Trade and Coloniza- tion 41. He may underestimate Chian local resources. By the late sixth century she had Atarneus and corn lands in Mysia in return for the surrender of Paktyas to the Persians (Hdt. i 160) though the produce, like blood money, was not used for a while for sacred purposes. Histiaios victualled his army there (Hdt. vi 28.2). They also certainly enjoyed a peraia on the mainland opposite, over which they came to blows with Erythrai (see below). Probably also the grain resources of the Pontus were open to them through the Milesian colonies there: Herodotus records the favourable relations between Miletus and Chios (i 18.3; cf. JHS xlix (1929) 21 f.), Chian interest in the Pontus is attested by the not inconsiderable finds of her pottery there and in the second half of the sixth century the two states were among the most medized of the Ionians. Some architectural fea- tures in the Black Sea colonies recall Chian work; cf. Ant. J, xxxix (1959) 190 f., Arch. Reports for 1962-3 45. 3 He reckons from the size of Chios's war fleet at Lade; Ionian Trade and Colonization 22. 4 E.g., Thuc. viii 40.2. 3 Apparently up to 120,000 (Argenti, Lhius Viñeta 248 fi., Folk Lore of Chios ii n 26 f.). The population in 1961 was 62,000. 6 Roebuck, CP xlv 236 ff., suggests that the currency with which it was bought derived from Chian trade with the Thraco-Macedonian area where she had a colony (Maron- eia) . But she may also have sent wine to Egypt. Herodotus' statements about the production of wine in Egypt are contradictory (ii 37.4; 77.4) but he does speak of its import from Greece (iii 6.1) and we know that Sappho's brother Charaxos carried Lesbian wine to Naukratis (Strabo xvii 1.33). For Chian wine imported in the third century see Rostovtseff, A Large Estate in Egypt 95. The Chian wine jars found in Naukratis date from its foundation and may not represent only local consumption. 7 Kourouniotes, ADelt i (191 5) 72 ff., ii (1916) 190 ff.; Lamb, BSA xxxv (1934-5) I3^ ff«</page><page sequence="271">254 GREEK EMPORIO believe the latter the case. The fact that the name was applied to two places so far distant suggests that it was as likely as not applied to the whole area: Thanaeus' is used of Chian wine by Virgil (see above) and if considerable cultivation was practised in this area in antiquity it would have flourished at least as readily in the low land around the modern Pyrgi, Dotia and Emporio as near the hilly Phanai; what is more the mediaeval Ano Phana is on the farther side of Pyrgi some 7 km. inland from its seaside namesake, implying the existence of the ancient name also thus far inland and not the usual relationship of an 'upper' and 'lower' village.1 If the name itself does not derive from Apollo Phanaios2 it may be understood to refer either to the çocvai of a lighthouse at the cape, or adjectivally ( = çcceivocí) to the glistening white rocks. If the name is as old as the cult, which seems likely, the former explanation is improbable unless we can impute to Chios a developed maritime and coastal watch system in the eighth century: however, the whiteness of the earth and rocks in this part of Chios and the opposite mainland is both obvious today and apparent in ancient and modern place names (Aspra Chomata, Ar- gennon, Leukonion) . 3 The bright rocks are conspicuous still at the cape, but become more marked as the seafarer continues along the coast from the cape ; not, however, towards Phanai, where the coastline is gently hilly, but towards Emporio. As Strabo mentions the deep harbour at Phanai in the same breath as the temple4 it is impossible to assume that they may not be in the same place, but the harbour at Emporio, though smaller, is deeper than that at Phanai, better sheltered and suited for ancient shipping5 as well as being on the main north-south shipping lane down the Asia Minor coast. Its easy communication with the hinterland makes it the obvious point for trade, and whereas neither excavation nor surface observation reveals a settlement of any size at Kato Phana6 in the period of its recorded use by Roman fleets7 there is ample evidence of occupation at Emporio. To sum up, it seems probable that Phanai was a name applied gener- ally to the south-east corner of Chios and that Emporio was a major if not the most important harbour in it. Of names for the site itself rather than the area there are very few associated by ancient authors with the early history of the island which are not confidently located elsewhere. Kaukasa was the port in which Megabates held his ships in readiness to cross to Naxos with the north wind (Hdt. v 33 f.) and on the strength of this many have placed it in the south of the island:8 but an in- scription from the north of the island mentions Trjpòs Ka[u]Kccaé[cc]s,9 the name Kaukasio10 is known there and a place name Kaukara11 recorded near Kardamyla in the north. Leukonion or Leukonia, Whitetown, has also been sited at Emporio. It is an attractive name for a town whose most conspicuous feature is the whiteness of the coast near by, and the name's 1 In other words Ano Phana is not an 'upper' village deriving perhaps in the Middle Ages from the seaside town, but an older foundation, presumably as old as its name. It is also difficult to see how such an Upper Phana village might arise beside the great mediaeval town of Pyrgi were it not already established as a site and name, and in fact the proxi- mity of Pyrgi has proved its ruin and it is no longer occupied (Zolotas, A.i 317, where similar names, Phanoudi etc., in this part of the island are recorded) . 2 Kontoleon argues this in AE 1952 208 f. and identifies it with the Chian Delion of a fifth-century inscription.

Plutarch (MuL virt. 244e-245c) tells the engaging story of its foundation. King Hippoklos of Chios was murdered at the wedding of a kinsman after behaving in a drunk and disorderly manner, upon which the groom's friends who had jointly confessed to the murder were sent from the city : ccttcókictccv eis AevKcovíccv, f^v Kopcoveïç àçeXónevoi irpÓTEpov eicrfiaocvTo jjet' 'EpuOpaícov. From this it appears that Leukonion should lie in a position in which Chios, Erythrai and the Koroneis might have an interest. This, I would suggest, is more likely to be on the mainland opposite Chios, the Erythraian peninsula, l than on the island itself, particularly as its colonists were in a way un- desirables.2 The southern arm of the peninsula which stretches across towards Chios city was called Argennon, the Shining, and Leukonion Whitetown could well be somewhere here. Strate- gically a base on the other side of the straits giving access to Chian waters from the south would be desirable, just as the Oinoussai islands served in the north. Economically, as we have already noted, Chios would have need of a peraia to supply some of the grain she lacked. Other factors lend weight to this assumption. After the story of its founding Plutarch goes on to tell of the bravery of its women in a war with Erythrai, as though Leukonion was an important objective, as it would be for Erythrai if on her mainland peninsula.3 Of the Koroneis we know little enough but they are probably the Koloneis who Strabo says lived in Erythraia,4 and a cape Koryna5 on the Erythraian peninsula is mentioned by Roman authors and might be associated. In an inscription of about 200 b.c., listing property whose revenue was apportioned by Attalos I for building in Chios, estates are mentioned êv Af.jiJiynÔcciç Aevkcovíois and, immediately before and after this item, other property ê-rri ríspaía.6 Some items at least seem to be grouped in an approximate topographical order in the inscription and this association strongly suggests that Leukonion should be sought somewhere on the Chian peraia. The Athenian fleet raided the island and joined battle at Volissos, Phanai and Leukonion (Thuc. viii 24.3), that is, by the harbours of the west and south-east coast, and, if my assumption is correct, the Chian base across the eastern straits. Another circumstance which seems to link these place and tribe names is their recurrence and association in Aeolic-Boeotian traditions.7 Thus we find Athamas,8 son of Aiolos, ruler of the area of Laphystion, Koroneia and Haliartos in Boeotia. Two of his sons were called Leukon and Erythrios: Leukon himself begat Erythrai, eponym of the Boeotian town, and his grandson is Argynnos. Many Mainland Greek names recur in Ionia, most no doubt carried with them by the Greek settlers, so we can hardly be surprised at the topographical 1 Cf. Kiepert, Spezialkarte vom westlichen Kleinasien VII and the plan in A TL i 486 fig. 1 90. 2 For this reason the modern place-name Leukonia only 3 km. south of the city is not admissible. The position is on the outskirts of the ancient city cemetery (cf. Zolotas, A. 1 313 f.; BSA xli (1940-5) 32 f.) and the nearest ancient site should be Posidion (Strabo xiv 1.33, 35) at Cape H. Eleni. At any rate I can find no evidence to suggest that the modern place name is older than the nineteenth century. It may have been christened thus by a Chian scholar with an eye to the ancient topography of the island. There is no village there or traces of occupation and the vivid reports of walls, cisterns, etc., beneath the waters may well be as supposititi- ous as the name. Cursory examination with goggles from the surface reveals little, and reliable local inhabitants lend no support to the theory of an underwater city there; cf. BSA Ivi (iq6i) 106. 3 Her interest lay mainly in the northern part of the peninsula where the towns associated with her are sited; cf. map in A TL, loc. cit. 4 xiii 589; Dittenberger, Syll. 10 14, 1.64 restores Aiíurp-poç èy K[oÀcovaï]ç on an Erythrai inscription. 5 Pliny, NHv 117; Mela i 17.3. 6 Zolotas, 'Adriva xx 167, 1.25 ff. A peraia should be pera, Opposite', and in this case is better sought in the southern arm of the Erythraian peninsula. ATL i 486 f. refers to Atarneus as the Chian peraia. Chios had held Atarneus and cornland nearby in Mysia but this was opposite Lesbos, never referred to as her peraia, and at any rate not Chian in the third century. 7 There are several reminiscences of Boeotian names in Erythraia, and Chios at least seems to have lain within an Aeolic sphere of influence before it was admitted to the Ionian League. 8 The name was sufficiently associated with Chios to be given to a son of Oinopion who was said to have settled Chios from Crete (cf. Kontoleon, Rev. de Phil. 1949 6 if.).</page><page sequence="273">256 GREEK EMPORIO connection in Ionia of names which are also associated with each other in the west. * These argu- ments for the placing of Leukonion are not, of course, conclusive, and if Emporio proves to be Leukonion it will demonstrate a most intimate interest in the island on the part of Erythrai and a good casus belli between the states. Of places appearing in the inscription which also named Leukonia Zolotas chose Aí[¿r|v for Emporio,2 with little conviction. Forrest, arguing from the same inscription, suggests Karidai.3 This depends upon survival of approximately similar place names and requires some at least of those appearing in the context with Karidai to be certainly located. But Karidai remains a possibility. So many ancient place names survive in modern Chios that we cannot reject the final possi- bility, that Emporio is another of them. Stephanus of Byzantium knew four Emporions, the Massiliot colony in Spain (Ampurias), and towns in Macedonia, Sicily and Campania. Most of these would appear to be names given by Greeks to ports in which they established trading posts but there is evidence that the term, if not the proper name, could be applied to home trading ports equally well. A particularly illuminating example of this occurs in Herodotus' story (i 165) of the bid by the Phocaeans to buy the Oinoussai, the Chian islands between the north of Chios and the mainland. They were refused because the Chians feared that they would establish a rival enTTÓpiov there.4 In the site's capacity as a port it could well qualify for the name Em- porion. The market of Chios town was called Emporion in the Middle Ages and this too may be the ancient name for that quarter of the city.5 A fifteenth or sixteenth-century Greek portulan6 mentions a Kaßo Mirópeio which suggests that the name could be transferred to the south cape. Somewhat later is the tombstone7 of the priest who built the small church on the acropolis by the harbour at Emporio, erri t[co]v [ccJvccctkocccúv á[px]ccías -nróÀefcoç] 'E[jnrop8Í[ov, 'on the ruins of the ancient town of Emporeios' which should refer to the Late Roman fortress there, destroyed by the Arabs in the mid-seventh century.8 Whether Emporion could have been the name of our site from its beginning is not easy to judge although its convenience for trade must have been a factor in its choice for development. But it is still not too late to hope that a site which has yielded so much evidence for its occupation over four millennia might yet render a further detail of its history, its ancient name. 1 Sakellariou explores these connections in La Migration grecque en Ionie 197. 2 'AotìvSxx 1 77 f. 3&amp;S^lviiiriQ6^62f. 4 Herodotus' use of the word is discussed by Roebuck, CP XIVÌ215. 5 Zolotas, A.2 38 f. 6 Delatte, Les portulans grecs ii 245. 7 BSA lix (1964) 37 no. 33, pl. 4¿. 8 The eighteenth-century traveller van Egniont describes ruins and a dedication to Artemis which must refer to Kato Phana (the inscription is BSA lviii (1963) 60 no. 12), but says that the castle is called Emporium (Argenti and Kyriakides, 759). But he apparently described the circular watch towers (vigias) as castles and this confusion or trans- ference of the name appears in later maps also where the bay next to Kato Phana is labelled Emporio (Kiepert, Speziai- karte Vil; Paspates, Xiockòv fÀcoCTcrápiov Plan).</page><page sequence="274">INDEX OF FIND PLAGES AND DEPOSITS HARBOUR SANCTUARY Period I- pottery: 1-7, 9, 11-22, 24, 111-12, 114, 115, 119, 122, 124, 126-7, 138, 142, 156,4, 157?, 166, 170-1, 179, 181, 190-1, 193-4, 207, 221, 223, 289, 303, 308, 346, 350, 360, 369, 382, 437-40, 466, 483, 485, 524-5, 527-32, 535- 6, 543-5, 612; other finds: 25, 161, 163, 168, 170, 175, IÖ3, 189-90, 195, 203, 206, 242, 245, 247, 253-4, 260, 263-4, 266-7, 270, 272-3, 304, 364, 376, 377, 391, 395, 397, 426, 445, 449, 457"8, 460-1, 463, 482, 509, 511, 515, 523, 540-6, 549-50, 555, 560, 564, 567, 570, 572, 577, 608.
