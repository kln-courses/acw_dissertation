In the last two centuries artists willingly played several roles: aesthete, dandy, poet, and priest. Indeed, the his- tory of modernism is inconceivable without those men and women who believed they were a breed apart, prophets of a new art. The role of soldier, however, is one apparently at odds with the creative urge, or at least with popular conceptions of the artist. Those few individuals who served their country in wartime stand out immediately, and we need to pay attention to their stories because they significantly complicate our understanding of modernism. Instead of advocating an aesthetic removal from the world, they used their art to confront the disagreeable and often horrifying behav- ior of humanity. No American mastered the role of soldier better than H. C. Westermann (1922-1981), who is currently the subject of two comprehensive retrospectives.' One chronicles his considerable sculptural production, and the other presents his entire oeuvre as a print maker. Together these exhibitions, and the catalogues that accompany them, offer the most ambitious attempts yet to measure and explain the achievement of a figure whose art remains as complex and ambiguous as the world in which he worked. Throughout his life Westermann encountered an America that was riddled with contradictions. The severe economic hardships of the Depression were fol- lowed by unprecedented but unevenly distributed affluence. Triumphant global conquest in a just war did not prevent stalemate in the next or a humiliating .:.. ~.:.... ... .~d . :.. .....? .. .. ..... . AiL. H. C.

Democratic leaders used the power of the federal government to try to provide economic security and support for Amer- ica's citizens through Social Security, the GI Bill, and funding for artists, while Richard Nixon used the power of the White House to break the law and obstruct justice. The promise of enfranchisement for all was often stymied through racial persecution and prej- udice. A mythic American landscape was celebrated in literature and film while the real one was destroyed by overdevelopment and pollution. It was a world of heroes and villains who honestly believed they were working in the best interests of the country. Wester- mann's art registered all of these contradictions and often railed against the postwar perversion of the American Dream-summarized in President Roose- velt's four freedoms-for which so many men of his generation fought and died. Westermann's experience in two wars placed him at the very center of this complex time. A marine who served as an anti-aircraft gunner aboard the carrier USS Enterprise during World War II and who later saw extensive ground combat in central Korea, he knew the sacrifices his generation was asked to make to stem 43</page><page sequence="2">4.s .......A ... .o . . i i .... ...... .. . .... m m m mmmm~ .m. . .................... ....... . mm m m. mm . m ......m.. H.

Like many fel- low combat veterans (the novelists Joseph Heller, James Jones, and Norman Mailer, for example, or the president they most admired, John F. Kennedy), West- ermann recognized that the defense of democratic free- doms often necessitated undemocratic means. The result, as so many creative individuals of these years recognized, was a situation in which, paradoxically, a rigidly hierarchical military system-Westermann termed it "fascistic" -was used to preserve political freedom.2 Westermann had firsthand experience with military discipline. He was charged with abandoning his post, drunkenness on duty, and resisting arrest on 21 June 1945 while the Enterprise was undergoing repairs in Bremerton, Washington, following a kamikaze attack. He was tried and convicted in a summary court martial on July 4th while the rest of his countrymen celebrated the nation's independence. Ironically enough, he later received a good conduct medal for his exemplary per- formance in the months before his fall from grace. None of this stopped him from reenlisting in the Marine Corps in the summer of 1950, although his motivation for doing so was, perhaps, one of despera- tion after his second marriage failed.4 Most impor- tantly, Westermann's seminal experience with combat and militarism profoundly affected his sense of the individual's plight in a hostile world. It also allowed him to profess admiration for stoicism in the face of adversity while admitting that he himself was little more than "a fucking coward" when it came to com- bat.I Such contradictions can make writing about Wester- mann exceedingly difficult. For more than forty years the critic Dennis Adrian, who contributed essays to both catalogues, has noted that his work does not eas- ily fit into specific schools of postwar American art.6 Expressionism, Neo-Dada, Pop, New Imagism, and Funk are all appellations that begin to situate Wester- mann within a particular sensibility, but all signifi- cantly fail to encompass the depth and diversity of his work. He is hard to pin down, which may account for the obstacles scholars confront when assessing his his- torical importance and impact on other artists. As Adrian notes, we need to embrace a "both/and" approach to his work, rather than the "either/or" dichotomy that still plagues much writing about Amer- ican art in the postwar decades, and he argues that Westermann needs more scholarly attention. However, Adrian further suggests that Westermann's oeuvre will always elude the interpretive conclusions of such attention.7 This makes him both attractive and precari- ous as a subject of investigation. The idea of paradox is central to Adrian's interpreta- tion of Westermann's sculpture.8 At one point Adrian nicely summarizes the clash of sensibilities in a partic- ular sculpture as a combination of mawkishness and toughness-"the dash of sugar in the vinaigrette," as he puts it.9 The contrast neatly identifies opposition as a structural and thematic element that Westermann worked to great effect. Such opposition can be assessed by reviewing West- ermann's Death Ships, a group of about twenty sculp- tures he made between 1955 and 1980. These works use the theme of the damaged and imperiled ship to evoke Westermann's time at sea. Sometimes menaced by sharks, placed within a coffin, or struck by torpe- does or kamikazes, the ships are haunting reminders of the transience of life. The also invoke the rich history of seafaring literature, with which the artist was most certainly familiar. One way to conceptualize the oppo- sition within these works is to focus on their size in relation to the actual ships on which he served. The Death Ships, which measure from twelve to thirty-four inches in length, fall within the aesthetic category of the beautiful, which immediately suggests its opposite, namely the sublime, here identified with modern tech- nology.'0 The war ships with which Westermann was familiar were enormous; the Enterprise stretched some nine hundred feet from stem to stern. Once we recog- nize the dual focus of the Death Ships and begin to fac- tor in their debt to literary precedent, we see that they often celebrate opposites: fear and fortitude, elegance and vulgarity, beauty and ugliness, the intimate and 44</page><page sequence="3">the awesome, innocence and experience, chance and fate, and the individual and the state. Although this particular group of sculptures is intensely personal, drawing as it does on his time in the Pacific, it also has deep and far-flung cultural resonance and can easily be read as an allegory of the individual's perilous journey through a hostile world. The great merit of Wester- mann's approach to making art is that he refused to resolve conflicting ideas and so made it evident that such contradictions were also inescapably present in American culture. This is not to suggest that Westermann must be understood solely as an American artist. For too long he has been isolated as something of a mythic figure, a combination Popeye-Ishmael whose life was a series of challenges overcome." Instead, as the curator Robert Storr argues in his catalogue essay, Westermann must be situated within the discourse of the grotesque.12 This is not the first attempt to link Westermann with the grotesque; Max Kozloff made a similar point in 1968.1' The difference between his essay and Storr's, both of which are heavily indebted to the criticism of Charles Baudelaire, is that Storr had the benefit of three more decades of art that fits in the category. Whereas Kozloff tied Westermann to a long history of vernacular expression in American culture, Storr suggests that it is time to think about Westermann as part of an anti- idealist sensibility in modern art that stretches from Goya to Mike Kelley. Storr's is an important argument because it lifts the artist out of a narrowly American context and places him within a broader and much more complicated environment. I hope this line of inquiry will be developed further, if not by Storr, then by other scholars. When both authors suggest that any attempt to sum- marize Westermann's entire oeuvre must encompass stylistic complexity, obvious social commentary, and highly personal symbolism, it becomes clear just how difficult it is to render historical judgment on his place and importance in postwar American art. The publica- tions clearly wrestle with this challenge. On one hand the catalogue essays promise a general, yet substantial, introduction to his art and life; on the other, the cata- logue raisonn6 entries provide detailed readings of spe- cific objects and images. In the MCA catalogue, Lynne Warren's essay addresses the sculptor's time in Chicago, from 1947 to 1961, while Michael Rooks's focuses on the studios and house Westermann built in Brookfield Center, Connecticut. Both essays offer important insights on the artist, but neither one was intended to be comprehensive. Lacking throughout the publications, I think, is a thorough biography that interweaves the general with the specific, the times and ideas that motivated the artist, and the clear evidence of this in any given sculpture or print. Perhaps this is inevitable when several scholars contribute to a publi- cation. The catalogues contain some inaccuracies, inconsis- tencies, and omissions. For instance, we read in the MCA catalogue that Westermann rejoined the Marine Corps in 1950 and 1951 (the correct date is 1950) and that he moved to Connecticut in 1961 and 1962 (again the former date is the correct one). We know that he read widely and, as Rooks makes clear in several cata- logue raisonne entries, that several sculptures and prints refer to specific texts. However, none of the con- tributors mention the importance of two key novels Westermann discussed in a 1966 interview with the curator Martin Friedman: James Jones's From Here to Eternity (1951) and Herman Melville's Moby Dick (1851).14 Both novels profoundly affected Wester- mann's thinking about masculinity, fate, and the plight of the individual in hostile institutions, and both helped him to articulate his discontent with cold-war America by providing well-known narratives to which he could refer. The point is that when confronted with such undeniable complexity, scholars need to be both general and specific to find a way into his work, and they need to identify clear, material evidence support- ing any theoretical and historical narratives guiding their inquiry. One of the daunting tasks in writing about Wester- mann is that the references in any individual sculpture are nearly impossible to exhaust. For instance, The Evil New War God (S.O.B.) (1958, Whitney Museum of American Art) is correctly described in the catalogue raisonne of objects as a scathing critique of American cold-war hypocrisy. Rooks observes that the general configuration of the face resembles a well-known pro- paganda poster from World War II.15 However, the number of other references built into the sculpture is astonishing. For example, the text inscribed on its sur- face, "IN GOD WE TRUST," was already stamped on American currency, as Rooks also notes. Thus the sculpture can be identified as a personification of the United States threatening to wage global war while shamelessly hiding behind the justification of divine guidance. Additional markings complicate this reading. The five-pointed star scratched into one arm of the sculpture alludes to a tattoo on Westermann's left hand, clearly identifying the work as a self-portrait. In the sculpture, Westermann both condemns his country as an international bully and implicates himself as part of the military machine. This latter point is made more emphatically in a preliminary study that includes the dates of his service in World War II and Korea and the two bluebird tattoos that he had on his chest. The general configuration of Evil New War God takes the form of a blockhouse, a freestanding structure con- structed of heavy timber or reinforced concrete typi- cally used for military defense. Westermann might have known such a structure in several ways. First, a photographic essay on the sites of the American War of Independence, including the blockhouse of Fort Nelson north of Albany, New York, appeared in Life Magazine in 1957.16 Given his willingness to draw inspiration 45</page><page sequence="4">?  :................ .. . . . .-.... . .',. . :. ........ . .......... .. ........ . . .. . .. ....o.. ................

It was a motif that could be linked both to the conquest of the New World in the eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries and to the imperialistic desire to con- trol the economic and political fate of the Far East in the twentieth. Westermann sagely deployed the block- house to compare the past with the present in an ironic maneuver that suggested a rift between the myth of American honor and the reality of cold-war machina- tions. I could easily go on with the list of references in Evil New War God. The combination of anthropomorphic elements with architectural form evokes the bizarre configurations envisioned by Otto Dix, Max Ernst, and George Grosz following the end of World War I. For these German artists, the horrors of the Great War transformed humans into mechanical monsters, cyborgs without feeling who wantonly destroyed life, and their own humanity, with impunity. No doubt the motif of the exposed and menacing penis in the work derives from David Smith's antiwar series The Medals for Dishonor (1939 to 1945) and other antiwar art he produced in the forties. Like Smith, Westermann rec- ognized that masculinity without the constraints of civ- ilization expressed itself through physical violence. The weathered face of the work clearly resembles that of the figure in the painting Actor's Mask (1924, Museum of Modern Art) by Paul Klee, one of Westermann's favorite painters. It seems reasonable that he freely borrowed the motif to comment on his own perfor- mance in the Marine Corps and on the mask that sol- diers must wear while in service. I am confident that there are several more references that I have overlooked. This is not to criticize Rooks and Warren, whose entries in the catalogue raisonn6 of objects are uniformly excellent. Nobody can be expected to catch every debt and reference. In an essay on Brinkmanship, for example, I identified several sources for the work, but completely missed its obvious similarity to the Marine Corps insignia and to Honore Daumier's antiwar print "He sure looks fierce. I'll bet even the sparrows are afraid of him. "20 Westermann's range of interests was enormous, and the meaning of any one work is often open to multiple interpretations. Even though we are relatively close in time to the period of Westermann's production-he made sculp- ture from 1954 to 1981-our knowledge of his imme- diate world is not as comprehensive as it might be. He did not like discussing his work directly, he distrusted critics and historians, and on the few occasions he was asked by curators to write about specific pieces, he declined to do so. The communities that inspired his work, West Hollywood before World War II and the north side of Chicago just after it, are long gone. The literary references in his sculptures and prints run from Melville and the Bible to the printed ephemera he picked up on his travels. The films he enjoyed were equally diverse: Disney and B movies, the works of Stanley Kubrick, and science fiction. When so many topical references are deftly built into any given work, the task of explication will last quite some time. The complexity of Westermann's art should remind us of Baudelaire's famous definition of modernism as "the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the 46</page><page sequence="5">............. . .. . . .. . .. . . . ...... ...-. ...'..-. .... .... . ........... .,v o a H.

Westermann's debts to contemporary film, literature, comic books, sailors' art, folk and mass culture, as well as older forms of expression-so amply documented in both catalogues raisonnes-place him well within this modern sensibility. He drew on whatever sources he could find to comment on his historical moment, prob- ably recognizing that his audiences would at least find one of the many points of interpretive entry he pro- vided and therefore be able to begin reading his work. Westermann's work suggests a new map for mod- ernism, one that consists of radiating centers of pro- duction, such as Paris in the 1860s or Chicago in the 1950s, instead of the now largely debunked linear nar- rative of modernism. Measured this way, modernism can be understood as a set of overlapping nodal points, not a continuous flow. One advantage to this approach is that it allows us to forget the hierarchy of "great" artists responding to one another across and within generations. Instead, scholars must approach the past locally, recognizing that different centers-whether Paris, London, Berlin, New York, or Chicago-offered artists different kinds of inspiration, education, sup- port, critical feedback, and so on. In short, we need to look at communities in all their specificity and not worry about the so-called flow of history. If this makes it harder to write about the past, so be it. Historians are supposed to remember that the past is complex, and that history itself is an open and ongoing argument about the past. Though I seem to have drifted from my principal topic-the specific difficulties of writing about H. C. Westermann-it is only to suggest that all writing about artists necessarily takes us into broader areas of inquiry. The merit of the recent attention given to Westermann is that it fully licenses such exploration. Without these publications and exhibitions we would know considerably less about one of America's most colorful and complicated artists. With them we have a very solid foundation for further work, not only on Westermann, but also on American culture of the post- war decades. tv NOTES 1. Hereafter the catalogues, H. C.

In contrast with the beautiful, the sublime is that which overwhelms us physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Burke identified the experience with natural phenomena such as earth- quakes, tidal waves, and vast mountain ranges. More recently, sev- eral American scholars have suggested that the phenomena of mod- ern technology, for example the atom bomb, have joined with the natural sublime. For instance, see David E. Nye, American Technologi- cal Sublime (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1994). 11. The identification with mythic characters in American literature is a central part of Westermann's performance, evident in his letters, drawings, prints, and sculpture. The critic Peter Schjeldahl made the specific references to Popeye and Ishmael in an obituary published in late 1981; see The Hydrogen Jukebox, p. 101. 12. HCW, pp. 16-33. This point was more evident and more fully argued in his public lecture, "A Country Gone Nuts: Westermann's America," on 30 June 2001, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. The grotesque in modern art is often identified with the body depicted in states of decay, distress, or death, while in style, the grotesque is marked by exaggeration, hyperbole, and excessiveness. Artists who fall into this category include Goya, Grosz, and Peter Saul.
