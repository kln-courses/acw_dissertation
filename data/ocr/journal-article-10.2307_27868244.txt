Richmond: Curzon, 2001, xii + 351 pp. ISBN 0.7007.1240.2. Price: GBP 70.00 (hardback). G.L. K?STER If it is already a rare thing for comparative literature to move outside the narrow confines of Western literatures, Braginsky's book is nothing short of unique. He sets out to develop and trace a macro-dimensional model of the Asian variant of reflective-traditionalist (occasionally also called 'medieval' by the author) literature. It does so by establishing ideal conceptions of reflec tive-traditionalist literature as formulated by poetic treatises of its various key literatures. It also strives to establish a meta-language for typological compari son, avoiding the pitfalls of Western-centrism that usually beset comparative studies. In endeavouring to do so Braginsky leaves the Western Middle Ages, as well as much modern Western theory, out of consideration. In this way he hopes to make visible the systemic unity, specific rules and practices of the Asian literatures of the epoch of reflective traditionalism (pp. 7-9, 196). In the introductory chapter, Braginsky declares his allegiance to the orderly structuralism of Lotman and the controlled hermeneutics of Ricoeur to be more congenial than other literary theories to his materials, and opts for the Russian Historico-Typological School of Comparative Literature for the basic contours of the 'reflective-traditionalist type' and some of his methods of analysis. Considering religion, rather than politics or sociology, as con stitutive of reflective traditionalism, he prefers to follow Coomaraswamy Florensky and others with 'a good ear for the music of religious topics', and makes it his main task to view reflective-traditionalist literature 'in its rela tion to the theological - that is reflective-religious "picture of the world" inherent in the epoch in question', while eschewing the 'more and more politicized and sociologized approaches found in contemporary literary scholarship' (pp. 11-5). In Chapter 2, 'Literary aggregations', Braginsky describes the Asian cultures in their reflective-traditionalist phase as consisting of three 'zonal aggregations': one Arabo-Muslim; a second Indo-Southeast Asian; and a</page><page sequence="2">374 Book reviews third Sino-Far Eastern. At the centre of each he locates a 'zone-shaping litera ture' (Arab, Sanskrit, Chinese) around each of which are clustered a number of 'integrated literatures', drawing on them for much of their religious canon (Turkish, Tamil, and Japanese literatures, for instance). In China the reflec tive-traditionalist 'zone-shaping' tradition formed between the second and sixth centuries AD, in India between the third and seventh centuries, and in the Arab Muslim world between the seventh century and the ninth or tenth. Each 'zone-shaping tradition' developed its own religious canon, its sci ences of hermeneutics elucidating the correct way of interpreting and main taining the canon, and its growing body of fine literature, identifying with and emanating from (the central concepts of) the religious canon (Muhammad Logos; Brahman; Dao). Within each zonal aggregate may be seen the process of latching the 'integrated cultures' onto the 'zone-shaping' cultures. Braginsky then moves on to an examination of the ties between the zonal aggregations, concluding that 'there existed a certain form of an all-Asian literary proc ess'. Finally, in 'Illustration 1', he shows how the history of the literatures of Southeast Asia illustrates in miniature the workings of this process. Tracing the connection of literature with each culture's central domain - its concepts of the Absolute and its canon - in Chapter 3, 'Self-awareness of zone shaping literatures', Braginsky presents a comparative analysis of what 'aver age', 'mainstream' treatises on the poetics of the three zone-shaping literatures say about how a work ought to be created, what its nature and structure should be, how it should affect the reader, and what its purpose should be. He singles out for comparison: for India, writings from the stage preceding the dhvani-rasa doctrine (fifth to ninth centuries) as well as that doctrine itself; for China, mainly the Confucianist poetics of Liu Xie (completed 501?) but also those of some other (also Taoist) authors; and for the Arabo-Muslim world the classical Arab poetics of the ninth to eleventh centuries, the science of elo quence as exemplified in the work of 'Abd al-Qahir Al-Jurjani in the eleventh century, philosophical theories of literature from the tenth century onwards, and Sufi thought about literature from the twelfth century onwards. Braginsky concludes that at their reflective-traditionalist stage the three traditional literary doctrines have quite similar ways of conceiving the proc ess of writing and reading literature. The receptive phase of creation - acquir ing the correct inspiration for writing - is seen as the upward movement of a beam of intuition to union with the Absolute through poetic meditation. Its agentive phase - the proper writing down of the literary work - is perceived as the descent of a beam of intellectualized emotion, which is objectified, via genre, style, and the mental and verbal structures of the work, into a mate rial replica of the ideal image in the form of a work of belles lettres, which is pervaded by the energy of the Absolute.</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 375 As for the perception (reading) of literature, he finds that the three tradi tions of literary scholarship agree in viewing its agentive phase as the ascen sion of the beam of intuition of the reader to identification with the text, and its receptive phase as the conveying to the reader of the energy of the Absolute. Literature thus instils correct behavioural patterns, and - fulfilling the ultimate goal of literature as a sui-generis mystical path - sometimes also conveys the mystical experience of being part of the noumenal unity of the Universe. From this model of literary creation and perception Braginsky derives as concepts for his meta-language such terms as meditation, memo rization, energeticism of literature, intellectualized emotion, and genre struc ture (p. 196). Braginsky admits that the Arab tradition does not seamlessly fit the pat tern of reflective-traditionalist monocentricity. Whereas Chinese and Indian reflective-traditionalist culture are 'continuous' in that all through that phase they are anchored in only one Absolute, Arab tradition is 'discontinuous'. Transplanted out of ancient oral Arab tribal culture, it only fully attains the reflective-traditionalist model after going through several centuries in which two Absolutes clash - Arab classical poetry, and the Holy Koran. It is Sufism, an Arabo-Muslim synthesis with Hellenistic philosophy and rhetoric and with Eastern Christian thought, that finally establishes the religious Absolute as the centre of the literary system, conceiving of literature as an instrument that aids the reader's progress along the spiritual, religio-mystical path. On the basis of the treatises discussed above, as well as myths and reli gious writings, Braginsky argues in the fourth chapter, 'The anthropomor phism of literary systems', that reflective-traditionalist literature is perceived as isomorphic to the Universe and man. This anthropomorphism turns literature into an effective instrument for 'moulding' the type of individual ideally required by a given culture. Seen from a diachronic perspective, tra ditional literatures constitute a system of texts which conveys a certain type of personality, as it is embodied by the culture's founding father (Confucius, Buddha, Muhammad). The functional spheres of the literary system are hierarchically arranged around its centre, the canon, in three concentric circles, the content of which diminishes in value with distance from the centre. Each functional sphere corresponds on the one hand to a particular plane in the hierarchy of the Universe, as a bodily-spiritual phenomenon, and on the other hand to a dis tinct level of the human psychosomatic constitution. The space in the first circle is occupied by writings drawing on, and intended to influence, intuition and the spiritual heart, as embodied in the religious canon and adjacent works; the second circle by writings concerned with rational perception, as embodied in learned treatises and philosophy; and the third circle by writings connected with sensory perception by the</page><page sequence="4">376 Book reviews soul, and belles lettres. Thus the literary system is based on the principles of unity, centredness, hierarchy and functionality. These prescribe the place to be occupied by a genre and work within it, and the specific features of each genre's poetics. In 'Illustration 2', a case-study of an anthropomorphic literary system, Braginsky gives a detailed model of the spheres and genres forming the system of classical Malay literature. As context he takes the notion of the Sufi Path, with its stages anthropomorphically seen as areas of the human mind. Like the Path, the spheres of the literary system represent a spiritual ascent in stages: from the sphere of beauty, by way of the sphere of benefit, to the sphere of spiritual perfection. Each sphere fulfils its own task, doing so through a number of genre-structures, including genre forms which may convey diverse contents. Traditional culture exists, for Braginsky, so long as tradition and innova tion - in other words, centripetality and centrifugality - are in balance. A pronounced prevalence of either of these two poles results in cultural decline, that is, in ossification or disintegration. In the final chapter, 'Epilogue: neo-tra ditionalism', he looks at attempts to revive traditional values in the literatures of Asia, and discerns different phases and manifestations of this impulse, as well as a variety of motives - from nationalism to philosophical quietism. Unlike the unreflecting residual traditionalism of early modern litera ture, Braginsky argues, neo-traditionalist writings examine the principles of traditional and modern literary forms individually, comprehending and transfiguring them through a modern consciousness and inventing them where they are lacking. In 'Illustration 3' Braginsky traces neo-traditional ism's manifestation in Indonesian and Malaysian literature, discussing the existentialist novel Ziarah by the Indonesian writer Iwan Simatupang and some Sufi-inspired poetry by the Malay poets Kemala and Baha Zain. At the heart of Braginsky's book is a certain nostalgia for reflective tradi tionality's - in a European context, medievality's - now 'discarded image', and not only in its Asian form. This nostalgia is evident in his statement that 'glancing back at the European experience [of detraditionalization since the Renaissance], we cannot but wonder how and to what extent traditionality ought to be overcome; what are the inevitable losses on the way, and what, if anything can compensate for them' (p. 274). Braginsky's nostalgia, and his single-minded determination, seem to be the sources of his work's strengths as well as its weaknesses. The book's strengths are especially manifest where Braginsky writes Asian literary history, in the second and fifth chapters. His grasp of that difficult and complex field is indeed impressive, and his analyses make use of effective concepts and methods. In the third and fourth chapters - on the synchronie dimension of reflective traditionality - there is also much to</page><page sequence="5">Book reviews 377 appreciate. Here he convincingly demonstrates the dominant role of religion in the poetics he has examined. Whether the poetics he has chosen to analyse really all represent the mainstream of reflective-traditionalist theorizing on literature in their day may, however, be questioned. A case in point is Liu Xie's Wen-hsin Tiao-lung. This treatise has been made much of, especially by Western Sinologists in love with its almost Aristotelian, but rather un-Chinese, completeness and systematic quality. It was produced by a low-ranking lay scholar attached to a Buddhist temple, who was totally out of tune with the literary practices of his time, which were determined by the great aristocratic salons. The Wen hsin Tiao-lung, which is known often to project a picture of order and system more to satisfy the demands of its own inner rhetoric than as an accurate description of actual practice, gained some influence in traditional Chinese literary thinking only at a very late period (Owen 1992:183-6). Braginsky's decision to construct his model of what constitutes the type of reflective-traditionalist literature only on the basis of prescriptive poetics, and leave the study of the literary works themselves out of consideration (pp. 12-3), is also problematic. In my view it is a risky enterprise, comparable to trying to determine how traffic flows work purely on the basis of manuals of traffic regulations. Or it may be likened to trying to construct a langue entirely from its 'ideal' formulations without taking into account its parole, that is the full range of its actual use. This may draw the reader into confusing ideol ogy with practice and taking the attitude that 'once poetics has spoken, the matter is settled'. True, Braginsky is not unaware of the possible divergence between theory and practice. He justifies his decision to study only the poetics of the literary traditions, and not the literary works themselves, with the argument that 'in the epoch of traditional literature with its normative poetics [...] theoretical works determined practice in a relatively complete way' (pp. 12-3). Here it may be objected that while in the West the medieval and renaissance hand books of rhetoric did indeed reflect writing practice fairly closely, traditional Chinese poetics were as a rule not interested in providing concrete guidance on how to write, but only in helping the reader to cultivate himself as a gen tleman. To develop his actual writing practice, the Chinese writer could only turn to the anthologies of the best texts and learn by imitating them. Anyway, as a result of Braginsky's decision to restrict himself to trea tises on poetics, rarely going to the texts themselves, his 'invariant of the type of the reflective-traditionalist' in culture and literature does not to my mind have the character of a model constructed to help account for a living, observed reality. Instead it remains an unwieldy, unmoving mandala created by Braginsky on the basis of 'ideal systems': impressive, it is true, and very reflective-traditionalist (not to mention 'medieval'), but probably not the</page><page sequence="6">378 Book reviews window on the actual rules and practices of traditional literatures which Braginsky claims it is. Another problem is that although Braginsky defines tradition as a bal ance between the centripetal and the centrifugal (p. 277), in his discussion of the values instilled by literature he only attends to the centripetal. And had he more often descended to ground zero - the literary texts themselves, and what they have to teach about their actual poetics - he might have doubted that the traditions he examines were quite as monocentric in practice as the treatises on poetics make them out to be. He might then have noticed that in Chinese literature at precisely the period when the reflective-traditional ist phase began, there were also powerful anti-Confucian countercurrents. Associated with mysticism, drugs, and eccentricity, these centrifugal forces - driven by Buddhism and Taoism - inspired a wave of 'poetry of retreat', the theme of which was getting away from the dirt of the world and away from assisting the ruler in his mission of spreading virtue. Furthermore, although in Malay traditional culture and literature Islam conquered the religious centre, toppling the earlier Hindu canon, that did not mean the immediate or total disappearance of pre-Islamic ideologies and practices: elements of Hinduism, as well as of oral archaic culture, lingered on. Braginsky is of course well aware of this when he discusses the Hindu Islamic synthesis in Malay literature, which is his own field. In discussing the literary self-awareness of the Malays, however, by overemphasizing the Islamic elements in Malay manuscript culture, and by neglecting pre-Islamic and oral elements, he gives the misleading impression that what he presents is 'the' system of Malay literature in its totality. The greater part of those traditional Asian literatures whose reflective traditionalist character Braginsky tries to establish actually consist of 'court' literature. Of course even rulers needed the religious centre, to legitimate their power by invoking its higher values. But the courtly milieu was also one of the major focal points where countercurrents rallied to oppose reli gious seriousness, and toward the end of the reflective-traditionalist period the same can be said of the urban milieu. The countercurrents present in courts and cities put a premium on playfulness and increasingly tested, overstepped, and shifted the boundaries of propriety, bringing about a grad ual emancipation of the signifier from its subservience to a transcendental or immanent signified. Braginsky tends to view reflective-traditionalist literature's didactic func tion only as that of creating in the reader's personality a replica of his cul ture's religious founding fathers (p. 276). This tendency is overly reductive. How can it fully explain, for instance, the eleventh- and twelfth-century Ghaznavid court poetry of Iran, in which the ruler is praised not only for his Islamic virtues, but also for a heroism worthy of the great heroes of the pre</page><page sequence="7">Book reviews 379 Islamic past, and as an untiring participant in feasting and drinking bouts (De Bruyn, Idema and Van Oostrom 1986:149-66)? Another problem is that, while one can only agree with the centrality of religion as argued in Braginsky's model, the notion of the creation and reception of literature as an ascent by meditation towards (and consequent descent of) the Absolute is just as central to Western medieval literature as it is to its 'Eastern' reflective-traditionalist counterpart. In the West, where those in power were just as much bent on grounding their particular values in an unassailable Archimedic point beyond the reach of competitors, we find the same conception of literature reflected in the idea that writing and read ing were properly acts of commemoration - an assumption that was of vital importance to medieval hermeneutics as an ars rede legendi (art of reading correctly) stabilizing tradition (Vance 1979). Braginsky's neglect of Western comparisons is understandable in view of the vastness of the Asian field of research. But it brings with it the risk of establishing an 'Oriental' literary ghetto. Intentionally or not, it may also lead to the perpetuation of an 'Occidentalist' vision: that of a pure, 'spiritual East'. In point of fact, Braginsky's 'Eastern' treatises on poetics frequently invite comparison with Western literary theories, both traditional and modern. Arab and Sufi thinking (pp. 161-71) concerning lafz, ma'na and the centrality of the religious Absolute link up directly with the tradition of Western semi otic thought that leads from Augustine via Rousseau to the deconstruction of Derrida (Gellrich 1985:29-50; Norris 1987:30-96; Vance 1979:374). And 'Abd al Qahir al-Jurjani (p. 163) discusses notions quite close to what Lotman has called the 'semantization of form' (Fokkema and Kunne-Ibsch 1977:41). Hoping to abstract an unadulterated and 'correct' meta-language for describing his purely Asian model, free of foreign interferences, Braginsky seems to suggest that like the reflective-traditionalist Asian reader, the mod ern researcher too should obey the culture's ars rede legendi and avoid the West's ideology-critical modes of reading. Thus he talks about the need to 'eliminate the interference from contemporary mentality', reminding the researcher in almost Rankian language that 'each variant is inherent in a specific epoch' (pp. 8-10). It is true, of course, that Braginsky also shows a Bakhtinian stance where he writes that in their 'attempt to comprehend the "cues" of the dialogue, [researchers] must avoid silencing other "voices" but engage in colloquy with the "strange word" which means something different at every period of time and at every point in space' (p. 10). Here, however, it may be wondered whether the elimination of contemporary Western readings is not precisely that silencing of voices that he says should be avoided. Whatever the case may be, the language in which Braginsky speaks of</page><page sequence="8">380 Book reviews his Asian literatures is far from a meta-language, an objective speaking from outside one's own cultural practice. However useful and apposite they may be, the terms he mentions as examples - meditation, memorization, energeti cism, genre structure - remain Western terms, and spring from the research er's inevitable need to find a set of common denominators in a plethora of Chinese, Arab and Sanskrit metaphors. Western voices, too, are sounding where Braginsky speaks of the genres and forms of 'classical' (a Western and non-Malay notion) Malay literature. There the language of long-dead Dutch and British colonial scholar-administrators is still loudly and exclusively audible, whereas more recent research is unfortunately not granted a voice. In spite of its overly one-sided and 'idealist' approach, Braginsky's book deserves praise for its daring and its originality. It makes very worthwhile and thought-provoking reading for all those who are interested in the his tory of Asian mentalities, and in the comparative poetics and literary history of Asia. It thoroughly demonstrates its main point: the vital importance - so often unjustly neglected - of religion for our understanding of reflective-tra ditionalist as well as neo-traditionalist writings. It is a demanding book, to be sure, but once the reader has gone some way into it, he or she will find that it leads into a veritable treasure-trove of new ideas, fresh questions, and challenging areas of research.
