<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRISTOPHER BUSH Deaths of a Discipline Criticism must be transcendental, that is, it must consider literature ephemeral and easily entertain the supposition of its entire disappearance. -Ralph Waldo Emerson,journal of 18 May, 1840 (qtd. in Hartman 5) How might one imagine the death of Comparative Literature? Face calm, resem- bling its own death mask, silent after a long life and natural passing? Thrusting a dagger into its own breast as it falls on a beloved it believes already dead? Will it, having gotten off the boat and gone native, rasp into darkness, "The horror! The horror!"? Do we see a shadow climb stairs, walk the length of a corridor, open a door and enter a room, where it encounters Comparative Literature, who looks briefly into the camera, wide-eyed, exclaiming "You!"-just before the shots? Or do the shots come like four blows on the door of misfortune, ringing out on some foreign beach? If there is something absurd about such scenes (which could be multiplied end- lessly), it is because they recall the resolutely disembodied ways in which we ordinar- ily discuss the lives and deaths of disciplines-their demise attributed to internal methodological exhaustion or to the corrosive effects of broader cultural forces, like television or deans. In what follows I would like to take seriously the "death" of Comparative Literature, not by literalizing it, but by considering how it might be figured. The high theory that defined the generation of Comparative Literature putatively dead or dying today was in many ways a sustained critique of organic metaphors, whether used to describe the unity of works, the history of peoples, or, above all, the origins and operations of languages. The often morbid rhetoric of this theory, a rhetoric of violence and bodily fragmentation, defacement, and disfigura- tion, of tombs and crypts, is symptomatic of this assault on Nature, the Human, and any expression of their harmonious unity. If that Comparative Literature in some sense called for an end to the anthropocentric pathos of one kind of death, its own passing has churned up ghosts and specters in its wake. That is, the figures of life and death have been not so much abandoned as displaced: mobilized, ironized, perhaps cut and pasted. It is fair to say that Spivak's work rarely, if ever, acquires a gothic pallor. So why "death" of a discipline? The title's provocation is neither a lament nor a call to arms, but the naming of a structure. That is, "death" here signals not Comparative Literature's factual termination, its ceasing to be, but the possibility of the impos- sibility of being-there that has always-yes, always already-structured its existence. As my formulation indicates, I propose reading this "death" in Heideggerian terms, according to which death is an absolute certainty and yet any experience of it is impossible. For Heidegger, death proper is always one's own death. It therefore</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 208 precludes not only understanding, but also any imagination, anticipation, or pre- diction, because it is by definition the utter annihilation of the being-there that is their absolute ontological ground.' One can imagine one's corpse, one can witness the dying of others or the dead, but one cannot know or imagine being dead, itself an oxymoronic formulation. To translate: how could we, to the extent that we are it, speak of the death of Comparative Literature? A title isjust a title and death is not explicitly thematized in Spivak's text. In this case, however, the structure is more important than the theme. The relationship to death I have described appears in Spivak's text as the future, specifically what she describes as the undecidable but decisive future that will have been. One might expect a text entitled Death of a Discipline to be elegiac or at least anxious, and yet it speaks largely of what Comparative Literature will do, will be, or rather might do and be, more precisely, might have done or been (in a future anterior sense). It is not a text about something that has come or is coming to an end; it is a text about something to come, or rather the to-come. The death of Comparative Literature is its future, but a future, as she repeatedly emphasizes, "without guarantees." Spivak writes at the beginning of her second chapter: "if in the last chapter I exhorted you to think of the ungraspable other as the figured origin of our defini- tions, today I emphasize the unimaginable future 'to come"' (32). The problems of origin and future are both similar and related. While the former is "ungrasp- able," the latter is "unimaginable." While the "other" is effectively a figure whose defiguration is the problem of "ethical semiosis" that defines Spivak's conception of reading-"to learn to read is to learn to dis-figure the undecidable figure into a responsible literality, again and again" (72)-the future is not even a figure or image; we cannot begin to read it. Or rather, we can try to read it not as predic- tion but in prefigurations. We cannot imagine what the future will be, but we can imagine, if without guarantees, what the future will have been. The figures become true only later, after the future. And if both origin and future are similar in being unknowable as such, each paradoxically folded into and unfolding from the pres- ent, they are also, for Comparative Literature, linked in a more pragmatic and historically localized sense, for surely the discipline's future is inseparable from its readings-that-will-have-been of the other. Following Spivak's call for reading and writing as "robust allegories of knowing and doing" (42), how might we read figures of death as prefigurations of a discipline to come? Death of a Moth One's sympathies, of course, were all on the side of life. -Virginia Woolf, "The Death of the Moth" The action of Virginia Woolf's "The Death of the Moth" is easily summarized: a narrator, apparently seated at a desk (she has a pencil handy), observes, inter- 1 For the canonical formulation of this relationship to death, see Sein und Zeit, ?46-?53. The only explicit naming of Heidegger in Death ofa Discipline is a passing reference in Spivak's distinction of the Aristotelian general from the Latin universal (a fairly Heideggerian move), but the index of her roughly contemporaneous Critique ofPostcolonialReason lists eleven separate references, and her writing on Hei- degger dates back to her translator's introduction to Of Grammatology.</page><page sequence="3">DEATHS OF A DISCIPLINE / 209 mittently, on a September morning, the fitful flight and then death, in a nearby windowpane, of a moth. I would like to focus on two moments in the text. First, the moment of the moth's death: "The insignificant little creature now knew death" (11). The formulation is not quite right: the moth now knows nothing. It is the narrator who now knows death, or rather who has found an intimation of mortal- ity in the death of another being. But in another sense the formulation is precise, for "now knew death"juxtaposes the immediate present of the "now" with the past tense of "to know." The tense of the statement is effectively present perfect (now has known death), a kind of folding into the present of death's future anterior temporal- ity. Yetjust before this pronouncement, "the unmistakable tokens of death showed themselves" (11). This reminds us that not only is the moth's knowledge of death not truly knowledge, but that what the narrator knows are also only "the tokens," the signs and marks, of death, however "unmistakable" they might be. To the extent that death can be an object of knowledge, it is on these terms: never death as such, but only ever the death of the other, "known"--anticipated and remembered-in the signs of the death of another. The second moment in the text I would like to focus on is Woolf's description of the world behind the windowpane that circumscribes the life and death of the moth. The epiphanic significance of the moth's death is tied to its earlier identifica- tion with life ("He was little or nothing but life"): "The same energy which inspired the rooks, the ploughmen, the horses, and even, it seemed, the lean bare-backed downs, sent the moth fluttering" (9).2 Despite this almost pantheistic figuration of a generalized life-force, we see through the windowpane that this September morn- ing "The plough was already scoring the field opposite the window, and where the share had been, the earth was pressed flat and gleamed with moisture" (9). We see Nature not as timeless, self-regenerating substance, but a nature "already" scored by working hands, already marked by the tokens of death. As a prefiguration of Comparative Literature's future, Woolf's text is disappoint- ing. One of the things that makes the death-scenes with which I opened seem absurd is their reduction of Comparative Literature to a single anthropomorphic figure; the moth-isolated, biomorphic, biological-is only a slight improve- ment. Its death is an isolated, indoor spectacle for an individual consciousness, a spectacle in which "I" become "one" as easily as a moth becomes "the moth."'3 If we 2 Such a reading of this text should ultimately lead to the figure of "the planet" in Spivak's recent work, specifically as a kind of rewriting of Heidegger's distinction between world and earth, most famously articulated in "The Origin of the Work of Art," an essay cited several times in Critique of Postcolonial Rea- son. Here I will have to content myself with suggesting as a context for reading Woolf's landscape this passage from another 1999 Spivak lecture: "To think the other, as everyone knows, is one meaning of being human. To be human is to be intended toward the other. If to be human is also to be an occasional and discontinuous animator of what we call timing and spacing, like and unlike all living creatures, we provide for ourselves transcendental figurations of what we think is the origin of this animating gift of animation, if there is any: Mother, Nation, God, Nature. These are names of alterity, some more radical than others. Planet-thought opens up to embrace an inexhaustible taxonomy of such names including but not identical with animism as well as the spectral white mythology of post-rational science. If we imagine ourselves as planetary subjects rather than global agents, planetary creatures rather than global entities, alterity remains underived from us, it is not our dialectical negation, it contains us as much as it flings us away" (Imperatives 44-46). The reading suggested here brings an additional poignancy to the narrator's observation about the moth-"What he could do he did"-which becomes almost a kind of politics. 3 For a classic critique of the universalization of birth and death, see Roland Barthes's "The Great Family of Man" in Mythologies.</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 210 indeed take reading and writing as robust allegories of knowing and doing, Woolf's reading of the tokens of death implies a knowing that leaves the knower no doubt moved, but essentially unchanged. The energy shared by the moth, the rooks, the plowmen, the horses, even the fields, is not shared by the narrator and so neither is its extinction. Comparative Literature is of course plural, multigenerational, dispersed-not simply as a matter of fact, but essentially so (see Saussy and Apter). It must therefore be thought in terms of collective memories, collective anxieties, collective anticipa- tions and losses. Spivak's text is among other things a meditation on the problem of collectivities and pluralities, of the philosophical, ethical, and pragmatic limits of the sometimes innocuous-seeming "we." Indeed, it is the shifting understand- ings of collectivities, of singularities, of singular collectivies, and so on, that have renewed-not to say brought back to life-the question of Comparative Literature's death. Yet the turn from the singularity of one's own death to the collective should not be understood as a multiplication of the singular into the plural; it could not be addressed, for example, by figuring the deaths of many moths. To acknowledge the life and death and future of the discipline as always already plural is to acknowledge that it is an interpretive community constitutive of and constituted by the reading and writing of tokens and marks. Vampire des signes Son siecle epouvante de n 'avoirpas connu Que la mort triomphait dans cette voix &amp;trange ! -Stephane Mallarme, "Le Tombeau d'Edgar Poe" Victor Segalen's prose poem "Vampire" (1911) is a text whose figuration of the relationship between life and death is considerably more involved than Woolf's, in a number of senses:4 Friend, friend, I have laid your body in a coffin of lovely red lacquer which cost me much silver; I have conducted your soul, by its familiar name, onto this very tablet here on which I lavish care; But more than this I must not do for you: "To treat the living as dead, what a lack of humanity! To treat the dead as living, what a want of discretion! What a risk of forming an equivocal being!" Friend, friend, despite these maxims, I cannot forsake you. I will therefore fashion an equivocal being: neither genie, nor dead, nor living. Hear me: If it pleases you yet to suck on life, with its sweet taste and pungent spices; If it pleases you to bat your eyelids, draw breath into your chest and shiver beneath your skin, hear me: Become my Vampire, friend, and night after night, without disturbance or haste, gorge yourself on the hot liquor of my heart.5 I am here contrasting not authors and their politics but figures and their possible readings. I find the politics of both Woolf and Segalen inspiring and limited. 5 I here transpose the Chinese into left-right, horizontal format. For a book-length study of Segalen in English, see Forsdick. For a more complete commentary on this poem and a recent introduction to the collection in which it appears, Steles, see Victor Segalen, Steles, Timothy Billings and Christopher Bush, translators and editors, forthcoming from Wesleyan University Press.</page><page sequence="5">DEATHS OF A DISCIPLINE / 211 The poem is an allegory of its own production. It takes as its raw material notjust the vampire topos but also the Confucian vocabulary of the Liji (The Book of Rites), which contributes directly, if in slightly abbreviated form, the Chinese atop the page and, indirectly, the "maxim" cited within the poem. (In the original Chinese both lines are followed by the phrase ifTJA, -tt2 ["that is not to be done"].) Segalen's manuscript contains a fairly literal translation of the passage from Confucius, which I translate here: "To treat a dead person as being entirely dead, this lacks humanity! To treat a dead person as entirely alive, this is ignorance!" (qtd. in Doumet 138). The "citation" that appears in the poem itself is far from a simple translation then. While the original Chinese contrasts two possible relations to the dead-treating them as too much dead or too much alive-Segalen's deliberate mistranslation in the body of the poem raises the question of how the living are to be treated. The poem itself correspondingly raises and ultimately embodies the danger of creating "an equivocal being." This being is at once the lost friend (returned as vampire), the speaker (those bitten by vampires become vampires themselves), and not least the poem itself. Because the discourses of Orientalism and translation theory are both so permeated by the distinction between the living spirit and the dead letter, a distinction that accounts for much of their common intellectual history, the poem figures a vampirization of these broader discourses. Despite the implicit maxims, Segalen's text creates an equivocal being by not only translating lines from the Li ji into French, but also translating a French topos into the language of Confucian ritual, leaving both transformed.6 The "ungraspable other" of the Chinese letter -affiliated with death both thematically and discursively-is differed, by being translated into French, but also deferred to, not least because it makes Segalen's poem essentially bilingual, that is, neither French nor Chinese but constituted by their interplay. It would be hard to imagine a more precise allegory of what Spivak describes as "the irreducible work of translation, not from language to language but from body to ethical semiosis, that incessant shuttle that is a 'life"' (12). Poems that commemorate or are about commemorating the dead are at least as old as writing itself, and it is no wonder that urns, tombs, and crypts have so often provided the thematic material for poems about poetry or for other forms of figural mis-en-abime. The particular value of Segalen's text-in terms of both its poetic effect and its power as a figuration of reading, writing, and translation-is produced by the encounter of this thanatographic tradition with cultural difference-not merely cultural difference as a theme, but on the level of inscription. Segalen's "Vampire" offers one figural resource for reading life and death not as this world and what comes after, but as cultural practices bound to one another and to which we are bound. 6 While the contemporaneous Poundian tradition of Sinophilia inverts the trope of the dead Oriental letter by figuring the ideograph as the presentation and preservation of life, Segalen's text confounds this basic distinction. (Pound found this poetics to be prefigured in Ernest Fenollosa's The Chinese Written Character as a Mediumfor Poetry, which still offers its most vivid presentation). The equivocal nature of the quasi- or pseudo-translations of Stkles as a whole is frequently figured in terms of a relationship to the dead, most obviously in the stele form itself (bei). Segalen's preface gives an account of the significance of this form, which, according to him, preserves a series of past functions and meanings: placed on either end of a coffin, and with a windlass drilled through them to support a rope, the boards were inscribed with praise for the deceased. Bet were previously stone pots which, according to the Book of Rites, were the first station in a sacrificial ceremony. They were also a kind of sundial, and so on.</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 212 If "Vampire" figures a kind of Comparative Literature in which "the ungraspable other" functions as its "figured origin," it might also be read as a prefiguration of an unimaginable future to come.' Segalen's text presents a series of tenses and moods: past (what the speaker did to prepare the funeral), present (the speaker at the moment of enunciation: "this very tablet here"), the gnomic present of the cita- tion from the Liji, a vow to do something in the future tense ('"je formerai"), and lastly the non-constative results of this speech act: conditional subjunctives framed by imperatives. The creation of the equivocal being is to come, the transformation of the speaker to come later still, conditionally.8 Burial Practices In her translator's introduction to Of Grammatology, Spivak cites Nietzsche's "On Truth and Lie in the Extra-moral Sense": "The living is merely a type of what is dead, and a very rare type" (xxix). Thirty years later when, in Death of a Discipline, Spivak writes of "the irreducible work of translation, not from language to language but from body to ethical semiosis, that incessant shuttle that is a 'life,"' the scare quotes reflect a distance from biologism, but more generally signal a deconstructed rela- tionship between "life" and "death" not as biological events but as the inscriptional foundations of human experience. Taking seriously the figure of Comparative Literature's "death" entails recognizing this death not as a mortal demise to be has- tened or avoided, but as a fact of life, so to speak, that has always been its enabling condition of possibility. Since Derrida's citation, as one of the epigraphs to Speech and Phenomenon, of the enunciation "I am dead" from a Poe story, deconstructive criticism has found in thanatic marks and statements allegories of the essential character of signs in general: all marks are memorial, and so explicit memorializa- tion is simply a writing-large of this fact. In practical terms, then, the issue of Comparative Literature's death is not to be diagnosed medically. The problem is rather how we collectively develop practices that in some way negotiate the possibility of our own impossibility. Indeed, one of the things that makes a group a group is how it symbolically accommodates the mortality of its members and of itself as group. But it must be emphasized that to say that all signs are memorial is also to say that they are as tied to the future as to the past. Spivak's hostility to "world lit. in translation" (73) might be understood in this light: anthologies produce the literature of the future (anterior) as much as they preserve the literature of the past. Spivak does not resist, for example, mak- ing a given writer available to Anglophones (she is an important translator into English herself, after all), nor necessarily the particular canons and groupings that might emerge; rather, she resists the monolingual medium, the price already silently paid by committing to reading from left to right and top to bottom, for 7 In another context, on another subject: "this is [. . .] not even 'learning about other cultures.' This is imagining yourself, really letting yourself be imagined (experience that impossibility) without guaran- tees, by and in another culture, perhaps. Telepoiesis. Literature is what escapes the system; you cannot speed read it. The figure 'is' irreducible" (Spivak Death 52). 8 This has proven to be historically true of the reception of Steles. English editions of the text have refused to take the Chinese part of the text seriously, in some cases leaving it out altogether.</page><page sequence="7">DEATHS OF A DISCIPLINE / 213 example-burying, however respectfully, rather than cremating or exposing. It is one thing to open one's cemeteries to others, quite another to know that one will leave one's own mark, if at all, in a place where it might be or become illegible, or worse. It is one thing to devote one's life to the other, quite another to surrender one's death. Would that not be the ultimate act of "ethical semiosis"? From understanding marks as essentially memorial it follows that the kinds of readings I have proposed are not exactly allegorical. Their figures of death and its tokens are not extended metaphors but extended synecdoches, figuring the essentially memorial nature of marks in a way that brings ground and figure so close together that they produce a kind of semiotic feedback, a mis-en-abime. If "Vampire" figures language approaching the condition of monument, we find something like its complement in Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Here memorial approaches the condition of text, not simply because it abandons plastic representation for the sake of proper names, but because the ground of the monu- ment-the background against which its figures assert their legibility-is itself a minimal mark in the earth, a scoring that seems to emerge from the earth as much as mark the trace of something returned to it. It calls on visitors not only to read but to experience reading spatially, to enter into it, to put a piece of paper against its mirroring surface and with the imprecise rubbings of a pencil reproduce an inscrip- tion, a souvenir, each a perfect cliche, each absolutely singular. This is another possible prefiguration of Comparative Literature. Princeton University Works Cited Apter, Emily. "Global translatio: The 'Invention' of Comparative Literature, Istanbul, 1933."
