<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sarah A. Queen, From Chronicle to Canon: the Hermeneutics of the Spring and Autumn, According to Tung Chung-shu, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1996, xiv-287 pp., 12 plates in the text. A witness of the political, economic and social transformations that brought the empire to its zenith under the reign of Emperor Wu, Dong Zhongshu (c. 195-105 B.C.) was one of the most representative figures of the religious and cultural syncretism that characterized the unification of rival states with different ethnic identities under the banner of a single emerging dynasty ? that of the Han. After leaving his native land in 152 B.C. he moved to Changan, the capital, to serve at the court of Emperor Jing (r. 156-141 B.C.). Here, however, his image of Confucian man of letters was obscured by a group of Taoists who enjoyed the favours of the court and above all of Empress Dou (wife of Emperor Wen and mother of Emperor Jing). In this rather uncongenial atmosphere, Dong Zhongshu began his career of erudite with the study of the Gongyang Commentary of the Chunqiu {Springs and Autumns). Although overshadowed by the Taoists of the Huang Lao lineage, who were adepts of techniques and doctrines based on texts attributed to the Yellow Emperor and to Laozi, he managed to profit from his contact with them, borrowing concepts and interpretations that were only apparently incompatible with Confucianism. This policy allowed him to develop a comprehensive philosophic system that found its expression in the main work attributed to him, the Chunqiu fanlu (Luxuriant Gems of the Springs and Autumns), and at the same time to enjoy the favour of the court while waiting for better times to come. When he ascended the throne, Emperor Wu (r. 140-134 B.C.) dissociated himself from the policy of Empress Dou, encouraging those men of letters who intended to introduce reforms based on the teachings of Confucius. The young emperor issued an edict promoting those 'literati who were deserving and good, sincere and upright, honest and critical', in other words, the Confucians, while dismissing all those who had deviated from the teachings of Confucius. This marked the beginning of the decline, although not the disappearance, of the Taoists at court. On the other hand, at the same time as the decline of the Taoists and the rise of the Confucians, the prestige of another group of literati known as fangshi (masters of the techniques), also increased. This group did not identify with any school of thought in particular but inherited the doctrines and teachings of several schools. This is the complex and variegated cultural background behind the intellectual activity of Dong Zhongshu of which S. Queen presents for the first time a complete and comprehensive picture, analysing his work, in particular the Chunqiu fanlu, and the impact of his thinking on the culture and politics of the time. Above all, the author of the book endeavours to overcome the difficult problem of the attribution and dating of the Chunqiu fanlu (the most important critical edition is that of Su Yu, Chunqiu fanlu yizheng, with a preface by Wang Xianqian dated 1914). Although refuting the theory that the Chunqiu fanlu derived from the Dong Zhongshu and from the Gongyang Dong Zhongshu zhiyu already proposed in the 16th century by Hu Yingling and taken up again by Yao Jiheng during the Qing dynasty, and although pointing out the absolute absence of any formal similarities between these works, S. Queen nevertheless acknowledges their compatibility, that is, the important conceptual analogies 203</page><page sequence="2">between them, and thus their probable common origin. This hypothesis clashes with the position of Huang Yunmei, who in the Qing era, claimed that the Chunqiu fanlu was a spurious text. The publication of the Siku quanshu (Complete Collection of the Four Treasuries) was a decisive moment in the history of the debate between the supporters of the work's authenticity and their opponents. The publishers asserted that the Chunqiu fanlu, although incorporating material from the Han dynasty, was not to be ascribed in toto to Dong Zhongshu. This thesis was further developed by Su Yu, who considered the problem of the authenticity of each single chapter and put forward the hypothesis that writings by Dong Zhongshu from different periods and other works of dubious origin had flowed into the Chunqiu fanlu. Dong Zhongshu fell into oblivion during the eastern Han dynasty and only with the Sui and Tang dynasties was the work entitled Chunqiu fanlu again mentioned and attributed to him. Despite the numerous errors and the inclusion of several apocryphal chapters, such as chapter 23 (Sandai gaizhi zhi wen, 'The Changing Regulations of the Three Dynasties, from Simplicity to Refinement'), already indicated as such by G. Arbuckle (1995), chapter 25 (Yao Shun bu shan yi, Tang Wu bu zhuan sha, 'Yao and Shun did not Unauthorizedly Abdicate the Throne, Tang and Wu did not Seize the Throne by Regicide') and chapter 77 (Xun tian shi dao, 'Conform to Heaven's Way'), Su Yu pointed out the coherence of the concepts expressed in the text, defending its authenticity on the basis of a comparison with several passages attributed to the author and conserved in Han texts (Ship, Hanshu, Shuoyuan, Yantielun, Shuowen jiezi, Lunheng, Zhouli zhengshizhu) and subsequent eras (commentary of Liu Zhao to Hou Hanshu, Yiwen leiju, Guwenyuan). On the basis of these considerations, S. Queen, reappraising the post-Han quotations, succeeds in identifying a coherence of content in these and in the Han texts referring to our author. However, it emerges from her analysis that one of the traditional strongholds of Dong Zhongshu's thinking, the cosmology of the Five Phases, exhaustively illustrated in the Chunqiu fanlu (chaps. 38, 42, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64) found no support in the quotations attributed to the author. Therefore, as Keimatsu Mitsuo (1959) and Dai Junren (1968) had already pointed out, the chapters devoted to the Five Phases were probably written later and Dong Zhongshu's cosmology was informed only by the yin yang theories (pp. 102-4). In addition to the contents, which betray the multiple parenthood of the work, also the chapter titles are heterogeneous and suggest the existence of a number of different editors in the course of the centuries through which the work was handed down to us. S. Queen proposes a division of the work into five sections: 1. the exegetic writings on the principles of the annals Springs and Autumns (chaps. 1-37), the first six chapters of which she considers authentic and the others partly ascribable to his disciples; 2. the chapters already identified by Su Yu and then by Tanaka Masami (1986) as Huang Lao chapters, probably written when Dong Zhongshu was at the court of Emperor Jing (chaps. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 77, 78); 3. the yin yang chapters, which present the relationship between the king and the cosmos in terms of yin and yang opposition-complementarity dialectics (chaps. 41-57, 79-82); 4. the chapters referring to the Five Phases, probably apocryphal; 5. the chapters on the rituals, which analyse and develop the rituals described in Springs and Autumns (chaps. 65-76), of which chap. 74 was probably written at a later date. In the second part of the study, 'Exegesis and Canonization' (pp. 115-226), S. Queen examines the meaning and value of Springs and Autumns within the framework of Confucianism, which was raised to the level of court doctrine by Emperor Wu in 136 B.C. with the appointment of the erudites of the Five Classics (Shi, Shu, Li, Yi, Chunqiu). Of the five interpretative traditions that transmitted the teachings of the Springs and Autumns, Gongyang, Guliang, Zuo, Zou and Jia, the first three flourished in particular. First among these was the Gongyang, codified in the Gongyang Commentary, which represented a corpus of theories that came to the knowledge of Dong Zhongshu and his disciples. Conceived as a guide for warding off calamities and as a model of humanity and uprightness for the king, they emphasized the censorial, transforming and prophetic power of the Springs and Autumns in 204</page><page sequence="3">an attempt to use the sacred Confucian writings to redefine the criteria of political power and to reform the abuses committed by the preceding dynasty. In this work Dong Zhongshu criticizes the Qin dynasty: the law by itself is not enough to ensure that men develop those traits with which they are endowed from birth. The weakness of the Qin legal system lies in the fact of having considered only the sphere of human action, and thus ignoring the sense of intentionality. Observance of the law does not necessarily coincide with morality: someone acting against the law may be acting on moral grounds; on the other hand, someone acting in accordance with the law may be driven by immoral urges. Although not separating it from other Confucian writings, to each of which he ascribes a particular virtue and power ('[...] the Odes and the Documents order the intentions, the Rites and Music purify the goodness, the changes and the Springs and Autumns illuminate understanding'), Dong Zhongshu holds up the Springs and Autumns as a mirror of the political thought of Confucius: by analysing past events Confucius judged both human actions, expressing criticism or approval, and the moral significance of each event (censorial power); furthermore, he was able to predict future events (prophetic power) and adjust laws and the government (transformative power). In a negative evaluation of the laws imposed by the preceding political system and in an attempt to reassert the priority of moral education and rituals, Dong Zhongshu interpreted the relation between the former and the latter in terms of the dialectic contraposition of yin and yang, giving priority to yang, that is, moral principles and Confucian rituals. Like the Confucian literati who were his contemporaries he believed that the laws acted as a support for moral precepts and rituals. In an attempt to make amends for the abuses of the Qin dynasty, Dong Zhongshu invited Emperor Wu to reform the rites, using as his model the culture and institutions of the Zhou dynasty. The influence exerted by Dong Zhongshu and his disciples on imperial policy with reference to the issue of the rites was purely marginal. Despite the introduction of ceremonies suggested by the Confucians (the sacrifices feng and shan, the suburban sacrifices, and so on), the emperor drew his main inspiration from the teachings of the fangshi in implementing the ritual practices. He not only modified the aims of the Confucian rites, but introduced also new objects of worship, such as the Five Emperors (wudi), the Lord of the Earth (houtu) and the Grand Unifier (taiyi). At the court of Emperor Wu, the Springs and Autumns, rather than as source of inspiration for reforming the rituals, became a collection of ceremonial rules to be followed in settling legal disputes. The final chapter, 'Canon, Cosmos, and Court Patronage' (pp. 206-26), exarnines the most peculiar aspect of Dong Zhongshu's thinking, namely interactive cosmology, according to which human conduct can have an influence on the natural processes of the cosmos. In this interpretation he is close to one of the main issues of the Huang Lao boshu (Huang Lao Manuscripts), discovered in Mawangtui in 1973, and in particular to the Jingfa (Constant Norms) and Shiliu jing (Sixteen Constants), in which cosmological interpretations, meditation and politics were combined into a unitary vision of the world. Three aspects of Dong Zhongshu's thinking are innovative vis-?-vis the cosmology of these texts, from which in any case one may draw an exhortation to the king to follow the processes of nature in establishing social order: the priority he insistently gives to the yang tendencies of Heaven; the intentionality Heaven is acknowledged to have; the relationship between the ethical principles of the Confucian writings and the normative models of Heaven. In other words, the ruler must prevalently follow the transforming influence of virtue rather than passively receive the coercive power of the law. Furthermore, Heaven is provided with anthropomorphic attributes, an aspect that is absent from Huang Lao cosmology. Also the doctrine of wisdom and knowledge differs from Huang Lao epistemology. The chapters referring to yin and yang do not teach that the laws of the universe are perceptible only to those who cultivate their minds using the techniques of meditation. It is through the observation of the regularity of Heaven that one learns to discern the human correlations with the heavenly virtues and cosmic rules. Dong Zhongshu adapts the cosmology already expressed in the texts of Taoist tradition, making it less esoteric and 205</page><page sequence="4">subordinating the understanding of the law governing nature to the respect of the teachings enshrined in the Confucian classics. As he explained to Emperor Wu: T have studied the Springs and Autumns carefully and examined the events of past eras in order to observe the mutual relations between Heaven and mankind' (Ban Gu, Hanshu, Beijing 1975, chap. 56, p. 2498). In the annals, Confucius had listed the responsibilities of the states, relating them to the various calamities and corresponding anomalous events in order to show that man's actions pervade and penetrate heaven and earth, and that the past and future are mutually related. Not always does Heaven act in a regular and constant way and its irregularities have important political implications: calamities and natural disasters are warnings for the ruler. These theories, as well as in the Chunqiu fanlu, are comprehensively expressed also in chapter 27 of the Hanshu, Wuxingzhi (Treatise on the Five Phases) in which also the theories on portents of Liu Xiang (76-8 B.C.), Liu Xin (?-23 A.D.), Sui Meng, Xia Housheng and other literati are illustrated. Dong Zhongshu, who never considered the anomalies of nature could be attributed to the Five Phases, interpreted unlucky portents as the consequences or omens of man's transgressing behaviour, determined by the will of Heaven rather than by an anomalous working of the Five Phases. The book has six appendixes; 'The Birth and Death Dates of Tung Chung-shu' (pp. 241-48), 'The Dates of the Han-shu 56 Memorials' (pp. 249-54), 'Han Transmission of Kung-yang Learning' (p. 255), 'Han Dynasty Disciples of Tung Chung-shu' (pp. 256-58), 'Citations and Titles Attributed to Tung Chung-shu' (pp. 259-63) and 'Transmission of Ch'un-cWiu fan-lu Editions' (pp. 264-68). In the fourth appendix, among others, the author mentions Sui Hong, better known as Sui Meng, who was sentenced to death for having predicted the imminent end of the reign of Emperor Zhao (r. 86-74 B.C.) (Ban Gu, op. cit., chap. 75, pp. 3153 f.) and comments: 'Apparently the death sentence was never executed because five years later when his prediction came true and Emperor Xuan (r. 73-49 B.C.) ascended the throne, Sui was reappointed to the post of gentleman' (p. 257). According to the biography of Sui Hong, Emperor Zhao, on hearing of the prediction referring to the forthcoming end of his reign, sentenced him to death. Five years later, when Emperor Xuan ascended the throne, Sui Hong's prediction was reappraised and deemed to be correct. So, perhaps as a token of his gratitude, Ban Gu concludes: 'Meng zi wei lang', (Ban Gu, ibid.). In all probability, as would emerge from a different interpretation of 'Meng zi wei lang', it was the son of (Sui) Meng and not Master Meng (in which case Ban Gu would perhaps have preferred the expression 'Suizi', Master Sui) who was nominated 'gentleman' (lang), as Sui Meng had in fact been executed, as we read also in Ban Gu, op. cit., chap. 88, p. 3616. In conclusion, this book by S. Queen not only provides us with a new key of interpretation and an exhaustive presentation of the life and work of Dong Zhongshu, the most representative of the literati and philosophers of the Han empire, but also invites us to reappraise his contribution to the culture and political life of the time.
