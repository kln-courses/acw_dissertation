<plain_text><page sequence="1">FEATURE REVIEW Problems and Perspectives in Religions Discourse: Advaita Vedanta Implications. By John Grimes. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994. Pp. x + 209. Faculty of Religious Studies at McGill University Do you mean to say that you are proposing that it is more logically consistent to speak of the unqualified Absolute than of the theistic deity? -Professor K. Satchidananda Murty (to the author, p. x) This is indeed what the author proposes in the book under review. In fact this is one of the two claims about the book that are stated with quotable precision in the Introduction by the author. He writes: "this work is in- tended to state two radically new assertions in regards to theories of re- ligious discourse" (p. 6). He then states the first assertion as follows: 1. Religious discourse can be interpreted to be not only cognitive, but also valid. This in itself is not a unique claim, but it becomes so when Advaita adds to it that since the referent of religious discourse is immediately present as the constitutive being of everything whatsoever, and therefore self-evident and certain, it is fundamental and prior to all proofs which must necessarily pre- suppose it. Yet it does not presuppose itself as it is the one indubitable fact of experience, which can never be denied without self-contradiction. Advaita's vision claims that for the qualified aspirant, religious discourse directly and cognitively asserts the Reality and that for the non-qualified aspirant, religious discourse indirectly, or, in specific cases, directly asserts the Absolute. And.... Then the second assertion, which echoes the epigraph to this review, is made as follows: 2. Contrary to common belief, it is more philosophically and logically con- sistent to speak of the unqualified Absolute than of a theistic deity. The general idea is that an anthropomorphic God is comprehensible but inappropriate as an object of worship and that a non-anthropomorphic God is utterly incomprehensible. An attempt is made to ground the incomprehen- sible Absolute within each one's own personal experience thus making it more than a mere assertion or theoretical concept and establishing it as an indubitable fact of experience. (p. 6) This should keep us going for quite a while! One must begin by recognizing the limitations of these claims when made in the name of Advaita Vedanta. Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 46, Number 1 January 1996 91-105 ? 1996 by University of Hawai'i Press 91 Arvind Sharma</page><page sequence="2">Philosophy East &amp; West The first assertion claims that the referent of religious discourse "is the one indubitable fact of experience, which can never be denied without self-contradiction" (p. 6). Such language in Advaita is typically employed in relation to the Self, so it may be presumed that that is what is intended by the statement,' vide Sankara's commentary on Brahma- sCtra 1.1.1 and 11.3.7.2 However, whereas that'I am' is indubitable, what 'I am' is a subject of much controversy, as is admitted by Sahkara himself in his gloss on Brahmasutra 1.1.1. While he begins by axiomatically identifying the Self with Brahman-the standard Advaita position-he is aware of other views: Besides, the existence of Brahman is well known from the fact of Its being the Self of all; for everyone feels that his Self exists, and he never feels, "I do not exist." Had there been no general recognition of the existence of the Self, everyone would have felt, "I do not exist." And that Self is Brahman. Opponent: If Brahman be well known in the world as the Self, then It being already known, there arises the difficulty again that It is not to be deliberated on. Vedantin: No, for there is a conflict about Its distinctive nature. Ordinary people as well as the materialists of the Lokayata school recognize the body alone to be the Self possessed of sentience. Others hold that the mind is the Self. Some say that it is merely momentary consciousness. Others say that it is a void. Still others believe that there is a soul, separate from the body, which transmigrates and is the agent (of work) and the experiencer (of results). Some say that the soul is a mere experiencer and not an agent. Some say that there is a God who is different from this soul and is all-knowing and all-powerful; others say that He is the Self of the experiencing individual. Thus there are many who follow opposite views by depending on logic, texts and their semblances. If one accepts any one of these views without examination, one is liable to be deflected from emancipation and come to grief.3 Grimes admits both these possibilities: of the Self being identified with the Absolute by the "qualified aspirant" and only indirectly by the "un-qualified aspirant." Note that for both, the epistemic status involves assertion, not realization. Thus, though for both it is cognitive, it can really be valid only for the jTvanmukta. The indubitable fact of its expe- rience may be empirically given but it is not yet valid in the strict sense of the term, prior to Self-realization-a fact not mentioned by Grimes. More seriously, the indubitable existence of the Self axiomatically assumed by Grimes is questionable from both ends of the philosophical spectrum: extreme materialism and extreme idealism. From the point of view of extreme materialism, consciousness itself is an epiphenomenon of matter; therefore the consciousness of Self must also be an epiphe- nomenon of matter. In that case the consciousness of Self as indubitable is a false consciousness, for the ultimate reality underlying the Self is material-a position identified with the Carvakas (dehatmavada) that even some Advaitins have conceded as logically irrefutable.4 92</page><page sequence="3">Similarly, extreme subjective idealism in the form of the doctrine of ekajTvavada5 also casts doubt on the 'indubitability' of the consciousness of the Self as constituting the unsublatable proof of its existence. It is true that Sahkara is opposed to this doctrine,6 although some late Advaitins adopted it; but the issue it raises is that if there is only one jTva-"only a solitary self and that everything is [Its] mere fancy"-then there is no "reason to believe in external physical objects" and also "no reason to believe in other people except as part of his dream." Our sense of in- dubitably possessing a Self would then be about as convincing as the people we dream in our dream imagining themselves to be real because they exist in our dreams. (One is reminded here of a TV documentary on dreams made by the BBC in which a person dreams that he is lighting a cigarette for a blonde. As a lucid dreamer, he is conscious, while dreaming, that he is dreaming [unlike most of us ordinary dreamers]. So he says to her as he lights the cigarette: "You do realize that you are a figment of my imagination." "Maybe," she replies, "but can't we go on meeting like this?") Hence the "indubitability" that Grimes attributes to the consciousness of the Self must contend with the "irrefutability" of the extreme versions of both materialism and idealism.7 Hence it is only the apparent sense of self-existence that cannot be denied without self-contradiction. And Descartes is proof that this can lead in a direction very different from that of Advaita-and in a theistic direction on top of it! The second assertion pertains to the other pole of the Atman-Brah- man identity. Doubtless if Brahman is identified with Atman, as is indeed the case in standard Advaita, the "establishment of the spiritual character of this principle and the removal of the uncertainty about its existence are both accomplished by its identification with atman or the Self. For our own self is known to us to be spiritual, and there is an intuitive ob- ligation to recognize it, in some sense, as indubitable."8 However, one of the mighty statements or mahavakyas in the Ad- vaitic tradition is tat tvam asi, "that thou art" (Chandogya Upanisad IV.13.3), and its traditional exegesis is theistic rather than absolutistic, in the sense that the jTva is said to be identical with Tsvara.9 I have expressed my dissatisfaction with such an understanding of this mahavakya,'0 and John Grimes has done so even more vigorously.11 But the point remains that traditional Advaita was quite willing to give a theistic dimension to such a central Advaitic statement. My reason for commencing this review by a critical examination of the central assertions of the book is to suggest that a slight realignment of the focus of these assertions, made well within the parameters that the very same system of Advaita Vedanta so skillfully presented by the au- thor, may lead us to modify these assertions as follows. 1. The original version of the first assertion claims that the referent of Arvind Sharma 93</page><page sequence="4">religious discourse is immediately and therefore indubitably given in Advaita. One could modify the assertion to claim that if one considers Brahman not as something "objective but as identical at bottom with the individual self ... it is thus eventually through something in ourselves that, according to Sahkara, we are able to judge of reality and unreality."12 2. The original version of the second assertion claims that it is "more philosophically and logically consistent to speak of the unqualified Ab- solute than of a theistic deity." This claim seems to rest on too sharp a distinction between nirguna and saguna brahman, according to which saguna brahman, personified as God, is visualized as a distant anthro- pomorphic God while nirguna brahman, or the unqualified Absolute, is identified as something immediate, grounded "within each one's own personal experience thus making it... an indubitable fact of experience" unlike the former. It is true that the distinction between saguna and nirguna brahman is a key distinction in Advaita Vedanta. But this key should not be turned in such a way as to shut the door to the fact that both saguna and nirguna represent two aspects of the same brahman and that it may be precisely for this reason that the religious discourse opened up by the discussion of brahman can unselfconsciously be both theistic and absolutistic and need not necessarily be only absolutistic. The fact is that saguna and nirguna can be viewed as two aspects of the same Reality. It is gratifying that a popular textbook does not fail to note the point: "God as immanent (saguna) and God as transcendent (nirguna) are not two, any more than a man on the stage and a man outside the stage are two."13 As M. Hiriyanna is at pains to explain, "Saguna Brahman includes not merely reality but also appearance, which is something less than the real. The element of reality in it is the ultimate of Advaita" so that properly speaking the "Nirguna Brahman is not the negation or antithesis of Saguna, but its very truth and it is im- manent in everything that goes to constitute it."14 Philosophy East &amp; West II According to the author, "The purpose of this book is an attempt to show that, because of its radically unique metaphysical standpoint, Ad- vaita Vedanta's use and understanding of religious statements is not subject to these common criticisms which are leveled against other sys- tems. Advaita, it is true, may be subject to other criticisms. It is my claim that incoherence and self-contradiction is not one of them" (p. 4). In section I above, I questioned the two basic assertions of the author that frame the book. In this section I shall tentatively accept them in or- der to assess whether the book has achieved its purpose, fallen short of it, surpassed it, or "all of the above." Religious discourse raises the following issues: (1) "Does language 94</page><page sequence="5">function differently when it is used to make statements about God?" and (2) "How is one to distinguish false statements about God from true ones?" (p. 7). These two problems have given rise to three distinct sets of theories about religious language: the cognitive, the noncognitive, and the quasi-cognitive.15 John Grimes seems to make the claim that the first set of problems is caused by accepting the phenomenon of "difference" as real (pp. 163 ff.)--which it is not. That makes short work of theories devised to handle the issues arising from taking difference as real, such as those of causation, for example (pp. 146 ff.). For the second question, Grimes claims that, unlike God, the Ad- vaitic reality can be directly known and thus verified. The criticism of difference and causation in connection with the first question is a time- honored one in Advaita Vedanta16 and here Grimes rehearses the argu- ments, although in an engaging way. It is in his answer to the second question that Grimes has to depart from or, shall we say, even transcend tradition. The basic question to be confronted here is: how is Brahman known? This breaks down into two questions: what is the external means of our knowledge of the existence of Brahman, and what is the internal process through which we come to know Brahman experientially? On the first point Grimes is content to follow received tradition that "the Absolute can be known only through religious statements (sabda pra- mana)" (p. 18) made in the Vedas,17 but not without some original em- bellishment of this traditional position. Grimes identifies "at least six different methods" (pp. 62 ff.) that Ad- vaita Vedantins employ to convey Self-knowledge, which leads to the question: can language directly point to the Absolute? Grimes distin- guishes here between first-level and second-level language statements, and he identifies (1) the mahavakyas18 and (2) the definitions of Brahman in esse as "First level language statements" (p. 139). At this point he thus makes two original suggestions, though both are rooted in the same insight: that the Absolute can be signified directly both through what in Advaita Vedanta are traditionally called mahava- kyas and what are called svarupalaksanas. The svaropalaksanas define Brahman per esse. The mahavakyas identify Brahman with Atman. With respect to both these classes of statements, traditional Advaita has devised elaborate doctrines as to how exactly the mahavakyas pro- duce the required knowledge of identity, and how words can indicate that which is beyond words, the ineffable Brahman.19 Grimes is ready to cut the scholastic knots formed by the thickening threads of a tradition extending over centuries with one Alexandrian sword swipe: the words produce immediate knowledge. The key term he uses here, which applies in both cases, is that of an 'identity statement'- a statement that states the identity of one thing with another or with itself. Grimes writes: Arvind Sharma 95</page><page sequence="6">An identity statement can assert a single content. It can do so by either expressing identity or else by giving a definition or description. In the former, one begins with a unique type of tautology. Though the expression, "A is identical with B" (tat tvam asi) begins with difference as its starting point, through sublation, knowledge of identity is reached. The existence of a single content is asserted once the accidental and apparent determinants are negated. The "pot-ether" is identical to the "space-ether" and neither deter- minant (pot or space) affects the identity of the ether. The pot-enclosed ether and the ether outside have the same ontological status. Though they appear to be different, they are not really so. (p. 143) He then goes on to say: The second type of identity statement expresses knowledge of a single object by definition or description. Usually a definition or description expresses a relation of one thing to another. But here all the individual words of the sen- tence refer only to one entity. Whether it be, "the present President of the United States is Clinton" or "satyam jfnanam anantam brahma," both expres- sions convey only identity. Usually "satyam jinanam anantam brahma" is in- terpreted in a secondary sense because the Absolute is considered to be beyond all determinations and attributes. Thus, satyam is used to indicate that the Absolute is not unreal; jnfanam is used to indicate that the Absolute is not unconscious; and anantam is used to indicate that it is not finite. But it can be maintained that anyone who understands the mahavakyas will immediately know that Brahman, satyamr, j,nanam, anantam are all referring to the same content. Brahman is satyam and jinanam is anantam, and so forth. The text produces the knowledge asked for, viz., "What is Brahman?" (p. 144, em- phasis added) According to the traditional exegesis, the three expressions define unqualified Brahman by being applied to Brahman simultaneously rather than individually and simultaneously qualifying one another as well. Grimes maintains that they can convey the import directly to "anyone who understands the mahavakyas" (p. 144, emphasis added). This raises the question: how are the mahavakyas understood? Grimes has already answered the question. Directly (pp. 141-142). I for one see much merit in the author's suggestion. It possesses that genius which Goethe attributes to boldness. III There is a point to be made that the problems and perspectives of religious discourse do possess different contours depending on whether the landscape involved is absolutistic or theistic. For instance, God in his role as mayin (Svetjavatara Upanisad4.9) "is sometimes spoken of as the great Magician who brings forth out of himself the whole spectacle of the universe. The point of comparison with a magician is that he is in no way deluded by that spectacle as others are...."20 In this case, then, the Philosophy East &amp; West Magician is real, the magic is not. But in the context of Maya, in its ab- 96</page><page sequence="7">solutistic usage, all are unreal-the Magician, the spectacle, and the spectators. Similarly, God may be said to share in our sorrow but not sin, while no such distinction is possible in relation to the Absolute. The dif- ference in the two modes of discourse is also confirmed by the usage of "union" in depicting the relationship between the subject and the Ab- solute and of "communion" between the subject and God. All this sup- ports Grimes' basic contention that a distinction needs to be maintained between absolutistic religious discourse and theistic religious discourse, and even the rules of the game may differ, as between American football and British rugby. There is, however, also some evidence that sometimes the territory may overlap, making the partition rather porous. Consider, for instance, the following famous passage from the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad(lV.5.6): Then spake he: Lo, verily, not for love of the husband is a husband dear, but for love of the Soul (Atman) a husband is dear. Lo, verily, not for love of the wife is a wife dear, but for love of the Soul a wife is dear. Lo, verily, not for love of the sons are sons dear, but for love of the Soul sons are dear. Lo, verily, not for love of the wealth is wealth dear, but for love of the Soul wealth is dear. Lo, verily, not for love of the cattle are cattle dear, but for love of the Soul cattle are dear. Lo, verily, not for love of Brahmanhood is Brahmanhood dear, but for love of the Soul Brahmanhood is dear. Lo, verily, not for love of Kshatrahood is Kshatrahood dear, but for love of the Soul Kshatrahood is dear. Lo, verily, not for love of the world are the worlds dear, but for love of the Soul the worlds are dear. Lo, verily, not for love of the gods are the gods dear, but for love of the Soul the gods are dear. Lo, verily, not for love of Vedas are the Vedas dear, but for love of the Soul Vedas are dear. Lo, verily, not for love of the being (bhuta) are beings dear, but for love of the Soul beings are dear. Lo, verily, not for love of all is all dear, but for love of the Soul all is dear. Lo, verily, it is the Soul (Atman) that should be seen, that should be heark- ened to, that should be thought on, that should be pondered on, O Maitrey.21 This Upanisad in general, and this section in particular, is considered predominantly absolutistic, and yet the Advaitin T.M.P. Mahadevan has this to say about it: "As Yajiiavalkya teaches his wife MaitreyT in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, the Self or God is the seat of supreme love."22 Another Advaitin, R. K. Tripathi, carries the exegesis forward in a tanta- lizing direction: Arvind Sharma 97</page><page sequence="8">Philosophy East &amp; West Consider the question of love. Apparently love requires duality but really is it possible for one being to love another who is completely different? Love requires some kind of unity and tends to realize that unity which is obscured by apparent difference. Love is the merger of one into the other. The biblical sentence "Not my will but Thy will be done" means just such an achieve- ment of unity with the Lord; self-will or self-identity is inconsistent with love. Only that can be really loved which is our self or only that which is ourself can be really loved. If God is the wholly other, one may stoop to Him and fear Him but one cannot love Him. This is the significance of the famous saying of the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad that everything is dear to us for the sake of self: even God is dear to us just for that reason. If we love God it only means that we want to make Him our very self and this can be done only if He is already our self, not the present self but the deeper or the higher self; the distinction between the lover and the beloved is there, but it is of levels only; love is the attraction felt by the lower self for the higher self; prayer and worship also should be understood in the same way. No real communion is possible between man and God so long as a real gap between the two is admitted.23 This compels one to ask: is this an absolutistic attempt to grasp a theistic insight in absolutistic terms, and is the Judeo-Christian claim that "in the image of God was man created" (Gen. 9:5) an attempt to grasp an absolutistic insight on theistic terms? Moreover, when the identity of Brahman and Atman is established, the world of nature, also comprised in Brahman, is rarely identified with Atman. M. Hiriyanna seems to bypass the point, as most Advaitins do, when he says: the ultimate teaching of Advaita is the sole reality of Brahman. The unity taught here, no doubt, includes both man and nature; but as the first and foremost interest of man is man himself and not nature, the truth as embodied in 'that thou art' or the fundamental unity of the individual and the absolute is given prominence in the teaching. The disciple has accordingly to concen- trate his attention on this aspect of the doctrine, and look upon the other, relating to nature, as more or less secondary.24 Grimes does not seem to acknowledge the point which Hiriyanna does albeit to a limited extent.25 Theism, both Hindu and Western, arguably incorporates Nature as such more consciously into religious discourse. It may also not be inappropriate at this juncture to add that in relation to the world, a favorite Advaitin proof against the existence of God is that from a finite world we can only infer a finite God. But is the world finite? And may the Infinite not give rise to something finite? Moreover, the di- lemmas considered unique to theism may not be so. The problem with the proposition "God is good" unfolds as follows: Is goodness an ex- ternal criterion? If it is, another entity has been set up beside God. If it inheres in God, it becomes arbitrary: whatever God decrees is good. But Brahman-realization-poses similar dilemmas. In fact, here the earlier 98</page><page sequence="9">discussion on the Brhadaranyaka passage gets slightly inverted. It has been remarked that realization "means the realization of the identity of the individual soul with the supreme Soul. This identity is qualitative and not quantitative, and hence the recognition of the fact by Jnanadeva that the knower of Brahman remains slightly different from Brahman Itself, in spite of the identity between the two."26 Similarly, the operation of grace will presumably have little place in Grimes' scheme, but Appayya DTk- sita fascinates us with the following possibility: "It is by the grace of God that one's mind turns towards Advaita!"27 Similarly, Brahman is said to be devoid of jati (class), guna (quality), kriya (action), and sambandha (relation) and therefore not a fit object of speech-but is It not in a class by itself, is It not nirguna and niskriya (without quality and action) that confirm its unique class, and is It not brought in relation to the universe in the very process of the raising of the issue whether it is or not? The point of these foregoing remarks is (1) to agree with Grimes in general that absolutistic and theistic discourses might well be distinct in some ways but then also to differ with him by suggesting (2) that they may be similar in other ways and that (3) therefore they may be treated as distinct but not separate, in the sense that similar general issues might characterize both to such an extent that to insist that the implication of Advaita Vedanta for religious discourse consists in simply doing away with the issues may not be consistent with the evidence. Some pieces of evidence on the isomorphic nature of nontheistic and theistic religious discourse are provided below, which suggest to me that it might be more fair to claim the comparability of these issues than their resolution, even absolution, in absolutistic discourse compared to their perverse (?) per- sistence in theistic discourse! IV 1. To love something is also to know it, and to know something is also to love it. If the remark is true even to a limited extent, then the se- vere separation of the cognitive and affective domains may be possible in thought but not in fact. For instance, it is well known that one may fail for either cognitive or affective reasons to describe something fully, or at all. The Cloud of Unknowing is comparable to Bodhidharma's "I do not know." 2. In his gloss on Brahmasutra 2.1.34, Saikara, in explaining God's relationship to karma, writes: No fault attaches to God, since this unequal creation is brought about in conformity with the virtues and vices of the creatures that are about to be born. Rather, God is to be compared to rain. Just as rainfall is a common cause for the growth of paddy, barley, etc., the special reasons for the differ- ences of paddy, barley, etc., being the individual potentiality of the respective seeds, similarly God is the common cause for the birth of gods, men, and Arvind Sharma 99</page><page sequence="10">others, while the individual fruits of works associated with the individual creatures are the uncommon causes for the creation of the differences among the gods, men, and others.28 This is strikingly similar to what the Lotus Sutra has to say about Bud- dha's teaching: The Buddha's undifferentiated preaching Is, like the rain, of a single flavour, In accord with the being's natures Differently received, Just as what those grasses and trees Receive is in every case different.29 3. Consider love and ignorance. Both are homogeneous by them- selves and become particularized only when directed toward something. Sarkara exempts not only God but also ignorance as the cause of in- equality: "Nor ignorance by itself is a source of this, it being homoge- neous."30 But this is how compassion may also be distinguished from partiality, for the Bodhisattva's compassion possesses such homogeneous universality. 4. God is everywhere, so is the ekajTva in the ekajTvavada. Both are the sole realities of their world. If that jTva is Isvara, does the distinction between monism and theism disappear? 5. Consider the following two porcine stories-one Buddhist, the other Hindu. First the Buddhist: When he reached the point of death this monk said to the disciples who stood around him: "Well, my friends and pupils, my time on earth is finished in this form. But I am going to be born again, since I have a few sins left to expiate. I shall be born as a small pig from that sow of ours who is shortly to give birth to a litter. I shall be one of her piglets, and as soon as I am born please make sure to kill me, so that I may be released for another birth in which to travel further on the Path. Don't forget to kill me immediately." Having said this, he died. Three days later the sow produced her litter. The disciples were sup- posed to kill them all, since they could not know which was their reincar- nated master. But one of the monks said: "The little pigs are so nice. Let us keep them for a week and then kill them." "If we do that," said another, "we must truly kill them after a week. It was the order of the guru." A week later the disciples, one of them armed with a knife, gathered again at the sty. There they saw the piglets, lying peacefully in the mud and dirt. But when the exe- cutioner approached, one little pig looked up and said, in a voice which the disciples recognised, "Don't kill me now, I like it!"31 We now set alongside this the following: Once God incarnated himself as a female boar, and gave birth to a number of Philosophy East &amp; West pigs. The boar lived in a dirty place very happily with her young ones. She 100</page><page sequence="11">became so attached to the life she lived that when the time came for the Lord to return to heaven, she did not want to leave the world. The gods in heaven became perturbed at the long absence of the Lord, and going to Shiva they prayed to him that he must save the situation. He went down to the place where the boar lived and killed it with a stroke of his trident. At once, the Supreme Self left the body of the boar, smiling resplendent and went to the region of heaven.32 6. We tend to turn our nose up at miracles as theistic proofs in the world of nature, but does this not sound like its cerebral counterpart- that, according to Advaita, "in certain cases it is possible for scriptural purport to be determined even in opposition to other pramanas, for the pramanas which apprehend purport are the sadliiga and not 'non- opposition to other prama.nas.' 33 7. The problem of how we know that it is God whom we encounter when we encounter God34 is not unlike how we know we have realized Brahman when It is realized.35 Moreover, if "the only one to judge whether a person has become a mukta or not is himself,"36 the problem raised by Kumarila against the saint (yogin) resurfaces: "a 'vision' which unfolded itself to but one single person may after all be an illusion. This is not to impugn the good faith of the saint; it only means that the ex- cellence of the character of a teacher is no guarantee of his teaching."37 It may be urged that it is precisely to guard against this pitfall that Ku- marila appeals to the collective sruti. But people have fallen victim to collective illusions, such as the flatness of the earth, as well. 8. To end on a properly technical rather than general note, in de- scribing Brahman as nirguna and saguna and God in relation to neces- sary and contingent being, are we still not left with the problem of de- scribing them? The example of direct and alternating current has been used in relation to both,38 but as John Hick asks, is it not that "We do not learn what electricity is by being told that some electrical circuits are alternating and others are a direct current; likewise, we do not know what it is to exist by being told that some things exists necessarily and others contingently" or that Brahman is both saguna and nirguna? The point, then, is that religious discourse is a complex affair and, contrary to the claim by Grimes that the implication of Advaita Vedanta for this discourse is that it unravels this complexity, I submit that it par- takes in it. What Grimes to my mind has accomplished in this marvelous book is to demonstrate that religious discourse in Advaita Vedanta pro- ceeds from "down here" and not from "out there," that "Advaita starts, not with a disembodied Absolute, but with the embodied individual, here and now" (p. 173). Had Sankara himself caught on to this? Why would he write a preamble to the Brahmasutra that focuses almost en- tirely on the embodied individual when the first aphorism of the text it- self speaks not of jTva or even Atman but Brahman!39 Arvind Sharma 101</page><page sequence="12">Philosophy East &amp; West V This is a remarkable book, and the criticisms offered above are really disguised compliments.40 The book situates Advaita Vedanta firmly at the nuclear core of contemporary discussions of religious discourse in the philosophy of religion, and whether the outcome be fission or fusion a lot of philosophical energy is bound to be released in the process.

This identity of denotation of the two terms (p. 21), jTva and the qualified Brahman, while their connotations are different, is the advaitic interpretation of "That thou art" (tat tvam asi). It does not mean, as it is so often represented to do, that man and the qualified Brahman or God (to use a term which we shall soon explain) are as such one. Such an attitude is as blasphemous, according to Advaita, as it is according 102</page><page sequence="13">to any religion or purely theistic doctrine" (Hiriyanna, Essentials of Indian Philosophy, pp. 163-164). 10 - Arvind Sharma, The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta: A Comparative Study in Religion and Reason (University Park, Penn- sylvania: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995), p. 110. 11 - "Literally it would seem that the words which comprise an identity statement (akhandartha vakya) are not synonymous and thus one must resort to some sort of secondary meaning if one wishes to make their statement meaningful. 'This is that Devadatta' or 'aham brahmasmi' seem to reveal a prima facie absurdity. Yet such need not be the case. The real position of the Advaitin is that there is no need to resort to an implied meaning. In the Chandogya Upanisad context in which the statement 'tat tvam asi' appears, the word 'tat' does not refer to the omniscient lgvara. It refers to Brahman, which is said to be nirguna. And this nirguna Brahman is referred to by the word 'sat' which is attained by the individual in deep sleep, for it is said, 'My dear, it is satthat is attained.' Therefore, in as much as the word 'tat' occurs in the context of the discussion about nirguna Brahman, it cannot refer to the saguna Brahman. The text says, 'tat satyam' and sgvara, who is associated with nescience, cannot be real (satya). So the Upanisadic text says, 'O Svetaketu, you, the in- dividual, are that Brahman.' And how can the individual be Brah- man? It is said, 'sa atma' (that is the Self). It is well known that the individual is the Self, because the Self is the notion of the 'I'. And Brahman is the Self and thus it is tenable to say that the Self is Brahman. And this is said directly and without any need to resort to a secondary meaning of the word 'tat' or 'tvam"' (pp. 141-142). 12 - Hiriyanna, Essentials of Indian Philosophy, pp. 162-163. 13 - Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta, An In- troduction to Indian Philosophy (University of Calcutta, 1950), p. 398. 14 - Hiriyanna, Outlines of Indian Philosophy, pp. 371, 376. 15 - See John Hick, Philosophy of Religion, 4th ed.

The following comment puts us on guard against regarding this as a merely mod- ern interpretation: "In other words, he loves others not as such but as himself, because he feels his identity with them. That the knowledge of Upanisadic truth connotes such perfect love is beau- tifully shown by what (according to Suresvara) Yajnavalkya says to his wife, MaitreyT, in his joy at finding her eager to know that truth from him: 'Impelled by her great love for Siva, ParvatT has wrought herself into half of his frame, but you (with far greater love) are yearning to mingle with the whole of my being'" (M.

This is demonstrable in even a thinker like Kant who couldn't resist importing the distinctions of the world into the region of things-in-themselves. Furthermore, it is not that the Ad- vaitin declares that the world does not exist. The world is there, but, at the highest ontological level, there is no distinction or determi- nateness whatsoever. The Western approach generally accepts that the world is there and that one must become free from it. The distinction is real. But, according to the Advaitin, it is this very belief in distinctions which is the root of the problem. Both approaches look for a solution to the problem. The Absolute, Reality, or God becomes the goal towards which the finite individual strives. The goal is determined by the approach to be followed" (pp. 89-90). 26 - Haridas Bhattacharyya, ed., The Cultural Heritage of India (Calcutta: The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, 1956), vol. 4:362. Grimes alludes thus to the issue involved here: "Does Brahman know itself or is it known by some other knowing subject? Ob- viously Brahman cannot know itself, for one and the same entity cannot, at the same time, be both a knowing subject and the known object of knowledge. Knowledge implies a duality in which the Philosophy East &amp; West knower is other than the known. Yet, Brahman is said to be non- 104</page><page sequence="15">dual. Thus, the question may be asked, can one say that Brahman is known by some other object?" (p. 114). For every Ramakrsna who would claim that he wants to "taste sugar and not be sugar" there is bound to be a Ramana who asks: "Is Brahman insentient like sugar?"
