ABSTRACT An analysis was done of published forehead head impact data from cadaver specimens. Only data that were sufficiently docu- mented to allow duplication of the impact environment were used in the analysis. A Hybrid III head, a Part 572 head, a Repeatable Pete head and two WSU heads were subjected to the same impact environments as the cadavers. A comparison of peak resultant head accelerations indicated that the Hybrid III response was the most representative of the cadaver data. The Part 572 head pro- duced accelerations which were greater than the responses of the cadavers. These results support the claim that the Hybrid III head's response is humanlike for forehead impacts. THE HEAD USED ON THE HYBRID III DUMMY was devel- oped by Dr. Robert P. Hubbard and Donald G. McLeod as part of a GM Anthropomorphic Dummy Development Program. De- tailed descriptions of the conception, design and development of the head are given in two papers coauthored by Hubbard and McLeod (1, 2)*. The head was first used in 1972 as the head for the GM ATD 502 dummy, a 50th percentile adult male anthropo- morphic test dummy that was developed by GM under a contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (3). Many of the components of the GM ATD 502, including its head, were used in the development of the GM Hybrid III dummy (4). The head specified in the Hybrid III drawing pack- age (5) is the head that was developed by Hubbard and McLeod. Important features of the Hybrid III head are: - size, shape, weight and mass moment of inertia about the lateral axis that passes through its center of gravity that are representative of a 50th percentile adult male; - anatomically correct location of its center of gravity and head to neck interface; - humanlike forehead impact response; - excellent impact response repeatability and durability for cranial impacts; - excellent mid sagittal plane symmetry of response for cra- nial impacts; *Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. - excellent reproducibility of response between heads. Recently, Schneider et al (6) conducted a test program where cadaver specimens, a Hybrid III head and a Part 572 head were subjected to padded forehead impacts. Their results indicated that the Hybrid III acceleration response was 50 percent lower than the average of the cadaver responses. Based on this data, New- man and Gallup (7) have proposed to stiffen the forehead area of the Hybrid III head in order to make its padded forehead impact response compatible with Schneider's cadaver data. For padded forehead impacts produced with a given impactor mass and velocity, any head's acceleration response will be de- pendent on four factors: forehead stiffness and shape, head weight and padding stiffness. Neck compliance could also influ- ence the head's response, but in Schneider's tests only the head was used. Since the Hybrid III head was designed to have the shape and weight of a 50th percentile adult male head and its forehead stiffness was tuned to meet an acceleration response re- quirement that was based on cadaver data, one would expect the Hybrid III to have excellent biofidelity of acceleration response for padded forehead impacts. Schneider's test results are not con- sistent with this expectation. A three part program was undertaken by General Motors in an attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction between Schneider's test results and the expected response of the Hybrid III head. The first part of the GM program was to review Schneider's test pro- gram. The results of this review are given in a paper by Mertz (8). His review revealed that Schneider did not exercise control over the repeatability of the mechanical characteristics of the pad- ding material. Three pieces of padding material were used for over one hundred impact tests. Mertz 's analysis clearly demon- strated that Schneider's test results were confounded by changes in the material properties of the padding due to multiple impacts. They do not indicate differences in forehead impact responses be- tween the cadaver heads, the Hybrid III head or the Part 572 head. Obviously, the Hybrid III head modifications suggested by Newman and Gallup (7) may be totally inappropriate. The second part of the GM program was to document the re- sponse characteristics of a Hybrid III head and a Part 572 head in 5.97 0096-736X/86/9405-0097$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">well controlled, forehead impacts. The results of this test pro- gram are given in a report by Mertz et al (9). The third part of the GM program was to review the basis for the Hybrid III forehead stiffness and to search the literature for any additional information that could be used to evaluate the biodynamic response of the Hybrid III to forehead impacts. This report summarizes the findings of that effort. FLAT, RIGID SURFACE IMPACT RESPONSE BASIS FOR HYBRID III FOREHEAD IMPACT RESPONSE REQUIREMENT - The forehead impact response requirement for flat, rigid surface impacts specified by Hubbard and McLeod was based on cadaver response data of Hodgson and Thomas (10). In their tests, cadavers were strapped to a pallet that was free to pivot about one end. The cadaver's head and neck ex- tended over the free end. The pallet was rotated upwards to achieve a prescribed distance between the head and the impact surface. Then the pallet was released producing the desired head impact. The results from six cadaver tests (four cadavers with head to surface spacings of 10 inches, one cadaver with a spacing of 25 inches, and one with a 30 inch spacing) conducted with a flat, rigid surface served as the basis for the forehead impact re- sponse requirement. In these tests the foreheads of the cadavers were impacted, and each impact produced a skull fracture. Hub- bard and McLeod used the average peak acceleration of these six tests (250 g) as the midpoint of their biomechanical performance requirement and specified an allowable variation from the mid- point of ± 10 percent (±25 g). The drop height specified by Hubbard and McLeod of 376 mm (14.8 in) is the free fall height that produces an impact velocity of 8.9 ft/s which is the reported average impact velocity of the six cadaver tests. Figure 1 depicts the Hybrid III performance requirement for rigid surface forehead FIGURE 1 - Hybrid III Peak Resultant Head Acceleration Specification for Rigid Surface Forehead Impacts Compared to the Cadaver Data That Served as Its Basis (2) impacts and the cadaver data that served as its basis. The follow- ing section provides a review of that cadaver data. REVIEW OF SKULL FRACTURE DATA - In 1981 the SAE Human Biomechanics and Simulation Subcommittee re- viewed the cadaver results of Hodgson and Thomas (10). They noted that the impact velocities reported by Hodgson and Thomas were equal to the free fall velocities calculated from the values listed for the spacing between the head and the impact surface. A kinematic analysis of their rotating pallet device indicated that the subjects should have experienced head impact velocities greater than those calculated as free fall velocities from the head spacing data. Dr. Hodgson was advised of this concern and he conducted a series of calibration tests for his rotating pallet device. A light beam, interrupt device was used to accurately measure head im- pact velocity. A calibration curve for Hodgson's rotating pallet is given in Figure 2. This curve indicates that the head impact ve- locities reported by Hodgson and Thomas (10) are too low.

A plot of the peak head accelerations for their cadaver tests using the corrected head impact velocities and the Hybrid III performance requirement is given in Figure 3. The data point for Cadaver 1701 was not plotted because Hodgson has commented that its head acceleration trace was erratic and should not be used in any analysis. All the cadaver results shown in Figure 3 are for peak resultant head accelerations associated with skull fracture. These data indi- cate that skull fracture limits the peak acceleration experienced by the cadaver's head. It would be very difficult to design a durable dummy head to mimic both low and high velocity fracture data. It is desirable, however, for a durable head design to have biofi- delity of response up to the threshold of skull fracture. Since Hodgson considers the low velocity impact data as the threshold velocity for skull fracture, the three low velocity data points could be used as an estimate of the peak resultant acceleration 5.98</page><page sequence="3">851245 FIGURE 3 - Hybrid III Peak Resultant Head Acceleration Specification for Rigid Surface Forehead Impacts Compared to Hodgson's Corrected Skull Fracture Data response level for the threshold of skull fracture.

Four sources of rigid surface forehead im- pact data without skull fractures were found (11, 12, 13, and 14). McElhaney et al (11) give acceleration-time curves for six cadav- ers subjected to rigid forehead impacts using a 22 pound impac- tor. Unfortunately, the impact velocity for each test is not identified; only a broad impact velocity range is given. Stalnaker et al (12) report the results of a cadaver subjected to a rigid sur- face forehead impact using the same impact device. Again, the impact velocity is not reported. Even if the impact velocity was given, this data would be of little use in prescribing a meaningful dummy head response requirement because the impact environ- , ment was too severe. The cadaver experienced a peak resultant head acceleration of 515 g which far exceeds the peak head ac- celerations measured in simulated vehicle collisions. Hodgson and Thomas (13) give data for two cadavers sub- jected to rigid surface forehead impacts using their rotating pallet device. These data are summarized in Table 1. The head impact velocities listed were calculated using the calibration curve given in Figure 2. Cadaver 1699 was subjected to a single impact with- out skull fracture and Cadaver 1857 was subjected to two impacts without skull fracture. Hodson and Thomas (14) conducted a series of non fracture cadaver impact tests for the Vehicle Research Institute of the So- ciety of Automotive Engineers. Impacts were made to the fore- head, side of the head and back of the head of seven cadavers using their rotating pallet device. The rigid surface forehead im- pact data for the seven cadavers are summarized in Table 1. The peak head accelerations that are given were measured by acceler- ometers mounted on the side of the head near the lateral axis passing through the center of gravity of the head. The head im- pact velocities were calculated using the calibration curve of Figure 2. A plot of all the fracture and non fracture cadaver data listed in Table 1, except that of Cadaver 1701 which had erratic response, is given in Figure 4. Also shown is the Hybrid III performance FIGURE 4 - Hybrid III Peak Resultant Head Acceleration Specification for Rigid Surface Forehead Impacts Compared to Hodgson's Corrected Skull Fracture and Non Skull Fracture Data 5.99</page><page sequence="4">requirement for rigid surface forehead impacts. All these data were obtained for forehead impacts to a flat rigid surface using Hodgson's rotating pallet device. These data represent the pub- lished cadaver data for forehead impacts to flat, rigid surfaces that can be used to assess the biofidelity of the forehead stiffness of dummy heads. BIOFIDELITY OF DUMMY HEAD FOREHEAD STIFF- NESS - Hodgson has subjected a Hybrid III dummy to a num- ber of flat rigid surface forehead impacts using his rotating pallet device (15). The results of these tests are summarized in Table 1. For each of four head impact velocities, six Hybrid III tests were conducted. The average peak resultant head acceleration for each impact velocity is given in Table 1. The coefficient of variations for these tests ranged from 1.3 to 2.3 percent indicating excellent repeatablity. Figure 5 is a plot of the average peak resultant head acceleration of the Hybrid III dummy as a function of the equiva- lent free fall drop height calculated from the head impact velocity (V2/2g). Also shown are the cadaver data depicted in Figure 4 and the Hybrid III rigid surface forehead impact response specifi- cation. Note that the Hybrid III response curve obtained using Hodgson's rotating pallet device passes through the Hybrid III re- sponse specification for free fall forehead impacts to a flat rigid surface. The Hybrid III curve lies within the range of the low velocity non fracture cadaver data and within the range of the low velocity fracture data. Since it is a durable head, the Hybrid III response will not duplicate the high velocity fracture data, but will indicate an increasing level of acceleration with increasing impact velocity. Based on the data given in Figure 5, one can conclude that the forehead compliance of the Hybrid III dummy is humanlike up to the level of the threshold for skull fracture.

Also shown are the Part 572 and Hybrid III forehead impact response specifications. While the Part 572 response curve passes through its performance specifica- tion, it is 27 percent higher than the upper bound of the Hybrid III specification. FIGURE 6 - Peak Resultant Head Accelerations of a Part 572 Head for Rigid Surface Forehead Impacts Compared to the Hybrid III Specification McElhaney et al ( 1 6) developed a head for use on their crash test dummy, "Repeatable Pete". The head was a composite structure consisting of a solid skull made of Uralite 3121 which was covered by a softer layer of Uralite 3110. The exterior size and shape were similar to a 50th percentile male. Its weight was 1 1.6 pounds which is greater than the 10 pound head weight of a 50th percentile male. The forehead compliance was supposedly tuned to be comparable to a human's. A Repeatable Pete head was purchased by GM and subjected to a series of free fall fore- head impact tests to a flat rigid surface. The results of these tests are given in Table 2. The head demonstrated excellent repeatabil- ity with a coefficient of variation of 1 percent for the nine im- pacts conducted at a drop height of 305 mm. The averages of the peak resultant head accelerations as a function of free fall drop height are plotted in Figure 7. Note the response curve for Re- peatable Pete lies slightly below the response specification for the Hybrid III. If its head weight was reduced to 10 pounds, its re- sponse curve would probably fall within the Hybrid III response specification. Hodgson et al (17) developed a humanlike head for use in evaluation of helmet designs. Their head consists of self-skinning urethane foam skull covered by a silicon rubber skin. The crani- al cavity was originally filled with silicon fluid, but in their lat- est version glycerin is used. The exterior head size was chosen to be in the 7-1/8 to 7-1/4 hat size range. The head weight specified in their paper is 10 pounds. The response of the helmeted head was tuned to that of helmeted cadavers. Dr. Hodgson provided FIGURE 7 - Peak Resultant Head Accelerations of Repeatable Pete Head for Rigid Surface Forehead Impacts Compared to Hybrid III Specification GM with two medium size heads for impact testing. One head, WSU-1, had been used in many impact tests. The other head, WSU-2, was a newly manufactured head. Each head weighed 8.4 pounds. Since it was desired to compare their responses to the response of the Hybrid HI, lead shot was placed in the glycerin- filled cranial cavity of each head to bring its weight up to 10 pounds. Each head was subjected to a series of free fall, forehead impacts onto a flat rigid surface. Time between impacts was al- ways greater than 1 hour. The accelerometers used in the WSU heads were Endevco Model 2264. The results of these impacts are summarized in Table 2 and are plotted in Figure 8. Note that WSU-1 gave higher accelerations than the new head, WSU-2. Apparently, there is a slight change in the forehead stiffness of the head due to aging of the material and/or number of impacts. The responses of both heads lie below (11 percent for WSU-1 and 18 percent for WSU-2) the lower bound of the Hybrid III response specification. Figure 9 shows the response curves of peak resultant head ac- celeration versus impact severity (V2/2g) for the Hybrid III head, the Part 572 head, the Repeatable Pete head and the two WSU heads. Also depicted are the cadaver data of Hodgson and Thomas (10, 13, and 14) and the specifications for the Part 572 (210 to 260 g's for 254 mm drop) and Hybrid III (225 to 275 g's for 376 mm drop) responses to flat, rigid surface forehead im- pacts. Clearly, the Hybrid III curve is most representative of the cadaver data up to the threshold of skull fracture. The Part 572 head gives accelerations which are too high. The WSU head re- sponse is too low compared to the low velocity skull fracture data. Repeatable Pete's response is also somewhat low, but could be improved if its head weight was reduced. The Hybrid III re- sponse specification is consistent with the low velocity, threshold skull fracture data. The Part 572 response specification is defi- nitely too high compared to the cadaver data. Certainly one can 5.101</page><page sequence="6">conclude that the forehead stiffness of the Hybrid III head is hu- manlike up to the level of skull fracture. FIGURE 8 - Peak Resultant Head Accelerations of WSU-1 and WSU-2 Heads for Rigid Surface Forehead Impacts Compared to Hybrid III Specification FIGURE 9 - Peak Head Acceleration of Hybrid III, Part 572, Repeatable Pete, WSU-1, WSU-2 and Cadavers for Rigid Surface Forehead Impacts PADDED SURFACE IMPACT RESPONSE The padded forehead impact responses of the Hybrid III head and the Part 572 head were documented in the second part of the GM program and are presented in a separate report by Mertz et al (9). In their tests, a Hybrid III head and a Part 572 head were sub- jected to forehead impacts using a 27.2 pound pendulum impac- tor. A new piece of padding was used for each impact. Tests were conducted at impact velocities of 5, 10 and 15 mph using a variety of padding materials and thicknesses. Their results showed that the percent difference in the peak resultant head ac- celerations of the two dummy heads when subjected to the same impact conditions was not constant, but was dependent on pad- ding characteristics and impact velocity. This conclusion is clearly illustrated by the response curves shown by Figures 10 and 11. FIGURE 10 - Peak Head Acceleration of Part 572 and Hybrid III for Forehead Impacts Using a 27.2 Pound Pendulum Impactor with 1 Inch of Ensolite Type AL Padding. New Pad Used for Each Test The curves of Figure 10 were obtained using 1 inch of Ensolite Type AL padding. The data for these curves are given in Table 3. For each impact velocity, there was no significant difference in the peak resultant accelerations of each head. Since the forehead shapes and weights (9.9 pounds and 10.06 pounds for the Part 572 and Hybrid III, respectively) of the two dummy heads are almost identical, it can be concluded that the padding material completely masked the difference in their forehead stiffness in these tests. Furthermore, since their forehead shapes and weights are humanlike, it can be concluded that both heads would mimic human response in these tests. For the results shown by the graph of Figure 1 1 , impacts were conducted using 0.9" thick, 2 #/ft3 polyethylene padding. The data for these curves are given in Table 3. Peak resultant acceler- ations of the two heads were almost identical for the 5 and 10 mph impacts. For the 15 mph impacts, the peak resultant acceler- ation of the Part 572 head was greater than that of the Hybrid III head. Apparently at this impact level the padding loses its capac- ity to mask the difference in forehead stiffness with the stiffer Part 572 head undergoing a higher peak resultant acceleration. 5.102</page><page sequence="7">851245 500 - p / i / 400 - / y PART 572^^/ / 0 / / 1 300 - / X o / / HYBRID III // □ // &lt; / / - /V S UJ 200 - / // / UJ / / y 100 ~ ^ I I i i I 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 V2 2g ~ mm FIGURE 11 - Peak Head Accelerations of Part 572 and Hybrid III for Forehead Impacts Using a 27.2 Pound Pendulum Impactor With 0.9" Thick, 2#/FT3 Polyethylene Padding. New Pad Used for Each Test Since the Hybrid III forehead stiffness is humanlike and that of the Part 572 is too stiff, one can conclude that the Hybrid III peak resultant acceleration mimics human response for this im- pact while the Part 572 head indicates an acceleration level greater than that which a human would experience. A literature review was done to identify padded forehead im- pact data obtained using cadavers. In most of the papers (6, 11, 12, 14, 16-23), the authors either did not provide sufficient infor- mation about the characteristics of the padding and/or the test conditions to allow duplication of the impact environment or mul- tiple tests were conducted using the same piece of padding with- out assuring that the padding characteristics remained constant. In most of these papers, the primary objective was to derive rela- tionships between head kinematic responses (peak accelerations, HIC values) and observed brain damage or intracranial fluid pres- sures. To meet this objective there was no need to control or characterize the padded interface materials that were used. How- ever, a well controlled, repeatable impact environment is abso- lutely essential if the data are to be used to specify padded forehead impact performance requirements for dummy heads. The problems associated with the use of padded impact data are dis- cussed by Mertz (8) and Mertz et al (9). An effort was made to duplicate one of the padded impact en- vironments reported by Nusholtz et al (24). They subjected four cadavers to padded forehead impacts using a 55 pound pendulum impactor. The padding material was described a 1 inch thick En- solite. The skull of one of the cadavers fractured on the first im- pact and this data will not be used. The other three cadavers were impacted twice. The data for these tests are given in Table 3. While the authors do not comment on whether or not a new piece of padding was used for each impact, the fairly repeatable impact responses observed for these cadavers warranted an effort to du- TABLE 3 - Dummy and Cadaver Test Results For Padded Forehead Impacts n.nnmo IMPACT V?

A Hybrid III head was suspended in front of a 55 pound pen- dulum impactor using a 2.8 m cord that was attached to the ceil- ing. The head was oriented with its anterior-posterior axis (x-axis) at 45 degrees to horizontal and its mid-sagittal plane was aligned to be coplanar with the swing plane of the pendulum im- pactor. The head was positioned vertically and horizontally so that its forehead would just contact the center of the impactor' s load surface at the bottom of the impactor' s arc. Impacts of 5, 10, 12.5, and 15 mph were obtained by releasing the pendulum from the appropriate drop height. A new piece of 1 inch thick Ensolite Type AL padding material was used for each impact. The results of these impacts are listed in Table 3. Figure 12 de- picts the peak resultant acceleration of the Hybrid III head as a function of V2/2g. Also shown are Nusholtz et al cadaver data listed Table 3. The comparison between the cadaver data and the Hybrid III response curve is excellent even though the cadaver data were not normalized for differences in head weight and size, and there is no assurance that Nusholtz et al used a new piece of padding for each impact or that the same type of Ensolite material was used in the cadaver and dummy tests. LONG DURATION FOREHEAD IMPACTS For long duration forehead impacts, the head's acceleration re- sponse will be influenced by the rearward bending compliance of the neck structure. Foster et al (4) have shown that the rearward 5.103</page><page sequence="8">FIGURE 12 - Peak Head Accelerations of Cadavers and a Hybrid III Dummy for Forehead Impacts Using a 55 Pound Impactor With 1 Inch of Ensolite Padding bending response of the Hybrid III neck structure is humanlike and that of the Part 572 dummy is too stiff. If the padding masks the difference in forehead stiffness, then the Hybrid III will expe- rience humanlike head accelerations and the Part 572 will experi- ence accelerations which are lower than those a human would experience. If a short duration, high acceleration spike occurs during a long duration forehead impact, the Hybrid III accelera- tion response will be humanlike. The Part 572 response will not be humanlike. It should be noted that the neck's influence on head acceleration cannot be determined from unembalmed ca- daver tests. The unembalmed cadaver's neck is extremely flaccid and therefore its bending response is not humanlike. RECOMMENDATIONS If additional cadaver head impact data are obtained in the fu- ture, the following precautions should be taken: 1. If padding is to be used, its response characteristics should be carefully documented preferably using a rigid impactor with a spherical impact face. 2. Repeat impacts using the same piece of padding should be done only if it can be demonstrated that the impacts do not alter the material properties of the padding. 3. Multiple impacts to the same area of a cadaver's head should be avoided, especially for rigid surface impacts and padded impacts that produce high head accelerations. 4. In order to assure proper head weight, the vascular system of the cadaver must be pressurized and a humanlike CSF pressure must be maintained. 5. Care must be exercised in measuring the cadaver's head weight to assure that it is the same as it was for the impact tests. To analyze the results of such tests, an analytical study needs to be done to develop normalization relationships between peak head acceleration, head stiffness, head shape, head weight, and padding characteristics. SUMMARY The analysis presented in this report supports the claim that the Hybrid III head gives humanlike response for forehead impacts. This claim is based on four facts: the shape of its forehead area and its weight are representative of a 50th percentile male, the rearward bending response of the Hybrid III neck structure is humanlike, and its forehead stiffness is humanlike. The basis for its size and weight are well documented by Hubbard and McLeod (1, 2). The basis for claiming that the rearward bending stiffness of the Hybrid III neck structure is humanlike is discussed by Fos- ter et al (4). The cadaver response data shown in Figure 9 pro- vide the basis for the claim that the forehead stiffness of the Hybrid III is humanlike. No data were found to refute the claim that the Hybrid III response to forehead impacts is humanlike. REFERENCES 1. Hubbard, R. P. and McLeod, D.
