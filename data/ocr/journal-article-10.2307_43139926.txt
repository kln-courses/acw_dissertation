FRANCIS</page><page sequence="2">Years more view masterpieces ago, of widely Renaissance when held of an Renaissance than exclusively culture it is was today, art secular much were the view of Renaissance culture was much more widely held than it is today, the masterpieces of Renaissance art were valued for their qualities of form and for their contributions to the « discovery of man and na- ture », as Jakob Burckhardt put it C). Thus in Giovanni Bellini's panel in the Frick Collection, one of the most beautiful paintings of the Quat- trocento, it was the landscape, and often nothing but the landscape, that stirred the enthusiasm of critics (Fig. 1). Mr. Berenson, for instance, who gave us the first and still the fullest account of the picture, wrote in 1916 that the painter himself as well as his client must have understood the picture as pure landscape. For both, he said, St. Francis was nothing more than a necessary pious pretext (2). While everyone today shares Mr. Berenson's enthusiasm for Bellini's painting of nature, few I think would accept his estimate of the picture as a whole or of the role of the saint in it. It does not seem so easy now to avert one's glance from this ecstatic figure, his arms opened wide, his head and body bent backwards, his mouth open as he looks up to heaven - awed, anguished, and with the unfathomable darkness of passion that had already clouded the faces of similar saints by Masaccio and Donatello (Fig. 2). Titian himself was deeply impressed by this figure; his St. Francis in the Pesaro Altarpiece assures us of that (Fig. 3). In this later version the saint is far less tense, but he has retained the physiognomy, the gesture, the movement of the fingers of the right hand, and even much of the pattern of folds in the habit. Amidst the massive figures of Titian's developed style the St. Francis has a strikingly Quattrocento, early Bellinesque look. The position of the two hands continued to be associated with St. Francis, and more particularly with the Stigmatization, as late as the eighteenth century, in for example Tiepolo's modello in the Seilern Collection in London. Altogether, we feel, Bellini's saint is one of the most moving portrayals of religious rapture in Christian art. But what is the significance of the saint's transport ? Is it ideal and timeless, or is there some specific occasion for it ? Scholars 0) Civilization of the Renaissance , Part IV. Mr. Franklin Biebel, director of the Frick Collection, has for several years shared my interest in the problems presented by Bellini's painting, and I am deeply indebted to him for facilitating my study in every possible way. When it appeared that X-rays of the picture could be useful, he revised the Collection's schedule of X-ray photography so as to make them available to me sooner. I have learned much from discussions of the painting with him and with other friends, particularly Howard McP. Davis and Craig H. Smith. Mr. William Suhr, conservator of the Frick Collection, generously made many helpful comments on technique and problems of condition. (2) Venetian Painting in America, New York, 1916, pp. 95-105. Later F. J. Mather, Jr. advanced a similar view ( Venetian Painters , New York, 1936, pp. 99-100). « The picture is a landscape », he says, « and as such offers no problems ». And he adds, perceptively, « while the literal theme is the receiving of the stigmata, it is represented as a natural and benign event, like drawing a deep breath and realizing the lovely freshness of the morning ».</page><page sequence="3">12 Meiss - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS have bestowed on the painting a variety of titles. They have called it The Ecstasy of St. Francis (3), or St. Francis in the Desert (4), The Stigmatization of St. Francis (5) or a moment just after it (6), or simply St. Francis (7). All of this reflects un- certainty. What is surprising however is not the lack of conviction - indeed the present paper will not succeed in attaining that - but the absence of any discussion of the question itself. In fact, given the great beauty and historical importance of the painting, the literature on any aspect of it is remarkably scanty. In the developing art of landscape painting Bellini's St. Francis had already been preceded in the fifteenth century by several extraordinary portrayals of nature, notably Fra Angelico's Visitation in Cortona, Domenico Veneziano's tondo in Berlin, and the Baptism by Piero della Francesca in London. Bellini's picture is thus certainly not the first great Italian accomplishment in this field, but it is undoubtedly the richest. Only outside the peninsula, in Netherlandish paintings, does landscape exhibit a similar wealth of natural forms. Now Bellini undoubtedly knew works by Jan van Eyck and his successors, and these paint- ings offered him not only descriptions of a marvellously bright, multiform world but a novel technique with which to portray it. This technique, in which oil was added to the medium, he adopted in the early 'seventies, for the first time perhaps in the Pesaro Coronation (Fig. 6) (8). The Frick panel, which is generally placed between 1479 and 1485 but which actually followed the Coronation I believe by only a few years, shows a greater mastery of it. Following the Netherlanders Bellini reversed the time - honored convention of building up layers of color from dark to light, and laid the darker browns of the rocks and the greens of the vegetation over the light blue-green that was initially painted across the lower area of the picture. The glowing plants and flowers were produced by a layer of green pigment covered with a transparent film, more or less thick, of brown. This new technique of glazing, derived too from Flemish models, is productive of the unprecedented depth of the color in the St. Francis and its vibrant luminosity. With these methods the portrayal of the diffusion of light could become a major pictorial theme. In the Frick panel the encyclopaedic variety of nature is controlled by a broad, salient geometric structure, clear evidence of a Tuscan and central Italian inheritance. Bellini's art at this moment combines then essential qualities of the two great traditions of fifteenth-century Europe, the Flemish and the Tuscan. It becomes a sort of summa of Quattrocento pictorial experience. This is for Bellini the time of greatest assimila- tion and receptivity, but there is of course already much in his art that is altogether fresh and personal. In the work of none of his predecessors, particularly his Italian predecessors, is there a comparable union of figure and landscape. This aspect of Bellini's painting is clearly disclosed by comparison with the composition that most closely approaches it, and which may have served as a model - Mantegna's Agony in the Garden in Tours, painted between 1456 and 1459 for the predella of the S. Zeno, Verona, altarpiece (Fig. 4). The theme of Mantegna's panel is similar, involving a figure in a landscape engaged in supernatural colloquy, and the design is closely related. The figure appears at the right, gazing tensely upward with open mouth. Beyond him is a great mass of rock, while the ground immediately behind him declines in a long slope towards the left frame of the picture. Above and beyond this declining plane rises a hill. It is crossed by roads, (3) F. Kimball and L. Venturi, Great Paintings in Ame- rica, New York, 1948, p. 58; also the Catalogue of the Frick Collection, Pittsburgh, I, 1949, pp. 238-241.

FRANCIS I3 it has a town on its flank, and it is crowned by a castle. In the left foreground of the two compositions stands a large tree (9), and nearby in both water gushes from a carved stone spout. Despite the sheer rockiness of Mantegna's landscape in the region occupied by the figures, nature is not entirely hostile to them. It offers small fruits. It casts up for Christ a sort of primitive altar. It provides for one apostle who sleeps a conveniently inclined, though uncomfort- ably hard, natural cot, and it gives indomitable St. Peter a stony pillow. Thus Mantegna's world, though severe, makes concessions to its inhabitants, assuming here and there, by a strange ambiguous process, the shape of constructed objects. For this reason no doubt its inhabitants do not find it altogether uncongenial. They also seem to feel the familiarity with stone, or even the affection for it, that are so important a part of the Italian cultural heritage. At the outset of his career Giovanni Bellini's conception of nature was much influenced by Mantegna's, but for him the world was always gentler and more responsive to the people in it; and around the time of painting the Frick panel he had largely resolved Mantegna's ambiguity of the natural and the artificial, replacing it by a close, fruitful association of the two. St. Francis stands in a sort of elementary amphitheatre, partly natural and partly man-made. Behind him there is a low, curving wall. Whether the stones in it were once cut by hand or simply found in the rocky environs, they were certainly laid up manually in this wall. The builder, perhaps the saint himself, has filled with earth the pocket between the wall and the crag (Fig. 5). Mullein, juniper, and oris root grow luxuriantly in this earth, kept moist, it would seem, by water carried from the spring in the sainťs jug (10). At the left the wall merges with a fault in the rock that tends to prolong its curve to the edge of the cliff. This joining of the natural and the artificial is apparent also in the sort of little hedgerow that discreetly screens the saint and his habitation from the world beyond. For most of its length it consists of brambles that seem to flourish naturally in this arid place. But at the extreme left it is terminated by a regular row of shoots that, though apparently springing from the roots of the laurel tree, seem expressly pruned, if not indeed planted, to complete the fence. Similarly the slender willow branches, all of one size, that have been cut and woven to form a gate to the saint's cell have burst into life again and sprout leaves. Just behind the saint the massive vertical rock seems to melt in accommodation, forming a natural spreading niche that repeats the shape of his figure. In front of him the rocks take on a sort of tidal character, ebbing and flowing as though they were impelled by the depth of his experience. These swirling rocks, along with the laurel tree at the left, which is in the line of the saint's gaze, are conspicuous as agitated objects in an otherwise marvellously still world. While these objects in front respond to the excitement of the saint, it is his strength and majesty that are expressed by the crag behind. This crag is divided into three vertical masses, and the profile of the central one repeats the curving profile of the saint. The central mass, moreover, is not blue"green like the others; a pinkish light falls on it, very much as on the buff habit of the saint. In the distance, in the town, the figure of St. Francis is echoed by the free-standing, sunlit towers. The landscape is composed of three quite distinct parts : a rocky, cool blue-green foreground, a green grassy middle ground, and a warm yellow- brown distance, overhung by an intense - now almost too intense - blue sky. The composition is similar, as we have said, to Mantegna's Agony in Tours, but in one respect it is utterly different. Both the near and distant hills slope in the same direction, so that the design is decisively asymmetrical (al). Indeed the asymmetry and the compositional movement are such that without the figure of the saint, relatively small though it is, the design is rather unsatisfactory. The figure is vital to the balance and coherence of the composition as a whole, and it is effective not so much as shape or color but as actor. Most (®) In Mantegna's version of the Agony in London, which Bellini certainly knew, this tree stands at the left margin. ("O I am deeply indebted to Mr. Edward J. Alexander, associate curator of the New York Botanical Garden, for iden- tifying the plants in Bellini's picture. He recognized almost all of them immediately, so accurate is Bellini's portrayal.

FRANCIS important of all is the glance, directed towards the upper left corner of the picture with such intensity that it balances all the opposing diago- nals of the design. It is strengthened by the orthogonals of the trellis and the lectern and, still more, by the location of the vanishing point in the upper left margin of the painting, near the prominent curve in the trunk of the tree. Bellini's asymmetrical composition, moving from lower left to a large mass higher on the right, inaugurates in Venice a tradition that leads to Titian's Pesaro Madonna (Fig. 3). It probably has its roots in the most conspicuous earlier example of a design of this sort, Piero della Francesca's fresco in the Tempio Malatestiano, and it reminds us that only a short time before the painting of this picture Bellini had made a trip to Pesaro that almost certainly took him through Rimini. It was around 1473-1475, according to recent opinion (12), that Bellini painted the Coronation of the Virgin for S. Francesco, Pesaro (Fig. 6), and even if - as seems unlikely - he painted this huge altarpiece in Venice, he must have visited Pesaro before the work was finished. The rock of Gradara in that city appears in the background of the Coronation (13), and several specific sites or buildings visible along the way from Venice are represented in paintings made during the next five to ten years. The Ponte d'Augusto in Rimini appears in the St. Jerome in the Contini Collection (Fig. 15) (14), and the monuments of nearby Ravenna are visible in the landscapes of the St. Jerome and the Naples Transfiguration (Fig. 13). The church of S. Vitale may be seen in the Contini panel, and the mausoleum of Theodoric at Ravenna and the campanile of S. Apollinare in Classe in the Transfiguration ("). We do not know whether at this time the painter visited also towns on the other side of the mountains such as Borgo Sansepolcro, Arezzo, and Florence, but the Frick picture shows relationships with paintings in those places. The beautiful gesture of St. Francis, first of all, is essentially novel in Venice (16), though it is preceded by a lowering of the open hands in Giambono's Stigmatization in the Kress Collection (Fig. 7). The pantomime of Bellini's figure is familiar, however, in the work of Piero della Francesca. One of the members of the Confraternity of Mercy kneeling before the Madonna in the Borgo San- sepolcro altarpiece extends his arms similarly, and so does the youth who is revived when the true cross is held over him in the fresco in San Francesco, Arezzo (Fig. 8). Both these figures, though they lack the intensity of Bellini's saint, look upward with a similar religious venera- tion (17). In addition to Bellini two other admirers of the art of Piero adopted this broad expressive gesture. Bartolommeo della Gatta employed it for St. Francis in his freshly conceived and, as always, touching panel of the Stigmatization at Castiglion Fiorentino, for which he received a final payment in 1487 (Fig. 9)- The hands are so similar to Bellini's, even in detail, that we begin to speculate whether Bartolommeo, what- ever he owed Piero, could have known the Frick panel. Such speculation is not checked when we notice the folded cuff of Bartolommeo's saint, so characteristic of Bellini's tunics; nor when we observe in the environment the rounded mound on which the saint stands, the rocks and a cave, the live shoot growing from the cut tree-stump behind the saint, and the two animals (deer ?) on the grassy plateau beyond. Another master, Anto- nello da Messina, who was studying the work of Piero della Francesca around the same time as Bellini - the two might even have met before one of his pictures ' adopted the gesture for a St. John seated below the cross in a panel painted in 1475, no doubt in Venice (Fig. 10). Antonello and Giam- (12) The opinions of various critics about the date of this work are summarized by R. PALLUCCHINI, Catalogo della Mostra di Giovanni Bellini, Venice, 1949, p. 113. (13) G. GRONAU, Giovanni Bellini, Berlin, 1930, p. 203. (14) Hendy, op. cit., pl. 44. (15) PALLUCCHINI, op. cit., p. 140; R. Fry, Giovanni Bel- Uni, London, 1899, p. 27. (16) The right hand of Bellini's St. Francis is anticipated by the right hand of his Redeemer (standing Man of Sorrows) in the National Gallery, London. (17) The pantomime of all those figures, which includes an upward glance and the head turned back, is appreciably different from the demonstrative gesture of the Man of Sorrows with extended arms that appeared around 1360 (Meiss, Vain- ting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death, Princeton, 1951, p. 124) and that may be found later in Mantegna's panel in Copenhagen. A gesture like Bellini's and Piero's with a similar meaning of submission and acceptance was given by Poussin to the Virgin in his late Annunciation in the National Gallery, London.</page><page sequence="6">Meiss - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS I5 bellino gave much to each other, and we cannot exclude the possibility that it was in this process of exchange that the gesture passed from one to the other. In any event, Bellini looked intently at this very Crucifixion by Antonello, for its broad planes, its quiet symmetry, and its classical balance are recaptured in his picture of the same subject now in the Corsini Collection in Florence (18). And Antonello's jewel-like skulls and bones strewn on the arid ground reappear in Bellini's somewhat later Crucifixion in the Nicolini Collec- tion in Florence (19). As Roberto Longhi saw clearly many years ago (20), the Pesaro altarpiece (Fig. 6) represents a major turning point in Bellini's development. In it his struggle for an art of color guided and greatly advanced by the example of the Nether- landers and Piero della Francesca. To Piero he owes the coloristic geometry of the design and even perhaps the figure of Christ, so similar in certain respects to S. Sigismondo in the Riminese fresco. But it was not the art of Piero alone, I think, that Bellini studied in this new environ- ment. When designing the Coronation he rejected decisively the pageantry that had distinguished Venetian representations of the event from the time of Guariento's fresco for the Ducal Palace (21). Instead of the splendid assemblies of Jacobello or Antonio Vivarini or Giambono (22) Bellini created a simple and sober composition that recalls the Tuscan tradition from the early Trecento through, say, Giovanni di Paolo's panel in the Lehman Collection (23). Though no Tuscan ex- amples limit the witnesses to as few as four, they characteristically show the throne set directly upon the floor, whereas in Venice it is set high amidst the throng of witnesses (24). In the Venetian scenes, furthermore, God the Father usually presi- des, seated between and above Christ and the Vir- gin. And even in some smaller Venetian pictures of the subject where these features are lacking Christ and the Virgin are seated before a rich cloth of honor rather than before the back of a throne (2S). Hints of a study of Tuscan style are offered also by the predella: by the Nativity, first of all, which shows a plateau-valley type of composi- tion that, though used by Piero for other subjects, including the St. Jerome that may even have been visible then in Venice, appears in Nativities by Baldovinetti and other Florentine masters (26). The Conversion of St. Paul, an active, even violent, design very exceptional in the work of Bellini may imply a cursory study of Florentine experiments with rearing horses that extend from Uccello to Antonio Poliamolo (27). And does not that strange device of opening the throne upon a landscape - a landscape marvellously painted but, we must admit, greatly distracting - remind us of such Tuscan framed views as in Fra Filippo's Uffizi Madonna (Fig. 11) ? This Madonna resembles a relief sculpture, and, as in the Coronation, we have the impression that the marble background has been removed to open a window onto nature. The Pesaro altarpiece, and therefore also Bel- lini's journey south, are generally dated in the years 1473 to 1475. The painting in the Frick Collection has always been placed later than that and there is, in fact, common agreement that it was made between 1479 and 1485, after the Re- surrection in Berlin (probably finished ca. 1479 - (18) Catalogo della Mostra, cit., fig. on p. 133.

(24) Already in the fourteenth century in Venice the throne is placed above the sun and moon, and enveloped by a man- dorla - symbols that do not appear in Tuscany (cf. MEISS, op. cit., p. 44). Longhi observed Bellini's rejection of the Venetian com- positional tradition of the Coronation and suggested that he followed instead a lost Coronation by Piero or Melozzo that is reflected in Palmezzano's panel in the Brera (A. Venturi, Storia dell'Arte, Milan, VII, part. 2, 1913, fig. 56). Palmez- zano's panel was made only at the end of the century, and provides scanty support for the hypothesis that such a Pieroan prototype ever existed. If however the Coronation was represented in the central panel of Piero's S. Agostino altarpiece (as M. d'Ancona has argued in the Catalogue of the Frick Collection) Bellini might have found his model in Borgo Sansepolcro. (M) Cfr. the Vivarinesque representations in the Palazzo Comunale, Osimo (L. TESTI, Storia della Pittura Veneziana, II, 1915, fig. on p. 392) and in the National Gallery, Washington (Book of Illustrations, Washington, 1941, p. 204). God the Father may appear in small Venetian panels too, as for instance the Vivarini school work in the Museo Civico, Turin (Testi, op. cit., II, p. 377). (26) For the plateau composition see Meiss in Venezia e l'Europa, Atti del XV III Congresso Internazionale di Storia dell'Arte, Venice, 1956, pp. 64 fř. (27) The scene of the Martyrdom of Peter also exhibits exceptional activity. The equestrian group of St. George in the Pesaro predella is likewise not adequately accounted for by the precedent of Jacopo Bellini.</page><page sequence="7">16 Meiss - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS Fig. 12) (2S) and even after - or some believe, just before - the Transfiguration in Naples (Fig. 1 3) (29). This sequence of the painter's major works after 1475 seems to me to imply a rather erratic growth during the years of crucial change. But no artist of the Quattrocento actually developed as steadily as Bellini. His stylistic poise was unique, and it was maintained during some sixty years of incessant change that brought his art from the Mantegnesque virtually into the High Renaissance. He alone in Italy encompassed such an evolution. New qualities, once acquired, were never relin- quished, and the line of pictorial advance in the works under consideration surely extends from the Resurrection (Fig. 12) to the Transfiguration (Fig. 1 3) to the S. Giobbe altarpiece, with the St. Francis painted at the outset. Though reminiscences of Mantegna are visible in all these works (30), the Francis is the most deeply Mantegnesque. It is the most linear. The edges of forms are salient not only in the rocks of the foreground but in the distant landscape as well. Alongside these hills the hills of the Resurrection look soft, fluffy, pictu* resque - islands of color that begin to glow in the light rather than some denser substance carved, it would seem, into lively relief. True, the execution of the Resurrection, in which the participation of assistants is especially evident, may have extended over several years, so that it was in part contem- porary with the St. Francis. In any event some forms are similar to the Frick panel or even « older » looking - the tree at the left, the large shield, and perhaps also the astonishing floating cloth of Christ, no doubt a consequence of Belli- ni's admiration of a picture by Roger van der Wey- den, seen probably when passing through Ferra- ra (31). The figures in the Resurrection, on the other hand, are broader than the St. Francis and emanate from a new, more coloristic vision. This newer vision is developed further in the Transfiguration. Here the distinction between fore- ground, middleground and distance, so decisively preserved in the Frick panel and, to a lesser extent, in the Resurrection, has given way to a more direct extension inward through a complex series of intersecting planes. The objects, as well as the patches of light and shade, are scattered more freely through the space, greatly enhancing the picturesqueness of the whole. Alongside this paint- ing and the Resurrection, indeed alongside any other work of Bellini, the Frick panel is distinguish- ed by its prominent geometric structure. In no other work are the shapes so firmly organized by repeated diagonals, horizontals, and verticals. The pattern of color is similarly conceived, progress- ing regularly from cool in the foreground to very warm in the distance - from blue, in other words, through green to yellow - and red-brown. Then the near blue, which is continued upward in the rocks, is repeated, but with greater intensity, in the sky, completing on three sides a frame of blue for the more varied colors within. While the linearity of this compositional organi- zation reflects the conventions of Mantegna, its bold, firm geometricky would seem to be another consequence of that study of Piero and of Flor- entine painting which, as we have already suggest- ed, Bellini undertook during his trip southward (32). This sequence of paintings would bring the St. Francis close to the Coronation, and indeed it has much in common with this altarpiece, « archi- tettato con una grandiosità monumentale », as Pal" lucchini has described it (33). The little landscape picture in this work is, moreover, remarkably like (28) This seems to be the painting that once was in the chapel of Marco Zorsi in S. Michele, Murano - a chapel built in 1475 and dedicated to the Resurrection in a notice of 1479 (cf. G. Ludwig and W. Bode, in Jahrbuch der preussischen Kunstsammlungen, XXIV, 1903, p. 131). (*®) Berenson, Venetian Painting in America, pp. 95-105, dates the Pesaro altarpiece ca. 1475, the Transfiguration ca. 1480, the Resurrection around the same time or a little later, and then the Frick St. Francis just before the S. Giobbe altar- piece. L. DUSSLER, loc. cit., dates the Frick picture about 1480, at the same time as the Transfiguration. The chronology of Hendy, op. cit., p. 20 ff., is : Pesaro Coronation, Resurrection (1475), S. Giobbe altarpiece, Earthly Paradise, Transfiguration, and St. Francis. LONGHl'S most recent order ( Burlington Ma- gazine, XCI, 1949, pp. 281-2) is: Pesaro ca. 1473, Resurrection (ca. 1479), St. Francis, Contini St. Jerome, Transfiguration. i30) See especially the immediate foreground of the T ransfiguration. m V. C. Habicht in Belvedere, X, 1931, p. 54 ff., has already proposed that Bellini adopted two of Roger's figures. The Virgin in the Nativity of the Carità altarpiece was taken, he says, from a Rogerian model (not specified), and the Magdalen in the Pesaro Crucifixion from the Magdalen in Roger's Lamentation. The first observation is not convincing, the second very sound, but I have the most serious doubts about Bellini's authorship of this Crucifixion. (32) Bellini already had opportunities in Venice itself for the study of specimens of the work of Fra Filippo, Uccello, and Castagno (whose mosaic in the Mascoli Chapel must have had an eifert on him during the 'seventies). i33) Catalogo cit., p. 110</page><page sequence="8">Meiss - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS yj the one framed by the rocks in the Frick panel. The similarity between the two Saints Francis is equally great. The date of execution of the Coro- nation, generally held to be ca. 1473-75, may be advanced towards 1470-71 if the hypothesis we shall advance below is correct. The sequence of Bellini's major paintings during this period would seem to be, then, the Coronation, the St. "Francis somewhat later in the 'seventies, the Resurrection finished by 1479, and the Transfiguration in the early eighties, followed soon afterward by the S. Giobbe altarpiece. Another large panel belonging to this group, the St. Jerome in the Contini Col- lection, may be placed ca. 1480 (Fig. 15), while the newly discovered Descent into Umbo in Bristol is closely related to the St. Francis (34). Many of the rocks and the plants of the St. Francis appear in it also. II In its most exceptional aspect - a lone figure embraced by an extended landscape - the Frick panel recalls the representations of another saint that first became popular in the Quattrocento - St. Jerome in the « wilderness ». No other subject exemplifies more vividly the emergence within a religious context of the early Renaissance curiosity about the natural world and delight in its varied beauty. Most of the paintings of this theme are small, produced for private contemplation, and they offered to the sophisticated urban collectors models of a tranquil life led apart from society in an orderly, bounteous suburb. Thus they antici- pate the pastoral idyll that becomes prominent in literature of the sixteenth century. The theme of St. Jerome, which brings man, animals and nature so intimately together, was favored especially in Venice, becoming a Venetian theme par excellen- ce (35). Giovanni Bellini himself is chiefly respons- ible for its special development there. With his workshop he painted the subject no less than four times. He made first the charming small panel in the Barber Institute, Birmingham (Fig. 14) (S6), then the beautiful silvery predella of the Pesaro altarpiece (37), the large picture in the Contini Collection (Fig. 15), and the panel in the National Gallery, Washington, in that order (38). Finally, near the age of 80 in 1513, when painting for S. Giovanni Crisostomo, he returned to the subject once again, permitting it to invade the upper space of an altarpiece given over to formal cult images (39). These paintings of St. Jerome by Bel- lini share with the St. Francis broad aspects of theme and design and landscape. In them Bellini makes a characteristic innovation: to the rocky « desert » traditionally associated with the saint and still visible in the work of his father Jacopo, he adds, already in the very early Birmingham picture, a peaceful pastoral countryside. This grows in scope and gradually usurps the place of the « wilderness ». All these paintings share, too, similar wild and domesticated creatures. Predatory animals, such as the dragons, jackals, and serpents with which Jacopo Bellini surrounded St. Jerome (40), have no place in Giovanni's benign world. In his very early Birmingham panel a rabbit, frequent denizen of late medieval and early Renaissance landscapes, in- cluding Mantegna's (41), emerges from his hole with a quizzical expression much like that of the i34) J. Byam Shaw, « A Giovanni Bellini at Bristol », in Burlington Magazine, XCIV, 1952, p. 157. Shaw dates the painting ca. 1473. The fact that the painting (which I have not seen) is a copy after Mantegna, even down to the drapery pattern of Christ, should not conceal the similarity of its style to the St. Francis. In some of the paintings of this group - the Resurrection and the St. Jerome - the share of the workshop seems to have been larger than in others. The Resurrection, furthermore, is not in good condition. The common tendency to date the Frick panel too late may have been due, at least in part, to the heavy yellow varnish that covered it until it was cleaned in 1942. i35) But it is not by any means exclusively Venetian. See for instance the panel in Sao Paulo attributed incorrectly to Mantegna (BERENSON, Vedere e Sapere , Milan, n. d., pl. 55), or the several representations by Marco Zoppo. For observations on representations of St. Jerome in the Quattrocento cf. Hartt, op. cit., p. 34. It is very unlikely, however, that, as Hartt says, the Venetian and Bellinesque compositions derive from Piero's panel now in the Accademia. They stem rather from a north Italian tradition represented by, for instance, Pisanello's panel in the National Gallery, London. i36) Cf.

FRANCIS rabbit in the Frick painting. In the field behind a horse is grazing, perhaps the « ass » guarded by Jerome's lion, according to the legend (42). There are rabbits as well as birds, including a heron, in Carlo Crivelli's painting oř St. Jerome in the Na- tional Gallery, London. Here again a horse - or is it a deer ? - stands nearby (Fig. 16). A squirrel, some birds and a deer inhabit the landscape of Bellini's St. Jerome in the Contini Collection (Fig. 15), and similar creatures may be seen in a St. Jerome attributed to Cima in Harewood House (43). The « wilderness » of St. John the Baptist contains similar inhabitants. A heron meditates alongside the saint in Garofalo's picture in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (Fig. 17), possibly contem- plating the extraordinary congregation nearby, consisting of a wild boar, an ostrich, a lion, two rabbits and a very sentimental bear. The animals in the Frick panel are, then, the familiar companions of saints who live alone, apart from society. There are other familiar elements of the environment of such saints. The bell may be seen in, for instance, two paintings of St. Jerome by or close to Ercole de' Roberti ("). Jerome is commonly barefoot, while his sandals are often displayed nearby (45), and a simple wooden cross is stuck into the ground. In Bellini's St. Jerome in the Contini Collection, the cross is like the one in the Frick St. Francis (46). Crivelli's St. Jerome in London includes, in a rustic cell, a table (but not a lectern) and some books (Fig. 16). The skull in the Frick picture is something of an innovation. As a symbol of mortality and an instrument of penitential contemplation it was introduced into representations of St. Jerome, as Janson has shown, in the *seventies(47), and its connection with St. Francis actually seems to begin in the Frick pa- nel (48). It is a commonplace of later representations of the saint, whether devotional or historical (Stig" matization) (49). In the light of all these relationships we might well conclude that the painting in the Frick Col- lection simply represents St. Francis, like St. Jero- me, « in the wilderness ». This is precisely the title given it a few years after Bellini's death, for it was very probably the Frick painting that Marcantonio Michiel saw in 1525 in the house of Taddeo Contarini in Venice and which he described as follows: « La tavola del S. Francesco nel deserto fu opera de Zuan Bellino cominciata da lui a M. Zuan Michel, e ha un paese propinquo finito e ricercato mirabilmente ». (The panel of St. Francis in the wilderness was the work of Giovanni Bellini, begun by him for Messer Zuan Michel; and it has a landscape close by, admirably studied and worked out) (50). This succinct description gives little comfort to the secularists who claim that in its time the painting was understood as pure landscape, for Michiel identifies the religious subject first and refers to the landscape last, after recording the name of the painter and his client. In any event, the authority of an early opinion may be invoked (42) As Eugene Carroll kindly suggested to me. See the Golden Legend, s.v. Jerome (Sept. 30), and G. Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in Tuscan Tainting, Florence, 1952, p. 530 and fig. 608. (43) A. VENTURI, Storia dell'Arte Italiana, Milan, VII, part. 4, fig. 313. If the representations of St. Jerome influenced the Frick St. Francis, it is also possible that the latter influenced at least one representation of the former: the picture by Veronese in the Art Institute, Chicago. In this painting there appear similarly disposed rocks and a tree, a lectern with a skull, a shepherd with his flock, and a city in the background. (44) In the Barlow Collection (G.

Mr. Berenson, construing « propinquo » as an adverb, believed the phrase meant « almost finished » («pro- pinquo finito ») by Bellini, and he attributed part of the landscape to another painter ( Venetian Fainting in America, p. 104), but these views are certainly incorrect, and he appears to have abandoned them himself. L. VENTURI, Italian Fainting in America, New York, 1933, no. 390, construes « propinquo » as « in the foreground ». This passage provides an early instance of the appearance of the concept of landscape («paese»). On the history of this see E. H. Gombrich, « Renaissance Artistic Theory and the Development of Landscape Painting », in Gazette des Beaux Arts, XLI, 1953, p. 335 ff.</page><page sequence="10">Meiss - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS ļc&gt; to support what seems the simplest solution of the problem of interpretation. This solution however presents serious difficulties. There was, first of all, no tradition for the representation of St. Francis in the wilderness, whether praying, communing, or simply existing, and Bellini's painting, so far as I know, did not inaugurate one. It was only in the late sixteenth century that painters began to represent St. Francis out-of-doors in a state of religious ecstasy ("). It is true that in the central panel of his Borgo Sansepolcro altarpiece Sassetta, following Taddeo di Bartolo, had painted St. Francis « in glory », his arms outstretched and his eyes turned to heaven (52). This beautiful painting may even have been seen by Bellini, but in it the rapture occurs within the formal composition of a didactic cult image. The saint, placed frontally, tramples on personifications of the three great Franciscan vices. As an ecstatic St. Francis in a extended landscape, Bellini's painting would thus seem to be both unprecedented and unique until a much later time. If then the Frick picture does not seem to portray the saint simply in a certain state of mind, it must represent a known experience in his life. But which ? The small sheet of paper slipped below his girdle together with the fact that he addresses the heavens might suggest that he is engaged in composing, perhaps the Hymn to the Sun. The attitude of the saint is however distinctly receptive rather than creative. Furthermore in all medieval and Renaissance art no such scene of poetic creation was ever portrayed, and, if it were, the saint would not appear in a mountain wilder- ness but seated in a hut near the monastery of S. Damiano, where the legends say the poem was composed ("). What then of the Stigmatization itself ? While the landscape and the posture of the saint suggest it in a general way, several aspects of the «ad- ditional representation are lacking. Neither Brother Leo nor the little chapel is represented. St. Francis is standing rather than kneeling, and he does not raise his arms and hands in the familiar manner. The wounds are not conspicuous; indeed two of them, one in a foot and the other in his side, are not visible at all. Most important of all, the seraph, central symbol of the event, fails to appear in the heavens. There are, it is true, representations of the Stigmatization that resemble Bellini's picture in one or another of these respects, but in no one work are all these unusual features combined. The wound in the side is lacking in almost all the very early representations (M), and likewise in those in which the saint faces towards the left, as in the Frick panel (Fig. 1) ("). Neither Tommaso da Ce- lano nor Bonaventura say that Francis was kneel- ing at the time of the Stigmatization, and the saint is occasionally shown standing in Northern paint- ings of the Stigmatization (56) and in Italian, as in a panel by Macrino d'Alba ("). Sometimes he assumes a position between standing and kneeling, notably in a Mantegnesque panel in the Gardner Museum, Boston, which seems curiously to antici- pate some qualities of Ercole de' Roberti (Fig. 18) (58). In Bartolommeo della Gatta this unstable posture, as we have seen, is combined with Bel- lini's gesture and other elements of Bellini's com- position (Fig. 9), so that we come close to possess- ing a painter's judgment in the 'eighties that the Frick panel represented the Stigmatization. In a few other paintings too, one of which is earlier than the Frick panel (Fig. 7), the conventional position of the hands is replaced by a gesture (51) Sometimes St. Francis, like St. Jerome, kneels before a book and a crucifix, with a skull alongside, but his hands are clasped in prayer (see Cigoli, Corsini and Borghese Gal- leries, Rome, and L. Carracci, Museo Capitolino). Often the saint flings his arms wide in ecstacy (painting attributed to Annibale Carracci, Museo Capitolino). (52) Collection of B. Berenson. Cf. J.

FRANCIS that resembles more or less the one in the Frick panel (59). And the rustic cell is occasionally intro- duced, particularly in one painting that follows closely the text of the Sacre Sante Stimmate (60). Apart from Bartolommeo della Gatta's possible testimony, the unusual representations of the Stigmatization do no more than tell us that Bel- lini's picture might conceivably be one. We would therefore remain uncertain were not other aspects of the work more compelling. The rocky setting, first of all, suggests La Verna, the mountain to which St. Francis retired shortly before the super- natural experience. As Dante described it: « nel crudo sasso intra Tevere ed Arno da Cristo prese l'ultimo sigillo » (61) Whereas Bellini's contemporaries in Florence, such as Domenico Ghirlandaio, portrayed this site in the distance and in much smaller scale than the saint in the foreground (Fig. 19), Giovanni in characteristic manner set the figure immediately below the crag. Furthermore the rocks that he painted show _ as Howard Davis has kindly pointed out to me - a remarkable resemblance to actual masses at La Verna (Fig. 20). The site itself was not distant from Bellini's presumed route to or from Pesaro, and if he went to Borgo and Arezzo, it lay quite near. We must moreover recall that the Frick painting was made during a period just after this trip when the painter was incorporating in his pictures monuments he had seen along the way. Ghirlandaio's fresco is instructive in other ways too (Fig. 19). It shows that even in Florentine painting, where one would least expect them, wild animals inhabited the landscape of the Stigmati- zation. Already in Sienese painting of the thirteenth century, indeed, a few birds and mammals - often a bear - shared the countryside with Francis (Fig. 21) (62). Two deer are prominent in Ghirlandaio's painting, and again (are they actually deer ?) in Bartolommeo della Gatta's (Fig. 9). There is a deer also in a Stigmatization by Jacopo Bellini and by Michele Giambono (Fig. 7) (63). In the latter the relationship of the stag to the scene as a whole is much the same as that of the donkey in Bellini's picture. The kinds of animals and birds that inhabit the landscapes of the Stigmatization vary as much as those that appear alongside St. Jerome or the Baptist, so that they seem to be present as repre- sentatives of the wild creatures that accompany holy hermits and as manifestations of the Quattro- cento love of the natural world. Whether in ad- dition to these two categories of meaning they are endowed with a third and indeed a fourth-whether, in other words, as specific creatures they are con- nected with objects and events in the legend of the saint, and also symbolize more general religious concepts is, as often, difficult to say. Perhaps we may recognize in the rabbit the leveret that St. Francis protected (64). The ass is possibly the one that carried the saint up Mount Alverna (65). Still, when proposing so specific an identity we must remember not only the stag in a similar position in other portrayals of the theme but also the nearly identical ass, again standing quietly and alone, in a dooryard in the Nicolini Crucifixion (66) and in the woods in the Bellinesque Martyrdom of St. Peter Martyr in London (67). Perhaps the spring, which we have seen in Mantegna's Agony in the Garden in Tours and in other paintings as a sort of fons vitae, alludes to the spring described in the Sacre Sante Stimmate , though that was not at the actual site of the Stigmatization. But even after we have pointed to the legend of the saint, it is conceivable (I do not say prob- able) that we have not exhausted the more im- portant meanings of the forms in the painting. In medieval thought the ass, for instance, can symbolize, in addition to many evil qualities, the people whom Christ leads to the heavenly king- i59) The painting by Giambono was published by R.

FRANCIS 21 dom (68). The blue heron in Bellini's picture, which corresponds to the fowl in Giambono's (Fig. 7), can refer to the souls of the elect (69) or to ideas of righteousness (70) or penitence (71). Such mean- ings can be attributed of course not only to the living creatures in the picture but to the plants also. The grape vine commonly signifies Christ's sacrifice, but then it usually bears fruit, as in Man- tegna's Agony in Tours (Fig. 4), which Bellini certainly knew, so that its lack of grapes in the Frick panel is almost pointed (72). The other plants may all be found in paintings by Bellini of a variety of subjects. The brambles appear again in the Contini Jerome (Fig. 15), and in it as well as the St. Jerome in Washington we may see an ivy vine and a fig tree. Ivy twines around a stump in the Naples Transfiguration (Fig. 13). Recently Klauner has pointed to the presence of ivy and fig in other paintings by Bellini - the Man of Sorrows in Stockholm and the Descent into Limbo in Bristol - as well as in compositions by many other masters of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, particularly of the Venetian region, and she has concluded that these plants are connected in meaning with a sequence of more or less related things and ideas, ranging from the tree of know- ledge to the virtues of the saints and the birth and passion of Christ (73). The prominent, lively tree in Bellini's painting poses for us a more urgent, though no more sol- uble, problem of interpretation. In many earlier representations of the Stigmatization the saint stands before a cave (74), and near him a tree seems to curl and twist in response to the intensity of his experience (Fig. 21) (75). The portrayal of an active tree seems to be rooted in the tradition of the subject. In the Frick panel the three may be an olive, symbol of concord, peace, and divine love, or a laurus nobīlis, whose very name sug- gests the values that it symbolized in the Middle Ages. Inasmuch as the laurel was believed to be resistant to fire, it designated enduring, indestruct- ible virtues. In his Reductorium Morale Berchorius compared it with the cross, which kept mankind from the fire of eternal damnation (76). Dealing with the story of Apollo and Daphne in his moralized Ovid, he said that the laurel signifies the crucifix, and that Apollo embraced the laurel tree as Christ the cross (77). The applicability to St. Francis is obvious. This text of the mid- fourteenth century certainly circulated in north Italy (78), but whether Bellini or someone in his circle was familar with it we cannot say. It is difficult to know whether the painter invested the objects in his picture with any of the meanings we have just discussed. Lacking specifically relevant texts, we can only evaluate the probabilities in the light of late Quattrocento painting in general, and Bellini's work, especially of this period, in particular. The exercise of these historical methods, « tempered, if possible, by com- mon sense » (to use Erwin Panofsky's unforgetta- ble phrase) (79), leaves the question undecided. In a panel painted by Bellini not long before the Frick picture, the Man of Sorrows in London, one of the reliefs behind Christ represents a pagan O See Rabanus MAURUS, in Migne, Patr. lat., vol. Ill, col. 212. (69) Ibid., col. 246. (TO) The heron shuns carrion as the righteous the corrupt world. See E. P. EVANS, Animal Symbolism in Ecclesiastical Architecture, London, 1896. p. 148.

Klauner, « Zur Symbolik von Giorgiones drei Philosophen », in Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlun- gen, LI, 1955, p. 147 ff. Mantegna introduced the plants in, for example, the Agony in London, the St. Sebastian in the Louvre, and the Adoration of the Magi in the Uffizi. The fig alone appears in the Pesaro Nativity. Observing that it is most often represented in the Venetian region (Padua and Mantegna included), Klauner suggests that it, together with the cave in the Nativity, was an iconographie importation from the East after the fall of Constantinople, a rather dubious view. (74) For instance, in the Psalter of Isabelle of France (ed. S.C. Cockerell, London, 1905, pl. XVI) and Taddeo Gaddi's panel in the Accademia, Florence (see F. J. MATHER, Jr. in Art Studies, VIII, 1931, fig. 5). (76) F. Hartt, loc. cit., suggested that the movement of the tree in the Frick panel conveys a supernatural intervention. (78) BERCHORIUS, Reductorium Morale, Cologne, 1730, I, pp. 495-496 (Bk. XII, chap. 84). The anthropomorphic tree in Mantegna's late painting in the Louvre symbolizes « virtus deserta ». The laurel was commonly connected with poetry, as in BOCCACCIO'S Life of Dante (trans, by J. R. Smith, New York 1901, p. 56). A similar tree appears at the left margin of Bellini's Crucifixion in the Nicolini Collection.

FRANCIS sacrifice, which his hand blots out, and the land- scape behind seems differentiated or « moraliz- ed » (80). On Christ's left the structures are ruinous, and the large tree on the hill is bare of leaves. On his right the light is brighter, the world warmer, the buildings intact. In many other paint- ings however Bellini seems to ignore such connota- tions. In the Pesaro St. Jerome, for instance, some verdant trees are visible in the distance while a large dead tree, conspicuously rotting but indubi- tably picturesque, rises alongside the saint. There is a similar specimen on the Virgin's right in the Assumption in S. Pietro Martire, Murano (81). Furthermore, in both the Transfiguration in Naples (Fig. 13) and the late Pietà in the Academy (82) a prominent bare tree appears on Christ's right, while a leafy one may be seen at his left. A similar in3ifference at least to the symbolism of position may be observed in a panel in London, where on the Madonna's right a serpent attacks a crane (83). Ill Bellini placed the large tree, traditional in the Stigmatization, at the left margin of his painting while locating the cave at the right, and they are given the same position in a painting of the subject by the workshop of Federigo Barocci in the Uffizi (Fig. 22) (84). This spirited picture, painted about a hundred years after Bellini's work, has evidently much in common with it. So similar indeed are the two that one wonders what might be the connection between them-whether both painters had in mind the same actual site, or whether Ba- rocci had seen Bellini's picture. Barocci placed the cleft in the rock immedia- tely behind St. Francis, giving it a shape generally similar to his. Here as in numerous other paintings of the Stigmatization (Fig. 7) this form represents the depression in the rock described in the appendix to the Fioretti called Considerazioni sulle Sacre Stimmate (85). While St. Francis was living at La Verna before the Stigmatization, according to the text, he was attacked by the devil at a precipitous height. Unable to escape by any ordinary means, he was saved by a miraculous softening of the rock behind that, « like melted wax », permitted him to sink back into it. Thereafter the rock permanently retained the form of the saint. The cave at the far right in Bellini's picture, while somewhat similar in outline to the saint, serves as his cell and is provided with a gate so that is does not clearly allude to the event described in the Considerazioni. But what of the rock just behind him which, as we have already said, seems to have melted to accomodate his figure ? Barocci undoubtedly knew the Considerazioni because he put into the tree the falcon which, the text says, made a nest near the saint's cell and saw to it that he awakened early each morning for matins (86). In Barocci's picture, as in the texts, the stigmatization occurs at night, and the supernatural light emanating from the seraph falls upon the mountain. The Actus, a life of St. Francis written ca. 1325 that greatly influenced the "Fio- retti, says simply: « Et apparaît (Christus sub specie Seraph) cum tanto splendore de nocte quod illuminavit montes et valles circumquaque distinctos amplius quam si solis claritas affuisset. De quo testes fuerunt pasto- res qui per partes illas cum gregibus vigilabant ». « And at night Christ (in the form of a Seraph) appeared with such brilliance that he lighted the hills and valleys around more distinctly than if the brightness of the sun had fallen on them. Witnesses of this were some shepherds who were tending their sheep in the region » (87). The Considerazioni is more elaborate and me' lodramatic and it adds a reference to the inns in the neighborhood and to some mule-drivers: (m) See MEISS, « Light as Form and Symbol in Some Fifteenth-Century Paintings », in Art Bulletin, XXVII, 1945, pp. 175-176, and F.

Wherefore when the shepherds that were watching in that country saw the mountains aflame and so much brightness round about they were sore afraid, according as they afterwards told the friars, and affirmed that that flame had endured over the mount of La Verna for the space of an hour and more. Likewise, certain muleteers that were going to Romagna arose up at the brightness of this light which shone through the windows of the inns of that country, and thinking that the sun had risen, saddled and loaded their beasts. And as they went their way, they saw the said light wane and the real sun rise » (88). In a meadow beyond the mountain in Barocci's painting we see two men illuminated by a camp- fire in the dooryard of a building (an inn ?). One of them points out the miracle to the other (89). Beyond the miraculous radiance and the dark night the dawn breaks, touching one cloud with a rosy glow. These aspects of the Stigmatization described by the texts had occasionally been represented in art before the time of Barocci. Piero della Fran- cesca in the predella of his Perugia altarpiece had already laid the event at night (90), while other painters, though avoiding the nocturnal setting, included the incidents in the vicinity. At the extreme right in Ghirlandaio's fresco some riders have stopped their horses in midstream and are looking up at the heavens, in the general direction of the seraph (Fig. 19). One of them shields his eyes from the bright light. Behind St. Francis two friars look upward also, so that the painter has dealt freely with the account in the legends. Any doubt that the texts lie behind these actions is removed by another example of the Stigmatization in the Pinacoteca at Modena (Fig. 24). This feeble work, Florentine of the late fifteenth century, was obviously influenced by Ghirlandaio's fresco. Yet it gives a conspicuous place in the landscape to a mule-driver (or is it not perhaps a donkey- driver ?) who « as (he) went his way, saw the (strange) light wane and the real sun rise ». The same person, with a beast of burden that likewise defies precise zoological classification, looks into the heavens in Lo Spagna's fresco in the Muni- cipio, Nami (91). In the light of these texts and paintings some aspeas of Bellini's landscape immediately attract our attention. Within the town lying in the sun- light in the distance not a person or an animal is visible (Fig. 23). Unlike the towns in other works by the painter, such as the Nicolini Cruci- fixion, it is entirely empty, as it would be at night. In the green meadow stretching out before it, amidst a flock of sheep, stands a shepherd leaning on his crook and looking intently in the general direction of the saint. Now there is a similar shepherd leaning on his crook in the Resurrection, but he looks off to the right, away from the action of the painting (92). The shepherd in the Madon- na in a Meadow in London, like the one in the Frick panel, looks in the direction of the beholder, but he is lying casually in the grass (93). A shepherd relaxes similarly in the Madonna of 1510 in the i88) I Fioretti di San Francesco, ed. by F. Casolini, Milan, 1926, p. 232.

Pietro Martire, Murano (95) - another of the sleeping figures that, as I have pointed out else- where, appear in the tranquil art of the Vene- tians (96). Sometimes the shepherd drives along a flock of sheep or some cattle, as in the Transfigu- ration or the Uffizi allegory (9T). In all these paint- ings he is present as the inhabitant of a rich pro- ductive countryside, and he conveys the poetry of a life in close relation to nature. Only in the Frick panel does he seem engrossed with a religious event. Could he be one of those shepherds who, in the legends, were witnesses of the miracle of Monte Alverna ? What the shepherds saw, according to the legends, was the sudden brightness of the mountain at night, and although in the picture no nocturnal illumination of this sort seems to be portrayed, there is in one part of it a very strange luminary phenomenon. Most of the picture is lighted in a quite normal way - normal, that is, for the Quattro- cento and more particularly for Bellini in the later seventies. In works of this period, beginning with the Pesaro Coronation , space for the first time seems filled with light. In the Frick panel as in the Berlin Resurrection (Fig. 12) that shortly followed it this light seems to have a definite source, and certain prominent forms relatively near the beholder cast shadows on the ground. In the Frick panel this is true of the saint, the arbor, the lectern, and the donkey. The angle of all of these shadows is approximately the same, indicating that the source of the light is at the left just a little in front of the plane of the picture. With the exception of the donkey's these shadows are all long, and the full light penetrates to the further cross-bar of the lower part of the lectern (Fig. 5). Here and in all his early work Bellini apparently had in mind a low source of light, as though the sun were near the horizon. Consistent with this position the light is very warm. It falls full on the saint, who is turned at right angles to it. Though he looks a little above it, one has the impression that his experience is somehow bound up with it. To a degree there is nothing ununsual about this. The association of light with spirituality is as old as religion itself, and earlier in the Quat- trocento, in Fra Filippo's Vision of St. Augustine in the Uffizi, for instance, this association had been made vivid and central in pictorial representations. But whereas in Fra Filippo's painting a supernatu- ral figure may be seen within the radiance, in Bellini's work there is nothing but the light itself. No seraph is visible. X-rays of the picture do not show that one was ever planned, and although the panel was originally somewhat higher, it is unlikely that one existed in the missing section (98). Now in every period the seraph is, with the rarest exceptions, a central form in the representation of the stigmatization ("). Can we, indeed dare we then suppose that the light in Bellini's picture has an unnatural origin, that it is associated with the seraph and is, in short, that « splendor that shone and illumined all the mountains and the valleys round about, as were the sun shining on the earth ? ». The quality of the light in the painting that we have already described is not in itself unusual, but in the sky in the upper left-hand corner of the painting, deeper in space than the main source of light, there is an astonishing occurrence (Fig. 25) (10°). Not far above the horizon the clouds seem to part, revealing an intense yellow radiance. Yellow light radiates from these openings, tinging the edges of several clouds, and streaking across others. The rays disappear behind the tree, but on the other side of it the clouds are tinted yellow by them. It is clear that this luminary display is related to those earlier Quattrocento celestial phe- nomena that accompany the appearance of a super- (w) Ibid., pl. 108. (95) Ibid., pl. 99.

(98) X-rays show very few changes. The largest one involves the position of the furthermost tree that grows from the rock. The panel was undoubtedly cut at the top because there the paint extends to the very edge of the panel whereas on the other three sides it stops about Vz inch short of the edge. (") See above, p. 40. In later art the seraph was sometimes just barely visible in the radiance in the sky, as in Guercino's painting in the Pinacoteca, Cesena. It appears indistinctly between the branches and leaves of a tree in a drawing by Barocci in the Uffizi. (10°) Noticed many years ago, it seems, by Adolfo VEN- TURI, Storia dell'Arte italiana, Milan, VII part. 4, 1915, p. 310. It became much more apparent when the picture was cleaned in 1942.</page><page sequence="16">Meiss - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS 25 natural figure. These phenomena are developed especially in the Netherlands, by Roger van der Weyden (Beaune Last Judgment , Braque triptych, Baptism) and by Dirk Bouts (Fig. 26). Only a few years after Bellini another Italian painter, Fi" lippino Lippi, who was equally fascinated by Netherlandish painting, introduced a similar, though more natural « glory » into his celebrated panel of the Virgin appearing to St. Bernard, in the Badia, Florence. And Bellini's pupil, Titian, lighted the sky of his early Madonna in London (no. 635) with similar yellow rays, to suggest the miracle of the Incarnation and the appearance of the angel to the shepherds. On closer examination of Bellini's painting it becomes evident that his phenomenon, unlike the others, has no clear natural basis. The clouds are not dense, as one would expect in an occurrence of this sort. They are in fact much less dense than the cumulous ones further to the right, and they are not visible everywhere around the radiance, so that in places it is the blue sky itself that seems to open. The openings moreover are painted in a heavy impasto that is unique in the picture (101). They tend to form an arc, and the crown of the nearly tree, curling into a similar shape, seems stirred and pulled towards them as by some magnetic force. The concentration of forces in this region is increased by the location of the pictorial point of sight nearby. Does this unnatural illumination not suggest the glory around the seraph - the sort of glory that had become increas- ingly naturalistic during the Quattrocento ? Would it be a distant symbol of an unseen supernatural presence ? IV We are confronted with a mystery. Perhaps the nature of other paintings by Bellini will enable us to penetrate it, and will help us to decide whether in the Frick panel he might have taken the bold step of omitting a seraph from a stigma- tization. A few years before this work Bellini had, in fact, painted the same subject. In this panel, part of the predella of the Pesaro altarpiece (Fig. 27), all the traditional elements are included - the mountain, the seraph with a cross, the chapel (grown however to a large church), the reading friar, and even rudimentary rays that dart for a short distance from each wound. Despite these traditional forms the scene is in one respect most unusual. In early paintings of the Stigmatization the seraph hovers near the saint. During the Quat- trocento, as a consequence of the development of perspective and of the desire to differentiate more decisively between the natural and the superna- tural, the seraph often appeared deep in space, at a great distance from the saint. It was given this position in Domenico Veneziano's painting in Washington, and in a drawing in Jacopo Bellini's London « sketch book », which in this and some other respects resembles the Pesaro composi- tion (102). But in these earlier works the saint kneels in profile or turned away from the beholder, looking at a seraph that hovers more or less deep in space. Giovanni Bellini's saint on the other hand faces outwards and the tiny seraph is at first scarcely visible, so that the saint seems moved by some purely internal vision, and it is his ecstacy alone with which the beholder is confronted. The painter's desire to dwell exclusively on the spiritual experience of the saint has other consequences, too. His novel posture near front- ality entails an exceptional position for the seraph. However it may be visible to the saint, the be- holder sees it only from behind. The seraph is reversed also in Marco Zoppo's Stigmatization in the Walters Gallery, Baltimore, though its apparent size is far greater (Fig. 28). Zoppo's panel was probably painted in 1471, so that the nature of its relationship to the Pesaro predella is important for the chronology of Bellini's work. This problem is discussed in an appendix. Bellini carried the startling visual diminution of the heavenly figure further by imbedding it, so to speak, in the architecture of the great church behind. The arm of the cross is exactly parallel (101) This opaque impasto is very different from the transparent glazes used in the rest of the surface, but close inspection has stilled my thought that this difference might signify lack of authenticity. (102) The church is large and rays are omitted. Cf. V. Golubeww, op. cit., I, pl. XLVII. In a drawing in the Louvre « sketchbook », the seraph is nearer and rays are represented {ibid., II, pl. 67).</page><page sequence="17">26 Meiss - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS to the gable immediately below it, and the entire form seems at first to be attached to the roof, like some gigantic gargoyle (103). But we really cannot be sure that the seraph is near the church at all. If the glance of the saint and the rays issuing from his wounds are directed towards it, it must on the contrary hover very near the picture plane. For this place, however, it is far too small. If on the other hand it is near the church, then its back is turned to the saint as well as to the beholder. We can only conclude that the painter, concerned with the inner excitement of the saint, was quite content with the ambiguity of the. seraph's position. The relevance of this spatial ambiguity to the luminary ambiguity in the Frick panel is evident. While the Pesaro predella anticipates the painting in the Frick Collection by reducing the evidence of the supernatural and implying a more immanent religion, several other panels made by Bellini around this time manifest more clearly the new spiritual connotations of nature. The Agony in the Garden in London was painted around 1460, early in the master's career (Fig. 29). One of his greatest and, in a sense, most revolutionary works, it is concerned with a subject much like the Stigmatization - a vision of a heavenly figure who brings a final prophecy of passion and death. The style of the painting is Mantegnesque and, as is well known, Bellini followed in many respects Mantegna's composi- tion of the same subject also now in London (104). In this work Christ is approached by a bevy of angels, actually winged putti, standing on a cloud and bearing symbols of the Passion. Bellini reduced the number of angels to one, and even this one is denied the substantiality that such figures had traditionally possessed. For angels, though origi- nally conceived as emanations of God and thus as pure spirit, were early in Christian poetry and art given a body. They were normally endowed with the same substance as other figures. Theologians however, adhering to the conception of angels as spiritual essences, often compared them with light (105). In art angels are sometimes portrayed as sources of light; they radiate it, as in Taddeo Gaddi's Annunciation to the Shepherds in S. Croce, Florence. In a Gethsemane from the circle of Taddeo di Bartolo in the museum at Copenhagen the entire angel, including the flesh surfaces, is opaque white. But a more fundamental association with light is adumbrated in other representations, where the angels begin to lose substance and be- come immaterial like light itself. In Ambrogio Lorenzetti's Madonna in the Pinacoteca, Siena, their heads are rendered in a normal manner, but their bodies are painted over the incised rays emanating from the Virgin, so that they possess a vibrant luminosity (Fig. 30). In the circle of Fra Angelico angels are frequently rendered by a network of white lines on a blue sky (106). The unearthly nature of saints is sometimes represented in a similar manner. In the scene of the rescue of the three maidens in the Uffizi Ambrogio Lorenzetti painted St. Nicholas in pale gray and blue over gold leaf so that, unlike the other figures, the saint is almost translucent. Occasionally Byzantine striation in gold is revived for this purpose, as in the ascending body of St. Francis in the Bolognese panel of his Death in the Vatican Gallery (107). In Bellini's angel in London the demateriali- zation is more complete. His angel belongs al- together to a different order of reality than the other figures in the painting : it is a white, nearly weightless, translucent spirit. Such a spirit has no need of a substantial supporting cloud, but Bel- lini felt that it still needed something, and he put into the distant sky a cloud that, though far be- hind the figure, provides a sort of cushion for its feet. Christ in the Berlin Resurrection is provided with a similar distant support. Ghostly angels like Bellini's soon began to appear in the work of other painters under his (103) The church, a strange construction, is Romanesque except for what we may call the clerestory of the choir. Whether the position of the seraph above the Romanesque section and near the Gothic has a symbolic significance I would hesitate to sav. (104) E. Tietze-Conrat, Mantegna, New York, 1955, pl. 25.

FRANCIS 27 influence, as Foppa's Martyrdom of St. Sebastian in Mr. Berenson's Collection (108), or Ercole de' Robertas Agony in the Garden in Dresden (109). These pallid figures are « present » in the rep- resentation only in a special sense, and they readily acquire a private character, as though seen only by one of the actors or the beholder of the paint- ing. We cannot always be certain, in fact, just what they represent, whether miraculous appear- ances or the images in an actor's mind. In Ercole's extraordinary Pietà in Liverpool, behind the Virgin bearing the dead Christ in her lap there is a strange sort of ghostly Crucifixion (Fig. 31). It is a pictorial mode that Ercole approximates in the three scenes of the Infancy Cycle in the Brera Madonna , but there the scenes simulate stone reliefs. At first glance the figures in the Crucifixion at Liverpool might seem to be affected by aerial perspective, but they are actually not very distant. Originally this panel stood at the center of a predella between two long panels now in Dresden, one representing the Agony in the Garden, to which we have just referred, and the Betrayal, the other the Way to Calvary. The Crucifixion would then be an appropriate subject for the central panel; it is, however, not only relegated to the background but rendered in a curiously faint man- ner, conspicuously less substantial than the figures at an equal depth in the two predellas at the sides. Around the figures the rocks and sky, furthermore, are shadowy at their limits. Ercole seems to suggest not a present event but a past one, a memory that haunts the mind of the Virgin and of the beholder. In medieval art the content of the minďs eye or of conversation was portrayed in the same mode as the figures themselves (110). In the represen- tation of Pharaoh's dream, the cattle and the sheaves of wheat are no less substantial than the dreamer. The rise of naturalism in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries created the conditions for a differentiation. In Ercole's painting what seem to be inner thoughts are conveyed by pallid, shimmering forms, very different from those of the person who thinks them. A similar insubstan- tial mode was already introduced for the same purpose earlier in the fifteenth century. In a min- iature in the Bedford Hours , for instance, the premonitions of the Passion that assailed Christ as he knelt alone in the Garden of Olives actually hover, as pale grisaille images, over his head (Fig. 32). All these ghostly figures were probably influenced by those indistinct bluish forms that are visible in the backgrounds of fifteenth-century landscape - forms that are, in short, affected by aerial perspective. Thus one of the great triumphs of naturalism is subverted to unnatural ends. The method of portraying the spatially distant is utiliz- ed for the psychologically hidden and for the metaphysical. The ghostly angel in the Gethsemane in Lon- don is only one of the many consequences of Belli- ni's study of light and color during the 'sixties and 'seventies, a study that had consequences not only for his form but, we now see, for his iconography and his meaning as well (a11). In the Man of Sorrows in London light and color are essential in differentiating the cool, gray, ruinous Old World from the warm, productive New, as I have sug- gested elsewhere (112). Light and color contribute further iconographie or narrative meanings to the London Gethsemane also. The spirituality of the moment is of course conveyed by the communica- tion between Christ and the angel holding the chalice, but it is extended and deepened by the marvellous quality of the landscape, and, even more, the light that fills it. The lower part of the sky is bright with a radiance that issues from an invisible sun. The head of Christ, rising above the horizon into this area, lacks the traditional gold halo still worn by the apostles. It has instead a (109) See R. Longhi, Officina Ferrarese, Rome, 1934, fig. 101. (no) See O. PÄCHT, « A Giottesque Episode in English Mediaeval Art », Journal of the Warburg Institute, VI, 1943, p. 67. O11) In a related paper, « Light as Form and Symbol in Some Fifteenth-Century Paintings », in Art Bulletin, XXVII, 1945, pp. 175-181, I attempted to show that the ancient Christian association of light passing through a glass with the miraculous birth of Christ made its appearance in the visual arts only at a specific historical moment, characterized by the appearance or development of other luminary subjects, and by the greatly quickened interest of painters in light in general. There, as in the present paper, I have regarded iconography as responsive to form and as symbolic of deeper intrinsic meanings. O. PÄCHT, however, in the Burlington Magazine, XCVIII, 1956, p. 27 6, overlooks this point of view, though it is set forth at the beginning of the article and is implicit in the rest. (112) Ibid., pp. 175-176.</page><page sequence="19">28 MEISS - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS sort of immense natural halo. Or shall we, on the contrary, judge that the ardor of Christ has lighted the world and the sky ? There is here the fullest union of human experience, natural phenomenon, and supernatural event. Bellini has indeed insisted on this identity by placing just below the luminous angel a tower that is similarly vertical in shape and set out against the blue sky. It glows with the light of the sun, and it constitutes a sort of complement in the natural world to the human and heavenly forms that are near it. Two paintings by Bellini of the Transfiguration are also relevant to our theme (Figs. 13, 33). Again the subject is similar - a figure transported by a vision. When representing this event Quattrocento painters such as Baldovinetti had already abandon- ed the symbolic mandorla that once surrounded Christ (113). Bellini, in his very early representation in the Museo Correr, preserved only a narrow band of parallel rays around - or partly around - Christ (114), but above Him he introduced a new form (Fig. 33). In the sky is visible a large circle of white clouds almost, but not quite, normal in appearance. This slightly unnatural ring alludes, no doubt, to the « bright cloud » that « oversha- dowed » Christ and the prophets, and out of which came « a voice .... saying, This is my beloved Son .... » (115). Down below James sleeps - a characteristic Venetian innovation (116) - and John looks poignantly in the direction of a tender shoot growing from the stump of an old tree that had been felled with an axe. Already here in a very early work a tree seems to assume an expressive and symbolic role something like that of the laurel in the Frick panel. In the Pesaro altarpiece the drama of the conversion of St. Paul had already been echoed by a turbulent sky. In the Transfiguration in Naples the spiritual excitement of Christ, who is outwardly calm and majestic, is conveyed by an agitation in the world around Him. The terrain consists of restlessly heaving, intersecting knolls, and in the sky behind Christ there are dancing masses of clouds. Just as in the Frick picture, moreover, the painter has injected into this entirely naturalistic context a novel, partly unnatural heavenly light, unseen by the figures in the painting. Though the brightest sky, nearest the sun, is at the left, numer- ous rays dart from the cloud immediately above the head of Christ. These paintings by Bellini in London, Pesaro, and Naples, made around the time of the Frick panel, give us good reason to suppose that Bel- lini, wishing to dwell on the religious exaltation of St. Francis, might have taken the bold step of abandoning the seraph in a Stigmatization and of reducing evidences of this supernatural figure to an inconspicuous, very nearly natural radiation in the sky. Such a fundamental transformation of the theme was already prepared in the Pesaro altarpiece (Fig. 27), and it would not have remain- ed unique in the history of the representation of the subject. Later Renaissance and Baroque paintings tended increasingly to give to light the function of conveying a supernatural presence, and the seraph was often replaced by the tiny head of an angel (117). Furthermore, in a fresco in the vault of a chapel in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence - a fresco that no doubt represents the Stigmatization because of the behavior of Francis and Brother Leo - Bronzino has referred to the supernatural essence by a radiance alone (Fig. 34) (118). The pictorial field, it is true, is unusually constricted, and the triciput of the Trinity does appear at the center of the vault. A generation or so later painters such as Moretto in, broadly speaking, the Belli- nesque tradition, limited the heavenly phenomena in the Conversion of St. Paul to a shaft of light and eliminated the traditional image of God, though in this instance, it is true, his presence (113) R. Van Marle, Development, XI, 1929, fig. 154. (114) It is difficult to ascertain, at least in a photograph, how far these rays extend upward from the feet of Christ, where they are clearly visible. Furthermore, the surface of the panel is damaged. (115) Matthew XVII, 1. (ne) new form takes its place alongside other Venetian sleeping figures - the Christ Child and Venus - that I have discussed elsewhere (see n. 96). (117) See E. MÂLE, L'art religieux après le Concile de Trente, Paris. 1932, p. 177. (118) Craig H. Smyth generously called my attention to this fresco. The seraph does not appear in the Stigmatization in the fifteenth-century relief on the facade of S. Francesco, Piacenza, but the scene may have been cut down. P. V. FACCHINETTI, Le Stimmate di San Francesco d'Assisi, Milan, 1924, p. 112, says that the seraph is lacking in several representations of the Stigmatization, mostly of the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. In all those I have been able to control, however, notably Bellini's Pesaro predella (Fig. 27), Pintoricchio's fresco in the Araceli, Rome, and Guercino's painting in the Pinacoteca Comunale, Cesena, the contrary is true.</page><page sequence="20">Meiss - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS 29 was not required by the texts (Fig. 35) (119). Finally, a painter close to Orazio Gentileschi represented St. Francis kneeling on a rock outside a cave, his arms flung out and his wounds prominent. He is overwhelmed by a heavenly light in which there is no trace of the explicitly supernatural (Fig. 36). Bellini's modification of the Stigmatization would probably have been facilitated by the fact that the painting, unlike his other large panels, was apparently made for a private person. « Co" minciata da lui a M. Zuan Michiel », said Mar- cantonio Michiel; and Messer Zuan, even if he did not welcome so personal a religious conception, would very probably have permitted the painter greater iconographie freedom than any official or corporate body. But in this instance iconographie freedom apparently involved, as it not infrequently does, a recapture of an old, largely forgotten, re- ligious conception. From about the mid-thirteenth century on up to Bellini's time religious texts and paintings that dealt with the Stigmatization stressed increasingly the imprinting of the wounds on the body of St. Francis (120). Painters introduced rays that pass from the wounds of Christ to those of the saint, and in the texts there was a related development until in the late (ca. 1390) Franciscan treatise, Liber de Conformitate Vitae b. Patris Francisci ad Vitam Nostri Jesu Christi by Bartolommeo of Pisa, the visionary Christ actually printed the wounds with his own hands (121). Such conceptions, however, were foreign to the period immediately following the death of the saint. As I have said elsewhere, « the early paintings of the Stigmati- zation in Italy and the north » (and the early texts also) « express the spiritual relation of Francis to God rather than his physical likeness to Christ incarnate » (122). Rays did not pass from wound to wound, and the broken body was subordinate to the communion with God. According to the earliest accounts, the signs of the stigmata were not actually visible until after the saint's death (123). Even the relatively late Fioretti asserts that Francis was transformed into the likeness of Christ « non per martirio corporale ma per incendio menta- le » (124), and it is this spiritual ardor that is manifest in the Frick painting. An unseen power, symbolized by the light, regenerates the saint, and, so it seems, the whole of the visible world too - the wild - flowers and vine sprouting from the rocks, the dry branches bursting into leaf, and the quiet lonely donkey, who is mysteriously touch- ed with life like Adam at the creation (125). Whether this power is also imprinting stigma- ta on the saint's body cannot definitely be said. In this instance it is perhaps not the very end of the journey that is most interesting or even im- portant, but what one could see along the way. APPENDIX BELLINI, ZOPPO, AND THE PESARO ALTARPIECE The Stigmatization by Marco Zoppo in the Walters Art Gallery was, as Mr. Berenson suggest- ed many years ago (126), probably a part of the pre- della of this master's altarpiece painted for the Minorites in Pesaro (Figs. 28, 37). Zoppo's altar- piece, formerly in the Berlin collection, is 262 cm. high by 254 cm. wide (127). The Walters panel measures 36 cm. high by 47 cm. wide (128). Its (119) See W.

Martin and Lucy that were said to have come from Pesaro were perhaps parts of the predella. These panels were in the collection of Count U. Beni, Gubbio. The Berlin altarpiece was burnt in 1945. (128) Its inventory number is 37.544. Mr. Edward S. King, director of the Walters Gallery, kindly informs me that it was bought by Henry Walters in Rome in 1902, as part of the Massarenti collection.

Miss Elisabeth Packard of the Walters Gallery informs me that none of the four edges of the Stigmatization is original, but the composition of the painting indicates that the panel was never much larger.</page><page sequence="21">30 MEISS - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST. FRANCIS height, a little more than one-eighth that of the Berlin panel, is thus within proper limits for a predella, and if it were placed below the St. Francis, there would be space for a similar panel below each of the other saints as well as a longer one, more than one and a half the width of the others, beneath the Madonna. Though the Stigmatization is not as well pre- served as the large panel, it seems to have been painted at the same moment in Zoppo's career. Especially striking is the geological similarity; the same fantastic rock formations appear in both panels. The halo of Francis, a translucent plate marked by diverging rays, is repeated in the Berlin painting. If the church in the background of the Walters panel is, as Berenson suggested, a recol- lection of S. Ciriaco, Ancona - which seems prob- able - then the ties of the Stigmatization with the Pesaro altarpiece are increased. It is true that the altarpiece was signed « IN VINEXIA ». It is true also that none of the descriptions of it, beginning with Vasari, mentions a predella (129), but since the altarpiece had, by 1550, already been moved from one church to another, the predella might have been detached. Altogether the evidence is sufficient to attach the Stigmatization to the altar- piece with great probability (1S0). Inasmuch as Zoppo's altarpiece is dated 1471, the Stigmatization in Baltimore, if it belonged to it, might provide evidence for the date of the major work of Bellini's early career. The two representations of the Stigmatization are certainly connected in some way; they share not only the novel averted seraph but broad similarities of com- position (Figs. 27, 28). In both there is at one Princeton, August 1959 side a large rock mass with a cave, at the other side an exceptionally large church, and in between a battlemented city wall. There the resemblance seems to cease. In Zoppo's panel the seraph is much nearer to the saint and the posture of St. Francis is more conventional. Indeed Bellini's painting is in most respects much farther from the traditional composition, so that we must sup- pose either that it represents a development of Zoppo's composition, or that Zoppo reduced to more conventional terms a strikingly novel concep- tion by Bellini. The former alternative would be in accord with the current estimate of the date of the Pesaro altarpiece, ca. 1473-75, and it would lead us to conclude that Bellini saw Zoppo's altar- piece in Venice or when he arrived in Pesaro to undertake his own. The second alternative has however the great advantage of supposing that Bellini, rather than the less imaginative Zoppo, was the inventor of the averted seraph, and it therefore seems preferable. Of course there is the usual third possibility: the two paintings derive from a lost model. In the circumstances such a model is likely to have been the work only of Jacopo Bellini, Donatello in Padua, or Andrea Mantegna. No representations of the subject by Mantegna or Donatello have come down to us, and the two drawings by Jacopo Bellini show only a rather distant seraph, apparently not an averted one (131). The upshot of all this is that Zoppo may have seen drawings for Bellini's Pesaro altarpiece, or even the altarpiece itself, before completing his in 1471. If he did, then Bellini's great work would have been under way a few years earlier than has usually, for stylistic reasons, been supposed. (128) VASARI, ed. Milanesi, III, p. 406 (then already in the « chiesa nuova di San Giovanni Evangelista »); Catalogo delle pitture che si conservano nelle chiese di Pesaro, Pesaro, 1783, p. 60 (a reference I owe to the kindness of Ulrich Middel- dorf). C. MALVASIA, Felsina Pittrice , Bologna, 1841, I, p. 39, still places the altarpiece in the Chiesa Nuova, though it was in the Sally Collection in 1821. (13D) Conceivably the Man of Sorrows with two angels now in the Museum at Pesaro was the central pinnacle of the altarpiece ( Catalogo della esposizione della pittura ferrarese del Rinascimento , Ferrara, 1933, n. 69). It is similar in style and was once in the same church (see the Catalogo of 1783 cited in the proceding note). F. Zeri has independently come to the same conclusion ( Paragone , 107, 1958, p. 40). (131) The seraph has the usual position in the drawings in the Louvre (V. Golubew, Die Skizzenbücher Jacopo Bellinis, Brussels, 1912, II, pl. 67) and in London {ibid., I, pl. 47). The figure in the latter is distant, small, and partly effaced, but Philip Pouncey, who very kindly examined it for me, reported that it is turned towards the Saint, and I have since been able to confirm this myself.</page><page sequence="22">Meiss - GIOVANNI BELLINI'S ST.
