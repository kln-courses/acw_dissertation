<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert L. Burgess and Don Bushell Jr. (eds.) Behavioural Sociology: The Experimental Analysis of Social Process. New York and London: Columbia University Press, 1969, xiii + 418 pp., $12.50. This book of readings is divided into three parts. After a characteristically lucid prologue by George Homans, we are offered six papers under the title of Foundations for the Experi- mental Analysis of Social Process, six more on The Experimental Analysis of Social Process in the field and a final five on Theo- retical Extensions of the Experimental Analysis of Social Process. The only wholly original contributions are those made by the editors. The dust-cover makes the strange claim that this is the first book to 'set out the achievements and the potential of reinforce- ment theory in experimental studies of human social behaviour.' This is simply not true. (Unless of course the writer has an idio- syncratic conception of the achievements and potential of this school.) Several social psychology text books in the last ten years have drawn extensively upon reinforcement theory. One of the most widely used texts in this country is Secord and Backman's Social Psychology , which uses exchange theory as a general integrating theory through- out its six hundred pages. One would be happier to welcome this collection of papers if only the authors, or at least the editors, had faced up somewhere to the criticisms which have been levelled against behaviouristic social science in the last decade. Chomsky does not come in for a mention, neither does Charles Bolton whose excellent article 'Is Sociology a Behavioural Science ?' appeared nearly seven years ago.

The arguments which are advanced by the behaviourists against contemporary sociology are well known. They continue to express their surprise that no-one will look at how things are in everyday life, they caution against the dangers of grand theorising, point out the perils of historicism, lament the failure of sociological studies to predict and then proceed to raise the curtain on operant conditioning (golden rule - cherchez la r√©- compense). Operant conditioning allows us not only a chance "to bring men back into sociology once more" but also promises us a chance to change them once they are there. (See, e.g., 'Systematic Socialisation; A Programmed Environment for the Habitu- ation of Antisocial Retardates*, by John D. Burchard in this collection). The type of man who is brought back in by the behaviourists is also a familiar creature. He appears in these pages as a mindless (in the common-sense meaning of the word), unreflective individual, who emits responses when confronted with particular situations, who increases his response rate when rein- forced, who undergoes extinction when such reinforcements cease. These men are not to be found within interactional contexts, they do not try to make sense of their situation, they operate without consciously representing future situations to themselves, they use words as mere alternatives to objects and not as objects in their own right, they are products of past conditioning and not agents of present social change, they do not build up construc- tions of reality but acquire behavioural repertoires. The simplest example, taken from a chapter by Bushell and Burgess, shows just a few of the restrictions under which 'behavioural man* operates. They have described a slot-machine player who has been on a continuous rein- forcement schedule (CRF). The machine pays back twice what is put in every time. 'Under this reinforcement schedule, the lever 10A pulling response will be emitted at a high steady rate.' When the reinforcement stops, what will happen? 'We shall see the player make a few rapid tests as if to make sure that he's no longer going to reap a steady two-for- one profit and then stop playing completely and move onto some other activity.' (My italics, to draw attention to the way behaviour- ists guard against anthropomorphism - par- ticularly when they are talking about man !) The player is apparently under the control of the reinforcer. But this is a totally inadequate account even of this highly specific non- interactional situation. As Rotter and his associates have experimentally demonstrated elsewhere, we must take into consideration what the individual thinks is happening and not merely whether the machine (or the social group or the social institution) rewards him. Players who regard their winnings as the result of skill will behave quite differently during 'extinction trials' than those who believe themselves merely to have been enjoying a lucky run. Even with man and machine, we need some reference to the actor's definition of the situation before we can understand what is happening or even begin to predict his behavior with any accuracy. So many of the studies described here sound as though they could so easily go the way of those experiments on the operant conditioning of verbal responses in which the subjects suddenly emerged not as mindless men under the control of a nodding instructor, but as thinking individuals who had worked out what the instructor wanted by observing his approval and had then conscientiously and quite consciously proceeded to give it to him. It is perhaps a matter for some concern (or at least for some analysis) that at a moment when crude behaviourism is fighting for its life against cognitive theory in psychology departments, that a group of operant condi- tioners should be so intent upon establishing a sociological beach-head. Apart from the contributions by Homans, Skinner and Kunkel there is not much here to suggest that a welcoming party should be sent. University of York Laurie Taylor</page></plain_text>
