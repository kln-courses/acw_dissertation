G.M.Radick@leeds.ac.uk Abstract. The playback experiment - the playing back of recorded animal sounds to the animals in order to observe their responses - has twice become central to celebrated researches on non-human primates. First, in the years around 1890, Richard Garner, an amateur scientist and evolutionary enthusiast, used the new wax cylinder phonograph to record and reproduce monkey utterances with the aim of translating them. Second, in the years around 1980, the ethologists Peter Marler, Robert Seyfarth, and Dorothy Cheney used tape recorders in a broadly similar way to test whether the different predator calls of one monkey species, vervet monkeys, warn about different kinds of predator. This paper explores the circumstances leading to the ca. 1890 invention and the ca. 1980 reinvention of the primate playback experiment. In both instances, I show, the experiment served as a riposte to those arguing, on scientific grounds, that an unbridgeable gap divides human language from animal communication. I also consider how far progress in technology explains the timing of invention and reinvention. I conclude with some reflections on sifting contingent from inevitable aspects of the history of the primate playback experiment, and of scientific achievements more generally.

It took place in Washington, D. C., in the zoo- logical garden then under construction behind the Smithsonian build- ing. Near the monkey cage, a "group of eminent doctors and professors," about a dozen, including the Secretary, had gathered to observe a test of whether monkeys talk. In charge was Richard L. Garner, "Prof. Garner," one of the Smithsonian's "honorary curators."</page><page sequence="2">462 GREGORY RADICK Garner had with him a graphophone - a version of the phonograph - and had inserted its large tin horn through the cage door. As the learned company watched attentively, "Prof. Garner ground away at the hand- graphophone with its crank attachment," while "the Keeper of the animals poked the monkeys up with a stick to make them talk." The cage held two monkeys, one wild and one tame. The wild monkey kept quiet, apart from the occasional enraged scream. The tame one "did nothing but chatter and gibber most unintelligibly, as it seemed to the rest of the audience; but Prof. Garner was inclined to think that this was really conversation worth taking down," and proceeded to fill six wax cylinders with recorded monkey utterances. These records were the means to a novel scientific end: Prof. Garner was very far from imagining that he would be able to understand this monkey-talk when repeated to him by the machine. But his notion was to record the remarks of one monkey and grind them out through the horn for the benefit of the other monkey, so as to observe what sort of responses the second one would make. By comparing the original observations and the replies, he hoped to get some few clews [sic] that would eventually enable him to translate the monkey language.' Garner's phonographic experiments with Stateside simians between 1890 and 1892 became the starting point for research that would make him one of the best-known scientific men of his day. The popular press could not get enough of "the monkey man," especially, from 1891, his plan to take a phonograph to the African jungle, install the machine and himself in a metal cage, and set to work on the utterances of wild gorillas and chimpanzees.2 Years after his death in 1920, journalists could count on readers knowing who Garner was and what he was famous for.3 Among philologists, psychologists, and anthropologists, meanwhile, Garner was acknowledged as a pioneering student of primate commu- nication and the inventor of a promising new method for its study. The philologist E. P. Evans, for instance, reckoned the phonograph a "scientific weapon of phonetic precision" which, in Garner's hands, had eliminated the need to rely on paltry human powers to imitate and desc- ribe simian sounds. Evans foresaw the phonograph doing for philology ' "Can Monkeys Talk?," 1890.

James annotated his copy of his Principles of Psychol- ogy (1890) with a reference to Garner's first article on the "simian ton- gue," whose words differed only in degree from human words, thus representing "the rudiments from which the tongues of mankind could easily develop."6 Some years later, when an American student in Ger- many, John P. Harrington, asked Wundt if apes have language, Wundt directed the young man to Garner's work. Harrington later used the phonograph extensively in legendary field studies of American Indian languages - studies, as he saw it, inspired by Garner's example.7 But fame is famously fickle. By the mid-twentieth century, Garner's had largely deserted him. When his name surfaces now, it tends to be in connection with one of three things: his use of a cage to observe apes (taken up by a character in a minor Jules Verne novel, The Village in the Treetops); his claim to have successfully taught a few words to a young chimpanzee while in the Congo; and his invention of what are now called playback experiments, or playbacks.8 The experiment 4 Evans, 1893, quotation on p. 438, and Evans, 1897, p. 315. 5 Jastrow, 1892, p. 215, reviewing Garner, 1892a.

The Verne novel features a German doctor, Johausen, who sets off into the jungle with a cage to complete the research into monkey language left unfinished by Garner. See Verne, 1901. In Adrian Desmond's book on the ape language controversies of the 1 970s, he depicted Garner in his cage in 1892-3 as "like some zoological specimen marked 'Victorian Homo sapiens,' recording on the latest wax-cylinder phonograph the bewil- dered reactions of a wealth of animals (including gorillas) who trooped up to inspect him" (Desmond, 1979, p. 254, n. 3). In fact Garner never managed to get a working phonograph in Africa on that first expedition.

It is, in essence, as simple as described in the newspaper report above: record the sounds of the animals under study, then play the recordings back to the animals and observe their responses. Strikingly, after the initial rise to prominence with Garner, the experiment virtually disappeared from the scientific repertoire. Throughout the early twentieth century, there are only scattered in- stances, of little impact. Playbacks began to be performed again in a sustained way only in the late 1940s and 1950s, when they were used mainly in studies of fish, insects, amphibians, and especially birds.9 The technique did not become the pivot of an admired research pro- gram in primate communication again until the late- 1 970s. Once again, however, media interest was intense. "Studies in Africa Find Monkeys Using Rudimentary 'Language"' was how the New York Times headlined the report on its front page one morning in November 1980. According to the Times, two ethologists at Rockefeller University, Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney, together with their postdoctoral supervisor Peter Marler, had completed a series of playback experi- ments with vervet monkeys at a national park in Kenya. These mon- keys, it was explained, were known to produce different vocalizations in response to sightings of three different predators: leopards, eagles, and pythons. On hearing these different alarm calls, furthermore, the vervets responded as if informed about which predator needed escaping: run- ning up a tree at the leopard alarm; running into the bushes at the eagle alarm; scrutinizing the ground at the python alarm. Through the use of playbacks, Cheney, Seyfarth, and Marler claimed to have found, in the reporter's words, "strong evidence that the monkeys respond not just to the urgency of the calls but to the semantic content as well, specifying different categories of animals or types of danger." The vervet predator calls thus seemed to be "elements of a rudimentary language" - a conclusion the researchers expected to be controversial, since, the dance language of the bees excepted, the "ability to convey messages that carry such specific information content has always been considered a distin- guishing feature of human speech."l1 9 On the history of playbacks, see Falls, 1992.

The work reported here was published in Seyfarth et al., 1980a and 1980b; and Seyfarth and Cheney, 1980. I cannot resist pointing out that Garner too made the front page of the New York Times, on his return to the States from his first African trip; "Thinks Well...," 1894.</page><page sequence="5">PRIMATE LANGUAGE AND THE PLAYBACK EXPERIMENT 465 Since 1980, there have been countless playback experiments with non-human primates, in laboratories and in the field. The primate playback has stabilized into an off-the-shelf resource, susceptible of endless variation. The facts about vervet predator calls, meanwhile, have stabilized into factoids. People who know almost nothing else about monkeys will often have heard about the ones with "words" for leopard, eagle, and python. It can now be learned from the inside of soft-drink bottle caps, or from television, where footage of Cheney and Seyfarth in the field has become a staple of natural history program- ming. For these junior members of the Rockefeller group, the predator call playbacks served as a point of entry into a decade-long enquiry into vervet social lives and social intelligence. Thanks in part to the advocacy of the philosopher Daniel Dennett, the vervet research became widely known as a shining example both of the new "cognitive ethology" and of the traditional virtues of assumptions of design in nature." Cheney and Seyfarth's farewell to the vervets, How Monkeys See the World (1990), has the status of a classic. 12 Over the last quarter century, serious thinkers on the evolutionary origins of language - a topic with a notoriously thin empirical base - have needed to confront the vervet alarm call experiments and their interpretation.'3 The three members of the Rockefeller group were not at all conscious of following in the footsteps of Garner. He was unknown to Seyfarth and Cheney, and little more than a dim and superseded historical figure to Marler. The story of the primate playback experiment is thus one of invention and reinvention. It is, at the same time, one of asking and re-asking, for the playback technique enacted a question: what will experiment reveal about the meaning of primate vocalizations for the primates themselves? The aim in what follows is to examine the con- ditions under which this question came to be asked, and under which playbacks emerged as an attractive answer, first in the years around 1890, and then in the years around 1980. At the end, I will suggest some general conclusions about the sciences and their histories. At the outset, however, I shall consider something much more straightforward: that the primate playback experiment kept to a schedule dictated by technology. 1 Dennett, 1983.

Jared Diamond in particular (pp. 126-127) emphasizes how crucial the vervet playback experiments are in modern theorizing about language origins.</page><page sequence="6">466 GREGORY RADICK Tools and Timing "Technological determinism" is, like "social Darwinism," a term of abuse. It is something coarse that one hopes not to be accused of. Nothing is less surprising, therefore, than a historian denying that technologies or applications of them were inevitable.'4 On the whole, what follows will be, on this point, impeccably orthodox. We will see how much needed to be in place for playback experiments with primates to seem worth doing, and worth finding out about, beyond the mere availability of suitable recording devices. Still, when we ask why Gar- ner's experiments happened when they did, we should not miss the obvious: that before the end of the nineteenth century, there was no such thing as recording technology. The first phonograph dates from 1877. There were, of course, precedents, more or less obscure. But Edison's invention of the tinfoil phonograph marked the entry into public consciousness of machines that could preserve and reproduce sound. The early phonographs daz- zled more by their promise than achievement; we still speak disparag- ingly of "tinny" recordings. And indeed progress, after a decade-long hiatus, was rapid. In 1887, Bell introduced the graphophone, whose wax-covered cylinders furnished higher fidelity and more durable recordings. Edison followed in 1888 with a wax-cylinder device of his own, the "Perfected Phonograph," powered not by hand-cranking but by electricity from his firm's batteries. A mere two years later, Garner was using the improved machine - he used both graphophones and phonographs - in playback experiments with monkeys at the zoological garden in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. It appears, then, that a decent short answer to the question, "why 1890 for the first primate playbacks?," is: "because the technology did not permit it much before that time." No sooner had a machine capable of playbacks come along than someone used it for that purpose. Not just anyone, moreover, but a citizen of a country where graphophones and phonographs were better distributed than anywhere else in the world, indeed in a city where, on one estimate, recording technology enjoyed a public presence without parallel.

But they are only a part. Just as important, as we shall see, was Garner's immersion in the debates over Darwinism in his day. Although not trained in the sciences, Garner was familiar with elite controversies over language and evolu- tion, and eager for the victory of the evolutionists. What he later remembered as a defining event was a debate that broke out among his fellow schoolteachers one day. The topic was phonetics, then a new enthusiasm, widely held to be the key to more effective teaching of reading and writing. In the course of the meeting, Garner volunteered that animals, too, had language, but to a lesser degree than humans had. The other teachers shouted him down so vociferously, as he recalled, that it resolved him to action. It was then that his enquiries among the monkeys began.'6 Throughout the 1880s, he made attempts at translation, but found these frustrating. It was just too hard: too hard to remember what the animal's utterances sounded like; to devise a notation that truly represented the utterances; to hear exactly what was uttered; to imitate the utterances back to the animals with preci- sion.17 It was this prior history of failure in research into the animal roots of language that enabled Garner to see in the improved phono- graph what no-one else saw: a means for vindicating the Darwinian theory. As he was reported as saying in an interview, "At last came the Edison phonograph. I was being shipwrecked, when this wonderful machine saved me."' 8 So technological determinism falls short for 1890. What of 1980? One admirer of the vervet experiments, the evolutionary biogeographer Jared Diamond, has glossed them in determinist fashion. According to Diamond, "the recognition of vervet language was long delayed because vervets are much better tuned to the distinctions among their grunts than we are. To decode their grunts required tape recorder playback experiments, facilitated by the open habitat and small territories in which vervets live."19 It is relatively easy to decide whether the trans- lation of vervetese depended on tape recorders available only from the mid- to late-1970s. Much of the vervet lexicon, including the predator 16 On the discussion at the Teachers' Institute, see R. L. Garner, "The Speech of Animals," unpublished ms, in the Papers of R. L.

I will come back to Struhsaker's contribution below.20 Harder to judge is a different but related possibility: that, once modern "bioacoustics" was underway, it was only a matter of time before someone got around to applying its armamentarium, playbacks included, to non-human primates. A number of scientific authors emphasize how important was the arrival in the late 1940s of portable tape recorders and, just as crucially, sound spectrographs, which visualize the patterns of frequencies and intensities in complex sounds. The first twentieth-century playbacks of note occurred at around this 21 time. There is no denying the energizing effect of these innovations. On the other hand, Garner's precedent alerts us to the availability of the means for doing playbacks well before mid-century.22 From around 1900, the most popular devices were, it is true, reproduction-only devices. But wax cylinder phonographs and, later, disk-cutting machines could always be purchased. Cumbersome though they were, these found their way into the field. American ethnologists and European comparative musicolo- gists used them extensively.23 Among zoologists, the best known proponent was Ludwig Koch, who, from his childhood in Germany in 20 Some clarification is required here. Diamond in the quotation refers to "grunts." For the nonspecialist, it is natural enough to use that word to describe all vervet vocaliza- tions, the alarm calls included. And so Diamond does (p. 50): "When you listen to vervets, it at first appears that they are uttering undifferentiated grunts. But if you listen carefully, you may be able to distinguish differences among the grunts. Experiments with tape recording and playback of wild vervet vocalizations revealed that the vervets have at least ten different grunts, including separate 'words' for their three major predators (leopards, snakes, and eagles)...." Struhsaker, however, and Cheney and Seyfarth after him, have always distinguished the grunts of the vervets from their predator alarm calls. On the playback-based grunt experiments that followed on from the initial playback- based alarm call experiments, see Seyfarth and Cheney, 1992, p. 339.

In the 1910s, as Marion Thomas shows elsewhere in this issue, the French scientist Louis Boutan used the phonograph in Garnerian research into gibbon language. In the 1920s, Raymond Ditmars, reptile specialist at the Bronx zoo and a longtime friend and supporter of Garner's, was engaged in experimental work with a macaque. A month after Garner's death in 1920, a New York newspaper reported that an "old style cylinder phonograph was employed by Dr. Ditmars in an experiment in recording monkey speech and then observing the animal's reactions to the reproduction of its own voice."25 In the 1930s, Koch collaborated with Julian Huxley, a dis- tinguished observer and theorist of bird behavior (among many other things), on Animal Language, a lavish "sound book" combining text, photographs, and records of animals in zoos, mainly in Regent's Park and Whipsnade. As Huxley explained, after recording, the two men assayed "the animals' reactions to their own sounds as recorded here. Mr. Koch has played these from the records to most of the animals used. The results were rather surprising. Some animals became excited, while others showed no reactions at all." Among the animals thus studied were a mandrill, a mangabey, and a baboon.26 In 1937, the same year as Koch's zoo playbacks in England, the American physiological psychologist Clarence Ray Carpenter con- ducted field playbacks in the jungles of Siam. Their circumscribed nature is instructive. Carpenter was in Siam, as is well known, with a group investigating the anatomy and behavior of the native gibbons. For purposes of studying their vocalizations, he had brought along customized recording equipment and associated paraphernalia. His monograph on the expedition presented a detailed typology of gibbon calls and quantitative data on their frequency in the course of a day. Acutely interested in the social functions of calls, he dwelt especially on the "stimulus situations" that elicited vocalization and on the responses thus stimulated in others. He seems, however, to have based his 24 Koch, 1955. 25 Sparkes, 1920. Ditmars was described as "a strong advocate of the theories of Professor Garner." 26 Huxley and Koch, 1938, pp. 5-6, quotation on p. 5. See also Koch, 1955, pp. 52, 67. Huxley - who as Secretary of the Zoological Society of London effectively ran the Regent's Park and Whipsnade zoos - was quite taken with these activities: "Students of animal behaviour will be able to make experiments on the differences between related species, on the share of what is innate and what is learnt in determining reaction (or absence of reaction) to specific sounds, and so on. In any case, it is clear that an interesting field, with both practical and theoretical sides, is here opened up by the advance of technique" (p. 6).</page><page sequence="10">470 GREGORY RADICK functional characterizations on observations alone, following the pat- tern of his earlier, recorder-less field study of howler monkeys. He re- ported no playback experiments done to check his conjectures about function. Rather, he deferred such experiments for future laboratory investigations, much like the ones he had once done on the influence of hormones on animal behavior. "It is especially desirable," wrote Car- penter, "to isolate individual specimens from extraneous factors, stim- ulate them with single vocal patterns and record the overt responses." In the wild, these patterns' "functions are extremely difficult to infer," not least, according to Carpenter, because it had proved impossible to record anything except high-volume, inter-group vocalizations.27 Nevertheless, as Georgina Montgomery emphasizes elsewhere in this issue, there were some field playbacks. Carpenter did not, in his published remarks, describe them as "experiments," and he drew no particular attention to them at the time.28 Nor did he become well known for them. But, on several occasions, he did listen for and watch for the responses from surrounding gibbons while reproducing their recorded voices. There is no harm in letting technological determinism do a little explaining here. Lug all that fancy apparatus into the jungle and, at some time or another, you will find yourself reproducing the sounds of 27 Carpenter, 1940, pp. 169-182, quotations on pp. 170, 178. The phrase "stimulus situation" is on p. 169 and the table on p. 171. For the comparable section of the howler monograph, see Carpenter, 1934, pp. 107-112. On the physiological legacy in Car- penter's primatological work, see Haraway, 1989, pp. 86ff., and Montgomery, this issue. In his historical survey of playbacks, J. Bruce Falls has noted that the technique is "a special case of methods used for a long time by physiologists to study stimulus-response systems." Falls, 1992, p. 13. 2 In his 212-page 1940 monograph, there is, as far as I can tell, just one sentence. It occurs in a passage about how easy it is to stimulate gibbons to vocalize. All a gibbon needs to be set off, Carpenter wrote, is to hear another gibbon, or even "a person roughly imitating" a gibbon. Even a reproduced record of a gibbon will serve, as Carpenter discovered: "Coolidge and I had just made our first satisfactory recordings of Type II calls produced by Group 1 and when we adjusted out recorder and played these back, the vocalizations were answered one series after another" (p. 180). A shorter 1939 article likewise contains one sentence: "Several times it was possible to stimulate the wild ani- mals to call by playing back to them the recordings of their own calls which had just been made" (Carpenter, 1939, p. 325). Carpenter was much more effusive twenty-five years later, in his contribution to a conference and then volume on animal communication. Playback was now all the rage, and he credited himself with "originat[ing] in miniature" in Siam a procedure that could be used "for validating calls and for checking their fidelity in terms of responses as well as providing a means of controlled study of the functions of different sound signals" (Carpenter, 1969, p. 55). For the latter two references, I am indebted to Georgina Montgomery, whose interpretation of their place in Carpenter's work is nevertheless different from my own.

It is, in such a circumstance, an obvious thing to do. And it was never more so than in the era when Garner's work was still within living memory.29 No doubt there were other be-phonographed ethnologists and musicologists who did the same, in otherwise quiet moments on the reservations and in the back- country villages. There is nothing extraordinary about playbacks in themselves, given the existence of recording technology capable of performing them. What is extraordinary is that the playback experiment ever became the center of a major scientific research effort into primate communication, and that the results were of interest to a wider com- munity. The challenge lies in accounting for how that happened, not once but twice. Why 1890 and 1980? What made the playback experi- ment with primates something worth doing, and worth attending to, at those times but not at others? Garner's Primate Playbacks, or, Why 1890? The origin of language has puzzled thinkers since antiquity. But with the rise of evolutionism in the mid-nineteenth century, the puzzle became at once more precise and more pressing. Much more so than in the past, debate now centered on comparisons and contrasts between human language and the vocal productions of non-human animals. Those opposed to the "ape theory" routinely adduced language as fatal to the theory since, by their lights, language appeared to have no analogues among the lower animals. The anti-Darwinian case was put most firmly and famously by the Oxford Sanskritist and scientific publicist Friedrich Max Muller.30 According to Muller, the only positive evidence available for scien- tific inferences about the origin of language was the linguistic roots - the irreducible elements of language, into which the different languages of the world could be resolved. The most rigorous comparative-philolog- ical scholarship showed, he claimed, that these roots always had abstract meanings. Since the roots were conceptual and, by definition, irreducible, they could not, he argued, have evolved from still more 29 In his 1940 monograph, Carpenter cited Garner's 1900 book Apes and Monkeys: Their Life and Language (1900). 30 On language in the Victorian debates over Darwinism, and Muller's role in partic- ular, see Radick, 2000b, esp. chs. I and 2. A useful collection of primary sources is Harris, 1996. For developments in the German context, see DiGregorio, 2002.

Far from showing traces of evolution from ani- mal antecedents, then, the roots from which human languages grew must have come into being fully formed, completely abstract, sometime near the beginning of man's tenure on earth. Muller first stated these views in 1861, in a much-discussed lecture series at the Royal Institution in London. Over the next thirty years, his argument underwent inter- esting changes, some quite concessionary. On the whole, however, he was resolute: an evolutionary account of the origin of language foun- dered on the evidence.31 In his 1873 "Lectures on Mr. Darwin's Philosophy of Language," also at the Royal Institution, he put the challenge plainly: "Show me only one single root in the language of animals, such as AK, to be sharp and quick; and from it two such derivatives as asva, the quick one - the horse - and acutus, sharp or quick-witted ... and I should say that, as far as language is concerned, we cannot oppose Mr Darwin's argument, and that man has, or at least may have been, developed from some lower animal."32 At the summer 1891 meeting of the British Association, Muller, speaking as President of the Anthropology section, looked back on his long campaign with satisfaction. "It required some courage at times to stand up against the authority of Darwin," he told his audience, "but at present all serious thinkers agree ... that there is a specific difference between the human animal and all other animals, and that that difference consists in language."33 Muller's popular reputation as a man of science was immense, and his provocation to the evolutionists therefore a serious one. It received its most potent answer in Garner's research program. The phono- graphic experiments, supplemented with a number of interesting psy- chological ones, seemed to furnish positive evidence that language among the non-human animals was no different in kind from human language.34 Watching Garner at work in the monkey house in the zoological gardens of New York's Central Park in December 1891, one onlooker-"somebody who wanted to flaunt his erudition," as the journalist on hand waspishly put it - was said to ask: "And what's to become of the Max Muller business about Sanskrit?" Appearing in Harper's Weekly, the report on the Central Park experiments under- scored the importance of the experiments for the Darwinian cause: "If we accept the Darwinian theory, and should Mr. Garner's life work be accomplished, the advocates of evolution will have found a new and 3' On Muller's life and thought, see Radick, 2004. 32 Muller, 1873, p. 229, emphasis in original.

We need also to take into account Garner's particular conception of that theory. In Harper's Weekly, Garner was quoted as follows: Granted that I have got to the bottom of monkey talk, my task would be but half accomplished. I will have but forged a single link in the chain. I want another. I propose to take down the speech of the lowest specimens of the human race - the pygmies, the Bush- men ... the Hottentot cluck and click. If there be family resem- blance, structural relationship, between the Rhesus monkey, the chimpanzee, and the lower grades of humanity, there may be correlation of speech, philological kinship, and then - and then - the origin of man's talk might be found.37 The ideas about evolution, race, and language here were absolutely commonplace in the second half of the nineteenth century. They included: that evolutionary change was gradual and progressive; that its highest products were humans; that the lowest humans were the savage or bar- barous races, such as the Fuegians or the Australian aborigines or the Hottentots; that the highest races were the civilized ones, especially the white European civilized ones; and that human racial highness and low- ness showed itself in body as well as mind, including language. It is sometimes said that these belong to a "non-Darwinian revolution," since real Darwinism, or at least Darwin himself, had little truck with talk of higher and lower, or evolutionary hierarchy.38 But even Darwin accepted that gradual evolution had produced a world where lesser human races spoke lesser languages. By and large, it was the anti-evolutionists of the day who argued otherwise. Darwin understood the hierarchy among living beings as something his theory predicted and explained.39 3 Phillips, 1891. 36 "The Phonograph to Aid...," 1892. 17 Phillips, 1891. 38 On Darwin as an anti-progressionist, out of step with his times, see Gould, 1996, discussed in Radick, 2000c.

Darwin accepted that the apparent language gap was real. But for him, crucially, it yawned between descendants of a long extinct common ancestor, not between descendants and ancestors. In effect Darwin filled the gap with a plausible conjecture about the past. Far from rejecting or undermining hierarchy, he historicized it.40 Less sophisticated evolutionists tended not to exercise this option. They had an attenuated to non-existent sense of present species as tips on an irregularly-branching tree extending deep into the past. Garner's solution to the gap problem belongs to this more popular, present-centered conception of gradual evolution. He argued that, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the hierarchical scale did indeed extend from the lowest existing human race straight through to the highest existing animals. People like Darwin had failed to detect this continuity, in Garner's view, because the simian tongues were so rapid and subtly modulated. What was needed was a machine that could record simian utterances, thus enabling their analysis, not least through repeti- tion back to the animals under controlled conditions. What was needed, in short, was the phonograph. For Garner, the playback experiment was so important because it proved just what the theory of evolution, as he understood it, predicted: that just below the most primitive human race, with its primitive lan- guage, there was an animal species speaking a still more primitive lan- guage. In his first "Simian Tongue" article, Garner described how through these sorts of experiments he had translated Capuchin words for "food," "drink," "sickness," "storm," and "alarm." These in turn, as he wrote in the third installment, could be slotted into a hierarchy, with the words of spider monkeys below, the words of chimpanzees above, and "the lowest order of human speech" a further step up. Garner was in no doubt that the utterances he was translating counted as words. Where the most highly evolved humans, under demanding conditions of life, used complex sounds to transmit complex ideas between complex minds, so monkeys, under less demanding conditions of life, used simple sounds to transmit simple ideas between simple 40 For Darwin's handling of the "great break in the organic chain between man and his nearest allies," see Darwin, 1871, p. 200.

Simian words were no different in kind from human words, and no less well adapted to the purpose of language.4' In sum, then, there are several important clues to "why 1890?" in Garner's material and intellectual circumstances: in his living at a time and place where credibly good-enough phonographs were around, and when a widespread conception of evolution - and well-known doubts about it - put a premium on the discovery of humanlike language among the non-human primates. Indeed, it may have fallen to an amateur scientist to invent the primate playback experiment precisely because a more elite figure would not have seen in its results facts that bore directly on human evolution. Garner, it should be noted, made no apologies for being an amateur. Consider his public farewell, published on the eve of his journey to the French Congo in 1892: Many who are called men of science spend their lives in acquiring knowledge of what others have done, and these men of letters are usually regarded as the high priests of science; but they are really the laymen, and in very few instances have they ever added any- thing to the volume of human knowledge; and while it seems to be an innate law that one must rule and ninety-nine serve, I do not envy those who stand and wait, who are content to plod along the graded ways of science and simply learn what other men have known; I prefer to lead the way, however difficult.... I would rather blaze one mile through the forests of science than travel forty leagues along the paved and lighted thoroughfares of learning. I would rather find the bones of one new and unknown genus than possess a whole museum of familiar forms; and so I feel about the 'Simian Tongue.'.... The results of such an expedition [as mine], however meagre in comparison with what may justly be hoped, will contribute more to philology than all the books and theses of modern times.42 Garner presented his amateur status as a source of epistemic and moral virtue. As he saw it, the academy housed spineless, scholastic bigots, content to spin their prejudices into arguments from the comfort of their armchairs. The real scientist was the amateur, and the real academy the field - first the zoological gardens, then the jungle. 41 Garner, 1891; Garner, 1892b, quotation on p. 331 of the 1996 reprint. 42 Garner, 1892c, pp. 291-292.</page><page sequence="16">476 GREGORY RADICK The RockefeDler Group's Primate Playbacks, or, Why 1980? Great things were expected from Garner and the primate playback experiment. So what happened? A full account lies outside the remit of this paper. But a brief one should mention two developments, of very different kinds. The first is the scandal that engulfed Garner on his return from Africa in the mid-1890s, when he was accused of having spent virtually no time at all in his famous cage. The second is the rise of new disciplines with jurisdiction over the human-animal boundary - chiefly physical anthropology, cultural anthropology, and comparative psychology. Each of these sciences took shape in ways that made the primate playback experiment almost literally unthinkable. The idea of conducting playback experiments with primates in a sustained and systematic way - that is, of posing the question about an experimental test of meaning in natural primate vocalizations, and devoting time and resources to its prosecution - was simply not one that occurred to most ambitious anthropologists and psychologists in the twentieth century.43 When the idea of the primate playback experiment was again entertained seriously, it was within the context of another distinctly twentieth-century science: ethology. The leading exponents of ethology, in the 1930s and 1940s, struggled to institutionalize their discipline in a world where a rival science, comparative psychology, was already well established. Forced to compete with comparative psychology, the ethologists presented themselves as correcting deficiencies in the reign- ing science of animal behaviour. To a very large extent, the ethologists defined their science against comparative psychology, or, more pre- cisely, against a caricature of that rather heterogeneous science.44 In the doctrine that grew up, it was said that psychologists studied animals in order to understand humans, and so wound up misunderstanding both. 43 An interesting partial exception is Carpenter, working at the boundaries of physi- ology, psychology, and anthropology. As already discussed, in the late 1930s, he did entertain the idea of the primate playback experiment. He did not, however, act on it except in a desultory way, nor did his example inspire anyone else to take it up. He may have been deflected by observations made in Siam, suggesting to him that gibbon calls had functional identities only in context, not in themselves. See Carpenter, 1940, p. 140. For a summary of the disciplinary changes in anthropology and psychology mentioned here, see Radick, 2000b, ch. 5. 44 On the origins and development of ethology, see Burkhardt, 2005. Burkhardt emphasizes that the major contrasts drawn with psychology were two-fold. There were criticisms of comparative psychologists, in the American and behaviorist mode, but also of psychologists who resisted an objective, causal analysis of animal behavior alto- gether.

On the consider- able overlap between ethology and comparative psychology, see Dewsbury, 1992.</page><page sequence="17">PRIMATE LANGUAGE AND THE PLAYBACK EXPERIMENT 477 The rat in the psychologist's maze, the cat in the puzzle-box, the monkey in the choice-chamber: all found themselves acting under conditions of no relevance to their natural lives. Worse, since these animals could only extract themselves from such artificial experimental set-ups through trial-and-error, the psychologist, who never studied animals in nature, concluded that animal behavior, including human behavior, owed nothing to instinct, and everything to trial-and-error learning. The ethologist, it was said, did not make these mistakes. Unlike psychologists, who failed to divest themselves of a human-ori- ented perspective in their studies of animals, ethologists studied animal behaviour on the animals' terms. This disciplinary contrast with psychology lay at the core of the ethological self-conception. One can find it in the programmatic writ- ings of the founders, Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, and also of followers such as William Thorpe, who established ethology at Cambridge.4s More importantly for understanding how the primate playback experiment became thinkable again, the contrast appears in the early writings of Thorpe's first ethological student, Peter Marler.46 In the 1950s Marler worked with Thorpe on an experimental study of song learning in the chaffinch - a study making extensive use of play- back of recorded song (to see, for instance, what restrictions there are on the songs that birds can learn and when they can be learned).47 Independently of Thorpe, Marler also developed an interest in the new information theory and its bearing on understanding animal commu- nication systems. In a major paper on these themes, "The Logical Analysis of Animal Communication" (1961), Marler situated himself within the ethological tradition, and by way of the traditional contrast: Comparative psychologists have neglected the subject of animal communication to a remarkable degree - remarkable, that is, until one reflects on the anthropocentric point of view of most psy- chologists.... The main concern has been to differentiate man and the animals, rather than to determine the properties which their 'languages' may have in common. Dozens of cases could be cited where this prejudice has influenced the questions that are asked, and therefore the answers obtained.... Instead of approaching 45 See, e.g., Tinbergen, 1942, p. 42; Lorenz, 1950, p. 230; Thorpe, 1979, pp. vii-x. 46 On Marler's path to Cambridge, and his life and career generally, see his autobio- graphical essay, Marler, 1985a. 47 Thorpe, 1958.

He had first im- mersed himself in the literature on primate communication before leaving Cambridge, in the course of preparing a long homage to and update of Darwin's work on expression. It appeared in 1959, in a book published as part of the celebrations that year to mark the centenary of the Origin. In primate studies, this was still the era of Carpenter and Solly Zuckerman; the most recent research Marler could find to discuss on communication in primates dated from the 1 920s and 1 930s, when Carpenter, the Yerkes, and the Russian psychologist Nadia Kohts were active.49 Over the next few years, the situation improved rapidly, thanks in large part to one of Marler's senior colleagues at Berkeley, the physical anthropologist Sherwood Washburn. Washburn believed that observation of living pri- mates - apes and monkeys but also hunter-gatherers - would illuminate the Darwinian agencies at work in the hominid past, and to that end started sending his students to Marler for instruction in behavioral zoology en route to their field studies. Soon Marler was caught up in the primatological enthusiasm. At Washburn's invitation, Marler contrib- uted a survey paper on primate communication to a volume on recent field studies of the behavior of apes and monkeys.50 He also started doing and supervising those studies himself, concentrating on the somewhat neglected topic of vocal communication.51 His interest in the vervet alarm calls and their meaning arose at the conjunction of two developments. One was his Ph.D. student Thomas Struhsaker's discovery of the alarm calls, made in the course of observing 48 Marler, 1961, quotations from pp. 296-297. 49 Marler, 1959, pp. 170-171, 202-203. See also Marler, 1985a, p. 330. Marler also (1959, pp. 202-203) discussed Louis Boutan's gibbon research from the 1910s favorably.

Nor did Struhsaker treat the alarm call discoveries as especially interesting. It was Marler, not Struhsaker, who picked them out from among Struhsaker's results and publicized them as bearing on questions of "semanticity," in an important 1967 review article in Science. The vervet alarm calls, Marler here suggested, might be gen- uinely semantic animal signals - might, that is, represent or symbolize leopards or snakes or eagles. "Although the relationships are not specific enough for us to think of the three signals as names for the three types of predators mentioned," he wrote, "in principle, these signals begin to approach the phenomenon of object naming."53 That phrase "object naming" points up the second development behind Marler's new interest: the emergence of a neuroscientific consensus, also in the mid- 1 960s, on the wholly emotional character of vocalizations in nonhuman primates. The difference between humans and the nonhuman primates, it was held, was that humans alone had the cerebral wiring needed to support the easy formation of associations between sights and sounds - the anatomical platform needed to name objects. Naming was thus impossible for apes and monkeys. Indeed, their vocalizations seemed exclusively to be prod- ucts of the brain's emotional seat, the evolutionarily primitive limbic system. The Washburnian anthropologists, as admirers of functional anatomical research, quickly drew the lesson that the vervet predator calls simply could not be predator names, no matter how much the calls looked like names to the behavioral zoologist. Like all other primate vocaliza- tions, the vervet calls were not symbolic, but affective.54 At the Rockefeller, meanwhile, Marler found himself working along- side colleagues, notably the zoologist Donald Griffin, with a bullish atti- tude toward the experimental study of cognition, and little inclined to 52 Struhsaker, 1967, esp. pp. 305-317. For simplicity I have followed the summary in Marler, 1967. The alarm-call taxonomy that Struhsaker presented is somewhat more complicated. Struhsaker's oft-reprinted charts of vocalizations are clearly modelled on Carpenter's. 53 Marler, 1967, pp. 771-772, quotation on p. 772. 54 See Lancaster, 1968 and Marshall, 1970.

In 1972, one of Marler's doctoral students at the Rockefeller, Peter Waser, working in Uganda, successfully conducted playbacks with monkeys in the wild.56 But Waser's research had nothing to do with animal semantics. His concern was with the function, not the meaning, of the calls that echo between groups of mangabeys.57 What drew the various controversies and competencies together into a case for vervet playbacks, around 1975, was the stimulus of another discipline, the old rival to ethology: comparative psychology.58 Starting in the mid- 1 960s, academic psychologists had been engaged in high-profile attempts to teach apes to communicate symboli- cally - the "ape language projects," as they came to be known. In Reno, Allen and Beatrice Gardner were teaching a chimpanzee named Washoe to use sign language. In Santa Barbara, David and Ann Premack were coaching another chimpanzee, Sarah, in the use of a complex system of plastic icons. Throughout the 1970s similar projects sprouted elsewhere, involving chimpanzees but also gorillas and orangutans.59 And in 1975, at the beginning of what would be the period of greatest prominence for the projects, David Premack - their most acute and ambitious theoretician - 55 Griffin's classic 1976 book The Question of Animal Awareness was a manifesto for a new cognitive ethology. See esp. Griffin, 1976, esp. ch. 7, where he called for an experimentally rigorous "participatory investigation of animal communication" (p. 89), and emphasized the likely usefulness of playbacks in such an enterprise (pp. 90-91). Griffin had been airing the book's theses in seminars at the Rockefeller for some time; see Marler, 1985a, p. 338. On Griffin and Marler's role in experiments widely interpreted as vindicating the symbolic nature of the bee dance, see Munz, Journal of the History of Biology 38(3): 535-570 (this issue). 56 Waser, 1975. 57 In 1977, in a long piece written with Richard Tenaza on ape vocalizations as signals, Marler wrote of the promise of field playbacks in the study of functional questions, citing Waser's mangabey research. See Marler and Tenaza, 1977, p. 1029. The dis- tinction I have drawn between function and meaning is, while useful up to a point, not at all clean. Marler wrote from time to time of the "semantic function" of animal calls. 58 The ape language projects do not figure at all in Marler's account of the origins of the vervet playback experiments in his 1985 autobiographical essay, or in Cheney and Seyfarth's account in their 1990 book. See Marler, 1985a, p. 338 and Cheney and Seyfarth, 1990, pp. 102-105. 59 For recent historical surveys of the ape language projects - some of which still continue - see Ristau, 1996 and Wallman, 1992.

See Fouts, 1997, p. 28.</page><page sequence="21">PRIMATE LANGUAGE AND THE PLAYBACK EXPERIMENT 481 stated categorically that non-human animals in the wild do not commu- nicate symbolically. "Man has both affective and symbolic communica- tion," he wrote. "All other species, except when tutored by man... , have only the affective form."60 The combined provocation of the ape-brain anthropologists and the ape-behavior psychologists pushed Marler to confront this skeptical interpretation, and to do so as an ethologist correcting psychological deficiencies. He responded in two ways. First, he started publicizing his doubts about the usefulness of the affect-versus-symbol opposition, especially as a framework for understanding the meanings of primate vocalizations. In Marler's Darwinian view, affective and symbolic signals had to be understood as opposite poles on a continuum, with natural selection determining where along that continuum a particular signal sits. The question, then, was not whether vervet alarm calls might be wholly symbolic, but whether they might not be wholly affective, in ways that experimental study could establish.6' Second, he arranged for two postdocs - an American husband-and-wife team, educated, like him, in Cambridge ethology - to use playbacks to test for semanticity in the alarm calls of Amboseli vervets. Until they joined Marler's labo- ratory, Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney had known little about vocal communication and its study. Their expertise was as observers and theorists of social behaviour in baboons; and when they left for Amboseli in spring 1977, they were much more excited about the prospects of using the playback technique to explore vervet-vervet relationships than vervet-environment ones. Once in the field, however, they found the alarm call behavior utterly absorbing. By the time 60 Premack, 1975, p. 593. 61 See Marler, 1977. For Marler's discussions with Premack about this subject, see p. 229 of the 1980 reprint. A somewhat different version appeared as Marler, 1978. In The Question of Animal Awareness, Donald Griffin referred readers to Premack's and Marler's recent writings, commenting: "much animal communication conveys an emotional or affective state, such as fear. Except for the dances of honeybees, and the sign language recently taught to captive chimpanzees, it is difficult to judge from available data whether animal communication behavior also includes specific infor- mation about the nature of the object or situation responsible for the emotional state conveyed. But rather than assuming the absence of such information a priori, it seems advisable to consider this an open question to be investigated" (Griffin, 1976, p. 98).</page><page sequence="22">482 GREGORY RADICK Marler came out to Amboseli in the summer of that year to help with the first playback trials, Seyfarth and Cheney were hooked.62 Between 1975, when Seyfarth and Cheney first contacted Marler, and 1980, when their playback research was published, the ape language projects enjoyed their greatest popular cachet. Not since Garner's day had the topics of animal-human communication and the evolutionary origins of language commanded so much scientific and journalistic attention.63 The excitement was well captured in books of earnest reportage such as Eugene Linden's Apes, Men, and Language (1974) and Adrian Desmond's The Ape's Reflexion (1979).64 The project psychol- ogists had always had their critics, of course. In 1980, however, the criticisms started to look fatal, thanks to the recent recantations of one of the project psychologists, Herbert Terrace at Columbia. He had concluded that his sign-tutored chimpanzee, Neam ("Nim") Chimpsky, had not in fact learned to communicate symbolically, but had merely succeeded at imitating the signs of his teachers.65 In March 1980, Time asked "Are Those Apes Really Talking?" In May, the New Yorker ran a typically amused item on a conference devoted to excoriating the project psychologists as hapless victims of "Clever Hans" anthropomorphism. "The tone," it was reported, was well "summed up by a participant who said 'the tide had turned' against the ape-language studies."66 It was against this backdrop of disillusion with and disarray among the psychological tutors of apes that the Rockefeller group's papers became so celebrated. In their scientific papers, the group drew the contrast between the ape language projects and the vervet playback experiments explicitly.67 It was most vivid, however, in a popular article published a little later by Seyfarth, "Talking with Monkeys and Great Apes." After discussing the apparently endless 62 This account draws partly on my interviews with Marler, Cheney, and Seyfarth, partly on my reading of Seyfarth and Cheney's scientific papers from the era, and partly on unpublished letters and research proposals in Peter Marler's collection of personal papers, presently stored in his office at the University of California at Davis.

We argue that animals in the ape language projects have been brought into a human world, taught a human sort of communication and been tested in human terms. Given the fact that few Americans, for example, would perform to the best of their ability if quizzed, say, in Nepalese, the design of the ape language projects may have led researchers to underestimate the natural abilities of their subjects. Why not, then, try to enter the monkeys' and apes' habitats, learn their systems of communication and evaluate their abilities on their own terms?... [Our] results gave us convincing proof that monkeys in the wild could do at least some of the things that had previously been done only by apes in the laboratory. It seemed clear that if we were patient enough, and designed our experiments correctly, we could get the animals to tell us how they communicate with each other, and we could do this without teaching, in an environment where the monkeys were free to choose their own method of communication and topics of conversation. 68 Conclusions The history of the sciences is the history of certain questions coming to be asked and, sometimes, answered. A major task for historians is to reconstruct the conditions which gave life to questions, making them real, compelling, irresistible, for a community of enquirers - and per- haps the wider world - at a particular time and place. A connected task is to understand how once-live questions lost their vitality. To say this is hardly novel. Two of the most historically-minded philosophers of the sciences in our time, Nicholas Jardine and Ian Hacking, have raised just this question about questions.69 And yet, surprisingly few historical works address it squarely. A meta-question lurks here, about the con- ditions under which historians take seriously the questions scientists 68 Seyfarth, 1982, pp. 15, 18.

It has used the long-run of scientific studies of non-human primate communication to show how unobvious was an apparently simple idea: that to find out what primate vocalizations mean, one should record them, play the recordings back to the animals, and watch what happens. The question of what would be revealed through playbacks with non-human primates only became an obvious one to pursue, in a focused and persistent way, under highly particular circumstances. The curious twist in this tale, of course, is that this happened twice, in the latter parts of different centuries. When we consider the experiment's nineteenth-century invention, it looks at first blush as if the mere existence of the improved phonograph was sufficient to prompt its use in the experimental study of animal language. Garner invented the primate playback experiment almost as soon as it became technically possible. He did so, however, not as a phonograph buff looking for new ways of applying the talking machine, but as an evolutionist searching for a better means of translating the utterances of monkeys. The key to Garner's innovation lies, as we have seen, with his engagement in the then-simmering debate over language as fatal to the evolutionary theory. His own, decidedly non-elite understanding of that theory also matters; a more subtly Darwinian thinker might have been less confident that, in an evolved world, simians must be found speaking a tongue slightly more primitive than the tongue of the most savage humans. We should note too Garner's animus toward the academy. In travelling with cage and phonograph to the French Congo, he presented himself as the true scientist, willing to take the intellectual and physical risks before which the so-called pro- fessionals trembled. For the twentieth-century reinvention of the experiment, of course, none of the above holds. The basic hardware had been around since Garner's day, improving steadily, and even, from time to time, used for recording and playing back the vocalizations of primates. Evolutionary theory had become imperturbably secure and, after the Second World War, dissociated from old ideas of racial hierarchy. Furthermore, there were now professional scientists, ethologists, who made a habit of sometimes demanding field studies of the natural behavior patterns of animals. What brought the primate playback experiment back into existence, above all, was the flaring up of a disciplinary antagonism around an ethologist with a unique cluster of interests: in the learning of birdsong, studied in the lab with experimental playbacks; in primate vocalizations, studied in the field; and in the characterization of animal signals as bearers of information or meaning. No-one but an ethologist could have made a career in these areas. And no-one was quite as prone</page><page sequence="25">PRIMATE LANGUAGE AND THE PLAYBACK EXPERIMENT 485 as an ethologist to criticize psychologists for studying animal behavior on human rather than animal terms. The psychological ape-language tutoring projects that flourished from the late-1960s to the late-1970s found their comeuppance in the vervet alarm call experiments that Marler assigned to Cheney and Seyfarth.70 So twice, following two quite different paths, history generated the primate playback experiment. To what should we attribute such robustness?71 Maybe nothing. Maybe things just turned out that way, and there is nothing more general to say or explain. Such explanatory minimalism, or maybe nihilism, recommends itself on several counts. It is cleanly intelligible. It requires no extra work on the part of the his- torian. And it conforms to recent trends in science historiography, where the signature tone is relentlessly contingentist. All scientific debates are discussed as if they could have gone any which way at any given moment, but for the accidents of human character and position. The conclusions agreed upon as to what is true, and the courses of action taken to find out what is true, are presented as in the end inseparable from the vagaries of social history. The implication, of course, is that different social matrices would have brought about dif- ferent conclusions and different courses of action. Nothing in science is inevitable. The fact that the primate playback experiment came around twice, independently, does not show that the experiment was bound to happen, given a certain level of technical sophistication and enough people committed to learning about the natural vocalizations of ani- mals. It shows only, once again, that science is a social construction, if sometimes with weird contours. Certainly the history of the primate playback experiment is rich in contingency. Most conspicuous are the events conspiring to drive the experiment to the margins for nearly a century, despite huge positive publicity. A tantalizing possibility is that, if Garner had returned from Africa with phonographic evidence of language-like abilities in the apes, there might never have arisen a comparative psychology for ethology to define itself against. The English psychologist C. Lloyd 70 It should also be noted that ethology from its earliest days was a technophile science, enthusiastically partnered to movie cameras and other recording and detection devices, and to that extent as well a natural disciplinary setting for the primate playback experiment. On ethological technophilia, see Mitman, 1999, ch. 3. 71 In what follows I explore some themes developed in complementary ways in Radick, 2003b; Radick, 2005; and Radick, in press (b). In conversation, Bob Batterman sug- gested that the question I am groping toward here might be usefully reformulated in the language of complexity theory, as whether or not the primate playback experiment is an attractor in the space of possibilities for the scientific study of animal communication.</page><page sequence="26">486 GREGORY RADICK Morgan had announced himself, in 1893, quite prepared to drop his arguments for a presumption of trial-and-error learning in animals if presented with such evidence. He was not, and comparative psychology grew up in the shadow of his stern rule of inference, known as Mor- gan's canon.2 Then there is the complex counterpoint of developments in the ape language projects and in Marler's immediate sphere. It is easy enough to imagine the Struhsaker alarm call observations remaining forever on Marler's "to do" list without Premack's provo- cation, or to imagine the results of the alarm call experiments getting little attention outside a small circle of ethologists and primatologists. And so on. It is not difficult to multiply counterfactuals in a similar spirit. Yet what distinguishes the history recounted here are less the elements that lend themselves to a contingentist reading than the ele- ments that do not. Consider a striking contrast in rationale between the 1890 and 1980 instantiations of the experiment. Something absolutely fundamental to Garner's self-conception had no place whatsoever in the later work: namely, that playback experiments needed doing because, if evolution was true, the world ought to contain animals with human-like language and humans with animal-like language. By the time of the vervet playbacks, the consensus opinion, virtually unchallenged and perhaps, now, unchallengable, was that all human languages are equal in their complexity. None are more animal-like than any other. So while the Rockefeller group believed in gradual evolution no less firmly than Garner did, they in no way saw themselves as demonstrating the exis- tence of a predicted hierarchy in nature. For them, if anything, evolu- tionary considerations took an anti-hierarchical form. Marler wrote of how amazing it would be if the capacities for symbolic communication in the ape mind, on which the successes of the ape language psycholo- gists depended, went unused in the course of the animals' natural, autonomous lives, but only emerged under a human-imposed tutoring regime.73 If this does not amount to a straightforward reversal of Garner's rationale (whatever such a thing would be), it is both clearly evolutionist, indeed adaptationist, and free of even a whiff of natural hierarchy upheld. And while the scientific racism of the later nineteenth century - what we might call its evolutionary politics - did not disap- pear in the twentieth century, it did become officially unwelcome, and increasingly so, not least among professional biologists in the United States.74 72 See Radick, 2000a. 73 See, e.g., Marler, 1985b, p. 505. 74 See, e.g., the latter chapters of Ruse, 1996.</page><page sequence="27">PRIMATE LANGUAGE AND THE PLAYBACK EXPERIMENT 487 The primate playback experiment appears, then, to have been invented with one evolutionary politics in mind and reinvented with an opposite one in mind. It first arose against the backdrop of an unar- guably hierarchical evolutionary theory, and arose a second time against the backdrop of an arguably anti-hierachical evolutionary theory. Two quite different social histories, in other words, produced roughly the same conclusions about what is true and about how to find it out. In this important respect, the experiment seems independent of a certain kind of social-scientific determinant. That does not mean, of course, that Garner's context and the Rockefeller group's context had nothing relevant in common - that the conditions which prompted Garner's question were totally unlike the ones that prompted Marler's. Around 1890 and 1980, the animal origins of language had become hugely controversial. At both times, there was a feeling that haughty scientists were underestimating the natural abilities of non-human primates. And at both times, the conducting of a field experiment brought with it an unbeatable combination of moral and epistemic authority: the authority of experiment over observation or speculation; and the authority of nature over artifice.75 But even granting these similarities, the difference in evolutionary politics deserves reflection, on three counts. It raises the question of how, exactly, the mainstream theory of evolution ever came to lose its prediction of racial hierarchy. It reminds us that contingentism in the history of the sciences is to be shown, not presumed. Finally, it shows that the choice between contingentism and inevitabilism about the sciences is not the sterile, evidence-free choice it is sometimes despairingly thought to be. The facts of history can be used, if not to decide the issue, then at least to make it less dichotomous, by helping us see concretely how a scientific conclusion or method might be neither completely independent of its historical context nor completely inseparable from it.
