<plain_text><page sequence="1">A lengthy Introduction provides amplification. Its first part ('Problems, methods and goals') begins with a definition of a portrait (as a recognisable image) and warns against emotional responses. Methods will include stylistic and also structural analysis (as though the piece were an abstract solid). Discussion then embraces types, functions (including funerary), commissions (some perhaps spontaneously by local communities), the different values of imperial portraits (usually provided by copyists) and private (executed by an artist from the sitter) to the art historian, and the intention to concentrate on those portraits created in the area of Rome, the artistic capital, so as to try to define trends and individual artistic personalities, as is done regularly for Greek or Renaissance art, but rarely for Roman (a reflection of the low esteem in which the Romans themselves held artists). The second part comprises an admirably clear review of scholarly literature on third-century art (to which students could usefully be directed) (pp. 11-25): it incorporates an assessment of the role of Plotinus and neoplatonist thought, and considers that inward ('inner-directed') factors (i.e. an inner momentum) should be regarded as more important than outward (' other-directed'), such as political propaganda, as an explanation of the period's rapid stylistic changes. The first chapter discusses 'one connecting thread' throughout: the influence of Caracalla's images, and of the 'Caracalla master' identified by S. Nodelman, with X-shaped slashes across the face, producing emotionality. Caracalla, although unlikable in many respects, did keep his popularity with the army, and so his image provided a useful reference for his successors. So an unbroken chain of descent can be traced down to the first portrait type of Gallienus (p. 48). A second chapter treats the classicism of the late Severans for two decades after Caracalla, a third the soldier-emperors, who used and transformed the Caracalla image in 'veristic' and 'impressionistic' ways, a fourth the extremely significant rise from the A.D. 240s and 250s onwards of a more abstract style, and a fifth the Gallienic ' renaissance', a time of complex visual references (many to the past, such as to Augustus and Hadrian), and also of further stylistic development and an increasing abstraction which looked forward to Tetrarchic and Constantinian art. A chapter of 'Conclusions' finds that the period produced 'many intelligent and imaginative artists' who responded to the needs of their rapidly changing society (p. 121). Within the limits which W. realises are set by the basic difficulty of studying this period of portraiture -- identification - an excellent job has been done. W. fully understands the complexities of ancient art production and this period, and has produced a lucid and readable study which should inspire further work from its largely original art-historical standpoint.

That magnificent international enterprise, the Corpus of Sculpture of the Roman World (CSIR), here receives a worthy addition with a well-illustrated volume which collects 109 sculptured items, many previously unpublished, from Roman military and civilian sites within what is now Wales, where the National Museum backed the project. An Introduction notes that 'sculpture is quite sparsely represented' in Wales (compared with other regions of Roman Britain), and discusses distribution, material (British stones, apart from marble for one Trajanic building inscription), stylistic considerations (generally low quality, and either 'provincial', 'immigrant' or 'Celtic' in character), and dating. Catalogue arrangement is by categories, namely: (1) deities and personifications, a Graeco-Roman (including Fortuna, Bonus Eventus, Genius, Medusa, Mercury, Salus and Mars), b Romano-Celtic (Mars Lenus, a mother goddess and a warrior god), (2) funerary monuments (including reliefs of Attis and Venus), (3) building records, (4) altars, (5) bronze statuary (notably fragments of armoured statues), (6) unidentified anthropomorphic figures, (7) animals, (8) architectural carvings (including a large number from Caerwent, Venta Silurum), (9) miscellaneous sculpture, (10) incerta, falsa et aliena.

WAYWELL: The Lever and Hope Sculptures. Ancient Sculptures in the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight and a Catalogue of the Ancient Sculptures Formerly in the Hope Collection, London and Deepdene. (Monumenta artis Romanae, 16.) Pp. 130; 68 plates, 36 figures. Berlin: Mann, 1986. DM 80. W. H. Lever, later Lord Leverhulme, began the model village of Port Sunlight in 1889, to house the workers in his Merseyside factory. He was also a collector of works of art; and in 1913 he conceived the idea of the Lady Lever Art Gallery (opened in 1922, the year of his peerage), to house these and to be a dominant feature and cultural centre in the attractive place which still exists much as he left it. The Gallery is now maintained by the Merseyside County Council. Lever's purchases of classical antiquities were made between 1905 and 1921, the most important in 1917 when he was already buying for the Gallery rather than himself. In that year he bought, among other things, fourteen pieces of sculpture and thirty-five vases (not, as Waywell says, more than sixty) at the sale of the Hope Collection. This had been formed by Thomas Hope, mainly in the years around 1800 though both he and his son added to it later, and was among the most important and influential of the great private collections of classical antiquities in nineteenth-century Britain. The vases were admirably catalogued, before their dispersal, by E. M. W. Tillyard, but there has never been any complete account of the sculptures. When Waywell was invited to catalogue the Lever sculptures he was already working with Dr Oehler on the preparation of catalogues for a new series on ancient sculptures surviving in English private collections; and it was decided to combine the Lever catalogue with a reconstruction, so far as that is possible, of the Hope Collection. The resulting volume is wholly admirable. The resources and standards of Monumenta artis Romanae have ensured an exceptional level of production, and the excellent new photographs of R. Laev are well reproduced. Waywell's book on the free-standing figures from the Mausoleum established him as one of the best scholars now working on Greek sculpture. The material of the present volume offers problems of a different kind, but he shows equal mastery here. Of thirty marbles catalogued in Port Sunlight, seven are seventeenth- or eighteenth-century copies of Roman imperial portrait- busts, and three other pieces are considered of doubtful antiquity. The twenty antiques (statues, statuettes, heads and decorative objects) are all Roman imperial works and most of them are more or less heavily restored and worked over. The further hundred or so catalogued from the Hope collection are of similar character. There are intrinsically important pieces, for example the Hope/Lever Antinous, but overall they are perhaps of greatest interest for the history of neo- classical taste. Thomas Hope himself intended his collection to be a formative influence on public taste, and took great pains over its display, first in London and after 1824 in his country house, the Deepdene, near Dorking in Surrey. Waywell has been at no less pains to reconstruct these displays, and the result is a fascinating study. He illustrates many old engravings both of individual pieces and of views in the two houses, and also reconstructed plans showing the dispositions. He also does his best to trace the later history of the sculptures, recording where he can their present situation; but more than half the statues and heads, and more than three quarters of the decorative pieces (urns, candelabra and the rest) have gone missing. Seven terracotta statuettes in Port Sunlight (none of them from the Hope collection) are catalogued by Reynold Higgins. Two of them are genuine, the other five forgeries. The seventy- five vases at present in the Lady Lever Art Gallery are the subject of a separate catalogue by the reviewer (1987). Cambridge MARTIN ROBERTSON 0009-840X/88 $3.00 ?
