Since the design world began to take a renewed interest in environmental issues in the mid- to late 198os there has been a steady stream of books, articles, and conference papers on the subject. Initially, the urgent demand for immedi- ate information produced a number of how-to-do-it books which tended to present green design in a fairly unprob- lematic way, or at least reflected the general belief at the time among manu- facturers, consumers, and designers that environmental issues were a relat- ively straightforward matter. Since then Journal of Design History Vol. 7 No. 4 ? 1994 The Design History Society 301</page><page sequence="2">designers and others have become increasingly aware of the complexity of green issues and the difficulties of incor- porating an ecological perspective into design and industry. This is partly due to the experience of the practical dif- ficulties of developing truly green products. For example, an apparently objective method like Life Cycle Assess- ment, which has been applied to Eco- labelling, has shown that environmental choices are far from simple and that ultimately they are ethical choices. Related to this is the recognition that there needs to be a far greater subtlety at the theoretical or historical, as well as methodological, level. Thus in the last few years there has been much greater reference to the relationship between the environment and social, political, and cultural developments, as well as the related fields of environmental cog- nition and perception. The four books reviewed here reflect such recent think- ing in different ways. Three of them quite explicitly argue that the environ- ment is a cultural construction, that it should not be seen as a separate physical entity, divorced from all the other aspects of human intellectual, social, and cultural developments. The fourth book-by Nigel Whiteley-also implies this by subsuming eco-design under 'design for society' alongside socially responsible design and con- sumption, and feminist perspectives. Such an emphasis gives a new reson- ance and importance to history, theory, and philosophy which was lacking in the green design debate of the 198os. It also underlines the interdisciplinary (or postdisciplinary according to Tony Fry) nature of this subject. The classification categories of these books reflect their multidisciplinary nature. For example, Ian Simmons' book spans environment/ geography/cultural studies/philosophy/ politics, and Tony Fry's covers economic development-environmental aspects/environmental policy-and eco- nomic aspects/sustainable develop- ment. It is therefore appropriate to review two books on design alongside two books concerned with the more general cultural and political dimen- sions of the subject. In addition, the four books also approach the subject from different viewpoints and disciplines: design history, design theory, political science, geography/environmental sci- ence; they also come from different parts of the world: the United States (Ferkiss), the United Kingdom (White- ley, Simmons), and Australia (Fry); they thus afford the opportunity to discuss the different dimensions of the current literature on ecology and eco-design, a good corrective to the somewhat one- dimensional picture of 'green design' which emerged in the 198os. Because Nigel Whiteley's starting- point is the shift of values that took place in design in the late 198os and early 199os, he discusses green design in a wider context than books on the subject published in 1989-90. Design for Society is therefore not about eco-design per se but about one of the important elements in a newly emerging definition or ethic of design. In this respect it resembles Victor Papanek's Design for the Real World, published twenty-two years ago (to which Nigel Whiteley pays homage), in that it discusses the envi- ronmental implications of design as part of a far broader critique of the role of design in a consumer society. There is patchy coverage of some areas dealt with by Papanek in more depth. For example, 'Third World problems and priorities' is discussed in only three pages, hardly room to scrape the surface of all the issues and complexities of this topic. But this is perhaps inevitable in such a short book covering such a wide area. But Papanek's own ideas and influence are usefully discussed in Design for Society in the context of the subsequent development of 'socially useful' products. Social usefulness is a central theme of Nigel Whiteley's book and its title was consciously chosen both to give this resonance and as an intentional rejoin- der to Gordon Lippincott's book Design for Business, which was published in 1947 as a eulogy of consumerist values. Whiteley makes it clear that he starts out from a diametrically opposite posi- tion: Designers can no longer take refuge from responsibility for their own actions and continually repackage the same old type of consumer goods at a time when issues about consuming and its relationship to the world's resources and energy need urgently to be acted upon. (p. 3) Like Papanek's Design for the Real World, Design for Society starts with a critique of the history and practice of consumer-led design and goes on to outline the altern- atives: Green Design, Responsible Design and Ethical Consuming and Feminist Perspectives. These titles ref- lect the kind of self-questioning going on within the design profession in the last five years, the growing disenchant- ment with design which followed on from the 'bursting of the 8os design bubble'. Whiteley gives a round-up of this reassessment by designers at the turn of the 198os/199os, who attacked design as irresponsible and trivial. He then traces this essentially limited inter- pretation of design back to its origins in the 1950S and 196os, particularly to America, in the context of theories about the 'dynamic economy' and con- sumer-led economic growth in that period. There is an implied link between that earlier period and the 198os because the latter is discussed under the heading 'Private affluence and public squalor', a famous quotation from J. K. Galbraith's The Affluent Society of 1958. However, this parallel between market revivalism in the United States in the immediate post-war period and that of Thatcher and Reagan in the late 1970S and 198os is hinted at rather than fully discussed. This is rather disappointing and, in fact, what is lacking in White- ley's text is a historical analysis of the underlying political and economic bases for the emergence of the particular 'paradigm' of design under attack. Whiteley frequently emphasizes the fact that green or socially responsible design reflects a whole new set of economic, political and social values. For example, he says: Green politics have shown us that design is not a simple matter of personal choice and preference, but a complex issue with interlocking human, social, political and environmental dimensions . . . against this complexity, marketing-led design looks increasingly shallow and irresponsible. (P. 93) But the economic and political context of the reaction is sketchy. For example, 302 Journal of Design History Vol. 7 No. 4 ? 1994 The Design History Society</page><page sequence="3">there is little reference to the 'new' or 'green' economics which underlies the development of new/ethical consumer- ism on which Design for Society is largely based. For the green movement alter- native modes of consumption are only one, short-term, strategy, one possible option in a market economy which has marginalized other forms of direct participatory democracy, and not an alternative to a longer-term agenda for more radical change. Although Nigel Whiteley recognizes the vital need for political change and gives a balanced account of different green and other political strategies in relation to design, his conclusions seem politically ambig- uous. For example, after making use of a lot of hard-hitting arguments through- out the book against the current design status quo he appears in the end to draw back from the full implications of these and argue that the book is certainly not anti-design, nor anti-consumerist and proposes no drastic reconstruction of society. Thus, although this is the first book to discuss a new radical approach to design, for me this was rather spoiled by the politically cautious approach. However, it is a very good summary of the current social, ecological, and femin- ist critiques of design and makes a valuable contribution to the current debate over design in the 199os. It will prove an invaluable source for students and tutors as well as designers. One of the characteristics of the environmental debate in recent years has been the clear emergence of different political perspectives within the green movement, variously descri- bed as 'dark' and 'light' green or 'deep' and 'shallow' ecology. These distinc- tions are discussed in Nigel Whiteley's book but Tony Fry reflects them in a different way, because he is writing from a more self-consciously radical position. His ideas can be related both to deep ecology and to the convergence of left/Marxist views with environment- alism: so-called green Marxism or eco- socialism. His book is the first really to discuss design in such a context and is therefore inevitably highly theoretical in nature, although paradoxically he is actually closer to the practice of eco- design than Nigel Whiteley, being a member of the Sydney-based Eco- Design Foundation, and having recently participated in the exhibition 'Green Desires: Ecology, Design, Products'. The title of his book, Remakings, is intended to imply the deliberately exploratory nature of the writings col- lected here-it consists of nine recent articles or conference papers slightly edited for publication, including 'Against an essentialist theory of need', 'Desire and the desired', 'Conservation of the artificial', and 'Sacred Design II'. The essays are informed by recent writ- ings on design, economics, environ- mental theory, politics, and philosophy and the discussion spans a variety of subjects: desire, need, economy, con- sumption, ethics, community, educa- tion, policy, design, craft, architecture, and the artificial, with an underlying focus on eco-design, its meaning, nature, and practice. The format makes for a sometimes repetitive and rather disconnected book and the texts, as the author freely admits, are not easy read- ing. But perhaps this is inevitable in the kind of writing that is concerned with 'deconstructive practice in action-a practice that can dismantle in order to open a place for other arrivals' (After- word). The writing is a mixture of annoying obscurantisms and perceptive insights, but it contains a well-argued case against the current design status quo and the 'industrial paradigm' on which it is based. The basic argument is set out in the introduction and then fol- lowed up in the subsquent articles in different ways. Like some of the early ecological writings of the 1970s Tony Fry emphasizes the social and cultural origins of the global environmental crisis. The crisis is not just the result of specific physical environmental prob- lems such as pollution, but has been caused by humans through their indus- trial culture, their whole system of values. He argues that a 'transformed industrial culture is essential for our bio-social survival'. This is a matter of changing basic values, and can only be achieved by design. The book therefore seeks to show that: the value of ecodesign ... could be judged by the quality of its ability to deliver a made artificial that could sustain both itself and socio-biodiversity. Ecodesigning, therefore, might mean designing against design, as much as a new designing, be it of systems, processes or objects. (p. 20) This analysis is based on a postmodern reading of environmental ethics which suggests that nature is not a separate entity but is mediated by the cultural, the 'naturalized artificial'. Fry is critical of mainstream environmentalism for having failed to understand this, argu- ing that it is 'under-informed by contemporary post-structural and deconstructive theory'. Thus much popular environmental literature is based on a positivistic, scientific belief in facts which is culturally crude, and this underlies evironmental policy and green politics as well as eco-design theory and practice. Fry dismisses the latter as reformist and pragmatic, describing, for example, Dorothy Mac- kenzie's Green Design as the best book on the subject but typically limited because it fails to recognize the need to transform consumer culture: it is con- cerned with the reconstruction of exist- ing design practice as opposed to the 'eco-logical task of deconstruction'. This is an interesting and convincing argument but there are certain incon- sistencies and contradictions. For exam- ple, the pretext for the book is the perceived 'eco-crisis' and the urgent need for change, but the whole tenor of the book seems to preclude action since it criticizes virtually all existing modes of environmental action as inadequate, partial, or reformist. But then, para- doxically, Tony Fry puts forward a pro- gramme for eco-design which is linked to DES (Developing Ecological Sustain- ability) which includes many familiar practical measures which sound remar- kably reformist alongside some more long-term abstract intellectual strate- gies. The mode of practice posited in the book is overwhelmingly theoretical: rethinking or deconstruction as a strategy based on a belief in the 'post- foundational' thinking of 'applied Hei- degger', so that categories such as 'environment' or 'nature' or 'need' are not fixed but are culturally defined (and redefined). But this is problematic, too, since it seems to undermine the very existence of an objective ecological or environmental crisis which underpins Journal of Design History Vol. 7 No. 4 ? 1994 The Design History Society 303</page><page sequence="4">the whole discussion, and is the starting-point for this collection of essays. Tony Fry's answer would pre- sumably be that conceptual remaking is an urgent prerequisite for action: for example, the simplistic notion of need which underpinned the 'Design for Need' movement of the 1970S tended to invalidate it and now, in the wake of recent post-structuralist and deep ecol- ogy theories, we can begin to develop a non-anthropocentric framework for needs, an ecological context for judging wants, desires, needs, and the con- sumption of resources. This is all very interesting and the arguments are per- suasive but I am still left wondering how they can be translated into action, how the kind of urgent change that is identified by Fry and others writing on the subject can occur. One of the heal- thy developments within the green movement since the mid-198os, in my view, has been a renewed emphasis on poverty and social justice, both within affluent and poor countries, in the wake of eco-socialism. But it is healthy pre- cisely because it is leading to a new activism and is reflected in green politi- cal programmes and campaigns. But then perhaps the new eco-design the- ory/paradigm that is beginning to emerge in these writings by Tony Fry will eventually lead to a new eco-design praxis, too-it certainly presents a radi- cal challenge to existing concepts of design and eco-design. The range of theory and practice within the contemporary green move- ment is given full coverage in Victor Ferkiss' book Nature, Technology and Society and, in that respect, it helps to situate the two books so far discussed within the current environmental de- bate. Although Ferkiss' own commit- ment to deep ecological values is quite clear, he sets out to indicate the range of conflicting attitudes of contemporary thinkers on the issue of the relationship between humans and nature and tech- nology, covering eco-feminism and eco- theology as well as deep ecology and green political activism. Lately there has been a spate of books on green politics and green political theory which cover this same spectrum but Ferkiss places more emphasis on history, that is intel- lectual history. The main part of his book is concerned with the historical roots of our current environmental crisis, via an account of the cultural and intellectual origins of the attitudes to nature and technology that have created our modern technological society. This includes Western civilizations, Classi- cal, Medieval, Renaissance, as well as Islam, the Orient and different eco- logical/political systems of thought: industrialism, Marxism, and Nazism. This part of the book is informative and interesting but the format is a bit restric- tive: each period is systematically covered with a section on nature and then a section on technology. The narrative is therefore rather compart- mentalized and fragmented, which ref- lects a Western academic mode of thinking of the type that Ferkiss is trying to escape from. Thus in the first part of the book the argument unfolds slowly and in a rather haphazard way, in contrast to the more coherent, structured second half. But there are many links between the two halves of the book and together they reinforce the basic message that environmental prob- lems are also cultural problems. There are many new insights and valuable observations in the historical survey- Ferkiss dispels some green myths, questioning, for example, the degree of Thoreau's actual self-sufficiency in Walden, and the extent to which Native Americans can legitimately be viewed as precursors of modern-day environ- mentalists: they were not so much anti- technology as pre-technological, he argues. As these examples show, because this is an American book, there is special emphasis on America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which distinguishes the book from other recent studies of green thought and environmentalism. The other new emphasis in Victor Ferkiss's book is on the design-related area of technology. Having investigated the relations between humans and technology/nature in different periods and cultures, he comes to the conclusion that the drive to conquer nature through technology is petty universal, but he also underlines the importance of questioning technlogy and technology choice. In many ways the book is an updated version of Mumford, who became something of a hero for the environmental movement in the late 1960os and 1970s. Lewis Mumford is himself discussed as one of the contem- porary critics of technology and one of the values of Ferkiss' book is that it reintroduces the debate over the politics and social ethics of technology which was a key theme of the 1970os but seemed to get lost in the 198os. One of the key themes in the green debate over technology and culture, dating back to the 196os, concerns the origins of the 'mechanistic paradigm', the split between humans and nature which originated in the Medieval era but became fully established in Cartesian logic. It is still widely believed by ecological thinkers that this Western world-view which enshrines certain anti-ecological values is responsible for our current ecological crisis, and in the second part of his book Victor Ferkiss looks at the various attempts at rethink- ing the mechanistic paradigm. Discus- sions of deep ecology and eco-feminism raise fundamental issues such as those of anthropomorphism versus biomor- phism, the value which should be attached to human needs and perspec- tives. This is linked back to the historical section of the book where some precur- sors of modern green thinking are discus- sed. Ferkiss' book as a whole contains an enormous amount of informative mater- ial and full references and bibliography and it is therefore an extremely good introduction to the history of environ- mental thought. It goes beyond a mere compilation of information to argue, like Fry and Whiteley, for the need for a basic change in values, a revolution in our out- look on life: a 'metanoia' from the radical individualism of modern industrial society to greater commitment to com- munity, to downplaying economic growth and rethinking our place in nature. The changes needed are not so much scientific or technological as cultu- ral and ethical: Almost everyone throughout the civilized world pays lip service to the environment today, but not all are realizing the extent of the change in attitudes and behaviour necessary to save the planet. An earlier book by I. G. Simmons, Changing the Face of the Earth, was a 304 Journal of Design History Vol. 7 No. 4 ? 1994 The Design History Society</page><page sequence="5">history of the interaction between humans and the environment in some ways parallel to the book by Victor Ferkiss, but more ecological or geo- graphical in emphasis. In that book Simmons cautioned, as Ferkiss does, that what he wrote was inevitably based on a Western perspective or mode of thinking. However, critics tended to ignore this disclaimer and the book was criticized for its over-empirical, materi- alist approach. The recent book by I. G. Simmons, Interpreting Nature, was writ- ten as a response to what the author himself thought was wrong with his earlier book. Changing the Face of the Earth was based on the false notion that the environment consisted of observ- able facts; it took facts at their face value. But 'facts', Simmons now argues, were the cultural filters through which the information had come: the environ- ment was a cultural construction. These ideas were raised in Changing the Face of the Earth where, in the introduction, Simmons reviewed different attitudes to the environment from a historical and methodological point of view. Now these ideas are developed further in Interpreting Nature which discusses the full range of environmental construc- tions, from the materialist inter- pretations of the so-called 'objective' human sciences-economics, positivist social science, and the natural sciences-through to the normative constructions of the behavioural sciences which explore value systems and raise issues of environmental ethics. This is a comprehensive survey which summarizes an enormous amount of material and covers the full range of the current environmental debate including environmental policy/management, and environmental philosophy/cognition; theology and ethics, including non- Western religions; phenomenology and post-structuralism (including the envi- ronment-related aspects of 'applied Heidegger', and Derrida and decon- structionism, which relate back to Tony Fry's arguments); feminist perspectives on ecology; deep ecology and green political thought; and the arts and the environment, including painting, poetry, literature, and photography. The text, notes, and bibliography makes this book an extremely useful one, but the enormous range of the subject matter inevitably leads to a rather summary treatment of some issues. For example, photography, TV, architecture, and gardens are each covered in only one page and, although these topics are not central to the book, this is obviously inadequate. In fact, the structure of the book betrays its origins as an under- graduate course on environmental thought which was intended to per- suade geography students or students of environmental science that their thinking about the environment had to go beyond a linear model to consider the deeper cultural frameworks in which environmental science was embedded. Thus the format is rather too much of a textbook; even so, it should also be helpful to design or design history students seeking to understand the intellectual history of environmentalism and the current range of environmental thinking as a basis or background for understanding eco-design. But more significantly Simmons' book can lead to a better understanding of what ecology has meant and means. Although the book is not a history of environmental constructions as such, it contains some very interesting obser- vations on history in passing. For example, Simmons refers to the way in which ecology, after about a century of existing as a minor branch of biology, was propelled into the limelight in the 196os and 197os and became a fashion- able subject and a cult phenomenon. This caused problems because ecol- ogists were suddenly called upon to operate in a socio-political sphere and asked to provide evidence to back up different positions in the environmental debate. Thus ecology moved from being seen as a science to become involved in a cultural or ethical critique of contem- porary industrial society and Simmons discusses the problems inherent in this transition. It raised difficulties over the nature of scientific evidence because the long-term nature of ecological and climatological research could not furnish the hard and fast evidence called for by environmentalists and policy- makers. But there were/are also dif- ficulties in using ecology as a model for environmental ethics. The danger is that reading off moral or ethical tenets from the natural world might simply mean projecting on to nature what we wish to believe. Another problem lies in the belief that ecology is something fixed whereas the findings and methods of ecological science are constantly chang- ing. For instance, there has been a shift from classical models of systems tending towards equilibrium towards more dynamic interpretations of unpre- dictable chaos-like successions. Sim- mons cautions that the stability sought in sustainable development is not the same as models of ecological balance or stability, since balance implies some condition of long-term stability rarely present even in natural systems. Such discussions are the strong point of this book and are especially relevant to design-even though design is not mentioned in the book-because much of the latest research on eco-design, such as Life Cycle Assessment, is based on models derived from ecological science. The ecological or geographical perspective of this book is what makes it valuable as a general guide to environ- mental thinking and Simmons in fact discusses whether geography is a possible contender for the discipline of environmental construction because it brings together the physical and cultural worlds. But he concludes that its plurality of approaches and recent history-in particular the split between human and physical geographers-have prevented any such development. How- ever, it remains true that some of the more interesting recent books on green ideas and politics have come from geographers and, given the recent convergence of cultural geography and design history, this seems to be a potentially fruitful area for the ecol- ogical history or criticism of design and material culture. At any rate what these four books do show is that current rethinking about ecological issues is taking place at the interface between disciplines and is generalist in nature; thus design and design history, which are both holistic subjects, have a key role to play.
