Truth and the humanities ERAZIM KOH?K Department of Philosophy, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215 and Univerzita Karlova, Praha The universe is the kind of place where something can be true because there is something that is good. This will be a rather ironic paper. I shall, of course, mention no names since I treasure Richard Rorty both as a thinker who nudged American philosophy out of a bit of a rut and as a generous and sensitive human being. Still, I shall suggest, in effect, that in restoring the primacy of practical reason Richard Rorty may have given philosophy and the humanistic disciplines grounds for claiming that at least some of their assertions, such as "Cruelty is the basest evil," are not only noble but also non-trivially true. The final irony, I shall conclude, is that if we extend solidarity to all beings, contingency in moral matters becomes necessity. Let us, though, eschew such personal dialogues and state the matter with a bit more decorum. The question at hand is under what conditions, if any, we might be justified in claiming that the kind of assertions we typically make in philosophy and the humanities are not only interesting but also in some significant sense true, so that they ought to be regarded as valid independently of personal or cultural preference, transindividually and transculturally. Are we ever justified in considering propositions such as "Ethnic pride is the highest possible good" or "Cruelty is the basest possible evil" true or false independently of the willingness of any particular speakers to assent to or to dissent from them? I am going to suggest that this could be the case if two conditions were met. One of these is noetic - or, if you prefer, epistemological, relating to the nature of our knowing. The other is noematic - or ontological, pertain? ing to the reality we know and of which we are a part. Humanistic asser? tions, I shall suggest, could be considered true or false if we were to understand them not as theoretical descriptions of a static reality - but rather as practical interpretations whose task is to integrate experience in a meaningful whole within which intelligent choices become possible. The</page><page sequence="2">240 second condition is that we recognise the life-world so constituted not as random but as having an intrinsic, non-arbitrary moral orientation. Or, less obscurely, I believe we can consider humanistic propositions true or false if by true we mean conducive to the good and if we recognise that good as independent of our personal and cultural preference. Neither of those suggestions is, of itself, particularly novel. At least since Socrates, philosophy and the humanities devolving from it have considered themselves not a quest for theoretical knowledge but a quest for wisdom - and wisdom entails not only knowing what there is but most of all knowing how to comport ourselves with respect to it. Similarly moral realism - the idea that the cosmos has its moral up and down, good and evil - is hardly novel. Already Plato, in spite of his Pythagorean leanings, recognised that the Form of Forms, making all else intelligible, is not the Idea of Number but the Idea of the Good. A purposeless reality is also necessarily meaning? less. However, while individually not novel, those two components in recent centuries have not usually gone hand in hand. For the most part, we have tended to assume that pragmatism entails relativism while realism demands representationalism. Pragmatically inclined thinkers have tended to view truth claims with suspicion, as dogmatism, if not outright fascism. Realistically-oriented thinkers have in turn suspected that any trace of functionalism is a sign of moral decay, paving the way to scepticism. I would like to explore the opposite possibility: that it is representational realism - the stout-hearted assertion that reality is what it is and truth is its faithful mirroring - that necessarily leads to relativism and scepticism, and that it is the recognition of the functional nature of philosophical knowledge that enables us to recognise its claims as non-arbitrary. Or in the time honored if somewhat awkward Husserlian idiom, I want to suggest that the meaningful order of lived reality - its "subjectivity" - is not a theoretical but a practical one, the fungierende Subjektivit?t of Krisis IIIB - and that only as practical can it be an asbolut fungierende Subjektivit?t (Husserl, 1956: 265, ? 72). We are justified in speaking of a transcendental subjec? tivity only if we conceive of it as a transcendental practical rather than as a transcendental theoretical subjectivity in the sense of Kant's distinction between pure theoretical and pure practical reason. There can be truth in the human disciplines, I would suggest, only if we recognise the primacy of practical over theoretical reason. Lest we begin with a misunderstanding, let me begin with a disclaimer. Though I would defend the possibility of truth, I do not wish to defend any putative absolute claim of any given proposition in either a natural or an artificial language - or even the theoretical asymptotic possibility of such absolute propositions. Husserl's (1952: 154-155, ? 66) claim in Ideen I -</page><page sequence="3">241 that, as a strenge Wissenschaft, philosophy should and can generate propositions of the same universal validity as those of the physical sciences - appears to me clearly indefensible in the humanities and problematic even in the natural sciences. Here I think it wise to temper Husserl's optimism with a stiff dose of Karl Jaspers or Paul Ricoeur. Language seems to me by its very nature symbolic [Jaspers] or metaphoric [Ricoeur] rather then representational. Its claim to truth depends on its ability to evoke understanding - and that ability depends on the context of discourse. The same set of words which in one context can communicate a profound truth - say, the confession of faith or the theory of human "rights" - can convey a destructive falsehood in another. Truth, as Jaspers (1949: 45-46) would put it, is in communication, not in a proposition. The truth of a proposition depends on the understand? ing it evokes in a given set of hearers in a given context. Thus when I claim that a proposition pertaining to human phenomena can be not only interest? ing but true, I do not mean that a particular set of words ought to command assent regardless of what it communicates. My claim is far more modest: that there is something non-arbitrary to be communicated and that some propositions communicate it more or less adequately while others do not. To a traditional representational realist, that might well appear as a rather weak claim. Why would anyone doubt it? Philosophers of a realistic persuasion have insisted on far more: that they seek and approach the truth itself, understood as an accurate depiction of reality itself, as it really is. So Sigmund Freud, definitely in Traumdeutung, perhaps to the end of his life, seems convinced that the suggestive metaphors of his thought really are factual depictions of an actually existing "psychic apparatus" and that those of his followers who, like C.G. Jung, adopt different metaphors are simply factually incorrect - not telling it like it is. Similarly August Comte ex? pected sociology to tell it like it is - to be a positive science which remains strictly within the bounds of factual observation and unambiguous report? ing. Edmund Husserl in his project of descriptive phenomenology in Ideen I accepted Comte's ideal of accurate observation and faithful representation as the norm of rigorous science ("getreuer Ausdruck klarer Gegebenheiten" (1952: 154), deviating from Comte only in his willingness to include meanings rather than sense data only as positively given. For all the differences among them, humanistic thinkers as different as Comte and Rickert, Husserl and Freud - or Watson - shared the assumption that there is an univocal reality to be described and that truth is or should be a faithful representation of that reality. Their followers today tend to suspect that the relativism and scepticism of ancient sophists, Renaissance humanists and contemporary "post-modernists" alike stems from a lack of stamina, if not outright moral decay, and from a failure to hold fast to the one truth.</page><page sequence="4">242 There certainly is something morally abhorrent about the kind of moral relativism which would claim that the difference between the Nazis and their victims is merely a matter of taste - some people like picnics, other people like pogroms and there is no morally significant difference between them. Surely there must be a difference between good and evil, between right and wrong. Actually, I myself do believe that. What I do not believe is that that difference is a function of accurate and distorted representation of reality. The problem seems to me to lie not in the nature of the humanities or of their subject matter, as humanistically inclined thinkers since the Baden school have tended to believe, but in the nature of observation and represen? tation, regardless of discipline. Here N.R. Hanson's (1958: 20-25) claim, in his Patterns of Discovery, that facts themselves are theory laden seems to me much to the point. Observation, in other words, is always observation from a particular subject's standpoint. That standpoint may be as sophisti? cated as a Kuhnian paradigm theory or as prereflective as Gadamerian pre? judgements, but in any case none of us ever sees quite the same "facts" as another. Absolute knowledge - and absolute truth - would require an absolute standpoint and that is a contradiction in terms. In older European thought, it was God's-eye view that stood in for such a standpointless standpoint. Though we humans, pro statu isto, may perceive reality from a particular standpoint, our perception could be understood as approaching, albeit asymptotically, that absolute goal, a standpoint-free vision of reality. That is what omniscience was assumed to mean: not just the sum of all possible viewpoints, but a view of reality free of any view? point. God was said to know reality not as it appears but as it is in itself. The scholar, at first the theologian, then the scientist, was assumed to approximate such knowledge. What we would later come to call "objectivity" was in truth nothing less than an approximation of omnis? cience. When the faith in God effectively died on the battlefields of the Wars of Religion, that effort became problematic. The process, to be sure, was gradual. Enlightenment thinkers assumed that absolute Reason could substitute for absolute God. With the fading of the faith in Reason on the battlefields of the Naponeonic wars and with the subsequent rise of roman? ticism, Science, now with a capital "S" and increasingly restricted to theoretical representation of physical reality, sought to assume that position. The scientist, acting in his proper role, seeks to suspend or transcend his merely human standpoint. That is the faith we encounter not only in what Husserl (1952: 151, ? 64) called the sciences of the dogmatic standpoint but even in highly sophisticated writers such as Michael Pol?nyi or, for that matter, in Husserl's own conception of the self-bracketing of the</page><page sequence="5">243 phenomenologist. That strategy would encounter difficulties even in the physical sciences purporting to describe - or really model or reconstruct - reality as it would appear apart from all human observers. With quantum theory and relativity, with Heisenberg and Einstein, the conception of absolute knowledge became deeply problematic. The observer is ever a part of the observed. In the humanities, that had been obvious all along. In dealing with the colli? sion of humans rather than of electrons, say, in the case of a divorce or of a civil war, it is difficult to conceive of an "objective" reality as distinct from the reality perceived by the wife and the husband, by the Serb and the Croat. Here the perspective of the participant is an intrinsic part of the reality itself, not something external to it. The distinction between the way it really is and the way it appears breaks down. There is no "really is." The phenomenon is meaningful and intelligible only in the many ways it appears. For practical purposes, to be sure, the quest for "objectivity" or the self bracketing of the phenomenologist remain significant. Marital counselling or shuttle diplomacy are possible in part because humans are capable of standing back. The effectiveness of the counsellor or of the diplomat depends largely on their ability to offer to the contenting parties a higher order perspective, capable of subsuming their perspectives and of making them mutually understandable. At the cost of doing violence to language, we could speak of a "relatively more absolute" perspective - and in the practical work of humanistic scholars that may well be all we need to strive for. Still, that does not resolve the philosophical problem in principle, only removes it one step back on the way to an infinite regress. For in principle perception is always perception from a perspective - and human phenomena are intelligible only from a perspective. Were we to achieve complete freedom from perspective, the phenomena observed would become meaningless. We can note that in the case of the Enlightenment conception of our common humanity or of its latter-day variant, Husserl's conception of transcendental [theoretical] subjectivity. If we read Husserl as committed to representational realism and his transcendental subjectivity as a theoretical, observing subjectivity - a reading which, incidentally, I consider most unfortunate - then transcendental subjectivity would appear as an attempt at achieving an absolute viewpointless viewpoint and so either empty or false. The parallel with God's-eye point of view is, to be sure, not entirely accurate. Transcendental subjectivity is not the code name for a transcen? dent super-subject. Here the parallel with the idea of objectivity can be helpful. Objectivity is not a code name for an object: rather, it describes a</page><page sequence="6">244 particular mode of interpreting reality in terms of extentional - spatio temporal, mathematico-causal - relations. Similarly subjectivity is not a subject but rather a mode of interpreting reality in terms of relations of meaning and value, with reference to a subject. Transcendental subjectivity then refers to an ordering of reality as meaningful for any and all possible subjects, independently of any particular subject. If we interpret transcendental subjectivity as a transcendental theoretical subjectivity, we inevitably run into the problem of the absolute subject - the contradiction of the viewpointless viewpoint. Our claims can claim transcen? dental validity only as long as they remain purely formal and so also empty. The moment we claim any non-formal content, our claims become relative to a particular observer. Thus the proposition that of any two non-equidis? tant objects in space one will necesarily be nearer to an observer than the other is valid necessarily for any possible subject, but it is also rather uninformative. It becomes informative when we claim that X is nearer to Z than Y, but then it also loses its transcendental validity. In a less rigorous form, this problem confronted already those Enlighten? ment thinkers who sought to formulate a conception of our "common humanity." Intuitively, the claim that for all our differences we are ul? timately all human, fundamental to all the ideals from libert?, ?galit?, fraternit? to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is immensely appealing, but it quickly becomes problematic in application. What can be said to be common to all humans within the parameters of a theoretical, observing reason turns out to be so minimal and general as to be quite uninformative. The moment we seek to introduce observable common traits, our claims become culturally specific and so relative to a particular viewpoint. Contrary to Kant's fond hope, it seems that in the realm of pure theoretical - observing - reason propositions are always either synthetic or a priori, not both, because, with all due respect to God, an absolute standpoint is a contradictio in adiecto. The relativism and scepticism of much contemporary thought are not the result of moral lassitude or of a loss of faith in family values. They are an inevitable outcome of the equation of knowledge with faithful re-presentation of an objective reality. Yet reality as we in truth encounter it in lived experience - in contrast to reality as we reconstitute it in theory - is not "objective" but meaningfully ordered - and knowledge is not about pure representation. Humans do not need to know simply because some putative eternal essence or genetic coding endow them with a theoretical curiosity. There is little "theoretical" about their desire to know. The theoros whom Husserl invokes when he speaks of the drive to theoria - not "theory" - is not a "theoretician" but a participant in a religious drama, seeking order in his/her life, seeking to orient him/herself to self, to others and to the cosmos at large. The theoros</page><page sequence="7">245 does not ask, dispassionately, "what is true?" He/she is asking, how shall I livel More prosaically, we can say that humans need to know because their instinctual apparatus is so woefully inadequate. We do not act with the easy "instinctual" self-assurance we attribute to other animals. To act, we need to form a reasonably coherent, reasonably reliable image of what our world and our presence therein are all about. In a totally unpredictable context and/or in moments of personal disorientation humans become paralysed or strike out at random, incapable of purposive action. The collapse of a self image, such as we encounter in the collapse of a marriage or of an empire, notoriously has that effect. When a Borden Parker Bowne - or a St. Augus? tine long before him - say that the most basic human need is the need for truth, they are not speaking of some mystical endowment but of the simple fact that humans must know in order to act - and that they seek to know in order to act. That recognition becomes problematic when we reduce it, as classical pragmatism was want to do, to the assertion that ideas are instruments, even though they are also that. So phrasing it, though, seems to suggest that humans already possess an unambiguous matrix, a prereflective sense of what the world and their own presence therein are all about, so that all they need is specific conceptual tools for resolving predefined problems within a predefined context. Here a Rortyan reinterpretation of pragmatism com? mends itself: what humans seek in knowledge is not merely discrete tools but rather global symbolic systems in Cassirer's sense or the moral Weltorientierung of which Jaspers speaks, interpreting reality and defining a human task within it. That, ultimately, is the ground for the primacy of practical reason. From the perspective of theoretical reason, reality cannot mean, it can only be. A suspending of the practical dimension, suspending the idea of the Good together with the question, "what is the Good?", inevitably produces the impression of reality as absurd, as in Sartre's early fiction. Reality becomes meaningful only from the perspective of action. Yet Goethe's "Im Anfang war die Tat" is not enough. Action, too, is meaningless, a set of random movements, without an Idea of the Good to give it a sense of purpose. In that sense, philosophy is always primordially a practical endeavor, not only in the superficial sense of forging the conceptual tools to accomplish pre given goals but in the sense of raising the question of the Idea of the Good. So are all the human disciplines. Psychology does not start from a dispas? sionate desire to know but from the desire to heal and so is ab initio a morally committed, not a neutral, discipline. Mutatis mutandis, the same applies to all humanities. A human science "pure" in the sense in which we speak of pure mathematics might very well be legitimate, but it would cease</page><page sequence="8">246 to be a human science and would become a natural science of a human subject. In that sense we can say that philosophy and ultimately all humanities are basically moral disciplines. Again, moral philosophy is not ethics, an inquiry into the rules of interaction among humans and between humans and their world. Moral philosophy is the inquiry into the idea of the Good or, in traditional terms, into the summum bonum. Its task is not representa? tion but interpretation, described in phenomenological circles as Sinngebung, meaning bestowal. In another idiom it is the task of telling the stories that would suggest ways in which things [in the broadest sense] might make sense [again in the broadest sense]. It is to present humans with a coherent conception of the purpose and the context of their action. If we are very careful not to use it as an excuse for sloppy scholarship, we might just say that the task of philosophy and of the humanities is not to construct and test theories but to tell stories. Admittedly, that is a dangerous way of putting it and makes it imperative to emphasise right away that the task of philosophical story-telling - Kant's account of pure practical reason or Husserl's account of transcendental subjectivity - is not a frivolous or an arbitrary one. Not all story tellers are equally competent, nor all stories equally good and equally well told. There are also incompetent story tellers and stories badly told, leading to dis? astrous results. Suspending representational realism does not and must not mean suspending critical reason. It does not even mean dismissing all factual accuracy as pedantry. Quite the contrary, while in the realm of theoretical reason we might claim that reality is inifinitely plastic, capable of being subsumed under any consistent metatheory, in the realm of practical reason we quickly run up against what Nicolai Harmann called die H?rte des Realen, the hardness of the real. No story can be good, no interpretation adequate, if it fails to respect that hardness. Nor does that hardness have to do only with the physical conditions of human survival, from resource management to environmental protection. It has to do also with such basic incoercibles as the destructive effect of deception on the deceiver or of oppression on social cohesion. For a story to deserve being taken seriously, whether in philosophy, in sociology, in psychology or other human disciplines, it needs to be rigorously researched and thoroughly supported. It is not enough for a story teller to know what s/he wants to say. S/he must also know what s/he is talking about. A good story must be not only well informed but also well told. A will to clarity - or, to paraphrase James, a stubborn commitment to think clearly - is no less essential. That is not a matter of linguistic pedantry, such as the pedantry born of the hope that linguistic precision would make absolute representation possible. If, as we noted earlier, the purpose of speaking is</page><page sequence="9">247 not representation but communication, the criteria of clarity will need to be different. Unambiguous definitions can become counterproductive if they destroy the evocative power of a natural language. The need here is one for free communication, not just representation, and that can often be best achieved by a poetic metaphor. Still, that is not and cannot be an excuse for willful obscurantism or simple linguistic slovenliness. Precisely humanistic scholarship, giving up the discipline of representation, needs to take on the discipline of com? munication. A story which does not communicate, a story which leaves the reader bewildered or perhaps inspired but uninformed is not a good story. If a story in a human discipline is to merit serious hearing, it must be informed not only by the best possible scholarship but also by a rigorous will to communicate clearly, lest it degenerate into demagoguery. And as not all stories are equally good, neither are all story tellers. If a philosopher or any humanistic scholar wants to be taken seriously, s/he must approach the task of interpretation - the philosophic story telling - not only with a good will and good ideas, but also with a thorough and rich grounding in the breadth and depth of philosophy and culture. Without that, the stories will be naive and uncritical, retelling less well what others have told better. Precisely the thinker who sees her/his task as one of interpreta? tion, of meaning bestowal rather than simple description, needs all the erudition that three millenia of culture can provide. Philosophy as narrative is vulnerable to the arrogance of ignorance, the pr?tentions of story tellers who do not know even enough to realise how little they know and who gain credibility only by seeking out those who know even less. Good story telling requires the community of critical thought through the ages as its context. It requires, in addition, a thorough grounding in lived experience such as Husserl tried to suggest, with indifferent success, with the idea of phenomenological bracketing or Heidegger with the destruction of the history of ontology. A good story cannot be a mental chess, remaining within the confines of a conceptual system. Its problems arise out of lived experience and its concepts must remain experientially operationalisable. The relevance of Plato is not just historical, how this or that assertion fits in with other assertions of its time. It is also experiential, an attempt to conceptualise something that is no less a part of our experience than Plato's. What in lived experience led the thinker to use a particular concept, and what difference does that conceptualization entail in experience? Without such an experiential grounding, a story becomes worse than false. It becomes irrelevant. We might well come up with additional criteria of humanistic rigor. The point, though, is that criteria are needed and possible. Approaching</page><page sequence="10">248 philosophical and humanistic discourse not as a matter of representation but of interpretation does not mean that all possible narratives deserve equal hearing. There is a difference between random musings and serious thought. Minimally, humanistic discourse must respect the hardness of the real and strive for communicative clarity, it must be informed by historical erudition and enlivened by a lively sense of operational relevance. Any text failing to meet those minimal criteria is simply uninteresting, as trivial and irrelevant as the pompous pontifications of a back-yard guru. Yet though such criteria are crucial if the human disciplines are to be both creative and rigorous, they do not address our basic question: can a philosophical proposition, bestowing meaning upon the manifold of experience, claim to be true or false? Can the proposition "Cruelty is the basest evil" be said to retain its validity even if all humans were to take sadistic pleasure in just such behavior, as only too often they seem to do? Here we need to turn to the noematic or ontological portion of our inquiry. To sustain such a claim, we would have to assert that the universe is not intruth infinitely plastic and potentially consistent with any possible metatheory. Anti-realist thinkers like Quine and Rorty confirm my convic? tion that this cannot be done in the dimension of pure theoretical reason. Since there are no absolute subjects, there can be no absolute perspective. Can the claim be sustained, though, in the dimension of pure practical reason? Can we say that though the perspective of true and false is con? stituted by an observer and so remains as relative as the observer's view? point, the perspective of good and evil is intrinsic to all lived reality and so is something humans discover rather than invent, discover in the nature of of things and not in social convention merely? Or, in yet another idiom, are synthetic a priori propositions, so problematic in the realm of theoretical reason, any less problematic in the realm of practical reason? In his criticism of Kant in Krisis, Husserl (1956: 105-106, ? 28) claims that Kant cannot resolve that question because he lacks an adequate conception of reality not just as a theoretical construct but as life's world, the Lebenswelt, ordered by the presence of life. Kant's conception of reality remains Cartesian, contrasting a merely extensional phenomenal reality with a meaningful noumenal one, so that all that pertains to freedom, including meaning and value, must be inserted in the former realm by the subject. The world of lived experience, life's world, is never Cartesian, purely extensional. Life is not an afterthought. It is present ab initio. Perhaps that is the recognition which Leibniz sought to express by claiming that the basic component of reality is not an atom of matter but a monad of purpose whose substance is entelecheia. As life's world, the world is thus purposively ordered as lived, as it is not as observed. We need therefore turn to a phenomenology of the life world and ask how it is that the world</page><page sequence="11">249 presents itself to us not as neutral but as ordered in terms of good and evil. The question here does not concern the specific value of particular entities or acts. Rather, it is a question about the nature of reality as a whole. Paraphrasing Leibniz, we might say that the question is why is there something good, not simply something? To a pure disinterested observer, reality would surely present itself not as value laden but simply as being, neither good nor ill till thinking makes it so. We can approximate that mode of experiencing in a Gedankenexperiment in which we try to imagine reality from God's-eye point of view. We in fact approximate that when observing events long ago or far away where our purposes do not reach, or in mo? ments of shock that suspend our purposiveness. In all such cases, reality, purely as observed and not as something in which we participate, does appear meaningless, simply there. How is it that it appears meaningful when we live it rather than simply observing it? The most obvious way the world appears as value-laden and meaning? fully ordered as we live it is that it presents itself to us as the world in which we act - and that it presents itself first to our action, not our reflection. Long before reflection, long before thought, the world is already something we encounter as aiding or hindering our acts. That act may be as elementary as breathing. Simply the fact that we are beings who inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide constitutes light airy places as desirable, dark dank dungeons as places to be avoided. As William James (1890: 9) pointed out, even unicellular organisms manifesting avoidance and approach behavior testify that they live in a value-ordered world. They and their more complex kin like plants and non-human animals may not think in those terms, some of them may not think at all, yet their discriminating behavior testifies that their world is not indifferent but has a definite value orientation. The moment there is life, the world acquires an orientation, even though it might take humans to describe it in terms of good and evil. It is this very basic experience of our being acting beings, aided and hindered by the world, that makes utilitarianism so persuasive in spite of all its theoretical flaws. We experience in terms of utility long before we think or reflect: some things hinder, others help. Similarly, a different experience makes formalism persuasive, again in spite of all its theoretical failings. We are not only beings who act but also beings who anticipate. We approach our world with expectations - and the world we encounter either meets or fails to meet them, presenting itself to us as more or less perfect. On the level of theory, we might well wish to claim that fulfilled expectations represent a form of utility or perhaps vice versa. On the level of lived experience, such speculation is beside the point. Here the reality is that we encounter the world of our lives as better and worse in terms of our expecta? tions as well as as good or evil in terms of our purposes.</page><page sequence="12">250 Again, this dimension of value also precedes reflection. More complex organisms - notoriously dogs and other non-human animals we know from close contact - exhibit disappointment over expectations not met. If habit is a form of expectation, we might extend this dimension of value experience quite far down the scale of complexity. The important point is that, as in the case of utility, the value orientation of reality is not a function of reflection but rather of the very nature of life's presence as an activity, as purposing, as anticipating - or, altogether, of its transcendental practical subjectivity. Still, were this all, our problem might well reemerge, since both the value of utility and of relative perfection could be said to be relative to particular agents. As I have argued elsewhere, the problem is that a relation between two intrinsically value-less relata does not constitute value. One hundred Confederate dollars do not become valuable because they equal one Confederate war bond. Nor does something become valuable by living up to an intrinsically worthless norm, as a sequence of Five Year Plans convinced us. Value is a relational reality which does not arise unless one of the relata is already valuable independently of that relation. The ex? perienced reality of extrinsic value, amply attested, points thus to a more basic experience of value as intrinsic. This, I believe, is the deep-rooted experience which traditional philosophy sought to express in such claims as that esse qua esse bonum est or that esse est unum, bonum, verum - that being is good simply in virtue of being or that univocity, truth and goodness are its convertible qualities. Since most of us are steeped in that tradition, we tend to accept the good? ness of being as a moral a priori, as primitive and irreducible as G.E. Moore's (1991) conception of the Good. When, however, I said as much in another paper (1991), my claim drew a critical response from John Lachs. To be sure, John Lachs took me to mean that being is intrinsically benevolent, useful or perhaps even friendly and proceded to invoke ex? amples of all the malevolent, obstreperous and downright obnoxious beings there are. I have known a few of those myself. My claim, however, is more basic - that being, whatever its particular qualities, is intrinsically valuable and worthy of respect. More basically still, I wish to express a very deep rooted experience - that, universally, it is good to be and bad to perish. Why the intuitively evident universality of that experience? We might, with Max Scheler, point to empathy: in the perishing of the other, we might say, we encounter an image of our own finitude. There but for the grace of God go I. Demonstrably, persons capable of greater empathy tend to be more sensitive to the good and ill of others; those unable to empathise - for instance, unable to draw a cup as it would appear to a person seated opposite them - are likely to be far less considerate of the suffering of others.</page><page sequence="13">251 There is, though, a more basic recognition still, one which Hans Jonas analyses in his Imperative of Responsibility - that being is good because its being is a good for it and because in the pursuit of it it is capable of generat? ing value. Life is a value for itself: whatever is alive wishes to remain alive. The gipsy moth seeking to avoid the menacing hand, the spider protecting her eggs, even the plant struggling to recover from an injury all testify to it. Granted, the metaphor of "wanting to stay alive" is anthropomorphic in the extreme, but the metaphor of "instinct" or of chemical reactions are no less metaphoric and rather less experientially accurate. All such metaphors are ways of pointing to a basic reality which we seek to capture by assertions such as that being seeks to persist in being, that whatever is alive wants to remain alive and will struggle to do so, or that for all being life is a victory and death a defeat. Certainly, there are situations when a particular living being, for reasons specific to it, chooses to give up, accepting voluntary death, as an old, ailing moose walking toward the wolf pack. Certainly, death has its place in the cycle of life. Though we have discarded Aristotle's distinction between natural and violent movement, we cling to it in that one instance, speaking of natural death in contrast to a violent one. There are times when life is spent, there are times when death becomes a release. Still, those are specific situations. The basic reality is the opposite - that whatever lives wants to go on living, that whatever lives would rather live than die. Most primordially, life is a value for itself. Or, more generally, being is good in itself because it is good for itself There is a second dimension as well: being is good because it can generate value. This is something we noted earlier. A living being seeking to remain alive - since its life is a value for it - constitutes its context valuable as a means of its own perpetuation. The woodchuck is good and ought to be respected because its life is a value for it. The unmowed meadow is not a merely extentional reality because the woodchuck grazes on it. In another of those Gedankenexperimente so dear to philosophers a century ago, we can note that a wholly inanimate universe becomes valuable when we introduce at least one living being into it, good because its life is a value to it and because in perpetuating it it constitutes the hitertho value-neutral universe as valuable. Pushing the experiment further, a universe containing at least one being is more valuable than an empty void because that being is a value for itself. Granted, such Gedankenexperimente have little value as proofs. Rather like the arguments for the existence of God, they are useful not in convinc? ing but in evoking understanding. Still, they are suggestive. Being is good in itself because it is good for itself and because it is capable of generating</page><page sequence="14">252 value. While from the standpoint of pure theoretical reason reality may appear as wholly undifferentiated and value neutral, in the participatory realm of practical reason it contains ab initio a basic asymmetry: to be is good, to perish is bad. That which sustains being is good, that which destroys it is bad. Here, unlike in the realm of pure theoretical reason, we can speak of a transcendental practical meaning-ordering or "subjectivity." Certainly, that basic orientation requires elaboration. We need to note that it is life in its natural rhythm that is good, not simply proliferation. Unrestrained growth is cancer, not life. Though I am convinced that what Dewey had in mind by "growth" was the unfolding of life's natural program - a mix of Hegel and biology - in an age which has made expan? sion its program it is useful to note that value is sustainable life, a life which does not destroy itself like lemmings multiplying until they drive them? selves into their fatal attempt at cross-oceanic migration. Another point is no less important to note: since all life is good and since this is a finite planet, harmony is good as making optimal coexistence of life possible. The reason is not that harmony is "nature's law," as Renais? sance thinkers fondly believed. Today that claim would be hard to sustain. In terms of simple observation, conflict surely describes nature as much as harmony. The value of harmony is moral, not factual, derived from practi? cal, not from theoretical reason: that all life is valuable in itself because it is a value for itself, capable of generating value, and so worthy of respect. Though there be no descriptive a priori, there is a practical one: life is good in itself because it is good for itself and whatever sustains and enhances life in the harmony of its multiplicity is good, whatever destroys it is evil. With that reference point in mind we can return to our earlier point: the task of philosophy and of the humanities is to tell the stories which trans? form the manifold of experience into a meaningful whole and which should be judged in terms of how well they accomplish that task. Some, failing to meet minimal criteria, can be dismissed as trivial; others, well wrought, can be considered as interesting. Among the latter, some sustain and enhance life in the harmony of its multiplicity, others destroy it - and in that sense the one can be called true - binding regardless of personal and cultural preference - and the others false, not acceptable as a guide to belief or practice. The proposition, "Ethnic pride is the highest possible good" is viciously false, because it leads to the wantom destruction of being in its multiplicity. The proposition, "Cruelty is the bases possible evil" is not only interesting but also true since what it condems is precisely such wantom destruction. While the rule of pure theoretical reason is relativity, the rule of pure practical reason is the transcendental subjectivity of good and evil. Let me close with an ironic coda. The last proposition was not an act but an observation: what of it? Is the proposition that "Life is good in itself</page><page sequence="15">253 because it is good for itself or the proposition that "Whatever sustains and enhances life in its harmony is good" itself true? Is the cosmos really like that? That is the most basic consensus of our culture, and I do believe that both propositions are true. However, they are not descriptions but interpreta? tions, Sinngebungen, and so true in the specific sense we have just elaborated - they serve to sustain and enhance life, the life which is good in itself because it is good for itself, life in the harmony of its multiplicity, better than any others. Does then the argument become circular? To be sure, it does, and necessarily so. In affirming the primacy of practical reason we have given up the hope of a representational realistic grounding. Moral realism can sustain itself only on moral grounds - and so in what is ultimately a circular argument. However, as Hegel already knew, providing that the circle is big enough to enclose all of reality, a circular argument becomes the strongest argument of all, a closed system of the whole. That may well be the ultimate irony: if we extend Richard Rorty's solidarity from humans to all being, its contingency becomes a necessity. References Hanson, N.R. (1958). Patterns of discovery.
