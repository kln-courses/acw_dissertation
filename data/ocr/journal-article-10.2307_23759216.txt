Monumental columns which serve as doorway features are usually plain, but many exhibit also geometrical, textual or figurative designs in low or high relief. The probably earliest reference to Yucatec relief columns has been published by John L. Stephens, who encountered at Rancho Nohcacab, Yucatán, during his journey to the penin sula of Yucatan in the years of 1841 to 1842 "two sculptured monuments of curious design and excellent workmanship" (Stephens 1963:58).In 1982, during a visit 1 paid to the rancho and adjacent Maya ruins both sculptures could be found, documented and recognized typologically as doorway col umns in high relief (Mayer 1982). Several decorated columns were described and illustrated by Teobert Maler (1997). Tatiana Proskouriakoff (1950) published the first comprehensive docu mentation of columns and presented illustrations of 19 exam ples, and Harry Pollock (1980) documented additional columns from the Puuc Zone. The first attempt of cataloging carved doorway columns (Mayer 1981) listed 89 specimens of known and unknown provenance. Further monographic studies of this monument corpus were published by Lawrence Mills (1985), Maria del Mar de Pablo Aguilera (1992), and Julie Patrois (2008:135-139,301-302) included investigations of relief columns in a general study of Maya sculpture from the peninsula of Yucatan. At present it can be estimated that the known corpus of carved doorway columns encompasses around 120 examples, and additional monuments surface from time to time. In 2010, Donald M. Hales kindly provided a photo of a previously unpublished column fragment in a private collec tion (Cover) and inNovember 2011 he supplied dimensions of it. The limestone object constitutes the upper section of a bas relief doorway column; thepresentheightis32"(ca. 81 cm)and the width is 19" (ca. 48 cm). Obviously the column has been sawn in half vertically to re duce its weight. The sculp tured image represents the upper section of an elaborately decorated male figure in side view, facing left. The standing figure holds in his right hand a staff or lance, and in the left hand a tasseled round shield. The personage wears a high composite headdress, with a headband mask, feathers and a water lily element. A particular sriking iconographic feature is a small anthropomorphic seated figure attached to the back of the protagonist, shown in a seated position and in side view, facing to the right. The surviving scene is enframed by plain bands at the top and both sides. The vertical top border is divided by a horizon tal groove. No place of origin of this relief fragment could be found out, however it is definitely a counter part of another un provenanced bas-relief column Fig. 1. The "Santa Ana" which was lent around 1980 doorway column _ . (Photo courtesy of from an anonymous private Keith A. Dixon, collection to the Bowers Mu- 1980) seum in Santa Ana, California, and has been preliminarily designated as "Column 1, Santa Ana 1" (Fig. 1; Mayer 1981:29, pi. 16,right). ArmandLabbé(1982:76.Cat.No. 149) described the column in the Bowers Museum, but did not provide an illustration. He suggested that the monument comes from the Yucatan Peninsula, is in the Puuc style and dates to the Late Classic, ca. A.D. 750-900. He noted a "manikin figure" at tached to the back of the loincloth belt of the figure. I have published a brief description of the Santa Ana column (Mayer 1984:30-31, pi. 40), and suggested on stylistic and icono graphic grounds that it might originate from the Puuc site of Xcocha in Campeche, where three comparable doorway col umns were recorded (Proskouriakoff 1950; Pollock 1980). The monument was on exhibit at the EPCOT Center in Florida, and briefly described (Walt Disney World 1984, Cat. No. 75), its present location is unknown. Patrois (2008:126, fig. 41) pub lished a drawing of it. Both unprovenanced bas-relief doorway columns, the Santa Ana and the one presented here, have so many parallel iconographic similarities, that I am convinced that they are not only from the same archaeological site somewhere in the Puuc Zone of Campeche, but that they formed a columnar doorway of a single structure. The most striking features that evidence that they are companion pieces and probably formed a pair are the small anthropomorphic figures, perhaps a deity, bound to the belts of the protagonists, a unique iconographic complex not known from other carved doorway columns or other Puuc monument types. Stilistically, the two columns can presently be assigned to the Terminal Classic period. Ilivi Fig. 1. The "Santa Ana" doorway column. (Photo courtesy of Keith A.
