<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bios 43 The Philosophic Jellyfish by JOEL W. HEDGPETH (The following document, evidently the report of an unrecorded meeting of the Royal Society sometime during the dark days of the blitz, has come to my hands in a manner which, for obvious reasons, I cannot divulge. The author.) That the idea of progress is not an anthropormorphism can im- mediately be seen if we consider what views would be taken by a philosophic tapeworm or jellyfish. Granted that such organisms could reason, they would have to admit that they were neither domi- nant types, nor endowed with any potentiality of further advance, but that one was a degenerate blind alley, the other a specialization of a primitive type long left behind by more successful forms of life.- Julian Huxley. Evolution: The Modern Synthesis. pp. 565-566. (Har- per's, 1943) Let us suppose that I am that philosophic jellyfish whose wisdom might be capable of conceding the impersonal phenomenon of progress. It may be hard to do, for a jellyfish has no discernible brain and may not be particularly interested in such imponderable matters. As a jellyfish I would undoubtedly be content to swim gently with the tide on a summer night. However, here I am, a jellyfish, quietly dilating my umbrella in a tank of sea water on a table in the meeting room of the Philosophical Society. Since I have been selected for my philosophical qualities, it would not become me to be vain of my person, but I doubt that I would be able to restrain a certain pardonable pride in being what I am. If the philoso- phers would turn off the lights in their room they would see that I am luminescent, that I glow in the dark with a pale bluish-white light, and that my sexual organs are a delightful shade of pale pink. The artists would have to concede that my shape is the nearest thing in the realm of creation to that perfect curve, the circle. The philosophers have returned to their seats after looking at me for a few moments, and the chairman has cleared his throat. Dr. Julian Huxley,* he informs the philosophers, will preside at this meeting, which promises to be one of the most interesting held in this hall. Dr. Huxley, who does not bear very much resemblance to his dis- tinguished grandfather, who was an authority on us jellyfishes-indeed he discovered what marvelous creatures we really were-stood up beside my tank and ordered the light to be turned off. *This paper has been read by Doctor Huxley and its publication ap- proved. Author.</page><page sequence="2">44 Bios "Some time ago," he began, without looking at me in my tank, "I published certain remarks about the views of a philosophic jellyfish. I was unaware, at the time, that I had been indulging in more than a fanciful metaphore, but it seems that someone, evidently personally acquainted with the jellyfishes, conveyed my remarks to this gentleman-and persuaded him to come here tonight." I signalled "Thank you" by turning myself on and off in Morse Code, but the young man who had been assigned to translate my remarks was not watching and Dr. Huxley had to remind him of his job, and no one seemed to realize that I was trying to acknowledge the compliment of being called a gentleman. "We have arranged," resumed Dr. Huxley, "to carry on a discussion with this jellyfish. He will understand anything spoken over his tank as he can pick up the vibrations of the voice against the water, and will reply, as you have already seen" he smiled wryly-"in Morse code by turning his phosphorescence on and off." I acknowledged with a flicker as the philosophers gathered around the tank again and peered down at me. Had they been aware that my little red eyes on the rim of my body could discern their physiognomies, they might not have been so eager. They were a motley lot of wizened, bearded, and corpulent faces, and the eyes of most of them were reinforced by spectacles of various thicknesses-an aid that no jellyfish needs. "There are many interesting matters we would like to discuss with our friend in the tank, but the discussion this evening must be confined to progress. As you know, this is a favorite subject of mine, and the re- marks to which our fellow philosopher in the tank have taken exception concerned the nature of progress." "As I understand it," I blinked from the depths of my tank, "Dr. Huxley believes that progress is a directional process of evolution, that it it has been chiefly manifested in the development of man, but that it is not a notion of the men themselves. He has, without our leave, invoked the support of such philosophers as myself." "Our friend seems to understand me very well, but I should like to forestall what he appears to be in danger of falling into, namely the con- fusion of specialization with progress. The jellyfish, as we all know, is a specialized type that has achieved adaptation with its environment and has survived through several epochs. I cannot agree that adaptation with an environment is the aim of progress-progress has moved in the direc- tion of speech and conceptual thought." "There you go again, trying to put thoughts under my umbrella for me. What I came here tonight for was to find out where you got this idea that progress, granted it does exist, is for your benefit-perhaps you</page><page sequence="3">Bios 45 can insist in all sincerity that progress is not an anthropomorphic idea, but you cannot deny that it's very anthropocentric of you to insist that you are the end product of progress. I suspect that it's just because you're unhappy with your lot and have thought up this notion of progress to give yourself the faith that you are really going somewhere." "Hear, hear," said a bearded voice. "It's quite obvious to me that progress is an objective phenomenon," said Dr. Huxley, somewhat impatiently. "I do not believe that it is necessary to assume a purpose to justify man. The purpose manifest in evolution is only apparent. As I have said elsewhere, 'It is just as much a product of blind forces as is the falling of a stone to earth or the ebb and flow of the tides. It is we who have read purpose into evolution'." "How can you deny purpose and at the same time insist that progress exists?" I signalled back. "I prefer to take the opposite view, that any sort of progress is a delusion, but that there is purpose in evolution. That purpose is the survival of life as a component force in the universe. I may not be progressive, but I certainly am purposeful." "If my attitude is anthropomorphic, I would say that yours is coelen- teromorphic," rejoined Dr. Huxley. "You are back on that notion that progress-or purpose-is measured by adaptation to an end." "I seem to remember, Doctor, that you have said that the future of progressive evolution is the future of man." "To me that is quite obvious. To quote myself again, 'Man can guide his future by deliberate purpose and aid the progress of evolution.' What can you do, a jellyfish floating with the tide?" "Let's not be personal. In the first place I don't want to be anything but a jellyfish. I'm happy-or will be-when I get back in the ocean. Ac- cording to my view, man has already served his purpose. He has been a very disastrous experiment as far as the rest of life is concerned. Thou- sands of my relatives have been killed by the stuff he has dumped from his factories into the oceans, and because of the explosions he has set off under the water to kill other men. I understand that affairs are much worse on land." "I think these things will pass eventually, that man will make a better man of himself in time." "In other words, you expect to do better when you have more brains, although you already insist that you have more than any creature on the globe." "That is not quite fair, Mr. Jellyfish. We men are all too aware of our shortcomings, but as a biologist I cannot see how evolution, moving in the direction it has moved, could have produced anything but man. It is</page><page sequence="4">46 Bios now man's duty to continue in the direction that will best develop his own unique features. That is progress." "Even if it kills all us jellyfishes?" "I hardly think that will be necessary. At any rate, we shall certainly want to conserve representative forms of animal life for scientific pur- poses. "How thoughful of you. And how anthropocentric." "We are getting away from our subject. You cannot deny that the nervous system of man is much more highly organized than that of other animals-" "I have been waiting for that. I think your brain is a mistake of evolution. Certainly you can't expect it to grow any larger-your women already have difficulty getting your big-headed babies out of their bodies. Hasn't someone suggested that your brain may be a tumor on your ner- vous system and that its further enlargement may be lethal to your species?" "That's just a fanciful idea, like the suggestion that life is a disease of matter," retorted Dr. Huxley. "But the first thing you did with your brain was to presume that you had a special connection with the powers of creation. Certainly that was a curiously abnormal way to think." "What do you mean, a special connection with the powers of creation ?" asked one of the bearded philosophers. "You crawled off into the caves and built images of the animals you wanted to kill, and then you stuck spears into them." "That was superstitious magic-we've outgrown that long ago." "I don't see much difference between cave man's magic and Dr. Hux- ley's suggestion that a mechanistic process of evolution can be altered by the latest results of that process." "I'm sure I didn't say that," remarked Dr. Huxley, resuming his place as interlocutor. "What I said was that man has the power to direct his future, to realize progress through evolution." "Sounds like the same thing, to me. No jellyfish would be so pre- sumptuous." "Perhaps that's why you're still a jellyfish," said a voice from the dark. "And why shouldn't I be a jellyfish? What's wrong about floating with the tide? At least we jellyfishes are not electrocuting ourselves with a dynamo of energy gone berserk in our society." The philosophers said nothing for a moment. Finally Dr. Huxley spoke. "I think our friend is getting tired. It must be quite an effort for him to turn his whole body off and on to talk to us."</page><page sequence="5">Bios 47 I was about to signal "Nonsense" when someone else said. "It's quite remarkable how this animal has managed to do all that signalling. It seems to have solved the problem of energy." A small, skeptical voice from the back of the group made itself heard: "Unless this whole performance is a hoax." "What do you mean, sir !" shouted the chairman, re-asserting his authority. "You may see for yourself that there are no wires connected to the tank or to the specimen." "Well I, for one, should like to examine that jellyfish thoroughly. I think we should dissect it." "He's just like any other jellyfish," said Dr. Huxley. He could have been less uncomplimentary. "If he's just like any other jellyfish, I am sure there will be no harm in sacrificing him for science." This was a new voice. I was beginning to get nervous, and retreated to the bottom of the tank, and turned off my light. "Gentlemen!" said Dr. Huxley. "I made a promise to this jellyfish that he would be returned to the ocean. It would not be right to violate that promise!" "What's rights and promises to a jellyfish! I say we owe a greater duty to science, to study this specimen in detail." It was time, I thought, to try to turn this conversation-if such it could be called-to safer, more philosophical subjects. Even a jellyfish has the instinct for self preservation. "Do you consider," I ventured, "your duty to an abstraction like science so high that you would forget your own values? No wonder you believe in progress." "I don't see that values have anything to do with it," observed Dr. Huxley, coming to my rescue. "Progress is an objective phenomenon. Like some of my fellow biologists, your objections are displaying a lack of training in logic. Of course, when it comes to the case of man, values must be considered-men must determine which values they want to de- velop, but that is man's peculiar problem. But the demonstration that progress does exist, is, I believe, a fundamental contribution of evolutionary biology to human thought." 'In other words, progress really doesn't mean anything to a jellyfish, so it isn't important that I agree or disagree with you that I am one of its blind alleys. You are interested in human thought, not the thought of a jellyfish." "I'm afraid this conversation hasn't been very profitable. We seem to be unable to avoid personal recriminations." "Well, Dr. Huxley, I am afraid that you must take the blame for that. You started by taking my opinion of the exalted state of man for</page><page sequence="6">48 Bios granted. Furthermore, I understand that when you men want to accuse a fellow man of lack of character you call him a spineless jellyfish. That's hardly complimentary. I demand to be returned to the ocean, where I can drift with the tide, undisturbed by these silly problems of anthropo- centric men." "Really, I think we ought to pickle this fellow. He's just another escapist," said the skeptical voice. The chairman banged a gavel. "I think it is time to close this meet- ing,- and fulfill our obligations as gentlemen by returning our visiting philosopher to the ocean as he requests." There were some murmurings and objections, but after a few minutes several of the members left. Finally Dr. Huxley lifted my tank off the table and started to carry it out of the room. "Just a minute Dr. Huxley," called the young Morse expert who had been transcribing my remarks. "You'll have to cover that tank. You can't carry a light through the streets in a blackout. Mustn't give the jerries a target, you know!" So they wrapped a black cloth around my glass tank and Dr. Huxley carried me through the streets of the city to the railroad station, listening anxiously for the sound of enemy aircraft overhead. When I was at last carried down to the seaside, Dr. Huxley remarked that he hoped it would be possible for me to keep my light off until I was beyond the three mile limit, as I might reveal information to the enemy if I was not careful.</page></plain_text>
