<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> BOOK REVIEW  Understanding Dogs  By Clinton R. Sanders  Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1999  201 pp. $59.50 (cloth); $19.95 (paper)  Reviewed by Steven Worden, University of Arkansas  Given the first sentence of UnderstandingD ogs, “I will admit at the beginning that I  really love dogs,” one might be justified in being slightly skeptical of Clinton R.  Sanders’s observations and analyses. And, given the book’s front cover, graced with  a photograph of the author’s grandfather playing with a dog, and the back cover, on  which there is a photograph of the author posed between two dogs (with whom he  shares more than a passing resemblance), one cannot shake the nagging sense that  this work is unmistakably a labor of love. However, far from being a paean to  Man’s Best Friend, Sanders’s work closely and carefully probes the social and  emotional complexity and ambivalence of human-canine interaction in everyday  life. Understanding Dogs is a witty, moving, and insightful reflection on a topic of  widespread interest.  Some readers embarking on a study of the intimate association between dogs  and people might at some point pause and say, “These people really need some kids!”  And Sanders, warming to a theme that weaves throughout the book, argues that he  does, in fact, view dogs from a “familial” perspective. He focuses on the ways in which  dogs seem to interact as thoughtful, emotional, and intentional “virtual persons” with  humans in a variety of ongoing relationships. He grounds his perspective in ten  years of ethnographic data from everyday life with dogs, interviews with guide dog  users and trainers, and ethnographic materials collected over an extended period in  a veterinarian clinic.  In studying the bond of intimacy between dog owners and their companions in  everyday life, Sanders discovered that dogs may serve as social facilitators, signifi-  cant others, and extensions of the self. In filling the role of significant others in pub-  lic settings, as Sanders observed in a “puppy kindergarten,” the actions of misbe-  having dogs are explained with their owners’ aligning actions and quasi-theorizing  much in the same way that we account for children’s misdeeds. In everyday life,  owners seem to view their dogs as playful “persons” and emphasize the empathic  Symbolic Interaction, Volume 23, Number 3, pages 313-315, ISSN 0195-6086.

Dogs may also serve as exten-  sions of the self, as evidenced by the growing popularity of rottweilers, pit bulls, and  other aggressive dogs. But what of the extension of the physical self in the case of  the visually impaired? What are the meanings of that social world?  In the second setting for his research, Sanders painstakingly interviewed guide  dog owners and guide dog trainers in order to learn the meanings and the nature of  dog-human interactions in that unique social world. Employing the construct of the  “career,” Sanders traces out the initial stages of a guide dog user’s encounter with  the dog, learning to use the dog, and negotiating the slights and misunderstandings  with the public as the user and the dog encounter the world. The dog trainer’s ca-  reer similarly involves an initial phase: the acquisition of “dog understanding,” en-  counters with the public, and the construction of the guide dog/owner team. Inter-  estingly, in contrast to many everyday dog owners’ tendencies to overemphasize the  abilities of their dogs, guide dog trainers viewed the public image of guide dogs as  “superdogs” with distaste.  It was in the setting of the veterinary practice that Sanders seemed to encounter  the most problematic interactions between service providers, animals, and the ani-  mals’ owners. Uncontrollable, dangerous, “defiling,” and unhealthy dogs were just a  few of the animal-owner difficulties with which veterinary staff had to contend on  a daily basis. A large part of the world of the veterinarian also revolved around  the emotionally delicate “orchestration” of death. As in the case with the guide dog  animal trainers, veterinary personnel seemed to oscillate between viewing animals  as unique “virtual persons” and making professional requirements of structuring  and normalizing interactions with a more dispassionate behavioristic perspective.  In the concluding section of his work, Sanders explicitly pulls together strands la-  tent in his research and analysis for a broadside against G. H. Mead’s old conten-  tion that because nonhuman animals lack a capacity for sharing symbols, nonhu-  man animals lack a sense of self and cannot “think” in the fullest sense. Breaking  with the groundedness of his earlier analyses, Sanders draws from research on the  gorillas Koko and Washoe, baboons, chimpanzees, and even an African gray parrot  to rebut Mead’s assertion. At this point Sanders seems to opt out of the sociology of  everyday life/emotions paradigm, with its reigning constructivist tone, and align  with the cognitive ethologists, arguing for the understanding of nonhuman animals  as emotional, thoughtful, intentional, and empathic interactional social partners.  While admitting that nonhuman animals are not “small persons with fur,” Sanders  does insist that we should recognize dogs’ consciousness and purposefulness.  Understanding Dogs is a fine and admirable work, from its cleverly ambiguous ti-  tle (who is doing the understanding?) to its impassioned critique of our social scien-  tific tendency to denigrate recognition of the status of nonhuman animals as mere  anthropomorphism. Although I must claim agnosticism when it comes to believing  whether or not dogs have a “conscience,” feel shame or sadness, and so on, San-  ders does argue for an important corrective to Mead’s now-qualifiable position on  the uniqueness of humans’ capacity for awareness.

Sanders makes a nice theoretical contribution with his  critique, although he almost defeats himself with his overly harsh, “Bluntly put, it is  stupid to assume that a perspective is false simply because we are not entirely sure that  it is true” (p. 148). Sanders obviously has some commitment to his critical perspective.  Methodologically, Sanders’s work is impressive. He is a skilled observer and  shrewd interpreter of his settings. I asked a veterinarian to read the chapter on the  veterinary clinic, and she corroborated his observations: “He very realistically cap-  tured the day-to-day happenings in a vet clinic, maybe more than veterinarians  would like to have revealed.” (Veterinarians really don’t like it when owners don’t  tell them that a dog will bite!) As an adherent to a more behaviorist orientation,  this veterinarian opined that the veterinary profession deliberately fostered a “fa-  milial” interpretation of animals for practitioners’ own economic benefit.  In sum, Understanding Dogs, is an intelligent, credible, and goodhearted piece of  sociological research and analysis. With its novel and interesting application of con-  cepts such as interaction, role, identity, significant other, excusing tactics, quasi-  theorizing, negotiation, ambivalence, it would make an excellent accompanying text  for undergraduate courses in sociology, social psychology, sociology of everyday  life, or sociology of emotions.  And finally, my cocker spaniel loved our discussion of the book. The tomcat was  less impressed.  </page> </plain_text>
