<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Minoan Snake Tube: A Survey and Catalogue GERALDINE C. GESELL PLATES 41- 4 Abstract Two relatively recent excavations have uncovered tubular objects which contribute to our under- standing of the Minoan snake tube-a tubular ves- sel with serpentine handles. The snake tubes from Kannia near Gortyn provide new evidence for the use and date of this type of object, while the LM IB tubes from Pyrgos near Myrtos shed light on its ori- gin. Several tubes from Kannia and Prinias are published here for the first time as well as new in- formation about the tubes from Koumasa and Kephala Khondrou. After an individual discussion of each existing tube and a general discussion of the previously suggested origins and uses, the fol- lowing conclusions have been reached: (i) the tubes are a Post-Palatial development of the LM IB tubes from Pyrgos, Myrtos; (2) the tubes served as stands for offering bowls; (3) they were placed on the floor in front of the cult bench which supported the figures of the goddess with up-raised hands. The photographs of all the tubes are new; drawings have been included for several Kannia tubes. The Minoan snake tube is an interesting but puzzling class of objects found only in Crete. It was given its distinctive name by Sir Arthur Evan:s, who connected it with snake worship,1 and as early as 90go Wide characterized its two op- posing rows of loop handles as stylized snakes.2 Besides these serpentine handles the tube normally has a splayed base surrounded by plastic rings and a top similarly decorated; although the top is al- way:s open, the bottom is often solid. All the tubes are handmade by the coil method. The majority were found together with goddesses with up-raised hands and other cult material, and several come from a type of rectangular room with a bench which Banti has identified as a room-sanctuary.3 It is certain, therefore, that they have some cult use, but their connection with snake worship is problematic. The particular function of snake tubes in the room-sanctuary has been a matter of discussion from the time of their first discovery by Halbherr at Prinias in 1900oo. Wide published these tubes as clay images, for he believed that they were an ear- lier form of the goddess with up-raised hands with which they were found.' Xanthoudides likewise identified the tubes from Koumasa as clay idols.5 Williams, however, felt that the Gournia tubes were stands for offering bowls or cups.6 Zahn, whom Nilsson later followed, suggested libation tubes for receiving liquid libations which in turn flowed into the earth.' Marinatos, the excavator of the Gazi tubes, believed that they were flower pots.8 Evans himself, although he identified tubes with attached cups from a house near the palace at Knossos as shelters for snakes, left open the ques- tion of the exact use of the cupless tubes with ser- pentine handles." Similar objects found in the Near East are thought to have been incense burners.'" The date of many of the Minoan snake tubes is also debatable. Tubes from several sites can be se- curely dated to LM III by associated pottery, but others, lacking full publication or associated datable pottery, have had dates ranging from MM to Ori- entalizing assigned to them.

GESELL [AJA 80 with at least five snake tubes together with six goddesses and the more recently excavated LM IB cult deposit at Pyrgos, Myrtos, have contributed new information for the discussion of the date and usage of the snake tube. A survey of the extant examples, their characteristics, and find-spots may help to narrow the possibilities and simplify, if not eliminate, these problems. The following list (alphabetical by site) includes all published examples as well as the new unpub- lished tubes from Kannia." The reader should refer to the catalogue at the end of the article for a detailed description and bibliography of each ex- tant tube. GAZI Two snake tubes were found together with five goddesses with up-raised hands in a room-sanctuary at Gazi." No bench was preserved but possible traces of a wooden floor or stands were found under all the objects. The arrangement of the finds at the time of excavation suggests that the god- desses were placed around the walls of the room, each with at least one cult vessel (ill. I). In three cases the type of clay of the cult vessel matches the type of clay of the goddess with which it was found, and this feature, similarity of clay, suggests that particular vessels belonged to or were made for particular goddesses. The rectangular offering table lying in front of goddess 9307 is of the same buff clay as the goddess, and the bowl lying in front of goddess 9309 is of the same vivid red clay as its goddess, although the kylikes next to the bowl are fine ware. A cylindrical vessel (not a snake tube) is of the same vivid red clay as goddess 9308 lying nearby. Snake tube 9303, goddesses 9305 and 9306, and a three-eared bowl were chance finds before the excavation; however, their general area of dis- covery is indicated by the dotted line on the plan. Tube 9303 (cat. I; pl. 41, fig. I) presumably be- longs to goddess 9305 which is of the same buff clay. Snake tube 9304 (cat. 2; pl. 41, fig. 2), the find-spot of which is indicated on the plan, and the remaining chance find goddess 9306, although not of the same clay, were both completely covered with red paint. Since they were the only objects in the room painted in this way, it is reasonable to assume that they belong together. The chance find bowl is of vivid red clay and may belong to god- dess 9308. By clay and position one can identify several types of vessels suitable for holding offer- ings-bowls, kylikes, and an offering table-with goddesses 9307, 9308, and 9309. However the only objects matching goddesses 9305 and 9306 are snake tubes. This suggests that the snake tubes likewise served as containers for offerings. Tube 9304 cer- tainly had a solid bottom; tube 9303 probably did. The date of these tubes should be LM IIIB, since the kylikes belong to Popham's LM IIIB type.13 The jug is paralleled at Kephala Khondrou (LM IIIA-B) where a snake tube painted red was also found.14 GOURNIA The room-sanctuary at Gournia lies at the end of a private road."5 Next to the entrance on the west is a bench along the south wall of the room. Opposite, in the northeast corner, stood a tripod offering table with snake tubes standing around it. Other cult objects-goddesses, birds, snake heads, and a fragment of a pithos with relief double axe and disk decoration-were found in the same area. The three well-preserved snake tubes have one unique feature-a lifting handle topped by a horns of consecration symbol-and, in addition, an extra cult symbol. On tube 1935 (cat. 3; pl. 41, fig. 3) this is a disk. There are two snakes entwined about tube 1936 (cat. 4; pl. 41, fig. 3).

Stone concretion bol attached to the horns of consecration on tube 1937 (cat. 5; pl. 41, fig. 3) is now missing. The birds found in this room appear to be attachments or symbols; it is tempting to imagine that the sym- bol broken off tube 1937 was a bird, since there is a goddess with a bird symbol from Gazi,"1 but there is no proof. Alternatively the double axe might be an attractive choice, but no snake tube or goddess has been found with an attached double axe symbol. Tube 1936 with relief snakes should belong to the goddess with snakes on her arms; the tube with the disk may have belonged to a goddess with disks on her tiara similar to goddessesi 10o42 and 110o43 from Karphi.'7 These three tubes from Gournia have their bottoms broken out, but they were probably once solid; the tops of 1936 and 1937 have a cup-like appearance, while the top surface of 1935 is broken so that it may have originally had a similar appearance. Fragments of two other snake tubes were mentioned in the publication. The base of one (cat. 6; pl. 41, fig. 4) was found standing on the offering table.'" However, it is possible that this is not a snake tube, as its profile is more sharply curved than usual. No trace of the fifth tube could be found, but fragments are listed in the excavation notebook of Harriet Boyd Hawes.19 Here the date is a problem, since no datable pottery was found in connection with the room; 16 Marinatos (supra n. 8) fig.

GESELL [AJA 80 however, the Shrine of the Double Axe at Knossos with two similar pieces of equipment-the tripod table and the goddess-is dated LM IIIB by its pottery.20 Williams's original date of the shrine to the LM I period was based on the lack of evidence of re-occupation in the immediate area. Banti sug- gests that the building was built in LM I, but that the cult equipment dates from LM III."2 Marinatos and Alexiou both date the equipment more exactly to LM IIIB.22 LM IIIB seems the most probable date for the objects; the building, although it may have been part of the LM I town, is close to an area inhabited in LM IIIB,23 and, as it is a separate room off of a separate street, could easily have been re-occupied, even if the surrounding buildings were not. HAGHIA TRIADA Seven tubes came from the room-sanctuary (Building H) at Haghia Triada.24 This building was used in three phases as indicated by three sepa- rate floor levels-one stuccoed floor with painted marine decoration and two later earth floors. The bench which runs along the east wall opposite the door was restuccoed once. The lower parts of three tubes were found on the stucco floor together with three basins, some cups, glass paste, and a frag- ment of gold leaf. The illustrated tube25 from this level, presumably a typical example, had one ring around its bottom. No handles or traces of handles are shown or mentioned. While it is certainly pos- sible that serpentine handles were attached to the missing part of the tube, it is equally possible that this tube resembled the LM IB tubes from Pyrgos, Myrtos. The base of a fourth tube was found on the lower earth floor, and three more tubes, which are described as having horizontal rings26 and serpen- tine handles, stood on the upper earth floor. No attributes are recorded for any of these tubes. The building is dated LM I with re-occupation in LM III. Several other tubes have been found on the site.27 Tube 6771 (cat. 7; pl. 41, fig. 5) was found next to the bottom step of an LM III stair in Room 25 of the village. Two others, one of which was decorated with three parallel red lines, were found in the "casa del lebete," a house built in the LM I period but with a later remodeling, probably LM III. Fragments of other tubes together with sherds dating MM I-LM III came from a trench between the two tholos tombs. Banti suggests that they were from a dump or were washed down the hill from a house higher up. Nothing very specific can be said about the tubes from Haghia Triada, since the final publication has never come out and only one tube (6771) is available for study. It is, however, probable that all the tubes with serpentine handles from Haghia Triada date from the LM III period. KANNIA A still different group of snake tubes was found in a sanctuary complex in a villa at Kannia near Gortyn.28 The complex contained at least five rooms. One or possibly two were room-sanctuaries while the others served as an anteroom and store- rooms. Room I, probably the main room-sanctuary, has a row of flagstones which served as a bench along the west wall. Four goddesses were found on or in front of the bench; three are known to have had snake attributes; one of these also has a bird attribute. Only the skirt of the fourth survives. At least three snake tubes were found in front of the bench. These tubes have several unique features. Tube 15121 (cat. 9; pl. 42, fig. 8) has a plastic agrimi attached to it; tube 15182 (cat. II; pl. 42, figs. Io, 11; ill. 3) has cut-out decoration in the form of a rectangle and an incurved altar. Another un- usual feature of tubes 15121 and 15182 is their doubled row of serpentine handles (two rows on each side), a feature not found elsewhere. The bot- toms of tubes 15182 and 15183 (cat. 12; pl. 42, fig. 12; ill. 4) were probably solid. Other cult finds in the room include small male and female figurines and a bovine head. Room V was probably both a preparation room and a storeroom, although it could have been an 20 Evans (supra n. I) II 335-44; Mervyn R.

In the south- east corner is a hearth or altar of upright slabs which enclosed ashes, ostrich and limpet eggs. On top were an animal figurine and a dove. The god- desses were found near the west wall, in the middle of the room, and on the south bench. At least one has snakes on her tiara; however, the small goddess with the lifting handle has no attributes. Snake tube 15184 (cat. 13; pl. 43, fig. 13; ill. 5) found next to the north bench has three rectangular cut-outs but no symbols. It probably had a solid bottom (pl. 43, fig. 14). Tube 15123 (cat. 10; pl. 42, fig. 9) from the foot of the south bench has a plastic bull's head attached above two circular cut-outs. It is interesting that a large male figure, probably a votary, was found next to the snake tube with the bull's head."2 Other cult objects found in the room include a plaque with relief sphinxes, female and dove figurines, and a triton shell, three fruitstands, and two stone bowls. Room XV, a long narrow room with a bench along the west wall, contained a goddess with snake attributes, snake tube 15112 (cat. 8; pl. 42, fig. 6; pl. 44, fig. -9; ill. 2) with no attributes, but a completely preserved solid bottom (pl. 42, fig. 7), an offering table with incised horns of consecration, and an incense burner. The snake tube was stand- ing on the northwest corner of the bench while the goddess was face down in the center of the room. Since the room seems too narrow to have been a room-sanctuary, it was possibly a storeroom. Although two other rooms in this complex con- tained cult objects, neither had snake tubes. Room III, an elongated closet, contained fragments of goddesses, palettes, horns of consecration, and a dove, as well as a column-shaped offering table. Room VI, the anteroom, had small female figurines, milk jugs, and other miniature vases in it. The date of the complex is a serious problem.

GESELL [AJA 80 to be LM IIIB. Levi, the excavator, maintains that there was no re-occupation, since the finds were on the same level. The same type of pottery was found with the LM I pithoi in the storerooms west of the shrine and with the cult objects in the shrine. The destruction pottery was the same as that of the second palace at Phaistos and the villa at Haghia Triada. Although there are differences between the goddesses from Kannia and those at Gazi and Karphi, there are so many similarities in style that it is difficult to accept a difference in time of two hundred years. The snake tubes too, although with some unique features, have the canonical form. If the stirrup jar found in Room V is not LM IIIB, much revision in pottery dates must take place. Perhaps it is best to reserve further discus- sion until the remainder of the snake tubes have been presented. KARPHI Snake tubes were uncovered in several rooms on this site, although none came from the main shrine, the Temple (Room i and annexes).32 This may be due to chance, for Room I contained a cult bench and five goddesses. It may have been hypaethral. This is particularly interesting as a similar area (Room I6-I7)" identified by the excavators as an open court seems to have been the same type of shrine. Stones laid along the west wall could have been the cult bench, for fragments of goddesses and "other cult objects" as well as fragments of a conch shell and a figurine were found in this area (16). In the east part of the court (17) fragments of a snake tube were found. The arms, hand, part of the skirt of a goddess together with a fragment of a snake tube and part of a clay plaque were found in Room 7034 which, built directly in back of Room 16-17, probably served as a storeroom for the shrine. The fragments are not described except that the tube from Room 70 is ridged.35 The other tubes from Karphi were found to- gether in the southeast corner of Room 58 in the Priest's House.36 This room, which is independent of the rest of the house, has a natural rock projec- tion in its northwest corner which could have served as the cult bench. Neither tube is exactly canonical. One (cat. 15; pl. 43, fig. I7) is rectangular in sec- tion with the canonical loop handles; the other (cat. 14; pl. 43, fig. i6) is tubular but with only one pair of horizontal handles. The rectangular object appears to have had a circular opening with a raised ridge around it in the center of its bottom; the tube may have had a solid bottom. No further cult objects were found in this room. The date of all the Karphi tubes is LM IIIC, and thus they may have been the latest snake tubes in use. KATSAMBA Two snake tubes were found in a room-sanctuary attached to a private house."' The tubes (cat. 16; pl. 41, fig. 5) were standing in front of a stone bench consisting of two slabs resting on three up- rights. These tubes have no attributes but were painted red. Their bottoms must have been open. An incense burner, two cups, and a pyxis were stored under the bench. The date is LM IIIB-C. KEPHALA KHONDROU Only one snake tube was found on this site.3 Its exact find-spot has not yet been published, but Platon, the excavator, has kindly communicated the following information.39 This tube together with fragments of cups "such as are usually found in sanctuaries" was lying in the middle of the pi- shaped corridor Z1, rather near the west wall. An LM IIHA painted jug fragment was also found in the area. Nearby, a conical rhyton was found partly in corridor Z, and partly in the south corner of eO in a disturbed layer. Below this disturbed layer were a heap of cups and two legs of an offering table. The small head of an idol together with part of the rhyton was in corridor Z1.

The shrine must have been on the upper floor. A parturient female figurine published as com- ing from A, may also have been connected with the shrine. The snake tube (cat. 17; pl. 43, fig. 18) has no attributes, but it was painted red and proba- bly had a solid bottom. The published pottery from the site is LM IIIA-B. KOUMASA Two snake tubes (originally published as four) were found here in a sanctuary complex of several rooms.4" The main room had a flagged floor with a column base and a row of stones in the back which may have been a bench.41 One of the snake tubes, still standing but with its top broken off, was found together with a cone-shaped object, a steatite of- fering bowl, and a stone pulley.42 This snake tube, described as "broad," must have been the lower part, 5004 (cat. 19; pl. 44, fig. 19). Its top, 5005, and the top of a second tube, 5002 (cat. i8; pl. 41, fig. 2) were found in a nearby room. The find- spots of the bottom of the second tube, 5003, and a fragment of a rectangular terracotta offering table are not given. Tube 5002-3 has no attributes; tube 5004-5 is decorated with black paint in bands and stylized octopus tentacles. Both probably had solid bottoms. The stone offering bowl and the terracotta of- fering table are similar to those found in the MM II sanctuary at Phaistos.43 However, Xanthoudides recognized that the snake tubes belonged to the LM period. The decoration on tube 5004-5, similar to that on LM IIIB stirrup jars, places the date more closely.44 PRINIAS Five snake tubes were found in two campaigns together with at least five goddesses with up-raised hands.45 The area in which they were discovered was so badly destroyed that no architecture could be associated with them. Most of the snake tubes (cat. 21-24; pl. 44, fig. 20; pl. 45, fig. 21) from this site have open bottoms. One tube, 1939 (cat. 20; pl. 44, fig. 19), probably had a solid bottom. One has three evenly spaced rows of serpentine handles; two have plastic rings all the way up the tube; two have plastic snakes; one of these also has in- cised snakes and cut-out decoration. Two separate arms, possibly from the same goddess, have plastic snakes attached. The tubes and goddesses must be LM IIIB-C, for sherds of this date have been found on the site and the goddesses have features parallel to those from Gazi and Karphi.4 ORIGINS Before conclusions can be drawn from this sur- vey, the theories concerning the origin of the snake tube should be discussed. Evans has suggested that it was derived from the shape of the MM IA drain pipes at Knossos,47 which have two pairs of op- posing loop handles; however, these are not con- nected, the only ring is near the neck, and the bot- toms are, of necessity, open. Evans felt that, since in reality snakes are often found close to or in drain pipes, this association provided the inspira- tion for the snake tubes. However there is a chrono- logical gap in addition to the physical differences. The Neo-Palatial tubes from the snake cult deposit, which Evans also connected with the snake tubes, have a ringed, solid bottom, but they are handleless and have three or four cups attached to their cylin- ders.48 Thus there certainly cannot be any con- tinuity of development from the drain pipes to the canonical snake tubes by way of the tubes of the snake cult deposit.

GESELL [AJA 80 tities of fragments from such tubes were scattered all over the site and in particular the dump. Al- though these are tubes and have vertical loops, almost serpentine on one model, they have a much greater diameter in proportion to their height than the Minoan tubes and all apparently had open bot- toms. They have rectangular windows and are identified as incense burners. Separate doves were found on this site, several with a hole in the stump- like foot for attachment. Although it is not certain to what type of object they were attached, two sepa- rate handles with holes matching those in the doves suggest that the doves might have been attached to these handles with a wooden peg. Their date, ap- proximately the eighteenth and seventeenth cen- turies B.C., is much earlier than the Minoan tubes. The Near Eastern tubes which are most similar to the Minoan snake tubes are those from Beth Shan Level V (pl. 45, fig. 25)." These have splayed bases with rings around them and rings around their tops, but only one pair of vertical loop han- dles. Several have windows with birds perched in them as well as birds perched on the handles. Snakes are climbing up the cylinder toward the birds. Similar objects are the sacred "boxes," rectan- gular in section,52 which also have vertical loop handles, snakes, and birds, and the stepped shrine houses, which have people and animals as well. The Beth Shan tubes, dated Iooo-85o B.C. by Kenyon,53 are either contemporary with or slightly later than the Karphi tubes and certainly later than the other Minoan examples; consequently, while the Minoan tubes might have influenced the Beth Shan exam- ples, there can be no question of formative influ- ence. In fact, although a few fragments of tubes exist from the earlier temple Level VI, ca. 150o-iooo B.C.,54 the best preserved example has a bell-shaped bottom and is less similar to the Minoan tubes than the later ones. The publisher of the Beth Shan tubes suggested that they were flower pots,55 illustrating his theory with representations of flower pots on Mesopotamian cylinder seals.5 None of these has any close similarity to the Minoan snake tubes and they are earlier in date. He admits that the later cylindrical representations developed into incense stands. An Egyptian source was suggested by Williams57 who thought that the snake tube originated in the cylinder stand which, occasionally with a top and bottom ring but no handles, appears in every pe- riod of Egyptian history. It is common in tomb and temple reliefs, but pottery and stone examples have also survived (pl. 45, fig. 26)."58 They usually supported bowls and table tops, but some supported incense burners." None of the cylinders exactly resembles the Minoan snake tube. However the Near Eastern and Egyptian examples give an indi- cation of the various uses of a cylindrical vessel in the Bronze Age. Much more likely to have influenced the design of the canonical snake tube are the cylinders found in an LM IB context at Pyrgos, Myrtos (pl. 44, fig. 22).6o None of these has the canonical serpen- tine handles, but the ringed base and top are already present. The row of loop handles is beginning to develop, although it appears on only one side of the tube. The largest tube has relief bands forming serpentine curves, possibly representing snakes. Other types of decoration include chevrons and pie crust, but there are no other symbols. One tube has a disk inserted to make a solid bottom illustrat- ing what may have been the condition of the missing bottoms of the canonical snake tubes (pl. 44, fig. 23). Another tube has an interesting top which is cut obliquely around the inner circum- ference to allow a conical cup or bowl to rest on it (pl. 44, fig. 24). This tube must, therefore, have been a stand for holding offering bowls, which is 51 Alan Rowe, The Four Canaanite Temples of Beth-Shan: Part I, The Temples and Cult Objects (Philadelphia 1940) 38-42. 52 Perhaps similar to the rectangular "snake tube" from Karphi (cat. 15). 53 Kathleen M.

Unfortunately the deposit had fallen from the second floor, so that the type of room in which the tubes were used is unknown. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the previous discussion it is pos- sible to form several conclusions about the use and date of the Minoan snake tube. The suggestion that the tubes served as aniconic idols can be eliminated because the tube is found together with the anthropomorphic goddess with up-raised hands. That it served as a flower pot does not seem logical because several tubes had no traces of any bottom, and the cut-out decoration on the Kannia tubes renders them unsuitable for this purpose. Nor is there any reason to think that the tubes were snake shelters, for the Beth Shan tubes on which this the- ory was based are bird shelters rather than snake shelters.62 Although snakes appear on three of the tubes, different symbols appearing on others are not connected with snakes. Often a particular tube can be connected by find-spot, type of clay or paint, or attribute to a particular goddess and quite likely was made as the cult vessel for that goddess. So, for example, it is probable that the tubes with relief snakes belonged to the goddesses with relief snakes, the attribute on the tube identifying the goddess or the aspect of the goddess, to whom the tube be- longed. Each tube may then have held offerings for its respective goddess. Perhaps they held cups or bowls like Egyptian offering stands (pl. 45, fig. 26), since coarseware cups and bowls were found with the tubes at Kannia (pl. 43, fig. 15) and Kephala Khondrou. Perhaps they received liquid libations, although the Kannia and Prinias tubes with cut-out decoration and the bottomless tubes from Kat- samba and Prinias are unsuitable for this.63 Perhaps they held incense burners like the Near Eastern cylinders or perhaps the type of offering varied de- pending on the goddess to whom it was made. Their dating still cannot be settled with finality. The majority are certainly LM III, either through their associated pottery or their painted decoration. The tubes with serpentine handles from Haghia Triada, although still of uncertain date, are no earlier than LM IIIA and possibly LM IIIB. The tubes from Kannia which have been dated to the LM IB destruction layer from the associated pot- tery pose a serious problem. The stirrup jar which is also part of their associated pottery, must be LM IIIB. While it is true that the Kannia snake tubes and goddesses have some features which ap- pear at no other site, in other respects they are ex- tremely similar to the LM IIIB and C examples. A one to two hundred year gap seems improbable. Perhaps future discoveries will add further evi- dence to clarify the dating. At the present time it seems likely that the canonical Minoan snake tube is a LM III development. It is a characteristic of the Minoan room-sanctuary, the shrine of the goddess with up-raised hands. On the basis of evidence combined from the arrangement of the finds in the shrine at Gazi, Room I at Kannia, and Room 16-17 at Karphi, it would seem that the goddesses stood on the bench, with the snake tubes and other of- fering vessels resting on the floor in front of them.

XXII). 62 Evans (supra n. i) IV 167 misinterpreted the figures in the windows as snakes, so he thought that they were snake shelters. 63 Although there may be a chthonic aspect to the cult, it is not likely that such offerings would be made in room-sanctu- aries with plaster or hard-packed dirt floors. 64The following abbreviations are used in the catalogue: Gournia: Hawes (supra n. 6).
