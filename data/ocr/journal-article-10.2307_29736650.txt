Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007 Abstract Data from the Minnesota Breast Cancer Family Study cohort (n = 6,130 women) were used to examine the association of type II diabetes with mammographie percent density and incident breast cancer (BC). Exposures and out? comes were self-reported. The first set of analyses evaluated diabetes (DM) as a risk factor for breast cancer. A total of 403 women (6.6%) reported a diagnosis of type II diabetes and 333 women reported an incident breast cancer. Women who reported type II diabetes had an age-adjusted relative risk (RR) for breast cancer of 1.44 (95% CI 0.89-2.32) compared to those who did not. Adjustment for covariates strength? ened the association (RR 1.61,95% CI 0.98-2.62). Mammograms were retrieved on women over the age of 40 and percent density was estimated with T. A. Sellers (E) ?

Cross-sec? tional analyses revealed that mean levels of mammographie density were not statistically significantly different between diabetic and non diabetic women. Results were similar within strata of menopausal status. Breast cancer cases with diabetes did not have a significantly higher percent density than cases without diabetes. Our findings suggest that breast cancer risk may be increased among women with type II diabetes, but that type II diabetes does not significantly influence mammographie breast density. Keywords Cohort ? Risk factor * Menopause Introduction The hypothesis that diabetes may influence risk of breast cancer has been examined in multiple studies to date [1-10]. A recent review noted that diabetes was not associated with significantly increased risk in case-control studies (Summary odds ratio of 1.13; 95% CI 0.7-1.9), but a slightly stronger and statistically significant risk in cohort studies was evident (Summary relative risk of 1.25; 95% CI 1.19-1.31) [11]. However, there were important sources of heterogeneity across studies with regard to adjustment for potential confounders, and differential findings by meno? pausal status. Because diabetes and impaired &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="2">506 Cancer Causes Control (2007) 18:505-515 fasting glucose together affect more than 25% of Americans above the age of 50 years, even a moderate causal association could account for more than 10% of primary colon, endometrium, pancreas, liver, and breast malignancies [12]. Thus, additional studies of this potential associ? ation are warranted, particularly among women already at elevated risk because of a family history of breast cancer. The precise mechanism(s) through which type II diabetes may increase risk of breast cancer is unknown, but impaired regulation of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathways has been suspected [11]. Meta-analyses suggest a 65-74% increased risk among women with higher circulating IGF-I levels, but only for pre-meno pausal breast cancer [13-15]. Most studies have not found either serum IGF-1 or IGFBP-3 to be a risk factor for post-menopausal breast cancer. Adjustment for serum IGFBP-3 or the IGF l:IGFBP-3 ratio generally demonstrated an atten? uation of the IGF-1-breast cancer relationship [16-18], but strengthened in one case [19]. One subsequent study found a strong increased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women &lt; 50 in the highest tertile of serum IGF-1 (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.5) [20] and another reported possible synergism between insulin resistance and both serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in a dose response fashion [21]. Recent findings based on the EPIC cohort suggest that IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels are associated with postmenopausal, but not premenopausal breast cancer [22]. Interest? ingly, the latest analyses from the Nurses Health Study do not show an association of these two factors with premenopausal breast cancer [23], so our understanding of IGF's and their binding proteins in relation to breast cancer risk remains uncertain [24]. Mammographie breast density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer, with a difference in risk of four to six times higher in women with densities in the highest categories, as compared to women in the lowest density categorizations [25]. Established risk factors for percent density could mediate their effect through an influence on hormonal exposures (e.g., body mass index, par? ity, hormone replacement therapy, and late age at first birth) [25-28]. However, there is increasing evidence that the IGF pathway may also be influencing percent density levels [29-33]: In particular, serum levels of IGF-1 or the IGF l:IGFBP-3 ratio are positively associated with breast density, while IGFBP-3 is inversely asso? ciated with PD in the majority of these studies. Similar to the data on breast cancer, these associations are most evident among pre-meno pausal women. To our knowledge, the only study that has examined IGF-1 staining at the tissue level found positive associations with PD, but this too was limited to pre-menopausal women [34]. Taken together, this evidence suggests the hypothesis that diabetes could affect breast can? cer risk, at least in part, through the influence of insulin or IGFs on breast tissue morphology as reflected on the mammogram. A small study of Native American women found that diabetes was inversely associated with subjective measures of mammographie density, but only among pre menopausal women [35]. The present report examines the association of type II diabetes with mammographie breast density and breast cancer in the Minnesota Breast Cancer Family Study. Results may inform our understanding of the biological basis through which mammographie density influences risk. Methods Population Details of the baseline [36] and first follow-up [37] (FUI) phase of the Minnesota Breast Cancer Family study cohort have been previously de? scribed. An overview of the study, including the aspects of data collection relevant to the current report, is shown in Table 1. Briefly, a family study of breast cancer was initiated in 1944 at the University of Minnesota. Breast cancer probands were women ascertained at the Tumor Clinic of the University of Minnesota Hospital between 1944 and 1952 (n = 544). From 1990 to 1996, 426 (78%) families were updated; each proband's first and second degree female relatives and spouses (marry-in) of male relatives were contacted, and extensive risk factor data were collected by telephone interview on 6,194 women. ?

Questionnaires were mailed to all female blood relatives and spouses of male blood relatives in the 426 pedigrees who completed the first follow-up survey. Of the 6,194 eligible women from the first follow-up, 604 were deceased (9.8%), 654 were lost to follow-up (10.6%), 1,109 refused (17.9%), and 84 required a next of kin (1.4%) to complete the question? naire. A total of 3,743 women completed the 2001 questionnaire, giving a response rate of 77.1% of those contacted and competent to complete a survey, and an overall participation rate of 67.0% of those who participated in the first follow-up and were not known to be deceased in 2001. Data collection At the first follow-up (FUI), telephone interviews were completed with 94.6% of eligible female relatives over the age of 18 years. Specific topics covered included: history of cancer, weight his? tory, marital status, education, occupational class, medical history including benign or malignant breast disease, menopausal status, mammography, diabetes diagnosis and the corresponding age of onset, menstrual and pregnancy history, oral contraceptive use, physical activity, lifetime fre? quency of smoking and alcohol intake. Data on current height, weight, circumferences of the waist (two inches above the umbilicus) and hips (maximal protrusion) as well as weight history were obtained by mail according to a validated protocol [38]. The second follow-up questionnaire (FU2) ascertained updated cancer events and medical conditions including diabetes. Mammographie density estimation As part of both follow-up surveys, females over the age of 40 years were asked to provide permission for study investigators to review a recent mammogram if one was available. If they had never had a mammogram or were due to have one, they were asked to obtain a new one through their personal physician. The study covered the costs if the subject lacked adequate health insur? ance. Among the age-eligible women at the time of FUI (n = 5,219), mammograms from 2491 (47.8%) were returned to the coordinating center ?} Springer</page><page sequence="4">508 Cancer Causes Control (2007) 18:505-515 within the time period allocated for collection. Of the 3,482 age-eligible women at FU2, 87% pro? vided authorization to retrieve their mammo grams. Mammograms from FU2 were retrieved and scanned on 2,070 (69%) women; the remain? ing 31% were either unavailable (11%) or not requested within the time period allocated for mammogram collection (20%). For the current study, we selected the mammo? gram from the date closest to the date of first follow-up (FUI), as this coincided with the timing of data collection for most of the potential confounding variables. Subjects who reported a history of breast cancer prior to the date of mammogram were excluded from cross sectional analyses (n = 97). Thus, a total of 2,530 mediolat eral oblique (MLO) views and 1,818 craniocaudal (CC) views were available for analyses; the smaller number of CC views reflects the later addition of this to the protocol. Over 92% of the mammo? grams available were taken within five years of the FUI survey; 67% occurred within one year or less. Mammograms from FUI were digitized at the University of Minnesota on a Lumiscan 200 scan? ner; only the left MLO was digitized on each woman. For mammograms obtained at the Mayo Clinic for FU2, both the left CC and MLO views were digitized on a Lumiscan 75 scanner with 12-bit grayscale depth. The pixel size was 0.130 x 0.130 mm2 for both the 18 x 24 cm2 and 24 x 30 cm2 films. The right views were digitized if the left were not available. Batch files were created randomizing the views within each woman, when appropriate. Percent mammographie breast den? sity (dense area divided by total area x 100) and absolute dense area (cm2) were estimated for each view using a computer-assisted thresholding pro? gram (Cumulus) [39,40]. All images were read by a single trained technician who has consistently demonstrated high reliability (r &gt; 0.90) while reading over 500 duplicate images across varying time frames. As expected, the correlation between the CC and MLO views was high (r = 0.88). Identification of breast cancer cases A total of 333 incident breast cancer cases were self-reported with an age of first diagnosis. In an earlier validation study, 136 of 138 (98.6%) self-reported breast cancers were confirmed with pathology reports [37]. There were 115 women who reported a breast cancer at FUI only, 98 who reported at FU2 only, and 120 women who reported cancer at both times. Of those with two reported ages, 49% were identical and 96% were within six years of each other (median difference 1.0 year). The earliest reported age of breast cancer diagnosis was used for analysis. No data were available regarding invasiveness or hormone receptor status of the tumors. Identification of diabetes cases Incident diabetes mellitus and age of diagnosis were self-reported at both follow-up times. Based on precedent in the literature, a cutoff of age 30 years was used to distinguish type II from type I diabetes [1, 7, 10, 41]. A total of 472 women reported a history of type II diabetes. We excluded 45 cases with onset before age 30, three cases who reported a diabetes diagnosis at FUI but not at FU2, and 21 who reported onset of diabetes subsequent to onset of breast cancer. This left 403 women classified as having type II diabetes and being at risk of breast cancer. Of the 128 women that indicated a history of diabetes diagnosis at both FUI and FU2, 42 (33%) reported consistent ages at diagnosis, 4 (3%) did not provide an age at diagnosis at FU2, and 82 (64%) provided inconsistent ages. For the four women who did not provide an age of diagnosis at FU2, the age of diagnosis at FUI was used. Five women reported a new diagnosis of diabetes at FU2 but did not provide the age. For these women, the median age between FUI and FU2 was used. For women with differences in reported ages of diagnosis, the median difference was 2.0 years. Identification of menopausal status and age at menopause To determine menopausal status, women were asked at each survey if they had experienced a period within the last 12 months. If no periods were reported, patients were asked for the age at which menstrual periods stopped and the reason their periods stopped. Only those who reported 4y Springer</page><page sequence="5">Cancer Causes Control (2007) 18:505-515 509 natural menopause, surgical menopause, or 'no known reason why periods stopped' were consid? ered postmenopausal. Family history of breast cancer As in past analyses of this cohort, family history was defined based on the relationship to the closest degree of relative with a breast cancer, leading to three defined categories: first-degree, second-degree, and those related only by mar? riage [42]. Women in the marry-in category represent the general population risk of incident breast cancer. Statistical analysis Associations between diabetes and breast cancer were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Risk ratios and 95% confi? dence intervals were calculated for this potential risk factor as well as for other risk factors and confounders. The timing of breast cancer events was modeled as a function of age, because age is a better predictor of breast cancer risk in this cohort than length of follow-up [43]. This was done using the counting style of data organization developed by Therneau [44, 45]. Diabetes was included in all models as a time-dependent variable. That is, diabetic women contributed "unexposed" person-time prior to age of diabetes diagnosis and "exposed" person-time from the self-reported age of diabetes diagnosis until age of incident breast cancer or censoring. Women were censored at the age of breast cancer, age at most recent contact, or date of death. Analyses were conducted in which the start of person-time accrual began at two different ages: age 18 years and age 30 years. The results were virtually identical. However, since we restricted diabetes onset to occur after age 30 years, only results based on accrual from age 30 years are presented. For postmenopausal analyses, person-time began accumulating at the reported age of menopause. Potential confounders were evaluated, includ? ing those listed in Table 2. Final models were adjusted for family history, a combined parity and age at first birth variable (nulliparous, 1-2 children &lt;20 years of age, 1-2 children &gt;20 years Table 2 Distribution of breast cancer risk factors at baseline by Type II Diabetes Mellitus status Variable Type II diabetes melitus status3 Yes No (n = 403) (n = 5,727) Family history of breast cancer 1st Degree relative 78 (19) 839 (15) 2nd Degree relative 145 (36) 2,322 (41) Marry-in 180 (45) 2,566 (45) Age at Menarche mean 12.7 (1.6) 13.0 (1.6) (SD) Parity/Age of first birth Nulliparous 35 (9) 691 (12) 1-2 births &lt; 20 years of age 21 (5) 511 (9) 1-2 births &gt; 20 years of age 78 (19) 1,620 (28) 3+ births &lt; 20 years of age 111 (28) 1,205 (21) 3+ births &gt; 20 years of age 157 (39) 1,685 (29) Missing 1 (0) 15 (0) Oral contraceptive use Ever 134 (33) 2,998 (52) Never 265 (66) 2,710 (47) Missing 4 (1) 19 (0) Age at menopause (years) 47.8 (7.6) 46.5 (7.6) mean (SD) Hormone replacement therapy Ever 115 (29) 2,002 (35) Never 284 (70) 3,690 (64) Missing 4 (1) 35 (1) Alcohol consumption Never 111 (28) 873 (15) Monthly 244 (61) 3,450 (60) Weekly 43 (11) 1,136 (20) Daily 3 (1) 251 (4) Missing 2 (0) 17 (0) Physical activity Low 189 (47) 1,978 (35) Moderate 110 (27) 1,807 (32) High 104 (26) 1,942 (34) Education level attained No High School Diploma 117 (29) 1,134 (20) High School Graduate 165 (41) 2,048 (36) Vocational School or some 93 (28) 1,705 (30) College College graduate 27 (7) 824 (14) Information missing 1 (0) 16 (0) Pack-years of smoking Never 247 (61) 3,027 (53) &lt;20 pack years history 55 (14) 1,397 (24) &gt;20 pack years history 100 (25) 1,269 (22) Missing 1 (0) 34 (1) Body mass index mean 31.1 (SD 6.4) 26.2 (SD 5.3) (kg/m2) n = 4,565 mean (SD) Body mass index quartiles 1 &lt;22.5 17 (4) 1,086 (19) 2 22.5 &lt; x &lt; 25.3 29 (7) 1,035 (18) 3 25.3 &lt; x &lt; 29.0 78(19) 1,030(18) ?} Springer</page><page sequence="6">510 Cancer Causes Control (2007) 18:505-515 Table 2 continued Variable Type II diabetes melitus status3 Yes No (n = 403) (n = 5,727) 4 &gt;29.0 168 (42) 1,081 (19) Missing 111 (28) 1,495 (26) Greatest weight (pounds) mean 181.6 (40.5) 154.3 (30.7) (SD) Greatest weight (quartiles?pounds) 1 &lt;134.0 19(5) 1,140(20) 2 134.0 &lt; x &lt; 149.7 43 (11) 1,068 (19) 3 149.7 &lt; x &lt; 172.6 87 (22) 1,161 (20) 4 &gt;172.6 151 (37) 1,025 (18) Missing 103 (26) 1,333 (23) Height?mean in inches (SD) 63.5 (2.5) 64.0 (2.7) Greatest weight?BMI mean 31.6 (6.5) 26.6 (5.2) (SD) Quintiles 1 &lt;22.5 9(2) 914(16) 2 22.5 &lt; x &lt; 24.7 25 (6) 898 (16) 3 24.7 &lt; x &lt; 21.1 39 (10) 884 (15) 4 27.1 &lt; x &lt; 30.8 83 (21) 830 (14) 5 &gt;30.8 144(36) 789(14) Missing 103 (26) 1,412 (25) Values presented as number (percent) unless otherwise indicated a Type 2 (age onset &lt; 30 years) determined by self-report at FUI or FU2 of age, 3+ children &lt;20 years of age, or 3+ children &gt;20 years of age), age at menarche (continuous), education (no diploma, completed high school, some college, college graduate), HRT use (ever/never), oral contraceptive use (ever/never), alcohol use (never, monthly, weekly, daily), physical activity (low, moderate, high), and greatest-weight BMI (quintiles). Be? cause there were several anthropomorphic vari? ables, including height, weight at ages 18, 30, 40, 50, and weight at time of interview, we created a greatest weight and greatest-BMI variable (cor? responding to greatest reported weight). To minimize exclusion of subjects because of missing data, a "missing" category was created for certain variables. We conducted secondary analyses to evaluate the potential impact this may have had using BMI, since it is strongly associated with mammographie density and diabetes; results were virtually identical. The association between diabetes and percent density was evaluated using linear models ap? proaches implemented in PROC GLM in SAS. Analyses were performed for all women com? bined and stratified by menopausal status at time of mammography. Diabetes and menopausal status at the time of mammogram was determined by comparing the self-reported ages for each to the age at mammogram. Because being diabetic for a longer period could result in stronger associations, we also performed post-hoc strati? fied analyses by time in years since diabetes diagnosis (a median split). Results are presented adjusted for age and BMI (simple model) and for all variables previously reported to be associated with percent density (see Table 3). Results are also presented separately for CC and MLO mammogram views. Results After exclusions, among the cohort of women at risk, 333 breast cancers and 403 cases of type II diabetes were reported through 246,413 person years of follow-up. A total of 16 women reported onset of Type II diabetes prior to diagnosis of breast cancer. Table 2 shows the characteristics of women in the study by type II diabetes status. Diabetic women were less active, less educated, less likely to have used hormone replacement and had higher BMI than non-diabetics in the cohort. Women who reported type II diabetes had an age-adjusted relative risk (RR) for breast cancer of 1.44 (95% CI 0.89-2.32) compared to those who did not (Table 3). After adjustment for potential confounders (Table 2), the magnitude of association between diabetes and incident breast cancer was higher, but still of borderline statistical significance. Most of the breast cancers occurred among diabetics who never used hor? mone replacement therapy. When analyses were restricted to postmenopausal women only, diabe? tes was positively associated with incident breast cancer, although the association was somewhat attenuated. There were too few cases of pre? menopausal breast cancer among diabetics to derive meaningful estimates of risk. ?

The first analysis was a cross-sectional comparison of type II diabetics versus non-diabetics, regardless of breast cancer status (Table 4). After adjustment for age, men? opausal status, and BMI, mammographie percent density levels did not differ between women with and without diabetes in either CC or MLO views (all p &gt; 0.5). Further comparisons were made within strata defined by menopausal status (Table 4) and median time since diagnosis of diabetes (data not shown), but no differences were apparent. Linear models using the absolute amount of dense breast tissue (in cm2) instead of percentages yielded similar results. Finally, an exploratory analysis was performed to compare the mean density of the 42 breast cancer cases (prior to their diagnosis) by diabetes status. After adjustment for age, menopausal status, and BMI, mammographie percent density levels did not differ between these groups of cases with and without diabetes in either CC (Diabetes posi? tive = 28.7% vs. diabetes negative = 27.4%) or MLO views (Diabetes positive = 28.2% vs. dia? betes negative = 27.6%), but the confidence intervals around the differences in means pre? cludes meaningful interpretation. Discussion The current study sought to assess whether Type II diabetes was a risk factor for breast cancer, and if so, whether some of that risk may be evident in differences in mammographie density. Results suggest that type II diabetes is associated with a modest but potentially important increased risk of Table 4 Mean levels of mammographie percent density by diabetes, view, and level of adjustment Pre-menopausal Post-menopausal Total N Simple3 Fullb n Simplea Fullb n Simple3 Fullb CC view Diabetes 16 32.3(3.60) 30.6(3.72) 84 19.5(1.42) 20.9(1.55) 100 22.7(1.34) 22.8(2.05) No Diabetes 448 32.0 (0.69) 31.0 (1.23) 1,270 20.6 (0.38) 20.0 (2.09) 1718 23.5 (0.33) 23.5 (1.57) MLO view Diabetes 22 33.4 (3.04) 35.6 (0.67) 139 20.9 (1.04) 24.5 (2.57) 161 23.8 (1.01) 26.1 (2.27) No Diabetes 564 32.2 (0.60) 34.3 (2.93) 1,805 21.2 (0.30) 24.4 (2.37) 2369 23.8 (0.27) 25.7 (2.06) a Least squares means and corresponding standard errors, adjusted for age, age squared, menopausal status (Total sample only), and greatest BMI b Also adjusted for age at menarche, parity/births, activity level, alcohol use, education, family history of breast cancer, oral contraceptive use (ever/never), and HRT use (ever/never) ?

Adjustment for potential confounding factors increased the magnitude of risk, but the results were only marginally statis? tically significant. This is likely due to limited power. However, mammographie breast density levels did not differ by diabetes status, either among the entire cohort or within strata defined by menopausal status. As recently reviewed [11], the evidence impli? cating diabetes as a risk factor for cancer is stronger in prospective than retrospective studies, with a summary relative risk of 1.25 (95% CI 1.19-1.31). Findings from our study are consistent with this estimate, albeit slightly higher. It is worth reiterating that our cohort is enriched for women who are blood related to a breast cancer proband, and therefore have a family history of the disease. We were interested in whether diabetes in the face of a potential genetic suscep? tibility background would pose more dramatic risk effects, but the limited number of breast cancer events precluded the ability to fit these models. It is also important to note that the estimate of risk increased by about 10% with adjustment for potential confounding factors, underlying the importance of these data in accounting for variability in findings across pre? vious studies. Despite the suggestive trend observed for diabetes and cancer risk in the current study, there was no evidence that mammographie den? sity levels differed by diabetes status. To the best of our knowledge, only one previous study by Robidoux and colleagues [35] has examined this topic. Their report, based on a sample of south? western Native American women, found that women with diabetes had significantly decreased breast density, but only among the pre-meno? pausal subset. The current study found virtually identical levels of mammographie percent density for both pre- and post-menopausal women. Rea? sons for the discrepant findings are not immedi? ately apparent. Both study populations were comprised of similar proportions of pre- and post-menopausal women, although our sample size was over 13-fold larger. That study catego? rized breast density using the categorical BIR ADS classification, whereas the current study employed a quantitative measure. The results between our studies may reflect differences in ethnicity between the sample populations, but the most important difference could relate to the fact that onset of diabetes among Native American women tends to occur significantly earlier than what is typically observed among Caucasians. This would be expected to mean that Native American women cycle through to insulin insuf? ficiency at a much younger age, potentially influencing breast changes earlier in life. Since the present study had a limited proportion of pre? menopausal women, this hinders the ability to fully compare the studies. Strengths of the study include the prospective design, the careful manner in which mammo? graphie density was estimated, and the availability of data on most of the important confounding factors that could influence an association be? tween diabetes and the two outcomes of interest. An earlier validation study of breast cancer in this cohort suggests nearly perfect agreement (98.6%) between self-reports and medical record [37]. The absence of any strong association between diabetes and mammographie density prompted us to scrutinize our design and analyses, as this may inform the validity of the hypothesized underly? ing mechanisms. The data on diabetes were self reported and validation with medical records was not attempted. It is well accepted that diabetes is under ascertained in the general population and we relied on age at onset to discriminate type I from type II diabetes. Since roughly 90% of diabetes cases are type II and type I rarely has onset after age 30, it is unlikely that we have misclassified the type of diabetes, but some women with diabetes were likely misclassified as unaffected. This would be expected to be random across case status and breast density and there? fore reduce the ability to detect differences. The data were collected at several time points and inconsistencies in the primary exposure and endpoints were noted. Although the analysis only considered women with consistent reports on diabetes and breast cancer status, some true cases were probably excluded. This reduces power, but the introduction of bias is not likely. The absence of an association between diabe? tes and mammographie density could be real, and ?} Springer</page><page sequence="9">Cancer Causes Control (2007) 18:505-515 513 provide insights regarding the mechanisms through which density increases breast cancer risk. The insulin-like growth factor pathway has been proposed as a mechanism by which diabetes may confer an increased risk of pre-menopausal breast cancer [11]. IGF-1 influences cellular growth and proliferation of breast epithelial and stromal cells in primary culture [46, 47]. Epidem? iologie studies suggest that high levels of IGF-1 are associated with increased risk of breast cancer and higher levels of breast density, but only among pre-menopausal women [29-31, 33]. There are few studies that have examined IGF-I levels in type II diabetes, but recent prospective epi demiologic studies suggest that higher IGF-I levels may actually lower diabetes risk [48, 49]. One study that compared obese diabetics, obese non-diabetics, and lean controls, found that serum IGF-I were elevated among obese women with and without type II diabetes, although only the difference between non-diabetics and controls achieved statistical significance [50]. It is interest? ing to note that obesity increases risk of diabetes and post-menopausal breast cancer, but is inver? sely associated with density and pre-menopausal breast cancer. Taken together, the lack of asso? ciation between diabetes and mammographie density is not entirely unexpected. In summary, the current provides suggestive evidence that self-reported history of adult-onset diabetes is a risk factor for post-menopausal breast cancer. Since diabetes is under-diagnosed, the estimated relative risk from the current study is likely attenuated. This fact, plus the realization that diabetes is a modifiable risk factor that could be targeted among high-risk populations, under? scores the need for additional studies on the association with breast cancer risk. If the associ? ation is real, it could inform strategies for risk reduction, including weight loss, for which evi? dence exists that incidence of breast cancer is reduced [51, 52]. References 1.
