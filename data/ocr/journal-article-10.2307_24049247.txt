After Vysotskaya 1984, fig- 1. reservation, which has become a scholarly com monplace in specialized studies and in popular literature, is readily explicable.24 None of these animals, which are especially abundant in Sasanian art, is ever identified by an inscription, and none appear in any clear cultic context.25 As A. De Jong has rightly put it, when these animals can be explained as Avestan zoo morphic manifestations, they are readily inter preted as such, but when there is no appropriate Avestan explanation, they remain "just animals" and require no further interpretation.26 Thus, a bird of prey is usually seen as a värayna bird, a wild boar is conventionally V3r30rayna (although Sasanian kings are often portrayed killing them in depictions of the royal hunt on silver plates), and a horse is Mithra, Tistrya, or even the same YoroGrayna, depending on the context and the predilection of the interpreter.27 However, the Sasanian bestiary is much broader, including lions, bears, elephants, zebus, roosters, scorpions, deer, and many more. Not only are some of these animals not explained as Zoroastrian sym bols,· they are, in fact, xiafstia—a special category of creatures, the creations of the Evil Spirit. It is plausible that, in some cases, these beasts and birds could indeed be symbolic representa tions of Iranian gods. Moreover, this practice Fig. 2. Lion of Nana on the coin of Sapadbizes. After Tanabe 1995, flg. 2. could be seen as going back to ancient Mesopota mia. Of the forty divine symbols that replaced the anthropomorphic images of deities in Mesopota mia listed by A. Green, fifteen represent real and fantastic beasts, and an additional four are staves ending with animal heads.28 The interpretation of the animals in Iranian art as symbolic representations of divinities appears justified in only a few cases. For instance, a ram decorated with ribbons could indeed represent xvai9nah, based on the evidence from Kär-nämag 1 Ardaslr I Päbagän.29 Another case is that of the earliest image of the goddess Nana in the Eastern Iranian world. On the coins issued by the Indo Scythian rulers Sapadbizes and Agesiles (end of the first century b.c.e.), she is represented only by her animal, a lion, which is identified by the in scription NANAIA (fig. 2).30 It is worth noting that the first images of the god Oeso (opjro) on the early issues of the Kushan king Wima Kadphises are aniconic and repre sent the god by his most recognizable symbols, a trident combined with an axe and a bull.31 The anthropomorphic image of Oeso was created dur ing Wima Kadphises' reign, most likely by incor porating features taken from the iconography of Poseidon, Zeus, and Heracles 32 In most cases the animal symbols may be con nected with totemism.

While sometimes the bust is shown the only possible incarnation of the gods is found bearded, on seals and coins of Xusrö II it has a in many Classical accounts and fully accords with youthful, feminine look. It seems impossible, at the available Iranian sources.60 This phenomenon present, to establish which deity the bust on the adds another aniconic manifestation that perhaps Sasanian coins and seals represents.55 could be labeled "elemental aniconism." Under Kusänsäh Peröz I, the image of a bust Worship of elements and celestial bodies and on the fire altar appears also in Eastern Iranian even deification and anthropomorphization of world.56 To be more precise, there are two busts, natural entities such as rivers and mountains is identified by the inscriptions as the goddess Nana, also attested in Mesopotamia.61 It is possible that who was probably the head of the Kushan royal Iranian aniconism and anthropomorphism owed pantheon, and βαγο βορζανο, "the exalted god" or much to the Mesopotamian heritage.

It was especially predominant in Babylonia from the seventh to the fifth century b.c.e. and in Assyria during the last century of the existence of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.62 In ancient Mesopotamia, the deities were com monly perceived to have a human form and were represented anthropomorphically.63 It is impor tant to note that the two principal gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon, Anu and Enlil, were never portrayed in human shape.64 This avoid ance of pictorial representation is difficult to ex plain, but as T. Oman puts it, "such an absence may indicate an inherent difficulty for Mesopo tamians to giving concrete form through visual images to the conceptual image of a human shaped god . . . while deities were conceived of as personified entities, they were not always thus represented."65 About the reasons behind the re placement of cultic images with non-figural rep resentation, she goes on to conclude that "the reasons for the transformation of the cult image into a non-anthropomorphic icon are highly con jectural, since the ancient records are not explicit about this issue. Thus we can only speculate that it was the awesome sacred status of Mesopota mian deities, or perhaps their sublime splendor, which prevented their visual representations from being viewed by humans."66 It is important to note that Iranians maintained close contact with Assyrians and Babylonians for at least five hundred years before the creation of the Achaemenian Empire and their relations with the Elamites were recently described in terms of "Irano-Elamite acculturation."67 Moreover, the latest study by W. Henkelman has convincingly demonstrated that the religion of Pars in the time recorded by the Persepolis Foundation Archive was essentially an amalgam of heterogeneous Elamite and Iranian cults.68 Some Observations on Anthropomorphism It is impossible to discuss aniconism without also considering anthropomorphism. The de piction of deities in human form in the Iranian world is evident from the Achaemenian period on. The iconographic repertoire of Achaemenian imperial art is rich in human-shaped and therio morphic representations and, in that sense, may indeed be labeled as a successor to the Mesopo tamian and Elamite artistic traditions.69 At the same time, only a few undisputed anthropomor phic renderings of deities are known. The most celebrated and common is, of course, the famous "figure in the winged disk" (fig. 10).70 Scholars have proposed various identifications of this im age.71 However, it appears that there are not suf ficient grounds for doubting that the figure in the winged disk does, in fact, represent Ahura Mazda, the highest god of the Achaemenian kings who is constantly invoked in their royal inscriptions.72 244</page><page sequence="7">η ε ν κ a r : Aniconism in the Religious Art of Pre-Islamic Iran and Central Asia Fig. 10.

In a passage by Al-Jayhäni quoted by Shahrastäni (d. 1153 c.e.), Öhrmazd is said to have created the world in the following manner: "I created the whole of this world from myself. I created the souls of the righteous from the hair of my head; the sky from my brain,· nails and arms (?) from my forehead; the sun from my eye; the moon from my nose,· the stars from my tongue,· Srös and the rest of the angels from my ear; the earth from the tendon of my foot."104 What is evident from these texts, and also from several other places in Pahlavi literature, is that the gods were basically perceived as having hu man form in menög, but their manifestations in the visible world, getlg, usually assumed sym bolic, metaphoric, elemental, and aniconic shape. The idea that the deities do not have an anthro pomorphic representation in the physical plane, which is visible to ordinary people, may have been one of the main theoretical concepts behind the Iranian inclination to represent their divini ties in anthropomorphic form. It is also clear that human-shaped images existed during certain peri ods in some Iranian religions, but there is usually no way of knowing whether this reflects nuances in cult or even religious beliefs. The idea of aniconism as a "primitive" and "ancient" form of worship that preceded figural representation can be definitely put to rest. It is clear that in most cultures, cultic statues co existed with non-figural symbols, and aniconism was just "another way to visualize the divine."105 Conclusions In conclusion, I want to emphasize that the cul tic practices attested among Pre-Islamic Iranians were very diverse. Both "material" and "empty space" aniconism are found, although the most frequent and common is "elemental aniconism." The basic perception of Iranian deities was anthropomorphic. Iranian divinities were always viewed as possessing a human form in menög, but were not always represented in this way in getlg. For instance, the Sasanian cult was probably pre dominantly aniconic, while that of the Kushans and Sogdians included cultic images. At this preliminary stage of research, it seems that aniconic trends were present among Ira nians from the very beginning, reflecting their nomadic origins, ideology, and religious beliefs, but these trends were also inspired by similar de velopments in Mesopotamia, Elam, and Urartu. The influence that these civilizations have had on the formation of Iranian culture has always been acknowledged,106 but the tremendous ex tent of this influence has only recently been fully appreciated. Notes 1. This article is based on a paper delivered at the "7th European Conference of Iranian Studies" (Cra cow, 7-10 September, 2011)." I would like to express my gratitude to Shaul Shaked, Frantz Grenet, and Jean Kellens for their valuable critical comments and sug gestions. I am also grateful to Sam Thrope and Julia Rubanovich for their help in improving this paper. 2. Despite considerable spatial and chronological diversity (especially between eastern and western parts of the Iranian world) it is possible to speak of the pre Islamic Iranian world as a unity sharing a number of common historical, cultural, linguistic, and religious characteristics that could and should be studied as a unified phenomenon. 3.

Nevertheless, the worship of a sword could hardly be considered specifically Iranian, and it is not attested by 249</page><page sequence="12">η ε ν κ a r : Aniconism in the Religious Art of Pre-Islamic Iran and Central Asia any Iranian source. It could potentially be a holdover from the ancient heritage going back to Indo-European unity or borrowed from autochthonous pre-Indo-European peoples. The revering of a sword as an icon of the divine was practiced by Indo-European Thracians, Illyrians, and some Germanic tribes as well as non-Indo-European peoples such as Turks and Huns: Maenchen-Helfen 1973, 278-80; Bessonova 1983, 49. The origin of this cult is difficult to determine. However, it is worth noting that already in early Sumer, divine weapons belonging to the gods were not merely a symbolic representation of the anthropomorphic deity, but were often considered inde pendent deities in their own right. 22. Vanden Berghe and Schippmann 1985, 76-79. 23. On the cult of massebot and Western Semitic aniconism seePatrich 1990; Mettinger 1995; Mettinger 2006, 284-89; Gaifman 2008. Further comparison with Western Semitic material might prove rewarding and illuminating. However it will require a separate study. 24. This is characteristic, for instance, of works of the prominent Soviet scholar Vladimir Lukonin: Luko nin 1977, 159-60; Lukonin 1987, 102; Treverand Luko nin 1987, 56, 91; Loukonine and Ivanov 2003, 26. 25. However, such representations exist in Sogdian art. The only possible exception could be the probable depiction of the worship of Oxus in form of a horse found on the Sogdian funerary couch, known as the "Miho couch," which is dated to the year 570 c.e. This suggestion by P. O. Skjasrvo was accepted by Marshak 2004, 20-21, and Grenet 2007, 410. 26. De Jong 2009, 37. 27. It is worth noting that M. Boyce 1975a, p. 63, n. 276 already pointed out that "it is hardly justifiable to regard every poetic simile or heraldic badge with the boar as referring to this god [VoroOrayna]." Tistriya also shares with VarsOrayna his other two visual manifesta tions—a bull and a young man. 28. Green 1995, fig. 1 and pi. 1. 29. Käi-nämag 1 Ardasii 1 Päbagän 4.11. 30.

However, anthropomorphic imagery was pres ent in Scythian art before the Greeks: Schiltz 1994, 10-11; Ustinova 1999, 21. There are, however, very few images of gods independent of Greek iconography, and given its anepigraphic character, the interpreta tion of Scythian divine iconography is highly prob lematic and unclear. 77. Artamonov 1961, 82; Raevskiy 1977, 178; Raev skiy 1978, 68-69. 78. The male figure in the eagle headdress on the finial from Lysaya Gora is usually identified as a unique image of Papaios: Bessonova 1983, 41-42; Schiltz 1994, p. 182, fig. 133. However, naked and ithyphallic im ages are not found in Iranian divine iconography, and therefore it is hardly possible that it depicts an Iranian divinity. Perhaps it should rather be understood as a depiction of a priest-shaman. 79. Yatsenko 1992, 192. 80.

At least one more Iranian sanctuary, the "Frataraka temple" at Persepolis, also housed a cultic statue of the Greek type. Its marble fragments were uncovered by Iranian archaeologists in recent excavations: Callieri 2007, 61-62. On the Iranian temples in the Hellenistic period see Shenkar 2011. 87.

Another example is the chariot drawn by birds closely resembling roosters (Frye 1971, no. 68), who are the animals of Sraosa, and therefore this could be the image of this god.
