<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEOLOGIANS IN ISLAM From Die Philosophie des Islam by MAX HORTEN Translated from the German by V. June Hager In Islamic theology (even more in Islamic religion) all the various components of Oriental culture come into play. Here we find prehis toric ingredients (dynamism, animism, the astral dimension) along with historical elements (Judaism, Christianity, Parsism, Hellenism, Indian concepts), and a final, definitive superstructure of Semitic-Islamic ideas, reconciling all earlier intellectual trends into a cultural synthesis. The stages of a thousand year development thus form simultaneous strata in the intellectual fabric. Since this book is organized according to dis cussions of the different "strata", here we will be concerned only with the Islamic superstructure; the other levels will be treated in later sections. A comprehensive study of Islamic religion, analyzing each stratum, would provide us with a valuable insight into the intellectual evolution of huma nity. This could stimulate questions not yet considered, i.e.: the super imposition of cultural strata, unity of consciousness by assimilation of essentially different systems, variations in attitudes toward the world; and this would finally lead to a psychological re-definition of the race question and of the influence of environment in determining racial charac teristics (for example the evolution of a special Arabic, Persian, or Turkish prototype). To begin with we must determine what is meant in Islam by "theo logian". Every Muslim will defend his faith when treating questions which touch upon it. And philosophical questions most directly concern Islam. Thus every Muslim philosopher is a theologian and an apologist; Averroes and Avicenna, to name two philosophers familiar to the West, bear this fact out. Even an iconoclast such as 'Umar Khayyam occasionally strikes a theological note. He is a mystic. In the narrower sense, which concerns us here, by theologian we mean a writer who attributes primary importance to the consensus of</page><page sequence="2">82 MAX HORTEN the Islamic community and the Qur'?nic precepts, who ascribes the greatest value to these in his thought. The theologian lets foreign ideas - whether Greek, Persian, or Indian - retreat into the background, emphasizing the original "pure" meaning, if possible the literal meaning of the holy texts. Writers who search for the "inner" significance, who appear to disdain the literal interpretation, are not to be included in this group; they are suspected of disregarding the original sense and reading foreign inter pretations into Qur'?nic formulations. On this theological level the first task will be to review the situa tion in general, to survey the interplay of the various schools, to identify the intellectual conflicts and chief problems, to grasp the comprehensive foundation upon which the differentiation of the individual schools takes place. Only thus can we understand the position of these schools in their environment and in the whole process of evolution. The description of a particular school with its individual characteristics and specialities, without a firm understanding of the underlying intellectual principles, could never provide us with a clear insight. Next we should determine the position of theology in the cultural system as a whole, the connections with Greek, Persian, and Indian thought trends, with "philosophy" in the narrow sense - i.e. the Hellenizing school, with physics, mysticism, and popular philosophy. The ties to Christianity are especially close. Out of all these various elements a comprehensive framework is formed, within which the theological movement develops. These influences also produce the intellectual environment, which alone can account for this movement, for the type of spirituality, and for its orien tation to the great religious questions. One objection could be raised: the fact that theology, in this book, is included in the "upper stratum" of philosophy seems to contradict gene ral Oriental thought. Averroes, for example, relegates theology to the in termediate level. This objection is justified when we consider the early period of trial and error, conjecture and random probing. But for later theology (since about 1100) it is not valid; for later theologians demons trate sound and extensive intellectual training. They are examples of a direct continuation of the line of philosophers such as Avicenna. With this in mind and for the sake of clarity, the beginnings of the movement should also be treated as "upper stratum". Unfortunately the following discussions can provide no clear picture of the golden age of this period</page><page sequence="3">THEOLOGIANS IN ISLAM 83 (i.e. 1400 - 1700). Preparatory studies are not available; but it is to be earnestly hoped that later Orientalists will devote themselves to this task. In order to clarify the theological question in Islam it will be helpful to consider the dimensions of theology. As in the Christian Middle Ages, theology in Islam governs the entire field of intellectual life, and the boundaries between theology and philosophy are always blurred, since all philosophers are also theologians. For this reason Avicenna and Averroes attempted to establish and defend Islamic dogma. In a culture completely permeated by religion the situation must be thus; for the great questions concerning man's relation to God and the world coincide in philosophy and religion due to the (partial) identity of their objects. When we divorce these we superimpose a differentiation which in reality is not so distinct. An objective and exact treatment of the subject must, for these reasons, strongly emphasize the essential similarity between Theology and philosophy, as it is a characteristic of the Orient. For the Orient, theology is most sacred, the ideal. Every philosopher wishes to be a theologian, and this motivation is intrinsic. From theology the Oriental intellectual draws a deepening of religious experience and an intensification of moral awareness. For in theology all is supported, motivated and animated by the framework of a great system. We must abandon modern antipathies which stem from an anti-intellectual, anti metaphysical frame of mind and which are primarily directed against the word "theology". For the Orient theology is no "speculative degeneration of higher values" no "cultural decline", but rather the attainment of a great cultural peak, the elevation of a primitive (Bedouin) outlook to a refinement of cultivated thought. Moral action, representing a philosophy rather than a primitive religion, draws new incentives, motives, and direction from these higher spiritual values. So we are dealing with a substantial cultural enrichment. The Oriental, being no anti-intellectual positivist, does not perceive theology as a spirtual aberration; he is a metaphy sician and considers theology an intellectual enrichment and deepening. Another example is that popular catechisms for the lower classes and the moderately educated exhibit a theological tinge, for instance, the San?s?ya and their commentary of B?j?r?. Theologians consider it a noble prin ciple to share with the common people the clear formulations of religious speculation, and the people treasure in these formulations what they believe to be ultimate wisdom. The widespread use of these catechisms is proof of the deep respect commanded by them.</page><page sequence="4">84 MAX HORTEN Relationship to Mysticism Muslim mystics oppose theologians and philosophers, reproaching these two groups for incorporating worldly knowledge into the body of religious thought, thus, claim the mystics, restricting and depreciating the substance of religion and compromising its sanctity. With this censure, however, mystics reveal their own reluctance to adjust any of the intel lectual framework or philosophical elaboration of mysticism; mysticism has produced its own theory (Him, according to Sarr?j) and in this way established a mystical "theology". The Oriental cannot do without a refined intellectual culture. The Oriental ideal of the "universal man" (refinement of all human faculties) and the passionate desire to observe and meditate are apparent in every sphere of Oriental life. Even if we admit to isolated cases in which theology has diminished religious ex perience, intention, and action, we should never regard it as a cultural corrup tion. Theology should be seen as the cultural refinement of the purely emotional and instinctive religious development of the people. It has contri buted much to the clarification and refinement of religious questions, and in this way to the heightening of religious experience and the deepening of personal conscience. Muhammad 'Abduh is one example; a thousand others could be cited. The ideal of high culture prohibits the Oriental, even in the religious sphere, from suppressing any intellectual penetration. Be cause of his exceedingly intellectual outlook, the Oriental requires a theoretical formulation of religious questions, i.e. - a theology. Relationship to Hellenism Islam, as a Semitic religion, had to struggle from its innermost being against the Greek influence, which was characterized by a con templative attitude towards philosophy, perception of the universe ac cording to abstract formulas, and a desire to aesthetically even out any irregularities. In contrast, Islam, true to the mobile character of the Arabic Bedouins, evidenced a decidedly voluntaristic relationship to the world. God is a Supreme Will, choosing and acting in complete freedom. The concept of an eternal creation can be all too easily confused with the idea of a world proceeding necessarily from God; such an idea must then be rejected. God created the world in time by his own free choice, that is, the world did not exist before. Moreover, God acts directly upon each individual creature. He does not avail himself of heavenly spirits</page><page sequence="5">THEOLOGINAS IN ISLAM 85 or of the Nous (Logos) as His agents. Not only the existence, but the essences of things are completely dependent on God (according to orthodox doctrine), and He can arbitarily produce these. Greek thought would perceive these as eternal and intrinsically necessary, therefore immutable. For the Greeks morality is a form of aesthetics in human action. To do evil is unlovely (unaesthetic). The concept of moral responsi bility is, however, incompletely developed. A morality due to the fear of punishment would certainly seem slavish to the Greeks; a morality for love of God, who rewards good, was unknown to them. Here Islam was offered a fresh battlefield, from which, reinforced by Christian in fluences, it emerged victorious. Islam chiefly emphasizes duty. God has given moral commandments and men must dutifully obey them. The correct performance of these is rewarded, disregard for them punished. Good intention and reflection determine the work, without these the "soul" is missing. The first condition of this ethics is free will. One will expect to find the fundamental idea of Islam, perhaps more or less concealed or disguised, in all the various systems. This operates as an organizing,?or at least characterizing,?principle in the flood of opinions, as a leaven which renders foreign systems acceptable to Muslims. If foreign cultures were not thus suffused, they would be spurned by Islam. This basic concept is that of God's personality, i.e. the determination of the highest Being, who appears not as a blind force of nature, but as an intelligence acting according to plan. This idea aligns Islam in the greater sphere of anthropomorphic representations of God. It was conceived by Semites and corresponds to the voluntaristic prototype. This model cannot compete with Greek and Indian concepts in abstraction and philosophical world observation. But in the ethical field it has had a world-wide and reinvigorating impact. It establishes or redefines the characterlistically European moral prototype which can be called the voluntarist; this is the antithesis of moral prototypes which present themselves as aesthetic (in Greece), quietist-contemplative (in India), social (China), emotional, or even primitive. In this battle of mentalities the Islamic principle (fundamentally Christian-Judaic) remained victorious in the Near East. If we consider Islam's position in its struggle with non-Islamic cultures, its pivotal doctrine appears even more starkly emphasized. Islam called for the re-formulation of the Aristotelian-Platonic idea</page><page sequence="6">86 MAX HORTEN of God The concept about which Muslim theologians remcmstrated with Greek-leaning philosophers, the doctrine which occasioned the gap* ing chasm between the two positions, was that of primary Being as the adequate cause of the world, which operates out of inner necessity (that is, mechanically) in the manner of natural causes and effects. The Muslim philosophers (Avicenna, Averroes) answered that they refused to comp rehend such a dependent God in those aestheticizing Greek terms. The God of their world was an unconditionally freely acting Being who imposed moral duties and guided the world according to princi ples of good and justice. In these intellectual encounters the issue was a fresh formulation of doctrine with retention of the old terms; that is, Greek philosophy was to be modified, but its modes of expression were to be scrupulously preserved* so that the great cultural contributions of Greece might not escape Islam. Thus ambiguity of terms results ; and when an effort is made to elucidate these terms, it appears that the opposite parties think basically alike. So an unconscious but fundamental elabo ration of Greek thought is pursued, as its external formulas are incorpora ted. From the older authoritative culture (presumed to possess the highest wisdom) the exterior shell is appropriated, but it is filled with a new spiritual kernel. Thus a Pandora's box of deceptions is opened to his torical research, for the ancient formulas do not always represent be same ideas. The opposition of theologians to the Greek movement was directed against form as well as content. The mise-en-sc?ne of Neo-PIatonic Muslim philosophy was un-Arabic and un-Islamic. The garment was Greek, the terminology partly Greek, partly translated into Arabic, so that the Greek origins could be clearly identified. The Greek names of the phi losophers, sounding barbaric to Arab ears, were particularly offensive when credited as the bearers of ultimate wisdom. Their inclusion insinua ted that paganism was superior to Islam, that Islam followed and was subordinate to heathendom. Ibn Tumlus remarks in his enumeration of Ghaz?lFs writings on Logic, that Ghaz?l? avoided typically Hellenistic designations in the titles of his works and thus eluded the Muslim objec tion to un-Islamic sounding scholarship: "Ghaz?l? changed the titles of books and the labels used for related theories; in this way he evaded the philosophical terms employed by the Greeks and used similar expressions familiar to Muslim jurists and in the common vocabulary of the theologians of his day. He did this out of self-protection and prudence; he wanted</page><page sequence="7">THEOLOGIANS IN ISLAM 87 to avoid the fate of other scholars, who had been exposed to examination and humiliation for introducing extraneous and unfamiliar elements". So the chief impediment was eliminated. The material substance of Greek knowledge could be incorporated, and with the ex ception of a few theses, no objection was now raised. The only pre-con dition was that the formal presentation should conform to Islamic religious sentiment and not flaunt its pagan Greek knowledge as if to lecture to the religion of the Prophet. Later theologians, the mutahaqqiq?n, accom plished this task illustriously. These scholars incorporated the entire body of Greek thought, gave it an Islamic-Arabic face, further elaborated the main problems, and avoided any suggestion of heathen superiority to the Qur'?n. In this way Muslim theologians have become Greek thinkers in Oriental garb. Logic, for the speculative theologians, does not represent a particular branch of knowledge, but rather one of the vehicles of comprehension. Averroes clearly stated that the art of eristic disputation of the theologians was not suited to the discovery of truth;1 their "logic" was the art of finding arguments, an agile debate, in which they sought to catch their opponents unawares. This style did not originate with Aris totle, although topical debate was familiar to him; for these theologians did not know Aristotle. Their style is reminiscent of Indian customs, ac cording to which philosophical systems had to be tested in the fire of great debates. The term kal?m (speech) therefore first had this didactic mean ing,2 that of topical suasion, out-arguing rather than persuading, intricate, confusing discussion {jadal, jid?l, muj?dal?). This pseudo-logic was not organized into a system; however, it confronted the scientific logic of the philosophers, and these undertook the task of replacing the confused thought-process of that ancient theological school, with a rigorous Greek intellectual discipline. If the theologians struggle so passionately against logic (rnantiq), it is partly due to an essentially different intellectual approach. For the older theologians had only one logic (jadal), which was more a debating technique, and Greek demonstration (burh?n) was uncomfortable for them, especially when they approached the field of dogma. Besides, Greek logic seemed to be so intimately linked to Greek theses such as the eternity of the world and the denial of God's freedom, that it was abhorred because of this apparent relationship. In addition, "eternity"</page><page sequence="8">88 MAX HORTEN of the world was falsely assumed to mean that the world was not created, not, as the term was intended, and as it was undertsood by the philosophers, as "creation without beginning". It was claimed that the "logic" of confusion (jadal) of kal?m theology contributed to the depreciation of true logic (mantiq) among the theologians. This is not the case. When the failings of jadal were brought to light (and the philosophers executed this in a thorough manner) the cause of mantiq-logic was not prejudiced, but rather advanced. Discrediting of Logic as mantiq does not follow from disparagement of "theological logic" ; for the two are completely different processes. Avicenna in classical fashion3 demonstrated the principles which are the basis for scholarly proofs; and later literature always returns to these lapidary statements. Ghaz?l?4 refers to these when he proves that the pseudo-syllogism of the old theological school was unscientific; this pseudo-syllogism depended on premises which could be justified only by "universal recognition", that is by a majority vote of the community or in arbitrary implementation by fanatical school leaders, without being in themselves necessary and primary as principia prima and capable of gaining acceptance because of their intrinsic evidence. According to this completely warranted criticism by Ghaz?l?, the y*?t?fa/-"Logic" of the theologians proceeded only from subjective and relatively valid presuppositions and attempted with these to solve the theological and apologetical problem. The reform desired by Ghaz?l? envisaged replacement of these uncertain principles and constructions by those that were scientific and valid; for this reason he introduced Avicenna's logic into theology, although in a different terminology, and thereby assured the treatment of the apologetical question a firm foundation. He achieved for Islam what Saint Thomas had accomplished for Chris tianity; by assimilating Aristotelian logic into the theological method he endowed it with scientific certainty. The struggle of Ghaz?l? and Averroes against the theologians should not be considered hostile to Islam, just as the Thomist movement was not hostile to Christianity. Justified criticism is in these cases the action of a sympathetic, though stern judge. Relationship to Indian "Wisdom" Indian "wisdom" perceives the world and human beings as controlled by powerful forces; these forces are apprehended</page><page sequence="9">THEOLOGIANS IN ISLAM 89 abstractly, one might even say "spacially", (divorced from the concrete and perceptible, therefore beyond the reach of intellect or sense percep tion); they could never be described as personal. Islam, on the other hand conceives of the ultimate "force", the final goal in which Nirvana results, as a personal God, a God who could signify the moral principle and who could determine the world by His will. Islam transforms the abstract idea by comprehending the non-individual and infinite as Ultimate Reality and the Ground of All Being (kaqiqa)?the moral principle of the universe. This Supreme Being establishes laws and directs human life according to precepts of Justice. The theory of cognition is a revealing example of one battlefield where Indian and Islamic ideas clashed. In every era and in every culture the theory of cognition has fluctuated between nominalism and realism, i.e. an emphasis on the inner subjective element and an emphasis on the perceived object. The northern school, that of Baghdad, is sceptical nominalist: things are separate, possessing no common essence which could be perceived or abstracted by thought. The southern school, that of Basra, is realistic: things are homogeneous; they possess essence, which the reason ing mind can grasp. Later these ideas are developed and elaborated as a critical realism somewhere between both extremes. Theologians of the period follow ing Avicenna have through Greek thought come into contact with the critique of extreme realism. Although they do not achieve any decisive theory of cognition, they do manage a certain "restraint" in realistic conceptual thought. The mutabaqqiq?n, the later theologians retain Avicenna's cognition theory. The problem of the relationship of faith to knowledge exhibits the same extremes. The orthodox theological school is the fideistic, anti-rational trend: faith and the great mysteries (for instance the nature of God and resurrection) cannot be understood. The liberal theological school is the rational trend: faith can be completely understood; its doc trines can be reduced to conceptual knowledge. In time these assertions were modified to semi-rationalism: Ash'ar? and M?tur?d? strove to obtain a wide field of permissible activity for reason, but never denied the mys teries of religion. Freedom, the all-pervasive divine causality, the operation of the universe in general - all these are considered inexplicable mys teries. And thus,-until modern times (i.e. B?j?r?), the situation has re mained.</page><page sequence="10">90 MAX HORTEN Relationship to Christian Ideas Islam's characteristic relationship to its spiritual surroundings is especially clear in its connection to Christianity. This can be observed in general in the theology and in particular in the question of predestina tion (where the most contrasting elements come together). Originally Islam advocated both theological determinism and accountability for action; for there are Qur'?nic texts which presuppose man's independence of action, and others which presume that all human activity is determined by God. In the earliest period no attempt was made to resolve these contradictions; there was no awareness of the conflict. The origin of religion comes about from an impulsive act of will, when reflection is suppressed. Purely practical and pressing tasks, the urgency of outside activity and of religious emotional expression, as in every ease of extreme voluntarism, preclude reflection. Islam developed a more refined religious formulation where reason played its role only later, during more peaceful times; by then Christianity had operated upon Islam from its primogenial Greek-intellectualized niveau. This refined form of a religion ennobled by reason condensed into theology. This can be seen as the attempt to harmonize the intuitive religion of the Prophet and the community with the demands of philosophical minds to harmonize this religion with modern science, and to raise it to a position of respect in intellectual civilization. More accurately this can be considered an attempt to adjust intellectual civilization to religious beliefs. Islamic theology is, obviously, no independent science. The Qur'?nic precepts are a binding pre-condition. Yet this theology must be respected as an effort to introduce the religion of the Prophet into the native intellectual cultur e of the epoch, to provide Islam with philosophical armament. All this was facil itated by the living example and direct influence of Christianity (i.e. educated Christians in the vicinity). Christian theology in the Orient stressed, first of all, human free dom and the individual's full responsibility for his acts. The arguments in favor of this were so convincing that the open-minded Muslim, re ceptive to more advanced ideas, felt compelled to accept them. Thus resulted the concept of freedom in the liberal theological movement irr Islam. The extreme formulations presented by this school proved how incapable it was of doing justice to all the dimensions of this problem. God does not "create" human deeds, since he could never produce an evil' action (even in its positive aspects). Man, however, is creator of his own actions; with these he brings new realities into existence. Efe: create*</page><page sequence="11">THEOLOGIANS IN ISLAM 91 something ont of nothing. The orthodox theologians found no difficulties in opposing these ideas. They characterized the liberals as polytheists or dualists ("Magi of Islam*'), in that they admitted, besides God, the existence of other creators, that is of individual human beings who "create" their actions. The liberals objected: you (the orthodoxy) portray an unjust God who punishes in men actions which He himself ordains, making of man an involuntary instrument in His hands. The "solution" proposed by Ash'arl (d. 935) proved the insolu bility of the problem. According to Ash'ar? human action is entirely the creation of God. Man, however, is capable of accepting his actions. The objection was raised: this acceptance cannot be a purely passive atti tude, or there would be no basis for freedom and responsibility. There must be an activity, by which the individual can voluntarily decide to re ceive the action sent by God. Thus acceptance becomes a human action that must first be created by God, as every nascent thing is produced by Him. Thus results a drculus or a regressus in infinitum. Finally, since tthe difficulties could not be ignored, the liberals reconciled themselves to recognizing predestination without denying freedom. The problem remained open and unresolved. A survey of the related schools completes the picture. Another interpretation was that of the practical mystics who stood for freedom of will (vindicating the value of their asceticism), yet remained aloof from any discussion. Another point of view was that of the spe culative mystics (p/i), who for the most part represented ideas of pantheism and Nirvana: the sum of reality is one unique substance of being, which differentiating itself by inner necessity, becomes the world of plurality and multiplicity. Thus man is a differentiated form of the Godhead. In death these individualizing principles disappear and man is absorbed once again into undetermined non-individualized Being, the Godhead. According to this doctrine, freedom is unconditionally excluded. In this battle of the schools the hard core of Islamic theology had al ways defended freedom of will against all attacks, even those of its own camp. The school which "denied freedom of will" (Jabariya; jabar-coactio) endured only, in the earlier period, and even then it could not resist the compelling (although often narrowly formulated) arguments of the liberal movement. From these conflicts a moderate line resulted (Ash'ari, M?tur?d?) and its authority has not been successfully challenged until now.</page><page sequence="12">92 MAX HORTEN The Greek-oriented philosophers by no means disavow the empirical fact of freedom of conscience. They do not consider this abrogated by their doctrine of the chain of adequate causes (F?r?b?, Avicenna) or by their concept of the agent operating per se as the "cause" of each species existing per accidens (Averroes); whereas the theologians do concede abrogation of human freedom by God's omnipotence "apart from whom no other operating force exists in the universe". We find a stark denial of freedom in astrological concepts and folk beliefs; these two trains of thought, often articulated in proverbs, express the idea that the "heavens" direct all earthly events. From these discussions it is obvious that the inability to solve the problem of freedom resulted from the failure to formulate a metaphysical system. Later theological developments attempt to corect this error. The question is posed; what can be the relationship of two causes to one result? The second cause must be subordinate to the first; in that case the entire result can be attributed to each one of them. Man is responsible for his own actions, and God is responsible for man's action, and both belong to separate spheres of activity. In this way the contrast between God and man, which was taken for granted in the older theological school, is mitigated, one could even say, neutralized. With no qualms the theo logian acknowledges that God is the cause of all man's actions, that man wills thi* action voluntarily and thus is also its "cause". This solution, current in later theological schools of thought, would be inconceivable if the two causes were operating on the same level of reality. The rigid attitude of theologians concerning the eternity of the world is certainly due to their failure to fathom the metaphysical concepts. For these the ologians identify eternity with self-existence (the state of being not-created), in other words, the Godhead. God alone is eternal, there fore everything eternal is God. Nonetheless philosophers never tire of explaining how a creature of God can attain eternity, i.e. that eternity does not contradict the quality of "being created". In this problem-complex a train of thought akin to Christian theology can be detected. And the intellectual roots must be traced back to Greek philosophy. Relationship to Parsism and Astral Conceptions; Muhammad-Logos 1 our earliest period of Oriental Studies scholars devoted themselves to explaining the life of Muhammad - with great ingenuity and ac claimed success; yet we now realize that of this life we can know almost</page><page sequence="13">THEOLOGIANS IN ISLAM 93 nothing with certainty.5 It has also become evident that the actual, that is the concrete physical and mental life of the Prophet has no real bearing on the religion he established; for the religion exists without insight into his life. The theoretical-mythological, let us say (in the Muslim sense) the metaphysical personality of Muhammad, his religious essence, is fun damental to this religion. From the example of Muhammad the individual Muslim abstracts the models for his world-view, his ethics, his religious preparation for life, the entire range of his emotional religious response. In Muhammad the faithful find their religion concentrated as a mirror image and as a projection. For the common man6 as well as for the educated class, Muhammad represents light, light which flows directly from God, light from which the world is fashioned. The essence of God, of Muhammad, and of the world, is, in this sense, one. Yet this reality contains within it different levels (and in this interpretation disagrees with monist pantheism). In God reality is "self-existent", in Muhammad an "emanation", in the world "created". Occasionally the process of divine irradiation is also called "creation" when referring to the light of Muhammad. In fact the process is determined and therefore to be characterized as emanation. Ignoring the conventions of the orthodoxy, who insist on the definition of "creation", the liberal theological schools portray Muhammad's com ing as an emanation from God, a conformation from the very light of God. Muhammad is the Logos (in its essential features to be identified with the idea of the Son of God in the ancient Orient). Muhammad's ascent into heaven is thus represented: he is mounted upon bur?q ("the mighty flash"), his horse, who has a human face (sign of his otherworldly nature) and wears a crown on his head (image of the sun's halo); he carries a peacock's plume (peacock=bird of the sun; tail=rays) and is often encircled by glowing flames as he journeys over the clouds. After passing through the seven heavens (the seven levels of the planetary system), he crosses the light-oceans and reaches the lotus tree, where God is enthroned. From God he receives religious re velations, and with this divine message he descends once again to earth. The organization of the visible polity of Islam on earth has been copied from heavenly models. In heaven are to be found the archetypes and original standards, which, applied to earthly life, will provide right guidance (huda), the broad street (sharVa), the common way. Earth is thus a reflec tion of heaven.</page><page sequence="14">94 MAX HORTEN No deictic (that which can be pointed to as an example) object corresponds to these representations, or to those concerning spirits, angels, and God. However, examination of the psychological components pro vides an insight ; from the angle of the perceiving subject the mass of images, and from the angle of the object an (inadequate) field which serves as framework and carrier of these ideas. In our icase we can identify two groups: a light-philosophy and a sun-philosophy. The light-philosophy apprehends light as the primary experience of primitive man, endows this with personality through mystical intution, and elaborates the idea of the great earth hero who must also be of a luminous nature, justas the great heaven-hero is light. In the ancient Orient the concept of earth thus corresponds to the concept of heaven. The other group of images is taken from sun-philosophy. Here the sun is experienced as the essential substance of nature, ?s similarly (through projection and perception) endowed with personality, and portrayed as the great hero of the celestial kingdoms. This hero figure enacts a heavenly ascent (theme of the sun's progress from March 21 to June 21). His horse also exhibits sun-motifs (white coat, flowing mane and tail, Simson^image). The heavenly hero approaches the supreme Godhead (representated by primitive man as dwelling above the tropic particularly at the North Pole). The sunrise theme is developed fancifully in reference to Muhammad's ascent to heaven: Muhammad travels through the "light oceans" above the tropic to the North Pole (the "lotus tree at the ultimate point") and beyond. There he speaks with God, and afterwards he des cends again to the lower worlds, where he delivers revelations received from the ultimate sources of wisdom. The image of the sun-hero is very familiar to Orientals, living as they do in the out of doors under usually cloudless skies. And the trans ference of qualities of heavenly heroes to earthly heroes seems so natural, that the above-mentioned motifs are applied almost unconsciously to Muhammad (and to other outstanding "saints" and mystics, i.e. Junayd ? "peacock":bird of the sun; H?jim Sultan). Even highly intellectual circles (philosophers, theologians, moral philosophers) are guided by these ideas in arriving at their "scientific" convictions. Here we can observe to what extent environment, habit, and folk-culture influence the highest spheres of learning. This panoply of sun-images permits us a glimpse into a long succession t&gt;f world-view phases reaching back into primitive times. T?ken as a Whole these belong to the history of "philo</page><page sequence="15">THEOLOGIANS^ IN ISLAM 95&lt; sophy". Even tfae^ steed of the Prophet is a cosmic-metaphysical figure and should not be overlooked. If these cosmic astral themes really, are an important element in the world*view of the folk-consciousness, and it is quite obvious that they are, then the Muslim community will natu rally portray its hero Muhammad according to these themes. We would expect the orthodox picture of the Prophet to be presented just as it* actually is in the popular biographies.7 Astrology is a pre-Islamic stage of religion; it precludes the direct intervention of God in earthly proceedings and denies His free will in the guidance of the universe. Soothsayers predicted events from the stars and magicians worked miracles by harnessing the power of the heavens in amulets, ceremonies, and other energy-transferences (in the same manner as shamans). Islam tried to suppress this religion of magic and replace it with monotheism. The astrological beliefs had to be eliminated, on since that was impossible, at least "corrected", i.e. redefined in an Islamic sense and incorporated into Qur'?nic dogma. A Neo-Platonist such as Avicenna could accomplish this since, in his philosophy, the planetary spirits are subordinate to God (moreover, Avicenna contests the appli cability of astrology). Philosophical dilettantes, the brethren off Basra8 were also successful in this regard. "The realization of divine destinies is synonomous with the inevitable influence of the stars, and the decrees of God are synonomous with His foreknowledge of this heavenly influence". SijazT (about 1000) wrote a book about "rules which the astrologer must apply, in order to deduce God's decrees from the stars". Liberal theologians were sometimes inconsistent. Jubb?'?9 be lieved in the influence of the stars ; yet a later work of his appears to refute unauthorized astrology. His contemporary, Nawbakhti rejected this statement as^ too restrained. In general the theologians considered an easily attainable harmonization; such as the Greek movement had accom plished, as too dangerous for pure faith. There may have been a reasonable assessment of the essential differences of these two systems, ?nly thinly disguised in this superficial reconciliation. The liberals fBarda'?) as well as the orthodoxy ultimately decided on unqualified rejection. Ash'ar? disputes that "temporal events of the sublunary world? and men's fates can be deduced from the stars".10 After the doctrine of acquisition and God's unique activity in the world1 (Occasionalism) had been formulated,, no other theory was really possible in this school. Many theologians defended their personal free</page><page sequence="16">96 MAX HORTEN dorn (in spite of their master Ash'ar?, who represented authoritative opinion), and taught as R?z?,11 that astrology should be acknowledged, but that Prophetic tradition should be considered the sole source of "know ledge of the heavens". In this way folk-sentiment, which calls for accep tance of astrology, was appeased. Even B?jur?, in his commentary on the Burda of al-B?sM, had to comply with this inclination. An extremely hostile attitude would have branded belief in magic, which is powerful even today in Islam and representative of an entire cultural stratum, as out side the bounds of the religion of the Prophet. This would have been a religious and political impossiblity. For this reason conciliatory theo logians take a position of compromise; they proclaim astrology and magic acceptable when practiced in God's name, and when according to the example of the philosophers, the forces are regarded as dependent on God's omnipotence. The process described here is an example of how cultural strata are superimposed, how different trends converge, and how extreme differ ences are reconciled. Life in a particular culture is guided by the confi gurations and movements resulting from these primarily psychological trends. Other Characteristics of Islamic Theology Universal laws and basic definitions of reality, established ac cording to such an unrefined, incompletely explained metaphysics, were necessarily part fantasy, part speculation. These show us latent or emerging ideas, and vaguely suggest the abstract content, without pro viding any clear formulation. The images portraying God's guidance of the world were based on vivid pictorial representations drawn from the folk-culture. In the ancient Orient these had already merged into a world-view. The rising and setting of the stars and planets, life and activity in the world of nature, growth and decay of plants and animals? all this occurs in the service of God, in praise of the Most High. The angels join in this service and praise the Lord by performing the holy circum ambulation around the heavenly Ka'ba (as planet-angels upon the zodiac around the North-Pole, God's original abode?link between Islam and pre-Islamic, astral world-views). Men also participate in this divine activity, following Islamic cult precepts of pilgrimage, etc. Thus we can compre hend how this fundamental concept determines individual and social life, further art and science. The mentality and life-style of the Oriental</page><page sequence="17">THEOLOGINAS IN ISLAM 97 exhibit a certain dignity, solemnity, and force; for the world is perceived as God's act, a manifestation of primary Being. The most insignificant thing thus partakes of the absolute and eternal and rises above the mean ingless futility of finite existence. In order to understand the position held by the Qur'?n in Oriental thought and in the movements of the different schools, we must first admit that a religion without a holy scripture is inconceivable. God inscribes the destinies of the world in His heavenly book, upon the "well preserved tablet", the "book of fate". And, as the universe cannot be conceivably directed without a book, so men also require a book to guide them; the founders of religious movements such as Ibn T mart, B?b and Bah?, were therefore especially eager to write a book?a scripture to become the book, the Bible for their followers. (Bah? even called his books "tablets", to incorporate the theme of God's tablet of destiny). The Holy Book should, therefore, not be tampered with in any way, for the entire religious structure rests upon this as its foundation. It alone is the legitimate, the actual and theoretical vehicle of God's expressed will. Considering these fundamental philosophical assumptions, it is no wonder that the great majority of the faithful hold to the literal interpreta tion of the "Book". Different approaches to Qur'?nic texts therefore distinguish the liberal and conservative theologians. In the Qur'?n there are graphic anthropomorphic passages which speak of God's hand or eye. Until B?qill?nl (d. 1012) the conservatives had refused to reinterpret these texts. B?qill?nl labeled those who gave a fresh interpretation "unbelievers" (ikf?r al-muta'awwilin12.) The situation remained thus until R?z? (d. 1209), who, with his more solid philosophical background, was able to finally put aside the scruples against justifying a "re-interpretation". The liberals were already centuries ahead. From the beginning they had justified the interpretation, according to the demands of reason, of difficult Qur'?nic texts (admitting that, obviously, an imperfect creature was thus made arbiter of the revealed word). One is often surprised, that Islam has tolerated a strong pantheistic movement, and that this movement has even considered itself genuinely Islamic. The deeper reason for this can be found in the manner of ex periencing the world, which perceives the work of God, His order and omniscience, in the greatest and most insignificant phenomena and pro</page><page sequence="18">98 MAX HORTEN cesses. God is "not far" from each Muslim. He works and rules in each. From this all-embracing activity of God in the world, down to the tiniest atom one must admittedly bridge a gaping chasm to arrive at the union of God and world in a conceptual formulation; but in the sentiment, which is the foundation of both images, there exists an intimate relationship. The Islamic consciousness of living in God (hud?r), always surrounded by His love and mercy, overflows into the mystic experience of "being one with God" (tawfrid), disappearing in God, taking on divine characteristics (takhalluq) and being absorbed in God (fand). In this emotional kin ship, with its roots in the most profound experience of life's mystery, can be found the reason for Islam's tolerance of pantheistic and visionary mysticism, especially when this mysticism retains unmolested the formulas and forms of the Qur'?n and the Muslim community. Each people entrusts to its sacred texts the highest ideals. The wording may be banally sober; but this does not detract from the spiritual, emotional, and inspirational qualities. Therefore each period, each movement of Islam has read into the Qur'?n the ideals of the present age, race, social group, and individual personality, so that commentaries on the Qur'?n are the clearest reflections of the intellectual life of the age. These are characterized by a striving towards complete harmony, as if by ascending stages of perfection. Long rows of creatures from the lowest devils to God Supreme dance before our eyes. This is not a stagnant harmony, but one of constant movement. The themes of rising and descend ing (taken from the sun's course, therefore signifying the common Oriental belief in ascent and descent of the soul; compare Gnosis and Plotin) and of rotation and succession, the concepts of the heavenly scales of per fection, upon which in eternity Muhammad is constantly rising to greater glories, and of God's all-animating power and grace, lend intensity to the images and rhythm and thrust to the idea of universal harmony. And all these intuitions and visions appear not as individual or national con tributions, but, since they have been taken from the Qur'?n, as revelations of primeval wisdom of the Omniscient, who has foreseen these since all eternity in His world-plan and revealed them through Muhammad for the passing ages. This supreme authority shall have the power - thus the task is envisaged?to strengthen and support moral efforts. It is obvious that philosophy, projected into this hallowed atmosphere, and permeated by this awe of the sublime, must become an apology for Islam. A religion is largely determined by its assessment of reality; for</page><page sequence="19">THEOLOGIANS IN ISLAM 99 this valuation reveals the forces and ideals which are the very life of the religion. Islam considers life in the Here-and-Now decidedly inferior to life in the Hereafter. This was the verdict of early Islam, which antici pated the imminent end of the world. This was also the judgement of later Islam, which, coming under stronger Christian influences, more distinctly elaborated its basic concepts: concentration of the spirit on God and the Hereafter, curbing of the impulses towards sensuality and worldly preoccupation. (Although in the very sayings of the Prophet and in the worldly drives of the rulers and the rich robust worldly enjoyment becomes apparent). The high estimation of asceticism in Islamic monastic life is an intensification of the "otherworldly trend" which helped determine the Islamic character. Thus in Islam we find no tensions and discords straining to the breaking point, but only emphasis in differing degrees on the same basic tendencies. We find no extreme polarity between spirit and ex ternal form, interior and exterior life. All these counter-currents strive towards harmonization. Theology becomes reconciled with mysticism; ethics (Ghaz?l?) modifies formalistic Islamic law. The democratic Arab disposition recognizes the validity of each school. In this spiritual en vironment, philosophy, in its comprehension of the world, moves in the same orbit as Islam, and must, according to the precepts of psychology, strive to harmonize contrasting elements and combine the component forces in a cultural synthesis. The ideal of encyclopedic structure and of the complete man resolves this goal (appearing in apologetic forms) to achieve cultural unity. To determine the convergence of the main cultural tendencies, it is of fundamental importance to observe the reciprocal exchanges and mutual influences of the various schools. In such cases links between the various groups are forged and extreme positions modified. Of course the inner conflict and cultural discord are still superficially apparent; but suggested points of contact intimate a deeper unity. Convictions of one group can influence the others; proofs and evidences from one group can win over reasoning and unprejudiced minds. There are many examples of this: around 1150 the Ash'arite school embraced strikingly liberal ideas such as the allegorical re-interpretation of Qur'?nic texts with anthropomorphic content?to the great outrage of the ultra-conservatives. The liberal-thinking R?z? (d. 1210), a pillar of conservatism, was reported to have been poisoned by Karmathians. These clung to the anthropomorphic depictions of God because of the clear</page><page sequence="20">100 MAX HORTEN evidence of Qur'?nic texts. Each liberalizing conservative was an abomina tion for them and his life condemned as that of an apostate.13 Ash'ar? already represented a compomise for his age, but the later Ash'arite school moved more to the left. B?qill?n? and Ibn F?rak14 (who, in spite of his recantation before Mahmud, was poisoned at the instigation of his conservative rivals) and even Juwayn? assimilated more liberal views. Ab? 1-Waf? (d. 1119), an especially striking and contra dictory example, came from the Hanbalites, ultra-conservatives, to the liberals, and even established contact with the liberal mystics, pronouncing over the pantheist Hall?j the benediction: "May God have mercy on him". Thus he refused to consider this mystic a heretic. Furthermore, he re cognized the justification for the allegorical re-interpretation of anthro pomorphic Qur'?nic passages, and he paid homage to the nominalism of the liberal Baghdad school in his precept: "The darkness is no in dependent (positive) principle of being and no contrarium of light. It is the negation of light, its contradictorium". The thesis of phenomenal diversity is thereby conceded.15 NOTES 1. M?ller : A verwes 57,18 ; Averroes : Tah?fut 91-2 etc. 2. Qifti 16, 8. 3.

On the frontispiece we see Muhammad riding through the heavenly domains inhabited by the Blessed. The H?ris approach from all sides with offerings of food. But there to the left, in the direcci?n in which Muhammad is riding, we see the angel Gabriel beckoning onwards; for Muhammad has not yet reached God. First the world of the light-veils and light-oceans must be conquered, light-motifs are in abundance here; blazing flames dart out in all directions; Muhammad's face is such a dazzling white that it has become indistinct; his steed, Bur?q, wears the sunsign of the diadem: the tail seems to be formed of light rays and peacock feathers. The lower half of the picture is dark, the upper part light; for the upper regions are the domains of the pure light worlds.
