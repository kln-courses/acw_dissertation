<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> C H A P T E R  9 Fracturing Forms:  Recuperation and Simulation  in The Golden Notebook r i t i c i s m  on The Golden Notebook  has largely been concerned  C to understand it as a work of literature, removed from its social  context. Yet The Golden Notebook  is deeply concerned with the  relation between cultural formation, artistic expression, and individ- ual identity. It foregrounds many of the concepts that are central  to the new scientific paradigms— chaos and information, unpre- dictability and fragmentation— identifying them as crucial to the  evolution of new forms of literature and subjectivity. Although  Doris Lessing almost certainly did not know about chaos theory, she  was keenly aware of the impact that proliferating information was  having on traditional art forms. She also realized that these changes  were bound up with the problematic relation of local sites to global  perspectives. The Golden Notebook  thus represents a development  parallel to chaos theory. It testifies to how highly charged the idea of  chaos had become by the mid—twentieth century. The Golden Notebook  (1962) represents a cusp in Doris Lessing’s  works, a transitional moment in which chaos is breaking open old  forms but before it has catalyzed the emergence of “a new way of  looking at life.” And yet the fractured form points to the creation of  something new— although whether this something is a novel re- mains problematic. Why a new form should be necessary is inti- mated by Anna as she writes about her dissatisfaction with her novel 236 </page> <page sequence="2"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 237 The Frontiers o f  War. “The novel has become a function of the frag- mented society, the fragmented consciousness. Human beings are so  divided, are becoming more and more divided, and more subdivided  in themselves, reflecting the world, that they reach out desperately,  not knowing they do it, for information about other groups inside  their own country, let alone about groups in other countries” (p.  61). To trace the connections between fragmentation and the  changed novelistic function that Anna senses, it will be helpful to  recall the distinction Walter Benjamin makes between the story, the  novel, and information (1969:83—n o ) . 1 According to Benjamin, the story had its beginnings in craft labor.  He conjures up an image of a storyteller spinning his tale while his  listeners spin and weave cloth, with the rhythm of the story and the  rhythm of the work interpenetrating. The purpose of the story is to  give counsel, Benjamin says, which presupposes a physical commu- nity that speaker and listener cohabit, and more profoundly a com- munity of values they share. The novel is distinguished from the  story in being written. Following Lukâcs, Benjamin sees the novel as  signifying a “transcendental homelessness” (p. 99), an essential iso- lation reflected in its attempt to grasp the meaning of life. Since this  meaning can be apparent only in retrospect, after the whole shape of  a life is known, the novel positions itself ontologically as a re- membrance. The story, by contrast, addresses itself to how the lis- tener can enrich his life as he lives it. Rather than try to grasp the  whole, it contributes to the ongoingness of process. The decay of community implicit in the contrast between story  and novel progresses further with information. Unlike either story or  novel, information has no depth, no spaces where the listener or  reader may enter to supply her own interpretation. On the contrary,  Benjamin says, the primary requirement for information is that it be  “ ‘understandable in i tse lf” (p. 89), fully explained and immediately  accessible. Whereas story presupposes a shared context and commu- 'I am indebted to Alan Swingewood for drawing the connection between Ben- jamin’s theory and Lessing in his article “Structure and Ideology in the Novels of  Doris Lessing” Sociology Review Monograph: The Sociology o f  Literature 26  (1978): 3 8 -5 4 .  Swingewood also notes that the emergence of a novel of information  is connected with the disappearance of the “problematic hero” in Lessing’s fiction  and with her replacement by a “collective hero and conceptual structure” ( p. 41). </page> <page sequence="3"> 23 8 The Figure in the Carpet nal values, information can be transported into any context. The  incongruous juxtapositions of newspaper fillers illustrate the disap- pearance of shared, stable contexts: how many camels were born  last year in Saudi Arabia, how many months an elephant carries its  young before parturition. What connection does this information  have to the reader, and what contexts does it presuppose and create?  According to Benjamin, the triumph of information over story and  novel bespeaks the death of experience, for to him experience means  something more than facts or explanations. It signifies the texture of  life created from a wealth of small shared moments, the unspoken  and unconscious expectations that form the fabric upon which the  figures of story are embroidered. In the absence of these shared con- texts, experience is incommunicable. Facts can be told; events can be  narrated; but experience cannot be shared, for the cloth out of  which it is woven has been destroyed. The Golden Notebook  records the end of story through Anna’s  failure to tell a story, linking it to a fragmentation so profound that  even the remembrance of experience is lost. Throughout, Anna  senses that words are losing their meaning; “the gap between what  they are supposed to mean, and what they in fact say seems unbridg-  able” (p. 300). The retrospective shape of the novel haunts her as  she tries to write about the breakup of her five-year relationship  with her married lover, Michael, using the characters Ella and Paul.  Musing on how the ending of the affair distorts the telling of it,  Anna writes that the “trouble with this story is that it is written in  terms of analysis of the laws of dissolution of the relationship be- tween Paul and Ella. I don’t see any other way to write it. As soon as  one has lived through something, it falls into a pattern. And the  pattern . . .  is untrue. Because while living through something one  doesn’t think like that at all.” Anna wonders if she should try to tell  her story by recording every detail of two days, one near the begin- ning and another near the end, to convey the sense of process. But  she realizes that “I would still be instinctively isolating and empha- sizing the factors that destroyed the affair. It is that which would  give the thing its shape. Otherwise it would be chaos. . . . Literature  is analysis after the event” (pp. 227—228). Dismayed by “the thinning of language against the density of our  experience” (p. 302), Anna turns to visual media as truer modes of </page> <page sequence="4"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 23p expression, imagining the stories she tells as films rather than novels  or stories. But even films desert her when she dreams that The Fron- tiers o f  War has finally been made into a movie. She complains to  the director that the film has falsified her experiences. More than  that, it has displaced them, for after seeing the film she finds that she  can no longer remember how Maryrose held her head or Paul smiled  (pp. 524—525). Later, the film moves inward and an imagined “pro- jectionist” screens it within her mind. Thinking how wrong it is,  Anna is devastated when she reads the credits and finds that she is  the director. The problem thus goes deeper than language, deeper  even than sensory perception. At its root is a fragmentation of the  social context reflected in the four notebooks Anna keeps— black  for her memories of her African experiences, red for her encounters  with the British Communist Party, yellow for the stories she makes  from her experiences, blue for her record of the experiences them- selves. The “Free W omen” sections do not, as they may at first seem  to do, succeed in creating a metacontext into which all the other  contexts may fit. Rather, they represent yet another partial con- text— the traditional realistic novel that is no longer able to contain  or express all of the fractured sites of Anna’s consciousness. Increas- ingly Anna feels that she cannot capture the truth of her experiences  in any of these modes. The failure of the film confirms that the gap  between reality and representation is unbridgeable, for it implies  that the person she was cannot communicate with the person she is,  so that her experience is incommunicable even to herself. Under this pressure, the function of the novel necessarily changes.  If the experiences that constitute one’s past cannot be shared even  with oneself, there can be no question of representing through re- membrance the shape of a life.2 Within The Golden Notebook , a  novel of sorts still exists in the “Free W omen” sections, but it is  punctuated by the notebook entries. Within the notebooks, novelis-  tic fragments also exist. But as the narrative continues, stories in- creasingly give way to information. The black notebook ends as a 2Patrocinio P. Schweickart, in “Reading a Wordless Statement: The Structure of  Doris Lessing’s The Golden N otebook , ” Modern Fiction Studies 31 (1985): 263—  279, also notices the problematic nature of the novels within the novel, calling The  Golden N otebook  “a collection of canceled novels, novels Lessing had refused to  write but nevertheless had written” (p. 274). </page> <page sequence="5"> 140 The Figure in the Carpet collage of newspaper clippings. A similar fate befalls the red note- book. The yellow notebook fragments into pieces of stories spliced  together into a pastiche. The blue notebook, which Anna dedicates  to writing about events as they happen without making up stories  about them, continues to record information from her fragmenting  sensibility after the other notebooks have stopped. It too ends; yet  its final page marks a turning. Having drawn heavy black lines  across the pages of the other notebooks, Anna resolves to write no  longer in separate texts, but to put “all of myself in one book” (p.  607). This will toward synthesis drives her into a direct confrontation  with the information age. She cuts out newspaper articles about hor- rific events all over the world— rapes, tortures, murders, genocide—  and for as high as she can reach, papers the walls of her room with  them. She spends her days going about the room, reading clippings  and putting up more. By physically locating this disparate informa- tion within her living space and by absorbing it within herself, she  succeeds in creating a common context for it. The price she pays is  that she must now live in the space she has created. She is the com- mon denominator for the information she scans; if her attention  wanders or if she leaves the room, it degenerates again into frag- ments. “It was as if she, Anna, were a central point of awareness,  being attacked by a million unco-ordinated facts, and the central  point would disappear if she proved unable to weigh and balance  the facts, take them all into account” (p. 649). Tortured by the in- formation on her walls but unable to break free from her feeling that  she must bring it together into a whole, Anna contemplates begin- ning to paper a second room with clippings. By extension, one could  imagine a world in which the Derridean maxim that there is no out- side to the text would be literally true. From her doubly interior  position within the text/room, Anna realizes that her quest for  wholeness (which is also Lessing’s quest for a novel about Anna) has  led her into chaos. She is surrounded by it; more than that, she has  become it. As an emblem, the text/room reveals that the attempt to see things  whole entails recognition that the individual psyche is bound to the  culture by feedback loops that run through textuality. The texts pro- duced by the culture and by the individual, produce them in turn. If </page> <page sequence="6"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 241 the texts of a culture are profoundly fragmented and obsessed with  death, so is the text that is the individual. And if one wants to grasp  the whole, as in a traditional novel, one must write about fragmen- tation and chaos, which is to say, one must write information and  not a novel. This is the paradox at the center of The Golden Note- book, whose fractured form signifies that it is a novel under erasure,  attempting to represent the shape of the whole by meditating upon  all the complex reasons why wholeness is impossible at this time. The Limits o f  Analogy: O n the Cusp In Lessing’s 1971 Introduction to The Golden Notebook , she  complains that the central importance of the novel’s structure had  been overlooked, asserting that it constitutes a “wordless statement”  designed “to talk through the way it was shaped” (p. xiv). Since  Lessing’s Introduction, a number of essays have appeared emphasiz- ing the significance of the structure and exploring its relation to the  novel’s central themes.3 Several years ago Betsy Draine pointed out  that Lessing’s text, despite its concern with disorder, is highly sym- metric (1980:32). Draine represented the order as follows (from left  to right).4 ’Barbara Bellow Watson, “Leaving the Safety of Myth: Doris Lessing’s The  Golden N o t e b o o k in O ld  Lines, N ew  Forces, ed. Robert K. Morris, pp. 1 2 -3 7   (New York: Rutherford, 1976), comments on the tension between order and chaos  in the structure, asserting that “nothing could be more orderly, nothing could be  more a response to chaos” (p. 16). Herbert Marder, in “The Paradox of Form in The  Golden N otebook ,” Modern Fiction Studies 26 (1980): 4 9 -5 4 ,  interprets the para- dox of a formed formlessness as an embodiment of the mystical insights Anna has in  “The Golden N otebook” and “Free Women 5 .” Anne M. Mulkeen, in “Twentieth-  Century Realism: The ‘Grid’ Structure of The Golden N o te b o o k S tu d i e s  in the  N ovel 4 (1972): 2 6 1 -2 7 4 , interprets the structure spatially, as a “crisscrossing of a  multiplicity of viewpoints with a multiplicity of events and issues, near and far,  through a series of stages in time” (p. 262). Schweickart, in “Reading a Wordless  Statement,” stresses the “articulated” nature of the structure, in the sense that it is  “cracked, broken in pieces, and, at the same time, hinged, held together by folding-  joints” (p. 268). Betsy Draine gives a subtle and complex reading of the form as  typical of postmodernism. Draine sees the fractured form as a response to the “dy- namic interplay of order and chaos” (1980:31), and she charts this interplay through  the tension between nostalgia and irony within the narrative. 4The structure is actually more complex than this scheme recognizes, but this nota- tion is useful for the moment. Later I will refine and modify it. </page> <page sequence="7"> 242 The Figure in the Carpet Free Black Red Yellow Blue Women 1 Notebook Notebook Notebook Notebook 1 1 1 1 Free Black Red Yellow Blue Women 2 Notebook Notebook Notebook Notebook 2 2 2 2 Free Black Red Yellow Blue Women 3 Notebook Notebook Notebook Notebook 3 3 3 3 Free Black Red Yellow Blue Women 4 Notebook Notebook Notebook Notebook 4 4 4 4 The Golden Notebook  Free Women 5 It is immediately obvious that the structure is recursive, cycling  through each of the “Free Women” sections and four notebooks in  turn, until the symmetry is broken with the part named after the  whole, “The Golden Notebook.” Just as there are four notebooks,  so there are four recursions before this bifurcation is reached. Given  these symmetries, it is tempting to think of the structure as bringing  order out of chaos. Such a reading would argue that The Golden  Notebook functions like a self-organizing system, with the onset of  chaos precipitating a reorganization of the text at a higher level of  complexity. In my view this reading ought to be resisted. The analogy with  chaos theory is compelling. It is also subtly misleading if it leads us  to read The Golden Notebook  retrospectively. From a retrospective  view, with knowledge of the paths that were in fact taken in the  development of chaotics, earlier works that embody some but not all  of its features are seen as imperfect avatars pointing toward later  developments, as though there were some inevitable and necessary  progressions these events must follow. For writers struggling to con- ceptualize new ideas before they crystallized into paradigms, how- ever, it would not be clear that the situation consisted of develop- ments, that these developments could be placed along a line, or that  this line was a path pointing in a new direction. As a text located at  or near a transformation in paradigms, The Golden Notebook  al- most certainly contains possibilities that would be suppressed if it </page> <page sequence="8"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 243 were fixed through coordinates that became points of reference only  after it was written. In juxtaposing The Golden Notebook  with chaos theory, then, I  do not intend to argue that it embodies a recursive structure in the  same sense chaos models do. One of the major contributions of  chaos theory has been to provide a set of ideas that people can use  to think with when they confront the apparent paradox that chaos  makes order possible. Lessing did not have access to these ideas  when she wrote The Golden Notebook. Consequently, the problems  involved in wresting order from chaos seem to her more intractable  and less susceptible to rational analysis than they would to someone  whose thought has been formed by chaos theory. The recursive  structure of The Golden Notebook  does share certain general char- acteristics with chaos models, including the tendency to magnify la- tent instabilities and to constitute the relation between local sites  and global perspectives as problematic rather than self-evident. But  Lessing’s text differs significantly from the sciences of chaos in its  vision of how order and disorder relate to each other. This complex relation is suggested by two complementary dreams  in The Golden Notebook  about spatial fragmentation and unity. In  the first, Ella dreams of the house in which Paul lived with his wife,  Muriel. Ella imagines that she now lives in “the ugly little house,  with its little rooms that were all different from each other.” She  attempts to unify the house by redecorating, but finds that “it was  holding together precisely because each room belonged to a different  epoch, a different spirit” (p. 225). The dream inscribes the belief  that fragmentation is necessary to prevent a collapse into chaos. At  the same time, the fractured contexts of the rooms make coherence  impossible. Fragmentation is thus both a symptom of chaos and a  defense against it. Later Anna dreams that she is looking down at the globe covered  by a “web of beautiful fabric stretched out.” The fabric glows with  colors representing the various countries— red for the Soviet Union,  black for Africa, and so on. As she watches, the colors melt and flow  into each other, forming “one beautiful glittering colour, but a col- our I have never seen in life.” Feeling “unbearable happiness,” she  realizes that the “world was slowly dissolving, disintegrating and  flying off into fragments, all through space, so that all around me </page> <page sequence="9"> 244 The Figure in the Carpet were weightless fragments drifting about. . . . The world had gone,  and there was chaos. I was alone in chaos.” Unable to catch the  meaning of the dream before it vanishes, she remembers only the  phrase “somebody pulled a thread of the fabric and it all dissolved”  (p. 299). The dream suggests that wholeness and chaos are very  close;* all that stands between them is a loose thread. Unity is thus  both the opposite of chaos and the prelude to it. Taken together, the two dreams make a larger statement. Ella’s  dream expresses the awareness that what is taken for global order in  classical paradigms is in fact only the partial order that each room  possesses when considered by itself. As long as one is content to stay  within a single room (each belonging, Ella says, to a “different ep- och, a different spirit” ), one can console oneself with the generaliza- tions that Lessing, in her essays written during this period, consis- tently labels “parochial.” 5 But when one attempts a transcendent  perspective such as Anna achieves for a moment in her dream, it is  unclear whether the larger picture will cohere into a mystical unity  or disintegrate into dissolution and chaos. The effect is very much  like what Anna feels in her dream, a complex undecidability that  hovers just outside the horizon of comprehensibility. This effect is quite different than that conveyed either by chaos  theory or by deconstruction, each of which is (like Lessing’s text)  centrally concerned with disorder. Although some “fuzzy” regions  always remain within maps of chaotic systems, chaos theory pro- vides a model for the mingling of order and disorder which is en- tirely rational and deterministic. As we saw earlier, the commitment  to rationality and to a noncontradictory global theory is one of the  important differences between chaos theory and deconstruction. De- construction, for its part, has renounced the possibility embodied in  Anna’s dream, that a transcendent viewpoint from which the whole  makes sense can be achieved. In The Golden Notebook , the tension  between order and disorder has been neither rationalized, as it is in  chaos theory, nor sharpened into an aporia, as it is in deconstruc- tion. Rather, chaos and order mirror each other, making the text’s  stance toward them undecidable in a way that is distinctly its own.  Later I shall return to explore the implications of this reflexivity for 5See, for example, Lessing, 1974:17. </page> <page sequence="10"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 24 j the peculiar ending of Lessing’s text. For the moment, I want to  emphasize that because The Golden Notebook  is on a cusp, it can  keep in suspension possibilities that later will be forced into one  path or another when the new paradigms become fully articulated. Disjunctions and Recursions: Global Visions and Local Politics The two dreams related above are characteristic of Ella and Anna,  in that they show Ella’s concern with the local and domestic, Anna’s  with the global and public. Ella is Anna’s fictional creation (just as  Anna is Lessing’s), and her anxieties are typically weaker, more con- ventional versions of Anna’s concerns. Anna is worried about global  destruction, Ella about clashing wallpaper. Like Ella, Anna is caught  in a love triangle with her married lover and his wife; but she is  never reduced so completely to the local as Ella is. Running along- side her account of her affair with Michael are her meditations on  her political activities in Africa and her experiences with the British  Communist Party. Flowever, the distinction between Anna and Ella  is not merely that Ella is Anna writ small. Part of Anna’s problem is  that she cannot see how to connect the domestic and public, the  local and global. In separating off a part of herself into Ella, Anna  practices fragmentation as a strategy of containment against chaos,  just as Ella does in her dream. The disjunction between the local and global is one of Lessing’s  major themes, appearing in different guises in the various note- books. In the blue notebook, it manifests itself in Anna’s belief that  she fell in love with Michael because he was a “real man,” calling  forth all of her response as a “real woman.” For Anna, the proof of  these essentialist ideas is the vaginal orgasm, which she stoutly de- fends as an infallible sign that the love she feels is real. Yet on Sep- tember 17, 1954, the day she resolves to write everything down just  as it happens, she records that Michael awakes and takes her sexu- ally because he hears Janet moving in the next room. She tries to  reason away her resentment at Michael’s jealousy of her child, as- serting that “the resentment, the anger, is impersonal. It is the dis- ease of women in our time” (p. 333). Nevertheless, when they are </page> <page sequence="11"> 146  The Figure in the Carpet finished, Anna feels resentment that is “suddenly so strong I clench  my teeth against it” (p. 334). She tries to make the best of the situa- tion, telling herself that the “two personalities—Janet’s mother,  Michael’s mistress, are happier separated. It is a strain having to be  both at once” (p. 336). Ironically, this separation ensures that even  if Michael were willing to leave his wife (and he is not), Anna and  her child could not live an integrated life with him. Living whole  would require Anna to confront Michael with her anger. She under- stands that if this confrontation were to occur, it could not be con- fined to the personal level. Behind her anger loom the assumptions  of a sexist society, just as behind his patronizing tone lies the tor- tured history of mid-twentieth-century Europe, including a family  killed in Nazi death camps and friends murdered in Prague by Com- munists. Paradoxically, fragmentation is necessary because every- thing is connected. Anna’s problems with Michael are rendered more problematic  and intense by the fractured contexts in which she lives. When Anna  refuses to take her anger seriously because “it is the disease of  women of our time,” she is caught in the disjunction between her  immediate reality and her global analysis. Avoiding confrontation,  she reassures herself that her relationship with Michael has a core of  reality because the stereotypical responses she uses to constitute it  are real. However, these responses reinscribe the very cultural his- tory that she seeks to escape when she insists they are genuine and  spontaneous expressions of her deepest self. To prevent these contra- dictions from surfacing, she uses suppression and fragmentation. Re- fusing to think about what Michael’s alienating and alienated com- ments signify, she finds her deepest pleasure in cooking for him, in  part because cooking does not engage her critical analytic self. The problem with this reading is that it makes it sound as if Less- ing intended to expose the contradictions Anna does not see. Ellen  Morgan, in her excellent article “Alienation of the Woman Writer in  The Golden N otebook” (1973), has shown that Anna’s refusal to  criticize Michael’s jealousy is part of a pervasive pattern in The  Golden Notebook  in which women negate their own responses  when they are critical of men. She draws the almost unavoidable  inference that such attitudes are also Lessing’s (p. 480). The consis- tency with which double standards for men and women appear in </page> <page sequence="12"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 247 The Golden Notebook  and elsewhere in Lessing’s writing has led  Marion Vlastos Libby to say plainly, “Doris Lessing is not a femi- nist, and The Golden Notebook  is not a feminist novel” (1974:106).  I agree with these conclusions; as Morgan and Libby argue, there is  every indication that Lessing sympathizes with Anna’s viewpoint. In  her 1971 Introduction, for example, when Lessing scolded her  readers for missing what she regarded as the point of her book, she  set up feminist readings of the text in opposition to the themes of  wholeness and fragmentation. Lessing’s inclination to bracket off  feminist issues, as if they were beside the point, suggests that she has  less insight into the way gender construction relates to fragmenting  contexts than the recursive symmetries of her text may suggest. Yet she also creates women characters strong enough to be, as  Libby says, “oddly at variance with the qualities revealed in their  other functions in life— with their independence and strength and  above all with their extraordinarily acute perception of the world”  (p. 109). The recursive structure is an important factor in reconciling  the tensions between Lessing’s strong women characters and her an- tifeminist presuppositions, for it occludes as well as reveals correla- tions between different sites. In Ella’s dream, fragmentation is identi- fied as an obstacle to unified understanding. At the same time, the  fragmented text allows different degrees of awareness to coexist,  held as it were in suspension by the recursive structure. The result is  a text fractal in its complexity, with areas of clear symmetry inter- mixed with other areas of suggestive but fuzzy replication. As the  narrative scrolls through the various notebooks, the same problems  and issues reappear at different sites. How clearly they come into  focus at each site depends largely, however, on the modality of the  site. The red notebook, with its thrust toward global understanding  and public action, has none of the obfuscations Anna practices in  the bedroom. Here the relation between fractured contexts and the  local/global split comes plainly into view. Anna says that she decided  to join the British Communist Party because she felt the “need for  wholeness, for an end to the split, divided, unsatisfactory way we all  live” (p. 161). Yet joining the party “intensified the split” (p. 161),  for in the wake of revelations about Stalin’s regime, party gatherings  splintered into factions. As attempts to overcome contradictions </page> <page sequence="13"> 248 The Figure in the Carpet within the Party give rise to more contradictions, the atmosphere of  party meetings edges toward hysteria. Anna recognizes the feeling  from her recurring dream about the figure whom she calls joy-in-  spite (p. 482). The dream figure, who appears in increasingly hu- manoid and familiar form as Anna comes closer to breakdown, is  chaos incarnate. His appearance signals that, although fragmenta- tion may initially be able to contain chaos, eventually it facilitates  and accelerates the crackup toward which Anna and apparently the  entire society are headed. The yellow notebook manages to be at once more archetypal and  trite than the blue notebook. The yellow notebook contains Anna’s  novel “The Shadow of the Third,” which fictionalizes Anna’s rela- tionship with Michael in Ella’s affair with Paul. The title refers only  obliquely to Anna’s relation to these two characters. Inside the novel  the third is Paul’s wife, Muriel, or more precisely Ella’s projected  image of Muriel. Claire Sprague, in “Doubletalk and Doubles Talk  in The Golden N otebook” (1982), notes that patterns of twos and  threes are pervasive in The Golden Notebook , constituting an elabo- rate play on doubles and projected selves. Aside from their psycho- logical interest, these patterns are significant because they show uni- fied contexts breaking up and re-forming into increasingly complex  configurations. As two people are aligned against a third, then as a  single person splits into two and one of these parts splits further to  make a third, the fragmentation becomes extremely complex. It re- calls the fracturing contexts of the British Communist Party, as well  as the shifting triad of Molly, Anna, and Mrs. Marks, the psychia- trist whose name suggests that her Freudian generalizations are like  Marxist analysis in their refusal to recognize the importance of local  differences. In the black notebook, the personal and public intermingle as  Anna recalls how futile and contradictory were the efforts of the  socialist group she joined in Africa. Dedicated to looking “at things  whole and in relation to each other” (as Lessing remarks of M arx- ism in her Introduction, p. xiv), the group quickly split in two, then  further splintered into factions within the subgroup headed by Willi,  Anna’s “official” partner. In retrospect, Anna can see how ironically  ineffectual the group was. Following Marxist doctrine, they delared  that the initiative for overcoming racism should come from the pro- </page> <page sequence="14"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 249 letariat, which in this case meant local labor unions. Black labor  unions did not exist, however, because blacks were not allowed to  organize, and the white unions were even more racist than most of  the society. Change, when it came, would be led by black national- ists. But the group disapproved in principle of nationalist move- ments, viewing them as a “right-wing deviation” (p. 90). Divorced  from the realities of the situation, the group began to retreat from  public action to private escape at the Mashopi Hotel. As Anna moves deeper into her recollections, the black notebook  becomes a kind of counternovel to her first novel, The Frontiers o f   War, which we know only through her parodie summaries and com- ments about it. In this counternovel, Anna recounts how the contra- dictions inherent in the group’s situation exploded when Paul Black-  enhurst, in a gesture that combined comradeship and arrogance,  befriended Jackson, the Boothbys’ black cook. As a result Jackson  was fired, and he was forced to take a job where he would not be  able to keep his family with him. When Anna expressed dismay,  Willi pointed out that Jackson had held exceptional privileges and  that most black men were not so lucky. “But I happen to know  Jackson and his family,” Anna objected, adding, “I can’t believe  what you say.” Willi responded, “Of course you can’t. Sentimental- ists can never believe in anything but their own emotions” (p. 148).  For Willi, only the global counts; the local does not matter.6 If the problem were merely a lack of connection between the local  and the global, communicating links between them could perhaps be  forged. The group’s response to the African situation, for example,  might have been corrected if they had started with local conditions  and built up toward generalizations, rather than trying to impose a  global theory onto the situation. One could imagine that they might  have contacted the black nationalists and centered their efforts on  helping them, rather than vainly looking to the labor unions. A simi- lar argument could be made about Anna’s personal relationships. 6This attitude is caricatured later by Molly’s husband, Richard, who remarks that  if he were the head of a secret police and given the task of identifying all the commu- nists in the country, he would offer to set them up in a small health clinic in Africa.  All the communists, he maintains, would say no. Although Richard has more than a  few faults of his own, his analysis is acute enough to force Anna into an uncomfort- able moment of recognition. </page> <page sequence="15"> 2 jo  The Figure in the Carpet She judges her experiences with men according to a Platonic ideal  that she holds in her head. If the relationship does not immediately  conform to her idea of what it should be, she dismisses it as second-  rate or not “real.” The notion that one could build intimacy, that  intimacy is the result of and not the precondition for shared experi- ence, seems not to occur to her until she meets Saul Green, and then  it takes a psychotic form. Like the socialist group in Africa, Anna  rejects local reality because it does not conform to her global expec- tations. Another version of the problem is to see people as merely symp- tomatic of their time, without individual personality. For example,  Anna sees Nelson and his frenetic wife as the victims of fractured  contexts that make wholeness impossible. She says to Mother Sugar  that there is a “crack in that man’s personality like a gap in a dam,  and through that gap the future might pour in a different shape—  terrible perhaps, or marvellous, but something new— ” (p. 473). The  perception is finely tuned. The scene with Nelson, his wife, and his  friends at the party recalls Andy Warhol’s quip that the essence of  postmodernism is being hyper and bored. Through the surface of the  boredom, crises keep erupting, fueled by the tremendous internal  pressure created by fear of global destruction. The inscription of the  global into these people overwhelms them as individuals, making it  impossible for Anna to relate to them as anything other than symp- toms of a common malaise. In a more conventional way, Ella senses  the same thing about Cy Maitland. Yet both Anna and Ella remain  confident that somewhere a “real man” exists who is so essentially  himself, so sure of his identity as a man, that they will be able to  respond to him as “real women” and thus be saved from being  merely expressions of their time. The problem, then, is not so simple as forging links between the  local and global, for the global collapses into the local, just as the  local reinscribes the global. In the last recursion through the blue  notebook before the pattern is broken and a new kind of symmetry  appears, Anna experiences a nostalgic glimpse of how the local/  global problematic might be resolved if mediating links could be  constructed. Returning to a childhood fantasy, she imagines herself  playing “the game.” First “I create the room I sat in, object by ob- ject, ‘naming’ everything, bed, chair, curtains, till it was whole in my </page> <page sequence="16"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 251 mind, then move out of the room, creating the house, then out of the  house, slowly creating the street, then rise into the air, looking down  at London . . . but holding at the same time the room and the house  and the street in my mind, and then England . . . then slowly, slowly,  I could create the world.” Having attained a position in space from  which she could see the vast panorama of the cosmos, she would  “try to imagine at the same time, a drop of water, swarming with  life, or a green leaf. Sometimes I could reach what I wanted, a simul- taneous knowledge of vastness and of smallness” (p. 548). It is sig- nificant that Anna’s approach to this knowledge is through a truer  naming, and that the naming comes out of a heightened individual  sensitivity. The naming game implies that the local/global split could  be resolved if she (and we) could break through to a purer use of  language by practicing a more intense and aware subjectivity. Subjectivity and Chaos: The Question o f  Form In The Golden N otebook , the ordering principle that keeps chaos  at bay is critical and analytical consciousness. Recall, for example,  Anna’s belief that her consciousness is the focal point that alone can  provide the synthesizing perspective necessary to bring chaotic infor- mation into a semblance of order. However, the attempt by an indi- vidual consciousness to resolve the local/global split is complicated,  because subjectivity itself is necessarily local and global, in the sense  that it is at once intensely personal and an expression of its culture. Subjectivity is a highly charged issue for Lessing. As a Western  writer with communist sympathies, she is torn between locating the  springs of art in an individual consciousness and locating them in a  collective spirit. Anna, scanning material published in communist  countries to find if it is suitable for British audiences, finds most of  the writing “bad, dead, banal.” She feels “forced to acknowledge  that the flashes of genuine art are all out of deep, suddenly stark,  undisguisable private emotion” (p. 349). She recalls a lecture on me- dieval art in which she told her audience that “art during the Middle  Ages was communal, unindividual; it came out of a group con- sciousness. It was without the driving painful individuality of the art  of the bourgeois era. And one day, we will leave behind the driving </page> <page sequence="17"> 252 The Figure in the Carpet egotism of individual art. . . . Art from the West . . . becomes more  and more a shriek of torment from souls recording pain” (p. 350).  In the middle of the lecture, however, she started to stammer. “I  know what that stammer meant,” she declares, and thereafter gives  no more lectures on art. Lessing quotes the passage in her 1971  Introduction, adding that Anna stammered because she was evading  the recognition that “there was no way of not being intensely subjec- tive; it was, if you like, the writer’s task for that time” (p. xiii). On  the one hand, Lessing implies that we believe we are self-determined  individuals only because our culture makes us think so. On the  other, we can understand our culture only if we plunge into the  subjectivity it has inscribed within us. In her Introduction, Lessing says that the way out of preoccupa- tion with the “tiny individual who is at the same time caught up in  such an explosion of terrible and marvellous possibilities, is to see  him as a microcosm and in this way to break through the personal,  the subjective, making the personal . . . into something much larger:  growing up is after all only the understanding that one’s unique and  incredible experience is what everyone shares” (p. xiii). This resolu- tion, like Anna’s lecture, is evading something. If the individual is  merely an expression of the culture, then the spark of “suddenly  stark, undisguisable private emotion” that Anna identifies with  “genuine art” has no meaning. A similar evasion occurs in Lessing’s  essay “The Small Personal Voice.” There Lessing says she holds “the  view that the realist novel, the realist story, is the highest form of  prose writing” (1974:4). In pondering what it is that draws her to  the great novels of the past, she admits that “I was not looking for a  firm reaffirmation of the old ethical values, many of which I don’t  accept; I was not in search of the pleasures of familiarity. I was  looking for the warmth, the compassion, the humanity, the love of  people that . . . makes all these old novels a statement of faith in  man himself” (p. 6). At the same time, “if one is going to be an  architect, one must have a vision to build towards, and that vision  must spring from the nature of the world we live in.” (p. 7). How  can the writer simultaneously express her culture and position her- self above it, directing it into new paths? The conundrum suggests  that the tension between the individual and the collective is not so  easily resolved as Lessing asserts. </page> <page sequence="18"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 253 What Lessing circles around but never directly confronts is the  possibility that the microcosm/macrocosm correlation between the  individual and the culture may itself be an artifact of bourgeois indi- viduality. As we saw in chapter 8, received ideas about Western indi- viduality were transported into scientific and mathematical models  during the Enlightenment through the assumption that complex ob- jects could be represented as collections of autonomous units mov- ing along a continuous time line. It is no accident that in these  models one can move easily from the individual unit to the global  system; such a movement is possible because the assumptions used  to constitute the individual unit are replicated in the assumptions  used to construct the system. In the new paradigms, movement up  from the individual unit to the system, or down from the system to  the individual unit, is no longer an assumed characteristic but a  focus for inquiry. Lessing oversimplifies when she suggests that one  can resolve this problematic simply by regarding the individual as a  microcosm of the global system, for such movement is possible or  easy only under a narrow set of conditions. More to the point, she  reduces the tensions embodied in her text to a formulation far too  neat to encompass their unruly complexities. The Golden Notebook (as distinct from Lessing’s representation  of it) presents two different enactments of how individual sensibility  and collective spirit relate. In the first, global vision and local experi- ence are joined through heightened subjectivity. Because no funda- mental changes are transacted in the way human consciousness is  constituted or represented, this enactment defuses the more radical  implications of a collapse into chaos. In the second enactment, the  split between local and global mounts in intensity until it forces a  crisis, from which emerges a text that may appear to be the same as  the previous writing but in fact operates according to very different  premises. These two enactments represent a profound ambivalence  toward the transforming significance of chaos as a new paradigm.  At issue is whether chaos can be contained within old forms of ex- pression and representation, or whether it will precipitate a sea-  change in human experience and art. In her later works, Lessing  increasingly took the second path, welcoming and calling forth the  transformative power of chaos. But in The Golden Notebook  both  possibilities are active; both call for belief and commitment. The </page> <page sequence="19"> Z54 The Figure in the Carpet result is a text that is enormously complex because it is balanced  between two paradigms, partaking of both and reducible to neither. This complexity is encoded within the novel’s form. On the one  hand, the form demonstrates the failure of the novel to cohere, con- sisting as it does of fragments spliced together. Yet the symmetry  suggests that some kind of reorganization takes place in the inner  “Golden Notebook,” which ought then to be apparent in the final  “Free W omen” section. In this reading, The Golden Notebook  as a  whole would possess the coherence that eludes its fragmented parts,  for it chronicles the emergence of a new mode of integrated experi- ence and, presumably, a new way of writing. Whether we think that  this reorganization has in fact occurred depends in part on who we  think is writing the text. As Joseph Hynes has pointed out in his meticulous study “The  Construction of The Golden N otebook” (1973), the answer to  “Who writes this text?” is not obvious. In one sense, of course, Less- ing writes it; but within the text itself, Anna is the author. Which  Anna? As Hynes observes, several versions of Anna are inscribed in  the four notebooks and the “Free W omen” sections. Moreover, the  text we have before us is neither the notebooks themselves nor a  transcription of them. Rather, it is an edited collage considerably  more distanced than the original texts toward which it points. To  explain who wrote the text as it is, Hynes suggests that we posit a  figure whom he calls Anna-the-editor, a character who has already  experienced everything the Annas of the notebooks and “Free  Women” sections record, and who retrospectively assembles, ar- ranges, and edits these accounts. To illustrate how the edited text differs from the fragments that  supposedly comprise it, consider how the black notebook starts. We  are not given the beginning; instead, we are presented with a de- scription of it. Anna-the-editor, writing in brackets, tells us that the  “first book, the black notebook, began with doodlings, scattered  musical symbols, treble signs that shifted into the sign £ and back  again; then a complicated design of interlocking circles, then  words:]” (p. 56, emphasis added). The semiotic level at which the  black notebook began before it moved into language is thus sup- pressed, since in our edited version everything has been transcribed  into words, even the nonverbal symbols. One way to understand this  transposition is to suppose that it is a recuperation of the novel’s </page> <page sequence="20"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 255 traditional retrospective function that was apparently lost in the ex- ploding fragmentation recorded within its parts. This recuperation  in turn depends on the recovery of a subjectivity unified enough to  engage in retrospection, that is, Anna-the-editor. In this reading,  both Anna-the-editor and her completed text are wholes that con- tain but are not reducible to the sum of their parts. This is not the whole story, however, for it does not explain the  peculiarly parodie nature of the ending. Nor does it adequately rec- ognize that the description of the notebooks that Anna-the-editor  gives us is in many ways a diminished, attenuated version of what  actually reading them would have been. The experience of moving  through the notebooks, of encountering the transitions from one  kind of handwriting to another, from handwriting to pasted clip- ping, from clear text to brackets, from brackets to canceled text,  would surely have been different not just in degree but in kind from  the information Anna-the-editor gives us. Thus as readers, we un- dergo the alienation that Benjamin identifies as characteristic of an  information age, because we are reduced from experiencing the texts  directly to being told about them by Anna-the-editor. This implies  that the recuperation of a unified subjectivity and a retrospective  novelistic function are not in fact recoveries of what had been lost,  but a simulation that is essentially different from the original. Break/Down/Up; or, W hat H appened at the Bifurcation Point? In her Introduction, Lessing says that the plan of The Golden  Notebook is to document the encroaching presence of chaos, until in  the inner “Golden N otebook” even the traditional forms of time and  space break down; out of this chaos something new is to emerge.  The question that comes sharply into focus as breakdown ap- proaches is whether individual consciousness, as it has been tradi- tionally constituted in the Western tradition, can provide the unified  context necessary to bring these splintering fragments together. Or  more accurately, since what we are reading is a fictional representa- tion of that consciousness, whether the conventions of realistic nar- ratives can continue to constitute individual consciousness as a puta- tive source for “genuine art,” or whether the disintegration of the </page> <page sequence="21"> z ^ 6  The Figure in the Carpet subject will precipitate a crisis in representation which makes a tra- ditional novel impossible to write. The self-reflexive turn of this con- struction, which links the writing subject with the subject of the  writing, becomes explicit in the inner “Golden Notebook,” which  records Anna’s breakdown and her entry into new visions of space  and time. Even as Anna experiences herself fragmenting into many different  people, a countermovement begins that emphasizes fusion and  wholeness. The invisible “projectionist,” running the film that is at  once Anna’s life and her writing, screens a part she has not seen  before which shows Michael merging with his fictionalized double,  Paul, to create a new person with “the heroic quality of a statue” (p.  618). This figure, himself an image of art joined with life, gives  Anna a message that valorizes her earlier attempt to join the local  with the global in the naming game. He tells her that he and she will  never be great men or women, envisioning a new future for human- kind. Rather, they are destined to be “boulder-pushers,” using “all  our energies, all our talents, into pushing that boulder another inch  up the mountain. And they [the great men] will rely on us and they  are right; and that is why we are not useless after all” (p. 618). The  thought that she is a Sisyphean “boulder-pusher” remains with  Anna throughout this section. It is echoed and reinforced in another  playback of the film, when she recognizes for the first time how  thoughtlessly cruel she has been to people around her. She realizes  that “the film was now beyond my experience, beyond Ella’s, be- yond the notebooks, because there was a fusion; and instead of see- ing separate scenes, people, faces, movements, glances, they were all  together.” She understands that the film is about “a small painful  sort of courage which is at the the root of every life, because injus- tice and cruelty is at the root of life.” She recognizes that she had  concentrated on the “heroic or beautiful or the intelligent” because  she could not accept this truth, and as a consequence missed seeing  the central importance of “the small endurance that is bigger than  anything” (pp. 635-636). In this new perception, scaling back her  ambition does not signal failure. Rather, it represents a necessary  acceptance of the local. It answers Maryrose’s question, “W hat’s  wrong with not settling for second-best?” with the insight that to  refuse the local is arrogance, not purity. From the perspective of the “boulder-pushers” passage, readers </page> <page sequence="22"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 257 who object to the conventional nature of the ending are clinging to  the illusion of dramatic revolution rather than accepting the reality  of incremental change. Throughout, there have been intimations that  revolutions too often turn out to be merely changes in personnel  which leave underlying power structures intact, like the prisoner and  guard who change places in Anna’s nightmare (p. 345). Real change,  Lessing seems to suggest, comes only when one devotes one’s efforts  to improving (however slightly) the place where one is, rather than  retreating to global visions of what the world should ideally be like. And yet this is hardly the whole story. Certainly it is not the most  interesting story. It elides the deeper questions raised by Anna’s en- counter with chaos, and provides no satisfactory account of the ex- traordinarily complex structure of the novel. If Anna-the-editor is  reducible to a boulder-pusher, why would she need to create so in- cendiary a form and resurrect so many dangerous possibilities? In  her Introduction, Lessing skips rather lightly over these issues. She  asserts that “in the inner Golden Notebook things come together,  the divisions have broken down, there is formlessness with the end  of fragmentation— the triumph of the second theme, which is unity”  (p. vii). Compare this description with the text we have; is it ade- quate? After the searing intensity of Anna’s psychotic episodes with  Saul, surely most readers will find the end of the inner “Golden  Notebook” attentuated and laconic by comparison. The final “Free  Women” section is even more of a disappointment, with Molly re- treating into the bourgeois respectability of a marriage to a “pro- gressive businessman” who resembles her ex-husband, Richard, and  Anna announcing that she intends to work as a marriage counselor  with Dr. N orth,7 join the Labour party, and teach night classes twice  a week for delinquent youngsters. For a character who has repre- sented herself as having undergone radical personality transforma- tions, including fragmenting into multiple personae and losing all  sense of conventional time and space, these are mild decisions in- deed. Rather than displaying increased complexity, the closing “Free  W omen” section seems to be a parodie recapitulation of the opening 7Dr. North’s name seems to indicate that he is the model for the fictional Dr.  West, for whom Ella works. If we may judge him by the portrait of Dr. West that  Ella draws, Anna’s decision to work with Dr. North to save troubled marriages  seems even more questionable than it would otherwise appear. </page> <page sequence="23"> z$S The Figure in the Carpet “Free W omen” chapter, demonstrating the complete futility of all  that has happened between them. In her 1971 Introduction, Lessing does not acknowledge this as a  possibility. Instead she asserts that the inner “Golden N otebook”  brings the fragmented sites of The Golden Notebook  together into a  successful synthesis, signified by the fact that it is written jointly by  Saul and Anna. At this point, Lessing writes, “you can no longer  distinguish between what is Saul and what is Anna, and between  them and the other people in the book.” According to her, this fu- sion of characters “is a way of self-healing, of the self’s dismissing  false dichotomies and divisions” (p. viii). Lessing’s representation of  the text here glosses over an important distinction. It is not quite  true that Anna and Saul collaborate in writing the inner “Golden  Notebook.” Rather, they write the imagined precursor to the text  we have, the Ur-text to which our text alludes when Anna-the-editor  tells us, in brackets, “ [Here Anna’s handwriting ended, the golden  notebook continued in Saul Green’s handwriting, a short novel  about the Algerian soldier]” (p. 642). A summary of the novel fol- lows, not the novel itself'. Thus Anna-the-editor writes the inner  “Golden Notebook,” just as she has written all that has come before  and after. Lessing’s elision of Anna and Saul with Anna-the-editor is signifi- cant because it points to an undecidable crux within the text. If  Anna-the-editor is really Anna-and-Saul, we have no way to know  that. The undecidability is made more profound by the recuperation  at the end. If a new order has emerged, its nature is such as to make  it indistinguishable from the old. What does it signify that success  looks so much like failure, and that the emergence of a new order  cannot be separated from its suppression? These questions have en- tered the criticism on The Golden Notebook as a debate about  whether or not the ending is satisfactory.8 I want to recast the terms 8Readers who defend the ending include John L. Carey, in “Art and Reality in The  Golden Notebook,” Contemporary Literature 14 (1973): 4 3 7 -4 5 6 ;  Carey writes  that the ending demonstrates that “to exist is better than not to exist, to struggle  is better than to give in, to face the truth and live with it is the measure of an indi- vidual’s maturity” (p. 454). Valerie Carnes, in “ ‘Chaos, That’s the Point’: Art as  Metaphor in Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook,” World Literature Written  in English 15 (1976): 17—28, gives a somewhat more qualified endorsement, ac- knowledging that the ending is “tentative, modest, shot through with irony” (p. 27). </page> <page sequence="24"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 259 of that debate by suggesting that there is a deep ambiguity about the  ending which eludes an either/or resolution. Rather than a new or- der emerging out of chaos, it appears that the old and new orders  have interpenetrated in a way that eludes rational analysis. To tell this story, it is necessary to put aside for the moment a  recuperative reading and suppose that the ending is about a radical  reorganization that emerges after all. How would individual con- sciousness be constituted, and through what narrative and literary  conventions could it be represented? A reading that attempted to  answer these questions would have to be centrally concerned with  form, for if a sea-change is to take place, it could be signaled only by  a transformation of the premises underlying representation. Let us  return to the beginning, then, and cycle through the text one more  time, now taking the other path at the bifurcation point. The N ew  Order: Emergence o f  a Simulacrum In her talk with Molly at the beginning of The Golden Notebook ,  Anna says that a well-known painter has announced that he is giving  up painting because “the world is so chaotic art is irrelevant” (p.  42). The statement recalls Morse Peckham’s thesis in Man's Rage for  Chaos (1967) that the purpose of art is to break paradigms and  assault established conventions, so that the replicating mechanisms  that ensure the stability of the species will be invested with the nec- essary flexibility to ensure that change can also happen. And yet art  also creates form; indeed, one might say that the essence of an artis- tic creation is its status as a shaped artifact. An art object without  form is a contradiction in terms. Even if its form is such as to convey  an impression of formlessness, it has still been designed and shaped  with this purpose in mind. Throughout The Golden Notebook , Anna wrestles with the trans- formation that takes place when fleeting thoughts are transcribed Typical of readings that find the ending disappointing is Kathleen McCormick,  “What Happened to Anna Wulf: Naivety in The Golden Notebook ,” Massachusetts  Studies in English 8 (1982): 5 6 -6 2 ;  McCormick says that the “reader is engaged,  but ultimately disappointed by Anna’s near-achievements” (p. 57). </page> <page sequence="25"> i6 o  The Figure in the Carpet into a text. Once on the page, the words seem more fixed than they  ever did in consciousness— more formed , especially when they are  thoughts about chaos. In trying to explain to Mrs. Marks why she  does not write for publication any more, Anna refers to this trans- forming process as a falsification, insisting, “It’s a question of  form.” She goes on to say that contemporary readers will tolerate or  welcome almost any moral aberration in their reading; but what  “they can’t stand is to be told it all doesn’t matter, they can’t stand  formlessness” (p. 474). In The Golden N otebook , Lessing confronts  the possibility that formlessness is truer to this cultural moment than  form. However, she has only the inherited forms of her cultural tra- ditions with which to convey this vision. Richard’s pious hypocrisy  that “I preserve the forms” (p. 26) resonates until, near the end, it  becomes Anna’s explanation for why she will write The Golden  Notebook as she does. The moment when Anna conceives the text, and therefore the mo- ment when Anna-the-editor is conceived, is represented within the  text. It occurs when Saul gives Anna the first sentence of her novel,  which is also the first sentence of The Golden Notebook . The struc- ture is thus self-reflexive as well as recursive, in the sense that the  parts (the Annas of the different sections, the transcriptions of the  notebooks) are contained within the whole at the same time that the  whole (Anna-the-editor, The Golden Notebook  as a finished text) is  mirrored within the part. One of the characteristics of a self-swallowing structure is infinite  regress. Recall Borges’s meditation on The 1001 Nights.9 Borges  notes that enfolded among the tales that Scheherazad tells is the  most dangerous story of all. It occurs on Night 602, the evening  when she decides that she will tell her own story. One can imagine  her starting the story; when she arrives at the point where she de- cides to tell her story, however, she slips from the original recitation  into an inner story that starts the narrative anew. From this inner  story, she will at the crucial moment of self-reflexive mirroring slip  into a doubly interior story, and from there into a triply interior 9Jorge Luis Borges, “The Translators of The 1001 Nights ” pp. 7 3 -8 7 ,  especially  86, and “Partial Enchantments of the Q u i x o t e pp. 232.-2.34, especially 234, both  in Borges, 1981. </page> <page sequence="26"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 261 story. . . . Unless some outside force intervenes, she will be caught in  an endless recursion, each story nested inside its predecessor like an  infinite series of Chinese boxes. “Does the reader perceive the unlim- ited possibilities of that interpolation, the curious danger— that the  Sultana may persist and the Sultan, transfixed, will hear forever the  truncated story of The 1001 Nights, now infinite and circular,”  Borges asks (1981:234). In The Golden N otebook , the moment of slippage is not so dan- gerous, for it is only the first sentence that is repeated, not the entire  story. Coming at the end of the inner “Golden Notebook,” however,  this moment is enough to raise questions about the status of the  “Free W omen” section that follows. What if at the self-reflexive  junction the narrative slips from the epistemological framework that  contains the story up to that point and enters another frame in  which the forms may be perserved but the entire orientation is dif- ferent? In that case, the final “Free W omen” section would be nei- ther a realistic working out of scaled-down expectations nor a par- ody of the initial “Free Women” chapter, but a simulacrum, a copy  that has no original. It has no original because it does not exactly  repeat either the beginning or the penultimate inner “Golden Note- book.” Nevertheless, it is a copy in the sense that it is caught in a  recursive loop. As a result, the text is a representation of its failure  to represent what it points toward but can never reach. Anna says as much as she approaches the moment when the text  will swallow itself like the uroborus, the snake with its tail in its  mouth. “During these last weeks of craziness and timelessless,” she  writes, “I’ve had these moments of ‘knowing’ one after the other, yet  there is no way of putting this sort of knowledge into words. Yet  these moments have been so powerful, like the rapid illuminations of  a dream that remain with one waking, that what I have learned will  be a part of how I experience life until I die. Words. Words. I play  with words, hoping that some combination, even a chance combina- tion, will say what I want. . . . ” If we take Anna at her word(s),  whether the ending is a simulacrum or a representation is inherently  undecidable, since the informing experience that distinguishes the  two is itself beyond words. “The people who have been there, in the  place where words, patterns, order, dissolve, will know what I mean  and the others won’t,” Anna writes (pp. 633—634). </page> <page sequence="27"> z6z  The Figure in the Carpet Even though the confirming experience cannot be shared through  language, it effects a change that will make the illuminati cognizant  that what follows is not the thing itself, or a representation of the  thing, but a simulacrum. This knowledge registers itself as irony.  “But once having been there there’s a terrible irony, a terrible shrug  of the shoulders, and it’s not a question of fighting it, or disowning  it, or of right or wrong, but simply knowing it is there, always. . . .  All right, I know you are there, but we have to preserve the forms,  don’t we?” (p. 634). In this view, the conundrum of how to create a  form that will represent formlessness, how to forge a context that  will make sense of a context of no context, is to create a pastiche  whose fragmentation accelerates until it implodes into a new kind of  form, the simulacrum. This is the transformation that Anna senses in  the depth of her madness, when she writes that something “has to be  played out, some pattern has to be worked through” (p. 583). To position this reading more fully, I want to compare and con- trast it with Jean Baudrillard’s (1981, 1983) concept of the sim- ulacrum. To illustrate what Baudrillard means by a simulacrum,  consider the following progression. In ancient times, animals were  killed for food and their skins were used as warm, utilitarian cover- ings. As animals grew scarce, their furs became status symbols, signi- fying wealth and privilege. Since there were not enough real furs to  go around, simulated furs were produced to fill the demand create  by those who aspired to the illusion of wealth but did not possess  the money to buy real furs. At first these synthetic furs were mar- keted as copies of the originals. As more and more copies were pro- duced, however, they began to compete on the basis of their superi- ority to other copies. At some point the original disappeared  altogether, no longer serving to anchor the chain of these proliferat- ing signifiers. Then the copies “imploded” into a new order of non-  referential signification that operated by displacement rather than  representation. Baudrillard calls this the “hyper-real,” a theater  where everything is at once nonreferential and as real as anything  else. The emergence of an information age was crucial in bringing  about this implosion, for it provided the technology that distanced  an object so far from its putative origin that the origin could not be  recovered, even in theory. A capitalistic economy was also impor- </page> <page sequence="28"> Fracturing Forms: The Golden Notebook 263 tant, for the displacement of desire onto a succession of copies cre- ated the expanding commodity market that capitalism needs to stave  off collapse. It goes without saying that Lacanian psychology and  poststructural linguistics were also important precursors to the idea  of the simulacrum, for they carried the absence of origin into the  formation of the psyche and the structure of language. To connect the simulacrum with Lessing’s text, consider another  progression. One of the earliest successful children’s television shows  was H owdy Doody. Howdy was technologically simple. He was an  obvious if crude copy of a human being, and he needed a human  nearby to manipulate him and supply him with his voice. Howdy  was soon superseded by the cartoon programs he introduced, which  were at a further remove technologically from their human inven- tors, and also at a further remove physically from the human form.  With computer animation came figures that were increasingly less  anthropomorphic, including characters that combined human and  machine parts. Finally M ax Headroom arrived on the scene. Max  was not a copy of a human being, as Howdy was, but a simulacrum.  M ax’s essential quality was his nonreferential status with respect to  the human. Since he lived in the TV sceen, he was both a representa- tion and the thing itself. This disturbing convergence of the represen- tation with its referent is characteristic of the simulacrum. Once we  have entered into this space, the distinction between the copy and  the original ceases to have meaning. At this point we live within the  hyper-real, and ourselves have become it. In suggesting that the final “Free Women” section is a sim- ulacrum, I mean to invoke the associations with which Baudrillard  invests the term, for I think they are nascently present in Lessing’s  text. If Anna-the-editor is not a scaled-down version of the Annas  who wrote the notebooks, she must be a simulacrum, a copy that  has no original. Similarly, if The Golden Notebook  is identical nei- ther with its parts nor with a synthetic, integrated whole toward  which it nostalgically gestures, then it too is a copy with no original.  This reading brings out the most disturbing and refractory aspects of  The Golden Notebook , for it places the text along a path that Bau- drillard and others would develop further. I do not want to push the analogy too far, because The Golden  Notebook  also differs from Baudrillard’s simulacrum in important </page> <page sequence="29"> z 64 The Figure in the Carpet ways. For example, although the reality that the final “Free  Women” section gestures toward cannot be represented, it may nev- ertheless exist, whereas Baudrillard’s point is that reality and our  representations of it have collapsed into the same space. Whether  this implosion actually takes place in The Golden Notebook remains  undecidable, an indication that Lessing’s text is caught between two  paradigms. It has no choice but to reenact the old, for those are the  only forms available; and yet by pushing the forms to (and perhaps  beyond) the limits of their assumptions, it gestures toward the new. One of the insights that Anna has when she is listening to the  “projectionist” is how thin the line is between her own writing and  the “style of the most insipid coy woman’s magazine”— perhaps the  magazine Ella works for (p. 620). Changing “a word here and there  only,” Anna transforms her style into a parody of her writing and of  herself. That thin line keeps The Golden Notebook  from entering  the hyper-real. In being able to distinguish her authentic voice from  a parody, Anna retains a sense of the reality of her subjectivity, and  consequently of its potential as a source for her art. Thus the ending  can be read as a réinscription of the values that underlie the realistic  novel, and more generally of the assumptions that make modernist  representations possible. But it can also be read as signaling the  transformation of the text into a postmodern collage of information,  in which parody does not exist because the center did not hold. The  ambiguity points toward a profound duality within the new para- digms— whether they imply the renewal of human subjectivity as it  has traditionally been constituted or its demise. </page> </plain_text>
