<plain_text><page sequence="1">358 J. A. FARRER.-Savage andl Civilized Warfare. SAVAGE and CIVILIZED WARFARE. By J. A. FARRER, Esq. NOTHING perhaps is imore characteristic of the wide difference between savagery and civilization than the fact that the one chooses the past aind the other the future as the playground for its dreams of a happier condition of humanity. The one believes in the lapse, the other in the progress, of mankind. There is evidently all the practical difference in the world between these two modes of regarding history. The Hervey Islander, for instance, who has his fanciful myth of the golden age when wars were not, anld of the train of sad events that first brought them upon earth, is not thereby led to the idea of contributing by his own efforts to the restoration of peace upon earth, but is rather disposed to accept a state of warfare as part of the unalterable miseries of existence. But the civilized man who sees before and not behind him the light of better days, himself unconsciously aids, by the inere fact of his historical faith, in the accomplishment of the end he dreams of, and hastens the advent of the future he desires. It is a melancholy reflection that in this difference of regard- ing the problem of war, lies almost the only real difference between savage and civilized communities in the general matter of warfare. There is, indeed, a superficial difference between them in their tactics, weapons, usages; a civilized army does not actually worship a war-god, does not mutilate its dead foes, nor sacrifice nor torture its prisoners; and it sometimes, or generally, spares the lives of women and children. But there is no such difference as to make the expression civilized warfare other than the most flagrant contradiction of terms-a contra- diction which frequently leads to the strangest possible dis- tortion of moral ideas, as, for instance, in that very prevalent confusion of thought, which can see no harm in sticking a man with a bayonet, but the utmost barbarity in doing so with an assegai, which would teach us indeed to refrain from mutilating the dead whilst inculcatino, no scruples as to what extent we muatilate the living. TIere may be, and of course are, degrees in the savagery and cruelty of warfare; but warfare can no more be civilized than a circle can be a square, or a cold thing hot. Indeed, warfare is all the worse which claims to be civilized, or as Mr. Bancroft has well said, " War is a barbarism which civilization only intensifies." There exists in the world a popular form of sophistry which</page><page sequence="2">J. A. FARRER.-Savage and Civilized Warfare. 359 seeks to free certain phenomena from the reproach of being evil by showing that they may lead or have led to good results, thereby as hopelessly confusing means and ends as if it were contended that pain, undergone for health's sake, were not in itself evil qUa pain, or that a theft could be morally good which was intended for a charitable object. Without applying this theory to the subject of war, it is nevertheless obvious that civilization has owed so much to war, that it even seems as if, without the one, the other might have been unattainable. From the necessity of combination for purposes of offence or defence arose the social capacity for community of life and action generally; and whatever there is in the world of complex political association, or of wide areas of political union within which culture may peaceably advance, owes its existence to the pressure of constant hostile relations. It is upon a military model that social order everywhere has been gradually organ- ized, with its political and ecclesiastical hierarchies, its powers within powers, its ranks under ranks, its concentration of authority; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has drawn a most instruc- tive parallel, showing how the form of government of any people varies with, or even depends on, its military character, and how, whilst the tendency of war is towards despotism in government, the tendency of peace is towards liberty. Among people like the Esquimaux, who are said not even to know what war means, political chieftainship appears in its most rudimentary type; whilst in the civilized world a war-seeking policy leads surely and swiftly to growth of despotism at home. Connected with the subject of war in savage life, it is inter- esting to trace briefly the effect of military necessities on the political and religious development of savage races. Politically, their effect seems uniformly to have taken the direction of tightening the reins of government and of widening the dis- tinctionis between classes. There is no condition of things under which men's different qualities of courage and cunning tend more constantly to become prominent, and to prodtuce and perpetuate more strongly-pronounced inequalities, than the hostile relations in which savage communities so frequently stand to one another. In this fighting state, which is not necessarily, be it said, to be assumed as the primitive or natural state of mankind, the social privileges accorded to superior courage are those naturally exacted by suiperior might; and it is conceivable that the general right of inheritance had its origin in the once exorbitant claims of savage captains in war. Among many savages, even of no advanced type, military leadership is hereditary, if not on the eldest son then on some other son or relatioii of a deceased warrior; it is seldom purely elective, or</page><page sequence="3">360 J. A. FARRAR.-Savage and Civilized Warfare. allotted to personal merit. It would be difficult to understand this tendency among savages to create hereditable honours or functions, were it not for the close connection that exists in savage life between war and sorcery, the warrior and the magi- cian, and the consequent readiness to deify a great conqueror, even to the clothing of his nearest of kin with attributes of divinity. Given a great warrior and sorcerer, like their ancestor whom the Namaqua Hottentots worship as divine, and the idea becomes intelligible, that for any one save his own son or brother to succeed to his possessions or his power would con- stitute the deepest profanity to his memory, the grossest viola- tion of respect towards the deceased, and one within his power to avenge from his vigilant survival in the spirit-world. The gradual extension of such a feeling from military to civil life would be but another illustration of the tendency of conceptions of military origin to pass into power over the whole range of human action and thought. The same tendency again to deify warriors or their relations, causes similar lines of demarcation to arise between a warrior and non-warrior class, raising the former immeasurably above the latter, and conferring upon it attributes which contribute strongly to the preservation of social distinctions, and to the maintenance of a hierarchy of classes or castes.- The feeling in Greece that a commercial life as compared with a political or military one was base and ignoble, and the prejudice still existent in England in favour of a profession whose object is manslaughter, is the same feeling which in the Tongan Islands kept the Mooas and Tooas in contented subjection and sub- ordination to the higher classes, the priests and nobles. It is beyond doubt that civilization has been indebted to such a con- dition of things; for the division of society into classes implies a division of labour, and from a division of labour arises the best or only possibility of new arts and inventions. It is precisely where a pacific life is possible or preferred, that not only is the political structure of the simplest and loosest kind, but the material development is of the lowest description. If we inquire next what influence war has had on the re- ligious advancement of savages, it will appear that there again it has been very considerable, in giving shape and consistency to -men's ideas of the supernatural. The theology scarcely exists in the world, wherein the relation between the worshipper and his deity is not formed on the analogy of the relationship that connects the subject with his conqueror, or a lower with a higher caste. Hence it is that primitive theology is not only anthropomorphic, but anthropomorphic on a bellicose model. The chief god becomes the god of battles, the conqueror of other</page><page sequence="4">J. A. FARRER.-Savage and Civilized Warfare. 361 peoples' gods, as in Israel; the terrible war-god, as in ancient Mexico. The homage due to him therefore finds its exemplar ready to hand in the homage paid to earthly potentates; and the conceptions of him, of his attributes and wishes, are pre- cisely those entertained of human warriors and illustrious heroes. If a human monarch receives, and is gratified by tributes of oxen, fruit, or slaves, similar tributes or sacrifices will be paid, as they are all over the world, to the gods; cattle and men being slain to do them honour, or, more usually, to procure their favour. If, as in Turkey to this day, the burning of incense be a recognised mode of showing reverence to a superior, such an act of homage will be naturally transferred to the worship of the gods; and we actually find it so not only in the pipe of the Red Indian, but in the practice of every church and chapel of Catholic Christendom. The prevalence of the ideas of sacrifice and incense in the highest religion of the world sufficiently indicates the extent to which religion among the lower races is likely to be formulated in accordance with the principles of military dominion; and if, in the formation of political society, some benefit may be ascribed to the action of war, it is difficult to name a single benefit that has accrued to the world from this close and constant association between military and religious ideas. The religion of the Khonds of Orissa may be taken as a fair illustration of the pernicious influence exercised by a military life upon all the virtues associated with the higher claims of morality-those, namely, of humanity and goodwill to a neigh- bouring community. The conception of the Deity as the arbiter or even the cause of war, is carried by the Khonds to a degree which, if pardonable in their condition, is certainly none the more pleasing. Wars they never consider to be their own act or their own fault; they are always the act and will of their war-god, Loha Pennu. Every village has a grove sacred to Loha Pennu, and whenever fevers or tigers rage or ravage it is accepted as a hint from Loha Pennu that his service has beei too long neglected. The extent to which they carry this theory of the divine origin of war is well seen in part of the prayer they use when peace is restored: " Loha Pennu said to himself, Let there be war, and he forthwith entered into all weapons, so that from instruments of peace they becanme weapons of war; he gave edge to the axe, and point to the arrow; he entered into all kinds of food and drink, so that men in eating and drinking were filled with rage, and women became instruments of discord instead of soothers of anger." This is an admirable way of disposing of those conscientious scruples about the justice or injustice of a war which sometimes trouble more</page><page sequence="5">362 J. A. FARRER.-Savage and civilized Warfare. advanced communities; nor would the terms of the following prayer to Loha Pennu before a war find so open an expression in the martial utterances of any Christian power:-" Let our axes," prays the Khond, " crush cloth and bones as the jaws of the hyoena crush its prey. Make the wounds we give to gape... When the wounds of our enemies heal, let lameness remain. Let their stones and arrows fall on us as softly as the flowers of the mowa-tree fall in the wind. . . Make their weapons brittle as the long pods of the karta-tree." This is of couirse all savage enough, but even the Khonds esteem peace above war, and conduct war under certain laws. As war is the god's concern, not theirs, so it is with peace; and the ceremonies are somewhat elaborate on either side when it is desired to know whether peace has become the command of the war-god. If it has, the joy of the peace dance which lasts three days, " is regarded as the very highest attainable on earth." Before a war begins, it is necessary, previous to an attack, to allow the enemy tinme to complete the same fetichistic ceremony as the offensive tribe performs itself. As their own priest goes to the enemy's land to cut from it a branch of a tree which is afterwards dressed in clothes and armo-ur to personate one of the hostile force, and thrown down at the shrine of the war-god in silent appeal for his co-operation in the coming struggle, so sufficient time must be allowed to the enemy for the perform- ance of a similar ceremoily. Even this c-ustom, elementary as it is as a law of war, in regulation and restraint of it, is an advance on the merely predatory mode of warfare, such as that in vogue among the Ahts, where no notice nor declaration of war is made, but one tribe falls on another with no more warning than would be considered obligatory by a pack of wolves. It is interesting to note the presence of such laws of war among the lower races, because it is generally assumed that they are only the product of an advanced civilization, only the glory of a so-called civilized warfare. The Caffies consider it shameful to attack their enemy, without a declaration of war, and when war has broken out they refrain from seeking to starve him out; they spare the lives of women and children, and restore them after the war. The Canarians, according to an old Spanish writer, " held it as base and mean to molest or injure the women and children of the enemy, considering them as weak and helpless, therefore improper objects of their resentment; neither did they throw down or damage houses of worship." IRespect towards the weaker sex in war is also asserted of the Winnebagoes andl of the Sioux Indians, and in Samoan warfare it is considered cowardly to kill a woman. But the case of the wild Abipones</page><page sequence="6">J. A. FARRER.-Savage and Civilized Warfare. 363 is perhaps the most remarkable in this respect, on account of the general savagery of their lives. Yet Dobritzhoffer assures us that not only did they think it unworthy of them to mangle the bodies of dead Spaniards, as other savages did, but that they generally spared the unwarlike, and carried away innocent boys and girls unhurt. The Spaniards, Indians, Negroes, and Mulattoes, he says, taken by them in war, they did not use like captives, but treated with kindness and indulgence, almost like children. Many displayed the tenderest compassion and con- fidence towards their prisoners, nor did Dobritzhoffer ever see a single captive so much as punished by a word or a blow. There are other instances in savage life of the recognition of certain laws of war. The Fijians who were addicted to torturing their prisoners would yet spare the fruit-trees of their enemy, unless his obduracy greatly prolonged the war. In olden Virginia it was customary before a war to send a message to the hostile force, to the effect that in the event of their defeat, all who submitted within two days should live. The Tongans held it as sacrilege to fight within the precincts of the burial places of their chiefs; and the greatest enemies must perforce meet there as friends, under penalty of being visited with pre- mature death. They also observed a curious custom, consequent on the obligation of everyone to fight on the side of that chief on whose island they might chance to be at the time when war was declared, by which a brief armistice was always allowed, to enable each party to take farewell of those friends and relations on the other side with whom they were so shortly to engage in deadly combat. The inviolability of ambassadors, the observance of treaties and truces, resort to mediation for peace, are far from being unknown in the warfare of races whose knowledge of strategy and tactics is of course not on a level with the European standard. It is, for example, through the mediation of a friendly tribe that the Khonds seek to obtain peace with their enemies. But proposals for peace are perhaps more commonly sent by ambassadors, who bear some recognised emblem of the nature of their mission-a whale's tooth in the Fiji Islands, a young plantain tree or a green branch of the ti plant in the Sandwich. All the tribes that Catlin visited in North America held a white flag of skin or bark as the inviolable symbol of a truce; and even the Shoshones of California, who kill their prisoners of war, especially women, with cruel tortures, observe the common Indian custom of ratifying the conclusion of hostilities by the pipe of peace. The greatest pains are often taken to impress the terms and the treaty of peace most vividly on the memory of the con-</page><page sequence="7">364 J. A. FARRER.-Savage and Civilized Warfare. tracting parties by striking and intelligible ceremonies. In the Fiji Islands hostilities were closed by a meeting of the two combatant forces, at which they threw down their arnms at one another's feet. On the Hervey Islands the breaking of a number of spears by the warrior chief against a large chestnut tree with great formality was the token of the cessation of war; the almost imperishable coral tree was planted in the valleys to signify the hope that as the tree was, so might the peace be; and after the drum of peace had been solemnlybeaten round the island, it was unlawful for any man to carry any weapon, or to cut down any iron-wood, which was capable of being turned into an instrument of destruction. The chief symbol of peace on the Sandwich Islands was a wreath, woven conjointly by the leading chiefs of either side, and placed in one of their temples. In a similar way the Tahitians made a wreath of green boughs, furnished by each side, and also made a band of cloth together, depositing both the band and the wreath in the temple, and invoking dire imprecations on the first side that should violate the peace and forget the reconciliation. It is of obvious practical importance to notice these traces among savages of moral restraints in the exercise of war. To a country that is never long without one of the so-called " little wars " on its hands, it is necessary to have some general ideas as to how far savage tribes are capable of any other restraint, save that of superior might, in political dealings with their neighbours; how far any sense of right or wrong is likely to enter into their consideration of the policy of a war on any given occasion; how far they are capable of understanding or of regarding the sanctity of covenants and treaties. It is said that the Indians of North America very honestly kept their treaties with the English, till they were taught by the French to adopt looser principles. And it is probable that the late Zulu war would never have occurred had it been possible for a Christian Commissioner to believe that a heathen nationi could do such a thing as keep its word, refraining from invasion or attack so long as it was not invaded or attacked itself, by reason of its confidence in the strict observation by either side of a solemn agreement made between itselt and its neighbour. War might have been averted had there not been a slowness to believe that overtures for a peace by a savage could be intended as auLght else than a military runse or could be expressed in any other language than the diplomatic forms of European warfare. The civilizing pretext, by which it is so often sought to lull the moral sensibilities of a country, suggests the interest which would attach to an inlquiry, how far similar wars have had</page><page sequence="8">J. A. FARRER.-Sava e and Civilized Warfaqre. 365 beneficial effects in the abolition of barbarous customs or in the engraftment of more refined manners on a conquered savage race. The Peruvians, who were constantly engaged in wars with savage tribes on their borders, before beginning their war would call upon their enemy not only to adopt the Religion of the Sun, but to put an end to their cannibalism, their human sacrifices, and their other vices. But it was not so much by force as by the contagion of example that they chiefly sought to spread civilization. Says Prescott of them: "They sought to soften the hearts of the rude tribes around them, and melt them by acts of condescension and kindness. Far from provoking hostili- ties, they allowed time for the salutary example of their own institutions to work its effect, trusting that their less civilized neighbours would submit to their sceptre, from a conviction of the blessings it would secure to them." They employed negotia- tion, conciliatory treatment, and presents to leading men among the tribes; and if all these failed, then they resorted to war, but to war which at every stage was readily open to propositions of peace, and in which any unnecessary outrage on the persons or property of their enemy was punished with death. It is undeni- able that culture has been promoted by war in many instances, though it is probable that peaceful efforts, those of missionaries, for example, have done as much or even more. Strabo says that the Bactrians had a custom of giving their fathers, if they out- lived their faculties, to their doos, and that Alexander the Great when he conquered them prohibited the practice. The grandest treaty of peace recorded in history was, Montesquieu thinks, that which Gelo, an ancient king of Syracuse, made with the Carthaginians. For when he had defeated 300,000 of them, he required of them, as a condition of peace, a condition which was of advantage chiefly or only to themselves-namely, that they should cease to sacrifice their children to their gods. But for the reason that it is easier to make such conditions than to secure their permanent observance, there can be no pretext for a war less satisfactory than zeal in print or peace-conditions for the improvement of humanity. Titles of honour, both in savage and civilized life, are among the favourite devices of the god of war for the maintenance of his worship. The king of France, says Montesquieu in one of his Persian Letters, has been known to carry on great wars with the help of no other fund than the sale of titles of honour. In like manner a Fijian would derive an honorary name from the club- bing to death in war of a human being of any age or sex, being entitled to call himself the Dog, Canoe, or Fort of any living chief of great renown; and warriors of rank esteemed it an honour to be generally knowln by their countrymen as the</page><page sequence="9">366 J. A. FARRER.-Savage and Civilized Warfare. " Waster " of such-and-such a coast, the " Divider " or " Devas- tator " of such-and-such a district. In North America the tribes had a most elaborate scale of honours, apportioning merit to the nicest distinctions of costume. Accordino to the mark on a warrior's robe, it was known at a glance whether he had slain a man or a womani, or whether his glory only rested on the slaughter of a girl or a boy. Among the Dacota tribes, certain marks on the coveted eagle's feather denoted the warrior's title to esteem. The feather with a red spot on it signified simply that the warrior had killed an enemy; a notch cut in it, and the edges painted red, showed that the enemy had had his throat cut; whilst according as the notches were on one side or on both sides, or the feather partly denuded, it was understood that the warrior had been the third, fourth, or fifth in order, to touch the dead body of a fallen foe. Of course in European warfare the slaughter is too indiscriminate for a man to claim such special distinctions. There is yet another point on which it would be of interest to have some statistics for correct comparison between savage and civilized warfare, and that is, concerning the relative destructive- ness and frequency of wars in the two conditions. As regards destructiveness, indeed, there can scarcely be any doubt when we recall the battle-fields of the Franco-German war, and then read of Fijian wars as havino sometimes been perfeetly blood- less. It is even probable that the frequency of war in the savage state has been much exaggerated. Bosirman cautions us, after a description of negro warfare, against thinking that negroes are always at war. The first reason by which he accounts for the fact, that the people of Fida, though able to bring into the field 200,000 men, would scarcely dare attack 5000 armed negroes, is that " they are so strongly bent to trade and agriculture, that they never think of war." Besides the Esquimaux, who do not know what war means, there are the Papuan Arafuras, who live " in peace and brotherly love with one another," and the Todas in India, who are entirely destitute of military organisation. Hobbes, it is well known, conceived that a state of war was the natural primitive state of mankind; but the counter-theory of Montesquieu is at least as likely, that a state of peace is really the most primitive, or, as he expresses it, the first natural law of society. And there is this advantage in the theory of the French philosopher: that it divests war of that species of sanctity which attaches to everything claiming to appertain to the laws of nature or the natural state. There is always a tendency to think of nature as of something older and better than convention, so that from Hobbes' theory that the state of nature is a state of war, it has come to be thought</page><page sequence="10">J. A. FAIuRER.-SaVqae and Civilized Warfare. 367 that a state of war is part of the unalterable conditions of exist- ence, a condition with which it were foolish, nay, even profane, to quarrel. Hobbes' theory once discredited, the false reverence now paid to war as a primaeval custom, as an instinct implanted in man at his creation, as one of the immutable laws of his being, will be paid to it no longer; and it will be regarded, as it only deserves to be regarded, as a purely optional misery, not, as it is so often spoken of, as a necessary evil. But whatever the primitive state of mankind may have been, or the condition of some existent tribes as regards peace and war, it is certain that if we take savagery as a whole, its most universal attribute, its most conspicuous fault, is not so much its ignorance, its superstition, or its cruelty, as its love for war, its lust of blood, its incapacity for peace; and it is also a fact that it is in warfare more than anything else that there is most in common between civilization and savagery, and that the distinction between them most nearly disappears. In religion, in morals, in art, the difference between savage and civilized communities is so great and wide that many men indignantly repudiate all thought of any connection or community of origin between them; but in war and all that relates to it, the points of analogy between the two are conspicuous, palpable, striking. There are the same notions of the glory of war, the same belief in it as the only source of national prestige and niational strength, the same hope from it of individual preferment, the same readiness to seize any pretext for resorting to it, the same foolish sentiment that it is mean to live without it. Even in its conduct the difference is rather one of weapons and tactics than of anything else; it has been shown that laws of war are not a monopoly of civilization, and it is possible that whatever advantage the latter has in this respect is compensated to some extent in savage life by the less frequent occurrence, and the less fatal character of their wars. For it is probable that their frequency has been much exaggerated, in order to enhance men's notions of the miseries of the heathen state. A last question then remains. Civilization, ever advancing, has shaken off many of the superstitions, many of the cruielties, and much of the ignorance that it inherited from the times and thoughts of savagery; is there any reasonable ground for hope that it will ever shake off that which most clearly betrays the taint of its origin, that which is its strongest surviving link with barbarism, that which it acknowledges to be its highest re- proach, and that which it would be its highest glory to put aside-namely, its pursuit and lust of war? The opinion is already spreading fast that war, as a mode of settling disputes, is silly and savage; and the opinion only</page><page sequence="11">368 Discussion. needs to spread further for war between civilized nations to become a moral impossibility, irrespective of any international Treaty of Disarmament. Such a treaty, when it comes, will be but the seal of a change of custom preceded and prepared by a change of opinion. All that is wanted is a certain amount of human opinion and human will-of opinion, that quarrels may and should be settled peaceably; of will, that they shall be settled in no other way. Not more will is required than suffhced to put down the slave trade; nor is any stronger opinion needed than was enough for the extinction of duelling and torture. No exorbitant demands are made upon human nature as it is, no excessive claims upon our energies and in- telligence. It is only by exaggerations of the difficulties, the usual refuge of apathy or ignorance, that the advent of an era of peace is any longer delayed. For wars to cease, it is only necessary that their cessation should be thought in earnest possible and desirable; and the arbitrament of the sword will no longer be thought of, when once another mode of arbitrament is honestly preferred. Till it is, no fundamental difference between savagery and civilization can be said to exist. DISCUSSION. The PRESIDENT said that while the weapons and methods of warfare had been carefully studied by Anthropologists, the present author regarded war from the point of view of ethics and politics. This subject, though treated of in modern works on arithropology, had perhaps not previously beeni brought before the Institute. The author of the paper had contributed to the problem interesting information, showing that even among very rude tribes war was not mere fighting without rule or restraint, but that on the contrary the practice of declarations of war was general, and other restrictions appeared which showed that the object sought was not merelv for one tribe to injure another as much as possible, but to decide a quarrel by ordeal of war. The collection of facts as to the effect of military organisation on society was perhaps more complete than had been previously made. Mr. SHUTE said he did not think that it was in times of primitive savagery that the methods of warfare were most free from con- ventional restrictions. It was rather when civilization of a sort had dissolved back into barbarism that the warrior felt himself emancipated from all scruples of the conventional conscience. He noticed that not only a solemn declaration of war, but even a short pause after the declaration and before the commencement of hostilities, was part of the conventional morality of some of the primitive Italian tribes. He could not believe much in arbitration as a method of solving pure international questions, but he thought that more wa's to be hoped from the fact that those who actually carried on the</page><page sequence="12">INSCRIPTION ON (~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \A I 930H A ' t Z} 409,'S'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~j, Asukh Ashteka, Ashibna (KOi1jsa) (To adore, to contemplate) (We restored) Dibash Dudin Dashut Di Dah Diken (orney) (Baskets) (alhsing) (Of) (This) (This Calah Kidnah, Kodnu Kedtun Cohen Cab .,Cons-ummat~on, F-uneral ( Sueb as whem, amnule, when) P-riest ) ( Grieving') Narun Narun Sacar Sakh-q-u A City ) (A City) (Wages) (Play ye) (Car J.P.Emsl i e, del.</page><page sequence="13">INSCRIPTION ON DOOR-POSTS FROM IAREBIZ (CARCHEMISH ) DICTIONARY Ashibna Aur Asunik Ak,OQg Hyk Bulim (Werestored) (Flame) (Thyinju ) (Chief) kGods3 Dah Diken Xhinamn Xhibal Khapash orKhapas Khadash gThis) (This r a) (IBestroyed ) (Setfree, exsxnmed) (Made3ew Cab Mesuk Minneh I{eginvati (Grieving) (Mixed wine with spice) (Whence.

It would hardly be worth the while of the average citizen of central Germany to spend his blood and treasure in order that the burghers of Mulhause should send a representative to Berlin instead of to Paris. Mr. WORTHINGTON G. SMITH, F.L.S., exhibited a series of 60 palaeolithic implernents, principally from the Valley of the Axe. Some of the specimens were unusually large and heavy, one broken implement (a butt-end) weighing more than 2- lbs. The Axe Valley implements were all made of chert, many presenting a large mass of the old crust of the chert on the butt; this crust so readily absorbs moisture, that after a short immersion in water some of the imple- mnents become nearly an ounce heavier in weight. Mr. SMITH also exhibited a fourth series of palseolithic implements of flint, found in the Valley of the Thames at and near London. This exhibition brought the number of Thames implements found by Air. Smith up to 43, exclusive of 12 large flakes trimmed to an implement-like form. The PRESIDENT said that living at the foot of the Black- down Hills, he had looked over great quantities of chert fragments, but without finding any implements. For the rude and heavy palseolithic type of instruments, the specimens now exhibited showed the local chert to be a tolerable material, though quite unsuited to the finer flakes and arrow-heads of the neolithic age.</page></plain_text>
