<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Illuminated Medieval Passover Haggadah: Investigations and Research Problems by Joseph Gutmann, Cincinnati A. Investigations to Date When David Heinrich M?ller, the orientalist, and Julius von Schlosser, the art historian, collaborated in publishing Die Haggadah von Sarajevo in 1898, they could justly claim that "they had broken ground in an un cultivated area of research."1 Prior to their pioneering efforts, only a few sporadic, isolated notices and articles had appeared on the subject of the illuminated Passover haggadah.2 In their book, M?ller and Schlosser dated and discussed in detail the miniatures appearing in the Sarajevo Haggadah and in three other Sephardic haggadot. Including, in addition, brief descriptions of miniatures in five other Sephardic haggadot from the British Museum, they went on to offer a discussion of six Ashkenazic haggadot with their cycles of illuminations. Schlosser, in a chapter entitled "Der Bilderschmuck der Haggadah," supplied a short survey of what appeared to him to be the stylistic and icono graphie features of the Spanish and German Passover haggadot. Rabbi David Kaufmann, in a supplementary chapter ? "Zur Geschichte der j?dischen Handschriftenillustration" ? attempted a first survey of the different types of extant illuminated Hebrew manuscripts, and also referred briefly to the illuminated haggadah manuscripts. He lamented the fact that catalogs of Hebrew books and books on art history generally ignored the subject of Hebrew miniatures on the assumption that, since "Jews were not supposed to have images, therefore none existed."3 In a review published in 1900, the well-known art historian Adolph Goldschmidt4 questioned the dating of some of the manuscripts treated by the editors of the Sarajevo Haggadah, while Rachel Wischnitzer,5 in 1922, discussed some of the iconographie and stylistic relationships of the British Museum's five Sephardic haggadot, to which M?ller and Schlosser had only briefly alluded in their book. The second major work devoted to the illuminated Passover haggadah was a two volume publication which appeared in 1927, and was entitled Die Darmst?dter Pessach Haggadah.6 For the first time, a medieval haggadah was reproduced in its entirety in a magnificent color facsimile edition. Whereas M?ller and Schlosser had focused their attention essentially on the miniatures in haggadot, Bruno Italiener now devoted many pages to the textual problems of the haggadah in the accompanying Textband, to which he added, as an appendix, a list of eighty-six illuminated haggadot extant in libraries 3</page><page sequence="2">4 Studies in Bibliography and Booklore, 1965 throughout the world. The Textband also contained a description by Aron Freimann of the pal?ographie aspects of the Darmstadt Haggadah, as well as Adolf Schmidt's review of the haggadah's history. Italiener, in the work's first chapter, dealt with many iconographie characteristics of the Sephardic and Ashkenazic haggadot. In the third chapter, he described the illuminations of twenty haggadot, most of which had not been treated in the Sarajevo book. August Mayer's stylistic comments on the Darmstadt Haggadah and on other illu minated haggadah manuscripts threw new light on Hebrew miniatures in the haggadah. Alexander Marx, in an article published in 1928,7 criticized both the textual material and the dating of the Darmstadt Haggadah and of some of the other haggadot considered by Italiener. In addition, he corrected and contributed significantly to the list of illuminated haggadot which Italiener had appended to the end of the Darmstadt Haggadah volume. Marx's suggestion that the scribe of the Darmstadt Haggadah, Israel ben Meir, and the scribe of the so-called First Cincinnati Haggadah, Meir ben Israel Jaffe, were father and son, was explored in 1940 in a detailed stylistic and iconographie study of the two manu scripts by Franz Landsberger.8 Landsberger concluded that the scribes were not only father and son, but that they were the illuminators of the haggadot as well. A hitherto overlooked Ph.D. thesis written in 1932 by Paul K?ser, a pupil of the famous art historian Josef Strzygowski, is devoted to a study of the so-called First Nuremberg Haggadah.9 The author's conclusion that the motifs in this haggadah can be traced to West-Asiatic and Iranian prototypes, transmitted to the West by Oriental Jewish mer chants via designs on textiles and metal objects, follows the racial theories of art taught by Strzygowski at the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Vienna. The basis of K?ser's conclusion rests on Strzygowski's predication of an assumed influence which Iran exerted on the arts of other areas. The haggadah discussed by K?ser had been written by a scribe, Joel ben Simeon, who also wrote several other haggadot. The appearance of the same name and of certain super ficial stylistic similarities in the First Nuremberg Haggadah and in three other haggadot led Michael Fooner, in an article published in 1937,10 to conclude that Joel ben Simeon was also the illuminator of these four manuscripts. Landsberger, in a later article,11 recon sidered the evidence presented by Fooner and analyzed an additional haggadah written by a Joel ben Simeon. Rejecting Fooner's contention that one artist had illuminated the four haggadah manuscripts, Landsberger felt that the five manuscripts in question were done by three different artists, each called Joel ben Simeon, who were undoubtedly related. The Kaufmann Haggadah, which had been described earlier in the M?ller-Schlosser volume, was issued in 1957 in a color facsimile edition.12 The short introduction by Alexan der Scheiber adds previously unpublished iconographie and stylistic details of this manu script. Articles on the John Rylands Spanish Haggadah13 by Cecil Roth and Helen Rosenau offer significant observations concerning this haggadah and Spanish haggadot related to it. Most welcome is the color facsimile edition of the previously published and well-known Sarajevo Haggadah.14 This new edition of the Sarajevo Haggadah is enhanced by Cecil</page><page sequence="3">The Illuminated Medieval Passover Haggadah: Investigations and Research Problems 5 Roth's concise introduction, giving hitherto unknown information on the history of the manuscript, its style and iconography. An unpublished Ph.D. thesis, completed in 1961 by Mendel Metzger, entitled "La Haggada Enlumin?e," represents a most ambitious undertaking.15 Metzger has examined forty-five illuminated haggadah manuscripts, some entirely unknown and others never before dealt with adequately. His detailed iconographie study analyzes, compares, and describes all the ceremonial, textual and biblical images appearing in these haggadot. In the course of his thesis, he has made new observations and has corrected many details in the descriptions of miniatures made by previous authors. A short stylistic section ana lyzing the manuscripts discussed is appended to the comprehensive iconographie studies. Whereas Metzger tried to cover the entire field of medieval illuminations in haggadah manuscripts, another unpublished Ph.D. thesis, written in 1963 by Bezalel Narkiss, con centrates essentially on one important Spanish haggadah, the British Museum manuscript, Add. 27210.16 Narkiss gives a history and a textual analysis of this haggadah and a descrip tion of its miniatures. His stylistic comparisons lead him to conclude that the miniatures in the British Museum haggadah were done in Catalonia, Spain, around 1320 by two artists trained in the North French tradition (fig. 1). While Metzger's thesis concentrated on an iconographie analysis of miniatures in the Passover haggadah manuscripts themselves, Narkiss interests himself primarily in isolating the iconographie sources which may have served as models for the biblical cycle in the Spanish haggadah, British Museum, Add. 27210. He demonstrates that the immediate models for the biblical pictures were primarily French biblical cycles, though some contact with Italian and Spanish sources is indicated. Some of the biblical iconography, however, he suggests, shows a direct relation to early Christian, mid-Byzantine and possibly even late antique Jewish illuminated manuscript cycles. B. Research Problems i . Origin of the Illuminated Passover Haggadah. Recent scholarly research has established that no illuminated Passover haggadah can, with any degree of certainty, be dated earlier than the fourteenth century. These early illuminated haggadah manuscripts, it is generally agreed, come from Spain. Moreover, scholars have recognized that the cycle of biblical illuminations, which usually precedes the text proper in the Spanish haggadah, bears some relation to a similar practice found in Christian manuscripts, especially in the more splendid psalters of thirteenth century France.17 What has thus far not been treated with adequacy is why the practice arose ? perhaps in late thirteenth-century Western Europe ? of having the haggadah illuminated and of having it serve as a separate, private book. Prior to the fourteenth century, the haggadah was generally a part of the prayer codices and was apparently not illuminated ? except for some crude stylized sketches of the maror leaf and the matzah, which appear in Cairo Genizah fragments of a haggadah, possibly dating from the tenth century.18 Deserving of further study is the interconnection that may exist between the</page><page sequence="4">6 Studies in Bibliography and Booklore, 196$ need for and subsequent production of private books like the psalter and breviary for Christians in thirteenth-century Europe and a similar need for and subsequent production of private books like the haggadah for Jews.19 2. Style. Although very few illuminated Passover haggadot have been systematically studied from the point of view of style, such an analysis is extremely important in order to determine the date and region of origin of individual manuscripts and to show their stylistic relationship to contemporary Christian manuscripts.20 Studies of this nature will also shed light on whether such closely related manuscripts as the German Second Nurem berg and Yahuda Haggadot, or the Spanish haggadot, John Rylands Library, Hebr. Ms. 6, and British Museum Ms, Or. 1404, were produced by the same workshops or artists, or whether they are direct copies of each other, or merely dependent on common, lost archetypes. Stylistic study of the illuminated Passover haggadah was greatly hampered until recently by the lack of a central photographic archives of all miniatures21 ? and, further, by the fact that very few of the haggadah manuscripts are dated. Other difficulties involved in the stylistic study of the Passover haggadot are that they sometimes employ, in addition to contemporary influences, earlier stylistic modes. In Spain, for instance, fourteenth-century haggadah manuscripts betray not only the same influences of the French Gothic, Italian and Mudejar styles which are reflected in contemporary non-Jewish Spanish manuscripts, but also, in such manuscripts as British Museum, Or. 2737, Mozarabic decorative forms and color schemes.32 Zoomorphic and anthropomorphic lettering, familiar from the earlier Mozarabic art, is found in several other illuminated Spanish haggadot.23 Similarly, Ashkenazic haggadot of the fifteenth century show the same influences of the International style and the styles of the Netherlands and Italy that are evident in contem porary German and Italian manuscripts. They also manifest the impact of the new graphic arts. Once again, however, stylistic analysis is complicated by the fact that some manu scripts ? the Second Nuremberg and Yahuda Haggadot, for instance ? preserve Gothic and Romanesque architectural and decorative forms. 3. Haggadah Illuminators. Little is known about the artists who produced these haggadah manuscripts. Some of them may have been Jewish, others Christian. In the case of the Spanish Sarajevo Haggadah, the anonymous artist was undoubtedly a Jew. His miniatures run from right to left, following the direction of the Hebrew script; he has an intimate acquaintance with Jewish life and tradition; and images of the Deity are scrupulously avoided, so that a man resting on the Sabbath replaces the usual Christian depiction of the Deity resting on the seventh day, and the angels are represented as ascending and descending the ladder in Jacob's dream with their faces hidden by their wings.24 Franz Landsberger tried to establish that, in fifteenth-century Germany and North Italy, certain scribes of the Passover haggadot were also their illuminators. From fifteenth century Germany, he identified Israel ben Meir as both scribe and illuminator of the Darm</page><page sequence="5">The Illuminated Medieval Passover Haggadah: Investigations and Research Problems Stadt Haggadah, although the sylistic evidence in support of this thesis is not convincing. Landsberger further contended, however, that Meir ben Israel Jaffe (ns* btnw '12 tkd) was the illuminator as well as the scribe of the First Cincinnati Haggadah ? an assumption that may indeed be correct, since Meir ben Israel Jaffe enjoyed an outstanding reputation as an expert leather tooler.25 From fifteenth-century Germany and North Italy, Landsberger attributed five haggadah manuscripts, bearing the name of the scribe Joel ben Simeon (pyDP 'm bxv), to three different artists who were, he claimed, related to each other.26 These five haggadah manu scripts, plus two additional manuscripts bearing the same scribe's name, which have come to light since Landsberger's work on the subject was published, present many puzzling difficulties. If we examine closely the five haggadot mentioned by Landsberger as well as British Museum, Ms. Add. 26957a7 and tne Dyson Perrins Haggadah,28 we find that the colophons vary. In the First Nuremberg Haggadah and the First New York Haggadah, the colophon reads: Joel ben R. Simeon, the scribe (nsio); the Washington Haggadah colophon reads: Joel ben Simeon, the scribe (is?d); the British Museum, Ms. Add. 26957: Joel ben R. Simeon, the scribe (nbnb); the Second New York Haggadah: Joel ben R. Simeon, called Feibush Ashkenazi ('UDPK from Cologne, the scribe (ibnb) and designer or artist (t'x); the Dyson Perrins Haggadah: Joel ben R. Simeon, called Feibush Ashkenazi from Cologne, the scribe ( ? ), and the British Museum, Add. 14762: Joel called Feibush, the designer (t*2ff). In four manuscripts, therefore, he is Joel ben Simeon or Joel ben R. Simeon, the scribe (ibzb or nsio). In three manuscripts, he is Joel or Joel ben R. Simeon, called Feibush, the scribe (ibzb or isid), and in only two manuscripts is he also designated the designer or artist ( **). The styles and iconography in all the manuscripts differ so greatly that it is difficult to discover stylistic and iconographie similarities between one manuscript and another, and Landsberger's demonstrations that stylistic links do in fact exist are un convincing. Only the Dyson Perrins Haggadah, the Second New York Haggadah, and the Washington Haggadah evince some similarities. Even the two manuscripts, the Second New York Haggadah and the British Museum, Add. 14762, where the scribe calls himself the designer or artist ( ^), lack obvious stylistic relationships; only the decorative letter ing shows some parallels. It may, therefore, be tentatively suggested? subject, of course, to a thorough stylistic and pal?ographie study ? that the illustrations in the manuscripts bearing the various names of Joel ben R. Simeon were not necessarily done by the scribes, and that the scribe, in using the word in two manuscripts, may merely have meant to identify himself as the designer of the artistic lettering in these two manuscripts.29 4. Iconography. Studies have revealed that the Sephardic haggadah often has full-page biblical illuminations preceding the text proper30 ? by contrast with the Ashkenazic haggadah, which, if it contains a biblical cycle at all, incorporates it within the body of the text in the form of marginal illustrations, as we find in the Second Nuremberg and Yahuda Haggadot.</page><page sequence="6">8 Studies in Bibliography and Booklore, 196$ The Ashkenazic haggadah lays greater stress than the Sephardic haggadah on depicting the ceremonies described in the haggadah and on the preparations for the Passover itself ? the taking of the flour to the mill, the making of dough, the decoration and baking of the matzot and the search for and removal of the leaven. Considerable emphasis is also put on illustrating the literary and biblical allusions in the text of the haggadah. Some of the biblical cycles, particularly those in the Sephardic haggadah manuscripts, accord lavish treatment to the Book of Exodus and illustrate such scenes from it as the discovery of the infant Moses by the princess, the forced labor demanded of the Hebrews in building the Egyptian cities of Pithom and Raamses, the ten plagues, and the exodus from Egypt. In certain haggadot, the Book of Genesis is also strongly featured, with scenes depicting the lives of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and especially Joseph (fig. 1). Some Sephardic haggadah manuscripts, such as the Sarajevo Haggadah, begin the biblical cycle with the creation of the world and end with scenes from the books of Numbers and Deuteronomy. Ashkenazic haggadah manuscripts, such as the Second Nuremberg and Yahuda Haggadot, also include scenes from the books of Joshua, Judges, I Samuel, I Kings, Jonah, and the Prophets; many of these scenes, of course, allude as well to the poetic insertions, or piyyutim,*1 in the haggadah. Further study of the iconography of the Passover haggadah illustrations is required if we are to determine whether local or regional variations existed in the iconography chosen in the territories of Germany and Spain. In addition, the iconographie differences in Italian and German haggadot have not been sufficiently probed, nor has ample consideration been given the question of the possible influence of the Sephardic haggadah illuminations on those in the Ashkenazic haggadah. Several haggadah manuscripts present unique iconographie problems. The so-called Birdhead Haggadah in the Bezalel National Museum, Jerusalem, depicts many human beings with bird heads. This practice of placing animal heads on human beings seems to have been commonly employed, especially in German mahzorim and Bibles from the late thirteenth to fourteenth centuries.32 One theory proffered in explanation is that all of the human beings depicted with animal heads are symbolic of elevation above the human and represent godly grace.33 This theory is refuted, however, by the fact that some manu scripts portray not only righteous people, but wicked persons as well ? Haman and his sons, for instance ? with animal heads.34 The problem is one that demands more investigation. Another manuscript in need of separate study is the famous Darmstadt Haggadah, whose scenes, unlike those found in other haggadah manuscripts, are difficult to relate to the text and the seder ceremonies.35 Although it is generally realized that the biblical illuminations, especially in the Spanish haggadah, are dependent on contemporary Christian prototypes, investigations of the extent of iconographie dependence of Jewish on Christian models as well as of the complex problem of whether a uniquely Jewish iconography exists, are still in their infancy.36</page><page sequence="7">LOCATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF HAGGADAH 1.

For instance, the British Museum fourteenth-century haggadah, Ms. Or. 2884, fol. ov, as well as the seventh century Tours Pentateuch in the Biblioth?que Nationale, Paris, nouv. acq. lat. 2334, fol. 44r, and the eleventh-century Octateuch in the Vatican Library, gr. 747, fol. 63V, contain depictions of Benjamin sitting next to his brother Joseph at the meal they ate together in Egypt. This seating arrangement is not in accord with the description in Genesis 43:32, which says that three separate places were set ? one for Joseph by himself, one for all of the brothers, and one for the Egyptians ? but it is in keeping with midrashic tradition.37 Similarly, the "man" (bpk) whom Joseph encounters at Shechem (Genesis 37:15), is depicted in two haggadah manuscripts of the fourteenth century (British Museum, Mss. Add. 27210, fol. 5r and Or. 2884, fol. jr), as well as in early Christian art, as an angel ? in keeping with the midrashic accounts which identify him as the angel Gabriel38 (fig. 1). The appearance of these midrashic illustrations in fourteenth-century haggadot and in early Christian art calls forth a host of complex and interesting questions : . Did the artists who illuminated the haggadah miniatures have direct access to early Christian manuscripts, or did they use contemporary Christian manuscripts, now lost, which retained the early models? 2. Since it is now assumed by some scholars that the biblical cycles in early Christian manuscripts, such as the Tours Pentateuch, the Vienna Genesis, and the Octateuchs,39 are based on lost illuminated Hebrew manuscripts, is it possible that the haggadah artists had access to these lost archetypes and copied miniatures from them? These problems lend themselves to no easy solutions. Our knowledge of the development of early Christian biblical illuminations is still very limited, largely because the earliest preserved Christian biblical manuscripts date from the sixth century. Other artistic evi dence from the early Christian period is too fragmentary, and from the later period too inconclusive, to permit final judgments. While it would be tempting to link early Jewish art with medieval Jewish art, we cannot at this stage of investigation indulge in such learned speculations. The earliest preserved biblical paintings in the Jewish realm date from about 245 C. E. and come from the syna gogue of Dura-Europos in Syria. There is a gap of almost 1000 years before biblical illustra tions reappear, this time in a late Romanesque Hebrew manuscript, dated 1233, from W?rzburg, Germany.40 The problem is further complicated, since the biblical cycles in many of the Spanish haggadot, far from showing dependence on a common prototype, reflect a variety of sources. Again, the assumed existence of illuminated Hebrew manuscripts in antiquity rests, at this stage of research, mainly on the appearance of aggadic and midrashic illustrations in early Christian manuscripts, as there is no known evidence in literary sources attesting to their existence.41</page><page sequence="16">18 Studies in Bibliography and Booklore, 196$ What has not been adequately considered in researches dealing with the problem of early illuminated Hebrew manuscripts is the fact that in the early Christian period personal relations between the Fathers of the Church and the scholars of the Synagogue often pro vided a medium for the diffusion of many Jewish legends found in later Christian writings and illustrations. From the twelfth century on, there is, in fact, written evidence of the direct use of rabbinic literature by Christian scholars.43 This may account for the appearance in fourteenth-century Western Christian manuscripts of illustrations of such Jewish legends as Abraham being cast into and delivered from the fire and the test of Moses by hot coals.43 Since these aggadic themes are not found in Jewish art prior to the fourteenth century,44 and are not known in early Christian art, they may very well have been invented during the Middle Ages and may, therefore, have no relation to lost early Christian or Hebrew models. 5. Jewish Customs and Ceremonies. Although scholars have been aware that the customs and ceremonies illustrated in the Passover haggadah give vivid testimony to the diversity in practice among Sephardim and Ashkenazim in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Europe, little study has been devoted to them. These depictions allow us to compare some customs still retained by the descendants of the respective Jewries, and to recapture others that have been abandoned. One example of a Sephardic Passover custom illustrated in a few Spanish haggadah manuscripts ? and still adhered to in some Sephardic communities ? is the practice of public distribution of the haroset and matzot.AS An example of a Sephardic custom illustrated in a fourteenth-century Spanish haggadah (British Museum, Or. 2884, folio 17V) ? and no longer followed ? is the practice of reciting the haggadah in the synagogue on Passover for the benefit of those who were unskilled in reciting it. In our miniature, the reader stands on the raised tevah (bimah), placed in the center of the Spanish synagogue, and recites from the haggadah before him. Below him is a group of men, women and a child46 (fig. 2). In the Ashkenazic haggadah, we often find illustrations of the head of the household, who holds a cup in his left hand, curving the fingers of his right hand inward toward the palm as he raises this hand toward the flames of the so-called Judenstern, an oil-burning, star-shaped Sabbath lamp. These depictions reflect the prevalent custom of holding the right hand up to the light to look at the fingernails when reciting the blessing over light at the havdalah ceremony, performed at the outgoing of the Sabbath47 (fig. 3). Another custom which arose in medieval Germany and is frequently illustrated in fif teenth-century Ashkenazic haggadot is the opening of the door for the long-awaited prophet Elijah and the Messiah when reciting the passage in the haggadah beginning, "Pour out your wrath" (Psalm 79:6). One late-fifteenth-century Ashkenazic haggadah, known as the Washington Haggadah (in Washington, D. C, Library of Congress, folio 19V), shows a man standing at an open door, holding a cup of wine. An old man with a white beard approaches upon the messianic ass. Seated behind him on the ass are a man and a boy,</page><page sequence="17">The Illuminated Medieval Passover Haggadah: Investigations and Research Problems 19 while a woman and a girl ride upon the ass' tail, to which another small child clings. This depiction seems to follow an account given by Rabbi Joseph Yuspa Hahn of prevailing practices in sixteenth-century Frankfurt-am-Main. Hahn recounts that the head of the house grasped the fourth cup of wine, opened the door, as in our miniature, and recited the passage from Psalms in honor of the awaited Messiah48 (fig. 4). The rich source material, briefly indicated above, which the illuminated haggadah manuscripts provide in graphically depicting various medieval Jewish customs and cere monies, still awaits a thorough study. 6. The Historic Dimension. The possibility of utilizing the art in the Passover haggadah as a prime source for the reconstruction of Jewish history has been barely realized. Attention should be given the relationship between the production of luxurious codices like the haggadah and the flourishing of a Jewish aristocratic class in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Christian Spain. Similarly, the particular scenes chosen for illustration in haggadot from fifteenth-century Germany ? those, for example, depicting Pharaoh bathing in the blood of innocent Jewish children, or those exemplifying the hope of redemp tion by showing the arrival of the Messiah at the seder*9 ? should be examined with a view to assessing the extent to which they may have been influenced by the brutalities visited on Jews in the declining medieval system of fifteenth-century Germany. The parallelism between the costly haggadah codices produced for Spanish Jewish nobles and equally sumptuous codices prepared for the Christian nobles of Spain has been noticed. The interconnection, however, between the unpretentious, lively folk character of the colored marginal illustrations in fifteenth-century German haggadot like the Second Nuremberg and Yahuda Haggadot, and the illustrations in secular and religious Christian literature produced during that period, especially for the wealthy burgher classes in the cities, needs further examination. For instance, in German haggadah manuscripts, at the point in the seder when the display of bitter herbs is called for, we sometimes find a man humorously pointing to his wife, in allusion to the verse in Ecclesiastes 7:26, that a bad woman "is more bitter than death''50 (fig. 5). To accompany the words in the Passover haggadah text, "you open [the conversation] for him," in reference to the fourth child who is unable to ask the prescribed questions, we find at times a literal representation of an adult who pries open the incompetent son's mouth with his hands.51 Next to the text, "in every generation one must look upon himself as if he personally had come forth from Egypt," artists in the Ashkenazic haggadot sometimes literally depicted a man "looking at himself" in a mirror52 (fig. 5). This folk humor and naive literalness revealed in the haggadah illustrations reflect a practice that is common in contemporary Christian manuscripts. Similarly, the rhymed verses that accompany the haggadah illustra tions follow a fashion current also in Christian manuscripts.53 Furthermore, the wine spattered Ashkenazic haggadot that have come down to us from fifteenth-century Germany, with their unsophisticated folk drawings, testify that they, like their contemporary Christian counterparts, were not intended as much to be displayed as to be read and used.54</page><page sequence="18">20 Studies in Bibliography and Booklore, 196$ This paper has attempted to summarize investigations on the illuminated medieval Passover haggadah and to point out the many fascinating problems that still await research and beg for solution.

Add. 27210, folio 3 ; Or. 2884, folio 3r and Add. 14761, folio 36V). It appears also in an Ashkenazic mahzor from fourteenth-century Ger many (Leipzig, Karl-Marx Universit?tsbibliothek, Cod. 1102/11, folio 104V). Whereas in the Sephardic haggadot, an angel or angels rescue Abraham, the mahzor miniature perhaps shows God intervening, indicated by a hand which reaches toward Abraham from heaven. Jewish legends recount that Abraham was saved by both God himself (Targum Ps. Jonathan 15:7; Pesaljim 118a), as well as by an angel (Genesis Rabbah 44:13)?

Finesinger, "The Custom of Looking at the Fingernails at the Outgoing of the Sabbath," HUCA, xii-xiii (1937-38), 347-65. 48 Sej"er Yosif Ometz (Frankfurt am Main, 1928), no. 788 (p. 172). It appears that the conjecture of some scholars that the figure riding on the ass, in haggadah miniatures, is Elijah, is not borne out by the evidence. Cf., for instance, Landsberger, "Washington Haggadah," pp. 77-78 and Wisch nitzer, "Passover in Art," p. 307. The First New York Haggadah, fol. 14V shows a figure riding on an ass and blowing a shofar. The accom panying inscription reads Messiah (nwn). Cod. Hebr. 37, fol. 35V in the Hamburg Staats- und Universit?tsbibliothek also shows a crowned figure riding upon an ass and blowing a shofar, but the accompanying inscriptions likewise refer to the Messiah's coming (Italiener, op. cit., p. 189). The ass and crown are symbolic of the Messiah, while the shofar is customarily associated with Elijah, who will use it to announce the Messiah's coming. Apparently the figures of Elijah and the Messiah are here combined in one person. The inscription accompanying the figure on an ass in the Second Nuremberg Haggadah, fol. 29V actually refers to welcoming both Elijah and the Messiah (M?ller, op. cit., p. 158). Cf. Metzger, op. cit., pp. 668-80 for a discus sion of other miniatures on this theme. 49 Gutmann, "Haggadic Motif," pp. 20*-2i* and supra, note 48. 5? M. Metzger, "A propos de l'illustration de mar?r z?
