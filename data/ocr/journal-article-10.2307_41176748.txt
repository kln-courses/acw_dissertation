<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Symposium IV: Adequacy of Knowledge and Christian Intelligence Charles E. Sheedy * * H he idea of the symposium seems to be to discuss from several differ- r ent and perhaps divergent viewpoints an aspect of a problem which is engaging much thought and writing in these times. It may be described generally as the problem of freedom and order (or if you like to see a dilemma, the problem of freedom versus order). It is not at all a problem of words. It has behind it the institutional and social history of the last four hundred years at least. The pendulum of social action is said to swing gradually back and forth, so that one or the other of these values enjoys a favorable position from time to time, while the other falls into the shade. Thus feudalism is sometimes said to have been good for order and bad for freedom, and liberalism the other way around. The social climate, the "spirit of the age", with all of its multitudinous relevant and irrelevant factors, is said to preside over this gradual shifting back and forth of ascendancy. We think that emergency is a factor: when the people must be rallied, freedom tends to be swallowed up. We saw this in the war, and in the "war of the peace" that followed the war. It is undoubtedly the part of wise statesmanship in every institution to support both values, to make exclusive option of neither. This is one area in which the "either/or" of Kierkegaard must be inoperative. We have seen in our own times the option for order disastrously made by Hitler and Mussolini and by the rulers of Soviet Russia. Maybe the single most urgent social problem of our day is to preserve our freedom in the midst of a continuing and quasi-permanent emergency. The discussion of the "Christian college" seems far removed from these vast political and economic considerations. But basically the problem is all of one piece, and the educational discussion may be more significant than it looks because through it the minds of young people are influenced more than they are through the wider considerations. At any rate the educational discussion is lively and has provoked much expres- sion from all sides. At least ten years ago, a symposium on "The Democratic Spirit and Scientific Faith" was held at Columbia, and the "authoritarianism" of Catholic education was soundly whacked in one paper after the other. A counter- part to this, under Catholic auspices, was in a symposium on "Secularism", edited by Mr. Ross Hoffman, and having such contributors as Dr. Gerald B. Phelan and Father Francis Connell. The debate over religion in the schools, with its constitu- tional and juridical implications, gave impetus to the discussion; and in this con- nection we think of the article of Professor Corwin in "Thought" and of the book by Dr. Henry P. Van Dusen, God in Education, In my opinion, of course, the proponents of Christianity in education have had Charles E. Sheedy, С S.

Father Leo Ward, in Blueprint for a Catholic University, has written frankly of the deficiencies of the Catholic higher learning, as well as of its values and objectives. And Professor Maritain has dis- cussed the problem with his accustomed purity of thought and nobility of expres- sion in Education at the Crossroads. Mr. Christopher Dawson has written many books and articles on Christian culture, and Professor Dietrich von Hildebrand has written concerning a point which is emphasized in this paper. Undoubtedly the most influential expression of the Christian viewpoint has been that of Sir Walter Moberly in his Crisis in the University. In this book Sir Walter effectively exposed the neutralist fiction by pointing out that if you exclude religion and theology from the schools you thereby teach that nothing can be known about God, or at least that what can be known does not matter very much. Among Protestant writers, President Howard Lowry of Wooster, Dr. Van Dusen, and Dr. Arnold S. Nash have written with eloquence and force. At the same time, I think it is not too unfair to say that the most influential expression of the secularist view- point is to be found in the writings of Mr. Paul Blanshard. A great experience for me during the years 1951-1952 was that of participat- ing in the research project "What is a Christian College ?" which was sponsored by the National Council of Churches and directed by Dr. Raymond F. McLain. Some three hundred "Christian" or "church-related" colleges, Catholic and Protestant, took part in many discussions in many parts of the country. I suspect that the present symposium is closely related to this research project. During those discussions on the Christian college, the word of all words most frequently used (I thought) was "commitment", and I imagine that the ideas con- nected with that word will bring us to the center of the problem. It is presumed that a "Christian college" makes some sort of "commitment" - to a "point of view", a "faith". Does this "commitment" mean that some sort of order is necessarily imposed on the teachers and learners in the college? Is this so to such an extent that the function of inquiry which the college professes is necessarily changed to a process of compulsory verification of positions anteriorly held on "faith"? And again, does "commitment" vitiate the teaching function of the college, by substitut- ing for it indoctrination in the approved and "official" position of the college ? II. I see my job in the symposium as one of attempting to tackle these questions - and their implications - as a "responsible Roman Catholic-Christian educator", "from the standpoint of a Thomistic interpretation of truth and revelation," de- veloping the "assets and liabilities of this position in reference to freedom and ob- jectivity". I will say, then, that the objective of inquiry in a Catholic college is "adequacy of knowledge" ; and the objective of teaching is "the formation of the intelligence as Christian".* ♦Ward, Leo R., Blueprint for a Catholic University, St. Louis, (Herder), 1949, p. 102. [29]</page><page sequence="3">The Christian Scholar Adequacy of knowledge I take to mean simply this: That in the Catholic college the philosophical and theological inquiry must have the preeminence - not pro forma, not in the sense that the two "departments" of theology and philosophy are locally present, occupying space in the required list of studies, but - a real pre- eminence, hierarchic and architectonic. If the Catholic college is to exist as Catholic, the other inquiries simply must not be pursued in isolation from each other and from the architectonic wisdom. We are all familiar with the idea, explicitly professed by many, and obediently assumed by many more, that the mathematical-empirical is the only true way to knowledge. There is no attempt here to undervalue painstaking empirical research ; it is indis- pensable, and it must go forward in every college, whether it possesses a "faith" or not. But the equation of this type of inquiry with knowledge itself is erroneous even in the investigation of matter, and disastrous in the study of man, his nature and destiny, his history and institutions, and his art. Imitation in this respect is the trap that lies in wait for the Catholic college. There is the perfectly natural wish to be respected by the secular colleges in the areas that they recognize and admire. Again, the secular graduate schools, focus- sing on the empirical-mathematical, ignoring the unifying wisdom, have trained many of the leaders of the faculty in the Catholic college, and these men tend some- times to reproduce the training they have received. And lastly, the departmental system tends to isolate philosophy and theology from the rest of the program, and the prized hierarchy of knowledge may become a dead letter, effective only in an eloquent passage of the college bulletin. Insofar as the Catholic college permits the functioning hierarchy, the overreaching wisdom, to become inoperative, and specialization to predominate factually, to that extent is the Catholic college secularized. Philosophically, the Catholic college makes one powerful commitment : to the capacity of intelligence to know reality. In this view truth is not seen as instru- mentalist or pragmatistic, but as an actual coming into contact of the intelligence with reality. Intelligence exists to know being, and all that it can know is being, either in general and diffused notion of being itself or in one or another of its modes that are ultimately reducible to being. j This reaching out of the mind towards being in its various modes gives credence, I think, to the claim that the object of inquiry in the Catholic college is "adequacy of knowledge" even on the philosophical level. The "bond of being" makes is possible for intelligence to know God: as existing, as distinct from the world, as infinite and eternal, as the beginning and end of all things - a body of knowledge of (I need not say) the highest value, available to intelligence itself without the need of revelation or the aid of faith. In this view the capacity of in- telligence to know reality- even the reality of God- saves the knowledge of God from the taint of subjectivism and symbolism. And at the same time our frank affirmation that intelligence cannot know God in the infinite mode in which He [ЗО]</page><page sequence="4">A Symposium possesses His own being avoids the opposite error of a crude anthropomorphism, of a God created in our image. There is no intrusion upon the mystery of God in His own inaccessible self-existence. "Adequacy of knowledge" then, because this is a way of knowing that opens reality, and all of reality, to the inquiring mind. At the same time, the other ways of knowing are not neglected. The experimental-empirical-critical-mathematical, yes, and the philosophical intelligence must be able to manipulate the empirical data with accuracy and confidence. And the poetic experience must be present too : a way of knowing it is, but not simply a product of the intellect. "It is a seeing, a grasping, a knowing, but a knowing involved with our appetites and emotions, whereas the scientific effort is one merely or simply of intelligence."* Theologically, the claim to "adequacy of knowledge" is strengthened, I think, Ъу the opening up to intelligence of all of the new truth that has come through di- vine revelation. Here revelation is seen as a real communication from God to the socialized intelligence of mankind. This communication was made by God over many thousands of years to the patriarchs and prophets and through them to us. Again, no anthropomorphism, no "chats in Paradise", but the important thing is the reality of the communication from the mind of God to the intelligence of man. It was concluded in the revelation which came to us through Jesus Christ, who as God-Man is both the Mediator of revelation and its source. And "faith" is the re- sponse of intelligence to this revelation. If divine revelation is a fact of human history, no knowledge can claim to be adequate without consideration of it. For by means of revelation intelligence is made aware of most profound realities which would have remained forever un- suspected without it. The divine mysteries - of the Trinity, of the grace of man and the fall, of the Incarnation and Redemption - are objects of knowledge eminent- ly worthy of consideration in themselves and moreover they ought to influence lesser knowledge at every stage. For the revealed realities are not to be passively accepted and treasured. Intelligence must work with these realities - the task of theology - must compare, contrast, penetrate, understand to the human limit. Also the revealed wisdom must be ordered vitally together with all secular learning, with the ancient classics and with the newest scientific achievements, with the discoveries of history, and with all new visions in creative literature and the arts. Not too much control, but too much modesty may be the most serious lia- bility of theology in the Catholic college - the modesty of departmentalization. If theology is just another department on a plane with the others; if it merely goes over and over its own subject matter, bearing down forever on the achieved, on the already known; if it fails to move always towards new perspectives and new in- ferences - it will not succeed in this job of unifying intellectual life from its summit of human achievement. I said that the objective of inquiry in the Catholic college is "adequacy of ♦Brennan, Thomas J., Catholic Colleges - Prologue to Revision, Notre Dame, Indiana, (unpublished MSS), p. 28. [ЭЙ</page><page sequence="5">The Christian Scholar knowledge", and that the objective of teaching is "the formation of the intelligence as Christian". I have tried to develop the first of these as well as I could ; now I move on to the second. Ill The "Christian intelligence", then, but first of all intelligence. "The particular concern of the college is intelligence and the things of intelligence, knowledge and the ways of knowledge. If this is so, any deviation from that concern, any attempted substitution for it is, it seems, wrong for the college, however otherwise worthy it may be."* Some of these substitutions are religious piety, "goodness," "character-building," "the whole man," and where they exist they necessarily create some confusion re- garding ends. I am sure that the Christian colleges assume more responsibility for the moral life of their students than the great municipal and state universities do. This is so first of all because they are generally smaller, almost always residential, and be- cause they form a fairly close-knit community. But most of all because they have a "faith". ! The moral concern is right and necessary of course, but in a secondary role : it belongs to the college community as community and not as college. If it becomes predominant (sometimes I think it is the first concern in the minds of parents) the intellectual concern will inevitably deteriorate. Mr. Hutchins in his latest book says that the "custodial" system replaces the educational, and the faculty becomes a group of "adolescent-sitters". As long as the boys and girls "behave themselves", as long as there is no "trouble", everything is thought to be all right and the aca- demic programs move along in their accustomed uncritical routines. There are two areas, however, in which the concern for intelligence and the concern for "life" mingle and cross. One is the virtue of prudence and the other is liturgical worship. It is impossible to teach moral virtues in a "practical-practical" way, so as to produce, as it were, honesty, and justice, and chastity in the learner. And we know that intellectual virtues do not make good men, but good artists or good scientists who may be bad men. But prudence is an intellectual virtue with a difference : it is a matter of right judgment (an intellectual habit), but of right judgment aimed towards right action; and it can provide at least "speculative-practical" standards for the guidance of a student's personal and social life. Prudence can and should enter into the intellectual experience of the student; not only in the class on ethics, but also as giving a philosophical perspective to the social sciences which without the study of prudence can teach us nothing of what societal living should be. And liturgical worship is a way of religious life and prayer, but it is a way of knowing as well. The Mass, the liturgical seasons and the feasts - even the art ♦Brennan, op. cit., p. 3. [32]</page><page sequence="6">A Symposium and gesture of the liturgical actions - are a day-by-day learning experience in the profundities of the mystery of Redemption. In a college where theological science and liturgical life exist in vital connection two great values are achieved: a re- ligious knowledge on a par with the other branches of study, and a piety which is established on doctrine. These are leads, then, towards what I think a Christian intelligence might be : intelligence first of all the primary concern of the college ; prudence as giving per- spective to the "practical" and social studies; and liturgical worship as a way of knowing which brings together all religious knowledge in the outgoing movement of prayer. What is left? I imagine I can only return to the beginning and say that the Christian intelligence is one which first of all is able to relate the various sciences and specialties to each other in the vision of being-as-analogous ; and finally to re- late all human knowledge to the highest reality, the reality of God as known by reason and revelation. The direction of instruction in the Catholic college should be towards the achievement of that kind of intelligence. The mathematical-empirical, exclusively conceived, is the adversary; over-specialization and departmentaliza- tion, whether of the creeping or galloping type, break down the unity of knowledge and introduce confusion. IV Well, then, where do we stand on "order" and "freedom", on "point of view" and "objectivity"? I should say that the Catholic college makes two commitments which induce an order. The first of these is to a realistic theory of knowledge, the capacity of the intelligence to reach truth as reality distinct from the mind. And the second is to revelation as a real communication from God to the collective in- telligence of mankind. Grant that these two commitments represent a "point of view", a framework in which freedom must be exercised. But I don't think it is necessary to apologize for having a point of view, especially since I am convinced that "no point of view" is itself a point of view. Neutralism, scientism, relativism, positivism - the tightest of straitjackets imposed on intelligence. They reduce all ways of knowing to one, and they reduce the dimensions of knowledge to their narrowest : the area of number and mass. These viewpoints have little faith in in- telligence and I fear must produce learned skeptics not educated men. And all the rest is freedom : for the intelligence to move towards adequacy of knowledge in the unity of Being. The great asset of this viewpoint is that no aspect of reality, even the most profound, is considered as forbidden or unapproach- able. The Christian intelligence is free to search the deepest things, and to attempt to reduce bewildering diversity to one single vision. The liability is that Catholic researchers and teachers might fail to use their freedom, perhaps because of imita- tion, at least through an unconscious absorption of a secularist mode of thought. But the point of view itself is sound, I think, aimed at adequacy of knowledge in inquiry, and the formation of the Christian intelligence in instruction. [331</page></plain_text>
