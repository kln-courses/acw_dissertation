Hazlett Konrad Lorenz, author of one of my fa vorite books, King Solomon's Ring, once observed of animals: "How sad and mentally stunted is a caged monkey or parrot, and how incredibly alert, amusing and interesting is the same animal in complete freedom."1 Lorenz, who won the 1973 Nobel Prize for his work, was an ethologist long be fore animal behavior was established as a science. Unable to go to the wilderness, Lorenz studied the behavior of parrots, mice, monkeys, lemurs, and geese in his home. "Who else," he asked, "would dare ask his wife to allow a tame rat to run free around the house, gnawing neat little cir cular pieces out of the sheets to furnish her nests in the Sunday hats."2 Although I had long been interested in animal behavior, I did not get a chance to incorporate it into our high school biology program until we changed from the tradi tional year-long format to a minicourse curriculum comprised of nine-week elec tive courses. I have two reasons for offer ing an animal behavior course: first, the sheer pleasure of learning more about the world by observing animals; and second, the chance that such study will increase our understanding of human behavior. A multi-colored approach The course I offer is for high school stu dents grades 10-12, and has a biology pre Jane Goodall, English scientist studying wild chimpanzees under a National Geo graphic Society grant, meets a baby chimp in Africa's Gombe Stream Game Reserve. While the mother keeps a protective hold around the infant's waist, Ms. Goodall ex tends the back of her hand, fingers turned away, telling the mother that she intends no harm. The baby investigates with his lips, more sensitive than his fingers. requisite. However, it could easily be adapted to older and younger students. We do not rely on any single text, but employ multiple resources, such as li brary books, magazines, newspapers, movies, and filmstrips. Students are en couraged to watch appropriate TV shows, and, wherever possible, live animals are observed. Since the course is limited to nine weeks, content must be selective, so I limit study to seven interrelated units. With the exception of the last unit—a spe cial project—each unit conforms to the same general framework: I start with a short introductory discussion, followed by a statement of specific learning objec tives and a description of activities and available resources. When a student com pletes the unit, he or she takes a test on the material. The course units are: 1. Unlearned behavior patterns (for example, kinesis, taxes, reflexes, and in stinct). Organisms studied in laboratory sessions are planaria, earthworms, hydra, sow bugs, and protists. 2. Learned behavior patterns. Here stu dents read about and discuss Lorenz's discovery of imprinting with graylag geese, Pavlov's experiments with con ditioned learning, and Skinner's observa tions of trial-and-error learning; we also compare degrees of reasoning ability in animals such as raccoons and chimpan zees. 3. Communication. Students collect examples of methods of communication, grouping them into sight, sound, or scent. Robert Redford's record, "Wolves" is popular as is von Frisch's discussion of the bee's dance (see for example, BSCS Blue Version, p. 63).Other animals studied are birds, moths, dolphins, baboons, and chimpanzees. We emphasize the dangers of anthropomorphism and of misinter preting animal signals. 4. Courtship patterns. Students com pete to find the most unusual courtship rituals. Contenders are: stickleback fish, prairie chickens, grouse, bower birds, penguins, and peacocks. 5. Territories. We discuss territorial behavior in terms of survival value both to the individual and the species; consider the connection between such behavior and competition as related to both inter and intra-specific relationships using Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle; and look at two theories of population control (Malthus' theory of control by ex ternal factors, and Wynne-Edwards' theory of control by internal factors). Examples are numerous: predator control for deer in Kaibab National Forest, gan nets (regulating population size), Austra lian magpies, red grouse in Scotland, John Emlen's study of mice, John Calhoun's study of Norway rats, and Eliot Howard's bird studies. 6. Social groups. This unit is the longest. Upon completion, students should be able to distinguish between biological and psychological factors on which societies are based, and to have formulated some hypotheses about why animals form groups. We discuss bees, ants, hunting dogs, baboons, and musk oxen. We also consider the theories of W. C. Allee and Wynne-Edwards. Other phenomena we consider are: social hierarchies (Schjelderup-Ebbe's observa tions of peck-order in chickens); domi nance and leadership (vervet monkeys in Rhodesia, monkey colonies in Japan); parent-child relations (more broadly, care-dependence relationships in verte brate and invertebrate societies); and ef fect of group interaction on play and learning (Karl Gross, C. R. Carpenter, William A. Mason, and Harry and Mar garet Harlow). 7. Special project. The culminating ac tivity of the course is a special project, for which each student does an in-depth study of a zoo animal of choice. The zoo project involves preliminary reading, plus a two-hour observation period dur ing which students watch and record the animal's activities. After the observation period, students have a chance to discuss their impressions with the zoo director. Written reports by students cover all of the relevant behavior patterns previously studied. I try to keep the course flexible, and stimulate student inquiry wherever pos sible; for example, students are encour aged to study their own pets.

Comments—before and after "Why do students enroll in an elective like Animal Behavior?" I asked at the begin ning of the course. The responses were not what I would call encouraging: "I needed another elective;" "I like animals and thought it might be easy;" "It sounded like something different, and I'm tired of all the environmental courses." Post-course comments made me feel much better: "It made me more obser vant, not only about animals, but people too"; "It was the one course that got me interested enough to do reading and re search on my own." One unsolicited opinion came from a senior who told a sophomore: "Take Animal Behavior. It's fun! You'll have to work real hard but you won't even mind it." My greatest satisfaction comes from having contributed to a growing student awareness that there is a place in nature for all organisms, not just humans. Bibliography 1. Ardrey, R.
