HAMMOND University of Arizona Sociology makes use of a wide range of concepts, from very precise technical vocabulary to the spongiest of everyday terms. People who rely on the former may know what they are saying, but often what they are saying no one wants to hear. Cor- relatively, people who rely on concepts of common usage may be interesting, but they may err in conveying meaning they neither intend nor recognize. In this latter case, if the added meanings are systematically biased and unwittingly express a hoped-for condition, they create what author Glasner calls "myths"--albeit myths of scientific origin, not anthropomorphic interpretations of the natural world. "Modernization," "de- velopment," and of course "evolution" itself are candidates for such status. The book under review insists that so, too, is "sec- ularisation," that theories about it "are really generalisations from limited empirical findings... to bolster an implicit ideology of progress" (p. 64). Glasner's book, which was a doctoral thesis at the University of London, is an elaboration of this argument and a proposal for rescuing secularization from the status of myth and using it as a value-free term. These two goals are not equally served. Chapters Two and Three (73% of the book) are more than adequate as arguments that: (a) secularization means many different things, and (b) therefore measures of it make unwarranted assumptions. But the "paradigm" offered to avoid these errors is not particularly helpful. It proposes that secularization refer only to "religions" and never to the "religious" (i.e., to institutions and organization but not to any sacred as- pect of interpersonal relations). Moreover, all "functional" and "inclusive" definitions of religions (e.g., Durkheim's), which might thus classify football enthusiasm or Com- munism as religion, are to be by-passed in favor of substantive, exclusive definitions. The result is a term subsuming various pro- cesses for which indicators can be selected and measures taken. The solution to the ambiguity of secularization and its vulnera- bility to mythification, therefore, is to be arbitrary. At the extreme one could even say: "Let secularization mean the proportion of a population who are members of a religion, defined as an organization declaring itself to be religious. Period." The only problem, of course, is that one would thereby lose all audiences interested in what they mean by secularization. The sponginess of concepts in sociology is to be guarded against, especially as value-laden and systematic bias can creep in unwittingly. In this sense, Glasner's essay is a contribution, even if he engages in over- kill. Most of us probably know there were agonistics among the Arunta but we need reminding of it, just as we need reminding that contemporary life retains some sacred episodes, too. There is a danger, however, that in throwing out all of the, sponginess and all myth-potential, we also throw out all that is of interest. The aim of sociology is not just to do "ethics" in sociologese, but neither is it to do "science" at the cost of intellectual engagement. Those inclined toward this latter view might regard The Sociology of Secularisation as a break- through, but the rest of us will welcome it as merely an addition to the continuing debate over an important concept.</page></plain_text>
