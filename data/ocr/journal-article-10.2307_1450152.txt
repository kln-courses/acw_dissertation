THE inquiry into the philosophical views of the Greek trans- lators of the Bible has as yet been carried to no definite issue. The researches of German scholars between the years 1830-50, uncertain in method as well as wanting in knowledge, have been rectified, but scarcely carried further or definitely com- pleted by more competent investigators. Much difference of opinion accordingly prevails on the subject even at the present time, and one must endeavour to attain to positive results by means different from those hitherto made use of. First, let me call to mind the general course that previous inquiries have taken. Humphrey Hody, with whom the scientific investigation of the Septuagint really begins, was also the first to hold the opinion that the influence of a foreign philosophy is discernible in the Greek translation of certain scriptural passages. He finds traces of the wisdom of the Egyptian priests in the title of the first book of Moses (Genesis) and in the translation of Deut. xxxii. 8.1 About fifty years later, David Michaelis endeavoured to prove2 that in six passages of the Septuagint traces of Gnostic and Mani- chaean teaching are evident. But so faint are these traces ' De bibl. text. origin., p. 115. 2 Dissertatio de indiciis gnosticce philosophic tempore LXX. interpretunm et Philonis Judci, printed in Syntagnla Cowmentationum, Gotting., 1767.

Research in this field was now suspended for a long time, and was only renewed in 1831 by A. F. Gfr6rer, in his " Gescchicte des Urchristenthums."3 This brilliant and learned, but shallow and untrustworthy scholar sees in the LXX. "the source of the beginnings of the Alexandrian theosophy."4 The Alexandrian translators sought to avoid, as Gfr6rer says, all expressions that refer to a visible God, and this deviation from the customary conception of God's existence had the most important consequences on Jewish theology. It necessarily led up to the doctrine of divine powers, of the existence of creatures between God and men, and to that of a transcen- dental God, wholly alienated from the finite world, or what perhaps is more correct, this latter doctrine must be pre- supposed and God's invisibility derived from it.5 All these opinions Gfrorer finds clearly expressed in different passages of the LXX. He supposes that the Greek translators separate God from the visible world; that they are persuaded of the existence of divine beings subordinate to God, and that they invest the Messiah himself "with an eternal and heavenly character."6 A. F. Dahne goes still further in his Geschichtliche Darstellung der jidisch-alexandrinischen Religionsphilosophie.7 He thinks he can show that not only the most important doctrines of Philo, but also those of the Christian Alexandrians, Clement and Origen, were known to the translators, and are traceable in their work. Like Gfr6rer he maintains that they sought in the first place to remove, or to moderate8 many of the human qualities and passions attributed to God in the Bible. Dahne finds a clear expression in the LXX. of the doctrine of creation which Philo teaches in his philosophical writings, viz.: the creation of the world of ideas before that of sensuous things, the denial of creation out of nothing (Creatio ex nihilo), the doctrine of the androgynous Adam, and of the divine creative and preservative powers. Even the ecstasy of the Epopts, the assumption of a two-fold divine revelation, the allegorical exegesis of the Alexandrians,-these and many other strange things Dahlne finds in the translation, both of the Pentateuch and of the other portions of Scripture.9 1 Exegetische Bibliothek, Vol. VIII., p. 716f. 2 Biblische Gnosis, p. 67f. 3 Vol. II.2, p. 8f. 4 Ibid., p. 9. 5 Gfr6rer, ibid., p. 15. 6 Gfrorer, ibid., p. 17. 7 Vol. II., p. 2f.

But in truth his proofs were so arbitrary and insufficient, based on so little knowledge of the language and the method of trans- lation followed by the LXX., that he soon met with violent opposition. H. G. Thiersch criticised the various errors of Dahne in a now almost forgotten, but excellent work.2 But Thiersch threw the force of his criticism on details and left uncontested the fundamental views of Dahne. He no less than the latter believed that the Greek translators anticipated the peculiar doctrines of the Alexandrian philosophers.3 But other scholars, among whom Zacharias Frankel deserves foremost mention, arrived at very different conclusions. In his epoch-making Vorstudien zu der Septuaginta, which appeared in 1841, in his Einfluss der palistinischen Exegese auf die alexandrinisehe Hermeneutik, a work published ten years later, and in smaller essays, Frankel clearly showed that Gfrorer and Dahne not only had committed errors, but that their hypothesis is built up on wholly insecure foundations; that they do not prove the influence of Greek philosophy on the Septuagint; that this influence is certainly less than they supposed, and that it is only the avoidance of anthropo- morphism and anthropopathism which is discernible most decidedly in the translation of the Pentateuch, less distinctly in other books of the Bible, which were translated at a later period; and that not Greek philosophy, but Palestinian influence produced this effect.4 E. Zeller agrees with Frankel in all essential points about the pretended philosophy of the LXX. The renowned author of the Philosophie der Griechen says': Some of the translators were offended at the physical manifestations of Jehovah, but from that circumstance, as well as from the translations of other passages, we dare not conclude that the LXX. were familiar with -Platonic or Stoical philosophy, or that the doctrines of the school of Philo were shared by them. There is no reason to suppose "more than a small and superficial contact with Greek ideas." See the remarkable essay of Georgi in Ilgen's Zeitschrift, 1839, Vol. IV., p. 50. 2 De Pentateuchi Vers. Alexandrina (Erl., 1841), p. 43ff. 3 Ibid., p. 41, p. 43. 4 See especially Vorstudien, p. 175 s.; c. Einfluss, p. 30f, 82f, 130f; Pald'tin. und alexandrin.

With this negative result the first researches into the philosophical views of the LXX. close, but we cannot be satisfied with it. For even if all the arguments of Gfr6rer and Dahne do not stand the test, does it necessarily follow that their hypothesis itself is false ? Cannot new and more careful researches prove the same assertions with other argu- ments? As long as criticism did not go beyond the refutation of Gfrorer and Dahne, there was no certainty on the subject of the philosophical or non-philosophical spirit of the Greek translation. It hence resulted that the judgments of the most learned inquirers differed widely from one another. Frankel, who by a more accurate explanation of hitherto misunder- stood passages had eliminated so many philosophical theories supposed to have been insinuated into the translation, re- peatedly speaks of the philosophical exegesis of the LXX.,' and regards some words as bearing a philosophical import- ance, which Zeller thinks quite insignificant.2 Though Zeller contradicts the extreme views of Dahne, he nevertheless believes that in some passages traces may be found of the anthropological terminology of Plato and the Stoics.3 Siegfried, one of the greatest living authorities on Jewish Hellenism, thinks it doubtful whether there are any traces of Greek philosophy in the LXX. Yet he supposes that the doctrine of the intellectual world, the cO6Auoo vYotrrot, is expressed in the translation of Gen. i. 2.4 But if we indeed find that this Platonic, or rather Philonic, doctrine is embodied in the TXX., we should naturally expect to find many other philosophical doctrines more in accord with the ideas that were current in the Alexandrian school. G. W. Bickell, in fact, discovers such other doctrines. He declares5 that the avoidance of anthropomorphism and anthro- popathism (which, as he thinks, is in no book more rigidly observed than in the translation of the book of Job,) was con- nected niost intimately with Alexandrian theology and the allegorical exegesis, and that both point to a long acquaintance with Greek, especially Platonic, philosophy. He thinks that the doctrine of God's absolute unchangeability, of his complete unity, and of matter as the source of Evil, must have been the cause of certain interpretations of Scriptural passages found in the LXX. The foregoing facts are enough to show the uncertainty 1 Einfluss, pp. 21, 30, 82, 130. 2 Palast. und alex.

The question arises whether there are no means of removing the doubts which have hitherto existed. It is evident that the most cautious and acute exegesis of single passages of the LXX. cannot provide them. For very often the Hebrew original that lay before the translators is no longer dis- coverable, or the reading and the meaning of the Greek text are alike doubtful. Copyists, commentators and editors, each in their various ways, have contributed to bring the original text of the LXX. to its present state of confusion. Under such circumstances it is impossible from individual passages to recognise the spirit which inspired the translators in their work.' But it is probable that the examination of the large linguistic material of the LXX. will lead us to safe results. Researches like those which Frankel, Thiersch and others made in respect to the grammar of the Septuagint, can and must be extended to philosophical questions. Here the sources of errors are fewer, the chance of mistake is reduced by the large number of passages to be examined, and we may therefore hope that cautious researches in this field wili lead to the desired end.2 In spite of the great difference of opinion as to the sense of single words and expressions in the LXX., we may certainly believe, that if Greek philosophy influenced the translation of the Septuagint, this influence must not only be discernible here and there, but must find its expression in the choice of certain fixed technical terms. As there is no philosophy in a technical sense to be found in the Hebrew Scriptures, if the translators of the Septuagint actually were in contact with philosophical ideas, the choice of certain expressions for psychological, ethical and metaphysical notions, must clearly show difference between the original and the translation. To what result do we come, if we look at the LXX. from this point of view ? i One instance in place of many may demonstrate this fact. The words of the second verse of Genesis Il2I V1f ln nr~ r^l~i' are translated Kaai 7 yi 7iv d6parog icai icaTraacfvanroc. Dahne (l.c.. p. 11), and Thiersch (l.c., p, 44), see in these words a clear allusion to the doctrine of the creation of a spiritual before the sensual world. Zeller (l.c., p. 255) declares they were chosen without any arriere p(ensee, and Bickell agrees with him (l.c., p. 6). Frankel, however, attacks their genuineness (Paldst. und Aler. Schriff., p. 24). Siegfried (Phtilo, p. 8), returns to Dihne's opinion. 2 Not long ago the late Dr. Edwin Hatch, in his learned essays on Biblical Greek (Oxford, 1889, p. 94f), examined the sense of some psychological notions in the LXX. He, however, mainly contents himself with the mere reckoning up of the manifold translations of Hebrew words, without entering into the particulars of the meaning and the origin of the ideas expressed.</page><page sequence="6">The Jewish Quarterly Review. The investigation of words like JvXOi, arao-Ontv, voiv, fp6vio'tl , avSpela, JperT, 7rp6vota, K6Ocos and other philosophical terms gives us an unequivocal answer to this question. 1.--VuX7'. The meanings of the Greek word *rvxy are equivalent to those of the Hebrew trm. Therefore the one is the common translation of the other, as we see in a great many passages. But in some respects rvx) deviates from tw. The Hebrew word, which originally means "breath," "breeze," "blast," denotes ordinarily the principle of life, sensuous as well as spiritual, but occasionally it is used as synonymous with "man," "person"; sometimes it even signifies "dead body," "corpse." To the Greek word *v)vX these significations are wanting.1 When once philosophical refection had grasped the difference between soul and body, 'vX1j tended to become more and more abstract, and in educated speech it loses the sensual connotation which it formerly possessed. Where w:= is used in this sensual meaning, the Greek translator, if he had not felt it his duty to translate literally, would have had to deviate from the original. So even the Aramaic translators often render tt5n by Wu: or tw -1.2 In the LXX. we very seldom find such deviations, in the Pentateuch only twice (Gen. xiv. 21, and xxxvi. 6), in the rest of the Bible only four times, and that in a single chapter (Joshua x. 28, 30, 35, 39). In the great num- ber of passages, where twtn means "living being," "man," ( person," " slave," or " dead body," "corpse," the LXX., heedless of the true sense of the Greek word, uses 4vXr. For instance Gen. i. 24, CEaryay&amp;ew ' 7y} -4rvXv coa-av; xii. 5, Kcat nraa-av rfv%?XV Iv eTcra'oaro3; xlvi. 15, 7raala ai 4vxal, viol Kcal OvyaTrepe, and the same v. 18, 22, 25, 26, 27, and in many other passages. So we read (Lev. vii. 8-10), vX'7, Ttl e'av a7p aTro Kpe&amp;v and (Lev. vii. 11; xxii. 6), a&amp;v afr'TaL 7ra'PTo 7rpa7ryaroTO or eav 8e VXt . rpt,cepu S p P 8&amp;pov (Lev. ii. 1), and similar expressions (Lev. iv. 2, 27; v. 1, etc.); Deuter. xxiv. 7 (9), we find KXETrrTO *vX'v.-More decidedly the LXX. deviate from the Greek use In some dictionaries q4vX7 is translated by "person " on the ground of passages like Soph. (ad. R(ol. 1207; El. 775, 786, 1127; Aristoph. Nub., 711; Polyb. viii. 5, 3. But this translation is not the right one. In all these and similar passages the true sense of PvXr is "life," "soul," or "spirit." 2 See Frankel, Einfltusx, p. 126. Isaiah xxix. 8; xliii. 4; Jer. li. 14; Prov. xiii. 4; xvi. 26; xxiv. 12; Psalm xl. 3, and in some other passages the trans- lation of bD) is not literal, but it has its usual sense. Hatch did not take notice of many of these passages. 3 Frankel sees the influence of the Agadah in this translation (Einfluss, p. 48). The analogous translations prove that this opinion is groundless. 210</page><page sequence="7">Are there Traces of Greek Philosophy in the Septuagint ? 211 of language where they put tvX2 instead of verKpO, as Lev. xix. 28, evro7/iSag ov 7roto-erTe C7r6 kvx., xxi. 11, e'7r trary, FVX, rTETreXvKvia; Num. v. 2 and ix. 6, tciKaapTov O 7ri pvX.I This use of the word explains why #rvx is declared to be identical with blood, even in a passage where the masoretic text does not precisely make this identification. So Levit. xvii. 11, ryap qvXi) rraairS oapKoq al/'a avTroV eriV, where the Hebrew text reads stqn 0t: nwnNn tul : N0 the soul of every living thing is in the blood. (See also Lev. xvii. 14; Deut. xii. 23.) This meaning of wm: and therefore of jvXv occurs in the other books of the Scripture less frequently than in the Pentateuch. But we can quote Jer. xliii. 6 (1. 6); Ezech. xliv. 25; Hag. ii. 13; Psalm civ. (cv.) 18; cxxiii. (cxxiv.) 4; Prov. xiii. 25; 1 Chr. v. 21. These and similar passages show how extensive this use of the word is.1 No servile dependency on the Hebrew original can have induced this translation. For in that of the Pentateuch, as well as in that of most books of the Bible, we find very numerous deviations from the original, as Frankel2 and Thiersch3 have conclusively proved. We even find the un- Greek use of frvX, where the Hebrew text does not use wr, but employs quite another word. Thus *v%X is the transla- tion of tnn, Ezech. xliv. 25; of 7tz, Prov. xiii. 25,4 of Wts, Lev. xvii. 9 (in a great number of manuscripts collated by Holmes). We may therefore conclude, that if the Greek translators give to vuvX? the meaning of "person," "slave," dead body," "corpse," they could not be familiar with the abstract meaning which the word obtained in later Greek, and they could not be conscious of the opposition between body and soul, which is sharply accentuated in Greek philosophy. 2.-L vo. The consideration of this word shows how little the Greek translators understood the method of expressing the difference between the sensuous and tle spiritual, and how unphilosophically they reasoned. Ilvor, etymologically syno- nymous with vrvevjua, is not often used in good Greek. It 1 The use of this word in apocryphal books and in the New Testament is the same as in the LXX.

But the word is never used for the principle of spiritual life, it is never synonymous with ikux or vovg. And just in the last-named sense 7rvo' is used in the LXX.

The men who translated the Scripture in this manner could not have been acquainted with the terminology of Greek psychology. 3.-Noi39. Remarking how often the LXX. substitutes voiXq for such expressions as: " heart," " ear," "breath," one might be tempted to consider this as due to the influence of Greek philosophy. But a more exact examination shows us, that voie in the LXX. has the same meaning as in common speech, and not as in phi- losophy. It does not denote the spiritual principle of life, or in- tellectual activity, but " opinion,"" attention," " resolution," and similar notions. So Exod. vii. 23, and Isaiah xli. 22, ViE'OTn70E Toy voiv; Job vii. 17, 7TPOaEXEwV T'OV vovv for 1 , 7 and the same sense is expressed also by Kap&amp;tav TtOevat (Prov. xxii. 17; xxvii. 23). In a similar sense the word is used Jos. xiv. 7, KcaTra ToV vovy a&amp;'ro'v (or atr6'/ T in many manuscripts) for 7 y I "accordingc to his wish"; Job vii. 20, t CWTOTa/LEVO9L TOV VOVDV TCZV a'vOpC0rwv, " he who knows the in- tentions," and Jsaiah x. 12, EMwKIa,4oipat. 6'7r'b TV VOV3V T'OV ,i'yav "I shall watch over the proud mind." In the sense of reso- lution we find it in Isaiah xl. 13, Tt' 6yv.o voiv iwpiov. That this is the true sense of the word is proved by the parallel idea that follows Trk azrroV3 o0-t fovXo9 ?-EVETO, and by another passage (Is. x. 7), a6raXXa~eti 6 voi^e ai'TOV for Tr_tMM1 There is much difficulty in deciding on the meaning, of a certainly corrupt passacre, Prov. xxxi. 3 (xxiv. 71,) where we find a double translation of -I1vi voij9 KcaL f3ioq and Job xxxiii. 16, where rK "ear" is translated voii.

These terms are employed, both in the common speech and loosely by writers acquainted with philosophy, not only for sense-perception but also for "mental conception," "obser- vation, and so forth.

In this unusual meaning we find the word most frequently in Proverbs (ii. 10 ; v. 2; x. 14; xi. 9; xii. 1, 23 ; xiv. 6, 7, 18; nv. 7, 14, etc.), but besides these instances and the passages from Exodus already quoted, the same use of the term may be noted in Isaiah xlix. 26, tIvCoVO ?a7ovTat ,ab aiuO-9'OaTT 7raaa ac'p, and Job xxiii. 5, aiuaoi e7v t ?tva ,o ~ a7rayyeXEt. One may fairly maintain that no one acquainted with the philosophical and more particularly with the psychological terminology of the Greeks, would have used a't'a-O,cr-t as a synonym with f7rrt0-TnJZ or o-oota. But as this is done by the translator of Proverbs, who surpasses the majority of the translators of the Bible in knowledge of Greek, he mlust as decidedly as the others be pronounced igrnorant of the fun- damental notions of Greek philosophy. 8.-ApeTrYj. ApET'r, as is well known, originally signifies man's power and capacity; hence the term serves to denote all bodily and moental excellences, and, though more rarely, their effects or "great achievements," or the "glory," or " fame " acquired in consequence. Thus Sophocles says (Phil. 1420) a&amp;GavaTov ap,e7r7v eo-ov, and Pindar (Ist1ini. v. 49) '*flXa, 9 aparaPT (tva/aL'veLv. In philosophical language these usages fall into the background, and the abstract sense of "virtue" prepon- derates. But it is precisely this ethical meaning, which a'fterwards becamec universal, that is never found in the Sep- tuagint. 'ApET' is there used only as a translation of rs*mn nn, and synonymous terms, in the sense of "praise," "glory," honour," "excellence," "quality worthy of honour."

The same may be seen in Zech. vi. 13; Isaiah xliii. 21 ; lxiii. 7. Later on, aiGO4aewc was altered into aootac; hence both words appear in some codices. One would be inclined to read voipiwv for aiacO?jwL, but that the latter is so often used in this sense. 2 There is no reason to believe that the Greek translators wrote aiaOav- elqaErat, which we read now in the manuscripts and editions of the LXX.</page><page sequence="12">T1Ie Jewish Quarterly Review. The purely ethical signification of the word is found for the first time in those books of the Apocrypha that were originally written in Greek. Thus 2 Mace. vi. 31, ,vrlt,Oavvov appeTr? KarTaXL7r'v; Wisdom iv. 1, KpelaOov Treicvia /per' aperiT. So with Wisdom v. 13; viii. 7, and frequently in the fourth book of the Maccabees. In the New Testament the word is almost always employed in the same fashion as in the LXX. (comp. 1 Pet. ii. 9; 2 Pet. i. 3; Phil. iv. 8). Only in one passage does the word seem used in the philosophical sense, viz.: in 2 Pet. i. 5, where we read: e7rLXopryrla-aTe v E Tvt 7raT0eE vi&amp;v rTv dperTiv, ev Se r daperTj r7rv /yvcio-v, In your faith supply virtue, and in your virtue knowledge."' 9.--AvSpeta, avSpetog. No word is less exposed, either by etymology or usage, to mis-interpretation than advpela. Already popularly used, to express " manliness " and " courage," ethical inquiry restricted the term still more closely within these prescribed limits.2 The LXX. neglect this usage most markedly. In Prov. xii. 4; xxxi. 10, b'rn rit is translated by yvvr7 UvSpeia (and conse- quently, the same is the case with Sir. xxvi. 2; xxviii. 15); in Eccles. ii. 21; iv. 4; v. 10, 1inw2, and in Ps. lxvii. (lxviii.) 7, FnlrTl is rendered ;vSpeta; in Prov. xv. 19, tntv become avSpeEot, and so do the Q41n of Prov. x. 4; xiii. 4. The word thus denotes here not the " brave " but the " excellent," being used as a synonym with /ya0o6, Xpqprw7 . Hence, it is never employed in the LXX. for rnl=. In the Apocrypha, the ethical idea again comes clearly to the front (Wisdom viii. 7; 4 Macc. 271, 28. 284, 6 Bekk.); in the New Testament the word is altogether wanting. 10.-MeryaXo7rpe7rrsf, pteyaXo7rpe7reta. The latter term has a sharply circumscribed ethical signifi- cation, of which Aristotle (Eth. Nic. iv. 4, 1122 a, 18.) gives evidence. It denotes the generosity of the noble man, who is equally removed from petty avarice on the one side and lavish extravagance on the other. The use of the word by the LXX. shows no trace of this ethical meaning. Here it signifies merely external splendour, serving as a translation for 'ln Compare Hatch (loc. cit., page 40), who regards this passage as very dif- ficult, and leaves it unexplained. 2 Compare Plato, Lacles; Aristotle, E.i III., ch. 9; Rhct.

The TXX. however does not use 7rpovota, the term technically expressive of the idea of Provi- dence from the fifth century onwards, but CTT-KOTT r or other words. Ip6ovota occurs only once, and then signifies merely 'knowing" or "deliberating," like the corresponding verb TrpovoerOate. Compare Job xxiv. 15, ov 7rpovorael Ie o/0ba\/oL; Prov. iii. 4, Kal 7rpovoov 'aX\ (t iu'..,T.); Jos. xx. 3, ?raTctavTr ,vX;jv aicovalrco avev 7rpovota9.1 In the Apocrypha we for the first time encounter the word in the connotation given to it by philosophy. The author of the Wisdom, who was very familiar with Platonic and Stoic ideas, says, xiv. 3, ] U8 ao\, rdareip, &amp;acuv- ,/epva 7rpovota and vi. 8, 6`oiow 'rrpovoe (6 Oebo) repi 7rcavrcov. So also 2 Mace. xiv. 9, rov yevov9 '7uwv 7rpovojTFrC, and in many places in the fourth book of the Maccabees. It is noteworthy that vrpo'voa in the sense of "divine Providence" is also absent from the New Testament. 12.-K6o-t/o?. K6Rtpo0, from the time of Empedocles (v. 299 Sturz) fre- quently used by philosophers in the sense of "world," or "universe," in almost the same sense as To 7rav, is employed by the LXX. only in the original meaning of "ornament," "arrangement," "drawing up of an army," and even for "army" itself. Thus it is the translation of ' T r /rnS'Dn 8,1s,2 while it is never found in the LXX. with the meaning "world." It is otherwise with the Apocrypha and the New Testament. Wisdom contains passages like these: vi. 26, 7rkXTOo 8e aof)Wv aTor~7pia Icoa-ov; vii. 17, el'val o-V'rvaoaLv KcOafov; xi. 18, cKT'aara rOv KOSro v e' daopjov AVXi', etc. The second and fourth books of the Maccabees also are acquainted with this meaning, which is the usual sense in which the word is used in the New Testament. ' These last two words are wanting in the great majority of MSS. 2 Zezschwitz in his stimulative but superficial Profalngrlcitat und bibliscAlcr Sprachgeist, p. 22, believes that the LXX., in translating NZY by i6apoc, either confused c0Y with )'Y, or meant to represent the stars as the ornament of heaven. But the true signification is apparent from Nahum ii. 9, where T31ln is rendered Kroaoc, and from Ezekiel xxiii. 41, and Eccl. vii. 13 (14), where l]t and I1p are translated icoapiv. This author's remarks on the use of the word in the New Testament are ingenious but unfounded.</page><page sequence="14">The Jewish Quarterly Review. The consideration of the foregoing terms shows that the LXX. were unacquainted with the usages of language which the Greek philosophers had brought into circulation; the philosophical meanings of terms like a'oroo-'Lq, fp6ovrfl't, vovW, avSpela, a'pwov remained unknown to them; words in common use like apeTr, 'oCaelvv, oc7rLO0, ' feryaXo7rpe7reLa, Xo7yo9, E18o0, iSe6, v\rj, 7rpovota, they never employ in the sense which philosophy has assigned to them. It is incon- ceivable that the philosophy of the Greeks can have exer- cised any considerable influence over men who betray so complete an ignorance of the most common psychological and ethical terms, or that the LXX. were influenced by the Platonic, Aristotelian or Stoic systems. And these conclusions are true not merely for certain portions of the LXX., but for the whole of it. For in regard to the use of these philosophical terms no difference can be de- tected between the oldest and what are probably the latest translations, between the version of the Pentateuch and that of Job and Nehemiah, between the historical and the poetical books, between the translation of the Prophets and that of the Hagiographa. The arguments that could be adduced against these con- clusions, arguments that have indeed been brought forward to show the influence of philosophy on the LXX., are of no real weight. Objectors point to a few instances of trans- lations which are thought to bear a philosophical stamp. But he who has learnt to recognise the unphilosophical character of the LXX. from the mass of evidence here collected will not be misled by single words and stray expressions. In the unlimited state of corruption in which the text of the LXX. has come down to us, a suspicion of spurious- ness must fall upon every word that contradicts a well- established fact. Even an appeal to the oldest LXX. text could not entirely weaken this suspicion, since, as Philo's quotations prove, the text of the LXX. was already at the earliest period disfigured with corruptions of manifold character. We do not however need this method of escape, a method always dubious in the eyes of timid critics. He who does not venture to follow Gfrorer and Dahne, in introducing into the Greek translation of the Bible, Platonic, Stoic, Philonic and Gnostic dogmas, on the strength of arbitrary and forced in- terpretations that violate the rules of the language; who, with Thiersch, Frankel and Zeller, stigmatises the procedure of these writers as unscientific, will expect to find the trace of foreign systems of philosophy at the most in but few pas- 218</page><page sequence="15">Are there Traces of Greek Philosophy in the Septuagint ? 219 sages, and even this diminutive trace to vanish on closer examination. The LXX. translation of Job vii. 15, and of Psalm 1. (li.) 14 reminds Zeller' of the anthropological terminology of Plato and the Stoics. In the first passage, where the original runs 3i pmrv3 nirnrm, we find td7raXXaaeL a7ro 7rvevanro' i LO' v 7vy v%7rv Jiov. It is, however, not clear what these words would signify in Platonic or Stoical terminology. With Plato 'rvev.la plays so subordinate a part that I cannot understand why the translators should have here introduced this idea. In the doctrine of the Stoics, moreover, the soul itself is a 7rvevia, and therefore there can be no reference to this doctrine in the passage before us, where a separation of the wrvevfa from the uvJrX is spoken of. As a matter of fact, there is probably some corruption in the text under consideration. It is not the habit of the translator of Job without pressing reasons to depart from the original to the extent that he must have done in this instance, if the text were genuine. We must therefore, in accordance with the Cod. Alex. and 157 (Parsons), eliminate ,/ov, and with a very slight emendation read 'nvyi',/taTro for 7rvev4a'ro%, just as in Nahum ii. 13 (12), p.rn. is translated 7re&amp;rvtse. In this way only do the Greek words receive a good meaning, and correspond with the thought expressed in the second part of the verse. The words of Ps. 1. (li.) 4, ^S:=n ,njr= n ni are represented in the LXX. by Icat 7rvev,arJT rT^yelovticw ao'rfplt6v #te. The words refer to God, not at all to the spirit of man. Interpreted in a Stoic sense they would therefore introduce into the Bible the grossest materialism, comparing God to a breath. As we cannot attribute this to the LXX., we must perceive in the rendering before us but an echo of Stoic phraseology, and no sign of the influence of Stoic teaching. In fact, Zeller,2 with his delicate tact, speaks only of the "terminology" and not of the "philosophy" of the Stoics. It may, however, be that i7?yelovuKov was selected as an equivalent for nTrn3 without the faintest influence of Stoicism. For the ordinary trans- lation of 1=N' is appXov or ,vvdta?T'. (Compare Is. xxxii. 5; Ps. lxxxii. 12; cvi. 40; Job xii. 21; xxi. 28; Jud. v. 93; Prov. xvii. 27; xxv. 7, and frequently). The word doparov for inn in the second verse of Genesis was according to Zeller4 chosen without any arri?re pensee. Philos. d.

Frankel and Siegfried1 differ from this view and both see in the phrase an echo of the K6O0TLO vo0ro? of Philo. This is untenable.

That a dis- tinction between the invisible world of ideas and the world of sensible things could not have been intended in this place is shown by the co-ordinate expression aKcaraTacetvaroT which has no meaning if applied to the cKOO6oC? vorTr6O.

It cannot well be denied that God is here described as the eternally existent, and it is difficult to suppose that any change has occurred in the text. Still there is here nothing that compels us to assume the influence of Stoic or Neo-Pytha- gorean philosophy. For Palestinian exegesis explains these important words in the same manner,2 and the terminology of the philosophers would have required T' o6v in place of 0 C V.

Precisely in these passages, however, it is con- clusively seen how unphilosophically the LXX. went to work. AiaO8rptKC6 is in neither passage what Greek philoso- phy would have conveyed by the term-it is used not for "what is capable of perception by the senses," but for e'j7raO0r , "perceptible," "sensible"; in the latter passage indeed it is used to translate rn:p=" jealous."

The Stoics also, when they do not purposely employ popular language, call the deity ro Bv (Stob., ecl. 1, 374, Diels. doxogr. p. 463, 14f.) The deity to the Neo- Platonists is rb 'iv (Plotinus, Enn. vi. 9, 3, etc.) It is only Philo who calls God now rb ov and now 6 Zv. This is because he taught the personal God of the Bible, and was influenced by the passages in the LXX. quoted above. 220</page><page sequence="17">Are there Traces of Greek Philosophy in the Septuagint ? 221 chology, but they misinterpreted it and gave it a thoroughly unphilosophical meaning. The same inference, though to a lesser extent, may be drawn from Jeremiah iv. 19, where aloOrffrjpa 'ri} IcapS[ia is spoken of. For the plural here em- ployed does not accord with philosophical usage, in which the heart-or according to others the brain-is the single common organ of sense, airGTrrjjplov, while it would be impossible to speak of the " sense-organs of the heart."l Bickell finds an indication of the influence of Greek philo- sophy on the LXX. in the efforts of the translators to avoid ascribing human form and feelings to God. His remarks run thus: (1. c., p. 5), "Haec autem detestatio anthropomor- phismorum et anthropopathismorum arctissime cohseret et cum theologia alexandrina et cuim interpretatione allegorica; utraque autem nonnisi post longiorem philosophiae graecae, imprimis platonicae cognitionem oriri potuit. Apud Philonem perspicere possumus omnes causas illius detestationis e philo- sophia greca desumptas esse, nempe immutabilitatem Dei absolutam (aTpe7rrov T' O eov), ejusdem simplicatem per- fectam, e quacum omnibus qualitatibus, nedum membris et affectibus carere concludit, opinionerm denique que materiae et corpori causam mali et peccati tribuit. Heec ergo dogmata philosophica antecedebant, rejectio anthropomorphismorum ea consecuta est." We must pronounce this argument absolutely groundless. It is improper calmly to assign to the translators of the LXX. the same reasons that Philo gives for his assumption of a Deity without attributes-grounds which certainly coincide most closely with the views of the Greek philosophers. Such a method of historical inquiry is hardly better than the procedure of Dahne, which no one has more sternly censured than Bickell himself.2 The LXX. did not need the stimulus of Greek philosophers to induce them to assign an interpretation dif- ferent from the literal one to numerous passages in the Bible, in which bodily parts and properties are ascribed to God,- to soften or to paraphrase a pictorial or poetical mode of expression. The Bible itself was bound to lead to a spiritual interpretation of such passages by remarks such as we find in Numbers xxiii. 19; Deut. iv. 15; 1 Sam. xv. 29; Is. xl. 18; Mal. iii. 6.

For who would venture to ascribe to the Soferim, Onkelos and Pseudo-Jonathan a knowledge of systems of philosophy which could only be acquired after a long devotion to their study ? Whoever cannot bring himself to dispute these arguments can find no ground on which to dispute the conclusions arrived at from the foregoing examination. He will, therefore, recog- nise that the translation of the so-called Septuagint bears no traces of the inroad of Greek philosophy into Jewish Hellenism. J. FREUDENTHAL. Frankel also accepts this view, but the grounds upon which he supports it are untenable. His words are (V orstudien, p. 175): " From the fact that the anthropomorphisms recur more frequently in the most recent portions of the LXX., which were composed at a time when Platonism and Greek philo- sophy in general were more prevalent and widely known, it may be deduced that Greek philosophic theories exercised but little influence upon the trans- lators. The very desire, indeed, to avoid anthropomorphisms by euphemistic turns of speech seems to have been borrowed from Palestine." The fact on which Frankel here relies is incapable of proof. It is not true that in the later translated books the anthropomorphisms become more and more numerous. In no part of the translation are they avoided more markedly (as Bickell has shown) than in Job, which was certainly only composed at a late date. But Bickell is himself entirely in error, when he says (l.c.) that apart from Job the conscious avoidance of anthropomorphisms is only visible in seven other passages of the LXX. One needs to give but a very moderate attention to the Greek translation of the Bible, and a mere glance into the ample material collected by Frankel to rebut this strange assertion, which is apparently based upon the few instances used by Gfrorer.</page></plain_text>
