<plain_text><page sequence="1">Henry Moore: The Greatest Living Sculptor Pierre Szekely Abstract-Sculptor Henry Moore and his work are eulogized in this memorial speech delivered to UNESCO House, Paris, October 1986. It is in these terms that I liked to talk about Henry Moore while he was still alive. Now that the news of his death has reached us, I say again: Henry Moore is one of the greatest living sculptors since the master of the Venus of Willendorf. Living, in the sense that the language of the Egyptian priests, carvers of the immortal figures of Luxor, has given to that word. Living, in the sense of life that transcends death. Living, in the sense of surpassing time-in contrast to time that passes, in contrast to time that flows like a river, 'beyond-time' does not pass, it is. 'Beyond-time' does not ebb away, it is the inexhaustible source of transcendent life. I feel this each time I come face to face with a work of Henry Moore. Thus it was, one fine day in Paris, I was welcomed in the garden of the Rodin Museum by two seated, majestic figures in bronze, the King and Queen. I was not alone at this audience: a gentleman, older and better dressed than I, wearing a dark suit for the occasion, ferreted around the sculpture, obviously worried. Turning to me, he said, "Excuse me, sir, but living people don't look like this!" "You are right, sir", I faltered in the language of Shakespeare, "living people don't look like this-but life looks like this." The gentleman pointed his finger to the sky and said with conviction, "Now I understand." The title of the Book of the Dead, often wrongly translated, should be the Book of Life. Life has birth within it as well as death; both come together, forming an indissoluble whole. It is the great figure reclining on the lawn here, in front of UNESCO House, that taught me how to see, at the same time, sensual woman and procreating mother as well as the recumbent, dying figure. Henry Moore's Pierre Szekely (sculptor), 3 bis, Impasse Villiers de l'Isle Adam, 75020 Paris, France. Text of Henry Moore memorial speech delivered at UNESCO House, Paris, October 1986. Translated from the French by Josephine de Linde. book of life; the shelter drawings he made in his sketchbook in the shadowy passages of the London underground during the air raids of the Second World War in his capacity as official war artist, testify to his great discovery. In the standing, sitting, crouching or lying-down figures, he saw fear, fear of death. He saw fear eating into human flesh, as erosion wears away the stones of the ocean; stones that he collected with predilection. For him, bones, the skull of an elephant, furnished other proofs of the internal-external life of forms. In seeing the 'filled' spaces interlaced with solid forms, I am reminded of a poem by Lao Tse called "the action of the negative". The wheel turns thanks to the space between its spokes; only the emptiness of the cup renders it useful, comments the Old Boy. Nowadays, he would say perhaps that the void sculpted by Moore is harder than the stone since the stone itself cannot penetrate the void. I first 'met' Henry Moore in front of his reclining Yucatan figures, those sacrificial offerings of wrenched-out hearts, present- day works in the line of his forbears. But it required fate to lead me to Carrara in 1962 to meet him in person. In a fit of contrariness, if not for practical reasons, he was exhibiting bronzes there. After looking at photographs of my sculptures, he said: "It's strong. I like it." Several years later, he invited me, young sculptor that I was, to come to see him at Much Hadham. The day of my visit, I was able to see again the King and Queen enthroned on the lawn, as immobile as the hub of the Buddhist wheel. I saw the master of these monarchs working with his assistants on the major commission for the Lincoln Center of New York, moulded in a studio constructed especially for this work. In his apartment, the empty spaces between furniture, ornaments, sculptures and drawings were dense; the rooms echoing passionate conversations, ex- changes of ideas, projects, perceptive intuitions. In his secretary's small office, a wall cabinet offered visitors a choice of photographs of Moore's sculptures. These photographs had been taken by the sculptor himself since, he said, no other person, no other photographer, was capable of choosing the angle. He allowed me to choose a photograph. I chose two. He frowned, then smiled. I explained that only one of the images would remain in my possession; the other would go to enrich the collection of photographs preparing "The Highway of the Arts", my trans-national project which, as early as 1962, had interested my great friend at UNESCO, Gomez Machado. Henry Moore liked this project: an itinerary linking capital cities, towns, villages; a route marked by milestones, in other words monumental sculptures; a route passing unchecked through the network of our political frontiers. He authorised me to write and talk of his complete approval of the project whenever the occasion arose. On leaving him, on the cross-Channel ferry, turning back to the steep, rocky cliffs of the English coast, I imagined a 'reclining figure' on the scale of that island. Another year, the roads of Scotland became for me the highway of the arts of Henry Moore. There, gradually discover- ing this landscape glorified by his sculptures and his sculptures ennobled by the landscape, I was reminded of his remark: "I would rather have a piece of sculpture put in a landscape, almost any, than in or on the most beautiful building I know." All the same, his mysterious forms on the front of the Time-Life building in London are well placed. After all, the city is also a landscape. It is a forest constructed by man. From time to time a Trojan horse, in the form of con- temporary sculpture, must penetrate it to confirm the victory of art in present-day cities. It gave me a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction to see many of Moore's works in squares, in parks and on street corners in London. ? 1988 ISAST Pergamon Press pic.

Great, not in the way the Eiffel Tower or the Tower of London is, but great as the love of life can sometimes be. His greatness is that of our enthusiasms, our fears, sufferings, and peculiarities, our thirst for discovery. As long as the human race has eyes to see light fade mysteriously into areas of shadow, as long as we have hands with which to caress solid forms and to venture into cavities, as long as we know how to recognize yew, sycamore and walnut, as long as we are able to distinguish between travertine, serpentine and 'bird's eye' marble, as long as we know how to appreciate Florentine bronze or turquoise patina, as long as our individual lives are defined by our faculty to be born and to die, Henry Moore will be a great living sculptor among us. Products of our planet used by Moore are named: Portland stone, that of Hopton Wood, Mansfield, the brown and the green stone of Hornton, the stone of Corsehill, siderite, the stones of Ancaster, of Burgundy, of Ham Hill, African wonderstone, Cumberland alabaster, anhydrite; but also the woods, teak, beech, guaiacum, pynkado.... Stones and trees were created for him, so that he could continue to create them in his image. Allow me, as a sculptor, to add a final word: figuration and realism, abstraction and non-figuration, have become the cardinal points of the compasses we use in the jungle of contemporary art. I discarded this compass a long time ago: it is false. Henry Moore has reinforced my conviction: a triangle, a square, a round may signify anthropomorphic forms. The female body may be transmuted into stones, grottoes, waves. The mystery of form is omnipresent in the work of Moore. This mystery is neither abstract nor figurative; this mystery is highly meaningful. His sculptures signify the mystery of life. Let those who have eyes, see it; let those who have hands, touch- so long as the museum attendant is not looking. With Gislebertus, Michelangelo, Rodin and Brancusi, Henry Moore is among the most vital of the great sculptors. Szekely, Henry Moore 317</page></plain_text>
