<plain_text><page sequence="1">Communication and Meaning: A Language-Action Synthesis Thomas B. Farrell and Thomas S. Frentz We are intrigued by a récent tendency in both philosophie and scientific research to disjoin conceptions of meaning from concep- tions of communication. Those schools of philosophy that assume a textual analogue for discovery make the most pronounced sépa- ration; as Hayden White noted: "The disparity between speech, lexis, or mode of utterance, on the one side, and meaning, on the other, is of course a fundamental tenet of modem Structuralist and post-Structuralist théories of the text. . . ,"1 In some branches of analytic philosophy as well, meaning is restricted to propositional content of sentences;2 communication is left for ex- périmental or therapeutic study. However, in neither philosophy nor the social sciences, hâve the results of such conceptual dis- junction been promising for the study of meaning. In the words of linguist Dennis Stampe: The concept of meaning is as dismayingly complex as any concept which suffers the attention of philosophy. So diverse and appar- ently miscellaneous are the sensés, uses, and meanings of the words mean and meaning that the very integrity of 'the concept of meaning' is subject to doubt.3 The failures of social science research in this area are understand- ably those of omission, and they hâve been explored elsewhere.4 In this essay, we suggest évidence that supports a restricted but alternate thesis: that some features of meaning are uniquely com- municative. This is to say that there are aspects of meaning for some fragments of discourse that can only be uncovered by con- sidering their fonctions as instances of communication. More- over, the exploration of communicative meaning should yield im- portant implications for scholarship in philosophy, aesthetics, and the social sciences.

Our fundamental conviction is that communication is amenable to a form that is neither mechanistic in configuration nor psychological in content. The form of com- munication is émergent from the rule-governed choices of agents, and is understood through the reasons, responsibilities, and func- tional possibilities of those who generate symbolic acts. Con- versely, this emerging form of communication - once identified - provides a contextual constraint upon the choices of communi- cants and, we will argue, the "meaning" of their actions. In pre- vious research,5 thèse assumptions were grouped together under the heading, language-action paradigm, and were applied to the criticism of an extended communication text. This study will first acknowledge some limits to related, but non-communicative con- ceptions of meaning. Then, we will 'deconstruct'6 the language- action paradigm, by applying our communication terminology to actual or Virtual examples of conversation; the resulting argument accounts for the génération and change of meanings through var- iations in concrete communicative usage. Convention and Intention From the many important conceptual relatives to the language- action paradigm, we hâve selected two conceptions of meaning especially pertinent to our own account: conventional and inten- tional théories. Not only do thèse approaches capture important dimensions of meaning that our perspective must accomodate. Moreover, as non-communicative approaches, convention and in- tention encounter limits to their explanatory power that our own account will supplément. We find that categorical semantic ac- counts of meaning must strain to encompass the larger range of meanings presented by actual performance. By instructive con- trast, psychological or dispositional accounts of meaning, in at- tending only to the internai states of actors, overlook or misplace the necessary constraint exerted by context.7 In examining, then, both the promise and limitations of contemporary approaches,</page><page sequence="3">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 217 we establish Substantive boundaries and requirements for our own inquiry. As the term itself suggests, conventions are either behavioral norms or semantic "essentials" that are recombined to produce definitional meanings for a given language. In the most basic linguistic practice, thèse fragments or éléments of meaning are reconstructed by the theorist according to proposi tional rules. The semantic use of conventions assumes that the meaning of a particular piece of language (usually a word) may be specified once two conditions are met: first, the essential semantic features of the word must be identified; second, the semantic rules that govern the "meaningful" combinations of words (in terms of these features) must be formulated. Figure 1 illustrâtes a repré- sentative conventional account of the semantic features for the word "bachelor."8 In addition to the distribution of semantic features noted above, such a conventional account of meaning would have to formulate propositional rules, constraining potential combinations of the word "bachelor" with other semantic features. One such rule might be the following: Non-male attributions may not be made with "bachelor. " This rule would block and define as anomalous sentences like, "The bachelor is pregnant." The principle contribution of convention to a theory of mean- ing is that it allows truth conditions to set boundaries for avail- able semantic combinations. In simply "ruling out" certain sen- tence constructions with the word "bachelor" as being without meaning, conventional analysis implies - correctly, in our view - that linguistic construction is constrained by outside logicai lim- its.9 Secret codes and in-group rituals notwithstanding, words, terms, discursive fragments have certain parameters that limit their semantic potential. Of course, without some such limits, any theory of meaning would be arbitrary, and every criticai interpré- tation hopelessly ambiguous.10 There is, however, a problem with the conventional theory of meaning that limits the theory 's own range of application. As a predominately non-communicative view, the conventional account has assumed that the propositional reconstruction of available</page><page sequence="4">218 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING bachelor ι noun (human) (animal) (maie) [who has (maie) the first \ \ lowest \ [who has never (young) académie (young) been married] degree] [knight [fur seal when serving without a mate under thè during thè standard of breeding time] another knight] Fig. 1. Conventional Account of Word Meaning sensés and referents not only limits, but also exhausts the very broad category of meaning. This difficulty can be detected even in those contemporary directions of semantic inquiry that give inter- pretative prominence to conventions. Austin's landmark study of language, How To Do Things With Words, broadened appreciably the performative nuances of language-use that might be open to philosophical analysis.11 Still, it was conventions alone that made the doing possible. Not surprisingly, Austin limited the term "meaning" to what he called locutionary acts; i.e., the proposi- tional statement of sensé and référence.12 Illocutionary acts did not have meaning, but rather "force." Locutionary acts could be true or false, whereas illocutionary acts could only be happy or unhappy.13 More recently, David K. Lewis has made an important</page><page sequence="5">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 219 attempt to repair and extend the concept of convention in his work, Convention: Λ Philosophie Study. But even the inclusion of reciprocai agreement, common knowledge, and awareness of com- mon interest does not extend the concept of meaning far beyond the analyticity of possible language use. Lewis' attempt to incorpo- rate game theory in his aecount employs games in which the par- ticipants cannot communicate.14 The treatment of communication itself is restricted to Systems that respond to "conventional sig- nais" (i.e., one if by land; two if by sea).15 Communication be- comes a process whereby predetermined chunks of meaning are put together to solve coordination problems. The major range of difficulties encountered by the conven- tional analysis of meaning is found in its neglect of temporal, personal, and circumstantial factors that often qualify "normal" or "typical" interprétations. Statements made under duress, with ironie intent, or without compréhension are all taken to "mean" the same thing as the identical utterance transcribed on the printed page. Although we acknowledge thè logicai constraint upon meaning that is exerted by conventions, our language-action perspective would not restrict meaning to what may be construeted in propo- sitions. Using Austin's terminology, we claim that the force of an utterance (illocutionary, perlocutionary, and "episodic"16) makes important contributions to the meaning of an utterance. More- over, it is thè concrete usage patterns of utterances that may yet explain eventual changes in semantic conventions. The conventional conception of meaning has been rivaled, in schools of analytic philosophy, by one not-too-distant counterpart: the intentional aecount. We will discuss this approach now be- cause, like conventions, the intentional interprétation has made prominent and important contributions to a discourse about mean- ing. Yet, although intentional theorists make no pretence of ex- hausting their subjeet,17 this approach also encounters problems and limits with which the language-action perspective must deal. The intentional view of meaning coneeives the utterance or gesture as a purposeful act. Accordingly, the "meaning" of any utterance or act requires someone's récognition of the purpose behind it. Once we have attributed (correctly, of course) the</page><page sequence="6">220 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING actor's own purpose to the action performed, then we hâve ar- rived at the action's meaning. While this simple formulation seems compatible with much intuitive expérience, the actual élaboration of felicity conditions18 may become quite complex. Consider, for instance, one of the more careful intentional ap- proaches to meaning - that of Grice. For Grice, S19 meaning is grounded in the intention of any speaker in uttering X, with the added (and also intentional) presumption that an audience, A, recognizes both (1) the speaker's intention in uttering X, and (2) the speaker's intention that his initial intention be recognized by an audience, A.20 If, as one illustration, the senior author were to inquire of the junior author, "Tom, when are you going to write your part of the manuscript?" with the intention of reminding the junior author that his contribution was overdue and with the added intention that the junior author recognize the first inten- tion (i.e. reminding), then meaning has occurred. Meaning thus dépends upon a recognizable reciprocity of intentions. The at- tempt to generalize meanings beyond particular pairs of "utter- ers" would apparently require some variation upon conventions (discussed above).21 The intentional account of meaning, though far from exhaus- tive, does highlight another important constituent in any ade- quate theory of language-use. In any conception of meaning that acknowledges thè primacy of personal choice, acts and utterances must be seen as serving certain purposes and implying responsi- bility.22 Intentional construals of meaning place both the bürden and the proof of interprétation upon the actors: i.e. the language- users themselves. Even on its own terms, however, the account of meaning offered by intentional approaches is of limited utility. Communi- cation is narrowly constricted to something that happens between highly conscious individuals. In addition to implying that ail meaningful acts - if communicative - are strategie, the intentional approach requires that they be instantaneous as well. But even supposing a supremely manipulative speaker, such manipulations as déception (requiring the suppression of first-order intentions) would be difficult to explain, if the audience is required to rec- ognize such an intent. The privileged status of the speaker, as the</page><page sequence="7">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 221 willful instrument of meaning, may also be questioned on intu- itive grounds.23 A severe limitation of thè intentional account is its neglect of unconscious dimensions to human interaction. A person at a party - who tells one increasingly crude and raunchy story after another - may not know his actual intentions. It is possible that, without consciously intending to, this person meant to attract attention to himself, express a deep-seated hostility toward women, and so on. Το press thè point, it is reasonable to say that a person may perform actions, express communication that is racist, sexist, and worse (or better) without e ver intending thèse "meanings" to be recognized. While we concur with intentional theorists that communicators, like other actors, should be held accountable for what they do, this is not to claim that only deliberate and conscious communica- tion is meaningful. The spoken utterance, once engendered, is a public artifact with acquired traits and functional properties that often elude thè author's wishes. These features of meaning should not elude thè theorist and critic. In conceding that motives and goals are often attributed to those who use discourse, the language-action perspective would also explain the manner in which discourse displays its own "intentionality,"24 and uses its practitioners. Language-action and Meaning The limits to conventional and intentional accounts of meaning provide necessary boundary conditions for our own project. Neither conventions, nor intentions - by themselves - are able to encompass the variations of meaning suggested by intuition.25 Our research tradition employs thè idea of the interaction and the exchange as central to an intervening construct of communi- cation.26 The social relationship of communication contextualizes and thus activâtes semantic conventions. Inversely, the dramatic construction of episodic utterance séquences seems both to ex- press and occasionally to override personal intentions. If the lan- guage-action view of communication allows us to extend and sup- plément thèse existing accounts, then we may conclude that the adequacy of meaning théories has been increased.</page><page sequence="8">222 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING The body of this essay explores and expands upon a proposition rooted in both ordinary language philosophy and communication pragmatics. The proposition maintains simply that the meaning of any utterance or symbolic act émerges through its use, rather than through logicai universals or personal motives (i.e. conventions or intentions) which are then said to characterize or identify the aet. Ryle has put it succinctly : "Learning the meaning of an expression is more like learning a piece of drill than like coming across a previously unencountered object. It is learning to operate cor- rectly with an expression and with any other expression équivalent to it."27 Curiously enough, the most obvious location for utterance "use" has been consulted but rarely; we refer to the active employ- ment of utterances in conversation. If it is true that discourse as conversational utterance "acts" differently than it would as con- vention or intention, then thèse différences may enhance our un- derstanding of meaning in communication. To provide conceptual focus for the range of "actional" mean- ing, we now introduce and examine a three-part diagrammale model of meaning levels. It will be noted first, that actional meaning (or communicative meaning) is an intervening range of usage contexts that mediate between intention and convention. The régulation of active use requires a second feature of the diagram; namely, communication rules that define parameters of choice for intelligible, pertinent, and functional symbolic acts. In each of several actional contexts (épisodes, encounters, and form-of-life), communication rules specify a domain of relevant application, and then stipulate or prescribe a species of required/ prohibited/permitted conduct. In practice, thèse rules and their contexts of application will often be overlapping. The hierarchy of contexts will be experienced by participants in communication as "ali of a piece." For the purpose of an interpretative under- standing, however, we "deconstruct" the paradigm of meaning levels, considering and illustrating the meaning functions of each rule type separately. Any utterance or symbolic act may perform multiple functions in a conversation, depending upon the rule-governed context from which it is viewed. The statement, "It's pretty cold in hère," could be viewed as an expression of intention (i.e. to let others know of</page><page sequence="9">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 223 Fig. 2. Language-Action Conception of Meaning one's discomfort). In this case, we would attribute a rule-governed means-ends relationship according to which, this utterance is held to be consciously purposeful. From the upward parameter of our diagram, it is possible to view this Statement as a proposition: a subject-predicate relationship with sensé and référence. Then we would approach the resulting combination as "a purely abstract entity. . ,"28 determined by rules of grammar and logic alone. However, thèse intentional and conventional readings do not be- gin to exhaust the possible meanings of our simple utterance ex- ample. If referred to the previous séquence of symbolic acts (and the realm of actional meaning known as episodic), it may be that this utterance performed unintended but necessary functions of topic shift and évasion in response to a séries of unpleasant con- frontational Statements (e. g. "Hey, I thought you said there were going to be girls at this party!"). On the level of encounter, this same utterance could be referred to features of the environment (social and otherwise) that are open to the common expérience of other communicants. For example, it may be that this is a dull party, and one of the actors is "saying so," metaphorically. This meaning could not be uncovered without référence to the en- counter situation itself. Finally, and with minimal additions, it is even possible to construe this same utterance as having what we</page><page sequence="10">224 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING shall term "form-of-life" meaning. It may be that the communi- cant in question is the Supervisor of an Company in which it is mandatory to maintain 78 degree températures during the "energy crisis." The same utterance which was viewed as a request, propo- sition, topic-shift, and metaphorical observation could also be viewed as an institutional sanction. Our point is that the interven- ing range of "actional meaning" is also governed by rules that supply a necessary adjunct to the more static and noncommunica- tive construals of meaning discussed so far. The center of our analysis discusses the multiplicity of functions that may be per- formed by discourse in conversation, along with the rules that govern the use of discourse. At each stage of analysis (épisode, encounter, and form-of-life), we contend that the function of the utterance contributes to its meaning. We begin with the minimal intelligible unit of language-action: the épisode. 1. Episodes. A récent and fairly typical Doonesbury comic strip offers an exchange over dinner between an employée and his boss. In thè first frame, thè boss is complaining: B: So what they're saying is that I tried to close a horse racing track at the bidding of an undisputed MOBSTER! Me, a former JESUIT, for God's sake! The employée is unconvinced: E: Is it true, boss? Β: Is what true? E: Is it true the fix was in? Β: They make a pretty fair taco here, don't you think? E: Boss. . . B: What's 'an undisputed mobster' really mean, anyway? Isn't that just a tired cliché?29 While the subtleties of humor traditionally defy analysis, it is the recognizable conversational équivalence of this strip that interests us. Were we to focus only on the remark, "They make a pretty fair taco here, don't you think?" much of the meaning of the utterance would be lost. But in typical conversational practice, we don't do this. This admittedly contrived example is an in- stance of an épisode, a mutually created séquence of symbolic acts, with recognizable form?0 Viewed in the context of persistent confrontational questioning by the employée, B's otherwise casu-</page><page sequence="11">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 225 al remark is (whether deliberately or not) an évasion. Perhaps, when one responds to a séries of direct confrontational questions with an unrelated séries of questions, one is - by rule-governed episodic définition - evading.The évidence is less than conclusive. But thè purpose of this portion of our discussion is to demon- strate that some features of actional meaning are governed by utterance functions within episodic rules. In order to appreciate this initial level of episodic meaning, it is necessary to explain and illustrate thè constraining function of episodic rules. Episodic rules are devices that mark an array of optimal or available séquence patterns among symbolic acts, given a context of previous utterance sélection for a certain épi- sode type. Unlike any other rules that sanction or guide commu- nication, episodic rules locate their conditional clause (or prota- sis) within a context of real or imagined utterance-act sequencing. The subjunctive (or apodosis) clause of episodic rules will usually specify both the form of the épisode and thè permissible or ap- propriate symbolic acts for the form in question.31 As our dia- gram suggests, episodic rules may be virtually inflexible, deriving from time-honored communication patterns or relational pecu- liarities. In addition to the familiär cases of communication ritual, there are also instances of people who "speak in short-hand," completing each others' sentences and so forth. But whatever the source of constraint within épisodes themselves, it is clear that each particular sélection acquires significance in terms of an emerging collective pattern of symbolic acts. Among the many complex problems of sequencing pertinent to the functions of episodic rules, we begin our illustrations with the remarkable fact of continuity itself in episodic structure. Grice has noted the ongoing character of conversation in a séries of well-known postulâtes: (1) that the participants hâve some common immediate aim. ... In characteristic talk-exchange there is a common aim even if, as in over-the wall chat, it is a second-order one, namely that each party should for the time being identify himself with the transitory inter- ests of the other. (2) that the contributions of the participants should be dovetailed, mutually dépendent. (3) that there is some sort of understanding (which may be explicit but which is often</page><page sequence="12">226 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING tarit) that, other things being equal, the transaction should continue in appropriate style unless both parties are agreeable that it should terminate.32 Yet thèse stipulations of convention seem to posit functional re- quirements without explaining their actual Implementation. A careful examination of episodic rules should reveal devices that regulate opportunités for individuai participation and transitional élaboration, in addition to guiding and sanctioning communica- tive performance. In short, the meaning of utterances may be found within their mode of constructing épisodes in addition to their external referents and internai relationships. One récent study of an episodic rule exemplifies this composi- tional dimension of meaning. Mary Jo Rudd's study of conversa- tions in Appalachia discovered an episodic rule that may well be applicable to a variety of conversational patterns - the rule of "third person referencing."33 According to Rudd, "third person référence," is a turn-allocation technique whereby an actual par- ticipant in ongoing conversation is referred to through the third person or indirect référence to name, rather than through direct address. The rule is stated as follows: ... the participant(s) referred to by a current speaker is con- strained from speaking in the next turn. Although conversational- ists may not be able to explicitly state this rule, as I hâve done, they regularly behave as if they know the rule. They recognize violations of the rule and hâve procédures for repairing the organ- izational séquence of turns when violations occur.34 Hère is one example from the many that Rudd provides: Billy: Susie, what are you doin? Susie: Drawin a picture. Billy: I believe she's finally started studyin a little bit. Papaw: Well, if she's ever gonna 'mount to anything it's 'bout time for her to git on the bail. Billy: I noticed last night she was gittin her rithmetic and her spelling - stayin right with it. Papaw: If she's gonna git her master's degree, she'd better be a gittin at it.</page><page sequence="13">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 227 Billy: What kind of grades did you make this six weeks, Susie? Susie: Fm gittin C's.35 Note, in this conversational example, that Susie is discusseci and referred to only in the 'third person' (where italicized). As a resuit of adhering to the rule, the other participants are able to exchange utterances and take turns, while including Susie only as a topic, rather than as a participant. Hère is an instance where the meaning of utterances may be found in their compositional functions for the structure and conti- nuity of conversational épisodes. The "third person référence" rule offers a clear stipulation of previous utterance sequencing, and spécifies a subséquent available array of communicative choices. In their elaborate and painstaking compliance with this rule, Billy and Papaw hâve been able to sanction Susie good- naturedly while off ering her indirect encouragement. We con- sider thèse uniquely episodic features of the utterances to be essential to their communicative meaning. Finally, it may be noted that the rule in question may be suspended or withdrawn through the consent of the parties to communication. As Rudd notes, Although the effect of 'third person' lapses after one transfer of speaking turns, the lapse does not require or obligate the previ- ously constrained participant to talk. If the participants allow the constraint upon one of their number to lapse and, in so doing, want to specifically sélect the previously constrained participant to speak next, a turn allocation technique such as an addressed ques- tion must be employed.36 In keeping with this last stipulation, Billy 's question to Susie ("What kind of grades did you make this six weeks, Susie?") may now be seen as functionally meaningful. While ostensively inquir- ing after information, it also reintroduces Susie as an active con- versational participant. Having demonstrated that utterances acquire communicative meaning through their rule-governed functions within épisodes, we now offer a preliminary characterization of that meaning generated and acquired by épisodes themselves. Episodic mean-</page><page sequence="14">228 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING ing is found not in distinguishable "contents" or entities, but rather in the interconnections that develop within episodic form. Although it seems appropriate to offer initial distinctions among episodic types and structural phases of sequencing patterns,37 the meaning "content" of most conversational épisodes is not monothetic; it cannot be "taken in at a glance."38 As Alfred Schutz noted, many a communicative event (as in his own ex- ample of a performed musical work) is best captured when it is, "... polythetically - that is, step by step - coperformed or re- performed by the récipient, and thus a quasi-simultaneity of both streams of thought takes place."39 While the analogue may seem indirect, the episodic form of any conversation seems to be - like the symphony - . . . essentially of a polythetical structure. It cannot be grasped monothetically. It consists in the articulated step-by-step occur- rence in inner time, in the very polythetic constitutional process itself. I may give a name to a spécifie piece of music, calling it 'Moonlight Sonata' or 'Ninth Symphony'; I may even say, 'These were variations with a finale in the form of a passacaglia,' or characterize, as certain program notes are prone to do, the par- ticular mood or émotion this piece of music is supposed to hâve evoked in me. But the musical content itself, its very meaning, can be grasped merely be reimmersing oneself in the ongoing flux, by reproducing thus the articulated musical occurrence as it unfolds in polythetic Steps in inner time, a process itself belonging to the dimension of inner time. And it will 'take as much time' to recon- stitute the work in recollection as to expérience it for the first time.40 [our emphasis above] From the perspective invoked by Schutz, it is evident that the meaning of épisodes dérives from a form that is polythetic and discursive, rather than monothetic and presentational.41 More- over, the unique quality of episodic meaning may be captured through the episodic rules that allocate and structure the "inner time" of communicants themselves. Erving Goff man, for instance, has characterized the "content" of most talking as being the présent display of past expérience. In Frame Analysis, he writes:</page><page sequence="15">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 229 . . .what thè individuai spends most of his spoken moments doing is providing évidence for thè fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approvai, exonération, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appréciation. They are to be stirred not to take action but to exhibit signs that they hâve been stirred. For what a speaker does usually is to présent for his listeners a version of what happened to him.42 In granting Goffman's suggestive observation, we leave unre- solved the seemingly massive problem of choreographing the temporal progression among épisodes themselves, orderly procé- dures for sequencing among communicants, and équitable oppor- tunities for performance and exchange. To uncover thèse struc- tural déterminants of communicative meaning, extraordinary reli- ance must be placed upon episodic rules. Through the use of such rules, the inner time of communication is allocated and guided - however unconsciously - by the actors themselves. A typically structured social conversation should illustrate the complexities of temporal sequencing, in addition to dramatizing the elusiveness of predetermined meaning "contents". A social grouping of acquaintances might initiate with warm, but ritual- ized acknowledgement of the présent encounter ("Nice to see you!" "How are you?" "Welcome!"). It would then be likely to progress through thè mutuai allocation of turns for présent dis- play and recitation of past expérience (i.e. "Bringing up-to- date"), eventually moving to the proposai of forthcoming actions ("Well, would you two be up for a movie, or what?") or the response to preconceived temporal constraints ("Dinner is almost ready."). The phase of task-completion, if it is to be included hère, will occasionally demand even multiple overlapping épi- sodes (i.e. the combination of business and pleasure) with accom- panying sanctions ("Don't talk shop!"). With the conclusion of the gathering, special formulale options include professing mutuai gratification, and the proposai of vague-to-specific subséquent plans. Now if the rules governing the temporal progression and distri- bution of an episodic séries are also structural déterminants of</page><page sequence="16">230 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING meaning, the meaning "content" of thèse spoken moments may be much more complex than Goff man allows. Indeed, the social gathering apparently moves from reportage of past expérience to plans for future social expérience - without ever dwelling upon the présent expérience of conversation itself . It is interesting that episodic rules appear to move over the présent to the point that leave-taking rituals refer to the conversational expérience as a past event ("Gee, this has been fun. We'll hâve to do it more often.") Conversational practice itself seems to subordinate the search for defined meaning "content" to the continuai élabora- tion and extension of episodic structure. Although we suspect that meaning in conversation is guided by a finite number of episodic rules, thèse cannot ail be enumerated hère. It should suffice to off er two spécifie examples of "inner time" allocation through the use of episodic rules, and to illus- trate the dimension of meaning that results. First, consider the relatively formai gathering in which - after judicious turn-taking - there is a lull in the conversation. One of the participants pops up with, "Gee, that was a long silence!" or, "I guess we don't hâve much to say tonight." The results are easy to imagine. After awkward stammers, several people will race to speak at once, with evident embarrassment. There has been, in short, a conversational misfire. In formai social settings, one epi- sodic rule seems to sanction negatively any disparaging référence to the présent conversational performance of communicants. To question the narrow integers of conversational meaning is appar- ently to dévalue the larger form. The rule seems more flexible for positive referencing; individuai performance may be praised ("Hey, you put that really well! Mind if I steal it?"). Still, posi- tive références for collective conversational performance are usu- ally reserved for retrospection ("Gee, this has been a good con- versation. We should talk about aesthetics more often."). The positive référence to collective conversational performance seems disturbing located in the présent tense. To use an exaggerated example: "Gosh, Dean, this evening is going really well! We were nervous as hell about you coming over!" Perhaps this awk- ward finality dérives from the tension of interrupting émergent structural meaning only to comment upon the more limited mo-</page><page sequence="17">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 231 mentary séquence of utterances; but, whatever the reason for its constraint, the rule seems generalizable. The complexity of inner time allocation also requires positive episodic rules that off er an array of transitional procédures. One of the most important of these is what we might term a rule of reduplication, Since many épisodes and most conversations re- quire some référence to utterances and remarks already made earlier in time, there are - as might be expected - more or less optimal ways of reduplicating previous utterances. The rule seems to require that an earlier utterance will only be repeated if (1) it has some renewed pertinence to présent episodic develop- menty or (2) if its significance has been enhanced due to subsé- quent episodic development. In complying and in deviating from this rule, the utterances of communicants acquire episodic struc- ture and meaning. Here are two relevant examples; first, A and Β are driving through a stränge section of town: A: "Where did you say this bar was, again?" B: "Relax, we should see it in a couple blocks." Second, C and D (after a lengthy discussion of bureaucratie inep- titude) continue: C: "Ah yes, speaking of Dean Lewis, what was that you were saying earlier about the Peter principle?" D: "(laughter) Yeah, you can say that again." In each of the above cases, information already shared is reintro- duced. Without knowing the actual situation, we are yet able to "read between the Unes," and make the assumption that there is renewed or cumulating significance to be gained by each instance of reduplication. In following the rule, then, the participants at- tend to their own episodic progress, even as earlier utterances expand in meaning. When the rule of reduplication is violated, the conséquences are confusion and yet another conversational misfiring. Suppose several acquaintances are engaged in social conversation: E (to F): "How old are you again, David?" F: "31." E: "Oh." Now perhaps this little exchange would simply be by-passed through topic shift, or reallocation of turns. If not, however, F is</page><page sequence="18">232 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING likely to wonder whether he looks older than his years, is behav- ing immaturely, or whatever. In other words, violation of the reduplication rule has caused confusion. Reduplication, there- fore, is more than a conversational formality; it is a way of pro- viding order and guidance to the growth of episodic meaning. Thus far, we hâve examined the minimal intelligible unit of communication, the épisode, in order to illustrate some initial features of actional meaning. Meaning was seen to be acquired through the functions of utterances within episodic séquence, as well as through the structural constraint exerted by episodic form. Rules of évasion, third-person référence, temporal by-pass, and reduplication were explained and exemplified to demonstrate that meaning has distinct and recognizable episodic constituents. 2. Encounters. While the variety of rules and enactment patterns discussed above suggest a construct of considérable adaptive range, an important dimension of actional meaning remains out- side the compass of episodic rules. The most intimate disclosures about one's sex life hâve a différent meaning in a therapeutic encounter group than they would hâve, say, on a bus or in an anonymous late night phone cali. One fundamental constituent of actional meaning is supplied by thè concrete communication envi- ronment in which épisodes are enacted. We refer to this contex- tual dimension of language-action as the encounter. Although communicants will often enact épisodes in order to suspend or re-label encounter définitions, some référence to time and space seems both unavoidable and important to our emerging concep- tion of meaning. In an earlier project, encounters were defined as the spatio- temporal context of communication.43 Spatially, they were viewed as points of contact for communicants found in physical locations where actors converge. Temporally, encounters were the intersubjective expérience of mutuai présence over time. Ré- cent important research, however, has offered an intriguing qualification to this initial conception: notably, an emphasis upon the prior necessity of commonality in situational définition, if encounter-types are to take hold among communicants.44 For many communication exchanges, the encounter orientation of each participant (what Goffman terms "frame")45 will be as im-</page><page sequence="19">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 233 portant to the formation of meaning as thè physical environment encompassing the épisodes themselves. The füll implications of this spéculation are beyond the scope of the présent study; but it may be that shifts in encounter orientation anticipate more basic changes among encounter types. Το understand both person and object attachments with respect to piace, however, it is helpful to consult the functions performed by encounter rules in the généra- tion of actional meaning. Encounter rules are constructs that demarcate types of possible communication exchange, given the indexical and situational de- mands of place. The protasis (or conditional clause) of such rules refers to a particular set of circumstances or encounter-type (for example, a cocktail party, an interview, an obscène phone cali). The apodosis (or subjunctive clause) of an encounter rule usually spécifies a range of experiential subjects and/or épisodes perti- nent, permissable, or obligatory for the encounter-type in ques- tion. In the following exposition of encounters, we will enlarge the range of actional meaning to include the privacy of expérience (and its disclosure), the indexical expression, and the proprieties and ironies of utterance-environment relationships. The most important initial encounter feature of meaning is the privacy constraints upon expérience that is shared. There is, we suspect, a tendency to reconsider the attributed "significance" of candid information that is shared with us, once we begin to hear the "same" information shared with everyone eise. An obvious example is our practice of devaluing the "illusory intimacy" that appears in televised talk shows. As thè celebrity's "personal se- crets" are being shared with sixty million persons other than one- self, the conversation is likely to appear more programmed than "real." Encounter rules hâve the first function, then, of distin- guishing between expérience that may be made public and expéri- ence that should remain private - for a given encounter setting. The conspicuous préoccupation of our culture with "meaning- ful" communication has been accompanied by a rieh assortment of encounter rules designed to fester relational intimacy and "growth." Works in the "self-help" genre hâve tried to offer print-oriented consultation about the optimal rules for sharing personal expérience.46 The irony should not be lost that as thèse</page><page sequence="20">234 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING works adapt and change encounter rules, the experiential mean- ing thèse rules would guide is also changed. In thè late 1970's, for instance, suggested encounter rules for relationships between parents and children could be found on bumper stickers, and the most imaginative variations upon courtesy rules ("Knock before entering.") could be found printed on tee-shirts.47 Yet most social institutions, healthy or not, provide accessible modes for communication encounters - complete with rules al- lowing for the transformation of private expérience. And in such institutionally sanctioned encounter-types, physical place and en- counter définition seem equally important influences upon the meaning that émerges. Consider the confessional. Hère is a most remarkable encounter-type, where relational patterns seem rooted in both the shared institutional convictions of Catholicism and thè austere solitude of the confessional "box" itself. In the confessional encounter, two people approach each other in sitting and kneeling positions respectively. They are separated by a slid- ing wooden screen and shrouded in darkness. The atmosphère is one of imposed anonymity , and yet confidentiality as well; presum- ably, this is to project encounter meanings of "shame" upon the sinful message, while yet protecting the identity of the supplicant. The rules of confessional govern ail aspects of the encounter, beginning with the greeting itself ("Bless me, father, for I hâve sinned. It has been seventeen years since my last confession. (Pause). And hère are my sins. . .").48 The pénitent must then share previous instances of reprehensible behavior (sin) with the Virtual stranger who listens, blesses, prescribes, issues punitive sanctions and ritually forgives. Encounter rules, in short, deter- mine and structure a most unusual transformation of private ex- périence into significant communicative exchange. Paradoxically, a person who abides religiously by divine and human rules would violate the rules of the confessional encounter by having nothing e vil to confess and disclose. So important are encounter rules in the génération of meaning within the confessional that even minor déviations appear hu- morous. In a récent film comedy, "The End," Burt Reynolds enacts a character who, having been told of his terminal illness, décides to return to confession after a lengthy absence.49 While</page><page sequence="21">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 235 in church, he encounters what must be thè world's youngest priest who - despite some inexpérience (it will be the priest's first actual performance of his duties) - agrées to hear Reynold's confession. So far, so good. But Reynolds and the priest change one encounter rule. Since the priest is so young, and Reynolds feels older by the minute, he will address the priest on a first- name basis. "Bless me, Dave," he begins - and so much for anonymity, seclusion, and supplication. The very informality usually deemed essential for intimate disclosure seems ludicrous in this one encounter setting. In addition to marking off a range of meaning in the settings for public expression of expérience, encounter rules define rele- vance criteria for utterances that refer to situation or setting. Rhetorically, utterances that refer directly to the immediacy of place are known as indexical (or, in Habermas' word, "deic- tic").50 An example would be an expression like: "You, who share this hot stuffy room with me, will understand what I mean by discomfort." This indexical dimension of encounter meaning (the dependence upon and référence to physical setting) assumes special relevance whenever one rationalizes a striking departure from custom. At one récent party the junior author attended, the rather formal proceedings had reached a hiatus when, among several bored onlookers, introductions were begun. As one woman was being introduced to another, she remarked as she extended her hand, "I know women aren't supposed to shake hands, but under the circumstances, I feel better doing it." The immediate resuit of this act was laughter that seemed to under- score thè formality of thè party itself . If the act in question is construed as a minor violation of the greeting ritual, it may be rationalized and acquire meaning as a commentary on the actual encounter setting. Hère again, typical usages hâve been ex- panded in meaning through référence to immediate encounter contexts. A third important meaning function of encounter rules is to dramatize the relationship between professed institutional practice and actual encounter setting. Traditionally, the discrepancies and incongruities between conventional practice and the immediacy of encounter context hâve offered the major sources of irony and</page><page sequence="22">236 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING paradox in communicative meaning. Consider the importance of encounter context in the following rather complex exchange among Studs Terkel and a group of social anthropologists: Terkel: Isn't this one of the - Please. I would rather we keep this open to anyone. If something Saul said touches something off, go ahead. Tedlock: History is, or has been anyway until now, let's say, written by people who wear neckties. It is hard for us to take our neckties off. We're ail wearing them as a matter of fact. Vansina: It's conventional. Harris: I'm not. (laughter) Tedlock: You're not. Terkel: That reveals something of Dennis Tedlock to you. Harris: Exactly. Tedlock: Indeed. It also reveals again, that what I said is cor- rect. History was written by people who wore neckties. Terkel: Yes, of course.51 Now hère is an exchange that initiâtes a metaphorical utterance pertaining to the anachronistic institutional practices within the field of history. Tedlock's comment, however, calls forth his own realization that he and several others are actually wearing neckties; it is an explicit indexical référence that he uses to underscore his point. The reply, "It's conventional," seeks to validate "tie-wearing" (read: "anachronistic history") as conven- tional. Harris' retort, "I'm not," refers again to the setting; it may be read, "I'm not (1) wearing a tie; (2) conventional." Of relevance to both readings, it was no doubt noted that Harris is Alice Kessler Harris, a woman. Terkel's awareness of the en- counter incongruity, "That reveals something of Dennis Tedlock to you," may thus be read as a gentle jab at Tedlock's sexism. Tedlock, however, recovers from his faux pas, and adroitly brings the exchange back to a füll, if oblique, circle, by référ- ence both to his original metaphor and its newly acquired en- counter meaning: "It also reveals again, that what I said is correct. History was written by people who wore neckties."52 The meaning of this exchange, while not exceptionally pro-</page><page sequence="23">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 237 found, would be virtually unfathomable without some référence to thè encounter context. As a final qualification to the importance of encounters in ac- tional meaning, it should be noted that not all meaningful irony and paradox is therefore intentional. In fact, so pervasive is the ironie style in the présent era that the gifted partieipant-observer need only chronicle the discrepancy between alleged life-style affiliation and explicit encounter context to achieve ironie impact. Benjamin Stein, in his autobiographical ode to Los Angeles, Dreemz, Claims to have observed the following communicative behavior at a bourgeois Hollywood party held to raise money for migrant workers: Our host, a writer who has won many awards and has houses in at least two European countries in addition to two in L.A., opened up a silver Mark Cross cigarette case, and removed a custom-made Sherman cigaretter. His man-servant lit it with a deferential bow and a gold cigarette lighter. Our host ran a hand through his graying locks and exhaled from his cigarette. Ί just thought Fd say,' he said, with a meaningful look, 'right here at thè beginning that we are all outlaws in the eyes of the Establishment.'53 In this passage, of course, Stein's own irony can hardly be con- strued as unintentional. But even without the intervention of Stein's prose, anyone présent at thè party might have detected unintentional irony in the wealthy writer's pronouncements. It is the conflict between rules of encounter implied by the setting, and the actual expressions of affiliation by communicants that supplies the central focus to any such construal. Encounter rules, in summary, pro vide flexible démarcations between publically communicable and private expérience, define situational conditions for indexical relevance, and provide grounds for rationalizing or undermining the compatibility of ac- tual setting and personal display. As we have seen, each of these funetions may, at one time or another, contribute important com- municative features to actional meaning. 3. Forms of life. Our primary contention has been that some</page><page sequence="24">238 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING aspects of meaning are distinctly communicative. More specifi- cai ly, we hâve introduced a range of meaning called "actional" describing the pragmatic communicative functions of symbolic acts. So far we hâve illustrateci two sources for this actional meaning: the rules governing available sequencing patterns for épisodes, and the rules governing personal and public propriety and relevance for encounter contexts. It remains to be demon- strated that there are important socio-cultural dimensions of com- munication that make unique contributions to an understanding of meaning. We refer to this most generai contextual parameter of actional meaning as "form of life." In an earlier discussion, form of life was defined as a partially linguistic and partially non-linguistic constellation of social practices that fixed the uses of concepts and expressions.54 We suggested further that form of life possessed epistemic, aesthetic, and institutional features. To show how form of life rules expand upon the array of meanings in communication, it is again necessary both to extend and to qual- ify our previous observations. For the purposes of understanding actional meaning, form of life is simply that range of cultural expérience that members of a given social sphère hold in common. Now this range may be dictated by material conditions, ethnicity, heredity, child-rearing history, or psychological conversion; our point is that it is recog- nized through communication, whatever its variable root causes. The form of life of Catholicism (complete with the dualities of body and soûl, life and after-life, an anthropomorphic God, and personal responsibility for conscious and unconscious "conduct") provides an absolutely integral horizon for the meanings that emerge in the confessional encounter. The académie discipline of history - although perhaps more perméable to the influence of its subject matter than Catholicism - provides an equally identifi- able range of linguistic and non-linguistic practices that helps to inforni the commentary of Terkel and colle agues. And surely Benjamin Stein's largely Stereotypie depiction of liberal bour- geois Hollywood wealth was meant to "frame" the subséquent ironies of affiliation and encounter setting. In ail of thèse ex- amples, we suggest merely that one's communicative utterances may bespeak a range of outside socio-cultural affiliations that</page><page sequence="25">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 239 escape thè conscious attention of thè communicants. And even thèse "traces" of the larger community of discourse comprise important features of actional meaning. Form of life rules, while rarely verbalized in explicit inferential reconstruction, nonetheless constrain this most enlarged domain of communicative significance. The conditional clause of form of life rules (protasis) delimits a range of expérience that may - in principle - be represented by some manner of speech; the sub- junctive clause of form of life rules would delimit verbal and non-verbal practices that provide use-value to the range of expé- rience delimited conditionally. More than a "vocabulary," then, form of life rules comprise a praxis; i.e. a rule-governed System of thought and action.55 In the discussion that follows, we will illustrate three fonctions of form of life rules for the génération of meaning: as a range of usage, a range of knowledge, and a range of compétence and commitment. Form of life rules prescribe the allowable functions of commu- nicative acts on this most generai level of context. The most typical and ordinary function of form of life rules is to delimit or expand the availability of usage patterns for potential semantic meanings. Returning to an example we employed in discussing conventions, it is evident that contemporary American form of life rules would prohibit the usage of thè word "bachelor" to denote a young seal without a mate during the breeding season, because this particular potential of thè word has become archaic. And it is for this reason that few persons would find the utter- ance, "The bachelor's coat is shiny," to be radically ambiguous. Even in the ordinary function of enlarging usage patterns, there is an often overlooked change in the resulting "world view." For instance, récent form of life usage has inverted ex- pressions from a technological ontology to suggest decreasing control and direction in the personal world. The almost mystical concept of "black holes" in space was meaningless until given an officially-sanctioned "name." Once the form of life usages were determined, such typical expressions as "negative energy," per- sonal "inertia," "burned out," "wasted," "on the edge," and others too numerous and apocalyptic to mention began to assume an ominous social significance. Catastrophe theory is another ex-</page><page sequence="26">240 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING ample of technical vocabulary and personal idioms developing almost simultaneously.56 Hère again, the prospect of technical anticipation and control is translated in the social sphère as per- sonal victimization. Form of life rules, and their accompanying range of meaning, imply an epistemic dimension as well. In experiencing a similar history, with events of similar magnitude, the members of a com- mon culture must be assumed to hâve "knowledge," of their common expérience.57 Yet, like the other features of our para- digm, the knowledge of a speech Community can not be assumed to be conscious and accessible to immediate reflection. Rather than being a cultural "neurosis," as some have suggested,58 this condition may simply be a time-honored social norm. The knowledge of form of life rules and practices is a tacit, rather than an explicit awareness. The doctrine of Social Darwinism no doubt circumscribed the meanings of many nineteenth-century commu- nication events, without the communicants themselves being ex- plicitly aware of this fact.59 The limits imposed by the closing of the frontier in that Century, just as the foreboding involution wrought by the atom bomb in our çentury, have fore ver altered the tacit ground-rules for meaning in communication, whether or not we consciously attend to them. The attempt to establish and confirm form of life limits for historical utterances is the responsi- bility of rhetorical history; and some important strides have al- ready been made in that direction.60 For our own purposes, it would be sufficient to chronicle the form of life parameters for a contemporary pattern of communica- tion exchange. Our discussion of encounter rules made référence to a conspicuous préoccupation with the "growth," "health," and self-sufficiency of intimate interpersonal relationships in thè late 1970's. There is, however, a rieh and suggestive history of graduai évolution in the relational direction suggested by this essay. In the late 1960's, for instance, Lee Rainwater's important study, "Fear and the House-as-Haven in the Lower Class," noted: There is in our culture a long history of the development of the house as a place of safety from both nonhuman and human threats, a history which culminâtes in guaranteeing the house, a</page><page sequence="27">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 241 man's castle, against unreasonable search and seizure. The house becomes the place of maximum exercise of individuai autonomy, minimum conformity to the formal and complex rules of public demeanor. The house acquires a sacred characteristic from its complex intertwining with the seif and from the symbolic character it has as a représentation of the family.61 Rainwater also disco vered, in extensive interview sessions, that the lower class tended to view the home as a "shelter," whereas the upper middle classes, and the upper classes tended to view their homes as "conveniences" and Symbols of "achievement," respectively.62 These localized form of life rules were given some limited sub-cultural validity in Gerald Suttles' study of thè ghetto neighborhoods, The Social Order of thè Slum. Suttles found that constructs like, "rôle," "value," "norm," were all defined through personal relationships, with power equaling both legiti- macy and protection simultaneously.63 Whether hazards or social sensitivity have increased in intervening years, it is interesting that Christopher Lasch defines the family of thè late 70's as both a relational model and a "haven" in a heartless world.64 The form of life is privatism, a cultural phenomenon with its own precon- ceptions about expérience that may be shared, and also a stoical conception of relational optimality. The relationship, in short, is thè definitional ground of all values, and thè protective buffer against an increasingly treacherous world.65 One need not ac- knowledge the superior moral authority of this form of life to sense its historical power in dictating and thus explaining the unusual hybrid forms of communication exchange that we have considered. The very generalizability of privatistic rules implies their social significance. Finally, form of life rules allow for a range of meaning that can be captured in neither the idiosyncrasies of episodic patterns, nor the fixations of encounter proprieties. Here, we refer to the por- tentous fact that people take static intentions and conventions and, by "speaking" them, bring them into active existence.66 The enormity of this outer range of meaning has prompted the discov- ery, by several theorists, of an ideality grounding even the most spécifie utterance in assumptions of universal significance. In The Prose of the World, Merleau-Ponty wrote:</page><page sequence="28">242 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING In the living expérience of speech there is really a répétition of ail preceding expérience, an appeal to the fulfillment of language, a presumptive eternity. But this appeal is made the way the per- ceived object gives us the expérience of being in the very moment that it sketches, in the évidence of the présent, the outline of an expérience and the presumption of an endless future that would confirai it. . . Moreover, we should be sensitive to the thread of silence from which the tissue of speech is woven. In expressions already habituai, there is a direct meaning which corresponds point by point to the established phrases, forms, and words. Pre- cisely because thèse expressions are habituai, the gaps and élément of silence are obliterated.67 Given their normative grounding of meaning in use, form of life rules construct a fabric of commitment implicit in every commu- nicative utterance that occurs in "good faith." The most rigorous depiction of rules related to this "outer" parameter of meaning cornes from Habermas. According to Thomas McCarthy, Haber- mas' "conditions for ideal discourse are connected with condi- tions for an ideal form of life."68 The conditions themselves are enlarged versions of Gricean maxims: the ideal expectations that the utterance be understandable, the propositional content true, the speaker sincere, and thè act itself appropriate.69 The general- ity of Habermas' own interests (in truth, right, and justice) can be questioned only insofar as thèse interests may transcend the mundane concern with concrete changes in the practice of com- munication, changes which may hâve eventual relevance to thèse larger interests. What may be inferred from the conditions of ideality dis- cussed thus far is that conditions of an optimal form of life also furnish rules for compétence within a speech community. With- out disputing this fact, it may yet be noted that form of life rules pose unusual rhetorical problems for the theorist and prac- titioner. Commitment to form of life rules seems to demand one's tacit acknowledgement, while ruling out explicit reflection. Some sensé of objective detachment may be a necessary prereq- uisite to thè criticai reconstruction of communication meaning (the theorist's task); but this same detachment is lethal to the rhetorical advocate. This problem may be illustrated through two examples. In our first example, feminist, and editor of Ms.</page><page sequence="29">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 243 Magazine, Gloria Steinern addressed an audience of advertising executives. Instead of addressing and acknowledging the prevail- ing "form of life" for this cultural group, Ms. Steinern intro- duced an alternative: In the beginning, there was a gynecocracy. I would now like to suggest to you that the social order we see around us now is neither thè naturai one, nor the only one that human beings have achieved - that for the first half of human history, it's likely that there was a gynecocracy, not a matriarchy which imitated patriar- chy and came later, but a gynecocracy which meant that women were the first class Citizens, that women were considered superior beings, and that they were worshipped as goddesses. In fact, we see residual women goddesses in most of the great religions.70 While Steinem's speech did not demand acceptance of this alter- native form of life, thè rhetorical problems are evident nonethe- less. Viewed as a text, her Statement could be read within the quite sensible fabric of form of life meanings with which she affiliât ed. Read as a speech, however, her Statement would most probably find its meaning in a disavowal of her audience's own somewhat questionable form of life. It is almost as if Steinem's very prowess as an analytic historian had devalued her advocacy. An even more récent case documents the attempt to critique and transcend the public's form of life. Few could deny that the privatism and fragmentation of social interests tends to yield a distinct (and anomic) contemporary cultural environment.71 If this is true (and our examples would suggest that it is), any attempt to confront and reflect upon this "form of life" within an avowedly rhetorical stance would seem reduced to one of two unhappy options: radical ambiguity or social disaffiliation. Within this internai tension of form of life, then, hère are some strong words from President Carter's energy address of July 15, 1979: . . .1 have been reminded again that ail the législation in the world can't fix what's wrong with America. . . .It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soûl and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation. The érosion of</page><page sequence="30">244 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and politicai fabric of America.72 While the historical impact of thèse words cannot be foretold, the discursive distance with the "meaning" of the speech itself is striking. Within the very diagnosis of the national crisis is an unavoidable dissociation of consciousness. A President, after all, cannot lose confidence in the future and doubt the meaning of his own life; it is not part of the job description. In attending, elo- quently enough, to this malaise of form of life, the advocate also withdraws from it, becoming a victim of the very fragmentation he would cure. It is our firm conviction, then, that form of life meaning must extend beyond thè generai parameters of compétence to the con- straints of conviction exerted by actual usage. It is, of course, the province of philosophy to explain and critique form of life pre- suppositions. Dialectic, long before its historié and linguistic turns, was - most fundamentally - an optimal mode of interper- sonal communication. In the analysis of form of life, we hâve only been able to "allude" to rules that constrain this broadest range of meaning within communication. From the outline of examples offered, we may conclude that form of life rules provide constraint upon actual patterns of usage, stipulate a range of tacit knowledge, and finally specify conditions of compétence and conviction for those who engage in speech. Yet, one qualification is in order. We are not claiming that all expositions of actional meaning must make conscious référence to form of life rules. This examination sug- gests instead that any utterance or communicative exchange - however minimal - may be examined from the enlarged meaning context or horizon supplied by form of life. Despite the attention devoted to rules in the enlargement of actional meaning, conversation is not simply a process of ratioci- nation writ large. Contrary to some interprétations of language- action, the several levels of communicative rules are not simply a blueprint or deductive filter for the transformation of utterance fragments into rigorous intelligibility. In fact, communication practice often distinguishes between good and poor conversation-</page><page sequence="31">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 245 alists, while offering aesthetic judgments of communication qual- ity. There is thus no inconsistency between the reliance upon rules and the attribution or "présence" of aesthetic properties in conversation. Given the prominence of the conversational aes- thetic in selected historical periods,73 a workable analogy to our view of conversation may be found in classical dramatic theory. Both tragedy and comedy were able to achieve their form by following certain rules. Yet if rules are followed creatively, the resulting structure may be said to possess distinct aesthetic pro- perties: symmetry, unity, completeness, multidimensionality, and so on.74 Analogously, any communicative utterance or épisode may be appreciated for both its adhérence to episodic, encounter, and form of life rules, as well as for its contribution to the aes- thetic properties of conversational form. Some Implications Now that we have deconstructed and illustrated the various actional levels of meaning, it is possible to draw conclusions and off er implications pertinent to several areas of continuing inquiry. Central to all of thèse implications, however, is the thesis of this study: that there is a range of variation in meaning that is uniquely communicative. If this is so, then there are important implications for the study of meaning change in philosophie se- mantics, for the appréciation of style and form in aesthetics, and for the expansion of research methods in social inquiry. An initial implication of our research would be to suggest that communicative fonctions of utterances may aid in understanding semantic change. In moving away from the stasis of linguistic conventions and through a contextual hierarchy that attends to a range of shifting use patterns, the interpréter of communication may anticipate graduai changes in outward semantic potential. Consider, as one ordinary illustration of possible semantic shift, the following conversational segment from a two-hour videotaped session among six undergraduate college students: A: Do you think there should be some other things? B: Yeah, I think teachers should be screened. Don't you think this money-oriented trip, I mean money is a problem?</page><page sequence="32">246 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING C: You've got to hâve money; how do you expect to get good teachers? B: Well that's right. But when they sit around and picket and aren't interested in students . . . C: (interrupting) . . . trying to . . . A: (interrupting) She's not saying no money, just dorit get people who ONLY care for the money. We need some sort ofgrass roots change in the values. B: Yeah, that's what grass roots change, yeah. . . . (Collective Laughter) A: So you don't hâve people going into it just because they can't do anything else. I don't know how we could do that. B: Or just people who kind of I like kids so I want to be a good teacher. A: Yeah.75 Now if we were to interpret the meanings of this fragment, a number of possible approaches suggest themselves. From the per- spective of a simple associational model, for instance, B's itali- cized comment may be seen as partial confirmation of the preced- ing utterance (linking grass roots change to value change). If, however, we include within our considération the épisode and encounter levels of meaning, we are reminded that this is a task- oriented class discussion examining thè quality of teaching in col- lege. Moreover, the episodic séquence immediately preceding the italicized section is clearly confrontational in structure. Composi- tionally, then, B's italicized statement fonctions to defuse poten- tial conflict, while allowing A to confess some uncertainty on the practical implications of his earlier remarks (i.e. "I don't know how we could do that."). However, from the language-action view, the most interesting semantic aspect of B's italicized comment remains unexplained: why did it elicit laughter from the other five actors? This incon- gruity may be resolved on the form of life level, where one cul- turally spécifie use of thè word "grass" is its association with the drug, marijuana. In and of itself, this discovery is less than star- tling. But in response to a somewhat faded idiom from the Sixties ("We need some sort of grass roots change in the values."),76 a dimension of rieh metaphoric ambiguity is added to B's com-</page><page sequence="33">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 247 ment, which might be read, "Hey, grass roots (i.e. marijuana) sure do change values!" In addition to gently punning (and punc- turing) A's little dogma, thè remark relieves tension, allowing for subséquent disclosure. If the communicative use of expressions and utterances may be said to qualify conventional semantic meaning, then perhaps the meaning/use of "grass-as-marijuana" is about to become a con- ventional fixture of semantic potential. One illustration can hardly be definitive. But as research continually shifts away from "word counting" in content analysis,77 the language-action para- digm may provide an alternative categorical schema for the func- tional analysis of semantic change. On a less immediate level, récent scholarship has evinced a growing interest in the rôle and meaning of "concepts" them- selves in humanities inquiry.78 Yet despite the reminders of John- stone and others that even speculative dialogue has communica- tive features,79 no one has examined the functional dimensions of concept-use in actual communication contexts. Concepts in reli- gion, art, and social ethics acquire meanings through actual com- munication that are usually neglected in favor of their abstract properties. Although favoring an avowedly hermeneutic stance, Karl-Otto Apel seems to hâve anticipated our preferred alterna- tive in his important essay, "The A Priori of Communication": One could hère, perhaps, follow the later Wittgenstein and take it as a heuristic horizon that speech, actions and interprétations as meaning-intentions are always 'interwoven' in language-games as 'forms of life.' One might thus be led to think that the historians had to inquire into actions, institutions, etc., in a way similar to that in which philologists inquire into texts, in order to understand forms of life by interpreting the meaning of the goal-setting and the value-systems expressed by actions and institutions.80 A second important implication of the présent project has been to broaden the prospect of an aesthetic interprétation of meaning within communicative contexts. In the somewhat amorphous field of communication study, aesthetic modes of reconstruction hâve been reserved traditionally for rhetoric and public address. But if traditional aesthetic features like order, progression, symmetry</page><page sequence="34">248 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING (characteristics of "form") are pertinent to the expérience and description of conversation, then traditional constructs and de- vices within stylistics and aesthetics may make substantial contri- butions to a füll élaboration of actional meaning - even on an interpersonal level. As two examples of aesthetic constructs that are central to a füll explication of actional meaning, we now consider metaphor and metonymy. Classical rhetoric tended to regard metaphor as a non-intrinsic relationship grounded in asserted resemblance.81 Through paral- lel substitution, figurative meaning replaces "literal meaning," which could typically be employed in the same place. Yet Paul Ricoeur has suggested that metaphor might be given a useful contemporary turn, if its creative tension is found not in opposed terms, "but rather between two opposed interprétations of the utterance."82 In the analysis offered thus far, we hâve seen sev- eral cases where an initial enigma of conversation became, through metaphor, a semantic innovation. The Terkel conversa- tion began with an asserted resemblance ("neckties = conven- tion") that became, through unanticipated encounter factors, an enlarged and cumulatively significant metaphorical commen- tary.83 The "grass roots = value change" metaphor, whether in- tentional or not, surely offered conversational functions and his- torical implications beyond the initial motives of communicants.84 As an émergent dimension of meaning, then, metaphor offers unresearched information for studies of relational innovation, as well as studies of conversational structure. What can scarely be denied is Ricoeur's conclusion: "Live metaphors are metaphors of invention within which the réponse to the discordance in the sentence is a new extension of meaning. . . . There are no live metaphors in a dictionary."85 Metonymy, too, has a clear traditional connotation, wherein an intrinsically related group of particulars is represented by a figu- rative device, with the part of something coming to stand for the whole.86 Considering the rule-governed relationship of levels within actional meaning along with thè special complexities of inner-time guidance for even a single épisode, the métonymie explanation of meaning in communication would seem one logi- cai outgrowth of the language-action project. Our earlier ex-</page><page sequence="35">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 249 ample of women shaking hands at a formal party could take thè reconstructed form of metonymy (where "hand-shaking" stands for "thè entire formal character of this encounter"). More elabo- rate reconstructions can be found in most extended conversa- tions. In the following illustration, open-ended interviews were conducted at Michigan State University among husbands and wives. This excerpt is a case in which communication about decision-making patterns became, inadvertantly, a métonymie comment on the relational form itself : H: That particular situation. You go hyper on that whenever I say why don't you get yourself organized and get your priorities set and do other things and quit doing the things that don't make any différence and then being up-tight about what you don't get done. Yeah, organization. Don't sit there and look like you don't know what I'm talking about because we've talked about it, many a time. W: Yeah, but you feel like you're handing down an ultimatum and I'm supposed to . . . H: You always tell me that, no? W: . . .Well, it's true. H: No, I'm saying that you don't discuss that. W: No, but I do try and it's because I'm not as organized as you are; I can't help it, and I do try to be. H: But your dissatisfaction with that, uh, makes it more diffi- cult for you to discuss it with me. W: Right. Alright, we didn't say how we resolved our diffi- culties. H: What, most of the normal ones? W: Wasn't that part of the question? (H: yeah.) I think we can usually talk it out. H: If we don't, I beat you up. No. Yeah, we usually can corne to a common agreement.87 From the large number of possible approaches to this fragment (including topic-shift, meta-communication rules, rules of redu- plication and retrospection - ail clearly relevant), we urge imme- diate attention to the last utterance-sequence. There, the hus- band, in the guise of humor, seems to represent his own rela- tional dominance in an open profession of physical power. While</page><page sequence="36">250 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING it would be premature to pronounce upon the whole of this rela- tionship (based upon but one conversational fragment) the utter- ance does seem, metonymically, to "stand for" an important di- mension of the relationship in this transaction; this larger rela- tional dimension seems to be part of the utterance's meaning. Not surprisingly, this remark ("If we don't, I beat you up. . . .") is the last in the séquence; the encounter terminâtes at this point. If this example is suggestive, metonymy - like metaphor - might prove to be an important stylistic constituent of meaning in com- munication, given sufficient information to evaluate form of life and encounter dimensions of language-action. Finally, a range of important implications seems to derive from the multi-dimensionality of the language-action approach to meaning. Of initial importance is the manner in which such a middle-range synthesis might qualify and constrain scientific in- quiry and research. The extensive array of data pertinent to our conception of meaning makes it paramount that the investigator study the variations of communication usage within its own native forms, encounters, and séquences. Given the prescriptive char- acter of rules themselves, instances of compliance and déviation alone can never count as évidence sufficient to demonstrate the "existence" of given meanings in communication. The most crea- tive direction in current research has sought expérimental en- counter settings where communicants themselves must "impro- vise" rules governing their own decision-making.88 Studies of de- cision-making and sanctioning procédures in naturai encounter settings would provide additional reliability to the interprétation of meaning in communication. In extending the features of context relevant to meaning, we are also mindful of Katz and Fodor's objection to the contextual theory. As they see thè difficulty, "a complete theory of this kind [contextual theory] is not possible in principle; for to sat- isfy the above necessary condition it would be required that the theory represent ail the knowledge speakers hâve about the world."89 We may respond to this objection in two ways. First, in many if not most instances of communication, something less than an infinity of contextual factors is necessary for an ade- quate account of meaning. The actional level of meaning we</page><page sequence="37">THOMAS B. FARRELL AND THOMAS S. FRENTZ 251 have illustrateci here should even accommodate Katz and Fo- dor's objection by identifying rule-governed "zones of rele- vance" on each level of context that function so as to actualize meaning. Second, and most pertinent, we have attempted to expand the factors pertinent to an account of meaning in com- munication without ever presuming to either exhaust or delimit these factors. Like some of our terminology, our commitment on this matter is similar to that of phenomenology. We have sought to move away from a literal-minded, "sedimented" view of meaning to a "polymorphic" view - wherein the free variation of perspectives is encouraged. James Edie speaks well to both the urgency and the limits of the meaning project: For this reason phenomenology must define meaning as an 'open' structure, as a nonfìxed, morphological eidos which can be ap- proached perspectivally from an indefinite number of possible viewpoints, but which can ne ver be 'possessed' wholly and com- pletely under any one aspect. Any given meaning transcends ali its expressions; it is an eidetic structure (like a Kantian idea) which is the pole (noematic correlate) of an indefinite number of converg- ing signifying acts but which will always escape exhaustive analysis. We can define world-meanings progressively and render them more and more exçlicit, but however far we carry our attempt to express them, there will always be more to say. The phenomeno- logical clarification of expérience is an infinite task, which, in prin- ciple, must be unending.90 We believe, of course, that a communicative analysis of meaning may make important contributions to a phenomenology of expé- rience. But if Edie's remarks are taken to heart, all such contri- butions necessarily are preliminary.
