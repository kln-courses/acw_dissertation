The value of suffering is important in the face of dramatic upheavals when "suffering engendered distinction, sacrifice created status, aIId loss produced gain" (p. 83). Litanies thus be- come competitive and politicized. In this section I would have liked to hear a more concise discussion of what she means by re- sistance and how precisely litanies accomplish this end. The clearest message to be taken away from this book is that Russians themselves construct their"Russianness" through their speech patterns. As a Siberianist, it is clear to me that the discourses that Ries observed in Moscow take on a different character in the countryside. However, the templates for litanies and laments that she outlines do exist, even though the content varies. Ries's book forces us to look at the narratives provided by informants in a different light. That is, how do informants construct for us ourknowledge of what makes them who they are? At numerous points in the book Ries discusses her methodol- ogy. The first major hurdle in her fieldwork was the fall of the Berlin Wall, which represented the end of the Cold War. Since her research design rested on the existence of the Cold War, she was forced into the uncomfortable position of changing her re- search questions after arriving in the field. Talking about the fall of the Berlin Wall led to discussions about the dramatic changes in her informants' lives, which in turn led to the analysis we are presented. But relatively few of the discussions that she had with informants were recorded. In fact, she often did not take notes during the conversation out of a fear that it would halt the flow of speech. Although she would take notes immediately afterward, one must question the accuracy of some of the texts that she quotes. Her interactions were primarily with women, but she is very clear about this and does include some analysis of gender differences in litanies that included those interviews she was able to carry out with men. Ries's contribution to the anthropology of Russia is to show the value of using everyday speech to understand identity. Her intent is to provide an analysis of the changing identity of Mus- covites under perestroika. Although the situation is quite varied as one moves further away from Moscow, Ries' s innovative ap- proach and sensitive analysis makes this book essential for any scholar engaged in research in post-Soviet Russia. Daily rene- gotiations of self and group identity are fundamental to the so- cial and political transitions in the states that have emerged out of the ruins of the Soviet Union. Russian Talk is a very timely book for any scholar of the former Soviet Union and will also be very useful for scholars interested in studying identity forma- tion and social change. * Guia Etnografica de la Alta Amazonia, vol. 1 (Mai Huna, Yagua, Ticuna). Fernando Santos and Frederica Barclay, eds. Quito: Facultad Latinamericana de Ciencias Sociales (FLACSO) and Instituto Frances de Estudios Andinos (IFEA), 1 994. 456pp. MICHAEL F. BROWN Williams College Given the declining fortunes of cultural anthropology's em- pirical and comparative traditions, it is easy to forget that basic knowledge of minority cultures continues to be a scarce com- modity in many parts of the world. Indigenous communities are far more easily swept off the political map if their size, location, and distinctive features remain unknown to policymakers and the general public. Ethnographic information still matters, in other words, especially when offered in a form that is readily available to interested readers. The Guia Etnografica de laAltaAmazonfa is an ambitious at- tempt to bring together in a single series compact studies of the western Amazon's native societies. Organized by region and ethnolinguistic affinity, the Gufa will comprise more than a dozen volumes of ethnography-each containing two or ree concise monographic works as well as a pair of concluding volumes that explore the region's prehistory and broad cultural features from a comparative perspective. The contributors rep- resent a range of interests and theoretical traditions, but they share a common commitment to long-term, politically engaged field research among Amazonia's native peoples. As the series editors, Fernando Santos and Frederica Barclay, explain in a prologue, the obvious precursor of the Gu fa is Julian Steward's Handbook of SouthAmerican Indians, published be- tween 1946 and 1959 by the Bureau of American Ethnology. Unlike the Handbook, parts of which are based on the sketchiest of information, the Gufa can draw on detailed ethnographic and historical knowledge acquired over the past four decades. The landbook's focus on cultural evolution and its neglect of post- contact social processes have been superseded in the Guia by an emphasis on historical change and ethnogenesis. Indeed, the editors insist that one of the principal goals of the series is to document the efforts of Amazonian peoples to "assure them- selves of space as citizens with full rights within their respective countries and in this way guarantee their development as socie- ties with their own characteristics" (p. xiii, my translation). This inaugural volume gets the series off to a strong start by offering ethnographies of three groups located in northeastern Peru and adjacent areas of Colombia and Brazil: Irene Bellier's study of the Mai Huna (often referred to as the Orejones or Coto), a poorly understood Tukanoan people numbering around 300, Jean-Pierre Chaumeil ' s examination of the Yagua, a group of approximately 4,000; and Jean-Pierre Goulard's study of the Ticuna, who at 30,000 constitute one of the largest ethnolinguis- tic groups in contemporary Amazonia. The region in question has been shaped by major historical changes ranging from the arrival of prehistoric Tupi populations to the radical disloca- tions brought about by Franciscan and Jesuit missionary activity and, in the nineteenth century, by the Rubber Boom. Despite di- vergent linguistic origins, the Yagua, Mai Huna, and Ticuna demonstrate fascinating similarities with respectto kinship (no- tably, patrilineal clans and a system of dual organization), pat- terns of warfare, and long-range trade relations, all of which are explored by Santos and Barclay in a helpful introductory essay. Space limitations prevent me from reviewing each of the monographs at length. SufElce it to say that they are without ex- ception comprehensive, nuanced, historically informed, and clearly written. To further the comparative goals of ffie series, the editors have imposed a common format, but this constraint does not prevent the authors from putting a personal stamp on their work. Thus Bellier, whose prior publications have empha- sized the study of gender, offers an illuminating view of rela- tions between the sexes in her ethnography of the Mai Huna. Chaumeil, well known for his outstanding studies of Amazonian</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS / Sociocultural Anthropology X41 ethnohistory, shamanism, and ntual, develops these themes to good effect in his Yagua monograph. Goulard's contribution is especially strong in its analysis of the political undercurrents swirling beneath the Ticuna's long history of millenarian move- ments. In addition to the analytical introduction and the three monographs, the volume includes a regional vocabulary and a glossary of kinship terms but, alas, no general index. If the Guia is able to sustain the high quality of this first vol- ume and there is no reason to doubt that it will, considering the distinguished roster of contributors then it is certain to be- come an indispensible reference work for anyone interested in contemporary Amazonia. * Patterns that Connect: Social Symbolism in Ancient &amp; Tribal Art. Carl Schuster and Edmund Carpenter. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1996. 317 pp. HARALD E. L. PRINS Kansas State University The cross-cultural survey of tribal art presented in this beauti- fully illustrated book is bold in scope and interpretation. Based largely on the lifelong research and writings of Carl Schuster ( 1 90v1969), it is written by Edmund Carpenter who published an earlier edition of it entitled Social Symbolism in Ancient &amp; Tribal Art (Rock Foundation, 1 98S1988). The work under re- view here represents a dramatically shortened version of that 1 2-book, 3,500-page magnum opus, which includes 7,000 illus- trations (many of them magnificent) and over 1,500 biblio- graphic references. Having first met in 1959, and both intrigued by patterns, Car- penter and Schuster corresponded on folk symbols and tribal art motifs until the latter's death in 1969. Carpenter, who studied under Frank Speck and has a doctorate in anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania, has conducted extensive research among Arctic Canada's Eskimos and New Guinea's Papua since 1950. Schuster, who studied at Harvard and received his doctorate in art history from Vienna in 1934, traveled exten- sively ffirough Asia's backlands in the 1930s. Then, and in the decades that followed, he personally surveyed tens of thousands of artifacts in some 700 museums and private collections around the world. When Schuster died he had 46 articles to his credit, yet the lion's share of his research and manuscripts remained works in progress. His archives (80,000 negatives, 250,000 prints, 18,000 pages of correspondence in some 30 languages, hundreds of files on specific motifs, etc.) have since found a per- manent place at the Museum der Kulturen in Basel. Impressed by this heroic effort to identify basic tribal art mo- tifs and piece together the global puzzle of cultural tradition, Carpenter offered to complete what Schuster had started. It proved to be a herculean and consuming task. When the final text cohered, he no longer distinguished between Schuster's words and his own. As Caxpenter explains, the "I" in this text re- fers to himself, though many of his judgments come directly from Schuster's original writings. Like its earlier exhaustive edition, Patterns that Connect is an etymology and archaeology of ancient motifs representing a grand theory of kinship symbolism in tribal art. Its exposition can be summed up as follows: similar traditional art motifs and designs occur in tribal and peasant cultures across the globe; through the comparative method, we can recognize basic pat- terns in certain widespread and recurrent "geometric" motifs or schematic designs; theiroccurrence in the remote comers of Af- rica, Asia, Australia, and America minimizes the likelihood of numerous independent inventions; their uniformity suggests a common origin in the ancient past; because of strong resem- blances with Paleolithic art motifs in Eurasia, these patterns are probably "survivals" deeply rooted in a traditional culture com- plex farolderthan 10,000years; theircross-cultural existence is due primarily to very early prehistoric migrations, not cultural diffusion; through comparisons with related phenomena in tribal cultures where meanings of analogous designs are more obvious, we may become informed about the elementary princi- ples underlying these pattems; these principles articulate a sym- bolic language that can be decoded in terms of a genealogical iconography primarily illustrating social relations of marriage and descent; where original meanings of kinship diagrams were forgotten or lost, subsequent generations either imbued these patterns with altemative interpretations or simply replicated them as decorative or omamental designs; representing an im- mensely conservative tradition, this iconography links Paleo- lithic hunters and gatherers to still-surviving art traditions in a few tribal cultures as well as peasant communities. Organized in eight chapters, Patterns first discusses the wide- spread motif of the double-headed anthropomorphic figure and various other designs that are interpreted as the "family tree" and concern the universal question where we come from. This is followed in successive order by chapters titled "Genealogical Pattems" (hockers, zigzags, hourglass pattems, checkerboards, etc.), "Bodies and Hands as Kinship Charts" (joint-marks, fingers, etc.), "Social Bodies," "Mosaic Gaxments" (such as skin robes), "Compartment Robes," "Incised Stones" (inter- preted as dressed ancestral spirits), and "Rebirth" (inverted pen- dants, gaming boards, calendric charts, labyrinths, etc.). In their superb exhibit, the authors offer an unequaled exami- nation of traditional art and a grand conjecture that compels us to look at it with fresh eyes. While they may not be able to offer conclusive proof of their argument, their massive evidence and erudite interpretation flatten any lazy assumptions. Deserving serious consideration, this book should be of great interest not only to anthropologists specialized in tribal or prehistoric art, but also to museum curators and anyone else fascinated by the beauty and semiotics of"primitive" art. * The Political Economy of AIDS. Merrill Singer, ed. Amity- ville, NY: Baywood, 1998. 236 pp. BRADLEY STONER Washington University-St. Louis This book brings a long-overdue focus upon the social and political determinants of the AIDS epidemic, in terms of how oppressive social relationships fuel disease transmission and limit access to resources for prevention and care. Singer, a criti- cal medical anthropologist, notes in a preface to the volume that the collected essays grew out of a 1993 session at the applied aniropology meetings organized by Stephen Koester and Robert Carlson, entitled "The Political Economy of HIV Risk."</page></plain_text>
