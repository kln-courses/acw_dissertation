Albert Schweitzer HUMAN NATURE REDIV1VUS PETER A. CORNING It was never really dead—human nature. But we can learn something about human nature from the fact that for two generations the very concept was officiously, if not officially, pro nounced dead by many social scientists—with significant conse quences for our social practices, and for the practice of social science. For, as Leon Eisenberg has noted, "the behavior of men is not independent of the theories of human behavior that men adopt."1 Because we did not search for the influence of biolog ical factors in social life, of course we did not find it. And because we assumed that the basic problem of survival had somehow been "solved," we acted accordingly. 19</page><page sequence="2">20 PETER A. CORNING Even now, the mere mention of the term "human nature" evokes deep suspicion in some circles. To many empirically oriented so cial scientists it suggests simplistic generalizations and premature closure on a subject that should properly be open to scientific investigation, while among some normatively oriented scholars it raises the specter of arch political conservatism—and possibly latent racism. Neither set of fears is necessarily justified, but I will admit at the outset to more than a few anxieties about the hazards involved in resurrecting this venerable term. It is all too easy to draw facile and ill-founded conclusions about what is by all odds the most complex subject known to man—man himself. And the temptations to do so are obviously very great. Thus, in recent years man's behavior has been likened to that of the Uganda kob, and we have been told that we possess a ter ritorial instinct (Robert Ardrey, The Territorial Imperative); Konrad Lorenz, whose pioneering studies of animal behavior re cently won him a Nobel Prize, tells us (in On Aggression) that we have an instinctual "appetite" for aggression; on the other hand, zoologist Desmond Morris (The Naked Ape, The Human Zoo) compares us to neurotic baboons in the London zoo. Per haps most provocative for political scientists is the assertion by Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox (The Imperial Animal) that human politics is merely a refinement of male dominance competition; since dominance rivalry is commonly associated in other species with breeding functions (with competition for mates, nesting sites, etc.), "the political system is a breeding system."2 For many social scientists, these and other biologically oriented works have, regardless of their faults, opened a door to new ways of looking at human social and political behavior. But for many others, regrettably, these writings have had the effect of reviving the stereotypes of social Darwinism and biological determinism. The hoary and outmoded nature-nurture controversy has once more reared its head (most distressingly, in the angry debate over race and intelligence) and ancient prejudices have been revived and reinforced. Yet, despite the risk of abuse and misunderstanding, we cannot turn the clock back. The problem of survival looms larger and becomes more pressing as time goes on; it is increasingly obvious that the biological imperatives are the immediate problem for advanced Western societies, just as they have always been for</page><page sequence="3">Human Nature Redivivus 21 most societies through most of our evolutionary history. Further, as empirical research on the biological bases of social behavior continues to mount, the evidence is becoming irresistible that biological factors permeate and interact with social variables in many and complex ways. Human nature—in the sense of certain biological needs and givens that play a significant causal role in human social life—is a fact, even though we may choose to close our eyes to it. Having said this, however, I must add that human nature is proving to be far more complicated and subtle, and hard knowledge of the subject far less certain in many specific details, than has ever been dreamt of in our philosphy. As a scientific concept, we would do well at this juncture to treat human nature not as a set of dogmatic conclusions, but rather as a legitimate object of empir ical research. It should only be at the conclusion of research and not at this intermediate stage that we might hope for a fully satis factory understanding of the subject. Of what use to us, then, can the concept of human nature be in the interim? Does the term have sufficient definition, and do we know enough about the subject, for it to have value either as a tool for research or as a guide for social ethics? On both counts the answers are affirmative, I believe, and I would like to undertake here a brief review and synthesis to support this conclusion. I will try to show that, at the minimum, the concept of human nature can help us to delineate the most relevant parameters of the human condition; it can help us establish a framework, or paradigm, for research and suggest appropriate modes of analysis. Specifically, it can be utilized to generate a number of important propositions about man and society, and it can help us formulate testable hy potheses of a sort that should enable us to cast new light on the causes and the consequences of human behavior. In addition, I believe that a number of significant partial con clusions may be drawn. Some of these are quite firmly established or can logically be inferred from what we do know about the na ture of man, while others—though consistent with what we know —are more tentative and speculative. However, it is my conviction that, taken as a whole, the concept of human nature can provide us with a coherent frame of reference with respect to normative and empirical issues, and that we are now in a position to move be yond the stale and outdated arguments of an earlier era.</page><page sequence="4">22 PETER A. CORNING THE EVOLUTIONARY SYNTHESIS The primai fact of human existence, from which all else follows, is that man is the product of a continuous line of descent that is perhaps three billion years old. As an evolved species, Homo sapiens represents a cumulative legacy of genetic material and biological characteristics (as well as cultural accretions) that reaches back beyond our capacity to imagine. Indeed, modern anthropologists despair of trying to demarcate some critical thresh old, or Rubicon, for the emergence of man. At least two million years before the appearance of Homo sapiens, the African savan na was inhabited by group-living, bipedal, tool-using hunters who, though small-brained and lacking in sophisticated language skills, had much in common with our more immediate forebears of the Paleolithic. In protohominid nature, in other words, we can discern much of the biological substrate from which human nature evolved. (In fact, we share with all living primates many distinctive characteristics that can be traced to a common ancestor some tens of millions of years ago—including our manual grasping abilities, omnivorous digestive systems, visual acuity, elaborated cerebral cortex and, not least, our sociability.)3 Furthermore, through all the many eons during which man's biological inheritance was accumulating, it was being molded, tested, and retested by the "Grand Constructor" (as Lorenz puts it)—natural selection. This is no less true today than it has been in the past: the most fundamental and pervasive human problem, from which we can never escape (this side of our extinction as a species), is survival and reproduction.4 The ongoing problem of survival is the great common denominator that all species share— the Natural Law to which all species are subject—and it is to the exigencies of this problem that the "value-preferences" of natural selection are addressed. To be sure, the parameters of the survival problem vary from one species to another and from one habitat to another. For in stance, temperature maintenance for the equatorial Batutsi requires the dissipation of excess body heat (thus the evolutionary "ra tionale" for a tall, lean body build, which maximizes the amount of exposed surface area), whereas the Eskimo must conserve body heat in order to survive (a need well served by the Eskimo's char</page><page sequence="5">Human Nature Redivivus 23 acteristically short, chunky build). Conversely, different societies (or species) may have very different ways of dealing with such commonly shared aspects of the survival problem as, say, repro duction, even when they occupy similar niches. Thus a placental marine mammal like the bottlenose dolphin gives birth to live young and suckles them at the breast; whereas, among the egg bearing sharks, some species lay their eggs unhatched and others develop and hatch the young internally. Yet all of the many comparisons and contrasts that can be drawn between species, or between Homo sapiens and other spe cies for that matter, can best be understood in relation to how each species has been "tailored" by natural selection to cope with the survival imperatives in its own particular ecological niche. That is to say, functional design in nature is a consequence of the workings of natural selection through time upon the variations that naturally occur in biological processes, and the functional signi finance of any trait—at least from an evolutionary perspective— lies in its consequences for one or another aspect of the survival problem. Indeed, this utilitarian feature of evolution is the theoretical foundation upon which rests the science of ethology; the ethologist's explanation of how a particular behavioral character has come to be "fixed" in any species hinges upon a close analysis of its con tribution to survival and reproduction. A classic example is Niko Tinbergen's study of the black-headed gull's practice of removing the eggshells from the nest soon after the young are hatched. Tinbergen showed experimentally that the light-colored shells at tract avian predators and that shell removal increases significant ly the survival chances of the newborn.5 It should also be noted that ethological functionalism, or what I have taken to calling "evolutionary functionalism," applies both to the continuities and the changes that occur in a species over time. Both are a reflection, primarily, of the effects of various traits in relation to the ongoing survival problem. (Some modifica tion of these statements is obviously necessary with reference to rapidly changing human cultures, but the basic arguments remain valid—as I hope to show. ) The explanation for this close association between function and causation is that, in biological evolution, causation is circular and feedback-dependent. Natural selection—the most important agent</page><page sequence="6">24 PETER A. CORNING of transgenerational change—is not something external to the relationship between organisms and their environments. It is in reality a way of describing the outcomes of organism-environment interactions, and these outcomes, or "effects," are the "causes" of the more systematic continuities and changes between genera tions that Darwin characterized as "descent with modification." (I shall argue that an analogous kind of relational process lies at the heart of cultural evolution as well.) The textbook example is "industrial melanism." Until the in dustrial revolution, light strains of the peppered moth (Biston betularia) predominated in numbers in the English countryside over darker, melanic forms of the species. The latter were rela tively rare. The reason was that, when the moths were resting on tree trunks, the light forms were all but invisible against the lichen-encrusted trees, while the darker forms stood out. As a result, the light forms were far less subject to prédation from insect-eating birds. They survived and reproduced in greater num bers. However, as industrial soot progressively blackened the tree trunks near factory areas, the effect was to alter the relative visibility of light and dark forms, and in time this change in the organism-environment relationship brought about a reversal in the relative frequencies of the two forms. As the foregoing implies, the basic vocation, or "purpose," of all life forms involves the business of earning a living in the envi ronment. However, purposiveness in the biological realm is not the result of any preordained plan; it does not suggest a teleological or vitalistic view of life. To the contrary, evolution is an open, opportunistic, and contingent historical process. Biological pur posiveness relates only to what F. J. Ayala calls "internal teleol ogy"—the design characteristics of complex organic systems, in clusive of their behavior. Thus entelechy, or ends-directedness, exists only in the limited sense that the genotype (the array of genes or genetic blueprint) of each species (and each individual within a species) controls and directs the organization, ontogeny and, indeed, the entire life-cycle of different organisms in char acteristic ways. In other words, though Aristotle's famous acorn oak tree metaphor does not apply to the evolutionary process as a whole, it is an appropriate "model" for the products of evolu tion. (The question of how, specifically, this purposiveness ex presses itself in different species will be taken up below.)</page><page sequence="7">Human Nature Redivivus 25 As suggested above, the functional, or purposive character of biological organization applies not only at the organic level but at the behavioral and social levels as well. Behavioral traits are just as much a product of evolution as are organic processes, and the biological substrate upon which behavior depends is subject also to the workings of natural selection. Indeed, we now appreciate that behavior and morphology evolve together in an interactive and mutually supportive manner, with behavioral adaptations often preceding and precipitating changes in morphology. An example in humans is the adoption of milk by some populations as a regular part of the postweaning diet. Over time this has re sulted in positive selection for a genetically based lactose tolerance that does not exist in nonmilk-drinking populations. Another ex ample may be human skin pigmentation, which correlates well with variations in latitude and climate. Of course, cultural evolution has proceeded far more rapidly, at least in recent millennia, than evolution at the genie level. Yet cultural evolution could not have occurred without the benefit of evolved, biologically based human capacities and behavioral "build ing blocks" (about which more will be said below). Nor have human cultures been liberated, somehow, from the rigors of the survival problem. There is good reason to believe that cultural systems remain subject at all times to feedback from the biolog ical level—that human cultures continue to be tested in terms of their ability to meet the ongoing survival needs of different human populations in different habitats. Furthermore, the conventional wisdom of an earlier generation to the effect that human evolution had somehow been arrested with the emergence of culture is no longer tenable. Not only have significant changes occurred in recent times in the relative num bers of different human stock, but within any given human pop ulation the gene pool continues to "track" cultural changes; microevolutionary changes in gene frequencies are still occurring. In addition, there remains even in Western societies a significant degree of assortative mating and marked fertility differentials. It has been estimated that two-thirds of the genes in the human gene pool two generations hence will be drawn from one-third of the present generation. Needless to say, these changes in the human gene pool are greatly affected by cultural practices and historical processes, although we still do not have a very good fix on this</page><page sequence="8">26 PETER A. CORNING relationship—or its evolutionary implications. These reproductive biases would be immaterial were it not for two additional properties of our species which should be noted here. As zoologist Ernst Mayr put it, . . anyone dealing with human individuals is bound to make grave mistakes if he ignores these two great truths of population zoology: (1) no two individu als are alike, and (2) both environmental and genetic endowment make a contribution to nearly every trait."6 Since both of these "truths" are fundamental to the understanding of "human na ture," let us consider each in turn. Biological diversity, in the first place, is not simply "noise" that may be relegated to the error term in our models of human be havior. The "genotype" (the genetic "program" for a trait—or an organism) is an independent variable whose contribution to the traits that we actually observe in situ (the "phenotype") is ex ceedingly subtle and complex. It varies from one trait to another, one individual to another, one population to another, one envi ronment to another, and even from one era to another. To illustrate, one of the many factors that affect genetic diver sity is the "fitness value" (or adaptive value) of a trait. Those metric, or continuously distributed, traits that are most vital to survival and reproductive success—where the fitness value is high—often exhibit very little interindividual variation because natural selection operates through time to flatten out genetic variation. However, the adaptive significance of a trait is always a function of the environment. If the environment changes, so might the fitness value, which in turn may result in a relaxation of selection pressures. A good example in humans may be my opia. In Western cultures, short-sightedness is no longer a serious handicap and is thus more common than in the past. In short, the biological contribution to behavior cannot be couched in terms of universal laws that are applicable "anywhere and anywhen," in J. J. C. Smart's phrase. To quote Mayr again: All organisms and organic phenomena are composed of unique features and can be described collectively only in statistical terms. Individuals, or any kind of organic entities, form popu lations of which we can determine the arithmetic mean and the statistics of variation. Averages are merely statistical ab stractions; only the individuals of which the populations are</page><page sequence="9">Human Nature Redivivus 27 composed have reality. The ultimate conclusions of the popu lation thinker and of the typologist are precisely the opposite. For the typologist, the type (eidos) is real and the variation an illusion, while for the populationist the type (average) is an abstraction and only the variation is real. No two ways of looking at nature could be more different.7 This does not mean, of course, that measurement is a fruitless exercise, or that regularities and measures of central tendency are irrelevant. The populational emphasis in the quotation above is a useful antidote to the prevailing view of an earlier generation that science should properly concern itself only with repetitive phenomena, and that scientists may disregard or exclude the unique. However, it is also true that the biological realm is char acterized by both continuity and change—both regularity and diversity—through time and space. It has been estimated, to use man as an example, that about 95 percent of our genes are a common heritage; they are held in common descent. If this were not so, we could not be classified Homo sapiens and could not interbreed with one another. But perhaps 5 percent of each individual's genetic endowment is shared by no other living or ganism. And, from an evolutionary perspective, neither the 95 percent that is alike nor the 5 percent that is different is in herently more important; both are fundamental to the evolution ary process. Thus a social science that is properly attuned to the basic properties of the phenomena with which it is dealing must concern itself with both uniformity and diversity. Furthermore, these properties must be viewed from a perspective that is sen sitive to the historical and context-specific nature of evolution. As geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky has expressed it: "Culture is built on a shifting genetic foundation."8 As for the relationship between nature and nurture, or hered ity and environment, the Mayr quote above reflects the fact that the older dichotomy between mutually incompatible explanations of behavior has been superseded by a more sophisticated "interac tional" model. At the minimum, it is now appreciated that all behavior is biologically based at some level of analysis. Even learned behaviors depend upon evolved biological capacities, in cluding the capacities for being "rewarded" and "punished" in learning situations. Nor are these capacities unique to man. They</page><page sequence="10">28 PETER A. CORNING are found in lowly flatworms and mollusks, as well as in fish, birds, reptiles and mammals. These learning abilities are quite clearly a set of biological adaptations. Furthermore, the particular repertoire of learning abilities is tailored in each species to its survival needs and strategies. Rats, for instance, are superior maze learners, an aptitude of particular value to a tunnel-dwelling species, whereas, horses, which are adapted for life in open terrain, are "maze stupid." Even when different species are raised in identical environments, they will learn different things; animal trainers in circuses find they can reinforce only those behaviors that come to the animals "nat urally" and that they can use as reinforcements only what each animal "naturally" finds desirable or aversive. The role of biological factors in learning extends not only to learning aptitudes, but also to learning preferences. Different spe cies are endowed with different prepotencies for learning certain kinds of things, so that an animal in effect "wants" to learn what it needs to learn in order to survive. This may manifest itself in terms of stimulus preferences, or the kind of phenomena upon which an animal will focus its attention. Among the many exam ples from recent experiments with humans, one of the more sig nificant is the series demonstrating that infants have an innate preference for visual schema resembling the human face. Biological influences may also affect the relative ease with which different behaviors are learned. A rather dramatic example is the one-trial, long-term food avoidance conditioning that re sults from ingesting a food substance that is subsequently asso ciated with gastrointestinal illness.9 In the same vein, biological processes may control learning sequences and establish sensitive periods during which the learn ing of particular behaviors is greatly facilitated. Language devel opment in humans is an excellent example. There is a powerful predisposition for language development in human children, but it appears to peak before puberty; though there are, as always, individual differences, after about 12 years of age children be come less proficient at learning a second language, or at relearn ing language after suffering brain damage in Wernicke's area of the dominant hemisphere (the brain area most centrally involved in linguistic skills). Conversely, just as heredity potentiates and canalizes the learn</page><page sequence="11">Human Nature Redivivus 29 ing process, so environmental factors are generally involved in even the most rigidly instinctual, or "precoded" animal behaviors. At very least, environmental "releasers," or cues may be neces sary to trigger a stereotyped and unlearned response. But, in ad dition, instinctual behaviors are often subject to practice effects: with repeated trials, an animal may increase its proficiency or perhaps lower its response threshold. In many other cases, an animal may be only partially preprogrammed or predisposed to perform a particular behavior, so that environmental influences may be required to fill in the interstices. Thus, biological factors may define the degree of developmental flexibility for a particular trait, as well as establishing norms and limits of reaction to en vironmental influences (phenotypic plasticity). Bird vocalizations in several closely related species provide ex amples of almost every kind of heredity-environmental interac tion. Song sparrows, even if they are isolated from their own spe cies, will be able at maturity to reproduce their characteristic song without a flaw (of course, only if their ontogeny has been relatively "normal" in other respects). At the other extreme, isolated meadowlarks can learn the songs of a number of "foster parent" species; they are preprogrammed to sing but the specific song is not preprogrammed. In between these two extremes is the pattern of the white-crowned sparrows. They must hear the adult model of their own particular species' song during a limited sen sitive period if they are to perform successfully. Still other species have the ability to learn an entirely new song later in life, or can learn any number of "dialects" of their own species' song but not the song of any other species. In short, there is no general pattern of behavioral causation that would enable us to predict beforehand the precise relation ship between nature and nurture. Even among closely related species, behaviors that appear on the surface to be quite similar may in fact be organized and developed in different ways. Hence, each species, and each trait, must be analyzed in its own terms.10 One widely employed method for estimating (at least in global terms) the relationship between nature and nurture in the expres sion of a particular trait involves the concept of heritability. Heritability (h2) refers not to the total biological contribution to a trait but only to the proportion of the total phenotypic varia tion that can be attributed to genotypic differences among in</page><page sequence="12">30 PETER A. CORNING dividuals.11 Researchers in behavior genetics utilize several dif ferent research paradigms and, over the years, heritability esti mates have been made under experimental conditions for every thing from extraversion to schizophrenia—though of course the best-known and most controversial studies involve the heritability of "intelligence." Although heritability estimates may provide some useful infor mation, under even the best of circumstances they can provide only a limited insight into the precise relationship between nature and nurture. One problem is that a heritability estimate is a very plastic sort of statistic. Because it is calculated as a percent age of the total observed (phenotypic) variation, it is always a function of the amount of environmental variation, which may differ considerably from one population to another.12 For a pop ulation in a uniform environment, most of the observed varia tion might be genetical, whereas in a population sample drawn from a highly varied environment, the converse might be true. Hence, heritability estimates are specific to the particular pop ulation and environment at the particular time the population is sampled; they cannot be generalized to other populations in other environments, nor—since they are population statistics—can they properly be used to deal with individual cases. The most serious pitfall, though, is that heritability estimates reveal nothing about the specific biological mechanisms and environmental factors involved in producing a particular trait—or how these mecha nisms may interact with one another. In sum, we cannot equate heritability with human nature. Heritability estimates can help us account for the variations that we observe in human behavior; they do give us some overall indication of the biological contrib ution to human variability, but nothing more. What can we conclude from this very brief discussion of man as an evolved species? First, an evolutionary perspective enables us to posit that an intelligible organizing principle underlies the emergence and historical development of man. Human evolution, both at the biological and at the cultural level, has been a rela tional process oriented to coping with the ongoing survival prob lem, with all of its many facets and ramifications (see below). However, the biological foundation of human behavior, what an thropologist Earl Count several years ago aptly termed the hu man "biogram," is not forever fixed and cannot properly be con</page><page sequence="13">Human Nature Redivivus 31 ceived of in terms of some sort of ideal type. Human nature is biologically diversified, developmentally flexible and emergent, and, most important, inextricably enmeshed in a great variety of natural and cultural environments. In each generation, human nature is re-created anew; from the moment of conception on, unique genotypes interact with their unique environments in such a way as to produce diverse phenotypes. These phenotypes are not only capable of reproducing themselves, they are capable also of diverse purposive behaviors, both as individuals and as members of organized human groups, and it is to the purposive nature of man and society that we now turn. THE EVOLUTIONARY MODEL OF HUMAN NATURE As biologist Alexander Fraser has observed, purposive behavior of all kinds, and at all phylogenetic levels, has two basic properties: (1) the capacity for specifying an intrinsic or self determined goal-state, and (2) the ability to initiate and maintain a pattern of behavior directed toward the attainment of that goal.13 Any number of examples can be adduced : the process by which, under proper conditions of temperature and moisture, plant seeds germinate, orient themselves to gravity, respond to pressure, grow toward sunlight, differentiate, and, in time, produce new seeds; or anmal morphogenesis, the process by which gametes, after combining into zygotes, are transformed and elaborated into fully developed, self-reproducing organisms. Purposiveness is evi dent too in the reproductive behavior of anadromous fish, which return from the open sea to fresh-water spawning grounds when the breeding season arrives; it is manifest in the sometimes in credible nest-building feats of birds, in the pack-hunting organi zation of hyenas, and in the tool-using (and in some cases tool making) behavior of Galapagos woodpecker finches, Egyptian vultures, satin bower birds, common blue jays, California sea otters, hamadryas baboons, chimpanzees and, of course, man. In Homo sapiens, needless to say, purposive behavior very often has an "intentional" or "deliberate" quality, and though conscious intentionality may not be entirely unknown in other species, humans are certainly without peer in being able to orient behavior to perceived relationships between means and ends, and</page><page sequence="14">32 PETER A. CORNING to anticipated outcomes. Yet there remains an important dimen sion of purposive behavior in humans which involves ««inten tional acts. We call some of them habitual (or "second nature"); others are reflexive in character and involve behaviors that ap pear, at least, to exclude conscious intervention. A commonplace example is the act of turning a bicycle. A cyclist's decision to make a turn may or may not involve premeditation, but there is very seldom premeditation, or even awareness, about the neces sity for first turning the front wheel in the direction opposite to the turn to prevent being thrown outward by centrifugal force. Most cyclists make this movement automatically and unknowingly. Although there is an almost endless diversity of goal-directed behaviors in the biological realm, they share the common ground of being instrumental, normally, to biological ends. Of course, in complex human societies, the relationship among "motivation," behavior, and survival-related functions is often more indirect. Because of the partial autonomy of human purposiveness, fur thermore, maladaptive behaviors are not uncommon. (These are points we shall pursue further below.) Nonetheless, in a broad sense the functioning of complex or ganisms can be said to be under the control of endogenous "goal structures" whose organizing principles reflect the cumulative legacy of each species' evolutionary history. As should become clear presently, this assertion is not a throwback to simplistic no tions of biological determinism or free will. Though intrinsic pur posiveness and self-regulation in the biological realm is determin istic in nature, it very often includes mechanisms that enable an animal to fabricate instrumental subgoals and to carry out learned behaviors, or behaviors that are feedback-sensitive and modifiable while in progress. Indeed, most behavior is subject to at least some environmental and experiential influence; at one level of analysis, an organism and its environment may be viewed as forming a closed loop in which there are mutual interactions and reciprocal feedback. Thus, it is more accurate to say that both the organism and the environment "determine" behavior. The two dimensions cannot in practice be separated from each other. To those who are familiar with cybernetics and systems theory, the foregoing will doubtless be suggestive, if not commonplace.14 The discussion above implies that complex organisms (inclusive of their behavior) may be described, or modeled, as cybernetic</page><page sequence="15">Human Nature Redivivus 33 systems—that is, as dynamic, goal-oriented, self-regulating, feed back-dependent organizations of matter and energy. This is indeed the case, although the particular model and underlying theory that I would like to sketch briefly here go beyond the analytic for mulations with which social scientists have become familiar in recent years. Even though the explorations and heuristic models of scholars like Talcott Parsons, Karl Deutsch, David Easton, and others represented an important step forward in terms of our ability to identify and describe the "skeletal structure" of social and political organization, unfortunately some social scientists have become disaffected because these efforts did not, in and of themselves, explain "real" systems. In retrospect, these explorations could have benefited from a broader, multidimensional frame of reference. From an evolution ary and biological vantage point, social systems—in any social species—represent, quite simply, one level of biological organiza tion; they are a common outcome of the evolutionary process. Cybernetic models cannot "explain" biological organization (al though they may be useful in helping us understand the structure and behavior of a system and its components). Rather it is the theory of evolution that can explain the origins and development of the phenomena encompassed by cybernetic models; in an im portant sense, the evolutionary process as a whole may be char acterized as a series of explorations, or experiments with hier archical, purposive organization. What is required to bring cybernetic models of social and po litical life into proper focus is to meld the theory of evolution (including a formally analogous theory of cultural evolution, which I shall describe) to a hierarchical, multilevel cybernetic model of biological organization that embraces "molecular," organismic, be havioral, social, and political levels. Not only is it my contention that such a model best fits the basic architecture of human na ture but that it is an appropriate model for other species as well, even those that do not exhibit social or political "levels" of or ganization. (Indeed, hierarchical, cybernetic organization is prob ably one of the most important of commonalities among different species.) The concepts that I shall be discussing are not in most cases new, but perhaps my synthesis is. First, what are some of the more important properties of a cybernetic system? They include: (1) systemic goal-orientation</page><page sequence="16">34 PETER A. CORNING (including possibly many instrumental subgoals); (2) interaction among functionally specialized components, or "subsystems"; (3) hierarchical organization (with higher levels being more encom passing and integrative); (4) synergism (collective properties that cannot be predicted from an understanding of the components); (5) interactions with the external environment across system boundaries (usually referred to as "inputs" and "outputs"); (6) internal control, or self-regulation, in relation to systemic goals and subgoals; (7) communications processes (within the system and between the system and its environment); (8) feedback (in formation inputs relating specifically to the behavior of the sys tem); (9) historicity (cybernetic systems are irreversible processes taking place through time); and (10) negentropy (cybernetic systems appear to resist the second law of thermodynamics be cause their processes do not lead inherently to a state of max imum disorder and energy dispersal but to exactly the reverse). The key to understanding how such a system operates is to envision it as being positioned so that it is an integral part of a closed loop (see Figure 1) that includes: (a) the system; (b) the system's environment; (c) inputs from the environment (includ ing feedback from the system's own behavior); and (d) the sys tem's "outputs" into the environment. In contrast to other models of behavior, the cybernetic model posits that the behavior of the system involves a relationship between internal goals (or "refer ence signals" in systems theorists' parlance) and various environ mental inputs (or "sensor signals"). Cybernetic systems are so constructed that they act to achieve and maintain a dynamic sta bility (or a "zero error signal") in relation to their environments. In other words, behavior is "caused" in a cybernetic system by both the internal goal structure of the system and the status of the system in relation to these goals. The desired relationship between the system and its environment is defined by a set of internal re ferents, and these are "compared" to the actual relationship as indicated by various external inputs. As Powers has shown,15 the behavior of such a system can be described mathematically in terms of its tendency to oppose an environmental disturbance of an internally controlled quantity. The derivation of this relationship is, briefly, as follows. Let us suppose that a controlled quantity qc represents some function (or analog) of certain environmental variables f (vi,v2 .... vn),</page><page sequence="17">Human Nature Redivivus 35 Figure 1. The basic unit of organization in a cybernetic control system. (After William T. Powers, "Feedback: Be yond Behaviorism," Science, 179: 4071, 1973.

Disregarding signs, if a change in this controlled quantity A qc is equal to g(d), where d is a quantitatively measurable disturbance affecting at least some of the variables and g is a function describ ing the relationship between the disturbance and the controlled quantity; and if, further, h represents a function of the environ mental relationship between the controlled quantity and the sys tem's output o such that Aqc= h(o); then, assuming control is good, when g(d) ^ -h(o), A qc ~ 0. That is to say, the system will operate in such a way that some function of its output quan tities will be nearly equal and opposite to some function of a dis turbance in some or all of those environmental variables that affect the controlled quantity, with the result that the controlled quan tity will remain nearly at its zero point. It should be emphasized, however, that the above derivation is greatly simplified and describes only the most rudimentary model. For one thing, more complex cybernetic systems are not limited to maintaining any sort of simple and eternally fixed steady state. In a complex system overarching goals may be maintained by means of an array of hierarchically organized subgoals that may</page><page sequence="18">36 PETER A. CORNING be pursued contemporaneously, cyclically, or even seriatim; cer tain subgoals may be recurrent or else emergent as a system de velops through time or as the system's environment changes. On occasion, in fact, the destabilizing and reorganizing of lower level goals may serve to enhance higher level stability or viability. In other words, reference signals within a complex system may them selves vary in a purposeful way. Some of these subgoals may be preprogrammed, while others may be "learned," or unlearned, as appropriate (an example in human behavior is the many cultural ly conditioned ways of satisfying basic nutritional needs). Indeed, an appreciation of the hierarchical and flexible organization of goals in complex systems is essential to understanding how the cybernetic model can be applied to the immense variety of learned human behavior patterns, including—significantly—novel behav iors and problem-solving behaviors (see below). Another important exclusion from the simplified model above is the situation, common in the biological realm, in which a par ticular cybernetic system may be located within a hierarchy of systems; it is frequently the case that a cybernetic system is com posed of subsystems that are themselves cybernetic systems, or that the system's environment largely or wholly consists of a more encompassing cybernetic system. In point of fact, it is coming to be appreciated that hierarchical organization is one of the most important properties of biological systems. As Pattee has observed: It is a central lesson of biological evolution that increasing complexity of organization is always accompanied by new levels of hierarchical controls. The loss of these controls at any level is usually malignant for the organization under that level. Fur thermore, our experience with many different types of complex systems, both natural and artificial, warns us that loss of hier archical controls often results in sudden and catastrophic failure. Simple tools may wear out slowly and predictably, but as sys tems grow in size and complexity they reach a limit where a new level of hierarchical control is necessary if the system is to function reliably.16 Because the significance of hierarchical organization is often unappreciated (and equally often misunderstood), let us consider the concept briefly. In the first place, hierarchy involves a partial</page><page sequence="19">Human Nature Redivivus 37 ordering of phenomena in two dimensions—horizontally among components or subsystems and vertically between sequential levels (or between sets and supersets). The simile most often invoked is a set of Chinese boxes. Grobstein also employs a figure involv ing subdivided triangles (see Figure 2). M J G Figure 2. Hierarchical order in Chinese boxes and sub divided triangles. Note that successively larger triangles are in each case composed of several smaller ones. (From The Strategy of Life, second edition, by Clifford Grobstein. W. H. Freeman and Company. Copyright ® 1974.) There are, as Grobstein has noted, two distinct kinds of hier archies, those that are "facultative" or reversible (they can be dispersed and reconstituted) and those that are "obligative" or nonreversible (when the component elements lose their autono my). In human organizations, both kinds are manifest, often within the same organization—-for example, unskilled laborers versus highly specialized technical personnel who cannot readily transfer their skills to other jobs or learn new jobs. The existence of a hierarchy can be verified empirically in terms of patterns of interaction. For instance, component parts of a hierarchy may or may not interact with one another, but they will generally interact with higher levels. Nonetheless, the total number of horizontal interactions will always be far greater than the number of vertical interactions. Another important characteristic of hierarchical systems has to do with the paradox that their behavior must be viewed and in terpreted differently, depending upon one's level of analysis. A</page><page sequence="20">38 PETER A. CORNING particular phenomenon may have quite different properties at different levels of organization, or it may have consequences at some levels and not at others. James S. Coleman offers the follow ing illustration : Once when I was sitting on the edge of a cliff, a bundle of gnats hovered in front of me, and offered a strange sight. Each gnat was flying at high speed, yet the bundle was motionless. Each gnat sped in a ellipse, spanning the diameter of the bun dle, and by his frenetic flight, maintaining the bundle motion less. Suddenly, the bundle itself darted—and then hovered again. It expanded and its boundaries became diffuse; then it contracted into a tight, hard knot and darted again—all the while composed of nothing other than gnats flying their endless ellipses. It finally moved off and disappeared. Perhaps also it dissipated and ceased to exist, each gnat going his own way. Such a phenomenon offers enormous intellectual problems: how is each gnat's flight guided, when its direction bears al most no relation to the direction of the bundle? How does he maintain the path of his endless ellipse? And how does he come to change it, when the bundle moves? What is the structure of control, and what are the signals by which control is trans mitted?17 As a biological phenomenon, hierarchical organization is not always and everywhere adaptive; its adaptiveness very much de pends upon the particular context. Moreover, there are always costs involved, at least from the viewpoint of the components or subsystems. Yet the fact that hierarchical organization is wide spread in nature suggests that it is very often advantageous. For example, hierarchical organization produces a significant simplify ing and economizing of interactions among the components of a complex system, a phenomenon that can be demonstrated mathe matically. Component parts may be freed of many constraints even as the establishment of hierarchical control imposes partial constraints (a point with which Plato was quite familiar).18 In deed, hierarchical constraints are always highly selective; "irrele vant" aspects of component behavior are usually "ignored." It can also be demonstrated mathematically that a system will evolve more rapidly when its component parts are organized into stable</page><page sequence="21">Human Nature Redivivus 39 subsystems. Hierarchical organization may therefore facilitate evo lutionary change. However, the most important advantage of hierarchical organi zation is that it may facilitate the achievement by the component parts of either shared or complementary goals; hierarchy may lead to synergy. To an evolutionary biologist this means synergy with respect to the problem of survival and reproduction. The basic postulate of the evolutionist is that confusion evolves into order through the workings of natural selection, and insofar (but only insofar) as complexity and its concomitant, hierarchical order ing, enhance the chances of survival and reproductive success, such patterns will also be favored by natural selection, whether it be at the organsimic or the social level of organization. In other words, though in Homo sapiens hierarchical, cybernetic organiza tion has reached its fullest expression, it is not a human invention but is instead a common evolutionary strategy. How, then, do we apply the above model specifically to man? At the level with which we are primarily concerned here, that of the individual organism, we can posit something very like the more complex version that we have described. Because man is normally group-living, each individual represents an intermediate level of organization, below which are several levels that both serve and must be served, and above which is at least one and frequently several levels of social and political organization, be ginning with simple "dyadic" relationships (insofar as they involve collaborative, goal-oriented behaviors). We are not accustomed to treating more encompassing, social levels of organization as an integral part of human nature. We have been taught to think of culture as an artifact or superstruc ture. Yet, from an evolutionary perspective, social organization is a functionally important dimension of biological organization. Because man is a social animal with a very long history of "to getherness," social organization is, quite simply, an actualization of behaviors that are potentiated by human nature. In an evolu tionary model of human nature, therefore, various social levels of organization represent partial orderings at a more encompassing level than that of the individual organism; social organization is a natural extension of human purposiveness. And like any other hierarchically organized cybernetic system, social systems have no existence apart from their constituent individuals and yet may have</page><page sequence="22">40 PETER A. CORNING collective properties that transcend any given individual. (We shall return to the matter of social organization and its utility below.) Accordingly, as an integral part of a hierarchical system, each individual is at one and the same time a servant of basic physiolog ical needs, a pursuer of his own personal "psychological" and social needs (and purposes) and a contributor to the functioning of various social, economic, and political organizations. Not only do all of these levels interact with and affect one another, but all are integrally related to the enterprise of earning a living in the environment. As I have argued in detail elsewhere,19 a human society is in essence a collective survival enterprise in which various aspects of the survival problem are dealt with collabora tively. The particular organizational patterns vary widely, of course. In every society we know of, there is some division of labor. But most societies also deal collaboratively with certain overriding sur vival problems (for instance, group defense or food procurement, or a division of water rights). More complex societies divide and subdivide the problem into a myriad of specific functional tasks which are dealt with by the various intermediate-level organiza tions (beginning with the nuclear family), while a number of coping and integrative functions may also be performed at the most in clusive level. Not all the purposive social activities in modern societies are adaptively significant, of course. Some are nonessential activities that may perhaps have latent social functions (this is a much analyzed subject). Others may simply fulfill otherwise unmet so cial or "psychological" needs, using a society's "margin of profit," so to speak. Others are maladaptive—in the strict Darwinian sense of the term. The evolutionary significance of human organizations is, need less to say, an exceedingly complex subject and deserves more extended treatment. For our present purpose, though, it is suffi cient only to underscore the point that in any social species, in cluding man, social organization evolves in the context of its in strumental relationship to the problem of survival and reproduc tion (see below). Consonant with this model of human nature, we would expect the behavioral substrate of the species to have an intelligible pat</page><page sequence="23">Human Nature Redivivus 41 tern of organization. It should be hierarchically organized, with the highest-level goals, those relating to survival and reproduction as a member of a social species, encompassing and integrating an array of subgoals (and subsubgoals) that relate to the many concrete aspects of the survival problem. At one end of the spec trum there are such individual life-support needs as food, water, shelter, physical safety, sleep, etc. At the other end are the tran scendent "social" problems associated with maintaining a viable economy, society, and polity. And in between are the problems associated with the reproduction and nurture of the young and with caring for those to whom we are personally "bonded." In deed, for each individual in a social species like man, the survival problem can be broken down into four distinct sets of needs, each of which relates to the larger problem of sustaining a viable spe cies—but which must also be integrated and reconciled with one another if a society is to remain viable.20 There are: (1) the needs related to the ontogeny and development of the individual; (2) the needs related to the maintenance and self-fulfillment of mature individuals; (3) the needs of the individuals to whom we are closely "bonded" and who are dependent upon us, partic ularly mates, progeny, and close relatives; and (4) the needs of the more inclusive social order upon which we and our "loved ones" are in varying degrees dependent for the fulfillment of the needs in 1, 2 and 3.21 From an evolutionary perspective, the highest-level goal has to do with maintaining the unbroken chain of life. It involves the survival of the species. Immediately below this come the goals listed above. We may or may not be aware of the fact that we are endowed with such superordinate goals, but I am positing that these goals do transcend and integrate the subservient level of subgoals with which we are more familiar (i.e., nutrition, sleep, sex, etc.) This third level of goals is in turn subserved by the specific behavioral repertoire of the individual—which itself may constitute several levels of instrumental subgoals, subsubgoals and so on (see Figure 3). Flowever, goals at each subservient level, even if they may be pursued as ends in themselves by the individ ual, can be understood only in terms of their instrumental rela tionship to higher-level goals. As we ascend the hierarchy, more over, we go from goals that are more specific yet (especially in man) more subject to learning and feedback control to goals that</page><page sequence="24">42 PETER A.

The proposed goal-hierarchy as applied to hypo thetical examples in two different cultural contexts.</page><page sequence="25">Hiiman Nature Redivivus 43 are at once more encompassing yet more biologically prepro grammed. What must the motivational substrate and neural organization of the human brain be like in order to conform to this model? Obviously, it must organize and integrate the behavior system in such a way that the diverse and sometimes conflicting survival needs can in general be harmonized (though the psychic condition of the individual may be anything but tranquil). To cite one ex ample, the individual should ordinarily be strongly motivated to engage in behaviors oriented to the meeting of pressing physiolog ical needs. Yet these usually urgent needs might under some cir cumstances have to be completely suppressed for varying lengths of time in order to cope with an even more pressing threat to sur vival—say in a situation in which the individual's life is in im mediate danger. In such cases, an elaborate and well-documented sequence of autonomic responses does in fact suppress many nor mal bodily functions (fatigue, hunger, digestion, peristalsis, etc.) and, at the same time, mobilizes the individual for emergency ac tion (increased heart rate, increased respiration, the transfer of blood from skin and viscera to muscles and brain, release of stored carbohydrates into the bloodstream, and so forth). Let us be candid, however. Although we have many partial insights, human behavior is organized and integrated within each individual in ways that are still imperfectly understood. Some of the needs described above express themselves at the individual level in the form of motivational mechanisms that have been reasonably well pinpointed—for instance, the so-called deficiency motivations (such as hunger, thirst, etc.) that create internal distress and stimulate "coping" responses. In effect, such mech anisms involve a substrate of psychic punishments and rewards— punishments for not performing biologically necessary behaviors and rewards for doing so. Conversely, many maladaptive behav iors are discouraged, so to speak, by well-defined internal mech anisms that are designed to make such behaviors unpleasant, or "aversive" (for example the subjective experience of pain, various forms of discomfort, or fear of the strange). Other needs, partic ularly those involving social, affiliative, and affectional behaviors, appear to have similar properties, but their biological substrates are less well understood at the present time. There is also the class of emotional reactions that amount to a</page><page sequence="26">44 PETER A. CORNING set of innate "reference signals" which, in effect, remain at zero in a psychologically optimal environment. For instance, the "fear fight, fear-flight" mechanism imposes on the organism a need for an unthreatening environment, and the neural substrate is so or ganized that it permits alternative coping responses depending upon the particular environmental context. Major elements of this substrate have in fact been identified in the limbic system of the paleocortex. In a similar vein, "boredom" and frustration are a normal response to an environment lacking in stimulation and the opportunity for purposeful activity, and, in this case, the ascending reticular activiting system (ARAS) in the upper brain stem is implicated as being of particular importance. By the same token, the particular repertoire of learning capaci ties and learning biases exhibited by Homo sapiens can better be understood if learning processes are subsumed as instrumental to higher level goals as pursued by different individuals and groups in different ways and in different environments. The objective of learning is not merely to link responses to stimuli in accordance with the "laws" of learning, but to cope with the environment in order to satisfy internal needs. In sum, what we know about the neural organization of the human brain is consistent with the model I have described. Our knowledge is still so full of gaps that major refinements in current thinking are bound to occur, but I hope that the model will prove to be correct in essentials and will, in any event, improve our understanding of human nature. And this brings us to a considera tion of how the model proposed here relates to some of the major alternatives that have been advanced in recent decades. ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF HUMAN NATURE Three more or less systematic models of human nature have been proposed by various behavioral scientists. There is, first, the model of the behaviorist psychologists. In the classical "stimulus-response" (S-R) paradigm postulated by John B. Wat son and others in the 1920s, man was characterized as being rather like a switchboard; behavioral outputs were posited to be a simple function of "environmental" inputs, and the organism itself was presumed to impose no order or intrinsic purposes on the input-output transactions. In recent years, of course, the be</page><page sequence="27">Human Nature Redivivus 45 haviorist model has been greatly refined in response to the grow ing recognition that the organism—the "black box"—is not an entirely empty receptacle but represents an intervening variable. It has also become apparent to learning theorists that the rein forcing properties of environmental "stimuli" are somehow hier archically organized. Yet "radical" behaviorists, most notably B. F. Skinner, still deny the concept of endogenous "goals."22 According to Skinner, purposes can no more be attributed to a biological entity than can anthropomorphic properties be assigned to nonliving matter; we can no more speak of "goals" in behavior than we can speak of the "exuberance" of a falling stone. Both attributes are to Skinner metaphysical nonsense. Of course, Skinner's "analogy" is in fact a non sequitur. Skinner seems unaware of the profound disanalogy between the organized complexity of the biological realm and the unorganized complexity of nonliving matter; evolved biological "systems" are and must be goal-oriented, but "weather systems" are not. Of all the many questions that have been begged over the years by the behaviorist model of man, the most telling arises from our revitalized appreciation of man as an evolved and evolv ing species. How is it possible that the behavior system of our species could have emerged without reference to the rigors of the survival problem? How can it be, in view of the precariousness of the life process, that natural selection imposed no order upon the relationship between man and his environment? To so argue flies in the face of everything we know about the evolutionary process. It reflects an extraordinary naïveté about the biological realm. Consider this problem. When a rat is taught to obtain a food reward by pressing a lever in response to a light signal, the animal not only learns the instrumental lever-pressing behavior but learns also to vary his behavior patterns in accordance with where he is in the cage at the moment the light signal is emitted, so that, no matter what the animal's starting position, the outcome is al ways the same. How is it that the rat is able to vary his behavior in precise, purposeful ways so as to produce a constant result? Some behaviorists have postulated environmental "cues" that mod ify the properties of the main stimulus acting upon the animal and so modify the animal's behavior. But this argument is implau</page><page sequence="28">46 PETER A. CORNING sible. As Powers has pointed out, it requires the modifying cues to work with quantitative precision upon the animal's nervous system; also, these cues are hypothetical and have never been satisfactorily elucidated; but most important, these cues cannot deal with novel situations in which the animal would have had no prior opportunity to learn any modifying "cues." A far more parsimonious explanation is that the animal's behavior is pur posive; the rat varies its behavior in response to immediate en vironmental feedback, so as to achieve an endogenous subgoal (food) which in this case also involves a learned third order goal (pressing the lever). The second "psychological" model of man involves the postu late of an array of internal drives, or "instinctual appetites." It has had a many-sided career. It can be found in the pessimistic writ ings of Thomas Hobbes; it was elaborated into a veritable laundry list by William James; Clark Hull gave it scientific respectability through carefully documented exposition; but it was in the hands of Freud that it achieved its apotheosis. In the Freudian schema, there is a sharp trichotomy between: (a) our primitive, uncivilized animal nature (the id) which Freud characterized as "a cauldron full of seething excitations";23 (b) the instrumental, calculating ego, which serves the instinctual drives of the id-, and (c) the superego—the internal repository for the constraining and civiliz ing forces of society. According to Freud, whereas the behavior of early man and contemporary primitives was dominated by instincts (read "nature"), civilized societies have gradually super imposed cultural controls (read "nurture"). But because the ins tinctual forces in man have not been eliminated, an unavoidable tension exists between instinct and civilization, nature and nur ture, id and superego. Thus, man is doomed to an inner struggle be tween the dark and even self-destructive forces of his animal na ture and the repressive, but also progressive, forces of society. Though Freud's work contains many important and durable insights (most importantly, his elucidation of the unconscious mind), the model as a whole has not weathered well. First, it is simply not correct to portray our ancestors or contemporary primitives as being governed by instincts, any more than "civi lized" man is governed by "rational" (or external) forces. Both aspects are equally "natural" and very ancient. Nor is it correct to assert that egoistic motivations are instinctual, whereas "so</page><page sequence="29">Human Nature Redivivus 47 rial" impulses are not; indeed, the tension between self-serving and "altruistic" motivations is typical of any social species. Rather than being the reflection of a meaningless inner turmoil that is unique to civilized man, it reflects a functional, though not always harmonious or successful, balancing act between complementary survival needs; it is an unavoidable concomitant of pursuing a collective survival strategy. Because both the needs of individuals and of the group upon which the individual and his progeny are dependent have relevance to the continued viability of group living species, natural selection will tend to optimize for both egoistic and altruistic "values"—although what is "optimal" in evolutionary terms is generally context-specific. (We shall have more to say on this point later on.)24 Finally, it should be noted that the Freudian model does not conform in important respects with our developing understanding of the neural and endocrine organization of the human brain. For example, it is becoming evident that anger-induced aggression is under the control of both facilitative and inhibitory mechanisms in the limbic system of the "old brain," and that both mecha nisms are susceptible to some experiential "programming." Any given instance of anger-induced violence may thus involve a dynamic interplay between inhibitory and facilitative mechanisms, as modified also by immediate perceptual feedback and "real time" cognitive and evaluative processes. The most recent, most elaborate, and currently most popular model of man is that of the late Abraham Maslow. Maslow's brand of "humanistic psychology" has had a powerful appeal be cause it is at once optimistic in tone and very flattering to intel lectual and creative people. According to Maslow, man is neither a behavioral sponge (as the behaviorists would have it) nor a tormented neurotic (as the Freudians hold), but a natural in nocent (shades of Rousseau) who is endowed with an array of biologically based needs that ascend hierarchically through five categories from "deficiency motivations" (which derive from such physiological needs as food, water, shelter, sleep, sex, etc.) to "being motivations" (at the apex of which is "self-actualization" —or the full use of one's talents and potentialities).25 "Evil," by which Maslow means particularly human destructive ness, is not innate in man, as Freud postulated, but "reactive" (that is, a response to frustrations). On the other hand, the more</page><page sequence="30">48 PETER A. CORNING complex and constructive human motivations are authentic and innate. Only when these "higher" motivations are satisfied is the true potential for human fulfillment realized, but this cannot occur unless the "lower," more basic (and more urgent) needs are satisfied first. Not all men may be capable of self-actualization, but the satisfaction of basic needs will at least make such a flower ing possible. There are many merits to Maslow's model. It involves a more complex and multifaceted view of human motivation, one in which psychological needs are treated as primary rather than merely derivative or artifactual. Also, man is viewed as basically healthy and positive in his relationship to life. Maslow also recognizes, as Freudians and "classical" behaviorists do not, that the motiva tional substrate of man must be hierarchically organized—that certain basic biological needs must take priority. It is a noble vision; man has the innate capability of tran scending the basic problem of personal survival and has the power to realize the sort of cultural and artistic values to which civil ized human societies have always aspired. Indeed, one detects in Maslow an echo of the "good life" that Aristotle posited in The Politics. Yet despite the many positive aspects of Maslow's model, it conflicts in some important respects with a rigorously evolu tionary perspective and, on closer inspection, involves some nor mative biases that may be questionable. A major difficulty is precisely the sort of partiality Maslow shows toward his "metamotivations." Even if we accept that such motivations do exist and that they are innate, the fact that they may seem to be ends in themselves to different individuals does not mean that they are not functionally significant (either adap tive or maladaptive) in relation to more basic survival and re productive needs. In Maslow's hierarchy, there is no inner logic, no organizing principle. Only the "deficiency needs" relate to the problem of survival; the higher needs, though equally biological in origin, are quite distinct and, presumably, frosting on the cake. But from the standpoint of the priorities and value preferences of natural selection, man's social and psychological needs (like those of any other group-living species) must be subsumed as instrumental to the continued viability of the species; it is unlikely that they would have evolved in any other way. From an evolu tionary perspective, in other words, Maslow may have his hierar</page><page sequence="31">Human Nature Redivivus 49 chy upside down. As Marx did to Hegel, it may be necessary to turn Maslow upside down—or rather, right side up.26 Another possible problem arises from the concept of self actualization. Not everyone is capable of achieving this exalted state, it seems, and those who do exhibit a puzzling ambiguity in their relationship to society. On the one hand, we are assured that self-actualized people manifest a transcending commitment to the species. Yet the emphasis is on ^//-fulfillment, while the needs and obligations to the community, one's children, and future generations are de-emphasized. There seems, indeed, to be a pos sible contradiction between lower-level needs for love and the esteem of others and the detachment and desocialization that are said to accompany self-actualization. But more to the point, Maslow's self-actualized people are committed to human betterment, yet at the same time they need not deny any of their own needs. Self-actualized people are at once hedonistic and altruistic; they can have their cake and eat it too. But are not some of our most difficult moral dilemmas com pounded out of conflicts between the individual's urge to self gratification and the pressing needs of others? Only if there were no scarcity of the resources needed for survival (and no great inequities in their distribution) could unbridled self-gratification occur without depriving others.27 But this is the nub of the pre sent political conundrum—we are confronted with an ever-in creasing number of people, a limited, if not shrinking, resource base, and gross inequities in the patterns of consumption. It must also be emphasized that Maslow's hierarchy of needs is only a first approximation. One obvious omission is the need for stimulation and goal-directed activity—a need for which we now have empirical evidence.28 A satisfactory formulation of human needs must also account for the tension, or dynamic interplay that exists among human motivations.29 For instance, Maslow's "safety needs" are very often put in jeopardy by human compet itiveness and by our propensity to seek out challenges to our capacities. To summarize, then, in none of the major alternatives to the evolutionary model is the raison d'être for human motivations, capacities, and needs made clear; human nature is not related to biological ends in a coherent way. With the possible exception of Maslow's formulation, these views of human nature treat the bio</page><page sequence="32">50 PETER A. CORNING logical realm either as irrelevant or as a necessary evil which, it is to be hoped, we can rise above. Culture is viewed as some thing which enables us to transcend our basic nature, rather than as something which is, for the most part, the servant of human nature. Finally, these models lack a sense of perspective. They lack a proper understanding of man's place in nature and of man's un avoidable subjugation to the problem of survival. Equally im portant, they lack a proper understanding of the time dimension. Neither the legacies of past generations nor the needs of future generations are appreciated or accounted for, whereas in an evolu tionary model each individual is, first and foremost, part of a collectivity and a potential link between the past and the future. Both the causes and the consequences of man's behavior must be viewed in that light. CULTURE, POLITICS, AND HUMAN NATURE Although space does not permit an extended treatment here, two other aspects of the evolutionary model of human nature should be brought into focus: namely, how are culture (includ ing cultural evolution) and politics to be comprehended and accounted for?30 First, regarding culture, it has been fashionable in recent years to define culture in linguistic ferms—to speak of the "symbol pool" of a society as being a cultural analogue of the gene pool and to identify cultural evolution with the accumulation and transmission of new symbols (new "cultural DNA"). Like so many other partial truths, such a view of culture and cultural change can be at once enlightening and misleading—if it is ac cepted without qualification. For language is only a means, albeit an important and marvelously efficient one. It facilitates culture and cultural change, but it is not the only mechanism by which cultural accretions are stored and transmitted. Nonverbal commu nications are often underrated. But more to the point, to a con siderable extent each succeeding generation rediscovers culture, or models selectively the behavior of the older generation, rather than simply absorbing culture indiscriminately. Children are not sponges; they take an active (and often quite critical) role in their own learning process.</page><page sequence="33">Human Nature Redivivus 51 Thus, the transmission of culture from one generation to the next takes place within the context of the purposeful efforts of children to acquire adaptive adult roles. (Of course, it is also true that the relative adaptiveness of different roles is partly a func tion of their intrinsic properties and partly also a reflection of the differential rewards and punishments imposed on them by so ciety.) Language is certainly an important enabler in this process, but the structural elements of culture also include knowledge, tools and material artifacts, and, most important, organization. From an evolutionary perspective, what is most significant is the way in which man puts language and knowledge and tools to use in goal-oriented social contexts—in order to satisfy his needs and wants. Just as, at the morphological level, individual traits take on significance only as functioning parts of the total pheno type, so man's purposive behavioral systems—the systems by which means are fitted to ends—represent the cultural payoffs. Furthermore, man is the quintessential cybernetic animal, solv ing problems and pursuing goals in collaboration with his fellows. Man excels at devising and playing roles in "social systems"— systems designed to achieve through collective efforts whatever ends he sets for himself. And because politics (in the broad, Aristotelian sense) is the process by which man goes about cyber nating his behavior—that is, solving "public" problems, making authoritative decisions, and organizing and coordinating the be havior of his fellows—man is distinctively a political animal. In these terms, political behavior is not confined to specialized governmental institutions. It is a facet of any organized, interper sonal activity, insofar as that activity manifests the properties of a cybernetic social system (insofar, that is, as it is goal-oriented, self-regulating, and has internal processes of communication and control among the constituent individuals). Accordingly, most complex human organizations may be said to have a political aspect, and, for analytical purposes, we could abstract the "political system" out of the stream of social activity and treat it as a "subsystem" of the total process. By the same token, other species too can be said to exhibit political behaviors. However, the repertoire of such behaviors in other species is quite limited and stereotyped by our standards. Other species cannot readily adapt their social behaviors to new goals. What sets man apart and makes him a distinctively political animal is the fact</page><page sequence="34">52 PETER A. CORNING that he has learned how to elaborate upon and adapt the basic principles of cybernetic behavioral organization—the basic social building blocks—to encompass an extraordinary variety of goals. Man alone is able to invent new and more intricate forms of organization, and the increasingly complex cybernation of human societies has been one of the most significant trends in cultural evolution. How, then, have social systems (and macrolevel governmental systems) evolved? What is the mechanism of cultural evolution? Above I suggested that natural selection involves the relationship (or the "fit") between purposive organisms and their environ ments. My argument is that precisely the same sort of relation ship is involved in cultural and political evolution. The causes of continuity and change in cultural processes are to be found neither in environmental factors nor in human mentation and action but in both—that is, in the interactions between human organisms and their various environments (cultural and natural). Changes either in the behavior of the human organism (or the collective behavior of a group of organisms) or in any of the environments in which the human organism is embedded (or changes in both, for that matter) become selectively relevant only insofar as the organism-environment relationship is significantly altered, and it is those alterations (or "variations") that are subjected to cultural "selection." Of course, natural selection has been responsible in the first instance for the emergence of the motivational and behavioral propensities of the human species and for shaping the biosphere within which man must earn his living. In addition, natural selec tion continues to pass final judgment on the various ways in which these propensities are expressed, as indicated above. But the immediate source of cultural selection is a more proximate, inter mediate mechanism that I have taken to calling "human selec tion."31 By human selection, I am referring to the processes by which human needs and wants, what Donald T. Campbell32 refers to as "internal selection criteria," "select" from ongoing behavior environment interactions. Just as natural selection refers not to the initial sources of change (say a new mutation) but to the consequences of that change, so human selection refers, not to human inventions or behavioral adaptations per se, but to selec tion based on the effects of those changes in relation to the satis</page><page sequence="35">Human Nature Redivivus 53 faction of human needs and wants. It is the perceived or actualized utility—the rewarding or reinforcing properties of the change— that counts. Artifacts and behaviors that contribute to the satis faction of human needs and wants (needs and wants whose origins are biological and a product of the evolutionary process) will be selectively favored (though, for a variety of reasons, favorable "variations" may sometimes fail to be incorporated into the cul tural system), and those that are nonrewarding, or negatively re inforcing, will be disfavored. The proposition, then, is that the variations (or pressures) that initiate cultural changes may arise from many sources: popula tion increases, depletion of an essential resource, a climatic change, a human invention, or perhaps a new survival strategy developed and organized at the group level through the political process. However, it is the differential effects (or functions) of these changes in relation to the matrix of human needs that de termines which cultural modifications will persist and contribute to the ongoing evolution of a society. Thus, "human selection," like natural selection, is a global abstraction that applies to a very wide array of phenomena. The reason why such phenomena may be classed together is that they have a functional equivalence in terms of the problem of human survival as manifested in specific human needs. There are, of course, many problems and complexities relating to the theory of cultural evolution that I have described, and I can allude to only a few of the more important issues here. 1. For one thing, there is the problem of specifying in greater detail precisely what the postulated substrate of human needs consists of and how these needs are integrated with one another. What the problem comes down to is the fact that our understand ing of the mechanisms of human selection is limited at this junc ture by the limits of our knowledge about the biopsychological bases of human motivation and learning. Of course, our under standing of the workings of natural selection is similarly limited; we are not therefore required to understand human selection com pletely in order to recognize its existence. Furthermore, as behav ioral scientists increase our understanding of the substrate of human behavior, we will, at the same time, be illuminating the mechanisms of cultural evolution. 2. Where, precisely, is the locus of human selection? Who does</page><page sequence="36">54 PETER A. CORNING the selecting? Presumably, when one is given the opportunity to do so, the locus of selection is the individual. But, as Campbell suggested, individuals do not always choose for themselves. Much human selection may be imposed on an individual by parents, teachers, coaches, employers and government officials. On the other hand, the authorities may have considerable difficulty en forcing their choices. Many individuals may resist what they perceive or experience as aversive choices made by others on their behalf. 3. How, specifically, are cultural changes diffused and re tained in the cultural system? Although data bearing on these questions are available, no one has done any systematic analysis, as far as I know. 4. The human selection model must take into account the ex istence of feedback loops, which affect the ongoing organism environment relationship. Especially important is the problem of feedback lag. Though man's behavior may have immediately re warding properties, it may also alter the natural environment in such a way as to precipitate unanticipated and possible aversive later consequences. Thus, what is adaptive in terms of the human selection model may not be adaptive in Darwinian terms—in terms of the longer-range problems of survival and reproduction. 5. Finally, there is the complicated question of how macrolevel politics and government fit into the human selection model. As I have defined the term here, political systems at the macrolevel are viewed as having primary responsibility for the collective survival strategies of human societies; they are major contributors to the process of human selection at the collective level. Accord ingly, the evolution of "government" may be viewed as the pro gressive elaboration of specialized and routinized structures for the performance of these functions. And, like other cultural accre tions, the emergence of formalized governmental institutions has in volved a cumulative (though by no means linear) process of inven tion, testing for cultural "fitness" and subsequent modification. This view of politics is not new, of course. The idea that steer ing and control functions are an "organic" and indispensable property of self-sufficient societies—whether among army ants, baboons, wolves, or men—can be traced back at least to the Greeks. Although it has not usually been expressed in precisely these terms, the notion has also been commonplace that, at least</page><page sequence="37">Human Nature Redivivus 55 in human societies, these steering functions may be performed badly or not at all; for lack of adaptive government, the collective behavior of a society might become quite detrimental to the longer-run objective of corporate survival. How one should go about making such value judgments about particular political sys tems is, of course, another matter. But such evaluations are not in principle impossible to make, and this leads us to some impli cations of the perspective that we have been advancing here. SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH We have posited here a model of human nature whose basic properties are functionally related to the fundamental prob lem of human existence. Far from being either a tabula rasa or a social artifact, human nature is basically purposive and basically oriented to biological ends (even though we are often unconscious of these ends). Human needs, human motivations, and even hu man capacities for creating and learning culture can best be un derstood as the concrete manifestations of man's nature as a hierarchically organized, self-regulating, partially autonomous (but also partially externally controlled) cybernetic system. Many of the precise properties and characteristics of this sys tem remain to be explored. What was described above was no more than an outline—a progress report on an area of behav ioral science research that is being very intensively investigated at the present time. Even so, this outline does point the way to a certain kind of research orientation with respect to the causes and consequences of social and political behavior. First, for those who are concerned particularly with causal analyses, this model suggests that social causation involves inter actions between the substrate of basic human needs (as mediated and filtered by cultures) and an array of critical environmental variables. These "master" variables include population, resources (food, water, energy, hard minerals, and so forth), various pro perties of the natural environment, technology and social organi zation. Furthermore, these variables act (and interact) in com plex and configurai ways, with many nonlinear aspects. In other words, Malthus (who identified the population-resource nexus), Marx (who concentrated on changes in the "mode of production</page><page sequence="38">56 PETER A. CORNING of material life") and Aristotle (who viewed politics as an inde pendent variable) were each partially correct about the locus of social causation. But these several variables are causally signifi cant only insofar as they affect (and in turn are affected by) hu man efforts to satisfy human needs (and wants). The problem for social science research is thus twofold. Not only must we attempt a more precise specification of the configuration of human needs (the "reference signals") but we must get a much better fix than we have obtained heretofore on the relevant "exogenous" variables. We need to enlarge our view of what constitutes the relevant human environment and to learn more about the specific parameters of the survival problem for man and how these sur vival imperatives shape our survival strategies. A second major research implication that may be drawn from the model above has to do with the role of biological "forces" in behavioral causation. The model suggests that we should not rule out such influences in principle, but neither should we jump to any conclusions. We have only just begun to explore the biology of human behavior—the extent to which biological characteristics may create behavioral "imperatives," bias learning processes, pre determine which kinds of environmental experiences will be re inforcing, set boundaries and limits on cultural manipulations, and contribute significantly to the many individual differences we observe in behavior. If we can as yet draw only a limited number of firm conclusions, nonetheless we may legitimately anticipate that more will be forthcoming. For those who are concerned with functional analyses, and with policy issues, on the other hand, the basic problem is how to measure adaptation. Is it possible to develop some sort of profile of what constitutes adaptiveness in human societies which could be used as a baseline for evaluating specific cases? It is indeed strange (and a token of our theoretical confusion) that we do not have available even a consensually acceptable first approxi mation; we have no systematic way of measuring adaptation. In fact, we are not even agreed upon what unit (or level) of analysis we should be employing. Should we be concerned with each in dividual member of a society or with certain collective properties? And, if the latter, which of the many different kinds of human collectivities should we focus upon? For more than two centuries, Western societies have, in effect,</page><page sequence="39">Human Nature Redivivus 57 relied on narrowly economic measures of adaptiveness. To the classical economists, the relevant unit of analysis was the individ ual, and the most important criterion of "success" was the indi vidual's return on his invested capital or his labor. The presump tion was that the sum of all the individual "goods" would auto matically produce the collective welfare. We have learned that this is not necessarily so. For instance, the sum of many individ ual choices to have more children could be a collective "bad"— a Malthusian disaster, in fact. Modern industrial societies have come to rely on various ag gregate economic measures—gross national product, income per capita, and so forth. And yet, these measures have proved to be equally deficient if not, to some extent, actually misleading. For one thing, a statistic like GNP is so constructed that it treats as a "good' the wasteful squandering of resources on conspicuous con sumption; it tells us nothing about how sensibly we are using non renewable resources. Indeed, husbanding resources and reducing unnecessary consumption would reflect negatively upon the GNP. Nor, as we have learned in recent years, does GNP tell us any thing about how well we are doing with respect to noneconomic aspects of the problem of adaptation—aspects that economists have traditionally treated as "externalities." In some instances, these adaptively significant externalities seem to have been ad versely affected in an almost perfectly inverse relationship to im provements in the GNP. Economic "goods," in short, may pro duce adaptive "bads." By the same token, a measure such as aver age income per capita can obscure the maladaptive consequences of a highly skewed distribution of income within a society: while there may be a few members who are very rich, many more may be ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed. In recent years, some anthropologists have sought more subtle ways of measuring adaptiveness, such as energy flows, or various criteria of environmental "mastery" (for instance, the proportion of the population engaged in the food quest, relative freedom from environmental variation, more substitutions and alternatives for meeting needs, greater knowledge of cause and effect, etc.). Criteria of this kind are, in reality, derived from major properties of Western societies, but such ethnocentrism begs the question. Are Western industrial societies better adapted? Do we indeed have greater mastery over the problem of survival, or are past</page><page sequence="40">58 PETER A. CORNING and present adaptive successes unstable? Over the longer run, it is possible that the survival strategies we have been pursuing will lead us into a cul de sac, or at very least may have to be modified significantly. Furthermore, we remain unenlightened about the relationship between populations and their resource bases. Is a proper balance being maintained? And are goods and services being distributed in such a way that individual needs are being satisfied? There may be, in sum, a significant difference between what we are doing and what we need to do in order to ensure continued survival. In reality, there are two problems, or rather two levels upon which adaptiveness can be measured. Because reproducing pop ulations, or "demes", are the most important unit of biological adaptation over the long haul—and because demes have many collective properties that can only be adequately evaluated at the collective level, some measure or measures of collective adaptive ness is an important desideratum. Aggregate economic measures or measures that use industrial societies as a baseline may not be satisfactory, but the search for better holistic measures should be encouraged. At the same time, since adaptation is also a prob lem for each individual, finer-grained measures of adaptation— ones that would enable us to tell how well any given individual is doing—are also relevant. Accordingly, a first step might be further efforts to develop a set of criteria for determining what is the "optimum" human population size for a given environment. Such an estimate would necessarily involve a synthesis of several different criteria of op timality, and each estimate would be specific to a particular en vironment. It might also change through time, as conditions change. It would thus be a very dynamic and multidimensional measuring rod. In addition, an array of "indicators" might be developed that would reflect several specific dimensions of the total process of human adaptation. These could include economic indicators, so cial indicators, ecological indicators, health indicators, and even genetic indicators. The matter of what constitutes the most appropriate popula tion "boundary" might also be handled in a flexible way. In theory, the relevant population should be that unit which, in a given instance, is essentially autonomous and self-sufficient with</page><page sequence="41">Human Nature Redivivus 59 respect to all of the major dimensions of the survival problem. In practice, it is often very difficult to make such a determination unambiguously. To an increasing degree, the autonomous unit varies with different dimensions of the survival problem. Also, the patterns of autonomy and interdependence are rapidly changing. In order to measure adaptation at the individual level, on the other hand, an effort might be made to develop at least a crude profile of individual needs (both biological and "psychological"). Rather than using a single, standardized profile, though, one might anticipate a "set" of profiles that would accommodate, within some maximum range of variation, the many individual and cul tural differences that exist. Such an enterprise would be enor mously ambitious and fraught with uncertainties and subjectivity. However, we would at least be focusing on the right questions— and on the "right" model of human nature. SOME NORMATIVE IMPLICATIONS Is there a general welfare—a summum bonum? And, equally important, does an evolutionary view of man provide an answer to Albert Schweitzer's challenge at the start of this essay? Can we discern a transcendent social purpose for human strivings and accomplishments? It all depends upon how one views the evolutionary process and man's place in it. Schweitzer's anguished search for meaning has been shared by many modern thinkers, particularly those who have felt compelled by the victory of Darwinism to reject notions of a divine purpose or "Natural Law." Some have been led by the evidence of evolution to conclude that man must there fore be the product of a meaningless and even capricious process. Molecular biologist (and Nobel Laureate) Jacques Monod echoes this sentiment in his recent book, Chance and Necessity: "Pure chance, absolutely free but blind, [is] at the very root of the stu pendous edifice of evolution."33 However, such an extreme view overlooks an important dimen sion of the process. Chance, or nonpurposive changes (such as genetic mutations), may produce the raw material of evolution, but it is natural selection that steers the ultimate course. And natural selection is basically utilitarian. As Dobzhansky observes, "natural selection is an anti-chance agency."34 Furthermore, nat</page><page sequence="42">60 PETER A. CORNING ural selection has through time produced in Homo sapiens a creature that is not only purposive but self-aware and creative— a creature that is increasingly capable of understanding and exert ing influence (for better or worse) over the evolutionary process itself. Only if we were to assume that man is helpless to guide his own fate could self-pity and inaction be countenanced. And only if we were to assume that the survival problem has somehow been "solved" could we feel complacent about man's fate. But neither assumption is warranted by the evidence. The most compelling lesson of the multiple crises we have been experiencing these past few years is that the survival of the species as a corporate entity is at very least a continuing adventure, if not a relentless and inescapable challenge. (There is, indeed, con siderable irony in the fact that, for as far into the future as we can peer at this point, the greatest threat to mankind is man.) Not only is the outcome of the human adventure not predeter mined, but human choices and actions must be counted among the many partial determinants of the ongoing process. (In fact, it is well to keep in mind that even our assumptions about the very long run—our assumptions about the finite life of the solar sys tem—are based on something less than perfect human knowledge of the cosmos.) Not until the evolutionary adventure has actually been played out will we or our descendants know the ultimate fate of the human species. In short, the future is not vouchsafed by any law of nature (much less any law of history), but it may be striven for; it is within our power to further this adventure, if we so choose. Dobzhansky notes: Man and his place in nature can be seen in a different light if mankind is evolving, or can be made to evolve, towards some thing better than it is at present. The fundamental fact is that when mankind discovered that it had evolved, it ceased to be a flotsam carried helplessly on the evolutionary current. It can now aspire to steer for directions man himself chooses, if need be against the current.35 Because of the very nature of human nature, each of us is, whether we like it or not, a steward of the human species. Each of us represents a link in a long biological (and cultural) chain and each is in a sense a vessel—a bearer (with modifications) of</page><page sequence="43">Human Nature Redivivus 61 legacies passed down to us against very long odds by ancestors who fought the good fight and managed to endure. Of course, the fact of this inheritance cannot logically bind us to any normative imperatives. There is no Natural Law that com pels us to accept a fiduciary responsibility for future generations. And yet, we cannot escape the fact that many of our actions, in dividually and collectively, do affect the future of the species. In other words, whether or not we choose to accept a conscious obli gation for the future, we cannot avoid the blame for it. The philosophers tell us that we cannot infer moral obligations, or "oughts," from any fact in the empirical world, from what "is." Science may be able to explain how things work, but it cannot tell us how we should live our lives. In practice, though, this logical gulf between facts and values (the so-called "Is-Ought" dichotomy)36 has been bridged for many of us by the psycho logical realities—by the fact that we are endowed with a strong compulsion to survive (and survival is a prerequisite for any other value choices), and by the subjective sense of obligation that we normally feel at least to our immediate forebears and to our immediate progeny. In a passage reminiscent of Edmund Burke, Walter Lippmann several years ago captured this sentiment with great poignancy: Besides the happiness and the security of the individuals of whom a community is at any moment composed, there are also the happiness and security of the individuals of whom genera tion after generation it will be composed. . . . That is why young men die in battle for their country's sake and why old men plant trees they will never sit under.37 Accordingly, the general welfare is not a figment of our imagi nation, nor a product of a naive idealism, nor yet the cunning ploy of a self-serving political or economic elite. If we include all of the potential members of future generations among those whose interests may be affected by our actions in this generation, then the aggregated interests of those who are yet to be born out weigh by a very wide margin either the interests of any living individual, or even the "collective goods," as political economists use the term,38 of all living souls. And it is those aggregated future interests that constitute the general welfare. To the extent that we</page><page sequence="44">62 PETER A. CORNING so tailor our value choices and actions that we are striving, to the very limit of our capacity for intelligent planning and fore sight, to maximize the long-run survival chances of the species, only then can it be said that we are acting in accordance with the general welfare. Yet even if we are ready and willing to accept the ukase that we must subordinate our interests to the future interests of the species, how do we translate our very uncertain notions about what the needs of subsequent generations will be into a concrete framework of social and political values? On the one hand, we face the problem of specifying individual "rights" and "duties" in a way that will best serve the welfare of those who may come after us, and, on the other hand, we need to develop criteria and objectives to guide collective (or political) decision-making. Al though a full discussion of these issues is not possible here, cer tain basic guideposts may be set forth. I suggested above that survival is at once an individual and a collective affair—the two levels of adaptation are neither wholly distinct nor wholly concordant. To a considerable extent, the sa tisfaction of individual needs also furthers the interests of the collective survival enterprise. At the same time, transcendent "species needs" may directly conflict with individual self-gratifi cation. The most conclusive example relates to resource consump tion. If a critical nonrenewable resource is consumed without be ing recycled (or else replaced by a suitable substitute), a direct cost is imposed on subsequent generations. Such actions amount to the payoffs in a zero-sum game in which our descendants lose whatever "goods" we gain. Only the recycling or replacement of resources (or sustained yield exploitation of renewable resources) can be considered adaptive—that is, in harmony with the general welfare. From an evolutionary perspective, both our "rights" and our "duties" derive from our status as bearers of our evolutionary heritage and as potential contributors (biologically and/or cul turally, since cultural legacies are also important for man) to the future of the species, to the general welfare. Insofar as both per sonal freedom and social constraints (or, more broadly, self-serv ing as well as altruistic behaviors) may advance the general wel fare, both are justified. As I noted elsewhere:</page><page sequence="45">Human Nature Redivivus 63 there is no clearcut ethical dichotomy between the individual and the group. Rather, the problem is one of maintaining a dynamic balance between the two, a balance that may have to be adjusted frequently in order to sustain the adaptiveness of a society. The proper balance is not something that can be de termined a priori in all cases. Each problem, or type of prob lem, may have to be weighed separately. But in theory, at least, there would appear to be three possible forms of self-serving behavior: 1) that which also contributes to the welfare of the group; 2) that which is neutral in its effects on the group; and 3) that which is maladaptive, or detrimental to the long-run survival potential of the group.39 But how do we go about finding the proper balance? The gen eral welfare, as we have defined it here, is not necessarily asso ciated with any particular economic or political system. Nor does it necessarily have either "conservative" or "radical" political im plications. Depending upon the context, either continuities or changes in a society might be adaptive, and both should be judged by the same yardstick—their contribution to the collective survival enterprise; the goal in either event should be to maximize our ability to meet the basic needs of present and future generations. However, given our very imperfect knowledge of what will best serve the needs of our remote descendants, George Wald has sug gested that we use as a seat-of-the-pants criterion for social choice whatever is perceived to be best for the children of a society. He asks, are nuclear weapons good for children? Or is pollution? Or the wanton and wasteful squandering of resources? Or a value system that permits a society to pay entertainers vastly more than it pays educators? What, more specifically, should be the "ideal" goals of a so ciety that aspires to act in accordance with the general welfare? First, there should be a stable relationship with the basic life-sup port system upon which we are dependent. Second, the economy should be reorganized for long-term stability rather than growth; the emphasis should be upon maintaining our capital stock, rather than upon maximizing throughputs (as the economists would say). Third, there should be an approximation of the Marxian dictum "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!" And fourth, there should be a harmonious social and</page><page sequence="46">64 PETER A. CORNING political order. Indeed, we might strive to approximate (insofar as we are able) the Platonic ideal—a society in which a mesh is achieved between the needs and abilities of individual citizens and the needs of society. The leadership of such a society would also be required to have an unwavering commitment to the general wel fare—and the requisite ability to act upon it. For a society such as ours, this prescription, even if only par tially realized, would require fundamental changes in our values, our economic system, and our politics. It would mean, at least for the upper strata in our society, considerably less freedom to pur sue self-gratifications and considerably more personal constraint and social discipline. Because our society has generally permitted its political leaders to act as if the political realm were analogous to a capitalist market—as if the functions of leadership amounted to serving as a kind of broker between contending interest groups —it would mean that we would have to accept considerably more political "steering," or political "cybernation," than we have been accustomed to. There would be more planning and political con trol, not less. Such a prescription would, in short, be incompatible with "radical" freedom and infantile utopianism. Is even an approximation of such a political vision practicable? Is it realistic to think that people in our society would ever be willing to make such fundamental changes in their way of life and their public philosophy? Is it not naïve to think that people would ever accept a heavy new burden of social duties and con straints? Who is to do the political steering? And who will guard the guardians? In the wake of Watergate, would anyone argue that we have solved the classic problems of political engineering, the rock upon which Plato himself foundered? How does one de sign an economic and political system that can compensate for human frailties and ensure political "outputs" that accord with the general welfare? There is no ready answer. And yet, we confront increasingly urgent ecological imperatives (the population-resource-environ ment nexus), and they are forcing us to the wall. The time is rapidly approaching when we (and other Western societies as well) will be compelled to make drastic changes. The real issue is not whether radical changes are desirable or possible. The choice we confront is between radical changes by incremental means and radical changes by radical means. We can make the</page><page sequence="47">Human Nature Redivivus 65 transition to "Spaceship Earth," in Kenneth Boulding's phrase, in such a way as to minimize hardships and preserve, as far as pos sible, the best values of Western civilization. Or, we can be over whelmed with convulsive events that will surely exact a fearful toll in human suffering and evoke Draconian, or even totalitarian, responses. As Mort Sahl would say, the future lies ahead. Will we get there under the guidance of clear objectives and intelligent planning, or will we find ourselves blindly groping, with increas ing desperation, for a way out of a situation that is out of control? In place of either the dogma of self-sustained progress or Utopian fantasies based on Enlightenment or nineteenth-century optimism, what we need at this point are hard and disciplined efforts to model a realizable and adaptive future—and a set of strategies for implementing it. (In the truest sense, what we re quire is "neogenesis"—new forms of biological organization.) This must be based on a sensitive understanding of the natural environment, a balanced "best guess" assessment of human nature and human needs, and a sophisticated understanding of economic and political realities. If there is to be controlled, adaptive change, we will need, above all, extraordinarily gifted and dedicated leadership. This has been the indispensable element in all of the great "revitaliza tion movements" of the modern era, and we have no reason to believe that we will be able to do without it in the period of tran sition that lies ahead. Whether we will be fortunate enough to have it when we need it remains to be seen. But one thing is cer tain, we will have to organize ourselves if we hope to save our selves. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1.

The simplified formula for heritability is: lr = Vg Let us consider a hy v7 pothetical study in which two different populations are sampled. In each sample, the actual amount of biological variation is quite large. But in one case the environmental variation is even larger, so that the biolog ical variation turns out to be a relatively small proportion of the total variation. For the second sample, though, the environment is quite uni form, so that most of the observed phenotypic variation is biologically based. Accordingly, the heritabilities for these two biologically similar samples might be, say, .3 and .8 respectively. Since heritabilities can neve be greater than unity (or 1.0), this is a substantial difference— 50% to be precise. Conversely, two samples that are quite different from each other biologically might yield identical heritability estimates if the environments were sufficiently different from each other to make bio logical differences proportionately the same. 13.

I hasten to emphasize that this is not a veiled argument in favor of so cial or economic exploitation and injustice. Hierarchy here refers to task-specific organizational functions, or "roles." Hierarchy is not, in the natural world, an end in itself, nor is it necessarily related to indi vidual advantage. 19. See Corning, "The Biological Bases of Behavior and Some Implications for Political Science," op. cit., and "Comparative Survival Strategies," op. cit. See note 4 above. 20. The concept of "adaptiveness" is explored at length in Corning, "Com parative Survival Strategies," op. cit. 21. Since the "fit" between what is adaptive for the individual and what is adaptive for the collectivity is often imperfect, this creates a difficult optimization problem for social species in general and for human so cities in particular. This issue will be discussed further below. 22.

Though it is not pertinent here, it is worth noting that several differ ent models have been developed to describe the workings of natural se lection among various population aggregates. 25. Maslow's five categories consist of the following: (1) physiological needs; (2) safety needs; (3) "belongingness" and love needs; (4) es teem needs; and (5) self-actualization needs. Abraham Maslow, Mo tivation and Personality (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1954), pp. 80ff. 26. To some, this line of reasoning may seem to threaten Western cultural values, but such is not necessarily the case. An explanation of how our psychological characteristics and abilities evolved does not require a normative judgment about them. Nor does an evolutionary explanation of the origins of these traits imply that they are always adaptive. 27. We will skirt in the present discussion the gloomy postulate that at least some men may be so designed that they can achieve certain kinds of self-gratifications only at the expense of others. 28.

This point is also discussed by Gerald Cory in "The Biopsychological Basis of Political Socialization and Political Culture" (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Stanford, 1974). 30. The following is derived from a more lengthy discussion of these mat ters in Peter A. Corning "Politics and the Evolutionary Process," Evo lutionary Biology (VII) (New York: Plenum Press, 1974). 31.

Actually, mutations at the molecular level are not the only source of the variations that fuel evolutionary change. Nor are such mutations strictly speaking random in nature. Compared to the infinity of theoretical possibilities, only a very limited number of nucleotide substitutions are possible in any given gene at a particular moment in time. 35. Ibid., p. 377. 36.

"Collective' goods" involve benefits that are indivisible and that are jointly supplied to all members of the community. No individual can be excluded from such benefits and no individual can appropriate them for himself. The most commonly cited example is national defense.
