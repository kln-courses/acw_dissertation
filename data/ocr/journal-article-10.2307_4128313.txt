<plain_text><page sequence="1">Saltwater People: spiritscapes, maritime rituals and the archaeology of Australian indigenous seascapes lan J. McNiven Abstract Anthropological research reveals that the scale and complexity of Australian indigenous seascapes correlate with the scale and complexity of spiritual engagements with the sea and use of its resources. Marine specialists see and represent themselves as Saltwater People - an identification spiritually embedded within seascapes rich in cosmological meaning. For Aboriginal people, this embeddedness is underwritten by a Dreaming cosmology that formalizes seascapes as spiritscapes engaged through ritual performance. Such maritime rituals occur on the water, on tidal flats or on dry land. Rituals are the social mechanism by which Saltwater Peoples (Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders) spiritually manage and control their seas and ultimately orchestrate their seascapes. As such, an archaeology of seascapes is more than an archaeology of marine subsistence and procurement technology; it must also be an archaeology of spiritscapes and rituals that mediate human spiritual relationships with the sea. Because ritual sites often have a material expression, it is possible to investigate such sites archaeologically. This scope opens the possibility of investigating long-term developments in people's spiritual attachments to the sea and how seascapes were cosmologically constructed in a broad range of cultural settings. A new hypothesis associating spiritual control of extreme tidal regimes with previously enigmatic marine stone arrangements from central Queensland illustrates the potential value of the spiritscape approach to seascapes.

McNiven An archaeology of sea peoples has hitherto largely been an archaeology of subsistence (i.e. marine foods) and procurement technology (e.g. fish hooks, fishtraps, etc). Yet ask Australian indigenous marine specialists ('Saltwater People') what it means to be a people of the sea and your answer will extend beyond meals and menus. In her recent book on indigenous coastal peoples of northern Australia, anthropologist Nonie Sharp (2002) reveals that the essence of being a 'Saltwater' person is more ontological than technolog- ical. It is about how you spiritually relate to the sea and engage with spiritual forces that create it and you. For many mariners around the world, technological aids such as hydrographic maps, depth sounders and GPS units mediate engagements with the sea. For the Western world, seas are to be tamed to aid transit and exploitation of resources. Perhaps it is for this reason that Western maritime heritage and archaeology focus on technological aids (e.g. lighthouses) and sites where the sea has beaten us (e.g. ship- wrecks). In this sense, the 'modern' seascape is constructed as a techno-scape, where sites such as RMS Titanic taunt us over our desire for domination of the seas (McNiven 1996). In contrast, Australia's indigenous Saltwater Peoples construct their seascapes as spirit- scapes imbued with spiritual forces that can be engaged ritually. This paper develops a conceptual framework for investigating the archaeology of Australian indigenous seascapes. It follows David's (2002) recent archaeological study of ontology and Australian indigenous ritual and symbolic landscapes, and my own research on hunting magic and spiritscapes in Torres Strait (McNiven and Feldman 2003). I shall argue that an archaeology of seascapes needs to extend beyond subsistence and technology and investi- gate spiritscapes and associated ritual sites used to manage and control the sea spiritually. I illustrate the potentials of this approach using marine stone arrangements from the tropical coast of central Queensland. Saltwater People and their seascapes Most Australian indigenous coastal peoples exhibit 'mixed economies' of marine and terrestrial animal foods. However, marine specialists (Saltwater Peoples) with worldviews and everyday practices that focus on the marine environment are limited mostly to tropical northern Australia (Hall and McNiven 1999; Peterson and Rigsby 1998a; Sharp 2002). Torres Strait Islanders of northeastern Australia are marine specialists par excel- lence, using more than 450 species of marine animals (Johannes and MacFarlane 1991; McNiven and Hitchcock in press) (Fig. 1). As Cordell put it, Torres Strait Islanders are 'one of the most marine-oriented and sea-life dependent indigenous societies on the planet' (1993: 159). Such marine specialization among Saltwater People is possible only with specialized technology and intimate knowledge of the sea accumulated over thou- sands of years. In northeast Australia, groups variously developed elaborate outrigger canoes to visit offshore islands and harpoons to hunt marine mammals and turtles (Barham 2000; Rowland 1987). Specialized environmental knowledge concerns not only seasonal cycles and the ecology of plants and animals, but also long- and short-term weather and tidal cycles (Memmott and Trigger 1998; Nietschmann 1989). For many groups of Saltwater People, this detailed knowledge is extended over hundreds and in some cases thousands of square kilometres of sea. Not surprisingly, these seas are</page><page sequence="3">Saltwater People 331 Q4iz~ ci;:6'i' i iKiwal sLand lGf oof SYork 0 Peninsula I NORTHERN TERRITORY Percy Islands Shoalwater QUEENSLAND Bay WESTERN AUSTRALIA SUHBrisbane SOUTH AUSTRALIA - ."

The seas of the Yanyuwa people in the southern part of the Gulf of Carpentaria have over forty named reefs and sea grass beds (Bradley 1998). The Goemulag, who inhabit the small island of Mabuiag (6km2) in western Torres Strait, have over 100 named places (mostly reefs, channels and islets) across more than 600km2 of territorial seas (Davis and Prescott 1992; Taranto et al. 1997). Offshore island use provides one of the clearest indicators of the potential spatial scale of Australian indigenous seascapes both past and present. For those mainland groups whose exploitation of the sea was limited to littoral resources, it is likely that seascapes extended no more than c. 20-30km out to sea, out to the horizon and the limit of human visibility (Memmott and Trigger 1998; Peterson and Rigsby 1998b). This situation is applicable to most coastal Aboriginal groups of southern Australia (see Freslov and Frankel 1999; Jones 1976: McNiven 2000). However, in some coastal places, clouds that can be seen well over 100km out to sea are imbued with spiritual significance (Memmott and Trigger 1998). For those groups with elaborate canoe technology, seascapes extend</page><page sequence="4">332 Ian J. McNiven well over the horizon. For example, the Darumbal of central Queensland ventured 40km off the Shoalwater Bay coast to High Peak Island (McNiven 1999a). Immediately to the north, shell middens on the Percy Islands show that Aboriginal people canoed 58km out from the mainland (Border 1999), the furthest offshore voyaging known for Aboriginal Australians. Even with island hopping, one part of the trip to the Percy Islands requires an open sea voyage of 27km (Border 1999: 133). As Rowland (1984) cogently notes, this is a 'long way in a bark canoe'. Most extreme of all were Torres Strait Islanders who, using elaborate 15-20m-long dugout canoes fitted with sails and outriggers, travelled more than 300km down the east coast of Cape York Peninsula along the Great Barrier Reef to quarry both tool stone from off-shore islands and metal from European shipwrecks (McNiven 1998, 2001). Despite insights into indigenous marine economies, comparatively little research has been directed towards the ontological question of how marine specialists perceived the sea and conceptually constructed their seascapes. In Australia, coastal archaeologists focus on middens and modelling chronological changes in settlement and subsistence (Hall and McNiven 1999), while anthropologists have traditionally focused on terrestrial (landscape) issues, even in situations where coastal peoples have been studied (Pannell 1998; Peterson and Rigsby 1998b; cf. Johannes and MacFarlane 1991; Meehan 1982; Thomson 1934). Despite these research patterns, the last twenty years have seen increasing numbers of researchers (all anthropologists) examine 'customary marine tenure' and the ways Saltwater Peoples construct seascapes rich in cosmological meaning (Peterson and Rigsby 1998a; Sharp 2002; cf. Barker 1998; McNiven and Feldman 2003). As Pannell (1998) points out, some of this interest extended from broader research interests in sea management systems following the world fisheries crisis of the 1970s and passage of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (see Cordell 1989; McGoodwin 1990; Ruddle and Akimichi 1984; United Nations 1983). However, the major impetus came from a need to explicate anthropologically demands by various Saltwater Peoples for legal recognition of Native Title rights to their seas. These demands followed in the wake of the landmark Mabo courtcase of 1992 and subsequent Native Title Act 1993 that overturned the 'colonial fantasy' (Pannell 1998: 245) and legal fiction that Australia, prior to European settlement in 1788, was terra nullius ('a land of no-one'). Key to this new anthropological understanding of Aboriginal Saltwater Peoples is recognition of seascapes as spiritscapes that encapsulate formal links between Dreaming cosmologies, customary marine tenure and identity. Seascapes as animated spiritscapes Seascapes concern more than marine subsistence. This paper takes the view that seascapes are defined by cosmologies that frame and constrain perception, engagement and use of seas. Seascapes are animated spiritscapes because ancestor spirits - both creator beings and the 'Old People' - imbue seas with spiritual energies, fecundity and sentience. Certain features of the sea, such as islands, sandbanks, reefs, rock outcrops, tides and currents, along with sea creatures, are often seen as the result of creative acts by ancestral beings during a mythical past (designated the Dreaming or Dreamtime for Aboriginal Australia). For many groups, these features are visual manifestations of the</page><page sequence="5">Saltwater People 333 ancestral beings themselves. Some ancestral beings created seabed features (e.g. chan- nels) when areas were once dry land - a possible reference to periods of lower sea level more than 6000 years ago (Cooke and Armstrong 1998; Memmott and Trigger 1998). In other situations, features spread across tens and even hundreds of kilometres of sea are associated with particular Dreaming creative acts. For example, the Yanyuwa recount the mythic journey of the Spirit Ancestor Dugong Hunters for a distance of 110km through the Sir Edward Pellew Island Group. The journey pathway is marked by over fifty named places on islands and in the sea (Bradley 1998). Far from being relics of a mythical past, the cultural significance of Dreaming sites stems from their ongoing spiritual energies and life forces. Spiritual energies and sentience are also associated with seawater. The sea is a dynamic medium with constantly changing colours, temperatures, waves, currents and tides. It is also a giver of life and a taker of life. The capricious nature of the sea, appreciated by all mariners, is consistent with a sea animated by sentient spiritual beings. Among the Gidjingali of Arnhem Land, seawater and waves are imbued with spiritual essences that are expressed anthropomorphically as 'habitual speaking' (beach surf) and 'habitual walking' (currents) (Bagshaw 1998: 159). In Torres Strait, the Kaurareg reveal that the mythical warrior Waubin created the strong current running through Prince of Wales Channel to 'discourage outsiders from venturing .. . into the Kaurareg area' (Southon et al. 1998: 221). Aboriginal people on the Kimberley coast (NW Australia) associate tidal movements in the Cambridge Gulf with the actions of Lumiri, a large saltwater snake (Elkin 1930). Among the Yolngu of Arnhem Land, the 'ebb and flow of tide are often re-enacted at the beginning and end of ritual song cycles and dances' (Buku-Larrngay Mulka Centre 1999: 62). Stone-walled tidal fishtraps, the largest single facilities built by indigenous Australians, are often attributed to the creative acts of mythical beings. The Ganggalida (southern Gulf of Carpentaria) recount how certain fishtraps were made by people using stones representing the metamorphosed remains of a dugong (Robins et al. 1998). Two mythical brothers, Kos and Abob, constructed fishtraps (sai) according to the people of Mer in eastern Torres Strait (Lawrie 1970). Saltwater People, like all Aboriginal people, believe they share the world with spirits of the dead (the 'old people') (e.g. Langton 2002). Sometimes these spirits travel to remote locations (e.g. mountains, offshore islands) to dwell - either on their own accord or with the assistance of the living through specially performed (mortuary) rituals. On the coast of western Victoria, Gundidjmara people talked of a cave called Tarn wirring ('road of the spirits') through which spirits of the dead travelled on their way to Dhinmar (Lady Julia Percy Island) located 8km out to sea (Dawson 1881; Mathews 1904). Mabuiag Islanders of Torres Strait recall how markai ('ghost' people) reside to the west on the 'mythical' island of Kibu ('land of dead spirits') (Fitzpatrick 1980: 144; Haddon 1904: 355-6). However, waterspouts are seen as facilities used by markai to harpoon dugongs and turtles as they travel across the sea (Haddon 1904: 356). Markai could also paddle canoes on 'the open sea on calm nights to catch turtle, dugong or fish' (Haddon 1904: 358). The people of Goulburn Island off Arnhem Land identify Wulurunbu and Lingardji as submerged islands 'inhabited by the spirits of the dead' (Cooke and Armstrong 1998: 179). The spirits of recent dead Ganggalida dwell in a place 'described in English' as 'the middle of the sea'</page><page sequence="6">334 Ian J. McNiven (Robins et al. 1998: 85). These examples reveal that a Saltwater person can never be alone while out on the sea. Seascapes, tenure and identity Aboriginal Saltwater People - people whose worldviews are closely referenced to the sea - have an intimate spiritual relationship with the sea founded upon 'consubstantial iden- tification' with Dreaming creator beings (Bagshaw 1998: 156). Spiritual attachment to particular Dreaming beings and their spatial referents (places) is legitimated through inheritance (usually patrilineal) and is the ontological basis for clan estate ownership and land/sea tenure. Often it is the geographical dimension of particular Dreaming stories that defines the spatial parameters and territorial limits of clan estates both on land and across the sea. The spiritual anchoring of some Aboriginal people to particular sections of sea also operates through 'conception filiation' (Merlan 1986). For example, among the Yawuru of the Kimberley coast, a woman becomes pregnant once a 'spirit child' (rai) enters her body (Sullivan 1998: 102). Some spirit children emanate from special sites and 'many of these sites are located in the sea, usually in coastal reefs and rocks'. Yolngu (Arnhem Land) Elder Gawirrin Gumana describes one such 'birthplace' in the sea, 'marked by submerged rocks', as a 'reservoir of souls' (Buku-Larrngay Mulka Centre 1999: 42). Among the Kaiadilt of the southern part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, spiritual conception is linked to totemic entities such as bijarrba (dugong), dibidibi (rock cod) and kulkiji (shark). These totemic entities not only intimately link people to place, and people to marine creatures as kin, but also provide a life-long association between people and 'an invisible but co-existing spiritual world' (Memmott and Trigger 1998: 119). A person can have spiritual attachments to more than one clan estate, particularly if their 'conception' site is located outside their inherited clan estate. In a different context, the nearby Lardil people identify three rocks protruding from the sea at the eastern end of Mornington Island as the 'bodies of their ancestors, the first humans who came into their country' (Memmott and Trigger 1998: 119). Across Torres Strait, Islanders have an elaborate system of customary marine tenure that involves the largest indigenous territorial seas in Australia. This tenure operates at different scales of increasing inclusiveness - household, clan, island community, island (sub-cultural) group and Torres Strait Islander cultural area (Scott and Mulrennan 1999: 153). Associations between various Islander groups and particular tracks of sea (particu- larly reef systems) are enshrined in, and validated by, creation myths that act as 'oral deeds of title' (Scott and Mulrennan 1999: 155). Certain clans are associated with particular myths and senior members of clans have the right to 'tell, sing and dance' the story of these myths (Scott and Mulrennan 1999: 159). Clans also are associated with particular totems that include a range of sea animals such as dhangal (dugong), waru (turtle), kodal (crocodile) and kaigas (shovel-nosed shark) (Haddon 1935: 56-7). Compli- cations and contestations over sea tenure arise for a range of reasons, including ambigu- ities over group/myth association, rules of inheritance and boundaries due to overlapping tenures (Scott and Mulrennan 1999). It is for this reason that sea tenure, like land tenure for many Aboriginal groups, is often a negotiated process. Generally, social boundaries in the sea (deep waters) are not marked physically due to practical constraints. However,</page><page sequence="7">Saltwater People 335 shallow reef systems, particularly home reefs surrounding islands in eastern Torres Strait, can be marked with rock walls hundreds of metres long that also function as tidal fishtraps (Scott and Mulrennan 1999). On Erub Island, fishtraps have individual names and are owned by individuals. Similar custodial rights over fishtraps exist among Aboriginal groups in the Gulf of Carpentaria (Memmott and Trigger 1998; Robins et al. 1998). Interestingly, individuals on Mabuiag Island in western Torres Strait had, during the early European contact period of the nineteenth century, the right to 'appropriate to their own use' sailing ships wrecked on reefs for which they held custodial rights (Haddon 1904: 289). Seascapes: contexts for maritime rituals Among Aboriginal people, Dreaming cosmologies spiritually link people, places and animals, and in the process imbue clans with sacred law. This law maintains 'cosmological order', is legitimated 'in and by the Dreaming' and is operationalized through inherited and inalienable possessory rights, rules and responsibilities (David 2002: 24). Rules, as codified behaviours, are the proper, circumscribed and appropriate ways of doing things. For this paper, some of the most important rules concern respecting rights and fulfilling responsibilities towards the sea. Respecting rights concerns ownership, control and use of clan estates (lands and seas), resources, Dreaming stories, songs, rituals, dances, ritual paraphernalia and sacred designs (often seen as 'title deeds'). For example, access to clan estates requires permission following negotiation with appropriate clan leaders. Apart from showing respect and good manners, permission also ensures that visitors are not harmed by inadvertently going too close to spiritually dangerous places (Palmer 1998). Fulfilling responsibilities (often referred to as sacred duties and obligations) usually falls on the shoulders of clan leaders/Elders ('lawmen'). Responsibilities involve the proper management and welfare of people and clan estates. The latter concerns land- and seascapes and the 'spiritual renewal of the land and sea through the practice of ritual, the maintenance of ritual objects and the singing of songs and performance of ceremonies' (Palmer 1998: 149). This spiritual renewal relates to maintaining fecundity of the land and sea (with 'increase' rites - see below) and celebrating the creative acts of ancestral beings (with ceremonies that often involve re-enacting these creative acts through ritual song and dance). As such, spiritual renewal is central to reaffirming the cosmological position and identity of people in a spiritscape. People ritually engage with spiritscapes either formally or informally. Informal ritual engagements tend to be situations where people experience a spiritual presence/power while undertaking everyday acts. They may occur when a person comes into close contact with spiritually charged contexts (e.g. Dreaming sites) or when a person simply senses that a spirit has made its presence felt - it is difficult to be alone in a spiritscape. Formal ritual engagements involve people taking an active role in controlling spiritual forces through special codified performances. Following David, a formal 'ritual action is aimed at achieving an outcome that is beyond its own execution, a purpose beyond itself, although there is no guarantee that the effect will match the original anticipation' (2002: 50). This intended control (mostly transient) not only includes managing the resource productivity of the seas through 'increase' or 'maintenance' rituals (spiritual renewal), but also</page><page sequence="8">336 Ian J. McNiven managing winds, waves, tides, animal movements (hunting magic), etc. Ritual manage- ment and control of spiritscapes is central to what I call the ritual orchestration of seascapes (detailed in McNiven and Feldman 2003). These rituals of orchestration usually take place in marine contexts - either near the beach (immediate coastal strip or inter-tidal zone) or across the sea (isolated tidal reefs or on the water surface). Such rituals can include speeches, songs, dances, the recital of place or personal names in a rightful calling of the spirits, and may employ ritual paraphernalia and offerings; they usually take place at specially prepared sites. Thus, formal and informal rituals inscribe land- and seascapes with prescribed and situational liminal zones respectively where people experience the spiritual through bodily/sensual engagement (see Langton 2002). Open water Bradley (1998: 137-9) records that, among the Yanyuwa, the act of dugong hunting across the sea is a recreation of the Spirit Ancestor Dugong Hunters and a 'phenomenological rendering' and reaffirmation of Yanyuwa identity as 'dugong hunters of excellence' and Saltwater People. In this sense, hunting initiates an informal ritual nexus between hunters and Dreaming beings. Formally choreographed rituals on the sea mostly take the form of spiritual renewal and propitiatory offerings. Rituals of spiritual renewal tend to involve returning sections of hunted marine animals back to the sea and are perhaps best described as 'increase' or 'maintenance' rites. Examples include turtle bones by Croker Island people of Arnhem Land and dugong heads by the Yanyuwa (Bradley 1991; Sharp 2002). In what may be the ultimate offering to the sea, 'some of the inhabitants of the smaller islands about Broad- sound' in central Queensland 'buried' their dead at sea (Roth 1898: 46, 1907: 398). Propitiatory offerings are mainly aimed at placating sea spirits to make seas safe for travel. In this connection, the most powerful spiritual essence for many Aboriginal groups is the Rainbow Serpent. It is found across the continent 'wherever there are bodies of water, particularly large bodies of water' (Peterson and Rigsby 1998b: 6). For Aboriginal people of the Gulf of Carpentaria, cyclones, waterspouts and rainbows are manifestations of the Rainbow Serpent (Memmott and Trigger 1998). In eastern Torres Strait, Meriam people will put food and even cigarettes into the sea near the remote Maizab Kaur (Bramble Cay) as gifts to Rebes (a local mythological/spirit being) to ensure safe travel (Lawrie 1970). The Kaurareg of southern Torres Strait 'placate the spirit' of a dangerous current by 'throwing' bread and a lit cigarette into the sea (Southon et al. 1998: 224). However, Croker Island people will not throw 'meat and fatty substances' overboard for fear that it will 'arouse' the Rainbow Serpent (Peterson and Rigsby 1998b: 6). Tidal flats Tidal flats are dynamic areas between the high and low tide marks. They either flank areas of land (mainland and islands) or are located out to sea (sandbanks, reefs). The high-water mark is particularly significant as it represents the meeting place of two major realms - the land and the sea. By definition, ritual sites within the inter-tidal zone are inundated at least once a day.</page><page sequence="9">Saltwater People 337 The best-known inter-tidal zone sites are stone-walled fishtraps. While archaeologists generally see these sites as secular fish procurement facilities, ethnographic observations indicate associative ritual performances. For example, on Erub Island in eastern Torres Strait, certain stone-walled tidal fishtraps (sai) included a special 'big stone' or a 'roughly carved stone' to which offerings were made to bring 'plenty of fish' (Haddon 1935: 197). On nearby Mer Island is a stone 'cairn' located in the inter-tidal zone that similarly functions to attract fish (Haddon 1908: 217). The Yawuru perform less tangible fishing (hunting) magic rituals with little or no archaeological expression. Senior men sing 'sacred verses' to 'pull' fish into natural 'rock pool fishtraps'. Other senior men attract fish by performing a 'secret ritual involving blood' and the singing of sacred verses (Sullivan 1998: 101). A rare site type found on tidal flats is arrangements of bone. Landtman (1927: 305) recorded that Kiwai Papuans from the north coast of Torres Strait knew of a sea spirit called 6boabi that killed and ate dugongs on Kimusu Reef, 25km out to sea. Dugong bones seen on this distant reef at low tide were believed to be the result of such meals and were subsequently 'arranged in circles'. 6bodbi can provide hunters with special medi- cines during dreams to assist with harpooning. This site is the only aquatic bone arrange- ment recorded to date in Australia. Some inter-tidal zone sites are associated with controlling the elements. On Mer in eastern Torres Strait, Haddon (1908: 201-2) recorded a rock hole associated with two (exotic) granite boulders that is 'covered by the sea at high tide'. Rituals performed at this zogo site were to make a 'big wind' from the southeast. Land The most commonly recorded ritual sites associated with orchestration of seascapes are on dry land. Bradley (1991: 102-4) documents a Dugong Dreaming 'increase' centre jointly controlled by Mara and Yanyuwa peoples. The site consists in part of a series of oval-shaped quartzite outcrops (each a few metres long) that are said to be a 'herd' of 'metamorphosed dugong [male and female] and a single dolphin which were stranded on dry land by a receding king tide (bambiliwa) during the Dreaming'. The ritual involves men striking one of the female dugongs with 'hammerstones' while the 'names of dugong hunting locations along the coast ... are called out'. Bradley notes that this site has an archaeological expression with 'deep grooves and depressions' in some of the dugongs revealing that the 'rites of increase are of some antiquity'. Across Torres Strait, Islanders constructed a range of ritual sites (some referred to as zogo sites) from shells, stones and bones to control marine animals and the elements. Controlling the elements included bringing on rain (e.g. for plant growth and drinking water) and wind (e.g. for canoe travel). Lawrie (1970: 245) recorded a stone monolith on Masig Island that was used for 'calling up' the wind. Small anthropomorphic stone figures (doiom) were used in 'rain-making' rituals on Mer (Haddon 1908: 194-5). Control of animals related mostly to hunting magic and focused on the two key sources of protein - dugongs and turtles (Haddon 1935: 355; Johannes and MacFarlane 1991; McNiven and Feldman 2003). For example, an anthropomorphic stone figure associated with a 'heap of stones and shells' near the shore on Waier in the eastern Strait was used in rituals to</page><page sequence="10">338 Ian J. McNiven attract turtles (Haddon 1908: 216). A turtle site on Mabuiag consisted of a large granite boulder (known as wiwai) and a series of natural granite columns located less than 100m from the beach (Haddon 1904: 334-5). The Yam-Tudu people of the central Strait had a similar wiwai stone (said to have been thrown up by a whale) surrounded by shells associated with turtle-hunting magic (Haddon 1904: 335). Ritual use of this stone included cleaning the surrounding ground and painting the stone and shells with red ochre. Turtle-hunting sites could also feature the skulls and carapace of previously hunted turtles (Haddon 1904: 330-3, 1935: 69). Some turtle-hunting magic sites included skulls of successful hunters whose spirit could be ritually propitiated to help with future hunting expeditions (Haddon 1935: 69). Dugong-hunting magic sites included carved stone dugongs and the construction of large and elaborate mounds of dugong bones (McNiven and Feldman 2003). Seascape archaeology and maritime ritual sites Ethnographic information on Australia's indigenous Saltwater Peoples reveals a wide range of ritual sites associated with spiritual engagement with the sea. Most rituals attempted some form of spiritual control over the elements and marine animals. Such is the pervasiveness of these ritual sites that I consider them to be one of the defining features of marine specialists and their seascapes. Significantly, except for rituals performed on the water surface, many ritual sites located on either tidal flats or on land have an archaeological expression in the form of modified features (i.e. arrangements of stones, bones and shells). As such, the potential for finding maritime ritual sites, particu- larly those associated with the ritual orchestration of seascapes, is considered high for areas featuring cultures with an intimate relationship with the sea. To date, McNiven and Feldman (2003) provide the only Australian study aimed explic- itly at understanding indigenous seascapes as spiritscapes using archaeological sites. The study focused on Torres Strait Islander ritual orchestration of seascapes and the use of bone mounds in hunting magic rituals. In this case, analysis was enhanced by a rich local ethnography and oral testimony. But what about situations where little or no historical information is available to aid interpretation of archaeological sites with apparent ritual associations? It is in this context that the analytical value of the seascapes as spiritscapes approach outlined in this paper comes into play. I illustrate this value using Aboriginal stone arrangements from the inter-tidal zone of central Queensland. Within existing Australian archaeological interpretative frameworks, the function(s) of these sites is enigmatic. Central Queensland marine stone arrangements The inter-tidal zones of various places along the tropical coast of central Queensland reveal stone arrangements with features inconsistent with those expected at fish-trapping facilities (Brayshaw 1990: 159-61; McNiven 1999a). These marine sites are made from small stones (usually less than 20cm in diameter) arranged into curvi-linear lines and range in area from less than 100m2 to large complexes covering thousands of square</page><page sequence="11">Saltwater People 339 metres. All of the sites are located on recent (late Holocene) marine sands and muds in quite backwater areas, usually open areas behind mangrove forests near the upper high-water mark. They are not terrestrial sites that have succumbed to sea erosion, as in the case of 'Seahenge' in England (Pryor 2001). While many of the sites incorporate funnel-, V- and U-shaped features characteristic of tidal fishtraps (see Barham 2000; Campbell 1982; Dix and Meagher 1976; Dortch 1999; Godwin 1988; and Robins et al. 1998 for examples of Australian indigenous fishtraps), these structures are unlikely to function simply as 'subsistence' facilities. First, many of the V- and U-shaped features are small in area and face the wrong direction to trap fish (i.e. apertures face the sea). Second, stones forming the sites are often spaced apart with no inter-linking walls as would be necessary to trap fish. Third, many of the stone features, such as circles, cairns and complex mazes, provide no technical aid to trapping fish. Fourth, the sites tend to be located near the high-water mark in areas inundated only episodically with shallow water during excep- tionally large tides - areas not conducive to fish capture (see Figs 2 and 3, and Plates 1 and 2). Neither historical information nor oral testimony is forthcoming concerning the function of these sites. However, in a rare reference to a marine stone arrangement beyond central Queensland, Martin (1988: 36) notes that the long parallel line feature with funnel ends at Point Lowly (South Australia) is ascribed a 'ceremonial' status by local Aboriginal people. Significantly, the same area has 'mythological significance' and is a place of ritual orchestration where Aboriginal people used to 'sing [ritually call up] sharks and dolphins to drive fish towards the people on the shoreline where they surrounded the fish and picked them up' (Martin 1988: 36). A ceremonial association for marine stone arrangements is consistent with the function of terrestrial stone arrangements that occur across much of Australia. Terrestrial sites reveal mostly linear, curvi-linear, circle/oval and mound (cairn) features. All researchers concur that, based on direct ethnographic information and analogy, terrestrial stone arrangements have 'symbolic'/'ceremonial' functions (e.g. Bartholomai and Breeden 1961; Black 1950; Cane 1980; Flood 1980; Gould 1969; MacKnight and Gray 1970; Palmer 1977; Rowlands and Rowlands 1966). Within this broader cultural context, and given morphological similarities between terrestrial and marine stone arrangements, it is apparent that marine stone arrangements of central Queensland also had ceremonial associations (see also Brayshaw 1990: 161). This view is consistent with ethnographically documented stones of ritual significance within inter-tidal zones across northern Australia. Furthermore, marine ritual sites are not unexpected as the central Queensland coast was home to some of the continent's most elaborate maritime hunter-gatherers (Barker 1996; Border 1999; Rowland 1996) and the only known location for sea burials. Within the spiritscape context of this paper, establishment of marine stone arrangements by central Queensland Aboriginal people marked a new level of intimate contact with the sea and a change in the way the sea was spiritually engaged. Further insights into the nature of this engagement are revealed by the location and form of the stone arrangements. The incorporation of funnelling features within the stone arrangements (as with fishtraps) reveals a desire to direct and control water flow across the sites, albeit only episodically during large high tides for many sites (Plate 2). I posit that these sites were engineered to engage with local tidal waters and tidal forces that were critical to local Aboriginal</page><page sequence="12">Shoalwater Bay Region STONE ARRANGEMENT Site 124 RECORDED 1997 0 5m 0 : oo0 sooe 0 #00 7"7 ? 7/ e-1 z zo Figure 2 Plan of Stone Arrangement Site 124 from the inter-tidal zone of Shoalwater Bay, central Queensland.

Tidal waters nourish the vast mangrove forests and mudflats of the region that were key sources of animal and plant foods. In addition, understanding tidal movements was essential for scheduling use of the sea, especially the 'hazardous and lengthy' canoe voyages to off-shore islands (Border 1985: 43; Rowland 1984: 28). The importance of such knowledge is underscored by the fact that central Queensland experi- ences some of the most dramatic and dangerous tidal ranges (up to 10m) and tidal currents (up to 6 knots) in Australia (Maxwell 1968). These characteristics imply a recognition and significance of water's fluidity to the meaningfulness of the sea in past ontologies. Obtaining more detailed archaeological insights into the past significance of central Queensland marine stone arrangements will depend on our ability to further position these sites chronologically and functionally. The first issue is technical and depends on our ability to date underlying sediments. Once a chronological framework is established, the sites can be contextualized in terms of other long-term regional changes in intensity of use of the sea, particularly subsistence (e.g. use of marine foods) and mobility patterns (e.g. use of islands). Of relevance here is the process of regionalization whereby newly established residential groups intensify use of local resources and inscribe their social identity into landscapes through place-marking strategies that include formal ritual sites (McNiven 1999b). The archaeological record of the central Queensland coast reveals similar long-term changes, with major increases in Aboriginal activity - midden use, establishment of new sites (including rock-art sites) and island use - in the last 3000 and particularly the last 1000 years (Barker 1996; Barker et al. 1997; Border 1999; Rowland 1996). A late Holocene date for marine stone arrangements would be consistent with tenets of the regionalization model. In terms of the conceptual framework developed in this paper, the significance of these new ritual sites can be extended to include a change in the construction and ritual orchestration of seascapes. This change introduced new formalized liminal zones for spiritual engagement with the sea (i.e. near the high-water mark where the land meets the sea) to control marine forces (specifically those associated with tidal regimes). Whether or not it will ever be possible to draw specific links between use of stone arrangements, particular tidal regimes and the scheduling of certain cultural activities (e.g. island visitation) remains to be seen. Conclusion The indigenous Saltwater Peoples of northern Australia provide rare and instructive insights into how specialized maritime hunter-gatherers construct seascapes. Marine specialists have deep spiritual connections to the sea. These connections, underwritten by Dreaming (among Aboriginal people) cosmologies and celebrated through rituals, cere- monies, songs, dances and art, are central to the construction and reaffirmation of a 'Saltwater' identity. Rituals associated with orchestration of seascapes are associated with four key issues: 1) maintaining the availability of important subsistence species (i.e. 'increase' or 'maintenance' rites); 2) procuring key subsistence species (i.e. hunting magic); 3) controlling elements important to use of the sea (e.g. wind, waves and tides); and 4) mediating with the spirits and with the spirits of the dead (e.g. mortuary rituals) as a constant negotiation between the living-scape and the death-scape. However, these four key dimensions of seascapes are not unique to an Australian context. They are fundamental to specialized maritime hunter-gatherers in a broad range of cultural</page><page sequence="17">Saltwater People 345 contexts, both past and present. It is the materiality of ritual sites that provides scope to investigate archaeologically people's spiritual connections with, and ontological construc- tions of, marine environments as seascapes. As rituals operate within the confines of an existing cosmological order, any change in the production and use of such sites marks an epistemological change in the way people come to know their world - how they engage with spiritscapes and construct seascapes. Critical to such historicizing of people's rela- tionships with the sea will be exploration in a broad range of cultural settings of long-term changes in marine subsistence specialization and symbolic references and the degree to which these changes correlate with the onset of new maritime ritual sites and construc- tions of seascapes.
