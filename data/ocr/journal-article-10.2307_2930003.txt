<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mary Ann Doane The Voice in the Cinema: The Articulation of Body and Space Synchronization The silent film is certainly understood, at least retrospectively and even (it is arguable) in its time, as incomplete, as lacking speech. The stylized gestures of the silent cinema, its heavy pantomime, have been defined as a form of compensation for that lack. Hugo Miinsterberg wrote, in 1916, "To the actor of the moving pictures ... the temptation offers itself to overcome the deficiency [the absence of "words and the modulation of the voice"] by a heightening of the gestures and of the facial play, with the result that the emotional expression becomes exaggerated."' The absent voice re-emerges in gestures and the contortions of the face-it is spread over the body of the actor. The uncanny effect of the silent film in the era of sound is in part linked to the separation, by means of intertitles, of an actor's speech from the image of his/her body. Consideration of sound in the cinema (in its most historically and institutionally privileged form-that of dialogue or the use of the voice) engenders a network of metaphors whose nodal point appears to be the body. One may readily respond that this is only "natural"- who can conceive of a voice without a body?2 However, the body reconstituted by the technology and practices of the cinema is a I Hugo Munsterberg, The Film: A Psychological Study (New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1970), p. 49. 2Two kinds of "voices without bodies" immediately suggest themselves-one theological the other scientific (two poles which, it might be added, are not ideologically unrelated): 1.) the voice of God incarnated in the Word 2.) the artificial voice of a computer. Neither seems to be capable of representation outside of a certain anthropomorphism, however. God is pictured, in fact, as having a quite specific body-that of a male patriarchal figure. Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica illustrate the tendencies toward anthropomorphism in the depiction of computers. In the latter, even a computer (named Cora) deprived of mobility and the simulacrum of a human form, is given a voice which is designed to evoke the image of a sensual female body. 33</page><page sequence="2">Yale French Studies fantasmatic body, which offers a support as well as a point of identification for the subject addressed by the film. The purpose of this essay is simply to trace some of the ways in which this fantasmatic body acts as a pivot for certain cinematic practices of representation and authorizes and sustains a limited number of relationships be- tween voice and image. The attributes of this fantasmatic body are first and foremost unity (through the emphasis on a coherence of the senses) and presence-to-itself. The addition of sound to the cinema introduces the possiblity of re-presenting a fuller (and organically unified) body, and of confirming the status of speech as an individual property right. The potential number and kinds of articulations between sound and image ar reduced by the very name attached to the new heterogeneous medium-the "talkie." Histories of the cinema ascribe the stress on synchronization to a "public demand": "the public, fascinated by the novelty, wanting to be sure they were hearing what they saw, would have felt that a trick was being played on them if they were not shown the words coming from the lips of the actors."3 In Lewis Jacobs' account, this fear on the part of the audience of being "cheated" is one of the factors which initially limits the deployment of sonorous material (as well as the mobility of the camera). From this perspec- tive, the use of voice-off or voice-over must be a late acquisition, attempted only after a certain "breaking-in" period during which the novelty of the sound film was allowed to wear itself out. But, whatever the fascination of the new medium (or whatever meaning is attached to it by retrospective readings of its prehistory), there is no doubt that synchronization (in the form of "lip-sync" has played a major role in the dominant narative cinema. Technology standardizes the relation through the development of the synchronizer, the Moviola, the flatbed editing table. The mixing apparatus allows a greater control over the establishment of relationships between dialogue, music, and sound effects and, in practice, the level of the dialogue generally determines the levels of sound effects and music.4 3Lewis, Jacobs, The Rise of the American Film: A Critical History (New York: Teachers College Press, 1968), p. 435. 4For a more detailed discussion of this hierarchy of sounds and of other relevant techniques in the construction of the sound-track see M. Doane, "Ideology and the 34</page><page sequence="3">Mary Ann Doane Despite a number of experiments with other types of sound/image relationships (those of Clair, Lang, Vigo and, more recently, Godard, Straub, and Duras), synchronous dialogue remains the dominant form of sonorous representation in the cinema. Yet, even when asynchronous or "wild" sound is utilized, the fantasmatic body's attribute of unity is not lost. It is simply displaced- the body in the film becomes the body of the film. Its senses work in tandem, for the combination of sound and image is described in terms of "totality" and the "organic."5 Sound carries with it the potential risk of exposing the material heterogeneity of the medium; attempts to contain that risk surface in the language of the ideology of organic unity. In the discourse of technicians, sound is "married" to the image and, as one sound engineer puts it in an article on post- synchronization, "one of the basic goals of the motion picture industry is to make the screen look alive in the eyes of the audience . . . ". 6 Concomitant with the demand for a life-like representation is the desire for "presence," a concept which is not specific to the cinematic soundtrack but which acts as a standard to measure quality in the sound recording industry as a whole. The term "presence" offers a certain legitimacy to the wish for pure reproduction and becomes a selling point in the construction of sound as a commodity. The television commercial asks whether we can "tell the difference" between the voice of Ella Fitzgerald and that of Memorex (and since our representative in the commercial-the ardent fan-cannot, the only conclusion to be drawn is that owning a Memorex tape is equivalent to having Ella in your living room).

According to Benjamin, [the] contemporary decay of the aura. . . rests on two circumstances, both of which are related to the increasing significance of the masses in contemporary life. Namely, the desire of contemporary masses to bring things 'closer' spatially and humanly, which is just as ardent as their bent toward overcoming the uniqueness of every reality by accepting its reproduction.8 Nevertheless, while the desire to bring things closer is certainly exploited in making sound marketable, the qualities of uniqueness and authenticity are not sacrificed-it is not any voice which the tape brings to the consumer but the voice of Ella Fitzgerald. The voice is not detachable from a body which is quite specific-that of the star. In the cinema, cult value and the "aura" resurface in the star system. In 1930 a writer feels the need to assure audiences that post- synchronization as a technique does not necessarily entail substituting an alien voice for a "real" voice, that the industry does not condone a mismatching of voices and bodies.9 Thus, the voice serves as a support for the spectator's recognition and his/her identification of, as well as with, the star. Just as the voice must be anchored by a given body, the body must be anchored in a given space. The fantasmatic visual space which the film constructs is supplemented by techniques designed to spatialize the voice, to localize it, give it depth and thus lend to the characters the consistency of the real. A concern for room tone, reverberation characteristics and sound perspective manifests a desire to re-create, as one sound editor describes it, "the bouquet that surrounds the 7Walter Benjamin, "The work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," in Illuminations, ed.

Failure to do so risks exposure of the fact that looping is "narration masking as dialogue."' Dialogue is defined therefore, not simply in terms of the establishment of an I-you relationship, but as the necessary spatializing of that relationship. Techniques of sound recording tend to confirm the cinema's function as a mise-en-scene of bodies. Voice-off and Voice-over The spatial dimension which monophonic sound is capable of simulating is that of depth-the apparent source of the sound may be moved forward or backward but the lateral dimension is lacking due to the fact that there is no sideways spread of reverberation or of ambient noise. 12 Nevertheless, sound/image relationships established in the narrative film work to suggest that sound does, indeed, issue from that other dimension. In film theory, this work to provide the effect of a lateral dimension receives recognition in the term "voice- off." "Voice-off" refers to instances in which we hear the voice of a character who is not visible within the frame. Yet the film establishes, by means of previous shots or other contextual determinants, the character's "presence" in the space of the scene, in the diegesis. He/she is "just over there," 'just beyond the frameline," in a space which "exists" but which the camera does not choose to show. The traditional use of voice-off constitutes a denial of the frame as a limit '0Walter Murch, "The Art of the Sound Editor: An Interview with Walter Murch," interview by Larry Sturhahn, Filmmaker's Newsletter, 8, no. 2 (December 1974), 23. X " Ibid. '2Stereo reduces this problem but does not solve it-the range of perspective effects is still limited. Much of the discussion which follows is based on the use of monophonic sound, but also has implications for stereo. In both mono and stereo, for instance, the location of the speakers is designed to insure that the audience hears sound "which is roughly coincident with the image." See AlecNisbett, The Technique of the Sound Studio (New York: Focal Press Limited, 1972), pp. 530, 532. 37</page><page sequence="6">Yale French Studies and an affirmation of the unity and homogeneity of the depicted space. Because it is defined in terms of what is visible within the rectangular space of the screen, the term "voice-off" has been subject to some dispute. Claude Bailble, for instance, argues that a voice-off must always be a "voice-in" because the literal source of the sound in the theater is always the speaker placed behind the screen. 13 Yet, the space to which the term refers is not that of the theater but the fictional space of the diegesis. Nevertheless, the use of the term is based on the requirement that the two spaces coincide, "overlap" to a certain extent. For the screen limits what can be seen of the diegesis (there is always "more" of the diegesis than the camera can cover at any one time). The placement of the speaker behind the screen simply confirms the fact that the cinematic apparatus is designed to promote the impression of a homogeneous space-the senses of the fantasmatic body cannot be split. The screen is the space where the image is deployed while the theater as a whole is the space of the deployment of sound. Yet, the screen is given precedence over the acoustical space of the theater-the screen is posited as the site of the spectacle's unfolding and all sounds must emanate from it. (Bailble asks, "What would be, in effect, a voice-off which came from the back of the theater? Poor little screen . . . "14 in other words, its effect would be precisely to diminish the epistemological power of the image, to reveal its limitations.) The hierarchical placement of the visible above the audible, according to Christian Metz, is not specific to the cinema but a more general cultural production. 15 And the term voice-off merely acts as a reconfirmation of that hierarchy. For it only appears to describe a sound-what it really refers to is the visibility (or lack of visibility) of the source of the sound. Metz argues that sound is never "off.' While a visual element specified as "off" actually lacks visibility, a "sound- off" is always audible. t3C. Bailbl, "Programmation de 1'6coute (2)," Cahiers du Cinema, 293 (Octobre 1978), 9. '4Ibid.

While it is true that sound is almost always discussed with reference to the image, it does not necessarily follow that this automatically makes sound subordinate. From another perspective, it is doubtful that any image (in the sound film) is uninflected by sound. This is crucially so, given the fact that in the dominant narrative cinema, sound extends from beginning to end of the, film- sound is never absent (silence is, at the least, room tone). In fact, the lack of any sound whatsoever is taboo in the editing of the soundtrack. The point is not that we "need" terms with which to describe, honor and acknowledge the autonomy of a particular sensory mater- ial, but that we must attempt to think the heterogeneity of the cinema. This might be done more fruitfully by means of the concept of space than through the unities of sound and image. In the cinematic situation, three types of space are put into play: 1.) The space of the diegesis. This space has no physical limits, it is not contained or measurable. It is a virtual space constructed by the film and is delineated as having both audible and visible traits (as well as implications that its objects can be touched, smelled, and tasted). 2.) The visible space of the screen as receptor of the image. It is measurable and "contains" the visible signifiers of the film. Strictly speaking, the screen is not audible although the placement of the speaker behind the screen constructs that illusion. 3.) The acoustical space of the theater or auditorium. It might be argued that this space is also visible, but the film cannot visually activate signifiers in this space unless a second projector is used. Again, despite the fact that the speaker is behind the screen and therefore sound appears to be emanating from a focused point, sound is not "framed" in the same way as the image. In a sense, it envelops the spectator. All of these are spaces for the spectator, but the first is the only space which the characters of the fiction film can acknowledge (for 39</page><page sequence="8">Yale French Studies the characters there are no voices-off). Different cinematic modes- documentary, narrative, avant-garde-establish different relationships between the three spaces. The classical narrative film, for instance, works to deny the existence of the last two spaces in order to buttress the credibility (legitimacy) of the first space. If a character looks at and speaks to the spectator, this constitutes an acknowledgment that the character is seen and heard in a radically different space and is therefore generally read as transgressive. Nothing unites the three spaces but the signifying practice of the film itself together with the institutionalization of the theater as a type of meta-space which binds together the three spaces, as the place where a unified cinematic discourse unfolds. The cinematic institution's stake in this process of unification is apparent. Instances of voice-off in the classical film are particularly interesting examples of the way in which the three spaces undergo an elaborate imbrication. For the phenomenon of the voice-off cannot be understood outside of a consideration of the relationships established between the diegesis, the visible space of the screen, and the acoustical space of the theater. The place in which the signifier manifests itself is the acoustical space of the theater, but this is the space with which it is least concerned. The voice-off deepens the diegesis, gives it an extent which exceeds that of the image, and thus supports the claim that there is a space in the fictional world which the camera does not register. In its own way, it accounts for lost space. The voice-off is a sound which is first and foremost in the service of the film's construction of space and only indirectly in the service of the image. It validates both what the screen reveals of the diegesis and what it conceals. Nevertheless, the use of the voice-off always entails a risk-that of exposing the material heterogeneity of the cinema. Synchronous sound masks the problem and this at least partially explains its dominance. But the more interesting question, perhaps, is: how can the classical film allow the representation of a voice whose source is not simultaneously represented? As soon as the sound is detached from its source, no longer anchored by a represented body, its potential work as a signifier is revealed. There is always something uncanny about a voice which emanates from a source outside the frame. However, as 40</page><page sequence="9">Mary Ann Doane Pascal Bonitzer points out, the narrative film exploits the marginal anxiety connected with the voice-off by incorporating its disturbing effects within the dramatic framework. Thus, the function of the voice- off (as well as that of the voice-over) becomes extremely important in film noir. Bonitzer takes as his example Kiss Me Deadly, a film noir in which the villain remains out of frame until the last sequences of the film. Maintaining him outside of the field of vision "gives to his sententious voice, swollen by mythological comparisons, a greater power of disturbing, the scope of an oracle-dark prophet of the end of the world. And, in spite of that, his voice is submitted to the destiny of the body . .. a shot, he falls-and with him in ridicule, his discourse with its prophetic accents."'16 The voice-off is always "submitted to the destiny of the body" because it belongs to a character who is confined to the space of the diegesis, if not to the visible space of the screen. Its efficacity rests on the knowledge that the character can easily be made visible by a slight refraining which would re-unite the voice and its source. The body acts as an invisible support for the use of both the voice-over during a flashback and the interior monologue as well. Although the voice- over in a flashback effects a temporal dislocation of the voice with respect to the body, the voice is frequently returned to the body as a form of narrative closure. Furthermore, the voice-over very often simply initiates the story and is subsequently superseded by synchro- nous dialogue, allowing the diegesis to "speak for itself." In Sunset Boulevard the convention is taken to its limits: the voice-over narration is, indeed, linked to a body (that of the hero), but it is the body of a dead man. In the interior monologue, on the other hand, the voice and the body are represented simultaneously, but the voice, far from being an extension of that body, manifests its inner lining. The voice displays what is inaccessible to the image, what exceeds the visible: the "inner life" of the character. The voice here is the privileged mark of interiority, turning the body "inside-out." 16Pascal Bonitzer, "Les silences de la voix," Cahiers du Cinema, 256 (FRvrier-Mars 1975), 25. My translation. 41</page><page sequence="10">Yale French Studies The voice-over commentary in the documentary, unlike the voice- off, the voice-over during a flashback, or the interior monologue, is, in effect, a disembodied voice. While the latter three voices work to affirm the homogeneity and dominance of diegetic space, the voice-over commentary is necessarily presented as outside of that space. It is its radical otherness with respect to the diegesis which endows this voice with a certain authority. As a form of direct address, it speaks without mediation to the audience, by-passing the "characters" and establish- ing a complicity between itself and the spectator-together they understand and thus place the image. It is precisely because the voice is not localizable, because it cannot be yoked to a body, that it is capable of interpreting the image, producing its truth. Disembodied, lacking any specification in space or time, the voice-over is, as Bonitzer points out, beyond criticism-it censors the questions "Who is speaking?," "Where?," "In what time?," and "For whom?." This is not, one suspects, without ideological implications. The first of these implications is that the voice-off'7 represents a power, that of disposing of the image and of what it reflects, from a space absolutely other with respect to that inscribed in the image-track. Absolutely other and absolutely indeterminant. Because it rises from the field of the Other, the voice-off is assumed to know: this is the essence of its power.... The power of the voice is a stolen power, a usurpation. 8 In the history of the documentary, this voice has been for the most part that of the male, and its power resides in the possession of knowledge and in the privileged, unquestioned activity of interpretation. This function of the voice-over has been appropriated by the television documentary and television news programs, in which sound carries the burden of "information" while the impoverished image simply fills the screen. Even when the major voice is explicitly linked with a body (that of the anchorman in television news), this body, in its turn, is situated in the non-space of the studio. In film, on the other hand, the voice- over is quite often dissociated from any specific figure. The guarantee '7Bonitzer uses the term "voice-off" in a general sense which includes both voice- off and voice-over, but here he is referring specifically to voice-over commentary. '8Bonitzer, p. 26. My translation. 42</page><page sequence="11">Mary Ann Doane of knowledge, in such a system, lies in its irreducibility to the spatio- temporal limitations of the body. The Pleasure of Hearing The means by which sound is deployed in the cinema inplicate the spectator in a particular textual problematic-they establish certain conditions for understanding which obtain in the "intersubjective relation" between film and spectator. The voice-over commentary and, differently, the interior monologue and voice-over-flashback speak more or less directly to the spectator, constituting him/her as an empty space to be "filled" with knowledge about events, character psychology, etc. More frequently, in the fiction film, the use of synchronous dialogue and the voice-off presuppose a spectator who overhears and, overhearing, is unheard and unseen himself. This activity with respect to the soundtrack is not unlike the voyeurism often exploited by the cinematic image. In any event, the use of the voice in the cinema appeals to the spectator's desire to hear, or what Lacan refers to as the invocatory drive. In what does the pleasure of hearing consist? Beyond the added effect of "realism" which sound gives to the cinema, beyond its supplement of meaning anchored by intelligible dialogue, what is the specificity of the pleasure of hearing a voice with its elements escaping a strictly verbal codification-volume, rhythm, timbre, pitch? Psychoanalysis situates pleasure in the divergence between the present experience and the memory of satisfaction: "Between a (more or less inaccessible) memory and a very precise (and localizable) immediacy of perception is opened the gap where pleasure is produced." '9 Memories of the first experiences of the voice, of the hallucinatory satisfaction it offered, circumscribe the pleasure of hearing and ground its relation to the fantasmatic body. This is not simply to situate the experiences of infancy as the sole determinant in a system directly linking cause and effect but to acknowledge that the traces of archaic desires are never annihilated. According to Guy Rosolato, it is "the organization of the 19Serge Leclaire, Dimasquer le reel, p. 64, quoted in C. Bailbl, "Programmation de l'6coute (3)," Cahiers du Cinema, 297 (Fevrier 1979), 46.

"(p. 80) The first differences are traced along the axis of sound: the voice of the mother, the voice of the father. Furthermore, the voice has a greater command over space than the look-one can hear around corners, through walls. Thus, for the child the voice, even before language, is the instrument of demand. In the construction/hallucination of space and the body's relation to that space, the voice plays a major role. In comparison with sight, as Rosolato points out, the voice is reversible: sound is simultaneously emitted and heard, by the subject himself. As opposed to the situation in seeing, it is as if "an 'acoustical' mirror were always in function. Thus, the images of entry and exit relative to the body are intimately articulated. They can therefore be confounded, inverted, favored one over the other." (p. 79) Because one can hear sounds behind oneself as well as those with sources inside the body (sounds of digestion, circulation, respiration, etc.), two sets of terms are placed in opposition: exterior/front/sight and interior/back/hearing. And "hallucinations are determined by an imaginary structuration of the body according to these oppositions... ." (p. 80) The voice appears to lend itself to hallucination, in particular the hallucination of power over space effected by an extension or restructuration of the body. Thus, as Lacan points out, our mass media and our technology, as mechanical extensions of the body, result in "planeterizing" or "even stratospherizing" the voice.2' The voice also traces the forms of unity and separation between bodies. The mother's soothing voice, in a particular cultural context, is a major component of the "sonorous envelope" which surrounds the child and is the first model of auditory pleasure. An image of corporeal 20Guy Rosolato, "La voix: entre corps et langage," Revue francaise de psychanalyse, 38 (Janvier 1974), 83. My translation.

Alan Sheridan (London: The Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-Analysis, 1977), p. 274. 44</page><page sequence="13">Mary Ann Doane unity is derived from the realization that the production of sound by the voice and its audition coincide. The imaginary fusion of the child with the mother is supported by the recognition of common traits characterizing the different voices and, more particularly, of their potential for harmony. According to Rosolato, the voice in music makes appeal to the nostalgia for such an imaginary cohesion, for a "veritable incantation" of bodies. The harmonic and polyphonic unfolding in music can be understood as a succession of tensions and releases, of unifications and divergences between parts which are gradually stacked, opposed in successive chords only to be resolved ultimately into their simplest unity. It is therefore the entire dramatization of separated bodies and their reunion which harmony supports. (p. 82) Yet, the imaginary unity associated with the earliest experience of the voice is broken by the premonition of difference, division, effected by the intervention of the father whose voice, engaging the desire of the mother, acts as the agent of separation and constitutes the voice of the mother as the irretrievably lost object of desire. The voice in this instance, far from being the narcissistic measure of harmony, is the voice of interdiction. The voice thus understood is an interface of imaginary and symbolic, pulling at once toward the signifying organiza- tion of language and its reduction of the range of vocal sounds to those it binds and codifies, and toward original and imaginary attachments, "representable in the fantasm by the body, or by the corporeal mother, the child at her breast" (p. 86). At the cinema, the sonorous envelope provided by the theatrical space together with techniques employed in the construction of the soundtrack work to sustain the narcissistic pleasure derived from the image of a certain unity, cohesion and, hence, an identity grounded by the spectator's fantasmatic relation to his/her own body. The aural illusion of position constructed by the approximation of sound perspective and by techniques which spatialize the voice and endow it with "presence" guarantees the singularity and stability of a point of audition, thus holding at bay the potential trauma of dispersal, dismemberment, difference. The subordination of the voice to the screen as the site of the spectacle's unfolding makes vision and hearing work together in manufacturing the "hallucination" of a fully sensory 45</page><page sequence="14">Yale French Studies world. Nevertheless, the recorded voice, which presupposes a certain depth, is in contradiction with the flatness of the two-dimensional image. Eisler and Adorno note that the spectator is always aware of this divergence, of the inevitable gap between the represented body and its voice. And for Eisler and Adorno this partially explains the function of film music: first used in the exhibition of silent films to conceal the noise of the projector (to hide from the spectator the "uncanny" fact that his/her pleasure is mediated by a machine), music in the "talkie" takes on the task of closing the gap between voice and body. 22 If this imaginary harmony is to be maintained, however, the potential aggressivity of the voice (as the intrumnent of interdiction and the material support of the symptom-hearing voices-in paranoia) must be attenuated. The formal perfection of sound recording in the cinema consists in reducing not only the noise of the apparatus but any "grating" noise which is not "pleasing to the ear." On another level, the aggressivity of the filmic voice can be linked to the fact that sound is directed at the spectator-necessitating, in the fiction film, its deflec- tion through dialogue (which the spectator is given only obliquely, to overhear) and, in the documentary, its mediation by the content of the image. In the documentary, however, the voice-over has come to represent an authority and an aggressivity which can no longer be sustained-thus, as Bonitzer points out, the proliferation of new docmentaries which reject the absolute of the voice-over and, instead, claim to establish a democratic system, "letting the event speak for itself." Yet, what this type of film actually promotes is the illusion that reality speaks and is not spoken, that the film is not a constructed discourse. In effecting an "impression of knowledge", a knowledge which is given and not produced, the film conceals its own work and posits itself as a voice without a subject.23 The voice is even more powerful in silence. The solution, then, is not to banish the voice but to construct another politics. 22Hanns Eisler, Composing for the Films (New York: Oxford University Press, 1947), pp. 75-77. 23Bonitzer, pp. 23-4. 46</page><page sequence="15">Mary Ann Doane The Politics of the Voice The cinema presents a spectacle composed of disparate elements- images, voices, sound effects, music, writing-which the mise-en- scene, in its broadest sense, organizes and aims at the body of the spectator, sensory receptacle of the various stimuli. This is why Lyotard refers to classical mise-en-scene (in both the theater and the cinema) as a kind of somatography, or inscription on the body: . . .the mise-en-scene turns written signifiers into speech, song, and movements executed by bodies capable of moving, singing speaking; and this transcription is intended for other living bodies-the spectators-capable of being moved by these songs, movements, and words. It is this transcribing on and for bodies, considered as multi-sensory potentialities, which is the work characteristic of the mise-en-scene. Its elementary unity is polyesthetic like the human body: capacity to see, to hear, to touch, to move. . .. The idea of performance ... even if it remains vague, seems linked to the idea of inscription on the body.24 Classical mise-en-scene has a stake in perpetuating the image of unity and identity sustained by this body and in staving off the fear of fragmentation. The different sensory elements work in collusion and this work denies the material heterogeneity of the "body" of the film. All of the signifying strategies for the deployment of the voice discussed earlier are linked with such homogenizing effects: synchro- nization binds the voice to a body in a unity whose immediacy can only be perceived as a given; the voice-off holds the spectacle to a space- extended but still coherent; and the voice-over commentary places the image by endowing it with a clear intelligibility. In all of this, what must be guarded is a certain "oneness." This "oneness" is the mark of a mastery and a control and manifests itself most explicitly in the tendency to confine the voice-over commentary in the documentary to a single voice. For, according to Bonitzer, "when one divides that voice or, what amounts to the same thing, multiplies it, the system and its effects change.

"25 This entails not only or not merely increasing the number of voices but radically changing their relationship to the image, effecting a disjunc- tion between sound and meaning, emphasizing what Barthes refers to as the "grain" of the voice26 over and against its expressivity or power of representation. In the contemporary cinema, the names which imme- diately come to mind are those of Godard (who, even in an early film such as Vivre Sa Vie which relies heavily upon synchronous sound, resists the homogenizing effects of the traditional use of voice-off by means of a resolute avoidance of the shot/reverse-shot structure-the camera quickly panning to keep the person talking in frame) and Straub (for whom the voice and sound in general become the marks of a non-progressive duration). The image of the body thus obtained is not one of imaginary cohesion but of dispersal, division, fragmen- tation. Lyotard speaks of the "post-modernist" text which escapes the closure of representation by creating its own addressee, "a disconcer- ted body, invited to stretch its sensory capacities beyond measure. "27 Such an approach, which takes off from a different image of the body, can be understood as an attempt to forge a politics based on an erotics. Bonitzer uses the two terms interchangeably, claiming that the scission of the voice can contribute to the definition of "another politics (or erotics) of the voice-off."28 The problem is whether such an erotics, bound to the image of an extended or fragmented body and strongly linked with a particular signifying material, can found a political theory or practice. There are three major difficulties with the notion of a political erotics of the voice. The first is that, relying as it does on the idea of expanding the range or re-defining the power of the senses, and opposing itself to meaning, a political erotics is easily recuperable as a form of romanticism or as a mysticism which effectively skirts problems of epistemology, lodging itself firmly in a mind/body dualism. Secondly, the overemphasis upon the isolated effectivity of a 15 Bonitzer, p. 31. 26See Roland Barthes, "The Grain of the Voice," in Image-Music-Text, trans.

As Paul Willemen points out, a concentration upon the specificities of the various "technico-sensorial unities" of the cinema often precludes a recognition that the material- ity of the signifier is a "second order factor" (with respect to language understood broadly as symbolic system) and tends to reduce a complex heterogeneity to a mere combination of different materials.29 Yet, a film is not a simple juxtaposition of sensory elements but a discourse, an enunciation. This is not to imply that the isolation and investigation of a single signifying material such as the voice is a fruitless endeavor but that the establishment of a direct connection between the voice and politics is fraught with difficulties. Thirdly, the notion of a political erotics of the voice is particularly problematic from a feminist perspective. Over and against the theorization of the look as phallic, as the support of voyeurism and fetishism (a drive and a defense which, in Freud, are linked explicitly with the male),30 the voice appears to lend itself readily as an alternative to the image, as a potentially viable means whereby the woman can "make herself heard." Luce Irigaray, for instance, claims that patriarchal culture has a heavier investment in seeing than in hearing.31 Bonitzer, in the context of defining a political erotics, speaks of "returning the voice to women" as a major component. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that, while psychoanalysis delineates a pre-oedipal scenario in which the voice of the mother dominates, the voice, in psychoanalysis, is also the instrument of interdiction, of the patriarchal order. And to mark the voice as an isolated haven within patriarchy, or as having an essential relation to the woman, is to invoke the spectre of feminine specificity, always recuperable as another form of "otherness." A political erotics which posits a new fantasmatic, which relies on images of an "extended" 29Paul Willemen, "Cinema Thoughts," paper delivered at Milwaukee Conference on Cinema and Language, March 1979, pp. 12 and 3. 30See Laura Mulvey, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," Screen, 16 (Autumn 1975), 6-18 and Stephen Heath, "Sexual Difference and Representation," Screen, 19 (Autumn 1978), 51-112. 31For a fuller discussion of the relationship some feminists establish between the voice and the woman see Heath, "Sexual Difference," 83-84. 49</page><page sequence="18">Yale French Studies sensory body, is inevitably caught in the double bind which feminism always seems to confront: on the one hand, there is a danger in grounding a politics on a conceptualization of the body because the body has always been the site of woman's oppression, posited as the final and undeniable guarantee of a difference and a lack; but, on the other hand, there is a potential gain as well-it is precisely because the body has been a major site of oppression that perhaps it must be the site of the battle to be waged. The supreme achievement of patriarchal ideology is that it has no outside. In light of the three difficulties outlined above, however, it would seem unwise to base any politics of the voice solely on an erotics. The value of thinking the deployment of the voice in the cinema by means of its relation to the body (that of the character, that of the spectator) lies in an understanding of the cinema, from the perspective of a topology, as a series of spaces including that of the spectator-spaces which are often hierarchized or masked, one by the other, in the service of a representational illusion. Nevertheless, whatever the arrangement or interpenetration of the various spaces, they constitute a place where signification intrudes. The various techniques and strategies for the deployment of the voice contribute heavily to the definition of the form that "place" takes. 50</page></plain_text>
