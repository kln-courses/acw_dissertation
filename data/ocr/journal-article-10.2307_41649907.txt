CROWELL Heracles in the East: The Diffusion and Transformation of His Image in the Arts of Central Asia, India, and Medieval China The terranean question world of contacts of Greek and and cultural Roman influences times and between Han-Tang the China Medi- terranean world of Greek and Roman times and Han-Tang China has long piqued the curiosity of people from both West and East. The idea that major empires could have existed contemporaneously at op- posite ends of the Eurasian continent without affecting one another has seemed, especially to Westerners, an unlikely proposition.1 Trade con- tacts have long been assumed, though there has been some disagreement over whether there was any direct contact or whether the trade was conducted entirely through intermediaries in Central Asia and India. Likewise, artistic influences, especially from Greece, that appeared in Gandharan Buddhist art and made their way to China with the spread of Buddhism have been widely studied. The scope of the present study is more limited. Its purpose is to examine the migration and transformation of particular iconic elements associated with the Greek mythological figure Heracles as they trav- eled from the Mediterranean region eastward through Afghanistan and A previous version of this paper appeared in Chinese as "Helakelisi zai dongfang: qi xingxiang zai gudai Zhongya, Yindu yu Zhongguo zaoxing yishu zhong de liubo yu bianxing" ÉfrííjnL in R0ng Xinjiang ттк and Li Xiaozong eds., ZJiongwai quanxi shi, xin shiliao yu xin wenti (Beijing: Kexue chubanshe, 2004), pp. 15-47.

In Greek and Roman mythology, Heracles is a heroic figure with clearly defined form and attributes. In order to become an immortal god, he relied on the superhuman strength and intelligence of a demi- god. He helped mankind in times of disaster and performed the famous "Twelve Labors." In Greek and Roman art he has a well-defined and characteristic form. Because the characteristics are so well defined, we are able to trace the diffusion and transformation of his image with some confidence. In the process of diffusion, the identifying charac- teristics might be retained or they might be transformed, added to, or lost. Within a different cultural matrix the defining characteristics might be assumed, in toto or in part, by a "human" or "god" with a different role such that ultimately the original role of the "owner of the image" might be lost as an entirely different role appears. Because the story of Heracles is so well known and studies on it are numerous,2 I shall omit points that may be familiar to the reader and treat in detail the less fa- miliar. While I briefly touch on Heracles' original form in the Greek and Roman worlds and its diffusion into India and Central Asia, the focus will be on its transformation and reappearance in China. The immediate catalyst for this study was a three-colored Tang dynasty figurine of a warrior displayed at the Shaanxi Museum of His- tory.3 The figure is dressed in the armor typical of Tang pottery war- riors (figure i). A unique feature, however, is the helmet made from a tiger's or lion's pelt. The animal's ears, eyes, and nose are clearly visible on the helmet, and fangs protrude from the bottom edge on ei- ther side of the warrior's head. The pelt extends down the back of the figurine, and its paws are crossed beneath the warrior's chin. This sort of helmet is found in the depictions of some Buddhist guardian figures as well. Some have asserted that the tiger skin found on such figures has its origins in the attire of Tufan tL# warriors, who were a powerful Orient: Researches into Their Ancient and.

Most important of these is the club made from the branch of an olive tree, which sometimes remains or is sometimes transformed into a sword or even a vajra.

A possible indigenous association might be the "tiger brave" ( huben fËW) warriors often men- tioned in ancient Chinese works. But the ancient texts and commentaries suggest that "tiger brave" refers to the soldiers' bravery and is unrelated to their dress. Numerous representations of warriors are found on bronzes, pottery, stone and murals, but none has been shown wear- ing a lion or tiger helmet. During the Han there were "tiger braves" attired in clothing with tiger stripes, but they wear a "pheasant hat" decorated with a pheasant tail feather. Military hats decorated with such tail feathers continued in use down into the Sui and Tang periods.

This examination leads to the conclusion that these characteristic forms and transformed imagery were without doubt transmitted to China in the wake of Bud- dhism and that the "great beast pelt" ( da chong pi indicating the tiger pelt of the Tufan warriors) quite possibly also has its origins in the image of Vajrapani and the devas of Buddhism and thus also has an indirect connection with Heracles and Greece. HERACLES IN THE GREEK AND ROMAN WORLD The tale of Heracles was disseminated extensively throughout the Greek world and existed in many versions. According to the most com- mon version, the first labor that Heracles performed was to fight a lion whose skin could not be pierced by knife or spear. After he succeeded in killing the lion, he skinned it and draped himself with the pelt, the head thus becoming his helmet.6 He carried several weapons received from the gods, the best known of which was a club fashioned from olive wood. Starting from about the middle of the sixth century вс, the club and pelt became part of the defining features of Heracles, appearing on thousands of Greek and Roman vases, murals, coins, bronzes, stone sculptures and ornaments.7 These features have several points worth noting (see figures 2 and 3): 1 . usually depicted nude, very muscular, and bearded, though some ex- amples depict him dressed, clean shaven, or attired in armor (figure 4); 2 . pelt typically complete with not only the head attached but also the paws and even the tail. In some cases Heracles is wearing the pelt; tianwang tuxiang ji qi Xifang laiyuan" paper presented to the International Academic Conference on the Art of the Maijishan Grottoes and the Bud- dhist Culture of the Silk Road (July 2002), pp. 10-14. Japanese scholars such as Kurita Isao have already pointed to the connection between the guardian figures in Gandharan art and the figure of Heracles. See Kurita's Gandara bijutsu II: Butsuda no sekai iíyS^-уЩ ШН, (Tokyo: Nigensha, 1990), pp. 298-301. Also, Tokyo kokuritsu hakubutsukan Shiruku rodo dai bijutsu ten ì/ìVJu - (Tokyo, 1996), pll. 173, 181, points out the influence of the image of Heracles on the lion-skin headgear. Numerous Japanese scholars have pointed out the link between Greek and Gandharan art. The work by Kurita Isao just cited and Tanabe Katsumi Bishamonten õzõ no tanjõ (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Hiroshi bunkan, 1999) are representative. 6 The story exists in many different versions. See C.

Sometimes he is seen wearing only the pelt without the head, and sometimes he wears only the head as a helmet; 3. the olive-wood club's handle is thin and the end is thick; the surface studded with the stubs of limbs that have been trimmed away; 4. in the Roman period the figures for the most part modeled on Greek works. Heracles in some cases rests the club on shoulder and in oth- ers, the club is stood on the large end and inclined slightly with his hand resting on the top. The Roman club does not differ from the Greek version (figure 5). In the first and second centuries the lion's- head helmet became the formal attire of standard bearers ( aquili - fer) of the Roman legions, whose armor was the same as the normal legionnaire's, but using Heracles' lion's-head helmet, with legs at- tached to the pelt and crossed on the chest (figure 6). 8 5. Though the most important of Heracles' marks, the lion's pelt and club do not always occur together. Because they may be paired with certain other figures and situations, just one of the marks is sufficient to distinguish Heracles. 6. Heracles has these distinctive poses: seated, standing with hand raised adjusting headgear; one hand resting at an angle on club. Even a pose in a fragment can allow specialists to determine a fig- ure's role and even the period.9 ALEXANDER THE GREAT, ROMAN EMPERORS, AND THE DIFFUSION OF THE IMAGE With the campaign of Alexander the Great (356-323 вс) in the fourth century вс and the expansion of the Roman empire in the first century вс, the myths of Heracles and other Greek gods spread through- out Central Asia and eastward.10 The history of the figure of Heracles in the eastern Eurasian continent over the following 1000 years shows transformations of the form and the emergence of a mythology. Diffusion eastward from the Mediterranean of the stories and personae of Heracles and other figures of Greek mythology did not begin with Alexander, but can be traced at least to the Persian Wars of 8 See the image at http://cheiron.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~trajan/buildtrajanpage. cgi?452. 9 Examples are numerous.

In Hall 38 they discovered a fragment of a stone carving just under 7 cm in height and 4 cm in width. Although the head was missing, a hand, a leg and half the torso remained. From the remaining fragment, one can discern a nude body with a lion's paw draped across the chest be- low the neck. Something is also draped on the back of the left shoulder (figure 7). 12 Although the piece is fragmentary and physical aspects un- certain, if this is indeed a carving of Heracles, his appearance in Persia antedates Alexander by one or two centuries. It is of course undeniable that Alexander's expeditions, his estab- lishing cities of Alexandria all over the East, and moreover, his active fostering of a melding of Greek with Eastern peoples and cultures were the impetus for the rapid and ex- tensive dissemination of Greek culture.13 Following the collapse of the Alexandrian Empire came the Hellenistic period, during which regional commanders di- vided and held the empire for more than a century. Elements of Greek culture became deeply implanted in the soil of Central Asia and India and were sub- sequently disseminated to the neighboring regions of China and elsewhere. The relationship between the hero-god Heracles and Al- exander is especially close. Alex- ander and his kin firmly believed 11 Boardman, Diffusion of Classical Art , pp. 21-48.

What is impor- tant is that according to Alexander's most important biographer Arrian (ca. 95-175 ad), throughout his life Alexander aspired to emulate and even surpass his ancestors.14 According to the legends of the Greeks, Heracles had not only accomplished the so-called Twelve Labors; he also used his incomparable strength to conquer numerous places and monsters, ridding mankind of disasters. Achilles, the main protagonist and hero in Homer's epic, led the Greeks in attacking Troy. Arrian and modern Alexandrian scholars as well have recognized this sort of desire to emulate or surpass his ancestors as a significant motivation behind Alexander's achievements. The great German Alexandrian scholar Ul- rich Wilcken described the relationship between Alexander and these two figures of Greek mythology: Two of the heroes [Aristotle] mentions actually lighted Alexander on his path of conquest, Heracles and Achilles, whom Alexander revered as his ancestors: on his father's side he was a descendant of Heracles, and on his mother's side an Aeacid, sprung from Achil- les. If in Alexander's later years Heracles became more promi- nent, in his earlier days Alexander was inspired by the pattern of the youthful hero Achilles. This deeply-rooted and vivid con- ception of his personal affinity with these heroes is one of those non-rational and instinctive motives, without which we cannot understand him.15 While on eastern campaigns, Alexander would often plan an ac- tion just because Heracles had done it, even attempting feats at which Heracles had failed. For example, according to the account of the his- torian Callisthenes, when Alexander campaigned in Egypt, he made a special trip to see the oracle at Ammon. His reason for doing so was that according to tradition, Heracles and Perseus (a Homeric hero) had sought out such oracles.16 When Alexander reached India, he de- termined to conquer Ora, a place that, according to legend, Heracles had failed to subdue. Later, he used the example of his easy conquest of Ora to urge on his generals, who were unwilling to continue the eastern campaign.17 14 Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander, trans.

On a silver coin that Alexander minted in Syria in 325 вс, on one side there is a Figure 8.

Upon examina- tion, it was determined that the bas-relief on one side is a depiction of Alexander attacking the Persian Army at Issus (fig- ure 9). It shows a mounted Alexander 18 Scholars have determined that it was Alexander's court artist Lysippos who depicted Al- exander as Heracles. The sculpture done by Lysippos later became an important model for subsequent statues of Heracles. See J. P.

Some emulated Alexander's accomplishments and planned campaigns to India - for example, Marcus Antonius, Julius Caesar, and Traianus (r. 78-117 ad). Traianus defeated Parthia and took its capital. He ex- tended the empire's dominion eastward to Mesopotamia and is reputed to have said, "I should certainly have crossed the Indus, if I were still young."22 He regretted deeply that he was unable to reach the Indus as Alexander had done. But on the records of his battles found on the Column of Trajan one can see how the legionnaire standard-bearers of the time were modeled on both Heracles and Alexander and wore lion- skin helmets.23 The first emperor of Rome, Augustus, had the image of Alexander inlaid on his signet ring.24 Then there were emperors, such as Commodus (r. 177-192), who imitated Alexander in dressing up as Heracles. A marble statue of Com- modus dating from 1 91-192 was unearthed on the Möns Equilinus in Rome. On his head he is wearing lion-skin headgear; in one hand he holds a club, while in the other he has three golden apples, emulating the last of Heracles' Twelve La- bors (figure io).25 The third-cen- tury emperor Severus Alexander (r. 222-235 ad) changed his name 22 Cassius Dio Coccianus, Dio 's Roman History , The Loeb Classical Library (New York: G.

There are many indications of the reverence accorded him that existed in the eastern empire, and further east - to Western and Central Asia. HERACLES IN CENTRAL ASIA AND INDIA From Greece eastward to Bactria, countless kingdoms in northern Greece, Kushan, Bactria and Scythia were influenced by the represen- tations of Alexander as Heracles through the dissemination fostered by the Romans from the third century вс to the second or third century ad. Some rulers copied Alexander in dressing themselves up as Hera- cles, while others put the image of Heracles with lion skin and club on their coinage.27 Numerous bronze sculptures, stone reliefs, and coins containing the image of Heracles have been found in these regions. Only a small portion of extant examples can be adduced in this essay (see appendix, tables 1-3, and figures 11-19). Heracles of course was not the only figure of Greek mythology popular in this region. Apollo, Zeus, Dionysius, Poseidon, and others are found in abundance. By the second century вс, as Rome extended its dominion over the Mediterranean, many of these gods took on a Roman coloration, and belief in the transformed Greco-Roman gods then spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean and beyond. As the gods diffused into Central Asia and India, some retained their original elements, and others fused with local gods, resulting in further changes of form. I present several examples in what follows. Item 6 in table 2 was excavated in Begram, Afghanistan, and is a typical bronze statue of the Roman god Serapis-Heracles.28 Serapis was originally an Egyptian god of the Ptolemaic period and was related to Osiris, god of the underworld, and Apis the Bull. Ptolemy I is said to have wanted to create an Egyptian god acceptable to both Egyptians and Greeks, so he matched Osiris and Apis to produce a god named Sera- pls. Serapis corresponded to the Greek god Hades and was connected with Zeus and the god of medicine Aesculepius. He was responsible for health and mortality, and originally worship was limited to Egypt and 26 See Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Severus Alexander, v. 1-5, xin.1-5, xxv.9, xxx.3, XXXI. 5, XXXV. 1,4, XXXIX.

In the first and second centuries, however, he was favored by the Roman emperors and flourished wherever the power of Rome reached, especially in the eastern half of the empire. The figure of Serapis-Heracles excavated at Begram is shown enthroned with the modius , which is a basket /grain-measure on his head, a Greek symbol for the land of the dead, and holds the club of Heracles, testament to the amalgamation of the gods by the statue's maker. The basis for the amalgamation may have been that the Twelve Labors of Heracles in- cluded his journey into the underworld to bring back Cerberus, the dog that guarded the gates of the underworld for Hades (figure 20). This act established a connection between Heracles and Serapls. The inter- mingling of the roles and abilities of the gods was extremely common among the religious faiths of the ancient Mediterranean. The muscular figure of the demigod Heracles who relied on super- human strength to assist mankind to eliminate disasters also appeared in Central Asia. Alexander's glorification of himself, which was imi- tated by his descendants in action and in image, influenced later rulers in Central Asia, some of whom glorified themselves as descendants of Alexander by having themselves depicted as Heracles. An example of this is Antiochus I (69-34 BC)&gt; wh° ruled the kingdom of Commagene during the first century in what is now southeast Turkey. For him- self and his ancestors, he constructed a hierothesion occupying 26,000 square meters at Nemrud Dagi. The core of the structure was a large tomb in the shape of a dome following the contours of the mountain. The structure of the east and west sides of the tomb are similar, with altars comprising architectural groupings and large statues. From the Greek inscriptions on the backs of the low seats of the gods we know that Antiochus claimed to be a descendant of Alexander and that the sanctuary is where both his deceased ancestors and the gods alike were worshipped.29 The content and order of the statues of the eastern and western altars is the same and includes seated images of Antiochus himself together with Zeus, Apollo, an anthropomorphic god of Com- magene, and Heracles (figures 16 and 18). The sculptures are a fusion of Greek, Persian, and Commagene artistic styles. For example, while Heracles still has a beard and carries a club, he is wearing Persian attire and a pointed hat (figure 17). Typi- cal of these cases of fusion, although the image and role of Heracles in Central Asia may have changed, the characteristic club and lion skin 29 Donald H.

THE "MODIFIED HERACLES" OF GANDHARAN ART. The Gandhara region was a hub of cultural interchange between the Eurasian continent and the Indian subcontinent. As is well known, in the late вс/early ad period, the region fell under Scythian, Indo- Greek, Parthian, and Kushan control, and from the first century ad Buddhist art in the region was deeply influenced by Greece.31 As Errington and Cribb, compilers of The Crossroads of Asia have written, in the Greek kingdom of Bactria a purely classical Greek style was preserved (figure 21), but in Gandhara and India there was a trans- formation. Many figures of Greek mythology had their heads and faces changed so that the god of fortune, Tyche/Fortuna, became Hariti and Heracles became Vajrapani, guardian of Sakyamuni.32 There is a wealth of material and studies on the subject; here only a few examples are presented to explain how Heracles went from being a purely classical Greek figure to being a guardian god in the Buddhist pantheon. The first example is a standing stone figure of Heracles very much in the Gandharan style found in a private collection in Japan (figure 22).33 His nude body is inclined a bit to the right, and his left leg ex- tends outward to the left with the weight resting on the right foot. The pose is Greek, but the representation of the musculature lacks the Greek realism and muscled physique, and it manifests typical Gandharan soft- ness and plumpness. The expression of the head, the face and the hair are also fairly typical of Gandharan art and represent a departure from Greek classicism. But in his left hand, he holds a club that rests on the ground and is smaller at the upper end and thicker at the lower with clear protuberances. The left hand is held in front of the body, and a lion skin is draped across the arm. These elements are basically a con- tinuation of the typical aspect of the Greek Heracles. He is standing in 30 Not all are that easily distinguished. Cf. К. Fischer, "Icons of Heracles and Alexander in the Eastern Part of the batter's Empire," in G.

While it is difficult to discern from the incomplete picture whether he is standing next to a Buddha, he has assumed the stance of a protector. His location in a niche is typical of Gandhara. Representative of the clear transformation of Heracles into Vajra- pani are the Buddha and "Heracles- Vajrapani" excavated in Afghani- stan in 1973 at the ruins of Tapa Shotor at Hadda (figures 23, 24). The Heracles excavated here next to the image of Buddha clearly retains the Greek face and the exposed, realistic muscled physique.34 Draped over his left shoulder is a lion's pelt with head attached and the club in his right hand has become nothing less than the weapon of Vajrapani. While the number of statues of Heracles, carved from rock or molded from clay, recovered from this area is quite large (figure 25),35 this piece from about the first century ad is evidence of the direct development of Gandharan art from Hellenized Bactrian art.36 From a second-to-third-century painted clay bust of Vajrapani in the collection of the Kamakura Silk Road Research Institute in Japan (figure 26) and a stone sculpture of a Gandharan Vajrapani (figure 27) from about the same period in the British Museum, we can see clearly how the particularly Greek characteristics of Heracles gradually faded and the Indie coloration of Gandhara became stronger. The Kamakura bust is wearing lion-skin headgear that is virtually the same as that of Heracles, and the paws attached to the head are crossed beneath the bust's chin. The face of the god retains a strong Grecian flavor, and although the beard is not long, it covers both cheeks. But the clothing covering the shoulders and the chest is obvious and no longer like the usual nude body of Heracles. Another obvious change is that Vajrapa- ni's vajra has replaced the club of Heracles. The sculpture fragment in the British Museum comprises only the right half of a rectangular bas-relief containing the figures of four persons. All four figures are gazing to their right toward a figure (not 34 For the site report, see M. Z.

In the upper register of the frag- ment is a figure of a king or ruler and beside him is a monk in robes. Beneath him is a similarly attired monk. Next to the lower monk is the figure portrayed as Vajrapani that concerns us. Vajrapani is stand- ing in a relaxed stance with his body slightly turned to his right and his weight on his left foot. On his head is the lion-skin headgear with the attached legs crossed below his chin. There is no doubt that this headgear derives from Heracles, but the club that is the signature of Heracles is missing; in its place he holds the vajra in the right hand and a long sword in the left. Neither does he sport the thick beard of Heracles, though his likeness seems Indian. Only above the mouth is there a small moustache. Some of the characteristic features of the Greek Heracles are retained in the firm musculature revealed in the naked upper body, exposed shoulders and tapered waist and in the slightly inclined stance. A very similar Vajrapani can be seen at the Kizil grot- toes in China's Xinjiang province. THE TRANSFORMED HERACLES IN CHINA Fourth to Sixth Centuries Between Kucha №([ and Baicheng counties in Xinjiang, some seven kilometers southeast of Kizil township in caves on the north bank of the Muzart River, is the largest Buddhist grotto in what was the an- cient state of Qiuci ШШ. According to the noted Chinese archeologist Su Bai ®Й, the Kizil grottoes, "are located in the region between the Bamiyan grottoes in Afghanistan to the west of the Congling Moun- tains and the various grottoes east of Xinjiang. The number of Kizil grottoes with murals from the early period preserved in them far sur- pass Bamiyan, and the dating of the Kizil grottoes from the first stage predates the earliest remaining grottoes east of Xinjiang by at least ioo years."37 The key role of this site in the diffusion of Buddhist art is obvious. A Vajrapani figure that is very similar to that in the Brit- ish Museum described above is found in the main mural in the central hall of cave 175, which has been dated by Su Bai to period 2, that is, 395-53° (figure 28, below).38 37 Su Bai fü E=3 , "Xinjiang Baicheng Kezier shiku bufen dongku de leixing yu niandai" in idem, ZJwngguo shiku si yanjiu ф (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 1996), p. 37. 38 Some scholars believe the correct dating is somewhat later, from the mid-6th to the first half of the 7th c.

The front chamber is not preserved, but the main chamber has a remaining length of 230 cm, width 320 cm, and height 360 cm with a vaulted ceiling, the center of which il- lustrates the heavens and the two sides of which illustrate parables and jataka stories. On the rear wall of the main chamber in the upper register are two deva entertainers bending downward and three flying devas. On either side of the top of the niche in the rear wall is a figure of a dharmapala. The one on the right is wearing a multi-pointed felt cap and has body armor. With one leg crossed, he sits on a high seat. The figure we wish to note, however, is the one on the left. His shape is similar, but his costume is different . On his head he wears a lion/ti- ger helmet very similar to that of the Vajrapani in the British Museum described previously and has the attached paws crossed beneath the chin. In his left hand, he holds a religious ring-like object and his right grasps the vajra.39 From the coloring of the mural, we know that the color of the torso is quite different from that of the exposed parts of the body (face, feet, and so on), moreover, the garment he is wearing has a collar and lapels. A lokapala dating from the same period and another from a some- what later period whose headgear is very similar to that in Cave 175 are found respectively in Caves 26 and 41 at the Simsim grottos not far from the Kizil grottos (figures 29, 30).40 Moving eastward, by the time of Northern Zhou (561-581) at the very latest, this headgear had reached Cave 4 of the Maijishan grottos at Tianshui ^7jc. The main wall of the front hall contains a bas-relief of devas and others of the eight classes (nagas, yaksas, asuras , and so on). Among them is the Tishushi 3 (2001), p. 348.

The explanations accompanying plates 17 and 18 have the right and left lokapalas reversed, and the explanations do not completely match the plates. The iconic origin of the vajra , of course, is the thunderbolt of Zeus, and it is often referred to as such in discussions of Indian art and in the preceding section of this article. However, in Chinese art it had already lost the asso- ciation with the thunderbolt. 40 See Zhongguo bihua quanji bianji weiyuan hui ed., Zhongguo Xinjiang bihua quanji ФШ idilli 11^:111 (Shenyang and Urumqi: Liaoning meishu chubanshe and Xinjiang meishu chubanshe, 1995) 5, pll. 10, 46.

On his head is the lion/tiger headgear with eyes and nose clearly depicted but without the paws crossed beneath the chin. He is no longer nude but wears armor. The right hand makes the vitarka-mudra. The left hand is damaged and one can only perceive in front of the lower abdomen an indistinct hand that appears to grasp a sword whose point is resting on the ground (figure 31).41 Comparing this figure with that of the Vajrapani in Cave 175 at Kizil, the only link between the two is the lion/tiger headgear. A similar situation is found with Cave 4 of the Gongxian ЩЩ grotto in Henan province. This cave is generally recognized as having been dug during the late-Northern Wei (386-534) or the beginning of the sixth century. Each of the four sides of the base of the central pillar contains a lokapala , and among them on the north face is a lion lokapala. The special characteristic of the latter is that he is wearing lion-skin headgear and the paws are crossed beneath the chin. Another special characteristic is the presence of wing-like mane on either side at the back (figure 32).42 A cursory examination suggests that the farther east one goes, the more the special characteristics of the Greek Heracles are dropped, added to, or modified. As he was transformed into Vajrapani in Gandhara, Heracles lost the club. As he moved from the tra- ditionally so-called Western Re- gions (modern Xinjiang) into the Hexi МШ region of China, he ceased to be completely nude. He was made first to cover him- self partially with a necklace of precious stones or a decorated belt, or he was simply dressed in armor.

But in fact, this is not what occurred. On closer examination, we find that the two major distinguishing features of Heracles - the club and the lion-skin headgear with attached claws - sometimes complete, sometimes scattered, surprisingly still clearly appear elsewhere on Bud- dhist sculpture of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (317-589) pe- riod and on Tang-era (618-907) pottery warriors. The sites known so far where such images have been found are as widely separated as Si- chuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and Hebei. And the "missing" club of Heracles in fact is still seen in the hands of the lokapalas and in Cave 77 at Kizil. Following chronological order, we shall first discuss Kizil Cave 77 (figure 33). 43 Cave 77 has a central column. The front wall of the main room, the cave ceiling, and the side walls are largely damaged. The remnant side-walls have depictions of the Buddha discussing the law of cau- sation. The mural of the cowherd in the collection of the Museum of Indian Art in Berlin is from the side-wall mural of the Bud- dha discussing the law. King Bimbisara invited the Buddha and accompany- ing monks to reside with him and discuss the law. 43 Tokyo kokuritsu hakubutsukan Doitsu Shirukurõdo tankentai seiiki bi- jutsuten , iWl/? □- (Tokyo: Tokyo kokuritsu hakubutsukan, 1991), pl. 12. 127 Figure 33.

Nanda asked the Buddha about herding, and the Buddha explained the laws of cow herding using twelve events. Nanda consequently ex- hibited reverence for the Buddha and left home to become one of his disciples.44 The remnant mural depicts the cowherd listening to the Buddha explain the law. On the left side, one can still see a part of the Buddha's shaved head and his seat. Nanda is standing with both hands resting on a club. Behind him two cows are resting on the ground. Of interest here is the apparent connection between Heracles and the shape of the club and the cows. Dating from almost the same time is a club of similar shape in the hands of a lokapala found recently with a Southern Dynasties statue of the Buddha, dating from the late-fifth to the early-sixth century. In June 1990, four similar-looking stone Buddhas were discovered during construction of a shopping mall in Chengdu, Sichuan.45 Among them are two inscribed with dates - Jianwu ÜÄ 2 of the Southern Qi ÍÍÍH dynasty (495) and Tianjian 10 of the Liang Ш (511), providing solid dating material for this group. Of these, item number 9oCST(5): i has only the lower half remaining. According to the original report, "each side of the stone image has a bas relief of a mahãrãjadeva. They are damaged. Both hands grasp a vajra."46 The report contains only a line drawing of the original stone image (figure 34). Concerning the line drawing: 1. because the upper body is missing and the lower body is only sketched, it cannot be determined whether the figure is a vira (Ch.: lishi ýjzt) or a mahãrãjadeva (Ch.: tianwangžJK3L)' and 2. the hands are clearly grasping a long club, not a vajra as stated by the report. One need only compare the form of the vajra held by the vira in item 9oCST(5):5 from the same group to see the difference.47 A similar error was made with item 9oCST(5):7- This piece is very well preserved. The front contains a Buddha and four bodhisat- tvas. Concerning the sides, the report says, "Each side has a bas-relief of a lokapala . The face and eyes look extremely fierce.

His waist is belted, and both hands are grasping a vajra in front of the chest."48 Again, all one need do is compare these with the vajra held by the vira on either side of the front of the same stone to know that the lokapala are not holding vajras but clubs whose surface has indentations and protrusions and which are tapered from bottom to top. Moreover, the line drawing shows the figure not to be wearing a cowl but a leather or metal helmet (figure 35, above). Described correctly is item goCST^ig. This stone fragment is badly damaged, and the front face has a Buddha and two bodhisattvas. According to the report, "on each side of the figure is a carved lokapala standing barefoot on a dais with curled hair parted in the middle, a short jacket with tight sleeves, a belted waist, and both hands grasping a club- like object in front of the body." The line drawing (figure 36) shows the club as tapered from bottom to top, with protrusions and crooked. The common characteristic of these three vira and deva kings (. shenwang is that they are all positioned on either side of the im- age of the primary statue. The shape of their clubs, strictly speaking, is different. One is comparatively smooth, one has protuberances and is crooked, and the third has symmetrical protuberances and indenta- tions. All of them are thicker at the lower end. Thus, it is safe to con- clude that they can all trace their ancestry back to Heracles' club. As for the headgear, one image is damaged, so we cannot know what it had, one has curled hair parted in the middle, and one is clearly wear- ing a leather or metal helmet. A stone image from Wanfosi ¡ЩШ# in the Sichuan Provincial Mu- seum also has a vira that holds a similar club.49 For example, the club can be seen on either side of the back of an image of Säkyamuni (no. W5Z41) dated Putong езЙ 4 (523 ad) of emperor Wu of Liang, either side of the rear of a statue dated Zhongdatong 5 (533), and the right side of a stele (no. WSZ50) commemorating the commissioning of a statue. Two more images held by the Sichuan University Museum dated Zhong Datong 4 (532) and Taiqing ЖЖ 3 (549) of the Liang dynasty have viras holding similar clubs on either side (figures 37-40).50 48 Ibid., p. 1 1. 49 Yuan Shuguang "Sichuan sheng bowuguan cang Wanfo si shike zaoxiang zhengli jianbao" ттттттшт^ттшшттш, ww2 ooi.™, PP. 19-38. 50 Huo Wei "Sichuan daxue bowuguan shou cang de hang zun Nanchao shike zao- xiang" WW 2001.10, pp. 39-44.

For we find virtually the same form of club in the hands of Tang pot- tery warriors from a slightly later period (see below). We can go so far as to say that from the second or third century onward the "Heracles- type club" had already become part of the formal vocabulary of artistic expression in Central Asia and the surrounding regions. Moreover, it was not always associated with the body of Heracles. This is very simi- lar to the images in Greek art of the thunderbolt in the hands of Zeus that symbolized his authority, or Poseidon's trident. When these made their way to Central Asia, they were adapted by rulers there and shown being held by them.51 If we take our analysis a step further, we find that for this sort of club to have appeared in the hands of a cowherd is not without reason. One need only examine a bit closer the story of Heracles to know that two of the Twelve Labors involved cattle. One was the command to capture alive the Cretan bull that carried Europa, with whom Zeus was smitten, and which had been cursed by Poseidon and had become mad (figure 41, above); the other was the command to seize the herd raised by the three-headed giant Geryon.52 In the latter story Heracles uses his club to slay Geryon and his herd dog. Given this story as background, it is not at all surprising that Heracles' club made its way into the hands of Central Asian cowherds. In addition, Heracles' lion-skin headgear was not completely aban- doned. At the very least, it is discernible in Caves 97 and 224 at Kizil. These two caves date from sometime during the Northern and South- ern dynasties to the Sui dynasty (420-617). Recently Yao Shihong Ш carefully identified the attire of the Vajrapani found in a depic- tion of the Buddha subjugating six heretical teachers (figure 42). 53 The original wall painting had been blackened by smoke, and the Vajra- pani had erroneously been assumed to have his head covered by the cowl of a cape. In fact, he is wearing a tiger-skin headgear. According to Yao Shihong, The first figure on the [Buddha's] right, previously always mis- takenly identified as wearing a cap, in fact wears a tiger-skin hel- met. Because of discoloration by smoke, the original colors have blackened but one can still see the erect ears and broad nose of the tiger in the painting. The tiger-skin spreads as it drapes to the shoulders, suggesting that it extends to both sides and to front 51 Errington and Cribb, Crossroads of Asia, pll. 39-44, 47. 52 Kerényi, Heroes of the Greeks , pp. 158-59, 163-74.

One can see only that the front part of the pelt gradually narrows to form a belt that is tied at mid chest. It reveals a round face in the Kuchean style with a pair of raised eyebrows and the eyes, ears and nose placed close together. The upper body is exposed, the shoulders are wrapped with a flowing ribbon, there are bracelets on both wrists, and a bangle at the elbow. The left hand holds a vajra at chest height while the right hand holds a duster above the head.

This question is discussed in more detail, below. Aside from the wall-paintings from this period, the lion- or tiger- skin headgear is seen also on a warrior figurine held by the Palace Museum in Beijing. This figurine is 49 cm tall (figure 44). According to Zhongguo meishu quanji , "This figurine wears an animal-head helmet, its torso is attired in armor, and below it is dressed in a long skirt. The hand holds a missing implement."56 The "animal helmet," from its eyes, nose and teeth, is clearly distinguishable as a tiger or lion. What is un- usual is a column that protrudes from the top of the helmet. Because it is not possible to view the object from the side, from the illustration it is not possible to determine immediately just what the protuberance is. Regardless, the form of the headgear on this piece and similar pieces from the Sui-Tang period, discussed below, are mutually corroborative and evidence that following the transformation of the headgear and club of Heracles, they could appear separately or together. Seventh to Ninth Centuries Now we turn to the question of the separation of the club from the lion/tiger headgear and their acquisition of an independent existence. A considerable number of Tang warrior figurines has been unearthed (table 4). These figurines wear lion- or tiger-skin headgear, and they either grasp a sword or are empty handed. None holds a club. The eleven figurines listed in the accompanying table are but a very small part of the total number discovered, and the majority were found in Hebei province in north China. Does this suggest that particular geo- graphic considerations are involved? For example, did this particular head dress enter north China along the still unobstructed Silk Road?57 This is a question that will bear further examination but which cannot 55 Zhongguo shiku : Kezier shiku , vol. 3, pl. 220. 56 Zhongguo meishu quanji: diaosu bian ШИШ (Beijing: Renmin meishu chubanshe, 1988) 4, pl. 33, p. 11. 57 I wish to express my appreciation to Mr. Qi Dongfang ЩШл for his comments during the conference "History of Ancient Relations between China and the World," and for the op- portunity to consult his paper that was read at the conference, "Yisilan boli yu sichou zhi lu" in the conference collection "Gudai Zhong wai guanxi shi, xin shiliao de diaocha, zhengli yu yanjiu guoji xueshu yantao hui lunwen huibian" November 15-16, 2002, pp. 225-31.

Rather than examining this issue, however, the question for the present article is how we can convincingly show that the independently occurring lion/tiger-skin headgear and club also trace their origins back to distant Greece. When one seeks to verify the relationship among particular "unique" elements in a cultural dif- fusion, it is often easy to fall into arbitrariness. If there should be a "group" of elements occurring together, then the case becomes much more persuasive. Fortunately, in addition to the examples of the inde- pendent appearance of these two elements, we can find cases where the two are found together. In 1975, an early-Tang brick tomb of a couple was excavated south- west of the old city of Anyang Srßfl, in Henan.58 According to the stone epitaph found in the tomb, the occupant, Yang Kan tìlfffi, was born in the year Kaihuang Ufi Ж 5 (585) of the Sui dynasty and died in Yonghui 5 (654) of emperor Gaozong i^jth of the Tang; his wife was born in Kaihuang 16 (596) and died in Shangyuan J Z7C 2 (675) of Gaozong. Because the tomb had flooded, the ceiling collapsed and the funerary objects were all scattered. Among them were six warrior figures. Accord- ing to the site report, the figurines were divided into three types. Types I and II are especially noteworthy. The report describes them thus, Type I : 0.575 m high. On the head is a tiger-head helmet. The figure's eyes are round and glaring, and it has two protruding inci- sors, and a goatee. It has red armor on the shoulders and has on a neck protector. On the armor, the plates are outlined in black, and the waist is tied with a purple and red belt. The figure is wearing black boots, his right hand is clenched in a fist across his chest, and the left hand rests on a sword. Type II: 0.575 m high. The head is slightly lowered and the figure is wearing a helmet, has red armor on the shoulders, and wears a neck protector. The waist is belted with a green belt, and he wears black boots. The left hand rests on the hip and the right hand on a long staff, (the staff is 0.36 m). The right arm is broken off. These two are perhaps two of the four tomb spirits, Dangkuang HíS and Dangye HW.59 The report contains illustrations of the two figurines, labeled plates 5-1, 3. The plates are not very clear, but enough so that we may 58 Anyangshi bowuguan "Tang Yang Kan mu qingli jianbao" §1 ШШ, Wenwu ziliao congkan ЗсЩуЩЩШТ 'J 1982.6, pp. 130-33. 59 Ibid., p. 130. *35</page><page sequence="34">I-TIEN HSING correct some inaccuracies in the report (figures 45, 46). First, "Type I," is said to be resting his left hand on a sword, but closer exami- nation reveals the left hand to be resting on a tapered club, not a sword. Unfor- tunately, the poor qual- ity of the illustration does not permit us to determine what the club's surface is like. Second, the report says that the "Type II" figurine is wearing a "hel- met" but does not specify what kind of helmet. If one compares it with the "Type I" figurine, it is easily seen that in fact it is a tiger-head helmet with the tiger's eyes and nose. Only the left ear is missing. Thus both figu- rines are wearing similar tiger-head helmets and each is holding a club - one comparatively shorter and held in the left hand, the other very much longer and held in the left hand. The longer club of the "Type II" figurine is tapered and significantly has numerous discernible pro- trusions. The report refers to the helmet as a "tiger-head helmet," but the illustration is insufficiently clear to determine whether it is a tiger's head or a lion's head. Whichever, the two trademarks of Heracles have unexpectedly appeared in this fashion on Tang warrior figures. Is this simply fortuitous? The report carefully points out, "The form of the warrior figurine is similar to those excavated in the Shanxi region."60 By "Shanxi region" is meant the Tang tombs at Beishicao Й5Ш, in Changzhi ÂÍp county. In 1 96 1, two Tang-dynasty brick tombs were discovered at Beishicao in the eastern suburb of the Changzhi county seat.61 The shape of the two tombs was similar, and they were over 100 meters apart.

Tomb No. 3 dates from about the same period. On each side of the entrance to Tomb No. 3 was found a warrior figurine. The site report says, "The item found on the left side of the entrance is wearing red armor and green ribbons. Below the chin are two round buttons. The waist is belted and the feet have black boots. The left hand rests on the hip while the right hand rests on a long staff. The figurine is 58 cm high. The warrior figure to the right of the tomb opening wears a tiger helmet on which cloud patterns are painted in red, green, and blue. The armor is grass-green, and a red cloth is draped over the shoulders. There are black shoes on the feet, and the two hands rest on a long staff."62 Besides this brief sketch, the report con- tains two illustrations that are not clear (figures 47 and 48; originally labeled plates VIII. 1-2). Their postures are rather differ- ent, as are the shapes of the helmets. What is interesting, however, is that both figures are holding a club very similar to that seen in Cave 77 at Kizil. Even more striking is the figure from the left side of the tomb opening. Not only is he holding a club, but he is also wearing the lion/tiger-head headgear. The occurrence together of the club and the headgear is not simply a fortuitous creation of the artisan but must have been the result of a particular development. How this development underwent alterations and changes as it made its way to the Central Plains region of China probably no one can 62 Ibid., p. 66. I37 Figures 47 (I.) and 48 (rt.).

However, we can venture to say that if one traces it back to its origins, the connection with Heracles is inescapable. Also worth noting is that the original link between the club and lion skin and the image of Heracles has been severed; they have become inde- pendent accoutrements of an entirely different persona. If we examine these together with the eleven figurines listed above, there are several noteworthy phenomena: j. The Tang Figurines Are Essentially Warriors This can be determined from the few pieces whose placement is relatively clear: these figurines were placed on either side of the tomb path or entrance. They held weapons and displayed a martial power, undoubtedly as symbolic protectors of the tomb. Their role is similar to Vajrapani or the gandharva responsible for guarding the law in the wall paintings and sculptures in the Buddhist grottoes. Clearly, although "Heracles" had changed appearance before he entered China, his origi- nal function as warrior and guardian was essentially unchanged. 2. the Status of the Herculean Figure Had Declined In Greece, Rome, and Central Asia Heracles and the rulers - be it Alexander, the emperors of Rome or the kings of Parthia or Kushan - were associated with, and had positions of, incomparable respect. Within the matrix of Buddhist art, however, Heracles was transformed into one or the other of Sakyamuni's host of Vajrapani, lokapalas, viras , or gandharvas, not only losing a position of veneration in his own right but being demoted from the position of principal to that of attendant. His sacred and invincible club was retained through the transforma- tion to Vajrapani or vira , sometimes as a club, sometimes in the form of a vajra. In the wall paintings of Kizil, the club had become an object held by a lowly herder. Only the lion-skin headgear continued to be prized and worn on the head of the warriors. 3. The Headgear and Club Had Become Iconic Among the warrior figurines found in Shanxi and Henan prov- inces, the lion-skin headgear and the club are both present in some cases, while in others there is only the club or the lion-skin headgear. Those so far unearthed in Shaanxi and Hebei provinces have only the headgear; the club has not been found. In contrast, in Sichuan we find only the club without the lion/tiger-skin headgear. From this, one can see that the lion/tiger-skin headgear and the club had become iconic elements with independent existences, adapted to figures of an entirely 138</page><page sequence="37">HERACLES IN THE EAST different type and status. Moreover, they had already lost their original significance as representative of a particular personage. 4. The Ox and the Herder Nanda The ox at the feet of the warrior figurine unearthed at Luoyang, Henan, conjures up an association with the herder Nanda in the Kizil grottoes and with Heracles, who subdued the mad ox. Besides the link- age of the element of the ox, warriors unearthed in Xian county, Hebei, have an image resembling Medusa on their chests, as Xie Mingliang has conclusively shown.63 One might note that in completing his elev- enth labor, Heracles battled Medusa in Hades and discovered that she was merely an empty image.64 That such figures and formalistic ele- ments that were originally linked to the story of Heracles were able ultimately to persist in this way, appearing in Tang-wall paintings and on sculpture and pottery figures, is astounding. Finally, there is the question of whether the headgear worn by the Tang-period Vajrapani and warriors were the pelts of lions or tigers. Chinese scholars, for example, Xiang Da [rIjÉ and Duan Wenjie have consistently referred to the headgear as a tiger-skin helmet, tiger-skin hat, or a helmet in the shape of a tiger's head. And virtually all scholars, basing themselves on Fan Zhuo's ЩШ (Tang-era) History of the Barbarians {Man shu SMSr), the "Monograph on the Southern Zhao" of the New Tang History ( Xin Tangshu 0т11Ш, "Nan Zhao zhuan ffifSÍÍ"), the "Monograph on the Tufan" of the Old Tang History (Jiu TangshviWiMli, "Tufan zhuan ttÜHW"), and a caption in Cave 144 of the Mogao Grotto in Dunhuang, have seen the tiger-skin headgear as based on the garb of the Tufan warriors and so assigned the motifs origins to Tufan.65 In 1998, Li Qiqiong's discussion of Dunhuang wall paint- ings of the Tufan period concluded that the mahãrãjadevas and the vi- ras that wore tiger-head headgear and had tiger skins draped around their shoulders "were Buddhist guardians whose form is modeled on Tufan warriors."66 In 1999, in order to resolve the question of the Tu- fan Cave in the Qiuci grotto, Yao Shihong carefully collected materials relating to headgear style. He reaffirmed the position held by Xiang, Duan and Li, stating "these depictions are based on Tufan warriors who have achieved merit in battle; they reflect the uniform of honor 63 Xie, "Xila meishu," pp. 41-50. 64 Kerényi, Heroes of the Greeks , pp. 180-81; Grimal, Dictionary of Classical Mythology, p. 201. 65 On the Tufan, see n. 4, above. 66 Li Qijing, "Lun Tufan shiqi de Dunhuang bihua yishu" Dun- huang y anjiu 1998.2, pp. 1-19. !39</page><page sequence="38">I-TIEN HSING of the Tufan warrior." Going even further, he concludes, " dhar map alas wearing a tiger skin as clothing and as headgear could have appeared in the Mogao and Yulin grottos only following the Tufan occupation of the Hexi region, and they disappeared with the end of Tufan rule. They had obvious ethnic and temporal characteristics."67 There is some evidence for the view that the tiger-skin apparel originated with the Tufan. The "Monograph on the Tufan" of the New Tang History contains a clear statement, "The slope is all tumuli. Next to them are sheds. They paint them in red and illustrate them with white tigers. All the barbarian nobles who have gained merit in battle wear the [tiger] pelts when they are alive, and they use them to symbolize their bravery after they are dead."68 The Southern Zhao, which were strongly influenced by the Tufan, had similar attire,69 and the section on customs in Fan Zhuo's History of the Barbarians contains reliable ac- counts.70 A vira depicted in a wall-painting in Cave 15 of the Yulin Ш # Grotto of Anxi Зс® is wearing a cap that clearly shows tiger stripes, and behind the figure the tail and paws of a tiger are clearly visible (fig- ure 49). Thus, there is no problem with saying that this particular vira is draped in a tiger skin with a tiger-head headgear. This sort of clearly distinguishable tiger-head headgear is also seen on the gandharva and Vaisr avana fragment of the Tang silk painting in the British Museum (figure 50). 71 The gandharva in the painting is wearing a tiger's head headgear with visible stripes, and a tiger's tail hangs down behind and curls between the figure's feet. Similar headgear is seen on a gandharva in a fragment of a painting on silk from a Turfan grotto that is in the 67 Yao, "Guanyu Xinjiang Qiuci shiku," p. 70. 68 Xin Tangshu 141B, p. 6103. 69 Examples of the Southern Zhao and Dali warriors wearing tiger-skin headgear or apparel and representations of Southern Zhao and Dali kings are found in the painting "Nan Zhao tu zhuan" in the Yurinkan, Kyoto, or in the painting "Zhang Shengwen hua juan" ШШ ("Zhang Shengwen Picture Scroll"; also referred to as "Dali guo fan xiang juan" or "Buddhist Image Scroll of the Dali Kingdom"), now in the Palace Museum, Taipei. The depiction of a king wearing the tiger-skin headgear appears in "Kings of the Sixteen States" section of the "Zhang Shengwen Picture Scroll." Warriors wearing tiger-skins appear in two places on "Nan Zhao tu zhuan." See Li Linxuan -Nan Zhao Dali guo xin ziliao de zonghe yanjiu (Taibei: Gugong bowuyuan, 1982), pp. 106, 122, 129. 70 Fan Zhuo Manshu jiaozhu ed. Xiang Da 'ц'Ш (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1962). Section 8 of this work, which describes the customs of the Man and Yi, says, "[They] esteemed the two colors crimson and purple. After attaining purple, if one achieved great merit he attained brocade. Further, those who had extraordinarily special merit got to drape themselves completely in a tiger ( boluo ) skin. The next rank of merit got to drape their chest and back but omitted the sleeves. The next rank of merit got to drape the chest and omitted the back. They called it "skin of the great beast" (da chong pi); it was also "tiger skin."

These must have had an ori- gin other than Tufan. An example is the gandharva found in the depiction of the Maitreya scene on the north wall of the main hall of Cave 25 at Yulin, Anxi (figure 53). 74 This cave belongs to the Tang, and the painting is extremely beautiful and clear. Only the head of the gandharva is visible, and he is wearing a lion-skin head- gear. The head shows eyes, ears, and the nose, and the paws are tied beneath the fig- ure's chin. There is no sign of tiger markings or stripes. On the contrary, the lines drawn outward from the head are Figure 54. Woodblock Print Maitreya Paper 8go ad.

The discussion of the art in this cave in ZJiongguo shiku: Anxi Tulin ku Щ describes the figure as dressed in a tiger skin. Because the figure is white, absence of the tiger's coloring is explained by saying that the skill with which the lines are drawn made it unnecessary. This view results perhaps from focusing too narrowly on the human figures and paying insufficient attention to the different characteristics of lions and tigers. (Curiously, the descriptions of the individual plates later in the book correctly identify the pelt as that of a lion.)75 A lion-skin headgear with mane intact is also clear in the British Museum woodblock print dating from Tang Longji IIIS 2 (890) (figure 54).

Although it is a frag- ment, the lion-skin headgear with mane is entirely clear.76 Aside from the foregoing examples, it is impossible to distinguish between a lion skin or a tiger skin in the majority of cases that can presently be seen in wall-paintings, sculpture, and pottery figures. In some cases this is a result of the poor quality of the plates, while in oth- ers it is because of a lack of a clear delineation in the original object. In Tang-period art one finds examples of Vajrapani, mahãrãjadevas , and gandharva wearing tiger-skin headgear with a pelt draped over the body, and one sees examples with a lion skin. These are not isolated cases. Bearing this in mind, first we should avoid referring to these types of headgear simply as a tiger-skin hat, a tiger-skin helmet, or a casque in the shape of a tiger's head. They should be separately de- noted. Second, regardless of whether the headgear of the Vajrapani and the mahãrãjadevas in Cave 175 at Kizil and Cave 4 at Maijishan are lion or tiger skins, they date anywhere from several hundred to more than a hundred years prior to the Tufan.77 To attribute the origin of the headgear style to Tufan warrior attire is therefore mistaken. Two possibilities must be considered. First, the lion skin worn by the Vajrapani that developed in Gand- haran Buddhist art through a transformation of the figure of Heracles may have become a tiger skin. Because I have been unable to exam- ine the objects themselves and have not seen any relevant studies by specialists, I am as yet unable to judge the likelihood of such a pos- sibility. The second alternative is that this transformation is incomplete with Gandharan art; both lion- and tiger-skin headgear are found. But the distinction tends to be unclear. An example is the previously dis- cussed fourth- or fifth-century clay bust excavated at the No. 1 site of the Toqquz Sarai Monastery in Tumshuq, Xinjiang, which is in the collection of the Guimet Museum in Paris. The bust is wearing an ani- mal-skin headgear with clearly rendered eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and fangs. From the front, the face could be that of either a lion or a tiger, but from the side, since neither mane nor tiger's stripes are apparent, there is no way of determining whether in fact this is a lion or a tiger 7&lt;&gt; Matsumoto Eiichi , Tonkõ ka no kenkyü (Tokyo: 1937) 2, pl. 122a. 77 Li Qijing considers the caves to have been constructed during the sixty-seven years be- tween 781 (Jianzhong 2), when the Tufan subjugated Shazhou (Dunhuang), and 848 (Dazhong 2), when Zhang Yichao of Dunhuang took back the twelve zhou of the Hexi region, to be "Tu- fan caves."

Because I am not a specialist in either Gandharan art or in Chi- nese Buddhist sculpture, I am reluctant to jump to hasty conclusions. But should we not perhaps consider the question of the origins of the custom among Tufan and Nan Zhao warriors of wearing the pelts of beasts? In doing so, we should first take into account that this custom was already widespread in Central Asia and India. There were consid- erable cultural contacts between these regions and the Tufan, and the latter subsequently adopted Buddhism. Considered in this way, it would seem that we cannot exclude the possibility that the Tufan warriors were modeling themselves on the figures of Vajrapani and lokapalas who were draped with a lion skin.79 At this point our understanding of 78 See Shiruku rodo dai bijutsu ten , p. 159, pl. 174. Once more, I want to express my grati- tude to Xie Minglang, who has actually seen this piece and was kind enough to provide pho- tographs taken from the front and the side of the statue. Without these, I would not have been able to have a clear understanding of the side view of the figure. 79 On early Tufan culture (the introduction of Zoroastrianism in the 3d~7th cc. and the conversion to Buddhism in the 7th-8th), see Wang Xiaofu 3£/,ЬШ, Tang Tufan Dashi zheng- zhi guanxi shi (Beijing: Beijing daxue chubanshe, 1992), pp. 1-17, and Xie Jisheng ИШЩ "Jingang cheng Fojiao chuanru Tufan yu Zang zhuan Fojiao shuang- I44</page><page sequence="43">HERACLES IN THE EAST Tufan and early Tibetan culture is still weak, so many questions will have to await answers. CONCLUSION If in searching for traces of cultural contacts between China and the West, one is even a little careless, one can easily misinterpret the data. Over the past century or two, Chinese, Japanese, and Western scholars, based on a growing number of archeological discoveries, have clarified the outlines of these contacts.80 But the materials remain lim- ited, and our understanding is inadequate: misinterpretations and dis- tortions occur all too often.81 The present article, in attempting to trace the origins of the foreign elements on Tang warrior figurines, has fol- shen tuxiang de lishi kaocha" Hualin 2 (2002), pp. 215-26. 80 See for example, Shi shiji qian de sichou zhi lu he dongxi wenhua jiaoliu If (Beijing: Zhongguo shehui kexue chubanshe, 1992); Xinjiang wenwu kaogu yanjiusuo, Xinjiang wenwu kaogu xin shouhuo (igjg-ig8g) (1979- 1989) (Urumqi: Xinjiang renmin chubanshe, 1995); Xinjiang wenwu kaogu xin shouhuo (xu) (iggo-igg6) (1990- 1996) (Urumqi: Xinjiang meishu sheying chuban- she, 997); Sunji ШШ, Zhongguo sheng huo (Shenyang: Liaoning jiaoyu chubanshe, 1996); Lin Meicun Xiyu wenming'^i^oCßR (Beijing: Dongfang chubanshe , 1995); Han Tang xiyu yu Zhongguo юепт^ШШЩШШЙ*Щ1&gt;С.Щ (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 1998); Gu- dao xifeng (Beijing: Sanlian shudian, 2000); Rong Xinjiang Zhong gu Zhong- guo yu wailai wenming (Beijing: Sanlian shudian, 2001). 81 One of the most persistent of these is the assertion that a Roman legion established the Lijian Uff Fortress at modern Yongchang 7Ш in western Gansu "Й*Ш- This particular misin- terpretation has its origins in the fertile imagination of Homer H. Dubs, who in a slim mono- graph based on a lecture delivered before The China Society, London, in 1955, asserted that a Roman legion had been captured in battle and settled near Yongchang (Homer H. Dubs, A Roman City in Ancient China [London: The China Society, 1957]). While Dubs's study is based on a close familiarity with the sources, his conclusions are highly speculative and rest on not impossible but ultimately unsupported assumptions. They were picked up by a free- lance Australian journalist, David Harris, who, with no training in the field, set out to prove Dubs' assertions and published his conclusions and adventures in Black Horse Odyssey (Kent Town: Wakefield Press, 1991). In the wake of Harris's efforts, Yongchang village has come to believe that its inhabitants include descendants of Roman soldiers and has erected monu- ments to commemorate the story. There is even a "legion" of local residents who dress up as Roman legionnaires for local celebration. See Eric Hoh.

In such an enterprise it is of course difficult to avoid misinterpretation. Who could believe that the club and the Hon- or tiger-skin headgear found on Tang warrior figurines originated in the Mediterranean world of ancient Greece? This article has by no means presented all the evidence. Yet from disparate clues it seems that one can discern the eastward migration of the elements that define the image of Heracles and their transforma- tion and persistence in another cultural matrix. Because the influence of Greek art on Gandharan art has long been the subject of study and is generally recognized, I have dealt with it only briefly. I have chosen to place the emphasis on Buddhist art after it entered China; and Hera- clean elements began to appear there in Buddhist sculpture, tomb art, and wall-paintings. The lion-skin headgear or the transformed version, the tiger-skin headgear, can be seen in pictures of mahãrãjdevas , lokapa- las , and gandharvas from the fifth century down into the Tang dynasty. The club and the lion/tiger skin headgear appear simultaneously on the heads of Tang warrior figurines unearthed in Shanxi and Henan. The reappearance of these two elements together suggests that they could not have been coincidentally created by indigenous Chinese artisans. Rather, it is likely that they were influences transmitted from abroad. Also worth noting is that the original link between the club and lion skin and the image of Heracles has been severed; they have become independent accoutrements of an entirely different persona. The figures possessing these two attributes are not the original Greek hero Heracles. Moreover, the hierarchical status of the figures to whom these attributes were assigned appears to have declined over time. Even so, regardless of whether it is a Vajrapani, mahãrãjadeva, lokapala , vira , gandharva , or the guardian of an ordinary modern tomb, their symbolic role - guardian or protector - remains largely the same as that of Heracles' original role in Greek myth. It was entirely possible for Heracles' lion-skin headgear to adapt to local custom and turn into a tiger-skin headgear. After the passage of so much time and distance, for the club to have remained basically unchanged is astounding. While many previous scholars have noted the lion- and tiger-skin headgear, the present article has concentrated on the heretofore little-noticed club in hopes of adding another point for future discussion. If the transformed club and lion/tiger-skin headgear entered China in the wake of Buddhism, questions about the means, the route, and the timing of that migration naturally arise. Answering them will require 146</page><page sequence="45">HERACLES IN THE EAST a comprehensive approach that looks at the dissemination of the art of different sects of Buddhism, regional variants, and workshops and tastes. This is beyond the scope of the present effort. Grotto sculpture and funerary objects belong to different art forms. Through what pro- cess did a guardian attendant of the Buddha become a tomb guardian of an ordinary individual? During the Wei-Jin and Sixteen States periods, Buddhism was already widespread in the Hexi region (modern Gansu and western Inner Mongolia), but in tombs there are no clear traces of Buddhist elements.82 From about the fifth or sixth century, almost si- multaneously vestiges of the club and the lion/tiger skin-helmet appear on Buddhist sculptures in the Kizil Grottos (Xinjiang), the Maijishan Grottos at Tianshui (Gansu), and around Chengdu (Sichuan). In the case of Chengdu, where the club is found, no lion/tiger-skin helmets have been found. By the Sui and Tang periods, with the exception of the examples of the clubs and lion/tiger-skin headgear appearing together that are found in Changzhi (Shanxi) and Anyang (Henan), the bulk of the tiger/lion-skin headgear is found in the Hebei region (Nanhe ffiíP, Yuanshi ТПЙ, Xianxian ШЖ, Anguo 3cH, Dingzhou 5Èjtl and Tianjin ^#). In this area, one does not find the club. The club and the lion/tiger-skin helmet are indeed peripheral ele- ments in the design of Buddhist sculpture, but they should be an indi- cation of the path of the dissemination of Buddhism. For example, at present there are, generally speaking, two theories of the early origins of Buddhist sculpture in the Sichuan region. One says that the chief source was the center of Buddhism at Jiankang (modern Nanjing ШЖ) in the lower reaches of the Yangzi River.83 The other says that 82 There are differing views regarding this phenomenon. I generally accept those of Zheng Yan, in his article cited in n. 57, above. 83 Yuan Shuguang "Chengdu Wanfosi chutu de Liangdai shike zaoxiang" ЙЩЩ Sichuan wenwu ЙШЗШ 1991-3, PP- 27-32; Yang Hong "Si- chuan zaoqi Fojiao zaoxiang" 0jl in Han Tang meishu kaogu yu Fojiao yishu Ш (Beijing: Kexue chubanshe, 2000), pp. 283-90; Luo Shiping Mtä "Sichuan Nanchao fojiao zaoxiang de chubu yanjiu" E9jf in Wu Hong, ed., Han Tang zhi jian de zongjiao yishu yu kaogu (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 2000), p. 397-421; Li Yuqun "Shi lun Chengdu diqu chutu de Nanchao Fojiao shizaoxiang" WW 2000.2, pp. 64-76; Zhang Xiaoma and Lei Yuhua 1Í3iií£, "Chengdu shi Shangyejie Nanchao shike zao- xiang" WW 2001.10, pp. 16-18. In his study of the origins of the stone grotto temples of Sichuan, Ding Mingyi sees three primary sources: the Central Plain, Hexi and the Lower Yangzi. However, his citing of the Chengdu Wanfosi example as proof of Victor Segalen's theory of the Southern Dynasties capital of Jiankang as the origin is basically similar to Yang, Luo and Li.
