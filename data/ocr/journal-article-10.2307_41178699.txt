<plain_text><page sequence="1">PET THEORIES: A Theology for the Dogs1 Stephen H. Webb ^Yriting about dogs in a scholarly essay raises a difficult set of issues concerning style and intention. Scholarship is serious, and seriousness is gravity, sobriety, productivity. Scholarship ap- proaches objects under the category of labor. Dog talk is, by con- trast, a luxury, something personal and private, an aspect of leisure. Dog talk can only appear, in the context of scholarship, as amusing but wasteful, extravagant, and conspicuous, an indis- cretion broached only under the sign of excess or hyperbole. This is, in fact, how we treat our dogs, as extra-economical ob- jects, non-useful splurges, recipients of surplus, frivolous affec- tion, things to be given and given to, things to be treated like toys. Another problem with writing about dogs, or any animals, in terms of their own integrity and autonomy, is that not many peo- ple, it seems, are convinced of the integrity and autonomy even of other human beings, of their capacity to suffer, of their needs and desires for happiness and respect. A certain kind of philo- sophical analysis has taken the existence of other minds, other human minds, that is, as an actual philosophical conundrum, and it might be too much to ask philosophers and theologians to think about the existence of other animal minds, and the ethical obligations that might entail. If we are not sure that we can un- derstand each other, it seems impossible to ask people to take seriously what we share with the rest of the animal world. I will try to bring these two themes, excess and otherness, to- gether, as a way of illuminating what is usually discussed under the heading of animal rights.

Yet our great involvement with domesticated animals complicates and mitigates that other- ness, forcing us to talk about them in many different ways. In fact, my solution to the problem of how to talk about other animals is to turn to the exorbitant nature of the human-dog relationship for a resource for our understanding and treatment of animals in general. When I speak of the exuberance of the human-dog relation- ship, I mean the way in which dogs present themselves to us as gifts, adding something to our lives that is undeserved and yet beneficial, inspiring an uncalculated response. Of course, dogs can be given as property, which subjects them to the processes of the market and commodification, but they also can transcend the economic sphere because they give us more than we can pos- sibly buy. Indeed, dogs not only seem given to us, but their own giving is exorbitant, calling forth from us a matching extrava- gance, making them a paradigmatic instance of the bond that can be created by acts of mutual generosity. Dogs can teach us a lot about gift giving and generosity if we attend to the ways in which our relationships with dogs are excessive and extravagant. I am opposed to the many approaches to dogs, from science to economics and philosophy, that try to reduce the human-dog re- lationship to some functional value, whether psychological, soci- ological, or economic. Treating dogs as gifts can shed light not only on the issues surrounding animal rights but also on our most basic experiences of grace, generosity, and mutual responsi- bility. What is also at stake is what I call the rhetoric of excess: how we value and evaluate those experiences and discourses that transgress the ordinary and the everyday, the prudent and the reasonable. First, a look at the rhetoric of the animal rights literature. Then a look at Christian theology, its failure to apply the lan- guage of giving and grace to the world of animals, and following that an examination of the philosophical and socio-historical problems in the interpretation of dogs. Finally, I will return to my own reading of dogs as a source of excessive giving that can be liberating and transformative.</page><page sequence="3">A Theology for the Dogs 215 The Rhetoric of Animal Rights The ethical question concerning our treatment of animals - in scientific and industrial research, in factory farming, in con- nection with broader environmental issues, in zoos, in sports and hunting, in clothing, in our very own homes - is an urgent and increasingly popular issue in applied philosophy and in the wider public. Most of the philosophical attempts to address this issue revolve around the nature of our responsibility in terms of the traditional language of morality: utilitarianism, as represented by Peter Singer, and rights theory, as represented by Tom Re- gan.2 Both systems begin with and defend the premise that at least some animals feel pain and suffer, and that some animals are self-conscious to a degree. Utilitarians like Singer argue that this suffering must be taken into account when making decisions to maximize happiness or pleasure and minimize pain. Rights theorists like Regan argue (against Kant) that this characteriza- tion of animals should force us to extend to them the notion of rights that is usually understood as a property of homo sapiens alone.3 Both of these modern classics adopt a tone of seriousness and moral earnestness that is quick to pre-empt charges (charges against "animal lovers" that go back at least to Spinoza4) of senti- mentalism, anthropomorphism, and naivete. Singer, for exam- ple, recounts a visit to a woman who is a pet lover and who mistakenly thinks that Singer will share her passion. His reaction to her admittedly superficial expressions of affection for dogs and cats, spoken as she eats a ham sandwich, is barely short of brutal, and he proudly proclaims that he has never been "inordi- nately" fond of pets, that he does not even "love" them.5 He is more serious than that. The little melodrama that Singer recreates serves to announce a turning point in the animal rights movement, a deep division between the traditional humane-society approach to animals (historically and stereotypically dominated by women and con- cerned with companion animals) and the radicalization of the movement (dominated by white, male philosophers and mostly concerned with the scientific, industrial, and agricultural ex- ploitation of animals) . For Singer, it is clear that animals are not to be approached under the auspices of aesthetics or emotion; instead, they serve as an index to our own moral respectability.</page><page sequence="4">216 SOUNDINGS Stephen H. Webb They are a means to our own moral self-understanding. Animals are not something to pet or talk to, but something to think or talk about. What is missing in both of these positions, commendable as they may be, is a more phenomenological grounding of our rela- tionship with animals. "Animals," after all, is only a word, and a sloppy one at that; there is no such thing as an animal, but only individuals; even the propagandists for animal rights organiza- tions realize that people react to animals best not as an abstract category but as individual beings with their own needs, interests, and desires. Most philosophers, however, are cautious about re- lying on emotion or personal and particular experience in dis- cussing animal rights. Animal rights activists are often accused, ignorantly, of operating from a sentimental mode, and so (male) philosophers want to be sure to prove their uninformed critics wrong. The result is a level of discourse that is academically proper but emotionally dry. The calculative morality of utilitarianism and the rigid univer- salism of rights-theory privilege the masculine virtues of analysis, objectivity, and rigor over a feminist ethic of care, intimacy, and compassion.6 Ironically, the most distinctive features of our rela- tionship to animals must be suppressed in order to defend the very integrity of that relationship. Consequently, the dismissal of pets as a philosophically serious problem, and as a potentially profound starting point for reflecting on our relationship with animals, merely reinforces those prejudices that attempt to priva- tize and sentimentalize our relationship with animals in the first place. The discourse about domesticated animals not only has the potential to interrupt more ordinary and acceptable modes of serious discourse, but it also, by that very disruptive power, can show us something about the limits within which we ordinarily speak, and the styles of which we are frequently unaware. Karl Barth's Sacrificial Economy of Animals Christianity traditionally has spoken of creation and all that is in creation as a gift, so that looking at dogs (and by extension all animals) according to the dynamic of the gift should not seem odd. Nonetheless, Christian theology has not been at the fore- front of thinking through the ethical ramifications of treating animals like gifts. On the contrary, Christian theologians have</page><page sequence="5">A Theobgy for the Dogs 21 7 often treated animals as nothing more than useful objects pro- vided by God for our own profit.7 Karl Barth is one of the greatest theologians of our century. His response to Albert Schweitzer's demand that respect be given all life is an honest and revealing exposition of the usual theolog- ical arguments. The context of this discussion is Barth's treat- ment of creation (the natural world) not as a gift in itself but as the presupposition and preparation for the giving of Jesus Christ.8 In a parallel fashion, Barth thinks of animals as given only for humanity's physical needs and spiritual education. The creation of animals is the "dark background to the true work [the creation of humankind] towards which the [creation] narrative hastens."9 Barth is at least sensitive to the possibilities of treating animals ethically. He insists that we should not dismiss Schweit- zer's position as "sentimental."10 Indeed, "Those who can only smile at this point are themselves subjects for tears" (349). Barth is willing to listen to the claims that nonhuman life presents to us through the extremist rhetoric of poets, mystics, and other ec- centrics. "It is hardly an accident that in those who speak along these lines there is usually something strange and even excessive" (350) . On this peculiar issue, Barth complains, we find ourselves at the furthest limit of both what can be thought and what can be done. Although he allows that there is "quite enough human stupidity, severity, caprice and irrationality at work and needing to be curbed" (352), Barth draws back from this limit. Animals, he writes, are provided for humans to use. They are less like a gift than something loaned, then owned, that can be disposed of at will. Barth, however, is too dialectical to dismiss animals this easily. Drawing on the first two chapters of Genesis, which portray a pri- mordial vegetarianism, on portraits in the Prophets of a final and ultimate reconciliation of all things in the new creation, and on Paul's words in Romans about the whole world groaning for liber- ation, Barth admits that when a human kills an animal, it is "at least very similar to homicide" (352). Barth goes as far as to grant that, given ordinary conditions, there can be absolutely no sufficient reason to kill an animal. Why, then, does he not simply agree with Schweitzer? Barth has come almost too close to saying what he does not want to, and so he must quickly search else- where to justify carnivorous practices. As in all of his theological</page><page sequence="6">218 SOUNDINGS Stephen tf. Webb arguments, he appeals to the grace of God. "The slaying of ani- mals is really possible only as an appeal to God's reconciling grace, as its representation and proclamation" (354) . Our free- dom to kill animals, then, is really the burden of a great responsi- bility. We can only take that which has been given to us, and killing an animal must be a form of return. A person can only kill an animal knowing that "it does not belong to him but to God, and that in killing it he surrenders it to God in order to receive it back from Him as something he needs and desires" (355). By implication, when we do kill an animal, it must be done as "a deeply reverential act of repentance, gratitude and praise" (355). God, in other words, still owns the animals, and by killing them we give them back to God (the giver and the taker of all life), who in turn lets us benefit from their death. Justified killing must take the form of both gratitude and guilt because it confirms God as the source of both life and death. As a priestly act, animal killing is a recognition of the power of sacrifice, which is ultimately expressed in the death of Jesus Christ. Only by recapitulating the crucifixion can this precarious frontier of killing animals be crossed. Only by saying grace before a meal can the gracious gift of animals be accepted (that is, consumed) with the proper mixture of gratitude and guilt. This is surely a strange exchange of gifts. Why would God want us to return dead what he has given us alive? How is killing a form of giving? What is the gift of Jesus Christ, that its repetition or representation includes further loss of life? Barth, as always, tries to anticipate his critics. In a crucial passage, he admits that vegetarianism "represents a wanton anticipation of what is de- scribed by Isaiah 1 1 and Romans 8 as existence in the new aeon for which we hope" (356-7). Not only is it ironic that Barth charges vegetarian habits (which restrict and improve one's diet) with being wanton (prurient, unwholesome, craving), but Barth's use of this term also reveals a puzzling hesitation or reservation in his thought. Is vegetarianism wanton because it goes too far on the side of the good, or does it try too hard in the face of human limits and weaknesses? Is vegetarianism really too eagerly eschatalogical, or is it an appropriate response to God's abun- dant giving of life? There is something wanton in our relationship with animals, a giving that urges us not toward sacrifice but toward further giv-</page><page sequence="7">A Theobgy for the Dogs 219 ing. Barth outlines one possible economy of relationships among God, humans and animals, an economy in which what is given must be utilized, consumed, destroyed, both as a sign of respect for the giver and as an acknowledgement of the sacrificial nature of all giving. This model of our relations to animals leads directly to the factory farms where animals are treated as renewa- ble resources to be produced as efficiently as possible. Another kind of economy, as well as another form of sacrifice, would be one in which the given is splurged, abundantly bestowed so that we can kill but we can also receive, cherish, and return, in a par- allel manner, that which is excessive and thus strangely compel- ling. We can give animals back to God by receiving them as gifts in themselves, and we can give to them (and here dogs are so important) as they give to us. In sum, they are not given to us, but we are given for each other. Limits to Otherness Unlike many theologians, Barth was willing to admit that the problem of animals is complex: "It may well be insoluble and barely tangible, but it is genuine and cannot be ignored" (350). The crux of the problem is how to talk about something so simi- lar and yet so very different. Philosophically, animals raise the crucial question of the limits to human knowledge and our ca- pacity to cross those limits in order to understand the truly other. Do animals reside outside of our limits, or are they inside? What would it mean to talk about the other side of a limit? Can we even talk about limits, if we do not know what is other, or more than, that which is limited? What kind of discourse is appropri- ate to the question of limits? Perhaps the simplest way to talk about a limit is to use the language of analogy, that is, to say that something unknown is similar to something that is already known.11 Analogy, however, threatens to reduce the other to the same, appropriating new knowledge only on the basis of what we already know. One of the most helpful guides to sorting out the philosophi- cal problems of talking about animal otherness is Mary Midgley's Beast and Man}2 Drawing on Edward O. Wilson and Konrád Lorenz, Midgley addresses the problem of understanding the animal aspects of our human nature, and how that project affects the way we understand animals. Of course, it is a truism to say</page><page sequence="8">220 SOUNDINGS Stephen H. Webb that we humans are animals. Nevertheless, a fundamental ques- tion - an ancient and complex problem - emerges: Is nature something we have or something we are? Is it something essen- tial or accidental to the human situation? For my purposes, it is interesting to see the ways in which philosophers have defined human nature as an internal differentiation between something called the animal and something - else. Midgley shows that the animality of human nature is a largely mythical beast. Animals symbolize whatever it is that a given phi- losopher or theologian thinks is the negative side of or limit to human nature, and this negativity is then projected onto real ani- mals.13 Humanity's most ancient relationship with animals, then, is built on an intuition into the internal division within human nature, and animals are a necessary means for the articulation of this process of self-definition as self-differentiation. Vice, for ex- ample, becomes equated with acting in an inhuman, or animal manner, and animals thus come to symbolize immorality. For most of Western history animals have not been the other of hu- manity; they are inside us, and only incidentally other than what we most fear about ourselves. Language, that is, gets in the way of otherness. Indeed, it has become popular to argue that otherness is, to use Heidegger's phrase, the great "unthought" of all western sciences and dis- courses. Emmanuel Levinas has argued that philosophy is always organized in order to assimilate the other into the same, and Jac- ques Derrida has maintained that all discourses are governed by economic (self-interested, self-centered, calculative, self-circulat- ing) principles: all attempts to purchase an understanding of the other are actually frugal investments for the maintenance of more of the same. Metaphysics, as well as religion, makes humans the measure of all things, and to the extent that humans are defined by their use of language, then it seems problematical to inscribe within language the arguments for treating animals as ends in themselves, that is, as beings who exist with value outside of the domain of human making, doing, and speaking. Precisely because animals are (allegedly) speechless, the words we speak for them, the words we put into their mouths, are our own, and cannot do them justice.14 Midgley's solution to this set of problems is to try to envision nature as totally independent of human needs or desires. In</page><page sequence="9">A Theology for the Dogs 221 other words, she conceptualizes nature as something ultimately unassimilable into the categories of labor and analysis. Nature is the anti-instrumental realm of free spirit, of play, of excess and art: "The world in which the kestrel moves, the world that it sees, is, and will always be, entirely beyond us. That there are such worlds all around us is an essential feature of our world. Calling the bird's existence 'pointless' means only that it is not a device for any human end. It does not need that external point. It is in some sense ... an end in itself" (359). To substantiate this claim, she draws on Kant's notion of the sublime,15 which demar- cates that which is so overwhelmingly impressive (like mountains or the ocean) that it frustrates our need for understanding and our desire for control, forcing us into a state of amazed admira- tion. "We need the vast world, and it must be a world that does not need us; a world constantly capable of surprising us, a world we did not program, since only such a world is the proper object of wonder" (362). And she concludes her book Animals and Why They Matter with a helpful contrast between a minimalist ethic, based on the principle of parsimony and ruled by prudence, and an ethics of imagination, based on curiosity and sympathy.16 Although Midgley's call for an anti-instrumental view ornature is certainly one step toward a constructive solution, it is impor- tant to note that she does not analyze the ideas of uselessness, excess, and luxury in which she understands that animal world. Indeed, the structure of her argument for the sublime, her asser- tion that we need a world that does not need us, is a bit puzzling: It announces the otherness of the world on the basis of human needs - the world must be other, because that would be nice for us, it would fit in well with our needs. Midgley's pointless world secretly serves a fairly specific pedagogical purpose. Has her own discourse once again reduced the other to the same, that is, re- duced the animal world to an extension of our own needs, wants, and desires? If so, the question remains: What would it mean to get the point of a totally pointless object? What would it mean to know the other as other? The Other as the Same In addition to this philosophical puzzle, there is a socio-histori- cal difficulty of talking about animals. The limit to our under- standing is not only established by the interminable dialectic of</page><page sequence="10">222 SOUNDINGS Stephen H. Webb the other and the same, the similar and the différent. It is also set by social institutions, and thus history, in terms of what is say- able and what is not, and how it is possible to say what you want to say. This is the problem of rhetoric, most broadly construed. As Alasdair Maclntyre has observed, "Every culture is character- ized in part by what it conceals and obscures from view, by what its habits of mind prevent it from acknowledging and appropriat- ing."17 In examining any discourse on otherness we must be sen- sitive not only to what is said but more importantly to what is not talked about, how we go about this not talking, and what that not talking might mean. If our attempt to understand otherness is not merely self-referential masquerade, then we must listen to what is not said in order to understand possibilities that hitherto seem impossible. The socio-historical aspect of the question of limits is aggres- sively pursued by Keith Tester in Animals and Society: The Human- ity of Animal Rights, where he argues that discourse on animal rights is nothing more than a discourse on social morality.18 Ani- mals, he insists, are blank paper upon which we inscribe classifi- catory schemes that reflect our own social organizations, our own attempts at self-knowledge, and not any concern for animals as such. By combining the perspectives of Durkheim and Marx, Tester is able to argue that through animals societies as a whole define and limit themselves. Medieval bestiaries and animal trials substantiate Tester's argu- ment, but so does the rise of the animal rights movement in the 19th century. Historians like Harriet Ritvo and James Turner have connected the beginnings of the animal rights movement in England in the 19th century to the rise in industrialization and class conflict.19 The first bill introduced into Parliament on ani- mals, a bill abolishing bull baiting, was as concerned about social order as about bulls and dogs. Bull baiting was a popular sport for the lower classes, an opportunity for a festive and illicit break from the workday. Fox hunting, by contrast, the proper sport of the upper classes, was not equally protested and prosecuted until recent times. Much of the language about cruelty to animals re- flects a bias against the lower classes; indeed, the RSPCA organ- ized private police to enforce the standards of decency that were violated most often by cab drivers and others who had to use animals. The antivivisection movement, which challenged seien-</page><page sequence="11">A Theology for the Dogs 223 tists and not laborers, was never enthusiastically supported by hu- manitarian groups, and after achieving a peak of sorts by the 1870s, it was destined, by the beginning of this century, to be seen as a fringe movement of cranks and eccentrics. The anti- cruelty groups believed in human progress and fought cruelty as a particularly stubborn sign of anti-progressive forces. The an- tivivisectionist groups were more suspicious of human progress, and saw science as representing the elitism and cunning that was increasingly dominating both nature in general and animals in particular. Contrary to Tester's single-minded thesis, animals are not only a means by which societies establish limits; they also serve as a way in which groups and individuals can test social limits and constraints. There is Coral Lansbury's account, for example, in The Old Brawn Dog, of a series of antivivisection riots that took place in England in 1907. She tells how women and the working class identified with the dogs killed by scientists, and how all three groups - women, the poor, and dogs - were dominated and controlled by the same logic and language that fueled the vivisectors' practices.20 There is also the case of vegetarianism, which traditionally has been a marginalized and unorganized movement of protest submerged within dominant social sys- tems.21 Carol Adams, for example, has argued that historically meat eating has been a male prerogative, and that the language about meat has structural parallels with the language men use about women.22 Tester is much less optimistic about the revolutionary potential of diet. He interprets vegetarianism, with its classical anteced- ents in Pythagoras, Plutarch, and the Neoplatonists, as an alien- ated intellectual rejection of the social order. Meat is the ultimate symbol of socialization. It takes group effort to raise, slaughter, and cook animals, and eating meat has always func- tioned as a metaphor for social processes, whether subservience to the gods or declaration of social status. Meat eating, for carni- vores, is a sign of eating life, a symbol (tempered in the ancient world by animal sacrifices) of strength, privilege, and power. If the cooked is the social, then the raw is the natural; for vegetari- ans, eating meat is eating death, not life. Vegetarianism, then, for Tester, represents an ideology of naturalism, and, as a Marx- ist, he traces this ideology to its historical preconditions, in this</page><page sequence="12">224 SOUNDINGS Stephen Я. Webb case, urbanization. This diet could only become popular, Tester argues, as "a city-based attempt to turn away from the looseness of urban and social existence" (145). Eating animals becomes a taboo for those who, caught in the massive urbanization begin- ning in the 19th century, can only long nostalgically for a natu- ralness and harmony that never existed. Vegetarians legislate a victimless diet because they live in an urban setting without ani- mals, and thus they can afford to idealize a humanity independ- ent of animal labor. As Tester's analysis of vegetarianism demonstrates, there are complex historical factors in what must be considered a massive paradigm shift in western sensibilities: throughout the 19th cen- tury the Victorians were becoming increasingly sentimental, es- pecially about dogs and horses. Keith Thomas, in Man and the Natural World,25 also maps the shift from domination to kindness and compassion as a result of decreasing contact with work and farm animals. Simply put, as our dependence on animals de- creased, the moral treatment of animals increased. Animals as toys replaced animals as tools. Although pets were not uncom- mon in the middle ages, they were for the most part the play- things of courtiers and members of the privileged religious orders. Working dogs were ubiquitous in the Renaissance, but pet dogs remained an upper-class phenomenon, especially con- nected to women. In early modern England, the distinction be- tween work and pet dogs became crucial. Thomas argues that all the features of present-day pet keeping were in place by 1700. "It was not these necessary animals," Thomas explains, "but the un- necessary ones, hounds and lapdogs, which received the real af- fection and the highest status" (102). Unlike Tester, Thomas does not see this trend in purely Marx- ist terms.24 He finds in the practice of pet keeping a new kind of morality that would have enormous consequences: "There is no doubt that it was the observation of household pets which but- tressed the claims for animal intelligence and character" (101). Ritvo has suggested that the increasing practice of keeping pets is connected to a réévaluation of the softer, so-called feminine emotions, what an earlier age would call, and perhaps we still call, emotional indulgences.</page><page sequence="13">A Theology for the Dogs 225 Otherness as Excess Pets are excessive, both in terms of the demands they make upon us and the attention we give them. The question remains: can that excess change the way we think and act toward animals? Does that excess have a value that is more than sociological and psychological? Probably the most important feature of pet keep- ing is that pets are not overtly functional: they are correlated, then, with a rise in luxury, in disposable income. They are em- blematic of what Thorstein Veblen calls conspicuous consump- tion,25 a commodity with purely symbolic value, disconnected from exchange and therefore emptied of any referential content. Although pets are bought and sold, in an important sense they reside outside of the economic order. They are more gift than property. Thomas argues that it is precisely their uselessness that made pet keeping morally significant. Pet keeping encouraged the middle class to form optimistic conclusions about animal intelligence; it gave rise to innumerable anecdotes about animal sagacity; it stimulated the notion that animals could have character and individual personality; and it created the psychologi- cal foundation for the view that some animals at least were entitled to moral consideration. It is no coincidence that many, if not in- deed the majority, of those who wrote on behalf of animals in the eighteenth century were, like Pope or Cowper or Bentham, per- sons who had themselves formed close relationships with cats, dogs or other pets (119). Pets force, by their very excess, a recognition of an animal reality independent of the human world. They also, by the extrava- gance of the pet relationship, awaken humans to the existence of animal intelligence and sensitivity to pain. No one has more thoughtfully meditated on the ethical signifi- cance of animals, dogs in particular, than Vicki Hearne. In Adam's Task: Calling Animals by Name,26 she pushes for a return to more traditional ways of looking at animals and, in fact, her own work is in continuity with the classic stories of Old Yeller, Lassie, and Black Beauty, as well as modern animal tales like The Plague Dogs and Nop's Trials, the stories by which children were once taught the values of loyalty, trust, and friendship. Her basic argu- ment concerns the defense of anthropomorphic language: the dignity of the discourse of animal trainers, over and against behaviorists and philosophers. Animals generate "skeptical ter-</page><page sequence="14">226 SOUNDINGS Stephen H. Webb ror" in us (a phrase she adopts from Stanley Cavell), testing the limits of our knowledge and our capacity to imagine real other- ness. Training demands that we listen to the language of ani- mals, a language that is unspoken, extra-linguistic, but nonetheless communicative. Animal trainers use morally loaded language, telling stories about heroism, courage, and grace, vir- tues that now seem to be outdated and archaic. Animal stories seem to belong to a distant past, to childhoods that are now im- possible, to a naive valorization of virtues that today seem irre- deemably suspect and innocent. Yet, these are the stories that trainers use to make sense of their animals, and, speaking strictly pragmatically, they work. Indeed, you can change an animal's behavior not just by using modification techniques but also by changing the story you tell about the animal. Animals, Hearne suggests, seeem to be aware of the stories we tell about them, and they want us to tell the right stories, and they help us to tell those stories, if we let them. If we treat them like Cartesian machines, that is how they will appear to us, fulfil- ling our narrow projections; but there is an individuality, alert- ness, and intelligence that remains as a residue after we have reached the limits of behaviorism. In training animals we teach ourselves to respond to and learn from individuals who share enough of our world to be able to stretch that world further than the bonds of our language ordinarily allow. Although many animal lovers today look at training as a restrictive and imperial (hierarchical) intervention into the carefree and wild life of the animal, training is a kind of language that requests the obedi- ence of the animal only in order to expand its capacities for re- sponsibility, to enhance its awareness of the human environment in which it lives, and to encourage its desires for disciplined and thoughtful activity. The main lesson that the language of animal training teaches is the need to be responsive to otherness. For dogs, Hearne ar- gues, loyalty and meaning are interdependent. One is not possi- ble without the other. Dogs are very attentive to surface grammar; we are not so. We need deep knowledge to under- stand the very basic alertness of dogs, and when dogs do not fit into our notion of what they should be or do, we can quickly turn against them in frustration and anger. Dogs, by contrast, are very reassuring when we become skeptical about them, when we lose</page><page sequence="15">A Theobgy for the Dogs 227 our way in the negotiations with them that we ourselves initiate. We value skepticism, but they are clownish, foolish, excessive in their desire to please and cooperate. They are very forgiving. "Dogs," says Hearn, "are in general more skilled at belief than we are" (60). Animals come to us with their own beauty and dignity, and they plead for our patience and understanding. In return they give us more than we could otherwise have known about ourselves, by allowing us to venture a relationship that goes fur- ther, because of its very awkwardnesses and limitations, than the boundaries of human language normally permit. "The fact that animals are so generous in answering us is what makes it not only okay to train them but a human duty, one way we enact our grati- tude to the universe that animals exist" (265). What Hearne is looking for is a new kind of language within which we can frame our understanding of animals, a language to which the animals themselves would contribute. She relies on the language of dog trainers, but she also encourages a réévalua- tion of literature, of story telling as a way of getting at animal otherness. For Hearne, animal stories should have a moral point, a lesson about the limits to kindness and the need to disci- pline our knowledge through the practice of attention and the following of rules. Animal stories certainly can illustrate moral lessons or rules; to the extent that they merely exemplify a gen- eral principle, however, they risk reducing the animal in the story to a means to some extrinsic end. The story about the animal becomes a story that is really about us; in other words, it is a story that could be told in some other way, about something else, but still with the same point or message. By contrast, there is another kind of story which is often told about dog-human relationships in which the excessive nature of mutual devotion is itself the theme of the plot. This is the kind of story that dog lovers tell every day, and admittedly such stories can border on the sentimental and idiosyncratic. Nevertheless, by relating the intensity of our commitments - by publicizing the domain of the private - animals can be inserted into the world of human affairs with a passion that is hard to deny or contain. In fact, dog stories, if they are true to their subject, can- not be anything but extravagant; otherwise, their form would be- tray their content.</page><page sequence="16">228 SOUNDINGS Stephen H. Webb The stories we tell about the animals we love are not always simplistic and commonplace. Although this popular genre is marginalized by literary critics and connoisseurs alike, the best examples show that in the divulgence of excessive attachments something powerful can be revealed. These stories are not fanta- sies, even though they often appear to be fantastic in their range of emotion and concern. Take Virginia Woolf 's Flush, for exam- ple, the story of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's cocker spaniel, but also the story of Woolf 's own dog. Woolf was afraid that the book would be praised, and condemned, for being "charming, delicate, ladylike."27 The work does occasionally assume the dog's perspective through thick descriptions of both the blur of sensations and the distinctive smells and sounds of the dog's life, but it succeeds in avoiding triviality by keeping a certain distance between the human and the animal world. "The fact was that they could not communicate with words, and it was a fact that led undoubtedly to much misunderstanding. Yet did it not lead also to a peculiar intimacy?" (37). Note also the most direct portrait of the dog lover's love, J. R. Ackerley's My Dog Tulip, which pushes the human-animal identi- fication almost as close as it can (respectably) go.28 The book manages to be a story about a love affair in which the intensity and intimacy of the human-dog relationship does not appear as transgression or "bestiality." It mixes careful observation ("Dogs read the world through their noses and write their history in urine" [43].), appropriate humor ("No matter how preoccupied her mind may be with other things, such as rabbitting, she will always turn back, before following me, to the place where she saw me relieve myself - for nothing that I do escapes her - to sprinkle her own drops upon mine. So I feel that if ever there were differences between us they are washed out now. I feel a proper dog" [55].), grateful admiration ("She had, after all, ful- filled a dog's most urgent need, she had managed to bestow her heart, and upon steady people whose dull, uneventful lives re- quired the consolation of what she had to give" [125].), confes- sions of dismay ("The look in hers disconcerts me, it contains too much, more than any beast may give, something too clear and too near, too entire, too dignified and direct, a steadier look than my own. I avert my face. Raising a paw, she bangs me on the knee" [138].), sober sympathy ("I realized clearly, perhaps</page><page sequence="17">A Theobgy for the Dogs 229 for the first time, what strained and anxious lives dogs must lead, so emotionally involved in the world of men, whose affections they strive endlessly to secure, whose authority they are expected unquestioningly to obey, and whose mind they never can do more than imperfectly reach and comprehend" [158].), and ulti- mate acquiescence to a bond that connects regardless of limita- tions and differences ("I listen, but I cannot act. How can I put her from me?" [139]). It is the combination of humour and curi- osity here that enables Ackerley to speak with such revealing pas- sion without appearing too eccentric and ridiculous. Indeed, the best of these stories show that self-indulgence need not turn into narcissism, nor does passion necessarily slip into sentimentalism. In a discussion of William James, Jacques Barzun writes, "Sentimentality is no excess of anything; it is a de- ficiency of the imagination that should lead to action."29 Senti- mentalism, in its pejorative sense, betrays an indefensible gap between suffering and sympathy. Sentiment in a positive sense, the particularity of passion, if it is born from a generous imagina- tion, can only spread outwards, encompassing the other and transforming the self. The best dog and animal stories are the ones that embrace the oddness, the exuberance, the poetry of the pet-human-animal relation that conceptuality itself cannot achieve. If the difference between humans and animals, once it is articulated and conceptualized, always distorts an otherness that cannot be put into words, because those words are all too human, then to understand otherness we need stories that cap- ture something beyond the conceptual realm. We need stories that show what ordinarily cannot be said. The problem is that animals are other, but we can only point to their difference; their real difference is always even more dif- ferent than we imagine, more other, that is, than the word differ- ence can convey. It is a difference that is both distant and intimate, drawing us out of ourselves and toward that which we can never fully know. What I am after here is what Midgley iden- tified as something pointless. Indeed, what we need is a notion of excess, or hyperbole. Excess is a different difference, a more than that reaches outward across the space where concepts and ideas fail. Difference that is dependent on the logic of analogy sees the other as more of the same, giving us less than otherness, a difference whose similarity is always greater than its difference,</page><page sequence="18">230 SOUNDINGS Stephen H. Webb while the (il) logic of hyperbole constitutes a better otherness than difference alone, by imagining the other as much more than more of the same and yet similar enough to be sayable, in the form of stories about passion and care. Excess as More than Other Most nonbehaviorist talk about dogs is condemned as anthro- pomorphism, and anthropomorphism is, in turn, often simply equated with exaggeration. Anthropomorphism was a term first used in theology, meaning the act of attributing human traits to God. Theologians argue, mostly, that this is not an error, but an inescapable limitation whereby we conceive of God as analogous to something we understand about ourselves. As long as we realize the limitations of this language, we can claim to have knowledge that is more than a mirror reflection. Later, "anthro- pomorphism" (with all of its difficulties) got applied to animals. Can we have more than anthropomorphic knowledge of ani- mals? Can we learn to read from them more than what we read into them? Is our projection of human terms onto the dog world an attempt to create them in our own image, or is it a donative act that tries to respond to the gratuitous with gratitude? Dogs are by definition deformed: they have been bred, changed, their features exaggerated. They are the most plastic of animals (as opposed to cats) ; cats relieve you of the burden of intervention, manipulation, invention. The shape of the cat, for example, cannot be changed much through breeding. As Camille Paglia notes in her comments about cats and ancient Egypt, cats are geometrical; they have a sense of their own ele- gance and design.30 Dogs, on the other hand, are more amor- phous; they are, to a certain extent, what we have made of them, for various ingenious purposes. They are the product of human attempts to exaggerate nature, to stretch it out of shape, to remold and reinvent. But the transfigured shapes of dogs are, at their best, more like exaggerations than deformities, that is, they are distortions that make sense.31 The body of the dog, then, is the shape of the figure of hyperbole, the material incarnation of that figure of speech, extending outward in extravagant ways but nonetheless retaining the integrity of an organic whole, of shape. The dog is a figure for a figure, but the dog is also an embodi- ment of the figure of excess in a more meaningful way. The dog</page><page sequence="19">A Theology for the Dogs 231 is always more than we know, extending beyond our knowledge, and calling on us to match its excess with acts of generosity of our own. The gift that the dog is has not always been adequately re- turned. Indeed, in such a close relationship there is enormous risk. Familiarity and intimacy bring great danger in the forms of resistance and denial. Ritvo tells the story, for example, of the English fascination with and horror of rabies, which resulted in the early modern period in outbreaks of dog massacres. This usually occured during the so-called dog days of summer, origi- nally named after Sirius, the dog star, but also connected to these regular and ritualized killings. Ritvo suggests that the disease of rabies had more symbolic than real meaning: "At issue was con- trol over the rhetorical arena in which the meaning of both the animals and the disease was defined" (171). The dogs most fre- quently targeted were strays, mongrels, and the dogs of the lower classes. Such killings involved the whole society: "The rhetoric of purity and contamination structured the discussions both of science and bureaucratic rationalizers and of their most ignorant and panic-stricken charges. Rabid dogs were viewed as not only dangerous, but also unclean; their disease was a kind of pollu- tion" (174). These slaughters show how deeply ambivalent peo- ple can be about otherness, especially when that otherness is so near and close.32 The nearness of dogs - their being close at hand, in the sense of Heidegger's zuhanden - can also force them to function, of course, as a mere extension of the human ego. Much of the psy- chological literature on dogs, for example, treats them as diver- sions from the real world that might provide indirect health benefits but hardly deserve attention as ends in themselves. As James Turner remarks, The pet encapsulates the virtues of the heart, unsullied by skeptical calculating intellect" (76). By the very purity of their devotion pets can provide an avenue of es- cape from the harsh realities of everyday life. When dogs and other pets are magnifications of the human ego, though, they risk losing any meaning in themselves, and thus they are treated as excessive in the sense of irrelevant and wasteful.33 Indeed, there is a lesson here about rhetoric. Bad hyperboles give us a hyperreality that is disconnected to reality, a symbolic level of meaning that can be manipulated, entered into, enjoyed,</page><page sequence="20">232 SOUNDINGS Stephen H. Webb but which leaves us unchanged, unaffected, which leaves us alone. Good hyperboles take us further than we could otherwise have gone, and do not return us to the same place. Of course dogs can be the mere repository of our surplus feelings, of all that is alienated during the work day, those emotions that could be channeled into social change or into bettering human rela- tions. But good dogs, like good hyperboles, do more than this; they offer us more than we could ever find within, they take us further than we knew we could go, they make us more than our- selves. As Turner's statement itself suggests, dogs are like a gift, a grace undeserved, that releases us into an economy of abun- dance, where the economic laws of scarcity and therefore compe- tition no longer apply, where instead we feel ourselves the beneficiaries of a wealth that is actualized only as we give it away, and in giving we see something that we could not see before. In this way, dogs are part of the anti-economy of gift giving, of gen- erosity, of grace. There is revolutionary potential, then, for the relationship of humans and dogs to embody, more than anything, not necessar- ily consolation but the joy of lavishing and squandering, of exper- iencing the useless, the non-necessary, the wasteful, the hyperbolic. If utilitarianism is too dependent on calculation to be a guide to human-animal relationships, and rights theory is entangled in questions about the connection of responsibility to mutual agreement or contractuality, then we require a fresh start on the issue of the ethical treatment of animals. We owe animals charity, I say, not justice; this charity is in complete opposition to the kind of economic thinking that treats animals as products to be processed efficiently in factory farms and laboratories. It is a giving that is mutual, a response to a real otherness, the return of a gift of loyalty and affection. Charity is born from its own kind of covenant, even if it is not the explicitly negotiated agreement that provides the contractual foundation for justice. The gift of the human-dog relationship - and it is irrelevant whether we look at this relationship as initiated by humans or by dogs; it is a mutual relationship - has its own dynamic, which circulates in ever widening circles, and if we follow it, passing it on and giving it over and over again, we will see it unfold as a bounty of generosity that can never be limited to dogs alone. In this relationship there are clues to understanding how we can</page><page sequence="21">A Theology for the Dogs 233 approach the world as both an inevitable extension of our own plans and projects and as something unpredictably and surpris- ingly valuable in itself. Nature is, for ill or good, becoming in- creasingly domesticated and decreasingly wild; far from idealizing a natural world that has no connection with human intentions, we must learn to deal with a world that is more and more dependent on us for its very survival. As Harriet Ritvo notes, "The concept of pet is not inevitably limited by species; pets do not even have to share our domiciles. Pets can also be understood as animals to which we maintain a certain relation- ship of domination mixed with responsibility and generosity. So defined, pets may prove to be nearly ubiquitous."34 Skeptics will demur, cynically creating dilemmas, crises and slippery slopes in which concern for animals meets impossible implications or raises unfortunate consequences. All moral impulses lead us into difficult situations. We can only trust the passion that carries us and follow the gift that has already been given. NOTES 1. This essay is dedicated to the late Eric Dean, Professor of Religion and Phi- losophy at Wabash College, who once told me (and I never had the oppor- tunity to tell him that I too had this desire) that he had always wanted to write a theology about dogs. I do not know what he had in mind, but I hope I got the spirit of it right. This essay is also, of course, for my dachs- hund Marie, whose own praxis of giving - she insisted on sitting on my lap during much of the writing - is daunting and relentless. 2.

There is a third classic argument, based on environmental concerns, but this position subordinates the problem of animals to the more general question of humanity's relationship to nature as a whole. Animal species, not individual animals, become the subject of concern; every species plays an integral role in the complex network of relations that establish an ecosystem, and for the preservation of ecosystems, therefore, species must be protected. In the modern revival of the animal rights movement under the leadership of Singer and Regan, there is little sympathy for this way of approaching the issue. 4. Spinoza connects compassion for animals to "empty superstition and wo- manish tenderness" (Ethics, Pt. IV, Prop. 37, note 1).

"This book is not about pets," Singer smugly asserts.

My criticism of Singer is influenced by Josephine Donovan, "Animal Rights and Feminist Theory," Signs 15 (1990): 350-75. Also see Regan's defense of his hyperrationality in "The Case for Animal Rights," In Defense of Animals, ed. Peter Singer (New York: Harper 8c Row, 1985), 25-6. 6. As one feminist put it, "The emotional force of kinship or closeness to an- other is a crucial element in thinking about moral deliberations. To ignore the reality of this influence in favor of some abstraction such as absolute equality may be not only impossible, but undesirable" (Lori Gruen, "Dis- mantling Oppression: Ecofeminism: Women, Animals, Nature, ed. Greta Gaard [Philadelphia: Temple U P, 1993] 79). 7. For a survey of Christian attitudes toward animals see Andrew Linzey and Tom Regan, eds., Animals and Christianity (New York: Crossroad, 1988), and Charles Pinches and Jay B. McDaniel, eds., Good News for Animals? (Maryknoll, New York: Orbis, 1993). For a constructive approach to these issues, see the excellent work by Andrew Linzey, Christianity and the Eights of Animals (London: SPCK, 1987). The Jewish approach to animals is both more complicated and more promising than Christian attitudes. It is inter- esting, for example, that the laws concerning the proper treatment of ani- mals in the Hebrew scriptures are focused on domesticated animals (working animals, not pets: the dog, admittedly, is spoken of in the He- brew Bible only in negative terms, and the cat is not mentioned at all). These laws (the Sabbath rest, for example, is extended to working animals) imply that a relationship of mutual dependence necessitates obligations and responsibilities on the part of the human partner toward the animal. See Roberta Kalechofsky, ed., Judaism and Animal Rights: Classical and Con- temporary Responses (Marblehead, MA: Micah Publications, 1992). 8. Barth is thus committed to an anthropocentric view of the universe. He affirms the gifted character of the world only when it is construed as a gift for us on the basis of God's giving in Jesus Christ. "That God's creation has the character of benefit derives everywhere, as we have seen, from the fact that its fundamental purpose lies in the covenant between God and man" (Church Dogmatics III/l, ed. G. W. Bromiley and T. F. Torrance [Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1958]) 332. For a critique of Barth's anthropocentrism that does not deal with the question of animals, see James Gustafson, Ethics from a Theocentrk Perspective, 2 vols.

"Only analogically can we bring [animal life] under the concept of respect for life If we try to bring animal and vegetable life too close to human, or even class them together, we can hardly avoid the danger of regarding and treating human life, even when we really want to help, from the aspect of the animal and vegetable, and therefore in a way which is not really apposite" (Church Dogmatics III/4, 350).

If metaphysics is the search for ultimate certainty, order, and stability, a search that, at least since Descartes, has focused on the human as the source and criterion of all value, then the culinary expression of metaphys- ics is the carnivorous diet, the way in which meat must be at the center of every meal, representing the substance or essence of eating. The very word 'meat,' after all, is synonymous with essence. Consuming animals (the old- est violence) quite literally reduces the other to the same, with meat serving as the first principle, the condition for the possibility of consumption itself. In this context, a vegetarian diet would be the willingness to eat without order or structure, freed from the desire to center the meal on the appro- priation of otherness. 15. Indeed, her entire idea about a poinuess object that nevertheless exercises human faculties is drawn from Kant's aesthetics. Looking at art as the realm of free play, which liberates reason from the demands of explanation and understanding, is a longstanding paradigm within aesthetics. Sigmund Freud said it well: "Beauty has no obvious use; nor is there any clear cul- tural necessity for it. Yet civilization could not do without it" (Civilization and Its Discontents, trans. James Strachey [New York: Norton, 1961] 29). 16. Mary Midriey, Animals and Why They Matter (Athens: U of Georgia P, 1983) . 17.

Harriet Ritvo, The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victo- rian Age (Cambridge: Harvard U P, 1987). Note that Ritvo does not see medieval animal trials in a purely Durkheimian perspective: "As animals were released from the burden of guilt for witchcraft, homicide, sodomy, and other crimes, a sense of independence and power that had been im- plicit in the ability to intentionally transgress was also withdrawn" (2). Also see James Turner, Reckoning With the Beast (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1980). He argues that blood sports were criminalized because they did not fit into lifestyle patterns demanded by industrialization. Since the conclu- sion of blood sports "depended on the endurance of the animals, they could go on for hours and could not be ended at the stroke of the clock. Since they went hand in hand with gambling and drinking, they promoted prodigality instead of thrift, irregularity instead of sobriety and orderliness" (25). 20. Coral Lansbury, The Old Brown Dog: Women, Workers, and Vivisection in Ed- wardian England (Madison: U of Wisconsin P, 1985): "At this time [late nineteenth century England] popular opinion held that the workers were inherently deficient in all feelings of compassion towards animals because they were so like animals themselves. Therefore it was the duty of all en- lightened people to train and discipline them as though they were dogs that had never known a collar or a command" (39). Moreover: "The belief that compassion for animals was a manifestation of sexual frustration was long held to be a medical fact, and like a great many other convictions of similar bias it lacked both logic and sense" (83) . "Women saw themselves as horses being flogged and beaten, and many saw their own condition hide- ously and accurately embodied in the figure of an animal bound to a table by straps with the vivisector's knife at work on its flesh" (84) .</page><page sequence="24">236 SOUNDINGS Stephen H.

Adams, The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical The- ory (New York: Continuum, 1990). It is interesting that one of the first writers since ancient times to clearly defend the intelligence of animals was a woman, Margaret Cavendish, whose essays in the 1650s and 1660s con- nected meat cooking with military battles. It is also interesting that Thomas Taylor connected women's and animal rights, arguing that if women are given rights then even animals will eventually receive them. His A Vindica- tion of the Eights of Brutes (1792), which draws heavily from Porphyry's De abstinentia, is an ironic reply to Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Women. 23.

For a leftist and functionalist critique of pet-keeping similar to Tester's see the fascinating essay by Marc Shell, "The Family Pet," Representations 15 (Summer, 1986): 121-53. Shell at once marginalizes and magnifies pet keeping practices: "Pethood is itself a relatively kindly and unthreatening institution" (142). Nevertheless, by representing an idealized interconnec- tion of kin and kind, pets inhibit reflection on the cross-cultural inter- human reality. "In this way pethood helps to conceal even from would-be kindly human beings the brutally inhumane reality of the doctrine of uni- versal (human) brotherhood" (142). Those influenced by Marx tradition- ally are not sympathetic to attempts to re-enchant humanity's relationship to nature and animals. For Marx, one of the few good things that capital- ism accomplished was the end of the deification of nature. See David Mc- Lellan, trans, and ed., The Grundrisse (New York: Harper, 1971) 94-5. 25. Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (New York: Penguin Books, 1979). The dog is the closest thing the middle and lower classes can come to having a servant: "The dog has advantages in the way of uselessness as well as special gifts of temperament .... He is the filthiest of the domestic animals in his person and the nastiest in his habits. For this he makes up in a servile, fawning attitude towards his master, and a readiness to inflict dam- age and discomfort on all else. The dog, then, commends himself to our favour by affording play to our propensity for mastery, and as he is also an item of expense, and commonly serves no industrial purpose, he holds a well-assured place in men's regard as a thing of good repute" (141). Veb- len can make such charges only from the perspective of a totalizing utilita- rian perspective; in his ideal society, only the useful would be true. His indictment of 'surplus value' ironically perpetuates the most distinctive traits of capitalism. 26. Vicki Hearne, Adam's Task: Calling Animals by Name (New York: Knopf, 1986). 27.

I do not mean to say that all dog breeds are healthy and right; some dogs have suffered much due to unwarranted distortions of their physical fea- tures. Nevertheless, breeding demonstrates not so much intervention but the intermingling of human hopes and desires with the world of the dog. 32. Dogs were persecuted because their closeness to humans allowed them to function as scapegoats; as James Turner notes, "Cruelty implies a desire to inflict pain and thus presupposes an empathetic appreciation of the suffer- ing of the object of cruelty" (2). 33. Indeed, I am not defending here the pet industry, which frequently mar- kets pets as easy supplements to the rigor of daily life, with the result that pets are often used and abused (frequently through abandonment), con- tributing significantly to animal suffering in this country. 34.
