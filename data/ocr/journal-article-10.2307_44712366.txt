<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAELMAS TERM, 1926. FIFTH MEETING. At a meeting held in the Combination Room of Christ's College on 28 October 1926, Dr R. B. Onians read a paper1 on " Egypt, Colchis, the Aethio- pians and the Garden of Eden, Circe and Smintheus." On August 10th, Sir W. Flinders Petrie announced to the British Association that he had discovered in the region of the Caucasus all the place-names of the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead. Independently of this, I would here draw attention to a series of problems presented by various hitherto uncorrelated Greek and oriental traditions and suggest that the solution of some, if not all, may lie in the one-time existence in this same quarter, strange as it may seem, of a people in appearance and culture akin to the Egyptians. Met separately, each tradition might be, and, in the apparent absence of any basis in fact, has been, dismissed as inaccuracy, fantasy or myth. Of varying weight, the points may be roughly enumerated. (1) The much-travelled Herodotus, after visiting both lands, says unequivocally of the people inhabiting that region in his day : " The people of Colchis are evidently Egyptians. I speak having observed it myself before hearing it from others.... They alone work flax in the same manner as the Egyptians and the two peoples are like one another in their whole mode of life and in their language" (n, 104 f.). He points by the way to the dark complexion and curly hair which they share (/xcXcty^pocç Kal oiXá- i-piXís)- (2) Pindar before him, in outlining the Argo legend, speaks of the Colchians as K€Xan/a&gt;7r€ç ( Ryth . iv, 212). (3) Homer speaks of Aethiopians living in the extreme east at the sunrise. The point furthest east known to the Homeric Greeks was in fact this eastern shore of the Euxine from which to the approaching Argonauts and their successors the dawn and 1 The paper will probably be published elsewhere in full and with all references. 1-12</page><page sequence="2">24 Dr R. B. Onians the sun seemed to rise. Homer also indicates that his Aethiopians lay to the east of Asia Minor, for, returning from their sacrifices, Poseidon passes over the mountains of the Solymi1, a people somewhere to the north of Lycia. So too from its other elements - the Amazons and the isle of Leuce - the Aethiopis appears to have been concerned with the Euxine world. As, however, their eastern horizon and the sunrise receded, the later Greeks looked for oí, ¿7 rò 7]'lov àvaroXiaìv or oí airo r¡'iov A lÔiWcç first around Susa and then on the Indian ocean. It is because these last regions are far beyond the limits not only of possible alliance for Troy but also of the world known to Homer that his Aethiopians have been dismissed as mythical. The epic tradition spoke of them as a historical people sending help to Troy and intermarrying with its royal house. (4) For Homer, also, not only are the Aethiopians «rxaroi d vSpœv, where the sun rises, but the land of sunrise is defined (Od. xii. 3 f.) as Circe's home, Aiaia, the more usual Aia. So too for him on Aiaia are the oUia of Eos, and to Tithonus, from whose couch she daily rises, Eos bore Memnon, king of the Aethiopians. Aia was for the Greeks, as far back as can be known, e.g. for the eighth-century poet Eumelus, identical with Colchis. Mimnermus, also, writing in the seventh century, apparently identifies Aia with the land of the Aethiopians as the land whence rise the sun-god and the dawn-goddess Eos. (5) With no apparent realisation of these facts and no other conceivable excuse except that he was following the Aethiopis or some similar source, Dictys Cretensis says explicitly that Memnon led his Aethiopians from the Caucasus. (6) The hawks associated with Memnon were, as might be expected, reputed to come to Troy from the land of the Aethio- pians (Pliny, X, 37) but came in fact from the direction of Parium and Cyzicus (Aelian, N. A. v, 1), i.e. of Colchis. (7) No one ever thinks of Circe as other than of Greek form and complexion, but two very différent early vases (black-figured) show Odysseus as a normal Greek and Circe with figure, features and hair unmistakably negroid, though hitherto unrecognised as such because no reason was known for such a representation (see Walters ,J.H S. 1892-3, pp.77 ff., Fig. 2and PI. iv; cp. inf. p. 27, n. 2). (8) The Gorgons lie east of Colchis, and Perseus returning thence (and presumably at the same time from his visit to the Hyperboreans in roughly the same quarter) comes to the Aethio- pians, also called Cepheni, under Cepheus the father of Andromeda. Pliny speaks of Cepheni on the borders of Armenia, but consider- ably inland. It was, however, to a monster from the sea that 1 The exact position of this people is not known. After reviewing the later localisations from Herodotus onwards, Gutschmid concludes that all are merely conjecturing from Homer. For the Orphic Argonautica the Solymi are on the Euxine coast near Sinope.</page><page sequence="3">Egypt, Colchis, the Aethiopiam, etc. 25 Andromeda was exposed and her half-brother or wooer was Phineus, king of Salmydessus on the Euxine. In fact in Colchis to-day, ancient "fish" idols of stone, Višape, are preserved with the legend of the monster thus named coming out of the Euxine and being destroyed by the hero (now Christianised into St George). (9) The Genesis account of the Garden of Eden has hitherto been unintelligible for lack of a Kush = klOio-iria (lxx) in this quarter near the virtually united sources of the Tigris (Hiddekel) and Euphrates. The 4&gt;€iow may perhaps be explained by the Phasis, not however by the distant stream commonly so-called, but by that which the Ten Thousand found thus named just here, the Pasin or the Lycus where its source virtually joins those of the Araxes (Persian Dschêhun , Arabic G'aihûn er-Râs) and Euphrates. This gives the four arms of the river of Eden. There remains to be explained "Khawila, where there is gold." The Lycus passes Kd/3aA.a, the only mention of which by a Greek writer also pro- claims the fame of its gold (Strabo xi, 14, 9). For W = f or ß, see Ramsay, Hist. Geoy. of Asia Minor , 22 and 312. (10) By Ai0io7Tia here the lxx render Kush. Kash, Kush and, ac- cording to Delitzsch, Kish was the name by which the Egjqptians (and with them the Israelites) knew their neighbours and kin of the upper Nile whom we, after the later Greeks, call Aethiopians. This native name in fact occurs in the Hittite and Assyrian records as the name of a state or states on the eastern frontier of the Hittite empire, Kash and Kissia (1 cf. Kissuadni). As KiWioi it still clung to the population of southern Colchis till the time of Ptolemy (v, 6, 6). It appears to be preserved by the Greek tradition that Andromeda's mother was named Kao-c-icVcia and Memnon's mother Kicro-ia1, perhaps the ethnic name of the mortal princess, bride of Trojan Tithonus and incarnation of the dawn- goddess. (11) The accuracy with which the Greeks applied the name AtÖiWcs seems to be witnessed by the fact that they applied it not only to the dwellers in the Nile valley and to those whom we seem to find to the east of the Euxine but also2 to the people dwelling around Susa, whose native name recorded by Herodotus serves as confirmation. It was Klo-ctlol and that of the region Kioma which has been connected with the once dominant city Kish. In Babylonia Genesis also (x, 8ff.) recognises a branch of Kush. The striking similarity of the early civilisation of the Nile valley to that of early Elam and Babylonia has long been recog- nised, but Pharmakowski and Rostovtzeff on examining the prehistoric art of the Kuban valley (Colchis) and looking for 1 Perhaps also in the name of Circe's daughter Ka&lt;r&lt;ri.&lt;f&gt;6i&gt;r}. K laaLa may not have been applied to Memnon's mother till after his location at Susa, and chance coincidence is of course possible here as at other points in the above. 2 In applying the term to a people near the Indian Ocean Herodotus is careful to note that they differed in physical appearance and language from those of Africa.</page><page sequence="4">26 Dr R. B. Omans parallels can find them only in that of these last-named regions at Hieraconpolis, Susa, Kish, etc. In the absence of the evidence given above, they have to assume coincidence of artistic tendencies despite difference of race. (12) The story of Circe passes unexplained as marchen or myth. Attempts are made to relate K ipKrj to KcpKtç, KpoK-q , etc. Its natural meaning "sparrow-hawk," though put forward (e.g. by Dr A. B. Cook), has met with little acceptance for lack of corre- lative evidence. We may compare the similarly descriptive name Kvk'wi1/. Bérard perceived also that Circe's other name Aiairj, like A «77-175 the name of her brother, has for its base Ala, which (Ai' a) is the Hebrew or Phoenician word meaning just this " sparrow-hawk, falcon." He could however only suggest that AlcLLrj , as regarded from a place further west, lay in the direction of the sun which the Egyptians conceived as a sparrow-hawk. Why the Egyptian conception should appear at all he could not say, and he too sought to identify the place so named with Circeii in Italy1. But Circe from Homer onwards was sister of Aietes, the king of Aia (Colchis) and the klpkcllov irzhiov there, and Homer expressly places her in the extreme east. The Semitic names (cf. § 14) are what we should expect. It was from Phoenician predecessors that Greek pioneers in the Eux ine would obtain their first information concerning the names of places and rulers. Indeed the legend preserves the fact. With this information the half- Phoenician Phineus rewarded the Argonauts. This goddess Kipnij = Aiairj and her brother Abfrrçç, the reigning king of the land, thus appear in some way to have been conceived as hawks. Their father was "HAaoç and the goddess was represented in art with radiate head while the king had solar regalia. Now the chief cult of the earliest dynastic Egyptians was that of the sparrow-hawk deity Horus who as far back as his meaning can be traced was solar and it was uniquely with this solar sparrow-hawk deity that the earliest kings were identified. The king was "the Horus who is in the palace " or simply " the sparrow-hawk " and represented as such. (Cf. however, also the Hittite kingship below and the Mermnadae). (13) Almost the only other fact known about Memnon king of the eastern Aethiopians is that he was in some way identified with a hawk2. A hawk (Mc/xroi/oç opviç, sometimes multiplied as Mcp,iw€ç or feminine M €/¿1/01/18 eç) was reputed to have risen from his ashes or to have bewailed hirn. Polygnotus (Paus, x, 31, 6) represented him with such birds upon his cloak. (14) With the negroid Circe on the vases is shown a hog as in Homer's story. The victims of the Colchian sparrow-hawk deity are hogs. In Egypt the outstanding feat of the sparrow-hawk 1 So too A. J. Reinach and after him Picard, though seeing her relation to the Ephesian and Hittite goddess. 2 To the fact that Memnon was associated with hawks my attention was first drawn by Mr Gow in the discussion following the paper.</page><page sequence="5">Egypt, Colchis, the Aethiopians, etc. 27 deity is the triumph over the hog or wart-hog Set. But Horus is male and Circe is still a mystery. Neighbouring Colchis was the Hittite empire of which also the king was identified with and officially addressed as "the Sun." Above the hieroglyphics of his name appears the sun-bird aptly compared to the winged-disk of Horus. Texts, monuments and seal cylinders show that the Hittites worshipped Zarnama (libaba), the hawk-sun-god of Kish, and a hawk-goddess, the great solar goddess but also goddess of the earth and fertility, identified by name with Babylonian Astarte, one popular variant of whom in her solar aspect was in fact named Aia. At Ephesus whose Hittite cultural antecedents are proved, excavations have revealed numbers of hawk-images in the sanctuary of the fertility goddess worshipped as Artemis and anthropomorphic representations of the goddess winged1. This Artemis could be described as K ¿pkyj and she, as is the hawk (contrast the dove, swan, quail), is irórvia Orjpúiv, attended by lions and wolves, worshipped as /ca7rpoc£áyoç, and described as T€p7rofjL¿vY1 K¿irpoi(Tiv etc. At Ephesus as elsewhere, she, like Circe, appears to have had a park of relatively tame wild animals. But she was worshipped as Kolvkolo-ls and the Euxine was recognised as her home (vid. e.g. Paus, iii, 16, 7 f.). The winged Artemis Orthia was reputed to have been brought from Tauri whither Colchis was conceived as extending. In art there she was repre- sented winged and the sixth-century silver mirror from Kelermes in the Kuban valley shows her thus with lions, boars, etc. In a separate compartment we appear to find above a boar, a hawk, the only bird represented. In the art of the eastern Euxine in the classical period this goddess is supreme. Her other characteristic there is not less remarkable or significant for us. She is commonly represented offering a cup to a man. She was known there by the name Astara, clearly that found among the Hittites, that of the great Babylonian goddess Aštar or Ištar ( = Aia) who was goddess of the morning-star and morning-light or dawn. But Ištar behaved exactly as did Circe. She had many lovers, she offered them refreshment and turned them into brutes. Thus in the sixth book of the Gilgamish epic she desires the hero but he tells her how she tempted thus Išullanu, offering him food, "Thou smotest him, didst turn him into a hog2" (cf. her hog-consort Adonis 'Ewoç). Their records show that the epic was familiar to the Hittites and to the Harri further east. Here doubtless is the origin not only of Circe but also of the Queen Lab of the Arabian Nights whose name means "sun," who assumes bird-form, who makes every 1 This conception may perhaps also explain the strange form of the cult image at Ephesus, and the many-breasted "eagle-lady" of Zakro (usually dismissed as fantasy) whose head in some of the sealings is not "aniconic " or "perverted," as currently described, but covered by a falcon's hood. 2 This translates the text as emended by Jensen and adopted by Langdon. It should be noted that the Ištar, who behaves thus, is placed in Elam, the home of the Aidioires = Klaaioi, and that her consort then appears to be Ninib, who was conceived as a hog. The Greeks, if they knew this setting, seem to have recognised it in Colchis.</page><page sequence="6">28 Mr J. T. Sheppard stranger her lover and, giving him enchanted food, turns him into an animal for her park. The only obvious solar goddess of the Greeks was the dawn-goddess Eos, winged mother of the hawk Memnon. It does not appear to have been observed that Homer describes Aiaia as containing her oUía Kal x°P0Ł' and elsewhere makes it plain that the only dwelling there visible was that of the hawk-goddess K 1/9*17, daughter of the sun-god, and her nymphs. In myth Eos was notorious for her ravishing of mortal lovers, Tithonus, Orion, Cephalus, etc. The Euxine goddess as we have seen was recognised by the later Greeks as Artemis, who of clear hawk-form at Ephesus is also the rival or substitute of Eos in the loves of Orion and Cephalus. We have now perhaps the reason why Artemis was worshipped as irpoa-qda, 'Aómç, &lt;£a&gt;o-&lt;£ópoç, and if we remember the racial evidence given for the eastern Euxine, the negroid Circe and Eos queen-mother of the Aethiopians, we can perhaps at last explain1 why Artemis alone among Greek deities was called AWioiria, kiOoirCa , why on the phiale in the hand of the winged Trórvia Orjpwv statue at Rhamnus Pheidias represented Aethiopians and no other race, and why ultimately on a late silver patera from Lampsacus Artemis was represented as of black skin with a sparrow-hawk at her side ( Gazette A rchêologique , 1877, Pl. 19). Of the two other survivals of hawk cult in Greek tradition of which I am aware, we may note that one, the hawk Daedalion, is son of cEwc r&lt;£o'/ooç, Aurora, and that the other is &lt;È&gt;ot ßos 'AkoWcm, whose original hawk-form continued to be suggested by the hawk placed upon the head of his anthropomorphic statues (Aristoph. Birds , 516). Homer describes him descending from Ida 1/977*1 éoiKítís ( Il . xv, 237) and as having his representative (a yyeÀoç) in the particular kind of íépa£ discussed, the sparrow-hawk, *1/9*05 {Od. xv, 526). The hawk Artemis was coupled with him at Ephesus. It does not appear to have been observed that it is the god conceived thus, at the relevant time and place, on the Asia Minor coast in Homer's day, who was 'Hp.ivOzvs. Here - since the sparrow-hawk eats mice - rather than in a connection with plague or a mouse-totem, lies I would suggest the explanation of that name, a name which, according to the scholiast and the representation at Chryse, meant "destroyer of mice." Similarly in Egypt shrew- mice were associated with the cult of the sparrow-hawk Horus.</page></plain_text>
