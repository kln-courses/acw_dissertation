VII OCTOBER 1916 No. 12 REPRESENTATION IN ART In our recently discovered New World of poetry, the Spectrists come and the Vorticists go, but the Imagists, during at least a decade, have shown a certain vitality and staying power. Just now, when modernist schools of painting and sculpture are specializing in the various ways of escape from representation in art, it is worthy of note that a vigorous modern school of poetry has given itself a name, which, if it means anything at all, would show that the so-called "free verse" is not plotting this sort of escape. Evidently the emancipation sought by the Imagists is not that which will deliver them forever from representation and its works. Indeed, the best of the Imagist verse, such as that by Miss Lowell, Fletcher and Masters, is often particularly strong in vivid delinea tion-a fact commended to the notice of those modernist painters and sculptors who are trying to renounce representation, because they are weary of it as of a tale too often told. The modernist poet abhors vagueness of thought, seeks exactness of word, and glories in what he calls his " externality." The modernist sculptor, on the contrary, piques himself upon creating "form which is not the form of anything." Representation in art is as old as the hills and promises to be as permanent. This is by no means to say that -we shall defend it at its worst and weakest, or praise it in its most commonplace and least imaginative forms. "'Tain't hard work," mused the New England studio-boy, picking over, bit by bit, the studio clay after it had suffered the process of plaster-casting. "but it's awful busy work!"" Uninspired representation of unsubjugated detail in art could meet no better description. The camera and its products have only con firmed us in our growing dissatisfaction with mere dull copying in art-the kind of trans scription which, like clay-sorting, "ain't hard work, but awful busy work." Often it would seem that the camera itself pos sesses more imaginative power than the human copyist. The will to represent was with the men of the old stone age, as is proved by the images of animals graven on the walls of the caves in Southern France. In later ages his native need of images had joined with his anthropomorphism to put a snare in his way of religion; the first Mosaic law is but one of many warnings against bowing down unto likenesses. So natural to man is his joy in the recognition of things, and so real his delight in making things which will win recognition, that even when representation in art or craft has been for bidden to him by his religion's law, resem blances, more or less conventional, will issue from the depths of his subconscious ness and creep unasked into his decoration. The eye of the beholder if not of the fash ioner will detect far-off fruit and flower forms in the Mahometan arabesques. Before human nature can escape from repre sentation in art, it must first escape from the will to represent. That would appear to be no easy matter, either for the cave man or for the Futurist.</page></plain_text>
