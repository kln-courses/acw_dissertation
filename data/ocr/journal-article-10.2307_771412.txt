Yet the fact that there is in the Standing Woman of 1930-1934 a disturbing quality which is absent from the Standing Woman of 1912- 1927, may be taken to justify La- chaise's own belief that the earlier sculpture was both the kernel and the summation of his work. For the present, let it be so. N E W DOCUMENTATION ON THE LARGE BUDDHA IN THE LONDON EXHI- BITION Editor's Note: We are happy to publish the following note from Dr. Siren concerning his article in the February issue of PARNASSUS: My report of the inscription on the pedestal of the large marble Buddha in the London Exhibition was not quite correct owing to the fact that it was taken from a document given to me in Peking in 1922, written by the Chinese Assistant of the owner of the sculpture, who evidently had not taken proper care in copying the in- scription correctly. Since then I have had occasion to see not only a rubbing of this inscription, but also the origi- nal sales-document drawn up in 1918, when the statue was sold to M. Culty. On the ground of these documents the following corrections can be of- fered: The inscription is at present not quite complete, because the upper right corner of the pedestal has been knocked off and the front has been rubbed, but its main contents are quite clear and interesting in so far as they give the date and the name of the place for which the statue was made. Although the three first characters are completely missing and a portion of the fourth, there can be little doubt that the beginning of the inscription should be read as follows: "In the Great Sui dynasty, K'ai Huang's reign, the fifth year, cyclically called i-ssu third month, eighteenth day, for the Ch'ing-kuang temple in Han-ts'ui vil- lage, through, the co6peration of eighty men, this image in white jade (stone) of Mi-to (Amitabha) was made together with two Bodhisattva statues." The interpolation of the four first characters as Great Sui, K'ai Huang, is justified by the fact that the only fifth year which was called i-ssu (approximately about this period) was the fifth year of K'ai Huang's reign; the statue could not for stylistic reasons be sixty years earlier or sixty years later than 585. According to the sales-document, the statue stood in the Hsiang-pei village in Wan-hsien of the district of Pao-ting Fu. It was sold in order to obtain means for the erection of a village-school. It was further agreed that it should be transported to the Fang-shun Chiao station south of Pao- ting Fu at the responsibility of the sellers, and from here it was trans- ported by train to Peking. It may be added, that when the statue arrived in the capital and was pulled from the station through the Chien-men, the convoy was stopped by the police, because it was said to be too heavy for the streets. M. Culty had to sign a promise to have all the damage to the streets repaired in case such should occur. Nevertheless the statue has since then traveled widely over two continents! Feb. 24, 1936.
