In spite of the great variety of themes and plot constructions, the variations of genre conventions, the differ- ences in point of view, the simulation of quite different locations, times, events, and characters, there are some characteristics of Nabokovian worldmaking that may serve as a key to the implied worldview and philosophy of life. In this paper, I concentrate on what I hold to be perhaps the most telling one: the competition between pattern-making and the regime of chance that governs Nabokov's writing, from the intricacies of style to the construction of feigned lives and the imag- ining of whole fictional worlds. Because all his novels are styled as either fictitious biographies or autobiographies, it is no wonder that coincidence appears in the guise of individual fates, as the intervention of a mysterious agency playfully called "McFate." What is marvellous, however, is the way in which Nabokov again and again succeeds in turning a series of highly contingent events into an intimation of a hidden plan that may even suggest a guiding superior power. This at least is the reader's impression; and sometimes even the fictional characters concerned come to suspect more than sheer arbitrariness behind the baffling coincidences. When I try to analyse my own cravings, motives, actions and so forth, I surrender to a sort of retrospective imagination which feeds the analytic faculty with boundless alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork and re-fork without end in the maddening- ly complex prospect of my past. I am convinced, however, that in a certain magic and fateful way Lolita began with Annabel.1 If, near the beginning of his autobiography, Humbert Humbert thus tries to blame fate for his perverse obsession with young girls, he feels responsible enough at the end for his cruel treatment of Lolita to deserve "at least thirty-five years for rape."2 And if he seems not to be sure whether his life is determined by fate or his own doing, how are we as readers to know whether or not life is predetermined in the world he lives in? As a character in one of Nabokov's novels, the twists and turns of his life are, of course, predetermined by the author's plotting, and conse- quently Nabokov was held responsible for his life story in the moral uproar that was raised after the publication of Lolita. Within the ensuing fray, which was essentially about the relationship between ethics and aesthetics, Nabokov criticism was bent on demonstrating the superior quality of the book as a work of art, and the author's subsequent novels Pale Fire 1 Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita (1955; London: Transworld Publishers, 1969) 15-16. 2 Nabokov, Lolita 325.</page><page sequence="2">336 Herbert Grabes and Ada did much to support his view that "a work of fiction exists only in so far as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss."3 Critics devoted their at- tention to the intricate patterns and the host of sly allusions hidden in his individ- ual works, and generally refrained from attempts to demonstrate that there are philosophical and even metaphysical issues involved. Too intimidating was the ef- fect of Nabokov's scathing remarks such as: "There exist few things more tedious than a discussion of general ideas inflicted by author or reader upon a work of fic- tion,"4 or ". . . what some call Literature of Ideas . . . very often is topical trash,"5 and he later included among his "strong opinions" that only a philistine can har- bor the delusion that a "book, to be great, must deal in great ideas."6 In the last two decades, however- above all through Vladimir Alexandrov's 1991 monograph on Nabokov's Otherworlcf-ã growing interest has developed in Nabokov's "metaphysics," even if by no means everybody would take at face val- ue (as Alexandrov does) Véra Nabokov's remark that "potustoronnost" ("the be- yond") was the "main theme" of everything her late husband wrote. Against this background, it is tempting to give some attention to what Nelson Goodman has aptly termed "worldmaking," the specific features of the fictional worlds we en- counter (or rather are persuaded to construct) in reading Nabokov's novels, and above all those that may imply metaphysical notions. Far from being able to give an even provisional account of all such features, I will concentrate on the role of fate in his novels, because that hopefully will reveal with how much certainty we can deduce a particular metaphysical stance from his art. Before we look at the pertinent evidence to be found in Nabokov's novels, it may be helpful to muster the principal options regarding the role of fate in human life and especially the respective metaphysical assumptions and mundane conse- quences involved. The notion of 'fate' firstly implies the assumption or acknowl- edgment that as human beings we are not fully masters of our destiny, that we have not been able to choose the time, place, and particular circumstances of our birth and a large part of what determines our further course of life. If we abstain from any metaphysical assumptions, a reflection on this state of affairs will lead us to a recognition of the reign of mere chance in terms of Heidegger's "Geworfen- heit ins Dasein," of being thrown into existence, and depending on our situation and temperament we may interpret this fact pessimistically as being more or less determined, in Taine's terms, by race, milieu, moment, or with a moderate opti- mism as we find it, for instance, in Rorty's postmodern belief in contingency that leaves considerable room for self-determination. 3 Nabokov, "On a Book Entitled Lolita?

Thus, the course of our life appears to be already fixed, and depending on whether the agen- cy is held to be a benevolent God, some frivolous gods, or even some sinister tran- scendental power, the consequences are existential feelings of security, of insecu- rity or of deep frustration. A problem arising from all these assumptions is, of course, how to deal with the experience of human agency, of a free will as it occurs especially in decision-mak- ing, and a great variety of solutions have been devised which either aim at expos- ing free will as a pure illusion or as a rather insignificant factor at least. And the illusion is usually explained by the further assumption that the dictates of fate are concealed from us, and can at best be glimpsed in retrospective. Nevertheless, such a view will engender a constant search for clues, for a key that might open the doors to the corridors of the future or at least may let us see life as meaningful by discerning some pattern in the memories of our past. A more serious problem accrues from all fatidic views of human existence, how- ever, regarding an acceptable solution to the question of morality. If one considers human life as being predetermined or determined by an agency of fate, and free will an illusion, we cannot be held responsible for our decisions and actions. For this reason, the most widely held worldviews are less radical in their enthrone- ment of fate and leave some room for human agency, and thus for human respon- sibility. Within a metaphysical framework, such a solution is achieved by assuming either that the transcendental agency still grants us some scope in the formation of our lives or that two antagonistic powers (such as God and Satan, for instance) aim at determining our fate and we can gain some influence within the fray. These introductory remarks about philosophical and religious concepts of fate hopefully will have opened a vista on the complexity of the matter, and I will now turn to the novelistic work in question. First, however, a pertinent reminder in view of recent Nabokov criticism: all I say pertains only to Nabokov's artificial worldmaking, and I am neither sufficiently competent nor willing to speculate about the worldview of Nabokov the man. What can be risked in advance is the statement that in almost all of Nabokov's novels the plot or tangle of plots contains such a tension between the reign of co- incidence and plan in the lives of the fictional characters that the reader- and of- ten enough these characters themselves- are led to ruminate over the role of fate. To enforce such a speculation, Nabokov has almost no qualms about inventing the most unlikely coincidences just in order to let these later appear as particularly sly machinations of fate to impress some significant pattern on the characters' lives or to give these lives at least a meaningful turn. In order to substantiate and exemplify this tenet, I will present a selection of in- stances from the various novels which, within the scope of this brief article, can be but scanty and no more than an invitation to cooperate and add any number of further examples from the reader's own memory. In Nabokov's first novel Mary, the future life of its central character Ganin is determined by the most unlikely co-</page><page sequence="4">338 Herbert Grabes incidence that Mary, a girl he loved nine years ago, is now married to, of all people, one of his acquaintances among the several hundred thousand Russian emigrants that live in Berlin, and that this acquaintance Alfyorov tells him about her im- pending arrival and shows him a photograph of her so that Ganin can discover that she is his former love. For on account of this discovery Ganin attempts to make the past become alive again and to scheme to win Mary back- until he real- izes in the carrying out of his scheme that his love affair with Mary has ended for- ever, that he is free of the past and ready for a different future. In King, Queen, Knave, what saves Dreyer from being murdered by his schem- ing wife Martha is the chance remark that he expects to add a hundred thousand dollars to his fortune the following day, for Martha is greedy enough to postpone the planned murder- not knowing that this decision proves fatal for herself be- cause her unsuspecting husband is thus still able to take her to the seaside, where she catches a severe cold and suddenly dies of pneumonia. Julian W. Connolly has drawn attention to the fact that in this and other novels by Nabokov 'fate' is "as- sociated . . . with the design of the extradiegetic author." He deciphers the allu- sions contained in the narrator's commentary on the described feat of fate that "[t]hat little trip to Pomerania Bay was in fact proving to be quite a boon for eve- rybody concerned, including the god of chance (Cazelty or Sluch, or whatever his name was), once you imagined that god in the role of a novelist or a playwright, as Goldemar had in his most famous work,"8 and he comes to the conclusion that "Nabokov signals to the reader here that 'fate' or 'chance' are the agents of the authorial consciousness that has crafted this fictional world."9 He further elabo- rates on the role of the inventor as an agent of fate and- just as his antagonist En- richt- of higher forces, starting from the narrator's explicit commentary on the coincidence that the inventor, when coming to Berlin, stays in the same hotel room the prospective murderer Franz had lodged in on his first arrival: "It is sig- nificant that Fate should have lodged him there of all places. It was a road that Franz had travelled- and all at once Fate remembered and sent in pursuit this practically nameless man who of course knew nothing of his important assign- ment, and never found out anything about it."10 Regarding Nabokov's next novel, The Defense, Vladimir Alexandrov has dem- onstrated how "seemingly chance events in Luzhin's life suggest that an other- wordly fate operates in it."11 Details like the fact that Luzhin has the opportunity to watch two classmates playing chess right after he has for the first time been shown how the pieces move, and that he soon after finds in an old man the right partner to develop and test his own ability; that the prompt arrival of a former ac- quaintance of his wife keeps her from pursuing her intention to keep him away from chess after his nervous collapse; and that he discovers the pocket chess set that had been missing for several months in the lining of his jacket exactly when it was essential for his adherence to the game, appear as chance occurrences when 8 Nabokov, King, Queen, Knave (1928; New York: Vintage International, 1989) 224. 9 "King, Queen, Knave," The Garland Companion 203-14; 210. 10 Nabokov, King, Queen, Knave 107-108. 11 "The Defense," The Garland Companion 75-88; 78.</page><page sequence="5">Nabokov's Worldmaking: The Marvellous Machinations of McFate 339 they are first encountered by the reader, yet retrospectively turn out to be impor- tant links in a chain of events that serves to keep Luzhin's life so closely attached to chess that only "chess life" is "real life" for him. And there is an amazing amount of patterns of this sort in the novel, patterns that emerge, however, gener- ally only in retrospect, and when a character like Luzhin is given some insight into his future, there is no way to escape the determined fate- not even by a desper- ately self-willed act like suicide.12 The determinist view of the life of a fictional character also becomes apparent when- as in Glory- the hero is presented as "that rarity- a person whose 'dreams come true,'"13 yet though it is a well-known game to interpret dreams as premonitions, it is only for very astute readers like Pekka Tammi, for instance, to discover in retrospect the hidden links between Martin's dreams and later inci- dents in his life.14 And though Martin is granted prefiguring dreams and an occa- sional intimation of some mysterious agency determining his life, he is barred the comprehensive insight only the author and reader of his life story possess or gain. What becomes apparent in the linking of novelistic dreams and "reality" is, above all, the controlling power the author possesses over his creation, a demonstration of the god-like authorial power that we also find in the profuse framing imagery of Laughter in the Dark, for instance,15 or in the "fine net of traps, tricks, and other devices all designed to ensnare the hero and destroy his smug illusions"16 in De- spair. In the latter novel, however, Nabokov has allowed his creation Hermann to not only gain insight into his dependent position as a character in somebody else's novel but also to persistently rebel against it. And this rebellion against being scripted by somebody else even extends to the notion of God as the creator: There is yet another reason why I cannot, nor wish to, believe in God: the fairy tale about him is not really mine, it belongs to strangers, to all men There are, however, no grounds for anxiety: God does not exist, as neither does our hereafter, that second bogey being as easily disposed of as the first.17 Nevertheless the narrator, and finally the author Nabokov, use Hermann's own tale for the construction of his novel and thus demonstrates his superior position. At least within the domain of fiction, there is no escaping fate in terms of authorial power, no scope for self-determination of the created. In a similar rebellion against existential dependence, Cincinnatus in Invitation to a Beheading turns against his authorial creator once he has become aware that he owes his existence not to a transcendent being but to a mortal writer, yet at least this author is benign enough to grant him a fictional version of that immor- tality, the belief in which had formerly helped him to cope with his cruel physical fate. 12 See "The Defense?

And on top of the fact that this insight into the ingenious synchronizing of two lives proves to Fyodor the lover that he and Zina were meant for each other, it also gives to Fyodor the writer the "chess idea" for a novel that in regard to the workings of fate will be similar, a novel in which these workings will also be hidden behind a host of deceptions and will therefore- as Zina believes- make him a writer as has never existed before. This strategy to hide life's pattern behind seeming coincidences and thus create riddles to be solved by the reader, a strategy clearly visible in Nabokov's Russian novels, subsequently became even more sophisticated. The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, his first novel written in English, is teeming with absurd coincidences, co- incidences that seem to thwart the biographer's task at least as much as they help him and yet let his work be successful against all odds. The most amazing ploy is most probably how Nabokov makes a conceited and bungling biographer succeed exactly by failing to perform his task. Trusting his unwarranted belief that in his soul he is identical with Sebastian, he turns Sebastian's "life" into an autobio- graphical account of his own search for it, and the resulting parody of a biography is indeed a mirror of Sebastian's "real life" as a writer because parody was his par- amount genre. What is most remarkable in Bend Sinister regarding the role of fate is the unfor- tunate hero's being suspended between a total subjection to the cruel whims of chance (just think of the fact that the dictator Paduk happens to be a former schoolmate of Krug, whom Krug used to bully) and the commiserating stance of the narrator who mercifully lets him go mad to spare him the awareness of his fate and even stops the story "before another and better bullet hit him."18 The narrator is aware of the fact that "the immortality . . . conferred on the poor fellow was a slippery sophism, a play upon words,"19 but Nabokov in his "Introduction" to the novel expressly states his compliance with the intruding narrator as an "anthropo- morphic deity impersonated by me." And he confirms that [i]n the last chapter of the book this deity experiences a pang of pity for his creature and hastens to take over. Krug, in a sudden moonburst of madness, understands that he is in good hands: nothing on earth really matters, there is nothing to fear, and death is but a question of style, a mere literary device, a musical resolution.20 At least in this respect the realm of art proves to be a better world than the one we live in. As I stated earlier, in Lolita the multiple employments of fate by the autobio- graphical narrator do not imply that he can finally absolve himself from being re- sponsible for his doings. His skeptical attitude towards such an instance is not only 18 Nabokov, Bend Sinister (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1964) 200. 19 Nabokov, Bend Sinister 200. 20 Nabokov, Bend Sinister 11.</page><page sequence="7">Nabokov's Worldmaking: The Marvellous Machinations of McFate 341 signaled by his occasional jocular addressing of it as "McFate" but even more by calling "precise fate" a "synchronizing phantom" exactly when the coming togeth- er of so many coincidental factors in the fatal accident of Charlotte Haze seems so spectacular that he may well assume that a hidden agency may have been at work. Humbert Humbert is too intelligent to overlook that "fate" is but a phantom, a figment of the imagination that serves to causally explain even the unexplainable because we are not content to rest with contingency. And just as much as he is ready to "surrender to a sort of retrospective imagina- tion" in order to find some significant pattern in the course of his life, to a search based on the conviction "that in a certain magic and fateful way Lolita began with Annabel,"21 readers and critics22 have used their retrospective imagination to first discover and then explain the meaning of the long-range strings that tie together into patterns the various instances of optical reflection or of the appearance of a squirrel in Pnin- thus corresponding to an authorial strategy revealed in that nov- el by Joan Clements when she says at Pnin's party: "But don't you think- haw- that what he is trying to do- haw- in practically all his novels- haw- is- haw- to express the fantastic recurrence of certain situations?"23 In Pale Fire, this strategy becomes apparent to the point of self-parody because such fantastic recurrences not only are profusely inserted into the life stories of Shade, Kingbote/Botkin and King Charles of Zembla but also a host of motifs from one of these stories reappears in the other two. In this way, this novel becomes a veritable feast of coincidences, emulating the "combinational delight"24 John Shade sees in his art and believes some transcendent powers who play the "game of worlds"25 must have found in the "plexed artistry" of his life: "Yes, it sufficed that I in life would find / Some kind of link-and-bobolink, some kind / Of correlated pat- tern in the game, / Plexed artistry, and something of the same / Pleasure in it as they who played it found."26 While in his canto on I. PH., "Institute (I) of Preparation (P) / For the Hereafter (H), or If, as we / Called it -big if!"27 he had previously rid- iculed all anthropomorphic visions of the beyond, he thus grants the artist a meta- physical insight via a likening of the "game of worlds" to the "game of words." If Pale Fire is thus an invitation to a quasi-divine "combinational delight," Ada is a celebration of "individual, perceptual time"28 in terms of memory as a "photo- studio de luxe," full of images of the past. In the synchronicity of this studio, these images "sit still"29 and can therefore form marvellous patterns, which abound in 21 Nabokov, Lolita 16. 22 First, Julia Bader in Crystal Land: Artifice in Nabokov's English Novels (Berkeley: U of Cal- ifornia P, 1972) 82-94; and later, quite extensively, Gennady Barabtarlo in "Риш," The Garland Companion 599-608. 23 Nabokov, Pnin (1957; New York: Vintage International, 1989) 159. 24 "Pale Fire," 1. 973, Nabokov, Pale Fire (1962; London: Transworld Publishers, 1966) 73. 25 "Pale Fire," 1. 819, Pale Fire 67. 26 "Pale Fire," 11. 811-15, Pale Fire 67. 27 "Pale Fire," 11. 503-505, Pale Fire 55. 28 Nabokov, Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle (1969; New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969) 536.

Yet if such patterning might en- courage speculations about a supernatural agency, if the influence of chance events on Van's, Ada's, and Lucette's lives and the entanglement of these lives should appear too significant to be the result of sheer contingency, we are remind- ed that the only power determining Van's and Ada's fate is the author of the nov- el. "They took a great many precautions- all absolutely useless, for nothing can change the end (written and filed away) of the present chapter"30- we read that at the beginning of the tenth chapter of Part Two, in which Demon detects their in- cestuous love affair and enforces their long separation. In Transparent Things, the agency of fate appears in the shape of ghosts of the deceased, above all of the "author" of the tale, Mr. R.; yet, as Barton Johnson has pointed out, their power is limited. Their advantage is that for them the past of ev- ery person or thing has become transparent and that thus they can observe signif- icant patterns in that past- patterns like the motifs of fire, of avalanches, falling and asphyxiation as the reader can find them in this novel. Their influence on the living is likewise limited. What they are able to do is "to act as a breath of wind and to apply the lightest, the most indirect pressure such as trying to induce a dream that we hope our favorite will recall as prophetic if a likely event does actu- ally happen." And they are particularly helpless concerning the determination of the future because individual human life is not "a chain of predeterminate links" but "a hit and miss" affair.31 The involuted pattern of authorship in this novel lends some probability to the assumption that the pattern retrospectively found in life must have some author just as those in a novel, but this is the most we can pos- sibly know. In Look at the Harlequins, the initials of the title, LATH, already point at the web, the patterns retrospectively found in life by an autobiographical writer. These patterns in this case, however, turn out to be the constructions of a mad- man, who deliberately sets out to deliver a proper account not of his life but just of his "illnesses, marriages, and literary life."32 What he suspects behind those pat- terns and the twists and turns of his past life is the activity of an inept main plotter who not only knew nothing of its real object but insisted on making inept moves that seemed to preclude the slightest possibility of success. Yet out of those very mistakes he unwittingly wove a web, in which a set of reciprocal blunders on my part caused me to get involved and fulfill the destiny that was the only aim of the plot.33 Thus it is no wonder that he is confident that "Coincidence is a pimp and a card- sharper in ordinary fiction but a marvelous artist in the patterns of fact recollected by a non-ordinary memoirist," especially since he has always been possessed by a déja-vu feeling, a "sense of recurrence." This culminates in the suspicion that his life was but 30 Nabokov, Ada 432. 31 Nabokov, Transparent Things (1972; New York: Vintage International, 1989) 92. 32 Nabokov, Look at the Harlequins (1974; New York: McGraw-Hill, 1974) 27. 33 Nabokov, Look at the Harlequins 3</page><page sequence="9">Nabokov's Worldmaking: The Marvellous Machinations of McFate 343 the non-identical twin, an inferior variant of another man's life, somewhere on this or an- other earth. A demon, I felt, was forcing me to impersonate that other man, that other writer who was and would always be incomparably greater, healthier, and crueler than your obedient servant.34 Of course, this is madness, but only if we exclude the fact that Look at the Harle- quins is, among other things, quite obviously the parody of an autobiography of Nabokov as a writer,35 and thus mad Vadim has been granted some imperfect knowledge about his true ontological state. What can we deduce from this brief reminder of pertinent authorial strategies in Nabokov's novels regarding the role of fate? I trust my examples have already made clear that there is no universal answer. First, there is more than ample evidence for the view that even if life is not neces- sarily a work of art, art may well be a key to understanding one's life. Just like the reader of Nabokov's novels we may retrospectively detect how seeming coinci- dences turn out to be important elements of larger patterns contrived by the au- thor, and how such patterns become visible in strings of significant recurrences. And we may therefore be led to extend this correspondence to surmising that such patterning as we also discover in our lives may just as well be the work of some all- controlling agency or author. At least someone like John Shade, who is himself an author, may say: "I feel I understand / Existence, or at least a minute part / Of my existence, only through my art."36 Yet regarding the stance of that agency toward us humans, the life stories we find in Nabokov's novels give us no clear answer: the metaphysical author may be a benign God, an indifferent fate, or some sinister plotter who seems to be much crueler than the narrator at the end of Bend Sinister. Thus we may discover with some relief that from Nabokov's novels we can gath- er just as much evidence that there is such a rift between the realms of life and art that those who mistake the one for the other only turn their lives into tragedy or end up in madness. And it may well be that we welcome the controlling hand of the artist together with Ada, just because it provides "a frame ... a form, some- thing supporting and guarding life, otherwise unprovidenced on Desdemonia, where artists are the only gods."37 To sum up the evidence, at least his novels leave us quite uncertain about Nabokov's view of the possible existence and probable nature of a metaphysical agency called "fate" or God or gods or otherwise. What we can observe is a con- stant reflection on the relationship between the author as creator and his creation, especially the lives of his fictional characters. This metafictional reflection be- longs, however, quite clearly to the domain of art, and, in view of the evidence I have supplied, it seems to me that we are well advised to let it remain right there. 34 Nabokov, Look at the Harlequins 89. 35 See Herbert Grabes, "The Deconstruction of Autobiography: Look at the Harlequins!," Cyc- nos 10.1 (1993): 151-58. 36 Nabokov, "Pale Fire," 11. 970-72, Pale Fire 73. 37 Nabokov, Ada 521.</page></plain_text>
