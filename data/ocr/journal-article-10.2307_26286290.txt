<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIRGINIA WOOLF SCHOLARSHIP A SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY FROM 1991 TO 2003: Justine Dymond I am indebted to James R. Kelly of the W. E. B. Du Bo is Library at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who generously gave of his time and knowledge in database research and to Louis A. Faassen whose expertise and guidance smoothed the process of this under taking. NOTE: This bibliography is a supplement to the one prepared by Laura Sue Fuderer, which appeared in the Virginia Woolf special is sue of Modern Fiction Studies in 1992 (38.1), which in turn supple mented that by Barbara Weiser in the Woolf special issue of 1972 (18.3), which in turn supplemented that by Maurice Beebe in the Woolf special issue of 1956 (2.1). Preliminary searches produced more than 3,000 citations referring to Woolf (not including dissertations) and thus necessitated restrictions for inclusion in this bibliography. Dissertations, book reviews, articles less than five pages in length, and individual conference papers are among those works excluded from the bibliography. The bibliography is organized as follows: 1.
