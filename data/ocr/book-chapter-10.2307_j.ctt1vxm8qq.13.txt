These represent radically different and   opposed ways of relating to pebbles. In the burnt mound we see their rit-  ual destruction, while in the pebble sculptures we witness their curation,  selection and arrangement into patterns representing people or objects  in the Bronze Age world in relation to mortuary rites taking place near to  large summit pebble cairns of Early to Middle Bronze Age date.  Jacob’s Well  Jacob’s Well is situated at the foot of the western escarpment of the East  Devon Pebblebed heathlands (SY 0250 8546). It is the site of a spring, a  water pool and bog marked in prehistoric times by a large mound of fire-   cracked pebbles. The site was excavated by George Carter during 1938/ 9.  In his archive there are numerous photographs, a plan and line drawing  of the mound, a plan of his excavation trench and some reconstruction  diagrams. He did not write up the results of the excavations, presumably  because they were undertaken just before the outbreak of the Second  World War. The mound still exists today, cut through by Carter’s excava- tion trench that he did not back fill. It is situated in a mature pine plantation  on flat land 50 m to the east of the B3180 road below the summit of Black  Hill, one of the highest points on the Pebblebed heathlands. Immediately  to the east, the land rises steeply up the scarp slope, limiting views in this  direction to a few hundred metres. To the northeast, Woodbury Castle  190 </page> <page sequence="2"> 19 is visible on the horizon some 2 km distant. To the northwest, there are  extensive views to the Raddon Hills. To the west and southwest, there are  fine views across the Exe estuary to the Haldon Hills, with the high peaks  of Dartmoor just visible beyond. The ground around the mound is still  very boggy today, especially to the south, and the nearby road is still wet   with the spring water even during dry periods (Figure 6.1).   Figure 6.1 The location of Jacob’s Well just below the western scarp of  the heathlands (Source: author) Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 191 </page> <page sequence="3"> 192 193  Carter’s excavations    The mound, as planned by Carter, is a somewhat irregular oval with  a west–e ast long axis of up to 23 m and a north– south short axis of  up to 13 m. The mound is approximately 1.8 m maximum height. The  profile is markedly asymmetrical, being considerably higher on the  northern side, with what may be an extension on the southern side  (Figure 6.2.)  Carter’s section drawing shows a ditch at the eastern end of the  mound. The north, south and western sides were surrounded by what he  marks as a pebble ‘pavement’, which was about 2 m wide. In his section  drawing (unfortunately without a scale) he distinguishes three main lay- ers as follows: 1 [uppermost] A thick layer of fire cracked pebbles about 1.2 m thick.  This contained much charcoal. Samples sent by Carter to Kew ‘from  within but on the outer edge of the mound’ were identified as being of  alder (Alnus glutinosa L.) 2 An approximately 0.3-m - thick layer of peat. In a letter addressed to the  Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, dated 18 August 1939,  Carter writes ‘the peat stratum was about one foot thick. Just below    the surface was a thin layer, very extensive, of well- preserved wood,      Figure 6.2 Carter’s watercolour plan of Jacob’s Well showing his  excavation trench (Source: Carter archive) 192 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="4"> 193 or what appears to be wood. One large piece has an area of about  two square feet, and was penetrated, when the mound was built, by a   hole, square in plan, with two sides measuring 18′′ in length. The sur- face of this exposure is gently corrugated with even ripples. If this was  the bark of a tree peeled off, it would have to be a large tree to give the  area now visible. It may represent the only portion of a large recum- bent log which has not decayed. It may represent, say, thin objects  like a shield or two of bark .... The large portion is being preserved in  situ pending this examination.’ Smaller pieces were identified at Kew  Gardens as probably being oak. 3 A 0.3- m- thick pebble floor overlying a ‘raft’ of pebbles on the sur- face of the bog. This bottom layer Carter also describes as being ‘a  great mattress of pebbles allowing water to percolate freely under the  mound’ (handwritten note) (Figure 6.3). Carter excavated one trench which was about 12 m long and 2  m wide. This extended north from the southern edge, cutting through  the centre of the mound (Figure 6.4 and Figure 6.5). Beyond the paved  mound perimeter he discovered a geometric arrangement of pebbles  that he interpreted as resembling somewhat a human face. Just to the  north of this was an unburnt area of clay. This was approximately rect-  angular in shape and measured 90 cm × 1 m. On it he recovered a  large unusually shaped and flaked pebble. It is 15 cm long and parts  of the water-w orn and smooth external surface of the pebble occur  on its bottom and on a small area of the flaked top. The pebble had  been struck to remove the flakes at the pointed end. All surfaces are    Figure 6.3 Carter’s section drawing of Jacob’s Well (Source: Carter  archive) Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 193 </page> <page sequence="5"> 194   Figure 6.4 Plan of Carter’s trench through Jacob’s Well based on his  drawings and notes (Source: author) 194 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="6"> 195   Figure 6.5 Carter’s photograph of his trench through the mound  looking north.

It may have been used as a hammer stone for flaking other peb- bles, which would, as these are quartzites, produce distinctive orange  sparks. Because of its find context, Carter interpreted it as an ‘idol’  or magic stone. It was found together with much charcoal and three  pebble flakes, with distinctive white quartz veins, all from the same  pebble (Figure 6.6 and Figure 6.7). The four corners of the clay area  were marked by sharpened and pointed oak stakes the basal parts of  which were preserved in the bog water (Figure 6.8). Carter refers to  this as being an altar. Under it there was a flint flake. Just over a metre  to the north of it he found the remains of what may have been a divid- ing wall or, alternatively, a small cairn of pebbles. Four metres to the  north of this structure he recovered the decaying remains of a wooden  post or pillar, originally perhaps up to 3 m long. This lay along the  north– south axis of the bottom of his trench (see Figure 6.4). Next to  it was the post hole about 0.4 m deep with wooden remains in situ.  The wood was identified as being oak, probably Quercus robur L., the  common English species (letter from Catherine Hill, then Director of  the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, dated 6 September 1939). Carter  estimated that the post was not less than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.

These  are unusual and rare quartzite blue-g rey pebbles recognized by  Carter as having symbolic significance (see discussion of blue stones  in Chapters 2, 4 and 5). At the northern end of the trench he found  a cut water channel leading away from a well or basin. The well was  about 30 cm in diameter and 30 cm in depth. It had a birch bark sur- round and was cut into peat. From it a water channel or runnel, its  centre marked by blue stones, ran away towards the northeast under  the mound. There were no other finds of flint and no pottery in the   excavation trench.  Carter’s interpretations  Carter mentions Jacob’s Well in one of his numerous unpublished man- uscripts, To Rome from the East:  A  Study in Comparative Religion. He  writes:  The mound proper was apparently the scene for centuries of cer- emonial fire (or steam) raising, since it could only have been con- structed by a gradual process involving the bringing of pebbles, the  making of a localized fire, the dowsing of the fire by water. Thus  the stones became cracked and the fine charcoal washed down into  the  crevices. The ceremonial rites were performed for so long a  period that ultimately well and altar were covered by debris – but  local residents still go here to ‘wish’. In the bottom or peat layer  were found the broken remains of a beam of wood originally about  10/ 12 feet long. Of which the purpose can only be surmised. Here  we seem to have the locale of rain- making magic, of which remark- able literary expression will be found in the Celtic tale of the Lady  of the Fountain. (undated MS: 88– 9) Carter’s reconstruction diagram of the ‘altar’ shows the four oak stakes   supporting a roofed structure over it (Figure 6.9).  Carter firmly believed that the mound was of Iron Age date, in  common with the mounds and pebble platforms that he had excavated  earlier on Woodbury and Aylesbeare Commons (Carter 1936, 1938).  Radiocarbon dating of two of the oak stakes has shown that one stake is   of Early Bronze Age date and the second is Middle Bronze Age (see dis- cussion below and Table 6.1). 198 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="10"> 19   Figure 6.9 Carter’s reconstruction diagram of the wooden shrine.

Today Jacob’s Well is forgotten and unvisited. The  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 199 </page> <page sequence="11"> 20 only person who knows and remembers the site is Mrs Priscilla Hull,  George Carter’s daughter, who took part in his excavations. On the basis of Carter’s excavation there appear to be four main  components of the shrine: (1) a spring source defined and lined by birch  bark with a runnel carrying water away; (2) an oak totem pole; (3) a  raised structure supported by four oak stakes, with offering stones, per- haps roofed; (4) geometric (?) arrangements of pebbles and blue stones.  This was covered, in the passage of time, as a result of repeated ceremo- nies at this sacred location, by a large oval mound of fire cracked pebbles   containing much alder charcoal.  The 2010 excavations  The aim of new excavations undertaken in 2010 was to measure and  document the state of the mound and cut a small section into the body of  the mound, record further information about its structure and purpose  and obtain further material for dating and environmental analysis. The  wall of Carter’s trench was cleaned and then a 1-m - square trench in the  centre of the mound on the western side of Carter’s north–s outh central  trench was excavated (see Figure 6.10 and Figure 6.11). After cleaning  the side of the trench, on the top a humic orangey-b rown layer was vis- ible and then down through the whole profile a layer of cracked pebbles  and charcoal with no obvious stratigraphy. This rested on an underlying  peat layer. Since it was apparent that there was no discernible stratigra- phy within the burnt mound deposits we decided to excavate by 10 cm  spits until reaching the basal peaty layer. One immediate question was  where Carter had deposited the spoil from his trench. This proved to be  in two places: (a) immediately outside the mound on the southern side  and (b) on top of the mound itself, thus considerably increasing its height  and altering its profile from an oval flat- topped mound to a much more   rounded shape.  The material from each 10 cm spit, including Carter’s spoil, was  excavated into buckets and weighed. It was then dry-s ieved using a 1  mm mesh and charcoal samples were taken for analysis. It was then wet-  sieved and the fire- cracked pebble fragments were weighed separately. A   2 kg random sample of the broken fire-c racked pebbles from each 10 cm  spit was individually measured (maximum length), weighed and exam- ined for the presence of the cortex (smooth outer surface of the pebble)  and this was recorded. The purpose of this was to enable us to distinguish  whether any changes in the composition of the material were apparent  200 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="12"> 201   Figure 6.10 Jacob’s Well: sketch plan of the mound and its  surroundings (Source: author) Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 201 </page> <page sequence="13"> 20   Figure 6.11 Jacob’s Well: general plan of the mound (Source: author) from the top to the bottom of the burnt mound (e.g. more or less charcoal  and sooty deposits, or whether there might be proportionally more larger  pebble fragments present at various depths through the burnt mound or  a higher or lower degree of fragmentation of the pebbles). After removing the top orangey-b rown layer (context 1), five levels  with cracked pebbles were excavated (context 2). This was the spoil from  Carter’s excavations, and in spits 5 and 6 two green glass shards, one a  neck fragment with a bullet stopper, of a type typical of the 1930s, were  found. Beneath the spoil another layer appeared similar to the top layer  (context 3). Underneath this spits 6–1 4 consisted of undisturbed cracked  pebbles and charcoal (context 4). The top of spit 6 is thus the highest level  of the original mound. The undisturbed burnt mound deposits below  were thus 90 cm in depth, overlaying the ‘peat layer’ that was 17 cm in  depth (following Carter’s description of the site) (context 5) (see Figure  6.12). Below this, large pebbles occurred in a natural grey clayey matrix.  At the junction of spit 14 and the peat layer pieces of wood started to   appear. This was collected for analysis and plotted (Figure 6.13). 202 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="14"> 203   Figure 6.12 Jacob’s Well: section (left side, back, right side) context 1: vegetation cover, topsoil – orangey- brown material with roots context 2: levels 1– 5, cracked pebbles in dark black, humic, soil,  interpreted as Carter’s spoil heap context 3: buried mound vegetation at the time of Carter’s  excavation: orangey- brown material with roots context 4: levels 6– 14, cracked pebbles in dark black, humic, plastic soil context 5: – peat level (Source: author)  We had chosen to locate our section where there were no pine trees  or tree stumps visible on the upper mound surface. However, an old and  heavily rotten pine tree stump that must have been growing on the top  of the mound in Carter’s day emerged as we excavated down through his  spoil into the underlying undisturbed deposits. The spoil had concealed  it on the mound surface. Analysis of the wood material found in the basal  peaty layer by Dana Challinor showed that it was heavily decomposed  pine root wood, the roots of the tree stump discovered in the section. No  artefact finds were recorded from the trench, and only a very few small  quartz pebbles were found intact. The rest were very highly fragmented. Within the peat horizon beneath the burnt mound three distinctive  layers could be distinguished: 3– 5 cm: light- brown peaty layer, possibly burned; 5–7  cm: an irregular sinuous black band with a distinctive smell of tar of  a kind that is usually found under charcoal kilns. During burning with  only small amounts of air, liquid tar soaks into basal layers, in our case  into the basal peat layer, and at this depth formed a distinctive band. 7– 17cm: a dark brown peaty layer (Figure 6.12). There were no artefacts in this peaty basal layer. The sequence of con- texts 4 and 5 were taken as a monolith sample and a separate sample  was taken of the tar layer (for the position of samples see Figure 6.12).

Grasses and  sedges dominated the ground (see Batchelor, Appendix 12 and discus- sion in Chapter 8).  Dating Table 6.1 gives the radiocarbon dates for Jacob’s Well. The top of the  burnt mound deposits below Carter’s spoil is dated to 1300–1 400 cal. BC  and the bottom 1400–1 500 cal. BC, so the burnt mound took approxi- mately 100 years (or three to four generations) to accumulate. The dat- ing of the oak stakes that Carter had found in the basal peaty layer under  the mound provided older but different dates. The difference between  204 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="16"> 205 the two dates can be explained by the fact that oak are long-l ived trees  and even dates from the same tree might differ. These stakes were chem- ically preserved by Carter and were analysed by Dana Challinor, who  suggests that they were of large mature trunk wood. Whether or not this  was heart wood could not be ascertained because of the nature of the  chemical impregnation. The stakes had a minimum of 30 rings. If we take the middle date of the stakes, 1620 cal. BC, as the  date for the structure Carter found in the basal peat layer there was a  100- year hiatus between the construction of the shrine in the bog and   the accumulation of the rest of the mound of fire- cracked pebbles. So  there were in all probability, though it is impossible to be definitive about  this, two main phases of human activity at Jacob’s Well: (1) an Early to  Middle Bronze Age phase in which a shrine was built on the site; (2) a  later Middle Bronze Age phase during which the pebbles were cracked   and the burnt mound deposits accumulated.  Analysis of the burnt mound deposits  The archaeological analysis of the excavated material from the 10  cm  spits shows that there is a substantial difference between Carter’s spoil  and the undisturbed burnt mound deposits beneath. In the spoil the per- centage of pebbles was considerably lower, varying between 53 per cent  and 65 per cent of the total (mean frequency 59 per cent). In the other  undisturbed spits the pebble frequency was much higher, up to 81 per  cent (mean frequency 73 per cent). The proportion of pebbles in rela- tion to ash and charcoal did not differ substantially between the 10 cm  excavation units and there was no discernible trend apparent within the  burnt mound, such as the proportion of pebbles increasing or decreasing   with depth (Table 6.2).  The total weight of pebbles from each 10 cm excavation unit was  up to 145 kg. The size of the crushed pebbles was assessed by weighing  and measuring the maximum length of the fragments in a 2 kg random  sample from each excavation unit. The vast majority of the fragments  throughout weighed 50 g or less (83– 99 per cent). In all the spits only  one or two fragments weighed more than 150 g. The percentage of  larger fragments measuring 4 cm or more in length was low in the  undisturbed spits, varying between 5 and 10 per cent. Larger frag- ments were more common in Carter’s spoil and, interestingly, in the  two basal levels of the burnt mound where they made up between 18  and 25 per cent of the pebbles. This seems to indicate that the intensity  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 205 </page> <page sequence="17"> 206  Table 6.2 Total weight of material (pebbles, soil, ash and charcoal) from 10 cm  excavation spit, total weight of pebbles from the spit and percentage of pebbles  by weight. 10 cm spit Total weight kg Pebbles kg Percentage pebbles  1 – 65.9 –   2  54.8 32.8 60  3  66.3 43.2 65  4  82.1 47.9 58  5  93.8 49.4 53  6 107.1 62.3 58  7 121.2 81.3 67  8 109.6 81.3 74  9 144.3 101.7 70 10 164.8 119.1 72 11 131.6 98.2 75 12 128.6 96.2 75 13 178.3 145.0 81 14 116.0 81.7 70  Note: Spit 1: top surface uneven so only pebbles weighed. of fire cracking of the material increased after an initial stage and then  remained more or less constant throughout the period of use of the   mound (Table 6.3).  The pebbles destroyed at Jacob’s Well were relatively small in size,  no more than 10–1 5 cm in length and originally weighing 500 g or less,   or about the same size as the majority from cairns excavated on Colaton   Raleigh Common, some 4 km distant to the northeast. The closest pos- sible source of the pebbles would be the bottom of the western escarp- ment of the Pebblebed heathlands, only a short distance from the eastern  edge of the mound, but some might have been brought from much fur- ther afield. Throughout Carter’s spoil and the undisturbed spits the number  of complete or whole pebbles was fewer than 20. These were recovered  from only a few of the 14 10-c m- deep excavation spits. This miniscule  frequency may be compared with up to 200 or more pebble fragments  from each 2 kg sample. The unbroken pebbles were all very small and  206 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="18"> 207  Table 6.3 The maximum length of the fire- cracked pebbles by excavation spit,  based on a 2 kg random sample of the pebbles from each.

Each pebble fragment from the samples was examined to see if any  of the cortex or smooth outer surface of the pebble remained. The fre- quency of the fragments on which the cortex was present varied between  38 per cent and 61 per cent (mean 48 per cent). The spits with the high- est frequencies (58 per cent and 61 per cent) occurred just above those  making up the basal level of the mound, where interestingly enough the  proportion of pebble fragments greater in length than 4 cm was consid-  erably smaller (Table 6.3 and Table 6.4). It should be noted that the presence of an area of remaining cortex  on most of the pebbles was by no means obvious and could be detected   only by close examination of each fragment. The intention was clearly   to utterly destroy the pebbles. The quartzite pebbles of the East Devon  Pebblebed heathlands are extremely hard material and difficult to frag-  ment and break. The degree of attrition of the material at Jacob’s Well   is therefore quite extraordinary. The fire-c racking process reduced the   pebbles to an irregular and jagged gravel resembling railway ballast or  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 207 </page> <page sequence="19"> 208  Table 6.4 Frequencies of whole pebbles and pebbles with some area of the  outer cortex remaining and percentage of these among the total number of  pebbles analysed per excavation unit.

In the process the pebbles became unrecog- nizable as pebbles. Not only did they lose their individual shapes and  smoothness but also their colours (Figure 6.14). The fire-c racked mater- ial is almost all a uniform dull grey colour even when washed to remove  the soot covering their surfaces and blackening them to such an extent  that they resembled pieces of charcoal. Sometimes when wet- sieving the  pebbles we initially misrecognized some very small fragments as char-  coal and vice versa.  An analysis of the narrow band of the material that we identified  as being tar in the peaty layer below the burnt mound was undertaken   by Vladimír Machovič of the University of Chemistry and Technology,  Prague. He reports that ‘the infrared spectre was measured with a  FTIR spectrometer Nicolet 7600 with DTGS detector, and ray diffrac- tion KBr.

The  tar layer in the peat under Jacob’s Well is the result of repeated actions,  the residues of fire with small amounts of air. It could not have formed as  a result of material being burnt elsewhere and then subsequently trans-  ported to the site. A notable feature of the Jacob’s Well deposits is that all  the charcoal fragments recovered were small – 1 cm or less in size – and   there was surprisingly little ash. Jiří Woitsch (Institute of Ethnology of  the Czech Academy of Sciences), a forest industries expert, commented  to us that in charcoal kilns tar layers are characteristic beneath the kiln  when used repeatedly and where there is not much permeable bedrock,  as is the case at Jacob’s Well. Tar bands are usually found under charcoal  kilns and they are formed by liquid components that soak into the ground  during the process of pyrolysis. The process was repeated over a period  of 100 years. In charcoal kilns there is almost no ash, sometimes none at   all (Jiří Woitsch, personal communication). The absence of large pieces  of charcoal at Jacob’s Well could suggest that it was collected and taken  away. One potential use for this material could have been in the smelting  of metals elsewhere. The results discussed here need to be put into context of the char- coal analysis and the results of experiments that were undertaken to  crack the pebbles by fire. According to the charcoal analysis: Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 209 </page> <page sequence="21"> 210 The fuel used in heating the fire-c racked stones from the burnt  mound deposits at Jacob’s Well was drawn from locally available  woodland, dominated by alder. A variety of other taxa were also  utilised, apparently with little change over the 100 years that the  deposits accumulated. It is suggested that charcoal, rather than  wood, for fuel may have been used but whether this was a reason- able use of resources rather depends on the purpose of the stone-   heating activity. (Challinor, Appendix 13) It is interesting to note that alder wood burns with an intense heat and  produces some of the very best charcoal; it was preferentially used in the  production of gunpowder (Gale and Cutler 2000).  Four experiments were undertaken by us burning pebbles in order  to investigate the conditions that resulted in the fire-c racked material  excavated at Jacob’s Well. In the first two we experimented with heating  quartzite pebbles in an open bonfire for one and a half hours and then  throwing them into running water. The pebbles cracked, but only into  two halves, and on some only small pieces of the external cortex broke  off. In the third experiment we heated the pebble, took it out of the fire,  laid it on a flat stone and then broke it easily into bits with another peb- ble. In the last experiment we put the pebbles on a bed of gravel to simu- late the situation in the mound. The pebble was heated and then easily  broken on the gravel bed with another pebble. In all cases we learnt that  the colour of pebbles was lost when the stones are heated for one hour or  more in an open fire. From the stratigraphy of the mound and results of the charcoal  analysis, tar band spectrometry and the fire heating experiments with  the pebbles we can make some further remarks about the possible pro- cess of the construction of the mound. Experiments showed that pebbles  could easily be broken on a bed of previously fire- cracked pebbles. From  the charcoal analysis we know that local wood was used, collected in the  vicinity of the mound. Our interpretation is that people brought pebbles  to the site and burnt them in a slow-b urning open fire with little air. After  at least one hour, because this is the minimum time needed for a pebble  to lose its colour, they might have removed the burning wood and broken  the hot pebbles with other pebbles used as hammer stones. Because of  the presence of the tar band beneath the mound it is evident that a fire  was present on the site. We have already commented on the similarity of the fire-c racked  pebbles to charcoal and this is worth conceptualizing further. The process  210 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="22"> 21  of pebble destruction can perhaps be understood as a transformative  process, turning stone into charcoal, itself the product of another trans-  formative process involving the burning of wood. Once wood is burnt  and only charcoal remains, the type of tree from which the wood came is  no longer recognizable. All charcoal looks the same, except, of course, in   the microscope of the environmental scientist. The fire rituals at Jacob’s  Well can be understood as producing an end product in which both wood  and stone became symbolically reduced to a state of sameness in which   the different qualities of both substances became erased. The fire ritu-  als consumed and transformed both wood and stone into a blackened  material resembling neither of them. The heat from the pebbles when  cooled by bog water would produce steam rising up from the mound as  a cloud of vapour, to ultimately disappear into the heavens above. Thus  substances that were solid and material (wood and stone) became ulti- mately transformed into the immaterial, an essence.  Parallels  This is one of only two or possibly three or four burnt mounds recently  recorded in Devon (Gent 2007; Hart et al. 2014: 10). The closest parallel  to the Jacob’s Well mound is the site of Burlescombe, near Tiverton, some  25 km north of the Pebblebed heathlands, where two Middle Bronze  Age burnt mounds with timber-l ined troughs and associated pits have  recently been excavated (Gent 2007). One of these was 4 m in diameter  and up to 0.3 m thick, with two layers of heat-s hattered pebbles, gravel  and charcoal. The other was 14.5 m long, 6 m wide and 1 m deep. No arte- facts were found in these mounds (Gent 2007: 37). These mounds, like  Jacob’s Well, were both associated with a spring, fire and burning, had  wooden structures and were constructed from pebbles from the Budleigh  Salterton Pebblebeds. The calibrated dates of the oak stakes found under-  neath Jacob’s Well overlap with the two dates from Burlescombe, but are  earlier. One small burnt mound at Burlescombe was dated to 1720–1 490  cal. BC to 1330–1 340 cal. BC, with an estimated 10–1 70 years of use.  The other larger mound was dated to 1530–1 380 cal. BC to 1420–1 250  cal. BC, with an estimated use of 60 years. The dates of this are approxi- mately the same as those obtained for Jacob’s Well. There are significant differences between the Jacob’s Well and the  Burlescombe mounds. The landscape locations, Burlescombe on the  western edge of a broad shallow coombe and Jacob’s Well at the foot   of a steep scarp edge, are very different. Jacob’s Well is a much larger  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 211 </page> <page sequence="23"> 21 mound than either of those at Burlescombe and seemingly associated  with a significantly larger bog and water pool. The structures Carter  recorded, apart from the possible presence of a trough, have no parallels   at Burlescombe. It is not possible to compare the fire-c racked pebbles at Jacob’s Well  with those at Burlescombe or at Hayes Farm Clyst Honiton since at nei- ther site do they seem to have been measured or analysed so one could  compare, for example, the state of attrition of the pebbles. Burnt mounds of fire-c racked stones in Britain and Ireland have  a long temporal span dating back to the Neolithic. A few are associ- ated with Beaker pottery but most radiocarbon- dated sites show that  they were formed during the Middle to Later Bronze Age. They are par- ticularly common in Scotland and southwest Wales, and Devon is on  the extreme western edge of their overall distribution (Buckley 1990).  Better excavated examples are associated with wooden troughs, as  at Burlescombe and Jacob’s Well, or stone- lined pits with the joints  sealed with clay, and sometimes small internal structures or buildings.  The association with water – small streams, springs and bogs – is nor- mal. Interpretations include the heating of stones to boil water linked  with cooking meat, but very few animal bones have been found in  these mounds. Barfield and Hodder (1987) argue instead that the cre- ation of large amounts of steam is more likely, so they may be under- stood as saunas or steam baths, perhaps like North American Indian  sweat lodges linked to acts of purification and ritual cleansing. Gent’s  functionalist interpretation suggests that the Burlescombe mounds  may have been used for some ‘form of industrial activity, such as the  production of textiles’ (Gent 2007: 43). Brown et al. suggest a simi- lar function for cleaning and dyeing wool or plant fibres and for hide  cleaning and tanning for Irish burnt mounds (Brown et al. 2016). This  seems very unlikely at Jacob’s Well. The character of the material – burnt pebbles – is unique, as is the  extreme attrition that this material has been subjected to. The pres-  ence of the tar layer is unusual. Jacob’s Well is thus not just another  example of a burnt mound to be understood in the same manner as   those found elsewhere. Kaliff, in his discussion of burnt mounds from   Östergötland, eastern mid- Sweden, has called into question the stand- ard functional interpretations in which the presence of fire- cracked  stones is regarded as simply being the residue of other activities, either  functional or ritual (e.g. steam raising, cremation, cooking): ‘we ought  to ask ourselves why we find it difficult to accept the burning of stone  as a deliberate ritual element, whereas we have no problems accepting  212 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="24"> 213 the same when it comes to the burning of the human body’ (Kaliff  2007: 121). His argument is that the stone was burnt for ritual reasons  as part of a deliberate process analogous with the manner in which a  dead body is fragmented and disintegrated during cremation. This is  a cogent and important argument but Kaliff does not take it further by  discussing the material properties of the stones found in the Swedish   burnt mounds, transformed by a combination of fire and water. In rela- tion to Jacob’s Well a much stronger argument can be made in this   respect. Reflecting on the ritual destruction of the pebbles at Jacob’s Well  we can draw clear parallels with the destruction of metalwork in the  Middle and Late Bronze Age, often deposited in bogs (see e.g. Bradley  1990, 2000), and practices of cremation taking place elsewhere at  the same time, reducing the body to the self-s ame fragments of bone  through a fire ritual. Just as the individual pebbles at Jacob’s Well lost  their individuality of form, their self- identity, so did the corpse and the  bones of the body. Pebbles and people are being treated in exactly the  same way and both pebbles and people, when considered collectively,  are at once the same and different. Furthermore the burning and crush- ing of pebbles needs to be considered and understood in relation to  other contemporary and earlier practices taking place on the East Devon  Pebblebed heathlands. The construction of pebble cairns (see Chapters  3– 5) and pebble platforms elsewhere (see below) involved the collec- tion and curation of pebbles in high places, dry, exposed to the heavens.   At Jacob’s Well the mound of fire-c racked pebbles covered an earlier  water shrine with a wooden structure, situated in a bog and venerat- ing a natural spring at the base of the escarpment of the Pebblebeds.  Afterwards the place was abandoned. The major constitutive qualities of the pebbles, their smoothness   and their bright colours, were destroyed by the fire rituals and the sys- tematic crushing of the pebbles. First, the fire metaphorically drained the  colours of the pebbles; second, their smooth and rounded forms were  reduced to jagged and angular fragments by hammer blows. Table 6.5  shows a set of structural contrasts between Jacob’s Well and the pebble  cairns.  We might regard the cairns as a celebration of the pebbles  and their qualities. At Jacob’s Well these are being systematic- ally destroyed through acts of violence. If accumulating pebbles in  cairns symbolized the wealth and power of the local community  as argued in Chapter  7, then their destruction can be regarded as  a ritual killing akin to practices such as the Potlatch ceremonies of  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 213 </page> <page sequence="25"> 214  Table 6.5 Contrasts between Jacob’s Well and Bronze Age pebble cairns.

Pebble sculptures on Aylesbeare Common  During the summer of 1937 George Carter and his small excavation  team, which included his three daughters, Priscilla, Ruth and Mary, car- ried out a series of excavations of ‘pebbled mounds’ on the summit area  of Aylesbeare Common, forming the northern part of the heathlands.  These low and discreet features had been discovered following swaling  (fire burning) of the area in 1936. Carter excavated, or part-e xcavated,  six low mounds up to 20 cm high which he described as resembling a  ‘keyhole’ in plan. They consisted of a small rectangular mound about 3  m long attached to, in some cases, a circular platform about 5 m in diam- eter. Excavation of the rectangular mounds revealed elaborate pebble  platforms beneath of an entirely different shape. Two of them were in the  shape of double-b laded ceremonial axes, tapering inwards at the centre  and widening out at the ends but in a somewhat asymmetrical fashion.  The other five platforms excavated by Carter were roughly trapezoidal  in form, one short end of the pebble platform being significantly longer   than the other (Figures 6.15– 6.17). 214 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="26"> 215   Figure 6.15 Aylesbeare platform no. 1 during excavation, 1937  (Source: Carter archive)  The structures that Carter excavated were found on sloping ground  dropping away to the north and the east down to a large amphithea- tre- shaped bog below the hill summit, about 200 m to the northeast of  the massive Early Bronze Age summit cairn. In this same general area  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 215 </page> <page sequence="27"> 216   Figure 6.16 Aylesbeare no. 2 (Source: Carter archive) of Aylesbeare Common but 200 m or more distant (Figure 6.18), lower   down the slope and much closer to the bog, General Simcoe had set up  a temporary encampment for his troops around 1799 at the time of the   Napoleonic wars, when there was a threat of a French invasion (see  Chapter 11).  Carter maintained that the pebble platforms that he had excavated  were prehistoric, of Iron Age date, and could be understood as part of a  sacrificial cult (Carter 1938). But given a lack of any artefacts associated  with them and the absence of the technique of radiocarbon dating there  was no possibility of dating them. For over 70 years no archaeological  investigations have been made on Aylesbeare Common and Carter’s work  and the spectacular finds he made have been almost entirely forgotten.  Some have assumed that the pebble platforms he discovered might be  of Napoleonic date, too, and constructed by General Simcoe’s troops,  since they lack any direct parallels in either prehistoric Britain or Europe.  216 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="28"> 217   Figure 6.17 Aylesbeare no. 5 (Source: Carter archive) However, they also lack any eighteenth- or nineteenth-c entury parallels  and there is no evidence of any activity by Simcoe’s troops in the area  where they are found (see Chapter 11). In September 2009 the East Devon Pebblebeds Project undertook  a field survey following swaling by the RSPB of the general area where  the mounds Carter excavated were found, and undertook a small series  of excavations on Aylesbeare Common in order to attempt to locate peb- ble platforms of the same kind, but without success, although remains  of Napoleonic date were discovered. Small areas of the heath were also  cut of vegetation in the spring of 2010 in areas where Carter had found  his platforms, but nothing came to light (he left no precise plan of their  location). It seems likely that the platforms Carter excavated are now  destroyed, probably during extensive military use of the area in the  Second World War.

The summit cairn with path curving around it is in the foreground to  the left. The topsoil- scraped area where one of the natural test pebble  samples was excavated is the white patch in the middle of the picture.  To the right of it is the amphitheatre- shaped bog. The pebble platforms  are located to the left of the white track running away into the distance  beyond the summit barrow (Source: author) During 1996 the RSPB had undertaken topsoil- scraping opera- tions in a different area of the Aylesbeare summit: about 200 m to the  northwest of the summit barrow. A series of damaged pebble structures  were uncovered and partly cleaned, and two were almost intact. These  were subsequently covered over again with soil and their positions  marked with small wooden posts. One of the best-p reserved structures  was uncovered in March 2010 by Toby Taylor of the RSPB and exca- vated during September by the project team. This structure had been  covered with a blue plastic sheet and with redeposited topsoil, presum- ably from the immediate surroundings. This redeposited soil surrounds  218 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="30"> 219 the platform today and it has no associated archaeological contexts or  features. If any existed they may have been removed by the topsoil-  scraping operations. The subsequent year two further structures were  relocated by the RSPB in the dense heath vegetation of heather and  gorse and excavated. The 2010 and 2011 excavations revealed three spectacular pebble  structures very similar to those reported by Carter (Figures 6.19– 6.21).   One was trapezoidal in form but with ‘horns’ or extensions at the shorter  end. This is a unique feature of this particular platform. None of those   recorded by Carter seems to have had ‘horns’ or extensions at the nar-  rower end. Another platform was in the shape of a double- bladed axe   and the third, more damaged example resembles an ox-h ide. There  were no traces of a rectangular covering mound or attached low circu- lar platforms. If these did exist they had been removed by the earlier  topsoil- scraping operations. All these structures were found on gently  north- sloping ground, as were Carter’s. It appears from one of his pho- tographs that the attached circular platform was down-s lope of the peb- ble structure. The long axis of all three platforms was NE–S W, matching   Carter’s description, and they were similar in size. Carter reported that  the six structures he recorded were close together and parallel to each    Figure 6.19 The trapezoidal platform with horns (scale: 1 m)  (Source: author) Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 219 </page> <page sequence="31"> 20   Figure 6.20 The double- axe platform (scale: 1 m) (Source: author) other, about 6 m apart (Carter 1938: 94). Those excavated by the project  team were between 60 and 75 m apart, and located at various positions  on the hill slope, the trapezoidal- shaped platform being highest up the  slope and furthest to the west and the ox-h ide- shaped platform lowest   down the slope and furthest to the east (Figure 6.22). 220 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="32"> 21   Figure 6.21 The ox- hide platform (scale: 1 m) (Source: author)  The trapezoidal platform with ‘horns’ (SY 05327 90208)  (Figure 6.19 and Figure 6.23)  The platform is made up of 1,337 multicoloured pebbles. It is 2.8 m long,  1.6 m wide at the broader end and 0.8 m wide at the narrower end. It is  oriented NNE– SSW with two projecting ‘horns’ at the narrow NNE end.  The southern part is level, the northern end with the extensions dips  below the ground surface. Larger pebbles are used to define the edges of  the platform. There are many broken pebbles used on the flat southern  end but very few in the dipping northern end. The pebbles are set either  with their thin edge uppermost or with their broad face uppermost. It  was apparent from the section (see below) that the pebbles here had  been set vertically rather than horizontally so that only the top of the   pebble was visible and the bulk buried.  The pebbles are bright and multicoloured throughout the platform  and there is no evidence for selective colour choice or arrangements of  differently coloured pebbles. The platform was partially damaged on the  western side towards the narrower end, where pebbles were missing.  This might have occurred during the topsoil scraping or it could be ear- lier. There were also some recent fractures on some of the pebbles else- where on the western side.

A  small  section 24 cm wide and 60 cm long was cut into the platform in an area  that had already been extensively damaged. The rest of the structure was  left intact. The section revealed that the pebbles inside were laid, like  teeth, with their long axis placed vertically, thus providing maximum  stability. They are of a fairly uniform size, between 5 and 15 cm long  (Figure  6.24).The section provided evidence of the manner in which  the platform had been constructed. Clay was mixed with reddish sand,  forming a kind of cement that was laid on the grey natural soil surface  and the pebbles were embedded in it end-o n, with only the top showing.  The difference in the colours was apparent when excavating the section  and small lenses of the orange material are visible in the photographs of  the section. Forty-o ne small charcoal samples (and possible charcoal)  were recovered from a secure context in the buried palaeosoil under the  pebble platform and from the orange material in which the pebbles were  embedded when being laid. This charcoal was in the orange mixture and  does not indicate any fire under the platform. These were analysed by  Dana Challinor. Six fragments were of Ulex/C ytisus (gorse) roundwood,  two of birch (Betulaceae) and the rest indeterminate or sediment. One  of the gorse samples from the clay matrix in which the pebbles were  224 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="36"> 25 embedded gave an AMS date of 790±30 BP; cal. AD 1210 to 1280  (BETA 291085). One sample of birch charcoal from the junction of the  palaeosoil and the clay matrix in which the pebbles were buried gave  an AMS date of 3120±40 BP; 1460 to 1310 cal. BC (BETA 291086).  Another, also of birch charcoal from the palaeosoil beneath the plat- form, gave an AMS date of 3010±40 BP; 1390 to 1120 cal. BC (BETA  288899), that is, both of later Middle Bronze Age date. There were no   finds in the section.  The double axe (AB11- 2) (SY 05402  90186) (Figure 6.20 and Figure 6.25)  The platform has the shape of a double axe. The long axis of the plat- form is generally oriented north–s outh (NNW– SSE), exactly the same as  the ox- hide- shaped platform and very similar to that of the trapezoidal  shape. The south- oriented blade is nicely curved, while the northern one  is wider and flat. The long axis measures 3.77 m and it is 2.28 m wide in  the northern end and 1.82 m in the southern, while the narrowest width  in the centre is 1.12 m. It is composed of 1,234 pebbles. In the platform  we discovered deliberate patterning – there is an elevated stripe of peb- bles in the middle of the narrowest part symbolizing the presence of a  haft. The top of this elevated stripe is about 2 cm higher than the rest of  the platform. It consists of four lines of pebbles, which are all arranged so  that their narrow oval side is turned upwards and set along the long axis  of the platform (see Figure 6.25). The vegetation cover of gorse and heather, which was about 150 cm  high, was removed and the surface soil deposited on the structure by the  RSPB to protect it in 1996. The thickness of the layer was between 15 cm  to 25 cm. Under the deposited soil a piece of blue plastic was found – laid  down by the RSPB to protect the structure. The plastic film covered the cen- tral part of the structure, uncovered during machine scraping of the area. At the southern end of the structure five pieces of blue slate were  found. Their context is insecure, as they might have been brought with  the redeposited soil. The structure was very well preserved: only minor damage was  visible in the southeast part, northeast part and on the elevated stripe.  The central part was probably hit by the machine and the damage on  the edges could have been caused by roots of vegetation. A 20- cm- wide  section was excavated across the middle of the structure. This revealed  that the pebbles had been set with their long axis placed vertically. All  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 225 </page> <page sequence="37"> 26   Figure 6.25 Plan of the double-a xe platform.

All the removed pebbles were colour coded,  weighed and measured. Then the loose soil – residues from vegetation  cover between the pebbles – was removed and the clay matrix in which  the pebbles were set was excavated in millimetres, using small trowels.  In the mix eight fragments of charcoal were found. Only two proved suit- able for dating, an indeterminate twig and an indeterminate piece of  round wood. One of these provided an AMS date of 750±30BP; cal. AD  1220– 80 (Beta 308027). The mixture in which pebbles were set was very  tough, strongly cemented. It had a red-b rown colour and it was distinct- ively different from the natural ground surface. The mixture in which  the pebbles were embedded was, compared to the other two excavated  platforms, the most uniform, without any lenses of differently coloured  components. It was hardened like cement and was composed of brown  clay and red sandy soil. In it there were a few very small pebbles up to 2  cm in size (fewer than eight in the 10 cm3 excavated). The mixture was   laid on the natural surface and in the centre it was 12 cm thick.  The ox- hide platform (AB11- 1) (SY 05455 90155)  (Figure 6.21 and Figure 6.26)  This platform has a trapezoidal shape to which substantial rounded  extensions are connected at the southern end. The result is that the plat- form has four corners and thus resembles an ox hide. It is composed of  1,844 pebbles. Some patterning in the placement of pebbles was recog- nizable at the southern end of the platform. There were pebbles arranged  into two parallel lines going along the long axis of the platform, and in  the extensions pebbles were arranged into curved lines, thus emphasiz- ing the overall morphology (see Figure 6.21). The long axis of the plat- form measures 4.92 m. Its southern end with the extensions is 3.03 m  long. The narrow part (about 1.5 m from the southern end) is 1.4 m wide  and from that point the trapezoid opens out and if it was not destroyed in  the western corner it would be about 4 m wide. This is the largest of the three structures we excavated. During  topsoil removal one piece of unworked flint was found; however, its  provenience is uncertain. The southern part of the platform is very well  preserved; however, the northeastern side was substantially damaged,  probably by the topsoil- scraping operations. We cut a section across the  middle of the structure 20 cm wide in an east– west direction. Pebbles in  the section were numbered and planned. Excavation of the section was  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 227 </page> <page sequence="39"> 28   Figure 6.26 Plan of the ox-h ide platform (Source: author) 228 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="40"> 29 the same as for the double axe. Twenty- seven small flakes of charcoal  found in the section were collected and plotted. Two of these samples,  both of Ulex/ Cytisus roundwood proved suitable for dating. One of these  provided an AMS date of 240±30BP; cal. AD 1640– 70 and 1780– 1800  (Beta 308028). The matrix in which the pebbles were set was far less uni- form compared to the double axe. The general colour of the mix was red-  brown; however, there were occasional lenses of grey colour. The pebbles  were set in a clay material that was 12 cm thick in the centre and it was  laid on the natural surface, again with the pebbles set with their long axis  placed vertically. There was a clear distinction between the mix and the   natural surface, which was of grey- brown colour.  Comparison with Carter’s excavations  Carter, in his report on the pebble structures that he excavated, states  that the circular platform that was part of his Aylesbeare no. 1 structure  had a saucer-s haped pit below it with a maximum depth of 90 cm extend- ing all the way to the perimeter, and that there were traces of ‘prolonged  fires’ (Carter 1938: 91). He also suggested that there was a lower pebble  platform beneath the pebble structure itself and again traces of fire with  much ash but no charcoal. He recovered some flint flakes underneath the  top (axe- shaped) platform. Carter’s lower platform appears to be entirely  natural. The details of the excavations provided report the presence of  ‘ash’ under his Aylesbeare no. 9. In our sections of the three platforms we  excavated there was no evidence of in situ preserved fire or detectable ash  residues although the areas excavated were small so as to minimize distur- bance to the pebble structures. Carter does not mention the type of mate- rial in which the pebbles were embedded. He reports that his Aylesbeare  no. 5 and no. 8 had a belt of large pebbles across the narrower part (Carter  1938: 94). These observations match the raised band of pebbles we   observed across the double-a xe structure.  The character of the pebbles  Plans of the three platforms show their very different morphologies and  states of preservation (Figure 6.23, Figure 6.25 and Figure 6.26). They  differ in size from west to east across the area in which they were discov- ered, the smallest being to the west and the largest to the east. All the peb- bles removed from the sections were weighed and measured.

In all cases the vast majority of the pebbles were either oval in shape or  somewhat irregular in form. The percentage of broken pebbles used to  construct the platforms also differs: 44 and 45 per cent of those on the  trapezoidal and ox- hide sections were broken, 18 per cent of those in the  double axe. In most cases the broken end of the pebble was placed down-  wards with the top end uppermost to give a uniform appearance.  These different characteristics of the pebbles used to construct the  three platforms suggest deliberate selection of pebbles of a different but  fairly uniform size for each in advance of their construction. Test samples  of all surface pebbles from two 1- m- square topsoil- scraped areas where  pebbles were exposed to the northeast (SY 05603 90278) and east (SY  06019 89823) of the platforms were analysed (Table 6.8 and Table 6.9).  The weights of the majority of the pebbles from the northeast test square  are broadly similar to those in the trapezoidal platform but differ substan- tially from those in the other two. Otherwise both the pebble weights and  lengths differ substantially between the platforms and the test squares,   again suggesting deliberate selection of pebbles in terms of weight and size.  All the pebbles on the surface of the three platforms were colour  coded according to basic colour categories (grey, yellow, brown, red,  black, blue and white (quartz)).

Pebbles of different colour were not used in different parts of  the platforms; they are multicoloured, mimicking the colours of the peb- bles found across the Pebblebed landscape as a whole, as is the case for  the pebble cairns discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. It seems highly likely that  pebbles of the right size were collected in the vicinity of the structures  themselves, most probably those exposed at the surface, although the  use of small and shallow quarry pits that would leave no trace cannot be  ruled out. This might be the significance of the saucer-s haped pit Carter  describes as underlying the circular platform attached to the rectangular   mound overlying his Aylesbeare no. 1 axe- shaped pebble structure. We further classified the pebbles from the sections according to  whether they had ‘special’ characteristics such as unusual mottled and vari- able colours or striking quartz veins or inclusions. This was not really feasi- ble to undertake for the surface of the platforms themselves since most of  the surface area of the pebbles was buried. These special pebbles made up  28 per cent of the pebbles in the ox- hide platform section and 33 per cent  of those in the double-a xe platform, whereas those from the sample test  squares were 0.9 per cent and 5.3 per cent. This striking difference suggests  that there was differential selection of pebbles for inclusion in the structures  not only in terms of size but also in terms of intrinsic qualities of the pebbles  themselves: the often intricate patterns and colours of their surfaces, a form   of inalienable local wealth as discussed above in Chapter 5 and in Chapter 7. Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 231 </page> <page sequence="43"> 23  Dating and soil micromorphology The five AMS radiocarbon dates from the three platforms provided strikingly  different results. Two are of later Middle Bronze Age date, two are from the   Middle Ages and one from the late eighteenth century. All the structures are  highly likely to have been constructed at about the same time and therefore  the validity of some of these dates needs questioning. The birch samples  from the trapezoidal-s haped platform with horns are derived from charcoal  in the buried palaeosoil beneath the platform and at the junction of this and  the clay matrix in which the pebbles were embedded. The other three sam- ples from the trapezoidal, axe-s haped and ox-h ide-s haped structures derive  from two gorse and one indeterminate fragment of charcoal recovered from  the clay matrix in which the pebbles are set. Soil micromorphological ana- lysis of the double-a xe- and ox-h ide- shaped structures has shown extensive  bioturbation and mixing of deposits, with palynological data being moved  down through the profile and possibly up through the profile by mesofaunal  agents as well (Banerjea, Appendix 14). There are three different C14 date ranges from the platforms. We  understand the first two – the Middle Bronze Age dates – as the positive  result and the three later dates as contaminated samples. From the soil  micromorphology analyses carried out on the ox- hide and double-a xe  platforms we know that both the matrix in which pebbles are set and  the buried old land surface are strongly bioturbated, which automati- cally puts all dating attempts into question. The Bronze Age dates and the  three other dates come from contrasting environments – in the first two  cases the dated charcoal comes from a woodland plant, whereas the three  later dates are from heathland plants. The heathland has been repeatedly  burnt, thus it is no surprise that the charcoal from these burning episodes  has percolated down deep into the structure as a result of bioturbance.  The charcoal from the birch samples that we interpret as the positive  result represents for us a residue of a fire that was carried out to clear the  area before the clay matrix was laid and that is why it was preserved at the  junction of the two. In case of the Aylesbeare platforms there is always room for ques- tioning the dating – but in cases with strong bioturbation there is no way  forward other than to use a cumulative argument. There are three strong  reasons why we consider the Bronze Age date as the correct one: (1) the  position of the charcoal samples; (2) the right type of woodland plant for  the period; and (3) the morphology of the dated platforms typical of a  common repertoire of forms in the Bronze Age discussed below. There is  no evidence for any similar structures made out of pebbles anywhere in  232 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="44"> 23 the area of the East Devon Pebblebeds. In the eighteenth and nineteenth  century there was widespread use of pebbles to pave farmyards, church  interiors, paths and roads, build walls and provide foundation stones for  houses built out of wattle and daub, but ‘ornamental’ structures of the  form and character that we excavated are simply not known either for  this or the earlier medieval period (see Chapter 13). The shapes and locations of these structures themselves immediately  suggest that they are of Bronze Age date. We know that cairns constructed  out of pebbles dating to the Early Bronze Age were built across the heath- lands, including the two nearby summit cairns on Aylesbeare Common less  than 200 m distant from the platforms. The Bronze Age people had consider- able skill in building pebble monuments in the landscape and exerted much  effort in this regard. The short distance between the structures that we exca- vated and those discovered by Carter, all located slightly downslope and in  the immediate vicinity of the massive summit cairns, suggests a direct link  between these two very different types of monument. The summit cairns are  visible from all three platforms. The long axis of all three of the platforms is  oriented towards Hembury, with its Early Neolithic causewayed enclosure,  a monument that we might expect to have had a generalized ancestral sig- nificance during the Bronze Age (see Chapter 1). Bronze Age pebble cairns  at Manor Farm are visible a few kilometres to the north. One of the ‘horns’  of the trapezoidal platform points in the direction of the Raddon Hills, with  another Neolithic causewayed enclosure, the other in the direction of East  Hill and the rising sun around midsummer. From all of them the dramatic  equinoxal sunrise, framed by the Sidmouth gap between the East Hill and  Peak Hill ridges, is fully visible (see Figure 1.15b) They might form part of a  ceremonial complex connected with the summit cairns and ceremonial and  mortuary rites taking place here as discussed below. The platforms are of a  size that can comfortably accommodate a body on top of them and one possi- bility is that they might have been used as temporary resting places for bodies  prior to cremation or as excarnation platforms, but any contextual evidence  for this, for example the stake holes of a palisade fence surrounding them, is   now lost.  Parallels and analogies  The shape of the pebble platform with its two ‘horns’ is most striking and  it might be broadly understood as being anthropomorphic. Trapezoidal  shapes have been repeatedly interpreted as a body or as an anthropo- morphic shape in the archaeological literature.

In the Bronze Age the symbolism of horns, double axes and trap- ezoids (axes) are intertwined. General analogies can be drawn with an  extensive repertoire of anthropomorphic designs in various media found  elsewhere in Europe: with Bronze Age rock art motifs in Scandinavia,  Copper Age schist plaque figurines from Portugal and anthropomor- phic designs on pottery, bronzes and pendants from the central and   eastern European Copper and Bronze Age, some of which we discuss  further below.  Horns  Anthropomorphic figures with horns occur in many parts of Europe dur- ing the Bronze Age. A bronze head from Fogtdarp in southern Sweden  with horns and a double axe between them directly resembles representa- tions of a Minoan ox head with horns and a double axe between the horns  (Kristiansen and Larsson 2005: 330). There are further parallels between  images in Swedish rock art and those found elsewhere:  the famous   engraving of a horned god on a boat with rowers from Bohuslän (Briard  caption for Figure 6.27 continued form for an anthropomorphic   pendant from Žichlice, Plzeň- sever region, Czech Republic, Nynice   culture, Late Bronze Age (Jiráň 2008: colour supplement 4); female  figure (a goddess) decoration on a square vessel, Hungary, Bronze Age   (Kalicz 1970: b/ w supplement, plates 28– 9); a vase from Rákospalota,  Budapest XV, Hungary with super- elevated handles resembling horns,  Middle Bronze Age (Mozsolics 1967: 111); vase with two ram heads  decorating the handles from the Middle Bronze Age shrine in Romanian   Sărata Monteoru (Dumitrescu et al. 1983: plate XII); trapezoidal  (anthropomorphic) pendant from Ilichevka, Ukraine, Bronze Age  (Berezanskaja 1982: 175); trapezoidal (anthropomorphic) schist  plaque from Portugal, Age of Copper (http:// research2.its.uiowa.edu/  iberian/ view.php?cat_ num=14)  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 235 </page> <page sequence="47"> 236 1997:  168)  (Figure  6.27:  1), which has similarities with seal impres-  sions from Mochlos (Furmánek et al. 1991: 263)  (Figure 6.27: 2)  and  Knossos (Haysom 2010: 40) (Figure 6.27: 3) in Crete, but also in France   at Mont Bégo (Briard 1997: 100, 132, 168) or in a form of a pendant from  Ukrainian site of Ilichevka (Berezanskaja 1982: 175) (Figure 6.28: 9.).  These examples represent a group of horned figures with a head. There  are also examples of headless horned anthropomorphs, such as a horned   figure from Mont Bégo (Briard 1997: 132) with rather direct similari- ties to the platform from Aylesbeare Common, together with figures of   horned headless lure players from Kalleby, Tanum Bohuslän (Westholm  et al. 1964: plate 1). Anthropomorphic figures with horns appear in various other arte- facts. The shapes of horns can be discerned in the stylized form of pot  and vase handles. Some very early examples of this can be found in   the Late Copper Age Řivnáč culture in the Czech Republic (Pleiner and   Rybová 1978:  b/w  plate 20, p.  255). A  similar shape of elevated han- dles appeared also in the Middle and Late Bronze Age of Romania in the   Vatina culture, with the most remarkable examples from Sărata Monteoru  (Dumitrescu et al. 1983: plate XII) (Figure 6.26: 8) and from Hungary   (Bóna 1975: table 112; Mozsolics 1967: 111 (Figure 6.27: 7). Handles  with horns lower down pottery vessels also appear in the Otomani cul- ture (Bader 1978: 170). Representations of what are indisputably bull  horns that occur on pottery vessels as handles are commonplace from  the Middle Bronze Age Terramare settlements of the Po valley, northern   Italy (Brea et al. 1997).  Bronze and more rarely golden pendants are the most numerous  category of artefacts discussed here. Their typology has been precisely  elaborated (e.g. seven types of heart- like pendants are distinguished in   Hänsel 1968: 115–1 8). The pendants we refer to have various shapes:  that of a heart, lyre, moon, funnel (cast) or triangle (made from metal   plates). Regardless of the chronology and the traditional typology, nine  pendant types are shaped like horns (cf. examples in Figure 6.27) and  these are commonplace during the Bronze Age throughout much of  Europe. Horns can also form part of a pendant, for example the case of the   pendant from Včelince, Slovakia (Figure  6.28:  1)  (type Nagyhángos),  which has, because of the shape of its horns, parallels to the seal men-  tioned above from Crete (Furmánek et al. 1991: 263) (Figure 6.28: 2).  Alternatively a whole pendant can have the shape of horns (Figure 6.28:  2– 9). Horns can have a very simple form as pendants, for example those   from Dunaújváros, Hungary (Bóna 1975:  55)  (Figure  6.28:  4), from  236 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="48"> 237   Figure 6.28 Pendants with horns from middle and eastern Europe:   pendant from Včelince, Slovakia, type Nagyhángos (Furmánek et al.  1991: 263); moon- shaped decorated pendant from Slovakia, fifteenth   century BC (Furmánek 1979: 35); pendant with double horns,   Rétzkörberencs, Hungary (Mozsolics 1985: 431); simple form of   pendant, Dunaújváros, Hungary (Bóna 1975: 55); lyre- shaped pendant,   Blučina (Salaš 2005 a: 292 and 2005b: 67); heart- shaped pendant from   Včelince, Slovakia, culture of southeast Urnfields (Furmánek et al. 1991:  158– 9); pendant from Koszidec, Hungary (Briard 1997: 50); ribbed  pendant from Kisterenye, Hungary (Mozsolics 1973: 292); pendant   from Szomód, Hungary (Mozsolics 1967: 229); golden pendant with  three horns at the end from the Big Ipatovo kurgan in Stavropol region,  Russia (Korenevskij et al. 2007: 189) Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 237 </page> <page sequence="49"> 238  Koszidec, Hungary (Briard 1997:  50)  (Figure  6.28:  7)  and Szomód,  Hungary (Mozsolics 1967:  229)  (Figure  6.28:  9). More elaborated is   a lyre- shaped pendant (Figure  6.28:  5)  from Blučina, Czech Republic   (Salaš 2005a: 292). Horns can be also duplicated (see Figure 6.28: 2 and  Figure 6.28: 3). The former is a moon- shaped decorated pendant from   Slovakia from the fifteenth century BC (Furmánek 1979: 35), the latter   comes from Rétzkörberencs, Hungary (Mozsolics 1985:  431). Special  types of precious artefacts can also be included into the category of the  horn- shaped pendant, for example a golden pendant with three horns  at the end (Figure 6.28: 10)  from the Big Ipatovo kurgan in Stavropol   region, Russia (Korenevskij et al. 2007: 189).  The double axe  The double axe is best-k nown from Crete (Figure 6.27: 4). Bronze dou- ble axes appear throughout the Bronze Age in eastern Europe (e.g.  Romania, see Bader 1978:  217; Ukraine, see Berezanskaja 1986:  107   or Balaguri 1990: 98; Slovakia, see Furmánek et al. 1991: b/w  supple-  ment 30 or Furmánek 1979: 26– 7; Hungary, see Bóna 1975: table 153 or   Mozsolics 1967: 211; Czech Republic, see Stuchlík 2006: 183–4 ). These  and finds in Western Europe (Hawkes 1940; Piggott 1953; Harding  1975: 190ff.) have often been cited as evidence of direct contact with the  Mediterranean since there are no local antecedents. The meaning of the double axe has been of great interest from the  beginning of Cretan archaeology until today (see e.g. Haysom 2010).  On rings and seals the double axe is carried by women. As Burkert puts  it: ‘The axe is never connected with a male figure, instead it is associated  with a female figure, probably a goddess ... an instrument and a sign of  her power’ (Burkert [1977] 1985: 38) (see Figure 6.27: 3). There is a direct connection between the horns and the double axe  on Crete in the Minoan period, where the double axe is often found as a  votive offering and as a cult object between the so called horns of con- secration (Pendlebury [1939] 1979: 274), which Arthur Evans under- stood as ‘the original type [of horns and which] is, a kind of impost  or base terminating at the ends in two horn- like excrescences’ (Evans  in Journal of Hellenic Studies, 21, p. 135 et seq., quoted in Mackenzie  [1917] 2008:  287). According to some, ‘the double axe is a symbol  of power ..., and, in sublime stylization, the cult of horns, recall the  overpowering of the bull’ (Burkert [1977] 1985: 38). Double axes and  238 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="50"> 239 horns also appear together in architecture – fragments from a cist in  the Thirteenth Magazine in the Knossos palace (MM IIIb period) show  a building with columns into which double-a xes are placed between  the columns. On the roof the sacred horns appear (Pendlebury [1939]  1979: 156). Gimbutas understands the double axe as an emblem of the  ‘Great Goddess’, and describes the pillar shrine in the palace at Knossos  as follows: ‘here the raised central column is fitted into a socket of bull’s  horns, below which is the ideogram of the Great Goddess’ (Gimbutas  1974: 80). In a small shrine from LM III period, found by Sir Arthur  Evans in the palace of Knossos, Gimbutas comments that ‘a higher plat- form with pebbled floor and plastered front, two pairs of horns of con- secration ... were set up. Leaning again one of them was a double- axe of  steatite with duplicated blades. Each of the horns had a central socket  which was meant to receive the shaft of the double axe’ (Gimbutas  1974: 75 and 78). The shape of the double axe is sometimes associated with a body,  or more specifically, a female body. Such bodies can be found as a pot- tery decoration in Hungary and Romania (Kalicz 1970: b/w  supplement,  plates 28–9  and Dumitrescu et al. 1983:fig. 13), or in a form of clay statu- ettes from the Balkans (Letica 1973:  tables 1, 2 and 7). Other types of  clay statuettes with a double- axe shape have been found in Ukraine and  Romania (Dumitrescu et al. 1983: plate XII and Balaguri 1990: 128).   Finally, bronze pendants in shapes resembling the double axe have also   been interpreted as anthropomorphic (e.g. Furmánek et al. 1991: 121;   Salaš 2005b: 276; Jiráň 2008: 223 and colour supplement 4). We illus- trate two examples from central Europe: a mould for an anthropomor-  phic pendant from Žichlice, Czech Republic (Nynice culture, Late Bronze   Age (Jiráň 2008: colour supplement 4)) and a much earlier example of  decoration in the shape of double axe: a female figure on a square vessel   from Hungary (Kalicz 1970: b/w  supplement, plates 28–9 ) (see Figure  6.28: 5 and Figure 6.28: 6).  The ox hide  It is well known that ox hides formed an important and standard part  of burial rites in Bronze Age Scandinavia, with the best- preserved   examples being reported from Denmark. These barrows with pro- nounced iron pans and exceptional preservation, from the middle and  south of Jutland and Schleswig in northern Germany, are dated to the  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 239 </page> <page sequence="51"> 240 Middle Bronze Age (1380–1 330 BC) and are discussed at length by Glob   (1974). To mention a few examples, in the huge barrow at Borum Eshøj  three oak coffins contained an elderly man between 50 and 60, an eld-  erly woman and a young man: all were wrapped in ox hides. These must  have been freshly flayed as part of the funerary rites as one was covered  with maggot skins (Glob 1974: 40). Uppermost in the old woman’s cof- fin from the same mound was an ox hide with the hairs still intact, with  grooves in it made by scraping (43). At Muldbjerg the ox hide covering   the corpse of a ‘chieftain’ had the hair side uppermost (77).  So- called ox- hide- shaped copper ingots dated to the Later Bronze  Age have a widespread distribution in prehistoric Europe throughout  the Mediterranean from around 1600 to 1100 BC. Single examples are  also found as far north as southwest Germany. Two or three tin ingots  of ox- hide shape amongst a hoard of 44 others are known from one of  two shipwrecks discovered off the Erme estuary in Bigbury Bay, south- ern Devon, only a short distance from the East Devon Pebblebed heath- lands (Fox 1995; Harding 2009). The metal finds indicate that one of  these shipwrecks dated to around 1200 BC, the other to around 900 BC.  The shape of these copper and tin ingots bears a general resemblance  to an ox hide because of the four projecting handles at both ends of the  rectangular body of the ingot. Ling and Stos-G ale have reported recent  discoveries of images of ox-h ide ingots in Scandinavian rock art from   Bohuslän along the west coast of Sweden and eastern central Sweden  (Ling and Stos- Gale 2015). The numbers of such rock carvings are  small, but their shapes are indeed suggestive of this interpretation. On  the basis of trace- element and lead- isotope analysis they also suggest  that some bronze tools in Sweden could have been made from Cypriot  copper, the main source of production for the ox- hide ingots in the   Mediterranean.  Bronze Age metalwork in East Devon Finds of metalwork on the Pebblebed heathlands of East Devon or their  immediate surroundings are sparse, amounting to only a few artefacts,  including a dagger, a palstave and a hoard of three gold bracelets together  with a folded sheet of gold dating to the Later Bronze Age (Pearce 1983;   Taylor 1999). In this respect it is of great interest to note one additional  find: that of a double-b laded copper shaft-h ole axe of Cypriot origin from   Mount Howe, Topsham. This was an unassociated find and was dug up  in a market garden by a labourer around 1911 (Pearce 1983: 601; Briggs  240 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="52"> 241   Figure 6.29 The double axe from Mount Howe, Topsham.

The form of the blade is almost identical in shape to  the axe-s haped Aylesbeare pebble platform (Figure  6.29). This axe is  one of only four double axes recorded from Britain, the other three hav- ing been found in Co. Antrim, Northern Ireland, the Bog of Allen, cen- tral Ireland, and Whitby on the northeast coast of England (Branigan  1970: 90; Harding 1975: 185–9 3). Such finds are dated to around 1200  BC or earlier and have long been regarded as providing evidence of long-  distance contacts and exchange between the Mediterranean and west- ern Europe (e.g. Hawkes 1940: Piggott 1953; Branigan 1970). Briggs,  however (1973: 320), casts doubt on any of these being genuine prehis- toric imports, suggesting instead that they might have been acquired by  collectors and subsequently sold to museums. The find circumstances of  the three other British examples are indeed entirely unknown, unlike  those recorded for the Topsham axe. Further examination of the general  find location provides more suggestive evidence that this find at least is   indeed a genuine Cypriot import.  Mount Howe is a distinctive dome- shaped hill situated between the  confluence of the river Clyst and the river Exe in the southern part of    Figure 6.30 Mount Howe on the Exe estuary between the Clyst  and the Exe: the area just beyond the buildings in the centre of the  photograph (Source: author) 242 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="54"> 243 Topsham. This is the point at which the Exe estuary dramatically wid- ens and salt and sea water mix together. The meandering river Clyst  and its boggy floodplain together with the Exe estuary bound the hill on  all sides, with land access only from the north (Figure 6.30). Formerly  the river Clyst ended in its own estuary, meeting that of the Exe. The  meeting of two estuaries providing a sheltered port, the dome-s haped  hill between them and the mingling of salt and fresh water all suggest a  highly charged symbolic location in the landscape (see Tilley 2010 for  general discussion), at which the deposition of an exotic Cypriot Bronze  Axe might well seem appropriate. Mount Howe is situated only 9 km to  the southwest of the heathlands of Aylesbeare Common and is intervis- ible with the summit barrows in the vicinity of which the pebble plat-  forms are found. Topsham itself was an important port from well before  the Roman occupation, when it became the port of the Roman city of Isca   Dumnoniorum (Exeter).  The anthropomorphic pebble platform with horns, the double axe  and the ox hide can be broadly understood as ritual and cosmological  symbols drawing together the worlds of the living and the dead. The first  is a manifestation of a body with horns, perhaps a form of the ‘bull body’  found in western Swedish rock art (Ling and Rowlands 2015). There is  an obvious link between this and the ox hide used to wrap the body in  the context of mortuary rites symbolized by another of the pebble plat- forms. The ox hide itself can be understood as male, the bull with the  head removed. In the centre and between the two there is the double  axe, a widespread symbol of ritual power and authority found in vari- ous contexts from Mycenae to Scandinavia. It is also symbolically associ- ated with the bull with horns and in its southern European context has  strong female connotations. It is located between the horns of the bull  that occur on either side of it. If we consider the three pebble structures  as representing a set of widely held cosmological ideas linked to stages  of mortuary rites we can broadly understand them in terms of a series of  symbolic and ritual transformations. A dead body with horns in the west  is sanctified by the ritual and female powers of the ritual double axe to  be ‘wrapped’ for burial on the ox- hide platform to the east that is nearest  to the pebble cairns. This progression of bodily states and rites from west  to east is itself associated with the rising equinoxal sun in the east, dra- matically framed by the gap through the hills on the skyline to the east,  symbolizing the widespread theme found throughout the Bronze Age of   death and the regeneration of life. We have seen that during the Early Beaker period of the Bronze Age   small pebble cairns were constructed that do not seem to be associated  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 243 </page> <page sequence="55"> 24 with mortuary practices but rather with fire rituals and solar rites. Later  in the Early and Middle Bronze Age much larger monumental and prom- inent cairns were constructed at high points in the landscape, such as  the two summit cairns on Aylesbeare Common, with which the pebble  sculptures are closely associated. These large cairns amassed carefully  curated pebbles and thus became charged with symbolic potency and  power. At the same time pebbles were being symbolically killed in the  bog at Jacob’s Well:  two diametrically opposed processes, the former   involving the accumulation of pebble wealth, the latter its destruction.  We now put forward a conceptual model for the Middle Bronze Age of  the Pebblebeds.  Conclusion: rivers of life and rivers of death  The mouth and course of the river Exe to the west of the Pebblebed  cairns may have been both actually and conceptually associated with   death. By contrast, the Otter, to the east, may have been associated with  birth and the regeneration of life. These possible associations are worth  exploring a little further, with reference both to the physical charac- teristics of the two rivers and their association with Pebblebed cairns.   The Exe, with its source on Exmoor, far to the north, is a major river  linking different landscapes with Bronze Age settlement and barrows   and cairns across the southwest peninsula. By contrast, the Otter, with  its source in the Blackdown Hills, is of specific local significance. In  other words, it is far more intimately related to the East Devon land-  scape and, as discussed in Chapter 1, the locations of the barrows on   the Pebblebed heathlands are intimately related to valleys and streams  flowing into it. No such intimate relation can be claimed in relation to   the cairn locations and streams flowing west towards the Exe from the  spring line at the base of the Pebblebed scarp. The lower stretches of   the Exe, visible from cairn 19 (see Figure 1.10) and the highest part of  Woodbury Common, are inundated by the sea twice a day as this is a   wide tidal estuary. The river meanders sluggishly through shifting mud  and sandbanks in an estuary up to 2 km wide (Figure 1.14). The mud  and sand are left exposed and then covered by the tides and the smell  is salty and brackish. At the mouth of the estuary there are particularly  violent and dangerous currents. The water is saline, muddy and unfit  to drink. The Exe estuary would make an ideal depository for the bod- ies of the dead, only a small minority of whom would ever have been  buried in the Pebblebed cairns. Acting as a kind of sump it would soon  244 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="56"> 245  conceal and bury or wash away the remains of the dead. The Exe could  then have provided the ideal place for the disposal and forgetting of  the dead. We know from numerous finds of unburnt bones from rivers  that river burial took place during the Bronze Age (Bradley and Gordon   1988; Garton et al. 1997). In this respect it is interesting to note the  large concentration of Bronze Age barrows clustering in the very bot- tom and lower slopes of the Exe valley itself just beyond its tidal limit.   Here at least 29 are recorded by Grinsell (1983: 13) and about as many  more as ring ditches by aerial photography of the same area (Griffith  and Quinnell 1999c), just to the north of the symbolically important  confluence of the river Yeo or Creedy, the river Exe and the river Culm  about 9 km north of the normal tide limit (itself extending about 12 km  inland from the river mouth).  No barrow cemeteries occur along the bottom of the Otter valley,  whose normal tide limit extends only a few kilometres inland. The closest  possible barrows to the Otter itself are a pair of ring ditch sites about 150  m to the east of Wrinkly Cliff, an impressive red sandstone river cliff, just  over 1 km to the south of Newton Poppleford in the Pebblebed heathland  area. Otherwise, the nearest to it are the barrows and cairns situated  along the East Hill and Peak Hill ridges, those located further to the west  in the central Pebblebed heathlands themselves and on the spurs and   ridges of the Blackdown Hills to the north (Griffith and Quinnell 1999c:  map 6.5).  The river Otter, in contrast to the Exe, has a shallow and stony bed.  The water is fresh, clear and fast- flowing: a most unsuitable and inap- propriate place for the disposal of corpses. Only its very lowest reaches,  the last few kilometres, form a muddy estuary, that is itself today almost  completely blocked by an enormous pebble bank at its mouth as a result  of west to east longshore drift. A  few hundred years ago the river was  navigable as far inland as Otterton (now 3 km inland from the mouth).  The Otter flows beneath what have been suggested to be two very sig- nificant ancestral hills, Dumpdon and High Peak, and mixes together  angular stones from these hills together with those derived from the  Pebblebed exposures, a river of life associated with ancestors, pebbles,  pebble cairns, pebble streams and fresh drinking- water. If the Exe, situated to the west and thus associated with the dying  sun, represented a river of death, the Otter to the east might be concep- tualized as a river of life. It was associated with the reborn sun, framed  and shining through the gaps between the ridges and hills. In relation to  the activities of the living and the disposal of remains of their dead, the  locations of the cairns on the Pebblebed heathlands in between these two  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 245 </page> <page sequence="57"> 246   Figure 6.31 Conceptual model of the Pebblebed landscape in the late  Early/ Middle Bronze Age (Source: author)  rivers can be regarded as betwixt and between, liminal places (Figure  6.31). The pebble cairns erected here, with their complex internal pat- terning and structural organization, were perhaps associated with the  remains of, and offerings to, founding ancestors. The continued presence of the outcropping Pebblebeds inland   from the sea in the form of surface pebbles covering the heathland may  well have been recognized and understood as the inland presence of  246 landscape in the longue durée </page> <page sequence="58"> 247 the same band of pebbles seen running through the red sandstone cliffs   on the beach at Budleigh Salterton. This band of pebbles might well  have been understood by prehistoric populations in a similar manner  to the way in which geologists explain it today: as the course of a dead  and ancient river. There could, then, be no more fitting place than the  Pebblebed heathlands themselves to erect cairns to the memory of the  ancestral dead.  The pebbles may have been understood as a special material cre- ated by the ancestors, a gift from the dead to the living that was then used  to honour the dead. From the Neolithic onwards there is indisputable evi- dence, discussed in previous chapters, for both an interest in and use of  the pebbles: their selective procurement, transport and relocation, use in  broken form as temper for Neolithic pottery, arrangement into geometric  patterns, the construction of large cairns and small pebble structures, the  selection and arrangement of pebbles of unusual colour, their association  with springs, water sources, the rising sun and the cardinal directions.  The multicoloured pebble cairns and their associated pebble plat-  forms may thus have been conceived as transitional places situated  between the world of the dead and the world of the living. They them- selves were constructed from and rested on the colour- charged pebbles  of an ancestral river connecting together these two domains. The pebble  cairns thus represented conceptual entry points into an ancient dry river  bed associated with the ancestral dead and their ultimate journey to a  nether world beyond and beneath the sea. Thus the pebble cairns were monuments and memorials to the  memory of the ancestral dead and the old dead river of pebbles associ-  ated with them, while the river Exe became the medium by means of  which corpses of the vast majority of the recently deceased in the Bronze  Age could be moved and themselves transported, in a living river, to  another world beneath the sea. Here it is of interest to note that the   Otter flows out to the sea through a pebble bar laterally wedged between  red sandstone cliffs to both the west and the east, just as the Pebblebeds  are vertically wedged between red sandstone above and below them in  the Budleigh Salterton cliffs. By contrast the muddy and sandy mouth of   the Exe has no blood-r ed cliffs or pebbles bordering its exit to the sea.   The other world may have been conceptualized as a watery world under  the feet of the living, connected by ancestral and contemporary rivers  with the sea through which one entered it. Glimpses of the actual course   of the ancestral river to the sea were only visible in the cliffs at Budleigh   Salterton. Here a dry river of pebbles could be seen running through the   cliffs and disappearing into the pebble beach and the sea. Above this  Burnt mounds and peBBle sculptures 247 </page> <page sequence="59"> 248 river a layer of ‘burning’ (blackened strata with ventifacts) occurs, and  above this again a bright yellow band of sandstone perhaps associated  with the rays of the rising sun and thus symbolizing the regeneration   of life (Figure 1.8). The red cliffs themselves and their pebbles perhaps  provided inspiration both for the rituals taking place at the cairns and  the pebble platforms and those involving the burning and crushing of  the pebbles at Jacob’s Well, situated just below and to the west of the  heathlands, closest to the Exe and from which the setting (death) of the  sun was visible but not its rising (birth).  The old, dead or ancestral river is seen flowing through the cliffs  and running downwards, west to east, in the direction of the rising sun,  before reaching the sea. It narrows, rather than widens at its lowest point   where it reaches the sea. By contrast the Exe and Otter rivers both flow  north– south and widen in their lower reaches before they enter the sea.  The relation between these two watery rivers and the dead ancestral  river thus involves a triple inversion, or reversal, in terms of materiality,  directionality and breadth. Thus the domain of the dead was an upside-  down existence compared to that experienced by the living. 248 landscape in the longue durée </page> </plain_text>
