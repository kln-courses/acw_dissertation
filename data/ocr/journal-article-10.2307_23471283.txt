<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sha'ar Ha-Golan - 1997 Yossi Gatfinkel In June-July 1997 the fourth season of excavations was conducted in the Yarmukian village of Sha'ar Ha-Golan (see HA 108). The excavation was directed by Y. Garfinkel on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, with the assistance of G. Rosenberg (surveying), A. Barzilai (geomorphology), and B. Hesse (archaeozoology). The excavation area was enlarged from c. 360 to c. 750 sq m. In a limited sector of this area, in the east, an occupation level and a pit dating to MB I were revealed. Underneath this level and throughout the site's area, a stratum of the Yarmukian (Pottery Neo lithic) settlement was exposed. The excavation of the monumental structure, partially cleared last season, was completed, and that of two additional structures—also of considerable size—extending to its west and east was begun. The monumental structure (c. 400 sq m; Fig. 59) consists of a large central courtyard, triangular in plan, and eight surrounding rooms. One of the rooms is round, and conceivably served as a silo. Three of the rooms were paved with basalt cobbles. This struc 31*</page><page sequence="2">turc is the earliest courtyard house hitherto discov ered in the country. A broad and straight street, which was exposed last season, adjoins the structure in the west. A narrow alley ains alongside the structure on its east. On the western side of the street, the expo sure of a monumental structure, sections of which were already excavated in the 1989—1990 seasons resumed. On its floor were numerous artifacts in situ■, it appears that its tenants abandoned it unex pectedly, with the intention of returning. East of the alley, the exposure of another monumental structure commenced. Thus far, a large courtyard containing various installations and pits, as well as a small portion of a rectangular room, has been cleared. The abundance of finds this season includes sherds and flints characteristic of the Yarmukian culture. Various ait objects were also recovered: a clay figurine in the shape of a woman (Fig. 60), zoomorphic clay figurines, a fragment of an anthropomorphic pebble figurine, basalt pebbles incised with geometric patterns, and a fragment of an especially large statue made of baked clay, of which the head and one foot were preserved.</page></plain_text>
