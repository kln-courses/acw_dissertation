<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter Vardy. God of Our Fathers? Do we Know What we Believe? Pp. ix+ 124. (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 1987.) ?3.95. The double-barrelled interrogative of the title and sub-title is not a good indication of what Peter Vardy's book is about. The important question of the continuity of our religious beliefs with those of 'our fathers' is only implicit in the argument - and presumably the beliefs of our mothers are not as well documented ! The subtitle looks like an attempt to give popular appeal to what is in fact a discussion - a fresh and helpful discussion - of some of the standard questions in the philosophy of religion. What we believe about God is the central concern of Vardy's argument, and in the course of it he relates philosophical approaches to the questions of miracle, prayer, eternal life, evil, religious experience, atheism and resurrection to a scheme of underlying concepts of God. Four concepts of God are identified, two realist and two symbolic. ( 1 ) The first realist concept of God is of him as personal and everlasting. This is biblical and anthropomorphic and is dominant in popular religion. (2) The second realist concept of God conceives him, as in Thomism, as timeless substance. It stresses divine transcendence and deploys analogy to speak of realities beyond our ken. (3) The first symbolic concept of God finds</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 399 the meaning of God within the Christian language game. It is reductionist, subjective and belongs within a community of belief. It is motivated as a theory by linguistic - and hence metaphysical - positivism. (4) The second symbolic concept of God is the one associated with R. B. Braithwaite, and which was recently expounded by Stewart Sutherland in his God, Jesus and Belief, where ' God ' symbolizes an existential commitment to certain values of which Christian theism has been historically the vehicle. This view is reductionist too, from the point of view of Christian theism, but it is 'objective' in a way that cannot be said of the linguistic view, in that it holds that the universe is so constituted as really to sustain those values, though not the theological beliefs to which traditionally they have been attached. Unlike the linguistic concept of God, this approach is not dependent on corporate believing but can serve as a philosophy for the individual in his solitariness. Its motive is not so much the epistemological one of the positi? vist veto on metaphysical assertions - though in Sutherland the Kantian bounds of knowledge are assumed - as the moral one that takes the problem of evil with radical seriousness and finds theological apologetic on this unacceptable. Vardy's two realist theologies are something of a procrustean bed for what are often subtle and sophisticated elaborations of the doctrine of God. Process theology is subsumed under the concept of God as personal and everlasting, though it would seem to me more appropriate to regard it, together with other forms of immanental theology, as an attempt to bridge the gap between the two realist concepts of God. The inadequacy of both concepts is due to their exaggerated transcendentalism. The analogy of the Incarnation suggests a model of a God who pours his creative life into the universe and works in a hidden way to accomplish his good purposes through the coopera? tion of human spirits who are created in the divine image. This approach may also help to reduce the problem of evil to more manageable proportions, as it involves the withdrawal of infantile projections of evil and good, which blame God for human wickedness and seek redress from a source outside of humanity. It lays the responsibility where it belongs, on the shoulders of us human beings and challenges us to promote good and overcome evil. I admit that still leaves the question raised by Dostoievsky and discussed by Vardy and Sutherland, of whether creation is worth the pain involved - whether the game is worth the candle. But I would have thought that one does not have to be a professed Kantian to acknowledge that that is a question that we cannot answer. Vardy could have made a third category of realist theologies - a sophisticated immanental theism such as we find in contem? porary Roman Catholic theologians such as Rahner, K?ng and Schille beeckx, who in this respect have taken up the legacy of Schleiermacher. In his final chapter Vardy gently slips into the role of defender of the faith, suggesting that what is believed about the resurrection of Jesus is what</page><page sequence="3">400 RELIGIOUS STUDIES separates the realist sheep from the reductionist goats. If we believe that Jesus 'survived death as an individual with his existing memories', we can hold to one of the realist theologies, notwithstanding all their difficulties, and call ourselves Christians ; if not, not. By insisting on belief in Jesus being raised with his existing memories, Vardy is postulating resurrection, not just immortality. He concludes that anyone who does not accept this inter? pretation of the destiny of Jesus, but nevertheless continues to believe in 'God', must stand with Sutherland. This seems to me both to underestimate the flexibility of Christian theism and to credit Sutherland's position with a realism that it does not intend. I could envisage a form of Christian faith - albeit shot through with tragedy - in which the outcome of the death of Jesus was not seen as different from that of other human beings (and this solidarity would be significant) : a moral victory over evil, a sacrifice of one's life in the cause of God which is the cause of humanity, the soul gathered to God with or without its memories. In my opinion, a person holding such views about the resurrection could still be a Christian believer, provided that he or she could affirm with St Paul that 'God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. Thus Incarnation (in some sense), rather than resurrection, would be the touchstone and what is believed about the resurrection would be brought into line with what many already believe about the virginal conception. As these reflections demonstrate, Peter Vardy's book contains questions and tentative assertions to provoke much discussion. It should prove useful in seminar work, group discussion in enlightened parishes, as well as for personal study. I missed from the select bibliography the helpful writings of H. D. Lewis and H. P. Owen on these subjects. Paul Avis</page></plain_text>
