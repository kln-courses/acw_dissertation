<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Reflections on the Particular Characteristics of the Russian Historical Process* By Marc Szeftel THIS topic is in itself an invitation to generalize-a danger- ous enterprise on principle, but particularly dangerous for a historian conscientious of his obligations to the truth in the presentation of the past. This presentation should be pursued in the spirit of detachment and strict objectivity, while general- izing thwarts it by several temptations, especially if history of a contemporary nation is investigated. First of all, there is the temptation of anthropomorphism which makes one look upon the history of a nation as if it were a biography of an individual. It may lead very far, as far as psychoanalysis of a nation in terms of a "pattern of culture" which may be construed either as an original blessing or an original sin. This hints at a second temp- tation, that of the "manichaean" approach which identifies one nation with good, and another with evil (the evil nation is usually the antagonist of one's own nation). This black and white approach may also lead very far from actual reality. The third temptation is that of anachronism. It carries over into the past concepts and definitions of the present, or assumes as con- tinuing phenomena those long foregone. Thus, nationalism has been given a much older ancestry than historical facts have been warranting, and, on the other hand, "feudalism" has continued *Address read before the Conference on Slavic and East European History at the Annual Meeting of the American Historical Association, held in Philadelphia in December 1963. 223</page><page sequence="2">The Russian Review to be spotted as late as our own century. Connected with these three temptations is, finally, the fourth, that of pragmatism, to study the history of a nation in order to justify a policy or an action. While knowledge of the past of an antagonist, individual or nation, is a most useful documentation, the considerations of the present impede the objective understanding of this past, if the latter is studied primarily with an eye to an action. Here it would be useful to recall Henri Pirenne's insistence on the necessity for a historian of descending in his inquiry chrono- logically with the natural course of time, once the object of historical study had been located, and not ascending backwards toward the time of this study (which is the social scientist's method). In his own words: "The historian does not look to the past for the understanding of the present, but uses his knowledge of the present to understand the past." There are also other pitfalls in generalizations. To avoid all of them, generalization will not be the purpose of this address, nor any reflection on generalizations formerly made. This atti- tude is the more advisable in that it is difficult to find another national history in regard to which so many generalizations have been made as the history of Russia. Favorable generalizations, and hostile ones, of all kinds have been propounded both by Russians and non-Russians, so that as of now, there is hardly an idea which has not already been expressed in that vast "his- toriosophical" literature. Some of those ideas have little docu- mentation, some have much, but not a single one is based on complete documentation, and most of them have been formu- lated by authors who did yield with enthusiasm to one or all of the temptations described. They offer conversational, philo- sophical or psychological interest, but most of them do not add much to our historical knowledge of the Russian past. If gen- eralizations should be shunned in all historical research, there is still more reason to avoid them in the field of Russian history. In this spirit a more concrete historical analysis seems to be 224</page><page sequence="3">Reflections of the Russian Historical Process the only secure choice for this address. It will pertain to the cultural history of Russia as compared with that of Western and Central Europe. Chronologically, the seven centuries between the Christianization and Peter I's reform will provide the frame. Topically, the basic principles recognized as noncon- troversial will be studied. To avoid all possible misunderstand- ing, the study will be pursued within the territorial limits of the Great Russian ethnic group. The demographical basis of the latter were the populations which at the time of the Chris- tianization inhabited the Suzdal, Novgorodian and Riazan ter- ritories, then parts of the Kievan Rus. Between the twelfth and eighteenth centuries the Great Russian race extended from there northwards, eastwards, and southwards to spread finally over most (but, by no means, all!) of the Tsardom of Muscovy. Thus, the scope of this study will be gradually broadened geo- graphically from the aforementioned three Rus to the whole Great Russia as of 1699. Placed in the context of European cultural history, the pre- viously referred to seven centuries fall into two major epochs, that stretching from the Christianization of Rus to the middle of the fifteenth century, and then the epoch from the latter date to the end of the seventeenth century. The former epoch parallels in part the Western Middle Ages, the latter parallels the first two centuries of "new Europe," to use B. H. Sumner's term,1 or otherwise the Early Modern Ages. I. If one considers the "medieval"2 period of Russian history as a whole, one is struck by fundamental features differentiating 'Cf. B. H. Sumner, "Russia and Europe," posthumously published in Oxford Slavonic Papers, vol. II, Oxford 1951, p. 9. 2This term is used here only in the sense of chronological parallelism. From the point of view of parallelism of evolution, the term "Russian Middle Ages" may cover a different period: Alexandre Eck, in his Le Moyen Age Russe, Paris, 1933, has identified it as covering the centuries between the end of Kievan Rus in the thirteenth century and the final consolidation of Muscovy at the end of the sixteenth century. 225</page><page sequence="4">The Russian Review it from that of Western and Central Europe. They resulted to a great extent from the specific origin of Russian Christianity, which stemmed from Constantinople and not from Rome. Even as early as the end of the tenth century, before the great schism, important differences existed between the Greek East and the Roman West in two respects: (1) the way the Church looked upon its relations to the lay national power in the Christian countries and (2) the vehicle of evangelization among the peo- ples whose native language was neither Latin nor Greek. In the West, the Church claimed to be placed above national powers represented by kings and other rulers. There was no different national Church from country to country, everywhere there was the same Church of Rome, headed by the same spirit- ual leader, the bishop of Rome, the Pope. Its power was inter- national, and even cosmopolitan, if one accepts the definition of "cosmopolitan" as indifferent to separate and often conflict- ing national interests. The clergy of different countries, ruled (with the exception of the Papal state) from abroad, could even follow a path of policy entirely opposed to that of their mon- archs. Hence, conflicts of the secular (national) and spiritual (international) powers in the history of Roman Catholic coun- tries which, on many an occasion, led to clashes and violent showdowns. In the East, the Christian Church had no single head to obey.3 The only common authority recognized by all Eastern Christians was the Oecumenical Council, but since 787 A.D. (and down to our day) national councils alone were gathered. Thus, no extra-national power existed to oppose the national power within each nation in the name of an extra-national spiritual policy. The national lay power had to solve the problem of conciliation only regarding its own national Church, while the 3This was true not only for -the whole oikoumene of Eastern liturgy, but even for the Byzantine empire as such, where the Patriarch of Con- stantinople was only one of the four Eastern Patriachs. 226</page><page sequence="5">Reflections of the Russian Historical Process latter normally had no outside spiritual force to rely upon for protection and direction.4 The result was symbiosis instead of competition, and mutual support of the two powers; no struggle for investiture, such as in the West, no claims on the part of the Church to govern the State, no appeal to the population in the name of God against its lay rulers. This mutual peace may be considered as beneficial, but there was a negative counterpart. Since no international spiritual power challenged the primacy of the state, no ideological discus- sion of the limits of state power developed, while in Western Europe such discussion led to far-reaching philosophical results, recognized by some writers as the very fountainhead of the civil rights pertaining to the freedom of opinion.5 Toward the very end of the fifteenth century, during the controversy on monastic property, elements of such an ideological discussion appeared also in Muscovy, but in a different historical and spiritual climate they never developed into a permanent doc- trine.6 The method of Christianization was also different in the Western Church as against the Eastern Church. The Church of Rome knew only one liturgical language. This was Latin, and to newly Christianized populations speaking a Germanic or a Slavic language, the Roman clergy brought prayers and books of liturgy those populations could not understand, while the foreign clergy hardly understood the native language of those 4As long as the Metropolitan, the highest prelate of the Russian Church, was appointed by the Patriarch of Constantinople, the Russian clergy enjoyed a certain independence (this was especially true of the Klievan period). From 1448, however, the Metropolitan was elected locally by a synod of Muscovite Bishops, pending the creation of a Muscovite patriarchate in 1589. Cf. M.

The result was a culture in Latin everywhere, transcending national groups, but also alien to the mass of the people. A cultural split between the upper classes and this mass was produced all over Roman Catholic Europe, and it was overcome only at the end of the Middle Ages by the literary emancipation of the vernacular, Germanic or Slavic. This split was detrimental to the "horizontal" culture of the native popu- lations. Thus the pre-Christian folklore which the foreign clergy could not understand discriminately, was branded as a survival of paganism.7 In the East, the Greek missionaries followed a different policy of proselytism. To spread Christianity among the Slavic peoples of the Balkans and the valley of the Danube they translated the scriptures and the books of liturgy into Slavic. When Rus was Christianized, an important body of literature in Slavic was carried to it by the Christian clergy. This gave Rus at once a national literature in a language close to its spoken tongue. No cultural split occurred similar to that of Roman Catholic Europe between the upper classes and the mass of the people. The "horizontal" culture was not attacked by the clergy, for they knew the language of the people and could discern what was genuinely pagan from neutral elements in the Russian byliny, which thus survived the spread of Christianity. Next to these positive elements, the Greek origin of Russian Christianity contained, however, important shortcomings also in this respect. Although Constantinople in the tenth century was a higher cultural center than Rome, Christianization in Rus did not bring with it the reception of the cultural values of the Greek-Roman antiquity. In the West this was accom- plished through the vehicle of Latin; in Rus the vehicle was not Greek but the Church Slavic, and very little transmission took place. Only very few secular works were translated from Greek 70n the distinction between "horizontal" and "vertical" culture cf. W.

This scarcity of theological literature in Slavic can be explained by the practical and edifying purpose of the Slavic translations. The lack of contact with lay literature in Greek is to be explained by the characteristics of the Byzan- tine monasticism. The latter promoted prayer, physical labors and social charity, but not at all learning, and especially that leading to pagan sources. Indoctrination in Christianity did not mean at all for the Russians acquaintance with those sources, which were hidden, beyond their intellectual horizon, in the libraries of Constantinople or Salonika, and were practically absent from the monasteries of the Holy Mountain, where spir- itual direction was normally sought by the Russians.8 This brings us to another deficiency which resulted from the origin of Russian Christianity. Byzantine monasticism, espe- cially as developed in the Kievan Rus and later in the North- East, concealed powerful spiritual influences which, along with the direct imprint of the liturgy in Slavic and that of the trans- lated Holy Books, shaped the religious feeling of the Russian people with much innate warmth and humaneness. Still, the creative influence of the great monastic orders of the West was not there to promote intellectual development on the basis of classical learning. The whole of the literary production within the Russian monasteries had a practical, moral, religious char- acter; not even a dogmatic treatise was written. The only exceptions were the Chronicles which, to quote Fedotov, "vividly emphasize by their great artistic value, by contrast, the complete lack of scientific culture" (scientific is meant here in the broad sense of scholarly achievement) .9 Together with the Christian faith, the Canon law of the new 8G.

This prompted some writers to speak of the "reception of Byzantine law" by the Kievan Rus. This term, certainly, is exaggerated, for this "reception" was most selective and highly limited to those parts of the Byzantine legislation which directly concerned the Church.10 Since Byzantine law, whether Ecloga or Procheiron, was based to a great extent on the Corpus juris civilis, one may see in this borrowing the influence of Roman law. However, for reasons which one cannot examine here, there was not much creativeness in the Byzantine evolu- tion of Roman law, which, for all practical purposes, exhausted itself by the erection of the imposing structure of Justinian's Code. After that, there were some partial translations of the Corpus juris into Greek, some restatements (such as mentioned above) and, especially, abstracts, which led to other abstracts.11 Thus, one can hardly notice any influence of Roman legal con- cepts on Russian legal ideas and relations during the seven cen- turies preceding Peter I's reform. This influence, on the other hand, was very strong in Roman Catholic Europe; as it is gen- erally known, it promoted the idea of legality and contractual obligation, and that of the individual's autonomy as pater familias and property man. Was it the direct contact with Latin sources, besides terri- torial continuity, which may account for this influence? It seems to me that the Roman Catholic Canon law is also responsible for it to a great extent. This law, formulated in the same lan- guage as the Roman law, drew readily and consistently on the latter, and thus became a channel of transmission which did not exist in the East.12 Connected with it was the fact that a different 10Cf.

In the East, because of the prevalence of the conciliary principle, the Canon law was more rigid and conservative, and it was preserving the old rather than evolving in new directions. II. A closer contact with the Christian countries to the west of Rus could have corrected, to some extent, the deficiencies referred to; such a contact, however, became much more diffi- cult culturally toward the end of the eleventh century, when the great schism brought upon the final separation of Christian Europe into two hostile parts. This estrangement happened on the eve of important developments in Roman Catholic Europe, in which Rus did not participate. The monastic movement led to the foundation of new orders in Western Europe, whose ac- tion was varied and vigorous. In architecture, the Gothic style made its triumphal appearance. In religious art, sculpture (which was forbidden by the canons of the Greek Church) and painting produced during the four centuries following the schism innumerable masterpieces of various local schools. In philosophy scholasticism developed deductive thinking, and, within it, Thomism asserted itself. Political ideas developed, stimulated by the same State-Church conflict. The Canon law continued its reformulation of the Roman law in the sense of medieval ideas, and the Post-glossators created a new Roman law with the help of conceptual scholasticism and on the basis of materials provided by the Corpus juris civilis, the canonists and the local legislations.13 All this remained foreign to Rus. The isolation of the latter from Western Europe was magni- fied in the meantime by the effects of the Mongolian conquest of the North-Eastern Rus. It made final the disintegration of 13R.

The North-Eastern part of it became an "ulus" of the Golden Horde-the Suzdal and Riazan territories directly, and Nov- gorod indirectly, through its dependence on Vladimir. Outside of Novgorod, which continued the cultural life of the Kievan Rus, an all-round depression of standards set in for a century after 1240 A.D. Then, a painful recovery began to show itself in cultural accomplishments. It was, first of all, a resurgence and development of monastic life, pioneering economic expan- sion, and promoting spiritual endeavor. Then, literature and painting developed, spreading from Novgorod to a great extent. There was value in all of it, and sometimes greatness, but nothing compared to the contemporary blossoming of culture in Roman Catholic Europe. As we approach the late decades of the fifteenth century, one parallel development becomes evident. This is territorial and political centralization: a con- tinuous growth of a unified national state with the growing power of a national monarch. The parallel with Spain is espe- cially striking where, like Muscovy, this centralization came at the same time as the national liberation from the remnant of the foreign occupation (Moslem in both cases). This parallel development had its ideological implications: in both cases there was exaltation of the monarchical principle. III. At the same time, however, a "new Europe" was already creating its ultimate shape. The Renaissance was laying founda- tions for new secular cultures with the vernacular as a vehicle. The Russian culture had since the Christianization a literary idiom close to the vernacular as a means of expression, and here the Renaissance could not offer a new departure. However, the Muscovite culture was entirely ecclesiastical, more so than that of the earlier period. The lay principles of the Renaissance 232</page><page sequence="11">Reflections of the Russian Historical Process were totally unacceptable to it, while the centuries-old isolation from Roman Catholic Europe made cultural proselytism coming from suspect quarters hardly possible. Thus in the sixteenth century, in spite of the flowering of the Renaissance culture in neighboring Poland, Muscovy continued to pursue its medieval path, resisting all invitations to cultural change. In one respect only did the Renaissance affect Muscovy; this was the field of architecture, especially civil architecture, which completely transformed the Kremlin compound by the beginning of the sixteenth century; this was done, as is known, by Italian archi- tects. For other influences, there was no necessary background, for if the Renaissance meant a thorough reinterpretation of the Greek-Roman legacy in the spirit of secularism, this reinterpre- tation was based on the reassertion of that legacy. The first belated contacts with this aspect of the Renaissance appeared only as late as the second half of the seventeenth century, when with the annexation of Kiev Polish culture became influential in Muscovy. Another factor in the making of the "new Europe" was the Reformation, which meant a thorough reinterpretation of the Christian legacy.l4 Next to the Reformation, acting in a kind of a counterpoint, was the Counter-Reformation which pro- moted a more moderate religious reform in countries which rejected Protestantism; it was the Counter-Reformation which produced the Baroque and the Jesuits. Heresies of an evangelical or rationalist character appeared in the Novgorodian territory in the fourteenth century, and then again in the last decades of the fifteenth century. From there they spread to Moscow itself after the fall of Novgorod and became one of the elements of the crisis which at that time involved the State and the Church. After heresy was eliminated in the beginning of the sixteenth 140ur characteristics of the Renaissance and the Reformation follow to a considerable extent B.

Was there in those deviations any influence of Protestantism, coming from the neighboring Grand Princi- pality of Lithuania where the Reformation was very influential among the nobility? There is not enough evidence to answer this question positively. Anyway, the sixteenth century did not witness in Muscovy any social movement connected with Refor- mation, and no outstanding ideas in this direction were pro- pounded. In the seventeenth century there was no notable ex- ample of the influence of the Reformation in Muscovy in the field of religion; the raskol had, obviously, quite a different in- spiration. However, in the second half of the seventeenth cen- tury, the Polish cultural influence conveyed to the Muscovites by indirection ideas coming from the Reformation, although at that time the Reformation was already on the wane in the Polish territories. These ideas were not religious, but political; they can be traced especially to A. F. Modrzewski and they concerned natural law and the utilitarian idea of the State.'5 As to the Jesuits, their role during the Time of Troubles made their action hardly possible in Muscovy, even if there had been more religious tolerance. However, the annexation of Kiev opened Moscow also to this influence, again by indirec- tion. After 1596, in the Grand Principality of Lithuania and in the Polish Ukraine the Orthodox Church, in order to fight the inroads of Protestantism and Roman Catholic proselytism, adopted the Jesuit pattern for the training of its clergy. Then the clergymen invited from there to Muscovy carried with them their new learning obtained, above all, in the Kiev Theological Academy (e.g., Simeon of Polotsk or Sylvester Medvedev). An isolated example of direct Jesuit activity is provided by Juraj Krizanic whose political ideology was formulated during his long stay in Muscovy; it can also be related, in final analysis, to the 15Cf.

By the same Polish-Ukrainian channel the Baroque appeared in Muscovite architecture toward the end of the pre-Petrine period.16 Of the two other factors of the "new Europe," the transoceanic discoveries and the "scientific Revolution," the latter little affected Muscovy as of 1699. There was a great lag in this re- spect, for in some fields Muscovite ideas still reflected the state of mind characteristic of Byzantine thinking prior to the thir- teenth century. As to the movement of discoveries, Muscovy was affected by it, for it was the search for a passage to India that led Richard Chancellor to the White Sea in 1553, an event which resulted in the establishment of an economic contact between Muscovy and the English, and later on also the Dutch, contact which led to influences coming from the "German Suburb" in the seventeenth century.17 Whatever the effect of this "new Europe" on Muscovy, the latter did not participate actively in its preparation. The his- tory of the Renaissance, of the Reformation, of the Counter- Reformation, of the transoceanic discoveries and of the scien- tific revolution can be written without mentioning Muscovy in any essential connection. IV. During its centuries of isolation Muscovy evolved its own culture from the principles it took from Christian Byzan- tium and continued in its own way. As Weidle pointed it out with much insight, this culture was characterized by its "hori- zontal" strength and "vertical" weakness: wealth of folklore, but poverty of the literary patrimony; depth of religious feeling, but scarcity of theological thinking; masterpieces of architecture and painting, but no fully formed classical style; homogeneous culture of the mass of the people, but no structured upper culture of the small elite.l8 6OCf.

Weidle, op. cit., pp. 29-37. 235</page><page sequence="14">2The Russian Review What accounted for this weakness of "vertical" culture? It can be explained by the inarticulate character of the Muscovite elite due to the absence of the feudal system and the "corps intermediaires," and again by the fluidity of the population before its full fixation to social rank and the soil in the middle of the seventeenth century, a fluidity favored by the immense territorial space and its geographical features (a uniform plain hardly interrupted by mountains).19 We may add to this the question whether any "vertical" culture can develop under cir- cumstances of historical and foreign isolation-isolation from contemporary Western Europe and isolation from the perennial sources of the European culture, namely the Greek-Roman cultural legacy? The latter was not there in Muscovy to provide the foundation for the development of "vertical" culture, while the isolation from Western Europe did not allow for any com- pensatory evolution. Still, the second half of the seventeenth century was a period of slow, laborious building of "vertical" culture on bases general for the whole of Europe. It proceeded inch by inch against much resistance from the "horizontal" culture, when Peter I trans- ferred at once to Russia the whole of the cultural legacy of the West as of the beginning of the eighteenth century. This was a wholesale "reception" of the Western European "vertical" cul- ture in its secular aspects, and it meant a vigorous attack on the "horizontal" culture of the mass of the people, with all the power of the State enforcing the innovations. It was more than the upper class was ready to take voluntarily, but the former cen- tury prepared it for it, and it yielded to the State's cultural pros- elytism to such an extent that by the middle of the eighteenth century the new "vertical" culture became completely its own. Since then, and, most of all, since enlightened absolutism reached its climax in Russia under Catherine II, all cultural 19Cf. Weidle, op. cit., pp. 18-20, 23-26.

Russia even became an active and important partner of this development, with great contributions in all major fields of cultural activity. However, because of the violence of Peter I's reform, and also because of the long dura- tion of the isolation from Europe, the breach between the "verti- cal" culture of the educated society and the "horizontal" culture of the mass of the people (which existed everywhere in Europe!) became particularly deep in Russia, to such an extent that actu- ally two cultures opposed each other.20 Alexander II's Great Reforms, the industrialization that followed, but especially the social and educational growth characteristic of the Duma period, made the "vertical" culture slowly extend to the mass of the people, until the October Revolution drastically changed all premises of cultural life in Russia. 2QOn this cultural duality see Fedotov, Novy Grad, pp. 29-31, and again Sumner's comment, op. cit., p. 13. 237</page></plain_text>
