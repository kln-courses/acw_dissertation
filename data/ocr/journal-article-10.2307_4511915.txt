Serventy. 1972. Emu, 72: 41-50.-The history is divided into the periods of the early travellers, the great navigating expeditions, the pioneering settlers, the native-born observers, and the Modern period. This is a readable history derived from an address, and as such is deficient in the sort of references that would make the paper a source for detailed digging.-Jack P. Hailman. 66. A critical history of Emu. S. Marchant. Emu, 72: 51-69.-For the real history buffs, this paper by the Editor provides a full historical discussion of production, editors, policies, format, illustrations, notices and reviews, indexing, contents, and contributions. It should make good reading for anyone unfortunate enough to find himself with the responsibility of editing an ornithological journal, and, indeed, it might be of interest to potential authors as well.-Jack P.

(In English, sum- maries in Russian, French, German, and Slovakian.)-A general in ancient Rome was waiting for indications of success before setting out on a campaign, this to come through the holy augurs' interpretation of the temple birds' manner of feeding. The subjects being unresponsive, he exclaimed (or words to that effect): "Well, if they will not eat, perhaps they will drink," and threw the unfortunate fowl in the water. Modern bioclimatology would bring bird augury up to date by more varied observations. Here we ave an information-packed summary of many miscellaneous records of recent date. An "indicator" is defined as a con- clusion drawn of association between any organism or its population and any condition of the environment. According to biological statistics, an association implies some category of observations which tend to occur along with some other category of observations more often than can be ascribed to chance alone. The questions concerned here are: what do birds indicate, and how do birds indicate? The material is organized under eight topics: (1) weather and climate, discussed under various modes: wind and air currents, strong indication found in flights of swifts and swallows; barometric pressure, cyclones and precipitation, changes in climate; (2) soils and earthquakes; (3) water conditions and fishing; (4) landscape (biotic communities, ecosystems); (5) forest stands and their condition, including forest types, forest successions, conditions in groves or individual trees, i.e., whether aged or insect-infested may be indicated by birds present; (6) indication of (other) organisms, covers location of other species and their population level, e.g., Honeyguides' behavior, indicators of bark beetle occurrence in conifers, emigration as indication of seed crop failure; (7) pesticide indication, i.e., of birds as accumulators of pesticide residues, use of canaries to warn of gas in mines; and (8) as radioactivity indicators, i.e., radioactive accumulations in feathers, trans- portation of radionucleides. Following each of these topics is an extensive biblio- graphy. Pertaining to each topic more research is needed and even in progress. The one general method is plain and prolonged field observation with adequate record-keeping. Altogether this is a most remarkable ecological document.- Leon Kelso. 68. The Lovely and the Wild. Louise de Kiriline Lawrence. 1968. New York, McGraw-Hill Book Company. $6.95. 228p. This is a book about life, about all forms of life: red squirrels, snowshoe hares, least flycatchers. Mrs. Lawrence's reverence for the land and its creatures mark this as a work following in the tradition of Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac.</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 43, No. 4 Recent Literature [305 Mrs. Lawrence is a self-taught naturalist. Her learning experiences are freely related throughout the early chapters. She moves away from an early con- ception of nature "red in tooth and claw" toward an intense interest in animal behavior and a gradual understanding of ecology. Throughout the book she clings to the fight or flee dichotomy as an overused explanation for most everything. " . I began to take notes, naively written as if I were speaking to the birds directly.... This seemed to lead us, the birds and me, into a more intimate re- lationship. It also led me into an entirely anthropomorphic appreciation of the birds and their behavior. But for a long time I remained blissfully ignorant of even the existence of that long word and certainly of its meaning and the impedi- ments it posed to the art of objective observation." She never really escapes her anthropomorphic tendencies, although she later minimizes them and, despite all, her observations are extraordinarily detailed, extraordinarily sensitive. Her use of the present tense to relate observations combines well with her descriptive abilities and attention to detail to give the reader a sense of making the observation himself. The change to past tense for interpretation or reflection lends a meditative, even wistful mood to the text. In addition to the fine text the book is amply and beautifully illustrated by Glen Loates. The pen and ink sketch- es, mostly of animals, convey a sense of warmth and vitality that alone is worth the price of the book. The book closes with a discussion of animal population trends about her home in the Pimisi Bay region of Ontario over the past 25 years. It is a discussion made all the more meaningful by the vivid pictures that have gone before. "Silent spring! Has Rachel Carson's prevision really come true? Let scientific research take care of the complexity of its causes. Here I am dealing only with a trend that in this one region emerges with convincing insistence from the events I have observed and recorded over the past two and a half decades. If by silent spring we mean the stillness that has descended upon the forest where formerly the voices of the woodland birds used to fill the dawn and the morning hours with their continuous and varied chorus, then, indeed, Rachel Carson's silent spring is upon us today, a portentous reality."-Edward H. Burtt, Jr. 69. The morphology of the syrinx in passerine birds. P. L. Ames. 1971. Peabody Mus. Nat. Hist. Bull., 37: 1-194.-The long awaited publication of Ames' Ph.D. dissertation on the passerine syrinx will be greeted with mixed feelings by avian morphologists and systematists. On the one hand, the paper is undoubtedly the most comprehensive survey of the structure of the avian syrinx to be published, and his conclusions will be cited by many future workers. How- ever, many will probably find his discussions rough going because of poor organ- ization. Furthermore, because of the complexity of his presentation, many of his systematic and evolutionary conclusions will have to be viewed with measured skepticism until such time as they can be analysed in more detail. Before proceeding to my main comments, it should be pointed out that certain editorial policies apparently account for some of the problems encountered in the organization of Ames' paper. I refer especially to the placing of all the illustrations in plates at the end of the text. In numerous instances this will in- convenience the reader and prohibit efficient reading of the paper. Placing plates together might be necessary and justifiable with photographs but is questionable with line drawings such as used here. Ames begins with a brief history of syringeal morphology, methods of study, and nomenclature. The bulk of the paper follows these sections and includes a detailed description of the syrinx in the suboscines, with only eight pages being devoted to all the oscines. There are short sections on development, variations, and then a rather detailed summary of the morphology characteristic of each suboscine group. Finally, there is a brief review of passerine classification, an out-of-place section on adjectives of syringeal morphology ("-myodean," "tra- cheal," and "bronchial"), and sections on the evolution and taxonomic value of the syrinx. My first major criticism is that there is no general introduction to the paper. Why did the author undertake this study? Was his main goal descriptive, evolu- tionary, taxonomic, or all three? One has to wait until the section on variation (p. 100) before reading "Although the main purpose of this study is to establish relationships among genera and higher categories. . . ."
