GETTYS University of Texas ABOUT two years ago there ap- i-I Fpeared a volume of some Z50 ~~pages entitled Social Ecology by Milla A. Alihan. I Although the book was a devastating criticism of sociological theory it apparently attracted little atten- tion and provoked no great amount of discussion. This lack of interest may be attributed in large measure to the fact that the book deals specifically with human or social ecology, a theoretical system that, developed during the last twenty years or so, has been confined to a rather small group of scholars, and has produced no published work to speak of beyond nu- merous scattered articles in the journals, occasional papers read at the meetings of the American Sociological Society, and somewhat incidental treatment in a few introductory text-books in sociology. Despite this general lack of attention, Alihan's opening sentence in her Intro- duction reads: "The ecological school is one of the most definite and influential schools in American Sociology at the present time." Whether or not such a statement exaggerates the importance of human or social ecology may be left to others and the future to decide. It is sufficient to point out that, as a theoreti- cal system and a research method, human ecology is deserving of more attention than it has yet received and that a critical appraisal of and strictures against its basic hypotheses, conceptual structure, and fundamental conclusions, such as Dr. Alihan has written, can not be passed lightly by. It may be said, in passing, that Dr. Ali- han has performed a meritorious service in the interest of social science research methods and the formulation of logical and valid social theory. While her critique of the ecological school is almost entirely negative, it is not malicious. To point out mistakes is not to correct them to be sure, and to examine is not to ex- plain. Nevertheless, a fair, unbiased crit- icism, supported by copious documenta- tion, may serve to stimulate the scientists, in this case the social ecologists, to re- examine their theoretical framework and to give it a more careful statement. Like- wise, scholars in other schools of social thought may be aroused to the crying need for a more continuous investigation of theories, refinempnt of concepts, and scru- tiny of research methods growing out of repeated tests of their adequacy and valid- ity. If Dr. Alihan succeeds in some measure in accomplishing this end, she * Read at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, December 29, I939. 1 Published by Columbia University Press, New York, I938. 469</page><page sequence="2">470 SOCIAL FORCES will have achieved her expressed purpose very well. This paper is not intended as a review of the Alihan treatise. These preliminary remarks are merely meant to serve as a point of departure for what is admittedly no more than a rather adumbrated state- ment of what it seems to the writer may be regarded as approximating an adequate and meaningful approach to socio-ecologi- cal theory. That there is need for some such statement is clearly indicated. One of the first considerations in the construction of a theoretical system is that of hypotheses. As Alihan has pointed out and as the ecologists have admitted, practically all of their basic hypotheses have been derived from natural science sources.2 It does not seem to do violence to the ecological position, as in- dicated repeatedly in the literature, to say that "human" ecology as we are given to know it by those who have written about it, stems largely from the physiological writings of C. M. Child and from plant and animal ecologies.3 The influence of Allee, Clements, Warming, W. M. Wheeler, and others is avowed. The Darwinian formula appears extensively throughout the theoretical framework of the school,4 and the influence of certain geographers and economists is apparent.5 In spite of statements in the literature to the contrary, there is considerable evidence that the ecologists hold to a theory of biological and/or geographic determinism in human affairs. In other words, men and their institutions are represented as being spatially, temporally, and occupationally distributed by the operation of forces either inherent in the biological nature of man or existing ex- ternal to man in the so-called "natural world";6 symbiosis as applied to plants and animals is regarded as a term equally or similarly, if not always identically, applicable to man and human groupings;7 competition, or competitive-selection, is treated largely as a manifestation of a universal and immutable struggle for ex- istence and of a process of "natural" selection;8 the so-called "biotic equilib- rium" is defined as the "natural balance between numbers and resources, resulting in a relatively stable spatial and sus- tenance relation, found in almost all isolated people, no matter what phase of 2 E.

Frequent reference to his writings, as well as to those of E. W. Burgess and R. D.

In an apparent attempt to effect some sort of reconciliation between man, the animal, and man as a human being and the possessor of culture, the "hu- man" ecologists adopted a familiar device, namely, the dichotomy. Dichot- omizing is not unique, of course, with the biologists and the ecologists; it is a common affliction of the social sciences. Illustrative of the dichotomies employed extensively by the ecologists are those of "community" and "society," "indi- vidual" and "person," "natural" and "cultural," "biotic" and "social," "eco- logical order" and "social order," "eco- logical (competitive) interaction" and "'social interaction." Careful examina- tion of these and similar contrasting cate- gories reveals them to be largely arbitrary, artificial, and erroneous. That their parts are frequently represented as being to some degree interdependent and inter- related does not serve to bridge the gaps set up between them. In their usage the ecologists have displayed conspicuous in- consistency and inaccuracy; they have contributed to obfuscate thinking rather than to clarify it. Dichotomies, such as those mentioned, tend to disappear when it is recognized that culture, in its varied and multi-forms, wherever found, together with human mo- tives of great number and variety, influ- ence, condition, and even in some instances, determine where and by what means people shall live; that so-called symbiotic relations among human beings are not immune to the influences of choice, taste, initiative, desire, and customary and institutional controls; that compe- tition is not free and unrestrained, par- ticularly among the more civilized peoples; that the equilibrium, designated as "biotic," is very much a matter of agricultural and industrial methods, tech- nological achievements, systems of eco- nomic distribution, dietary practices, sanitation, development and application of medical knowledge, conscious family limitation, and war-making tendencies. Modern cultural anthropology has sup- plied us with an abundance of factual material tending to disprove the notion 9 A. B. Hollingshead, in An Outline of the Principles of Sociology, p.

Quite unrealistic has been the not incon- siderable borrowing from and the draw- ing of analogies with plant and animal ecology by the "human" ecologists. A concept centrally placed in the conceptual structure of human ecology is that of "'community." Contrasted with "com- munity" is that other concept of dubious meaning, "society.' '14 While these terms are usually used in a specific sense, they are sometinmes used interchangeably. "Community" as a valid ecological con- cept is generally represented as being in its essentials analogous to the so-called plant community,'5 a crude anthropomorphism of the plant ecologists. That is to say, "community" is stripped down until it remains barren of all those qualities con- sidered social. Piecing together fragmen- tary definitions we are led to conclude that "community" is essentially a popu- lation, territorially distributed and ar- ranged, "rooted in the soil," and having its individual units living in a sym biotic relationship (state of mutual interdepend- ence) with each other. Paradoxically, it is devoid of communication and consensus. It is characterized by competition on the level of struggle for existence, very much as it is found on the plant and animal level, except as modified "among the less isolated peoples" by "society," which is represented as a kind of superstructure imposed upon "community.''l6 The dif- ficulty here lies chiefly in the arbitrariness and illogicality of the distinctions made in dichotomizing, and in the misleading character of the analogies actually stated and those implied. Further, in the di- chotomy under consideration, as well as in the others previously mentioned, the ecologists commonly represent the second part of each dichotomy as symbolizing something of a higher order than the first part, the former as something superim- posed upon the latter, thus representing a dualism of "society" on two levels- "biotic society" and "cultural society."''7 Are these two different kinds of society, as we might well be led to believe, or are they merely two different and rather gen- eralized aspects of society as a whole?'8 One more point in this connection. The bifurcation of the processes of inter- action into ecological and social is forced and misrepresentative of the facts of ex- perience.'9 As experienced, they belong together and are inseparable. For pur- poses of analysis, there may be some justification for this and similar dichot- omies, but it should be rememnbered that analysis is the beginning of understand- ing, and that synthesis according to some valid scheme is the end.

In other words, they have not developed a complete and logical theo- retical system. They have presented nu- merous hypotheses, gleaned mainly from the "natural" sciences and principally from the biological sciences, and these fragmentary gleanings have been set up as postulates from which we are asked to construct a science or sciences of human actions and relationships. The usual second step in scientific pro- cedure is to test hypotheses by means of factual studies. Acting upon the assump- tion that our hypotheses are significant and workable, we begin the task of col- lecting, selecting, collating, classifying, summarizing, and generalizing data that seem pertinent to the purpose we have in mind. For this task several methods will be employed-those for gathering the data and those suitable for the manipulation of those data. Human ecology has been hailed in cer- tain quarters as having made an important contribution to so-called quantitative sociology. In other words, it is held that perhaps its greatest contributions have been methodological and factual. In some significant respects this conten- tion is eminently true,20 in other respects the results of the application of ecological methods and techniques are disappoint- ing.21 Without undertaking to evaluate the results of ecological research as to their methodological importance beyond the point of indicating that their values, how- ever great they may be in themselves, are derived from concrete studies too narrowly confined to a single and somewhat unique area, namely, the large American city, we shall proceed to the third step in the de- velopment of a scientific system-the formulation of a conceptual and theoreti- cal framework. Such conceptual and theoretical generalizations should be de- rived inductively and should grow natu- rally and logically from the factual studies. That this is not generally true in human ecology is undoubtedly one of its greatest weaknesses. Ideally, the testing of ten- tative theoretical hypotheses by whatever methodological techniques prove feasible and serve the purpose for which they are intended should be followed by the emer- gence of conclusions that either verify or deny or modify the original hypothetical propositions, these conclusions being ca- pable of formulation into statements of generalized principles or laws. These, in turn, become hypotheses subject to further testing by step-by-step systematic proce- dures, each one being carefully reproduced, checked, and verified. It is the conten- tion of the critics of the ecological school that so far most of its concepts and gen- eralizations have not been so defined and derived. The difficulty, it would seem, lies not so much with faulty methods as it does with inconsistent and biased theoreti- cal assumptions, too many a priori con- clusions, and discrepancies between the theoretical formulations and the factual observations. So incisive has been the criticism of Alihan and others of the theoretical po- sition of the human ecologists that one might be led to doubt if any value could possibly inhere in such a system of theory. 20 Relatively few studies of a distinctly ecological character have been published. Researches that have some socio-ecological significance, albeit in an incidental way, include numerous ones in the fields of demography, human geography, regionalism, economic history, and urban and rural community organization. 21 Cf. J. H. S. Bossard, in a review of Milla A. Alihan, Social Ecology, American Sociological Review, 4, pp. ii9-izo; Frank A. Ross, "Ecology and the Statistical Method," American Journal of Sociology, XXXVIII, 507-522.</page><page sequence="6">474 SOCIAL FORCES Certainly a thorough-going revision and restatement of ecological theory is called for. This is a task to the performance of which the human ecologists should im- mediately set themselves. All that may be involved in the process is not presently clear, but the general direction and form it may presumably take is rather definitely indicated. It must suffice here to merely state, more or less tentatively, some of the criteria which may serve as guides in the recasting process. First, it must be decided with definite- ness and with greater finality than at present what phenomena will fall within the scope of "human" ecology. This will call for a more exact and precise definition of the field. If the discipline is to retain its present designation of "human" ecology, or is to be identified as social ecology, manifestly it should con- fine itself to the investigation of essen- tially "human" and/or "social" data. If it is to be "ecology" then it should approach the ecological study of these data in terms given in the data themselves rather than from the point of view, the conceptual connotations, and the some- times questionable assumptions of the plant and animal ecologies. Stated some- what differently, "human" ecology must free itself from i ts primary dependence upon organic ecology, thus obviating the dangerous dichotomies, questionable analogies, necessary modifications and equivocations, the over-straining of con- cepts, and the fantastic theoretical impli- cations and claims with which it is now burdened. If "human" ecology, so liber- ated, will concentrate on the study of the distributive aspects of human beings and their institutions by methods suited to such material and then analyze and inter- pret its data in terms of its ecological conceptual scheme, it may well make a place for itself among the social sciences and beyond the criticism of its friends and the mockery of its detractors. Secondly, and related to what has just been said, there is the necessity for de- termining whether "human" ecology is to be a social science discipline or largely an appendage to biological ecology. This point is raised not for the purpose of merely quibbling; it is one forced upon us by the ecologists themselves. Ac- cording to them "the two fundamental aspects of human organization" are "coin- munity" and "society." "So distinct are they," says Alihan, "that the ecolo- gists assign each category to a different discipline. 'Community' is regarded as the subject matter of human ecology, while 'society' is included in the scope of social psychology."22 Regardless of the fact that the concepts are frequently treated by the ecologists as overlapping and even interchangeable, the formal dis- tinction remains valid. This being the case, "community" is the major concept in the conceptual framework of "human" ecology, and "society," an equivocal term at best, is regarded as a nonecological con- cept. Actually, the ecologists do not limit their studies to "community," so defined, but weave back and forth across the boundary line of their own making. If they had confined their theoretical as- sumptions and conclusions and their re- searches to "community" in the sense in which they first borrowed the concept from biological ecology they would be biological ecologistsand not "human" or "social" ecologists. As it is, by walking with one foot in the gutter and the other on the curb, they have tended to create a sort of hybrid discipline, very much on the order of the now discredited organis- mic sociology, which "human" ecology resembles in certain marked respects. 22 Milla A. Alihan, op. cit., p. iI.</page><page sequence="7">HUMAN ECOLOGY AND SOCIAL THEORY 475 Since the leading human ecologists, at least in America, are sociologists seeking to develop sociology into a "natural" and exact science, they, like some of their predecessors, turned to the spatial scheme of human geography, the spatio-temporal framework of classical mechanics, the specifically distribution theories of eco- nomics, and principally to the plant and animal ecologies for similarities and paral- lels between the physical and concrete elemenlts and processes in these other fields, on the one hand, and "the less evolved aspects of human life" in the human community, on the other. It is to be questioned seriously if such obvious dependence on the "natural" sciences has contributed constructively to the development of a science of "human" ecology. It has, rather, made for con- fusion, distortion of facts, illogical de- ductions, crude anthropormorphization, and fantastic attempts to synthesize in- compatible physical and social factors. The borrowing of terms is not unique and is not, in itself, a serious offense; but the drawing of analogies that are farfetched and inaccurate is less excusable. The human community, as a social entity, and regarded in its spatial and distributive as- pects, is an observable and experiential phenomenon, worthy of scientific in- vestigation in its own right, without the student having to concern himself with the "naturalness" or the "unnaturalness" of the phenomenon. The sooner we cease considering such things as fauna and flora, neurons and protons, chemical elements and physical processes as uniquely "nat- ural," and such things as Fersons, families, attitudes, values, folkways and mores, language and communication, and the like, as "unnatural," and the more promptly we in the social sciences rid ourselves of our sense of inferiority in comparison with those working in the physical and biological sciences, the more readily will the invidious and fallacious bifurcation of the sciences into the "natural" and the "unnatural" dis- appear. And, accordingly, will our tend- ency to lean upon and draw from the so- called "natural" sciences diminish and we will become more self-reliant, inventive, and scientifically productive. If human ecology will center its atten- tion upon the description, measurement, analysis, and explanation of the spatial and temporal distribution of social and cultural data it may become in truth a significant social science discipline. Hu- man ecology will be, then, not a meta- physical apology for a monistic view of man's sustenance relations with other men, but the scientific study of man's social adjustment behavior as affected by and in turn conditioning his distribution in space and time. Thus, limited in its scope and freed from its present naturalis- tic assumptions and implications, its irrel- evancies and discrepancies, "human" ecol- ogy will be social ecology, capable of developing a theoretical system consistent with the facts that are the recognized object-matter of its researches and the touchstones of its theoretical formula- tions. Finally, once having achieved an es- tablished position as a scientific discipline with a "unity between theory and facts, between doctrine and methods, and be- tween approach and conclusions derived from factual analysis,''23 it will remain to be decided what relation social ecology is to have with the larger body of social theory. Although it would be premature to attempt to reach a decision at this time, it may not be amiss to venture some con- jectures on the matter. Historically, what has come to be 23 Ibid., p. 2.52.</page><page sequence="8">476 SOCIAL FORCES known in the United States as human ecology has been closely associated with the development of sociology, particularly as the latter subject has advanced in the last quarter of a century from one of broad philosophical generalizations to one more largely characterized by the empirical ap- proach and more refined research tech- niques. Perhaps it has been unfortunate for human ecology that it has been thus intimately identified with sociology dur- ing a most critical period in the latter's history. If sociology as a discipline had not been suffering from a plurality of diverse theories, a confusion of concepts, a multiplicity of techniques, and variant trends, but had, on the contrary, presented a more harmonious and unified approach and the unity of an integrated theoretical scheme, human ecology, as one of the youngest of the sociological systems, might have fared better. Perhaps it is too much to expect of human ecology that it achieve order and system within itself as long as its parental discipline remains in a state of relative chaos. If it were to develop into a logical and coherent theo- retical system in its own right, it would of necessity-by reason of its limited scope and the selected nature of its data-have to be integrated into a larger and more inclusive theoretical framework or find its place as a borderline field among the social sciences. Since sociology, in its present disjointed and immature state, does not seem to be very rapidly approach- ing the stature of a clearly defined and definitely refined special social science, occupying a certain and secure position in the scientific world, and since the kind of social ecology projected in this paper will, if realized, constitute a rather specialized subsystem of a larger and more inclusive system of social theory, it is anticipated that social ecology will naturally take its place in the hierarchy of sciences as a borderline discipline somewhat akin to social psychology and social economics in the essentially social field and to physi- cal chemistry and bio-chemistry in the fields of the physical and biological sci- ences.</page></plain_text>
