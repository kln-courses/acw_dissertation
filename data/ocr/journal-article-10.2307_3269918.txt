After more than three decades of intensive study on a large array of problems in the history of western monasticism, and in particular of research on its classical sources, Dom de Vogiil has embarked upon a very ambitious project. He intends to retrace the early steps of the move- ment in its self-perception and self-definition (although he himself is too much of a classicist to use such terms) through a close reading of its main literary documents. The result is a magisterial lesson, which will become imperative reading for anyone in the field. De Vogii6 starts by acknowledging his intellectual debts and the great tradition which he intends to follow. An histoire littiraire, he states rightly, differs from both a Geschichte der Literatur and from history tout court. The value of De Vogii6's method is directly related to his deep, intimate knowledge of the texts. This knowledge, which commands great respect, entitles him to draw-although he denies doing so-important conclu- sions from the texts to the reality which lies behind them. As de Vogii6 states in his introduction, his interest in monasticism is existential before it is scientific. His results show that the former only strengthens the latter. Through such a close reading of texts, he is able to perceive even slight semantic changes and call attention to the turning points in the early history of the movement, or rather of the self-perception of monks in antiquity. There is, however, a problem with this method, and it should be recog- nized and spelled out from the outset. The problem lies precisely with the very authority conveyed by de Vogfii's voice. It is his voice, yet it claims to reproduce the essence of monasticism itself, as it is reflected in fourth century literature. Since de Vogfii's is as elegant as it is sound, it seduces us easily; in other words, his work is itself a piece of literature. But the Numen, Vol. XXXIX, Fasc. 2</page><page sequence="2">268 Book reviews fact that de Vogii has chosen to illuminate his texts mainly by other texts, with few references to works of modern scholarship, prevents readers not as well read as he is (and few are) to check the author's views for herself or himself. Footnotes are not only a pedantic business. They do provide guidelines as to the originality of claims, and some sense as to their sound- ness. I may give here at least one example. The author notes that from Antony to Jerome, monastic literature seems to get rid of the devil (p. 280). This is an extremely important insight. The lack of any further discussion, however, leaves the reader somewhat frustrated. I wish now to mention a few topics dealt with by de VogiiG which might be of special interest to historians of religion. The book focuses on the first literary documents of western monasticism, the two Latin translations of Athanasius' Vita Antonii, done within less than twenty years after it was written, in 356-357, and on Jerome's Epistles, in particular his Letter to Eustochium on virgnity and its three 'male' excursus. Hence the first topic of interest is perhaps the taxonomy of monasticism as perceived within a generation that saw the transformation of the movement from eremitism to coenobitism, and the 'recuperation' of the former by the latter. De Vogii6 is also sensitive to other sides of the ancient taxonomy. For instance, he dwells upon the ten- sions between urban clergy and the monks, or more broadly between "le christianisme mondain" and those religious radicals who not only populated the desert, but also conducted their ascetic fight at the borders of heterodoxy. The status of the monks was then ambiguous, as the author shows. The monks were not only admirable models of sanctity, living exempla, but also, more often than not, elicited instinctive repulsion on the side of many Christians. What was true of monks could also be said about nuns. De Vogii6 follows step by step the traces of the transformation, under the direct influence of the monks, of the consecrated virgins into nuns. He also points out the deep differences between Syrian and Egyp- tian monasticism: when the former is characterized by compunction, texts from the latter reflects the deep joy of life in Christ. De Vogii6 is able to point out the close connections of the ascetic move- ment not only with heterodoxy (see the numerous accusations of 'Manichaeism' thrown at the monks) but also with religious radical con- servatism, what would today be called 'int6grisme' (p. 204). This insight is of great interest for a phenomenology of monasticism (for which see already A. Guillaumont's works). One wishes the author had added a word on what one could call, to use another anachronistic word, the monks' 'fundamentalism', or simplistic beliefs, reflected for instance in the anthropomorphic conceptions common among Egyptian monks.</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 269 When dealing with monastic life as it is reflected in the literature, the author is able to make various insightful comments, including on realia: food habits, dress ("l'habit fait le moine", p. 403), living quarters, culture, sexual obsessions or the lack thereof. For him the essence of monasticism, beyond obvious asceticism, is the interiorization of Paul's 'prophetic message' (p. 65). Indeed, he shows throughout the book how deeply the early monks were concerned with psychological matters: con- version, moral progress, prayer. This insistence on interior life is, to my mind, what makes early Christian monasticism fascinating, and so fun- damentally different from its Essene 'model'. De Vogfii has given us a magnificent introduction into the world of the early monks. We eagerly await coming volumes. The Hebrew University GEDALIAHU G.
