<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLERIDGE AND THE ENERGY OF ASKING BY THOMAS M. GREENE I Among Coleridge's innumerable reflections on the symbol, one note- book entry is particularly suggestive: All minds must think by some symbols-the strongest minds possess the most vivid Symbols in the Imagination-yet this a want, rnoOov, desiderium, for vividness of symbol: which has something that is without, that has the property of Outness (a word which Berkeley preferred to "Externality") can alone fully gratify even that not fully- for the utmost is only an approximation to that absolute Union, which the soul sensible of its imperfection in itself, of its Halfness, yearns after.' The word "want" here presumably needs to be understood in two senses, both as a wish, corresponding to desiderium, and as a lack, correspond- ing to the soul's "imperfection." The wish apparently stems from the lack. Through the tangled syntax emerges a fresh idea: that the symbols common to all human minds, and all the more vivid in those highly gifted, are derivatives of a felt incompleteness. The presence of the vivid symbol signals a pressure to complete the soul with that which it desires, the outer world, or more simply "Outness." The symbol is a symptom of the yearning for a marriage or "absolute union" that alone could satisfy this buried but intense wish. The symbol is present within the mind, or more specifically the imagination, but it also possesses the property of appearing outside. It straddles the two halves of reality whose joining the soul desires. It approximates that absolute union which is denied finite humans. The symbol initiates a marriage that will remain unconsummated and thereby reminds the soul of its "Halfness." The soul resembles in fact one half of the Platonic androgyne, always in quest of its correspond- ing member and always in love with it. This notebook entry is one random jotting among thousands over a long career, an entry its author never chose to rework for publication. It deserves our attention only insofar as it can serve as an entry into the rest of his work. Setting aside for a moment the familiar importance of the symbol to the writer, I think that the "want" which the entry names does ELH 62 (1995) 907-931 h 1995 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 907</page><page sequence="2">point toward an essential pressure in Coleridge's labyrinthine mind. "Want" in his work becomes itself a symbol. More broadly, the sugges- tion that all imaginative writing derives from a certain experience of privation needs to be considered seriously. The entry quoted is most certainly not to be explicated by any crude biographical reduction. But it is worth recalling nonetheless that priva- tion in various concrete senses was an element that recurred in Coleridge's life. The experience of physical craving was already familiar from boyhood. By Coleridge's own account he and his fellow-students were perpetually hungry during his nine years at school in London: "Our diet was very scanty [at Christ's Hospital] ... Our appetites were damped, never satisfied.'"2 Elsewhere he writes of his "want of money all the first two or three and 20 years of my Life." (Notebooks, 2:2647). If one remembers his endless financial struggles, need could be regarded as a permanent fixture of his life, continuing at least until the move to James Gilman's house at the age of 44. There were periods when he com- plained of suffering literal privation. "It is a matter of the utmost Importance," he wrote to his friend Poole in March, 1801, "to be removed from seeing and suffering Want" (L, 2:388). Earlier that month, a letter to the same correspondent had personified the experience of privation as a mirror-symbol of the writer: "Tho' Poverty was staring me in the face, yet I dared behold my Image miniatured in the pupil of her hollow eye, so steadily did I look her in the Face!" (L, 2:387). This sounds as though Coleridge saw in the poverty of his outward circumstances a reflection of a personal vacuum, a double enemy which he felt it necessary to stare down. Here is a sinister image crossing from the soul to "Outness" and perfecting a union that the writer first tries to contemplate steadily and then wishes to flee.3 Coleridge's experience of privation extended to the most intimate of familial relationships. The first chapter of the Biographia Literaria refers to the author's "friendless wanderings" during school vacations and adds a parenthesis: "(for I was an orphan, and had scarce any connections in London)."4 The claim of orphanhood was literally untrue; although his father died when he was nine, Coleridge's mother did in fact live well into his adult years. But what evidence we possess suggests that after receiving intermittent favors in early life as the youngest of a large brood, the boy was cut off from his mother after the death of her husband. Thomas McFarland refers to her "coldness and inattentiveness," and Norman Fruman describes her as "unspeakably indifferent."5 The asser- tion of orphanhood, literally false, must have had considerable emotive content, and indeed the poetry reflects a yearning for the maternal 908 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="3">breast, even in the texts chosen for translation. The "Hymn to the Earth," translated from F. L. Stolberg, opens with an apostrophe to the earth-mother: "Earth! thou mother of numberless children, the nurse and the mother, / Hail!" and goes on to situate the speaker where the poet clearly wants to be: "Here, great mother, I lie, thy child, with his head on thy bosom!" (P, 1:327-28.1-2, 8). The "Monody . . . on Chatterton" evokes each knell from a spire sounding for the poet "like a seeking Mother's anxious call, / Return, poor Child! Home, weary Truant, home!" (P, 125.14-15). More telling still is the poet's decision to render in English a single passage from the long Latin metrical para- phrase of scripture by a certain Ottfried: She gave with joy her virgin breast; She hid it not, she bared the breast Which suckled that divinest babe! Blessed, blessed were the breasts Which the Saviour infant kiss'd;... Blessed, blessed! for she lay With such a babe in one blest bed, Close as babes and mothers lie! Blessed, blessed evermore, With her virgin lips she kiss'd, With her arms, and to her breast, She embraced the babe divine ... (P, 1:306.1-5, 13-19) Other maternal images are more equivocal, like the ineffectual spectral mother of "Christabel" and the destructive mother of "The Three Graves," whose curse is murderous. But the predominant note is the nostalgia for the breast, a nostalgia that sometimes seems to function as a synecdoche for a broader loneliness. The "Hexameters" written in Germany to the Wordsworths place the evocation of a child born blind, "Him that never beheld the swelling breast of his mother," near the naked closing appeal: "William, my head and my heart! dear William and dear Dorothea! / You have all in each other; but I am lonely, and want you!" (P, 1:305.30, 35-36). Thus both the poetry and the prose reveal a deep-seated wish for nourishment of various sorts through most of the poet's life. But this wish needs to be complemented by Coleridge's frequent self- accusations of a want of inner substance, strength, and will-ritual complaints of a personal hollowness amounting to a different kind of poverty: "My nature requires another nature for its support, and reposes Thomas M. Greene 909</page><page sequence="4">only in another / from the necessary indigence of its being" (Notebooks, 1:1679). Here the indigence is internalized, as it appears to be in the letter to Poole evoking inner as well as outer poverty. Later in life Coleridge writes of himself: "I feel, with an intensity unfathomable by words, my utter nothingness, impotence, &amp; worthlessness, in and for myself' (L, 3:498). When still later he writes a half-apologetic, half- accusing letter about his troubled son Hartley, one senses a transference of his own self-perception to the young man: "Alas! it is the absence of a Self, it is the want or torpor of Will, that is the mortal Sickness of Hartley's Being, and has been, for good &amp; for evil, his character-his moral Idiocy-from his earliest Childhood" (L, 5:232). This "absence of a self' in the son sounds like the father's "nothingness" and "necessary indigence." It would not be the first time that Hartley served as a surrogate, as we shall see below. The "torpor of the will" recurs frequently in the father's correspondence as his besetting fault, there also a sickness and a deadly absence. Thus the "want" as lack, need, wish, poverty, incompleteness, hollow- ness, yearning, the want we met in the notebook entry that served as our point of departure, can be shown to have multiple sources in the writer's tormented life. But the assumption that the biographical material suffices as a hermeneutic basis is a trap to be avoided. Coleridge, writing not egoistically but universally, speaks in the notebook entry of "all minds," and the want is directed toward a generalized externality which the writer wishes somehow to embrace. "Events and images . . . are like light, and air, and moisture," he writes, without which the mind "would else rot and perish;" it must "assimilate and digest the food which it thus receives from without."' Experience thus becomes an effort of mental survival through assimilation. The man who wrote these words is also the author of a poem which evokes the ravages of thirst as powerfully as any in our language: ". . . every tongue, through utter drought, / Was withered at the root" (P, 1:191.135-36). It is notable that the drama of a partially satisfied privation is traceable in several of the conversation poems. It surfaces in the vexing "strange and extreme silentness" of "Frost at Midnight;" it provides the dramatic situation of "This Lime- Tree Bower my Prison": I have lost / Beauties and feelings, such as would have been / Most sweet to my remembrance . . . (P, 1:178.79.2-4); it supplies the pathos of "Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retire- ment," which ends with a fantasized return to the abandoned cottage and its hortus amoenus, and then, after an expressed hope that all might enjoy such a home, concludes with a burst of rhetorical overkill: "Speed it, O Father! Let thy Kingdom come!" (P, 1:108.71). The drama will be 910 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="5">played out on a darker stage with a more convoluted plot in "Dejection: an Ode." All of these poems enact various responses to an experience of impoverishment; we shall need to return to two of them. Only the frightening vacuity of the late "Limbo" and "Ne Plus Ultra" is unrelieved by any counter-presence. One way to read Coleridge is to follow the various efforts, more or less successful according to the context, of the summoned counter-presences to comfort the ache of the void and allow the mind its vague but life-preserving assimilation. II It is in the context of this vague but ubiquitous intuition of want that Coleridge's theory of symbolism can usefully be understood. The symbol is what partly gratifies the desiderium. It derives from the capacity that certain phenomena acquire within certain gifted minds to attract a semiotic plus-value beyond their concrete existence, an aura of significa- tion transcending the concrete without suppressing its perceived reality. The yearning Coleridge attributes to the soul is primarily a hunger for that accretion of meaning heightened by the sensory vividness the phenomenon assumes. Without the symbolic supplement, the objective phenomenon is dead; it lends itself to the permutations of fancy, or worse, to the mechanical, sterile processes of Hartleyan associationism. But once perceived symbolically, the phenomenon is perceived as "living" and thus available to be absorbed by the soul as nourishment for its craving. In Coleridge's formulations, the unity of fused vividness and meaning within the symbol, linking image and idea, renders the poetic sensibility more permeable, reduces the distinction between inner and outer, self and non-self, and so relieves the metaphysical loneliness of the isolated creature. But the relief is never complete because the union falls short of the absolute Platonic union. The precise manner in which symbols serve to mitigate the "necessary indigence" of the writer and those others who share it is variously and frequently described in Coleridge's vast corpus. One of the densest, though not the clearest, descriptions can be found in a notebook meditation earlier than the desiderium entry, a meditation anticipating some of the later note's themes with a more positive accent. In looking at objects of Nature while I am thinking, as at yonder moon dim-glimmering thro' the dewy window-pane, I seem rather to be speaking, as it were asking, a symbolical language for something within me that already and forever exists, than observing anything new. Even when the latter is the case, yet still I have always an Thomas M. Greene 911</page><page sequence="6">obscure feeling as if that new phaenomenon were the dim Awakening of a forgotten or hidden Truth of my inner Nature / It is still interesting as a Word, a Symbol! It is Logos, the Creator! &lt;and the evolver!&gt; (Notebooks, 2:2546) A passage like this one has to be read less as a discursive speculation than an inchoate poem, and as such, it brings into loose connection a number of characteristic motifs: the precise notation of a perception, here the effect of dim moonlight on a clouded window; the wanting or "asking" for something elusive; the neo-Platonic forgotten truth; the language of symbols intuited as perennial; the permeability of the supposed barrier between inner and outer reality; the ultimate theological grounding of this language. The causal relationship between these motifs as the entry formulates it defies simple paraphrase. But the visual notation seems to lead to an asking for that language of symbols corresponding to an inner presence that the notation awakens. The observed effect is considered as itself a symbolic word analogous to or participating in the supreme creative Logos. The topos of the Book of the World is complicated by the superposition of the Book of the Inner Nature. Kathleen Coburn paraphrases this entry: "The active participating response to the book of nature is both projective and receptive: inner and outer worlds come together in the Word, the Symbol."'7 One might say that the projective and receptive acts become one. Coburn's receiv- ing appears to correspond to what Coleridge called, as we saw above, the mind's assimilation of external materials. The act of asking for a language brings to consciousness an inner Truth that simultaneously serves to receive with understanding a natural phenomenon and thus to "create" it. The asking in this entry recalls the "want" in the desiderium entry, but the result is more satisfying; the nourishment here is accessible and it comes with the guarantee of the primal giver. The process of assimilation without which, we recall, the mind will "rot and perish," is comple- mented by a creative semiotic impulse. For Wordsworth, the poetic spirit was "creator and receiver both," receiver because creator.8 In Coleridge, a circulation of energy takes place that is indistinguishable from a circulation of symbols and that does now restore the parched soul. Among his various fragmentary and sometimes inconsistent accounts of the solacing of our original poverty, this little jotting is surely one of the richest. A passage in the Philosophical Lectures devoted to prayer would return to the productivity of asking. 912 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="7">Ask, and in the very energy of asking... the energy of the soul to act is by the divine grace made to be the very means of strength, made to be the very wing by which you are to fly and from which alone you can.9 Within the body of Coleridge's writing, this has to be read as more than an account of prayer as such. It can stand rather as another statement of that simultaneous act comprising projection and interiorization, this latter process here metaphorized as "flying." The asker is granted by grace the "ascent," the spiritual fulfillment, he asks for. The energy of asking magically provides the strength to achieve the goal. The circle of projecting and receiving is simultaneous. It is this circle that breaks down in "Dejection: an Ode," where famously it is evoked as a privilege the speaker has lost: "0 Lady! we receive but what we give" (P, 1:365.47). There the speaker has lost his energy of asking, his power to project what he calls "Joy" and thus to consummate the wedding with Nature he desires. A corollary implication suggests that the speaker has lost the power to compose poetry, since the "shaping spirit of Imagination" has deserted him. Within the ode, the circle of projection and assimilation on which the imagination depends has short-circuited. How seriously should a reader consider this version of mental life, whether productive or unproductive, nearly two centuries after its formulation? For the post-Saussurean reader, the theory blurs the crucial element of the sign or, in most of these contexts, the linguistic sign, the word. The relationship between the Coleridgean symbol and spoken or written language wavers from passage to passage. In "Dejec- tion," the active projection of joy upon nature by the "lady" addressed seems to dispense with the word altogether. Coleridge sometimes fails to draw the connection even when the context would seem to invite it, as in the poem "To William Wordsworth," composed after listening to his friend's reading of "The Prelude." A list of the many elements that make up Wordsworth's poem includes the following: ... moments awful, Now in thy inner life, and now abroad, When power streamed from thee, and thy soul received The light reflected, as a light bestowed .. (P, 1:404-5.16-19) These lines sketch clearly the projective circle initiated by Wordsworth's "power," but the power itself comes through as a personal endowment not necessarily linguistic, not even in this poem about a poem. Most Thomas M. Greene 913</page><page sequence="8">modern readers will want to insert some form of the sign into the projective-assimilative circle. But once that major adjustment is made, then I think that we must not blind ourselves to the profundity of Coleridge's insight. Our capacity to "receive," to assimilate the world responsively, does arguably depend upon signifying mental projections that can alternately be regarded as names, metaphors, symbols, or myths. Our native indigence is partially, progressively mitigated by the nourishment stemming from the myth- oligization inherent in our "naming" the Umwelt as well as the Innenwelt. This mythologizing through signs is the means all human beings employ to gain a minimal control over both mysterious worlds and, so to speak, domesticate them. Artists shape finer metaphors and myths to make the universe more deeply acceptable to the otherwise alienated subject. Through the shaped sign the phenomena of our world acquire whatever presencing they are capable of attaining. We have no need in our day to be reminded of the elisions, duplicities, and perversities of language, and yet through this imperfect medium the world does achieve the only solidity it can provide us. To name the objects around us is to isolate and define them, to call them into being out of an ontological gray area, and this calling might well be described as an asking for their presence. It is Coleridge's wisdom to understand that only in the intensity of "asking" are we likely to receive a satisfying response-or rather that the two experiences are identical. On the occasions when the circle is brought off successfully, the achievement for Coleridge has something to do with the quasi-theologi- cal connection made in the window-pane notebook entry between the word or the symbol and the Logos. The creative word, what Coleridge called the living word, has an altered relationship to the thing it denotes. The lectures on Shakespeare lay stress on this bond between the poetic and the divine Word. The bond results from the tendency of poetic language, and most notably Shakespearean language, to lose the arbi- trary character to which most human language is limited. The sound sun, or the figures s, u, n, are purely arbitrary modes of recalling the object, and for visual mere objects not only sufficient, but have infinite advantages from their very nothingness per se. But the language of nature is a subordinate Logos, that was in the beginning, and was with the thing represented, and it was the thing represented. Now the language of Shakespeare, in his Lear for instance, is a something intermediate between these two [human language and the language of nature]; or rather it is the former 914 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="9">blended with the latter,-the arbitrary, not merely recalling the cold notion of the thing, but expressing the reality of it, and, as arbitrary language is the heirloom of the human race, being itself a part of that which it manifests.10 Gerald Bruns comments: "Here the Johannine Word is echoed in that original and perhaps magical word which, as a matter of nature, was identical with the world ... In Coleridge's view, the language of poetry aspires to this primitive condition in which word and world are one." Shakespearean language-and in this respect his supreme poetry can be taken to stand for all great poetry-drifts toward the condition of the Logos, which is identical to its referent, and the subordinate Logos which is nature. Bruns paraphrases: What distinguishes the language of Shakespeare from ordinary speech is that it is rather more symbolic than arbitrary-more symbol than sign-and accordingly it works to induce that original, primitive condition of mind in which word and world appear to constitute a luminous and undifferentiated whole." The verbal instruments of the secondary imagination are no longer limited by convention but begin to acquire the density and potency of living things. Yet it is important to note that in Coleridge's thought, this acquisition is never complete. Poetry may "aspire" to a theological condition but it never fully achieves it. It remains in a middle ground between the arbitrary and the theological. James C. McCusick com- ments on the Shakespearean passage: "Shakespeare's task as a dramatic poet is to naturalize . . . arbitrary signs, so that they express the reality, not the 'cold notion,' of the thing signified."'2 The poetic text then becomes a space where this struggle to naturalize signs and express realities is enacted. But the struggle apparently remains incomplete. "I would endeavor," Coleridge wrote Godwin, "to destroy the old antithesis of Words &amp; Things, elevating, as it were, words into Things, &amp; living Things too" (L, 1:352). But this remains an endeavor. Bruns's term "magical" is used by Coleridge himself in a famous definition from the Biographia Literaria: ".... that synthetic and magical power, to which we have exclusively appropriated the name of imagina- tion" (BL, 2:16). It is by no means clear what "magical" means in this context, but it gains in clarity in conjunction with the passage on Shakespearean language, where Bruns rightly detects a magical drift. To my knowledge Coleridge does not, within his published writing, explic- itly link this aspiration of poetic language with the projective circle. But Thomas M. Greene 915</page><page sequence="10">there is a sense in which his thought seems to call for this linkage. In view of the struggle toward a magical identity between word and world, the calling into being of a new entity through language becomes less mysterious. A poem "names" a new signified that has no synonyms and that can be assimilated in a reader's consciousness. The energy of asking is likely to be successful if it draws on that profoundest potency of the mind, that linguistic power that can penetrate things and render them available for assimilation. "Magical" is a word that in our culture arouses suspicion; it evokes the self-deceptions and demagogueries that manipulative language notori- ously abets. But this justified suspicion can inhibit the perception that language, like all signs, depends upon a fundamental magic that we need to function as human beings. Semiotics is indeed the science of that profoundly irrational necessity of connecting sounds or marks or ges- tures or visual representations with those signified conceptions the signs bring into being. Without that basic magic, we are helpless; with it, we are empowered to function in the world, and it cannot be surprising that the earliest traces of humanoid culture are inseparable from one or another form of magical behavior. This behavior is perpetuated in our own culture by our intuitive incapacity to separate the verbal signifier from its signified, and least of all in reading poetry, where Coleridge correctly discerned a drift toward the felt identity of word and world. Thus one can jettison if one chooses the theological ramifications of his thought without losing its theoretical force. The vitalistic metaphor is as useful as any in distinguishing the particular quality of language that does bring into being new, dynamic, assimilable signifieds. The "Want" that darkened Coleridge's life and from which his theory of poetry can be seen to spring would then become a lack that is universally human and universally mitigated by art. III One might take this thought a step further and consider any given poem as an attempt to initiate a projective circle permitting an intuitive interiorization. Poems could then be read as verbal experiments testing whether, within the imaginary situations they sketch, a succession of empowered signs can mythologize a fragmentary human context in such a way as to permit its appropriation, permitting the speaker's soul to receive "the light reflected, as a light bestowed." In Lacanian terms, a poem would thus test the space for ludic maneuver by the individual subject within the constraints of the symbolic order. Such a test is by 916 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="11">definition precarious; it leaves open the possibility of failure-the potential misnamings, narcissistic metaphors, self-deceptive mytholo- gies, manipulative anthropomorphisms, that might conceivably skew the projective circle.'" Such a test would also have to confront the harshest negativities of experience-not only the sustaining landscape but the impoverished psyche; it would indeed have to recognize directly or indirectly the poverty that made it necessary. The light bestowed would have to become, if necessary, a pitiless lucidity. The very intuition of want might be said to be comforted by a metaphorized naming so vivid as to magnify its understanding and thus its capacity for acceptance. To name as fully and lucidly and profoundly as possible might in itself produce a release, might even extend by some measure the degree of liberty available to the poetic speaker. Such a gain, if the poem justifies it, could serve as an idealized and compressed version of an analogous gain potentially available to the reader. By calling into existence a new verbal construct resistant to paraphrase, the poem would become that exercise of asking which can legitimately but not certainly expect to gratify its desire. And here the middle position Coleridge assigned to Shakespearean (read poetic) language would become crucial. Endeavoring always to escape pure conventionality, to become motivated, to be "natural," aspiring toward an identification with the referent yet falling short of theological identity, poetic language appears as the appropriate vehicle for the exercise of precarious magic. It should be added that for those who still believe in such a thing, the esthetic success of the poem would not depend on the success of the dramatized experiment. The former would depend rather on the reso- nance and stringency and integrity of the incipient circle's representa- tion; it would depend also on the engagement of the rhythmic cadences with the specific moral style. The poem that wins our respect or our love is obliged to enact its little drama in good faith, with the authentic magic of empowered signs but not the debased magic of sleights of rhetoric, and a lucid enactment may ultimately be regarded as a projective failure. Thus a brilliant text like the "Ode to a Nightingale" might finally be read as a powerful dramatization of projective weakness and a failure of coherent mythologization, since in that case the speaker does not demonstrably achieve any increment of liberty.14 Readings of two poems by Coleridge may clarify these assumptions. The first of these will be "Frost at Midnight," rightly regarded as the most effective of the so-called "conversation poems." There the protago- nist begins by locating himself in a cottage near the sea late on a winter evening; since the other members of the household are abed, he alone Thomas M. Greene 917</page><page sequence="12">remains awake, his infant son's cradle nearby. After the faint mythologiz- ing (and slightly riddling) reference of the first line ("The Frost performs its secret ministry"), the dramatic situation sketched in the opening passage is epitomized by the phrase "strange and extreme silentness," which we are told "disturbs and vexes meditation"(P, 1:240.8-10). The phrase is puzzling if taken literally, since an owl's cry is reported to be audible outdoors. As the poem develops, the mildly disturbing silentness becomes explicable rather as an absence of symbolizable objects on which the speaker's fanciful or imaginative faculties might be brought to bear. The world is so quiet and familiar that it frustrates what Dr. Johnson's Imlac called "that hunger of imagination which preys inces- santly upon life, and must be always appeased by some employment."'15 Nothing invites creative mythologization except the very vacuum which is therefore qualified as vexatious. But the vacuum then gives way to a flickering phenomenon which offers the lowest denominator conceivable to the symbolizing consciousness. ... the thin blue flame Lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not; Only that film, which fluttered on the grate, Still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing. Methinks its motion in this hush of nature Gives it dim sympathies with me who live, Making it a companionable form, Whose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit By its own moods interprets, every where Echo or mirror seeking of itself, And makes a toy of Thought. (P, 1:240-41.13-23) The flimsy film on the grate is a limiting case-the least human object to which the fancy might stoop, the least articulate, the least open to metaphor. And yet the fancy does reach out to the fluttering thing to discern in its motion the simulacrum of life; it becomes, in an expressive phrase, a "companionable form" to the lonely subject in need even of such companionship. A kind of incipient projective circle is initiated that however is half-deprecated; the idling spirit interprets the film's puny freaks by its own moods, anthropomorphically and capriciously. The semi-ludic caprice of the circle remains even when a quiet adverb-"every where"-abruptly expands this idle game from a single nocturnal whim to a constant human habit. The reader is reminded of 918 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="13">our original notebook entry wishing for an "approximation to that absolute Union, which the soul sensible of its imperfection in itself, of its Halfness, yearns after." So in "Frost at Midnight," the spirit repeatedly seeks an echo or mirror; the quest, however ostensibly trivial, is ubiquitous. This is what the human spirit does; it seeks out mirrors even from the most unlikely sources; in its lack, it yearns for even the most inappropriate companionable forms. This poem's example shows the mind's capacity to project companionship on anything, but it also shows how insufficient a common object can be in response to the mind's asking. Whatever is sought can only be a toy of thought; the asker can only hope for a whimsical, dilettantish circle that cannot be expected seriously to gratify the vexations of lack. The stress here falls on the distance between the mind and its object- mirror; there is no place for the esemplastic imagination; the relation of the object to the anthropomorphic meaning provisionally assigned it is fundamentally disjunctive. Insofar as the passage adumbrates a theory of semiotics, it offers what could be termed an anti-symbolic semiotic theory. Although this theory is not explicitly extended to language, it is consonant with a conventional, anti-Johannine linguistics in which the word remains distinctly separate from its referent. Such a linguistics befits the low-keyed tone of the opening of this conversation poem, which seems to promise an unbuttoned removal from all sublime rhetorical gestures. The very expression "dim sympathies" reaches back across pre-Romantic psychological theories of sympathy to the hermetic tradition Coleridge knew well, a tradition that stipulated a network of universal magnetisms or sympathies the initiate could play upon. But the magical circles that initiate could manipulate have here been reduced to the playful idiosyncrasies of a consciousness unwilling to assign much force to its desires. If poetic language struggles toward a magical identity of word and world, a passage like this one severely limits its potential success. In the subsequent central section glancing back at the speaker's school days, the modulation to a warmer tone, nostalgic and half-rueful, hinges on the superstition attached to the film on the grate, explained by the poet in a footnote: "In all parts of the kingdom these films are called strangers and supposed to portend the arrival of some absent friend." The schoolboy who had seen one in the evening waited all the next day while feigning study, "Awed by the sterm preceptor's face" (P, 1:241.37). But the folk-magic typically failed to work despite his credulity, and the boy's hopes were disappointed. Thomas M. Greene 919</page><page sequence="14">... still my heart leaped up, For still I hoped to see the stranger's face, Townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved, My playmate when we both were clothed alike! (P, 1:241-42.40-43) The last line reminds us that small boys were dressed like girls in that era. But it only acquires relevance if it underscores the role of the visitor as alter ego, the missing halfness the boy is seeking as the grown man would seek it. A kind of analogy emerges with the opening section; the boy is waiting for a companionable form, a mirror of himself, just as the adult musingly seeks one, and the flashback allows a gentle pathos to emerge that the adult almost represses. But in both present and past the protagonist is alone and lonely, looking for, asking for, an adequate response. The groundlessness of the superstition reinforces the disjunc- tive skepticism; how could there be a link between the supposed presage and the expected visit? The old wives' tale, with its absurd gap between augury and result, might be said to parody any belief in the conjuncture of sign and thing. The very word "stranger" applied hopefully to the film focusses a paradox emerging from the poem. In a sense it's the wrong word, since the film portends a visit from a friend-one who is a stranger only in the sense of living at a distance and unlikely to put in an appearance. The word "stranger" really means its opposite, by a metamorphosis akin to the shift from the alien film to a loved one, one's second self. This of course has already occurred in the opening section, where the ostensibly remote flicker of film becomes a sign of life, a comfort, a "friend," an echo of the self. The ubiquity of the search for the echo "every where" evokes a human consciousness forever projecting pathetic fallacies, like that in the opening line which assigns the frost a ministry. But the search as we observe it thus far leaves the consciousness at worst forever watchful and disappointed, like the schoolboy, or at best resigned to the puny flaps which the spirit can claim as its correlative toy. The speaker is self-condemned to idle anthropomorphic projections that yield little to be assimilated. It is true that the recognition of this asserted human destiny, once it were fully apprehended in all its implications, would offer a mythologized version of experience inviting a painful but substan- tial interiorization. But this full apprehension is only begun within the poem. Instead, the next and last section turns abruptly away from the speaker's past and present to the future of the infant sleeping at the 920 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="15">speaker's side. In the place of the absent alter ego from the past, the sister who failed to appear, the baby becomes a real alter ego upon whose future the father can project an idealized fantasy. The intertwining of the two is delicately suggested in the opening apostrophe. Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side, Whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm, Fill up the interspers6d vacancies And momentary pauses of the thought! (P, 1:242.44-48) The father's gorgeous hopes for the child will indeed fill up his vacancies, will release as prophecies the desires he has heretofore half-repressed. Now the conversational tone of the earlier sections modulates to a measured prophetic intensity, as mythologization gives way to pure vision. The son will be privileged to pass his childhood in a sublime natural setting, far from the "cloisters dim" of the father's early years, and thus will be free to wander among the lakes and shores and crags whose presence will be transformative. ... so shalt thou see and hear The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible Of that eternal language, which thy God Utters, who from eternity doth teach Himself in all, and all things in himself. Great universal Teacher! he shall mould Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask. (P, 1:242.58-64) The feeble anthropomorphisms of the father are to be replaced by the divine circles of an eternal language initiated by God but that a pantheistic world maintains in perpetual circulation. This is a vision of perfect tuition from the universal Teacher, a majestic substitute for the father's "stern preceptor," and a vision of perfect responsiveness wherein the yearning, the desiderium, for completeness is abundantly gratified. This universe of perfect responsiveness, where even the clouds "image" the forms of the landscape, is also a universe of an essentialist linguistics, where word and world are identical. The boy will inhabit that Utopian semiotic realm where no disjuncture is conceivable between representa- tion and the represented, where all things are words and where asking, to complete the felicity, can only stem from a prior gift; the Teacher by giving makes the spirit ask. The conception of this world of perfect, perennial linguistic circles, Thomas M. Greene 921</page><page sequence="16">magical in their copia, authorizes the potency ascribed to the blessing that closes the poem: "Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee ..." (P, 1:242.65). The mood is indicative but the hortative pressure makes itself felt, as the seasons of the son's life find delicate metaphors in the marvelous images of the turning year that conclude the poem. By now the father, rapt by the presage of his son's fulfillment, has achieved apparently a poise and a moral seriousness reflected by his rhetorical mastery. The dilettante has become a seer as the universe to be assimilated has grown to be immense. Everything now has become a speaking symbol that repairs the fragmentation of the asker. The accrued liberty of the speaker can be recognized in the assurance of his concluding blessing, an assurance that overshadows the petty vexations of his earlier idleness. This euphoric interpretation is one that the poem seems to invite, and yet it leaves a few shadows of doubt. The moving poetic effectiveness of the close remains vulnerable to the disjunctive skepticism that preceded it. Isn't it conceivable that the vision of pervasive Utopian language itself stems from our hankering for echoes of ourselves? May not the shaping power of God that teaches how to ask be itself a toy of thought, a mirror of want? Perhaps the speaker's self-deceptions have reduced his range of lucid freedom. The middle position of our conative human linguistics seems to have been dismissed. The transition from disjunction to perennial presence depends upon the shift of focus from the father to the son, a shift that may merely mask a move from partial repression to free-floating fantasy. The energy of asking may well have been tainted by an unacknowledged displacement. We have seen how the text itself authorizes a consideration of the child as a second self, and once the otherness of the child is collapsed into the father's inner fancy, then we are perhaps entitled to speak of an insidious magic dependent on bad faith. The father after all has seen lakes and crags and clouds, without evidently participating in the divine linguistic exchange of the pantheistic landscape. From a hermeneutic of suspicion, "Frost at Midnight" leaves the satisfaction of want in a dubious future. It is one more example of asking that exemplifies the dimness of sympathies, even while bearing witness to an intense desire for the most intimate. How finally are we to consider this poem's projection of meanings, first modest and then tremendous, upon its dramatic context? If we identify its definitive myth with the final burst of hopeful prophecy, then the circle it initiates has to be regarded as equivocal. The poem itself furnishes the basis for its questioning. The reader is left without a credible symbolic complex available for appropriation. What the poem 922 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="17">does leave with us is really the tension between a disjunctive and conjunctive semiotics, two explicit theories that in turn solicit the protagonist as lived experience. This tension is truly significant, since it pervades all culture and not least poetry. The reader who can recognize that at the core of the poem will find a great deal to assimilate-the irrepressible suspension between the kind of instinctive magic that mitigates want and the coercive kind that dreams of abolishing it. IV The resourceful projective capacity that, in "Frost at Midnight," fastens companionably on the least promising object is announced as lost in "Dejection: an Ode," and this loss that numbs the shaping spirit of imagination is the burden of the later poem. Most of it anatomizes the anomie resulting from an inability to project and thus to absorb, to "give" and "receive," and so to consummate a life-giving wedding with nature. One reading of "Dejection" might describe it as an elegy for that faculty that is quite literally equated with life: "Life, and Life's effluence, cloud at once and shower"(P, 1:365.66). To possess this faculty is to possess the inner radiance that is here called "Joy." To lack it is to shrivel toward death. Joy, the poem tells us, is "a sweet and potent voice" of the soul (P, 1:365.57) as it is a luminous cloud suffusing the world of the joyful individual. The reader never hears this voice just as the speaker, to his sorrow, is constitutionally unable to hear it. Nothing in fact speaks to him-that is his lament, and we hear no voice other than his own, not even that of the friend he intermittently apostrophizes as "Lady," a companion whose physical presence within the dramatic fiction of the ode is unclear.'6 At any rate, nothing and nobody speaks but the poet throughout the first six stanzas, and he himself complains of the inexpressibility of his torpor: A grief without a pang, void, dark, and drear, A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief, Which finds no natural outlet, no relief, In word, or sigh, or tear ... (P, 1:364.21-24) It is true that despite his protest he does succeed, as in these lines, in rendering the symptoms of his depression circumstantial and affecting. His auto-diagnosis, alternating with evocations of the projective power he lacks, occupies the main body of the poem comprising stanzas 2 through 6. Thomas M. Greene 923</page><page sequence="18">The opening stanza, spilling over into the second, sketches a dramatic context: the reader gathers that the protagonist is seated at dusk on an April evening watching thin clouds in the western sky intersect with stars, while a nagging breeze produces moans from an Aeolian lute. The circumference of a full moon is visible within the shape of a new moon, a portent that the speaker, quoting the ballad of "Sir Patrick Spens," correctly interprets as presaging a storm. These elements of a dramatic context are skilfully introduced but are then ignored for several stanzas, as the expression of profound anguish leads both speaker and reader almost to forget the fictive situation. This expression as it proceeds might be regarded as Coleridge's ultimate statement of radical inner poverty. The myth of the projective circle as it is formulated here becomes a myth of redemption from poverty. O Lady! we receive but what we give, And in our life alone does Nature live: Ours is her wedding garment, ours her shroud! And would we aught behold, of higher worth, Than that inanimate cold world allowed To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd, Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud Enveloping the Earth- And from the soul itself must there be sent A sweet and potent voice, of its own birth Of all sweet sounds the life and element! (P, 1:365.47-58) As a plausible myth of redemption, this might be said to exhibit two major problems. The first we have already noticed: this version assigns no role to the sign, and notably the verbal sign. The circle of giving and receiving is purely psychologistic. The voice of lines 56-58 is a metaphor for a non-linguistic faculty of the soul; it speaks no words. Its exchanges are comparable to the "eternal language" of "Frost at Midnight," a natural language untouched by disjunction. Both poems, like "The Eolian Harp," are haunted by the ideal of a perfectly adequate circle of communication without risk, without struggle, without imperfection. This is a linguistic or semiotic idealism that would banish incompleteness and conation, and would repress the tension in human language between the opposing attractions of disjunction and identity. The second problem stems from the first. It has to do with whatever in the world does not lend itself to sweetness and luminosity. How 924 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="19">exactly does the fair luminous cloud envelop pain? The somewhat abstract lady (who replaces a series of predecessors in earlier versions of the ode) is able to emit joy because she is "pure of heart"; the rest of us in the ever-anxious crowd seem doomed to be deprived of her world's glory. Thus the semiotic idealism leads to a moral idealism that represses suffering as it represses endeavor. What I think is most impressive in this large poem is its implicit recognition of these insufficiencies. It moves toward this recognition by means of a motif introduced at the beginning and then dropped through stanza 6-the gathering tempest announced by the freshening breeze and the appearance of the moon. The arrival of the tempest would, the protagonist has told us, actually be welcome. And oh! that even now the gust were swelling, And the slant night-shower driving loud and fast! Those sounds which oft have raised me, whilst they awed, And sent my soul abroad, Might now perhaps their wonted impulse give, Might startle this dull pain, and make it move and live! (P, 1:363.15-20) As the speaker imagines the fair luminous cloud potentially enveloping the earth, he ignores the building storm and the jangling lute which might remind him of the demonic sympathies between an agonized nature and an agonized psyche. These might well send his soul abroad, jar it from its torpid self-involvement. And this in fact is what will happen in the extraordinary stanza 7, which effects an explicit turn from self- destruction to description. Hence, viper thoughts, that coil around my mind, Reality's dark dream! I turn from you, and listen to the wind, Which long has raved unnoticed. (P, 1:367.94-97) In terms of logical structure, the poem has no visible need for the long stanza that follows, by far the longest it contains. The terrific account of the raving storm has no function that is immediately apparent. But by a subtler logic its presence and its elaboration are crucial. The storm does finally introduce what the preceding poem has heretofore suppressed, the voiced extremity of acute pain. Thomas M. Greene 925</page><page sequence="20">What a scream Of agony by torture lengthened out That lute sent forth! (P, 1:367.97-99) The raving wind, "Mad Lutanist!," with demonic fury makes "Devils' yule" in this spring season. Thou Actor, perfect in all tragic sounds! Thou mighty Poet, e'en to frenzy bold! What tell'st thou now about? 'Tis of the rushing of an host in rout, With groans of trampled men, with smarting wounds- At once they groan with pain, and shudder with the cold! But hush! there is a pause of deepest silence! And all that noise, as of a rushing crowd, With groans, and tremulous shudderings-all is over- It tells another tale, with sounds less deep and loud! A tale of less affright, And tempered with delight, As Otway's self had framed the tender lay,- 'Tis of a little child Upon a lonesome wild, Not far from home, but she hath lost her way: And now moans low in bitter grief and fear, And now screams loud, and hopes to make her mother hear. (P, 1:367-68.108-125) The storm is not a metaphor of dejection; it is rather a counter-metaphor to the speaker's stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief. But it offers him a projective vehicle for generating metaphors, as the tranquil thin clouds mingled with stars (P, 1:362.31-34) had failed to do. The storm releases a language of pain that had previously been occluded. The speaker becomes himself a poet bold to frenzy, whose language rises to the elemental violence, the agony, the torture he hears in the lute, and in registering that raving destruction, allows him-and us-to take it in. The storm-wind and its instrument the lute open the poem to agony, to screams and groans (three repetitions of this latter word in five lines), to the fantasies and terrors previously submerged in glacial silence, and finally to the primal wish of the poet-"orphan" for the mother in its closing lines. Here the line, always narrow, between author and speaker almost disappears."7 The final, shattering image of the motherless child is prefaced with four lines of misleading preparation ("tempered with 926 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="21">delight"), as though desperately to mitigate its grief. The final phrase- "hopes to make her mother hear"-seems to leave space for hope while in fact only deepening the pathos.'s A series of progressively charged metaphors culminates in that fundamental want which the poet Coleridge, like most men and women, carries half-buried through life. The tremendous seventh stanza offers an alternative darker mode of projection to the luminous version attributed to the lady. It anticipates a more awesome, chthonic wedding with nature than hers. The natural wordless "voice" of the soul and of the landscape is replaced by an audible voice that is assigned metaphoric and thus partially disjunctive expression, but the metaphoric groans and screams emergent from the storm are themselves identical to their meanings. The language of the storm, like the poetic language that translates it, is back where charged language must be, struggling toward expressive motivation. The reader is not told that this voicing of the storm, which is also a release of fear and desire, heals the protagonist's spiritual infirmity. But it is surely no accident that the very last stanza 8 supplies as a coda a turning toward the beloved lady, less abstract now, with a blessing less Utopian than the prophecy that closes "Frost at Midnight." I suggested above that the projective mythologizations of poetry, to be effective, might need to confront the darkest negativities. This surely is what occurs in "Dejection." The poet does at the end find his verbal "outlet" and with it his receptiveness. He has discovered the metaphoric generativity of the storm, and when as a result he opens himself to pain as he earlier could not, he is now capable of turning away from himself and of asking for the concrete joy of a concrete woman. He is able now to send his soul "abroad." May all the stars hang bright above her dwelling, Silent as though they watched the sleeping Earth! With light heart may she rise, Gay fancy, cheerful eyes, Joy lift her spirit, joy attune her voice; To her may all things live, from pole to pole, Their life the eddying of her living soul! (P, 1:368.130-39) She is no longer the impersonal principle of joy, but a potential participant. And the speaker now possesses an energy of asking in the form of a benediction. His apparent poverty shows itself sufficiently relieved as to be capable of a speech-act of generosity. An increment of Thomas M. Greene 927</page><page sequence="22">freedom, the reader might assume, has mitigated his paralysis. This poem that began by abandoning one version of the projective circle closes by enacting tentatively the effective completion of another. v This account of Coleridge's strategies of dealing with his perceived psychic wants must itself avoid too luminous a projection. Too strong a pressure of desire, as in "Frost at Midnight," could call into question the projective habit. The turn to the demonic which in "Dejection" appears to be liberating could in other texts produce horror. In the truly frightening "Pains of Sleep," the oneiric wish begets images too revolting to be swallowed by daylight. Desire with loathing strangely mixed On wild or hateful objects fixed. Fantastic passions! maddening brawl! And shame and terror over all! (P, 1:390.23-26) Even the marvelous epiphanies of "Kubla Khan" modulate into danger- ous chimeras that by the end are slipping out of the control of the poet- shaman. Its ending constitutes a literal cry for help. I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice! And all who hear should see them there, And all should cry, Beware! Beware! His flashing eyes, his floating hair! Weave a circle round him thrice, And close your eyes with holy dread ... (P, 1:298.46-52) Whatever else in the poem Coleridge meant, that "Beware! Beware!" surely should be taken seriously. If we need a motive for his breaking the poem off, there it is surely in the text. The projective circle is displaced into the apotropaic circle that may or may not keep the dervish within bounds. Black magic may infiltrate creative magic. In other poems, the uncanny figure of the ancient mariner is disturbing though essentially benevolent, but the same cannot be said of the insidious Geraldine. If, as several scholars have suggested, Coleridge identified with his self- projection Christabel, then Geraldine can be seen as a figure of sinister intrusion into an imagination excessively receptive.'9 What if the symbol 928 Coleridge and the Energy of Asking</page><page sequence="23">completes the self with a grotesque impropriety, forming an androgyne- monster? Wordsworth thought that "Words are too awful an instrument for good and evil, to be trifled with," and he inserted his suspicions into The Prelude. Visionary power Attends the motions of the viewless winds, Embodied in the mystery of words: There, darkness makes abode, and all the host Of shadowy things work endless changes .. .20 Coleridge, who thought that language was the highest token of human dignity and freedom, was nonetheless not insensitive to this darkness, as his failure to complete two famous dangerous poems may be taken to demonstrate. His texts suggest that through the exercise of imaginative language, our indigence may intermittently be relieved, but that we seldom know in advance the cost of its comfort. He seems to situate the human subject between the nobility of its circling energies and their tragic deformations. Yale University NOTES 1 The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed.

In Nature there is nothing melancholy. But some night-wandering man whose heart was pierced With the remembrance of a grievous wrong, Or slow distemper, or neglected love, (And so, poor wretch! filled all things with himself, And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale Of his own sorrow) he, and such as he, First named these notes a melancholy strain. (P, 1:264-65.15-22) 14 I trust that my use of the word "mythologize" and its cognates will be understood to be at once broad and neutral. To mythologize, as I speak of the act, is to cast a network of inventive and cohesive interpretation upon a given human situation, to isolate certain features at the expense of others and to assign them meanings or associations not clearly inherent in them. This essay assumes that some degree of mythologization is present in all human experience, but is heightened and intensified in an artistic sensibility. For this sensibility, Wordsworth's formulation in "Tintern Abbey" seems appropriate: ". .. All the mighty world / Of eye, and ear,-both what they half create, / And what perceive" (105- 7). It only remains to be added that this half-creation, in all sensibilities, can be self- serving and self-deceptive as well as genuinely heuristic. 15 Samuel Johnson, The History of Rasselas, Prince ofAbissinia, ed.

(P, 1:258.36-40) The storm-wind of "Dejection" apparently awakes an abiding terror of the poet's. 18 In connection with the image of the lost child, Reeve Parker quotes a letter to Poole of February, 1801, expressing a wish to talk with his friend "to the Tune of the Night Wind that pipes its thin doleful climbing sinking Notes like a child that has lost its way and is crying aloud, half in grief and half in the hope to be heard by its Mother" (L, 2:669).
