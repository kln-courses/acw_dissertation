Leo Tolstoy, Resident and Stranger: A Study in Fiction and Theol- ogy. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986. xviii, 480 pp. $29.50. Richard Gustafson has written what will undoubtedly prove to be one of the major studies of Tolstoy produced in his generation, a book that will surely take its place alongside the works of such eminent Russian tolstovedy as Eikhen- baum, Zaidenshnur, Bilinkis, Bocharov, Kupreianova, Bursov, and Galagan. It is obviously the product of many, many years of intense labor, leading to total mastery of the famous ninety volumes of the Jubilee Edition and to command of a vast array of secondary literature, not only about Tolstoy, but on the whole subject of what Gustafson calls "Eastern Christianity," which is more or less off limits to his Soviet colleagues. Even more important than the reading and toil that went into this book is the thinking, for this is an especially thoughtful book, full of ideas, insights, and perceptions that are very much Gustafson's own. It is a signal achievement. If some of my later remarks express some skepticism or disagreements with Gustafson, they should in no way be taken as negating my basic admiration for his accomplishment. In his preface Gustafson leads off with an attack on those who hold that "there are two Tolstoys, the pre-conversion artist and the post-conversion reli- gious thinker and prophet." In opposition to these misguided dualists, whose opinion he calls "received," Gustafson qua militant monophysite insists, on the contrary, that "Tolstoy is not two, but one" (p. xiv). Undoubtedly this sup- posedly widespread dyophysite delusion is something of a straw man that Gus- tafson has set up to be disdainfully demolished-though the master himself did abet the construction. Tolstoy liked to dramatize what he claimed were abrupt breaks in his life, when he would announce total repudiation of the past and his determination to lead henceforth an utterly new life; the "crisis" of 1878-80 was only the most extreme of these self-proclaimed metamorphoses. Genera- tions of critics and scholars have exposed the flimsiness of these fabrications, showing behind the shiny new mask the familiar, unregenerate features of that aggressive, competitive, guilt-ridden, self-pitying boy-turned-man whom his brothers called "Lyova-ryova" (Leo the cry-baby) or-this is Gustafson's strategy-discerning an embryonic "St. Leo" in the unsure, restless, searching, self-lacerating young man who set out for the Caucasus in 1851 in quest of a new self and a new career. Gustafson is far from the first to notice that as early</page><page sequence="2">The Russian Review as 1855, at the age of twenty-seven, Tolstoy wrote in his diary: A conversation about divinity and faith has suggested to me a great, stupendous idea, to the realization of which I feel capable of devoting my life. That idea is the founding of a new religion, corresponding to the present state of mankind: the reli- gion of Christ, but purged of dogmas and mysticism.... (Sobranie sochinenii, 19 [Moscow, 1965], 150). Thus the doctrine of "two Tolstoys" is no longer really "received" by much of anybody any more and certainly is not taken literally by serious Tolstoy scho- lars; perhaps, however, Tolstoy's own perception of himself as a changed man after 1880 deserves more respect than it has received. Nevertheless, though polemically unnecessary, Gustafson's almost fanati- cal insistence on a one and indivisible Tolstoy has led him to real discoveries, for which we should be grateful, though it has caused some blind spots, too. It has enabled him to perceive, more deeply than anyone has done before, the fun- damental unity in Tolstoy, a profound "oneness" that marks his work from beginning to end. Gustafson has discovered a host of parallels, inherent connec- tions and similarities of both structure and meaning, often of works far removed from one another in time and genre. Many of these links have, to my knowledge, never been noticed before, and like most such discoveries, these illuminations amaze us by their manifest rightness, even obviousness. "Notes of a Madman" (1884), an unfinished "story" directly reflecting a personal experience of some fifteen years earlier, a night of apparently unmotivated existential terror and anguish endured at an inn in Arzamas, turns out to be not only an obvious link between "life" and "literature," but to be an archetype or "paradigm" of numerous other existential crises undergone by Tolstoy's fictional heroes. To use Gustafson's words, it ...articulates in a simple image the deep structure of Tolstoy's major fictions. The main heroes, Nikolenka, Olenin, Prince Andrew, Pierre, Levin, and Nekhlyudov, all, although variously, go through such a series of cumulative revelations which result from sudden questions of faith posed by their lives in moments freed from custom and routine, often in the face of death (p. 196). Tolstoy's art is thus integrally bound up with his own quest for "salvation," and his "autopsychological fiction is grounded in the same moral and religious life from which the theology grew." It is such perceptions of recurrent underlying patterns in Tolstoy that were for me most exciting insights in Gustafson's work. To be sure, the hunt for I Andrew Wachtel has kindly pointed out to me that "Zapiski sumasshedshego" as an encapsu- lated, nuclear version of the theme of death and existential terror in Tolstoy is adumbrated in Ivan Bunin's Osvobozhdenie Tolstogo (1937). See I. A. Bunin, Sobranie sochinenii, 10 (Moscow: 1967), pp. 132-165. This is only one example, however, among many parallels perceived by Gustafson. 322</page><page sequence="3">Tolstoi Made Whole "deep structures" runs the risk of excessive abstractness, over-simplification, forcing complex and varied artistic phenomena to fit the procrustean bed of the critic's schemata. But Gustafson almost always avoids this peril. His analyses of the short stories and segments of novels he chooses to scrutinize closely are extraordinarily subtle and acute, wonderfully discerning, both in their psycho- logical penetration and their awareness of technique. I found especially illuminating his dissection of the character of Anna Karenina. Resolutely refus- ing to be seduced (as so many have been) by her charm or to allow his sympathy for her suffering or his indignation at society's hypocritical cruelty toward her to cloud his judgment, Gustafson sternly follows her down the primrose path, exposing the long series of evasions and lies by which she attempts to foist onto others the responsibility for her acts, beginning with her appearance in Moscow at the outset of the novel. There, as Gustafson demonstrates, she encourages Vronsky's attentions, uses the accidental death of the workman at the railway station to initiate a relationship with him, and, in dealing with the "confusion" in the Oblonsky family she has come to rectify, does nothing to confront her brother with the consequences of his adultery nor to urge on him the need for repentance and reform. Instead, she persuades Dolly to overlook Stiva's phi- landering on the pretense-which Anna knows to be false-that it will not be repeated. Such "innocuous" moral compromises, of course, anticipate the grosser twists and turns of Anna's later downward course. Some of Gustafson's most brilliant interpretations reflect his perception of latent allegories where most of us have discerned only realistic scenes, concrete and sensuously evoked to the point of virtual palpability. The great mowing scene in Anna Karenina, for example, is so vivid that one can almost smell the pungent sweetness of the new-mown hay and taste the ineffably delicious rusty warm water with green bits floating in it given to Levin in a tin dipper by his peasant mentor. Gustafson in no way denies or detracts from the intense con- creteness with which Tolstoy renders this scene, but he makes us recognize that at the same time it can validly be interpreted as a psycho-philosophical state- ment, one consistent with direct statements of this kind made by Tolstoy both earlier and later. As his skill with the scythe improves and his body adjusts to the rhythm of the mowing, Levin gradually submerges his ego in the collective activity, forgets his managerial concerns as the master of the estate, and becomes one with his peasants. During that time of intense physical labor he lives entirely in the present, oblivious of both past and future, and it is an experi- ence of absolute bliss. His body functions automatically, without the imposition of his will, and he feels that "some external force is moving him." As Gustaf- son puts it, "Mowing, Levin does not exist; he becomes the instrument of some- thing else. The mowing scene, therefore, because it is an emblem of life's task, the practice of love, and the establishment of identity, is an emblem of becom- ing an instrument of the Lord" (p. 447). Some readers, myself among them, may resist such an allegorization, partly on the grounds that the text of Anna Karenina contains nothing explicitly justifying the statement that Levin mowing has become an "instrument of the Lord." The formulation may indeed be, in 323</page><page sequence="4">The Russian Review the strict sense, anachronistic, anticipating language Tolstoy would not have used until later, but the parallels Gustafson draws between this scene and Tolstoy's latter-day theological imperatives are too convincing to be denied, especially the doctrine that our ultimate "freedom" consists in submerging our will in loving "at-onement" (Gustafson's word) with the All and living entirely in this moment now. Tolstoy the artist thus-perhaps in part unconsciously- adumbrates in concrete images the more abstract and all-encompassing formula- tions of Tolstoy the theologian. Gustafson has thoughtfully pursued this subject into a whole theory of "theological realism." Gustafson's drive toward perception of "deep structure" patterning does not blind him to the intricate configurations of Tolstoy's stylistic surfaces. Demonstrating his well-taken point that "Tolstoy's first concern as a writer...is the recreation of his or a character's emotion in the readers" (p. 375), Gustafson gives several splendid demonstrations of how this is done, from the alluring physical presence of Helene Kuragina, rustling with onomatopoetic alliteration as she makes her entry into War and Peace, to Princess Marya's perception from her father's "angry face controlling itself unnaturally" that the two of them have suffered a terrible calamity, the death of Prince Andrei (actually the news turned out to be, for the moment, false). A work of the length and complexity of Resident and Stranger inevitably accumulates its share of errors, and perhaps it is the reviewer's duty to record those he noticed. On p. 116, the plot of "Family Happiness" is summarized inaccurately. Lady S. is not Masha's friend, and Masha does not go with her to a musicale. Masha does not feel "only hatred and alienation" when the Italian Marquis declares his love for her; she experiences strong sexual attraction at the same time. During her return journey from Moscow to Petersburg Anna Karenina's recollections are not "interrupted by the voice of the stoker who is checking the temperature in the compartment, 'Warm, very warm, hot.'" The stoker says nothing; the words are those of Anna's inner voice. Kitty, of course, has never "rejected Vronsky" (p. 261), but was jilted by him. Surely it is his knuckles Karenin cracks, not his "nails" (the original says simply "hands"). Julie Karagina, Princess Marya's friend who later marries Boris Drubetskoy, is called Julie Kuragin (p. 350) and thus wrongly linked with the infamous Kura- gin clan (why Tolstoy chose such similar names is a question no one has addressed, as far as I know). Gustafson is inconsistent about whether in English sentences surnames of Russian women are to be given in their masculine or feminine form. We have Betsy Tverskaya and Princess Shcherbatskaya, but Dolly Oblonsky and Countess Rostov-and even, once, Count Rostova (p. 298)! Gustafson throughout has provided his own translations of Russian texts. While these are generally accurate, he would have been wise to have compared them to existing translations or consulted a native speaker, for in the passages I checked (a limited sampling), I found quite a few errors, omissions, and misunderstandings. Znameniia, "portents," is confused with znamena, "banners" (p. 112). When Nikolenka, overcome with sleepiness, squints his eyes, his mother delaetsia ne bol'she tekh mal'chikov, kotorye byvaiut v 324</page><page sequence="5">Tolstoi Made Whole zrachkakh. Ingeniously but mistakenly, Gustafson depluralizes mal'chikov and has Nikolenka himself reflected in the pupil of his mother's eye (p. 235). In fact, the "boys" are simply the tiny figures one "sees" with one's eyes shut. As Olenin rides toward the Caucasus, two Cossacks pass him, their gun cases swinging rhythmically on their backs "and their horses shuffling their white and bay legs," according to Gustafson, p. 238. In fact the horses are not "shuffling their legs" at all; loshadi ikh peremeshivaiutsia gnedymi i serymi nogami, i.e., the colors of the two horses' legs appear mixed because they are perceived as a unit. The inquisitive baba who thrusts her face out the window is not neces- sarily "old" (p. 256); the word connotes only her peasant class and married status. In a quotation from Chernyshevsky (p. 292) the present (o nastoiash- chem) has been turned into the "past." On p. 295, a Russian text is actually misquoted, with the imperfective vspominal inappropriately substituted for the perfective vspomnil of the original, referring to Praskukhin's sudden recollec- tion, on the battlefield at Sevastopol, of the twelve rubles he owes his friend Mikhailov. Although Gustafson's style is generally smooth and adequate to his sub- ject, and occasionally deft to the point of being epigrammatic, there are a few lapses and even mistakes of English grammar; he has not been very well served by his copy editor. E.g.: "it is higher than him" (p. 113); "it's [sic] reward is right now" (p. 181); "just like in the Caucasus" (p. 240); "a feeling of...rapture like he had never experienced before" (p. 361); "it was him" (p. 253); "I who is" (p. 267); "one needs not to..." (p. 271). There are non-existent words: "awakeness" (p. 316), "rakedness" (p. 234, a translation of razgul), "fictious" (p. 156), and the "Vicard of Savoyard" (sic! p. 221). Words are misused (Lossky...does not quite ascribe to the metaphysics of total unity," p. 457) or are inappropriate in formal prose ("way ahead," p. 250). There are misspellings in English (aweful, p. 342), Latin (tabula raza, p. 269), and Rus- sian (immeno, p. 342, nejastnost', p. 251). Finally, I was puzzled by a strange amalgam, "Chinese Bhrama" (p. 443). What could it be? It proved to be a gar- bled passage from Tolstoy's diary for January 30, 1906, an enumeration of deities that had become less anthropomorphic with the passage of time: "Jeho- vah, the Father (Christian), the [Hindu] Brahma, and the Heaven [Nebo] of the Chinese" (Jubilee Edition, 55:185). These blemishes, however, are only minor scratches on the surface of a monumental achievement. On a more substantive level, Gustafson's extreme monophysitism, as sug- gested earlier, does have some drawbacks. History, biography, the whole diachronic axis-these are essentially lost. In Gustafson there are not only not two Tolstoys, even the one Tolstoy is denied virtually any change or develop- ment, let alone a "crisis" that produced a fundamental transformation in his life. Everything is there from the beginning, perfect and whole. Even Tolstoy's works are only superficially multiple. In fact there is only one single Work, the massive ninety volumes-fiction, tracts, diaries, letters, everything-fused into one gigantic whole, within which there seem to be no contradictions. 325</page><page sequence="6">The Russian Review Regardless of date or genre, parts are readily interchangeable and relate easily to one another. As we have seen, episodes from Anna Karenina, interpreted allegorically, illustrate principles articulated in The Kingdom of God Is Within You. Diary entries from 1909 can be quoted alongside a letter from the 1850s in support of the same point, often without mention of the distance in time. The date essentially does not matter; Tolstoy is timeless. Quotations are mostly cited without even identifying the particular works from which they are drawn; only date, volume, and page number (from the Jubilee Edition) are given. To get any sense of the context of the quotations one must read Gustafson with the Jubilee Edition immediately at hand. Just as the devout Tolstoyan strives to lose his "personality" or individu- ality in a higher totality, so in Gustafson Tolstoy's individual works lose their personalities as they melt into the Oeuvre. For all his acute analyses of indivi- dual scenes, one cannot find in Gustafson any treatment of Anna Karenina or "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" as aesthetic entities in themselves, complete and whole. One finds instead, at widely spaced intervals, parts, scenes, characters, or motifs extracted and then juxtaposed with analogous parts from other works. Furthermore, there is something hermetic about this Oeuvre. Except for its alleged connections with "Eastern Christianity" (to be discussed below), it seems to exist in a timeless vacuum, isolated from Russia, Russian and other literatures, and the world. No influences appear to penetrate it, no literary fashions or trends. Tolstoy's contemporaries hardly cross its threshold; even those with whom he was intensely involved, such as Turgenev, Nekrasov, Dru- zhinin, Fet, and Strakhov, are mentioned fleetingly if at all. The Oeuvre may itself form part of a larger entity called Russian literature, but of this connection Gustafson has nothing to say. No doubt to explore that linkage was not part of his aim, but nevertheless, reading Gustafson one does sometimes wish for some recognition that Tolstoy was not a theological stylite alone on his pillar. The only external linkage Gustafson does systematically adduce is with the body of thought and belief he calls "Eastern Christianity." There is, of course, a paradox here. The problem is that before his "crisis" Tolstoy was never a serious student of nor believer in this body of doctrine, and after the crisis he explicitly repudiated it. Brought up in the nominal and very casual adherence to Orthodoxy characteristic of the Russian aristocracy, Tolstoy developed, after his conversion, an attitude of sharp antagonism toward the Orthodox Church and all its works, culminating in his mordant reply to its act of excommunication. Yet Gustafson time and again finds that the roots of Tolstoy's theological notions lie deep in "Eastern Christianity," and he demon- strates the connection with an impressive array of quotations or paraphrases from such latter-day adepts of Eastern Orthodox theology as Lossky, Meyen- dorff, Bulgakov, Berdiaev, and Frank. Gustafson is well aware of the paradox, but gets around it by the argument that Tolstoy's organic connection with "Eastern Christianity," was an inevit- able by-product of living in Russia. He received it, as it were, by osmosis. 326</page><page sequence="7">Tolstoi Made Whole This [Tolstoy's] theology...was not derived from scripture or any other books. The ideas emerge from Tolstoy's experience. That his ideas are shaped by the tradition of Eastern Christianity only proves the point, for Tolstoy experienced life within that tradition....His religious ideas are not a new discovery of his later years, when he consciously studied religious and theological works; his later ideas, including his understanding of such works, are the clarified articulations of what he learned throughout his years is the meaning of life and therefore the way to love (pp. 190- 91). To me this seems by far the weakest link in Gustafson's chain. I am, alas, not learned enough in "Eastern Christianity" to judge professionally the vali- dity of what Gustafson says about it; I must leave that task to others. I will, however, voice some skepticism, not only about the osmotic connection between Tolstoy and Eastern Christianity but even about the existence of the latter as a clear and distinct entity, separate from other Christianities, an identifiable unity from the Greek fathers to Vladimir Solovyov. (I am even more skeptical of the existence of another entity invoked by Gustafson, "Western Christianity," which apparently includes all of Catholicism and Pro- testantism lumped together.) Further, by way of example, I will venture the opinion that Tolstoy's views on immortality, of which Gustafson gives an excel- lent exposition (pp. 325-26), are radically at variance with those of the Orthodox Church. The notion of the timeless merging at death of the individual soul with the ultimate One seems to me to have far more in common with Buddhism than with "Eastern Christianity" as I understand it. Gustafson, incidentally, has nothing to say about the universalism that was such a marked feature of the religious explorations of Tolstoy's later years, when he read widely in the theologies of all the world's major religions and was pleased to find identical moral truths at the heart of each, though in every case distorted and corrupted by institutional churches and priesthoods and by mankind's recurrent propensity to prefer rituals and magic to moral imperatives. The greatest paradox in Gustafson, however, is implied by the title. Like Isaiah Berlin before him, Gustafson, despite his monophysitism, has perceived Tolstoy as a Janus-like figure in whom two contradictory natures are yoked together into one tumultuous self. Gustafson's images "resident" and "stranger," though not as picturesque as Berlin's hedgehog and fox, neverthe- less provide a suggestive metaphor, illuminatingly descriptive of Tolstoy's many contradictions. Tolstoy the Resident "belongs to a world harmonized into accord, made perfect because all participate together in the one song of life...The peak experience of life, the moments that reveal Tolstoy's ideal way of being in the world, are marked not by ethical action or duty, but by a sense of ecstatic love for all" (p. 9). Tolstoy the Stranger, on the other hand, "led a life estranged from the world, focused not on others but on himself...Throughout his life he not only destroyed the relationships he established, he also self- righteously and even self-pityingly blamed his resultant isolation on others...The Resident of Russia lived in fated isolation from her people" (pp. 15-17). 327</page><page sequence="8">The Russian Review The paradox, of course, is how this polarized Janus, this bundle of clash- ing contradictions, managed to produce an Oeuvre so perfectly harmonious, so unified, so free of oppositions. Gustafson never really answers this question. Of course, the magic word "dialectic" is inevitably invoked, and he does show very clearly how various fictional characters embody various aspects of "residency" or "strangerhood," including dramas of transition from the one into the other. But the theology, to which most of Gustafson's book is devoted, seems to be entirely the product of the Resident, as if the Stranger's destructive and hypercritical hostilities had been dissolved in an elixir of love and harmony. Gustafson's Stranger is essentially laid to rest early in the book, and we see few of his later manifestations-for instance the Tolstoy who sneaked away to write in secret Hadji Murat, that guilty celebration of the most blatantly anti- Tolstoyan values of tribalism, aggression, and blood vengeance. Nor does Gustafson ever evoke that "other" Tolstoy so poetically per- ceived by Maksim Gorky, the "archaic" pagan sorcerer sitting on the rocks by the waves and seeming to command them, as old and as wise as the rocks them- selves. To this Tolstoy the theology of "St. Leo" must have seemed patheti- cally ephemeral and even trivial, a fragile and futile refuge from the existential void. Gustafson's final image is of a benign, "resident" Tolstoy fundamentally at one with Dostoevsky's Father Zosima ("Estranged from Father Zosima's church and monastery, Tolstoy dwells in his universe" [p. 463]). But to me Berlin's majestic concluding sentence rings both deeper and truer: At once insanely proud and filled with self-hatred, omniscient and self-abasing, tormented and detached, surrounded by an adoring family, by devoted followers, by the admiration of the entire civilised world, and yet almost wholly isolated, he is the most tragic of the great writers, a desperate old man, beyond human aid, wandering self-blinded at Colonus.2 2 Isaiah Berlin, "Lev Tolstoy's Historical Scepticism," Oxford Slavonic Papers, 2 (1951), p. 54. 328</page></plain_text>
