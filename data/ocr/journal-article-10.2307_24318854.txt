<plain_text><page sequence="1">IUE OTKE' HWillffi ^ Editorial Day-to-Day Muralists Margarita de Orellana How often have we stopped in front of a corner store's sign, whether in a big city or a small town in Mexico, and either smiled or even laughed out loud? They would seem to be specifically directed at us in order to con vince us, all jokes aside, to enter the store and buy what it sells. These popular murals' messages are most often clear, clever and unabashed. Mexican muralists from the post-revolutionary 1930s also sought to convey a message. Their monumental frescos dis played great technical skill, pompous nationalism and often grave, irritating dogmatism. Over time, they became images venerated by Mexicans as exemplifying something transcen dent. Commercial sign painters are muralists of a different sort, diametrically opposed to the former in terms of training, techniques, interests, etc. The works of sign painters are not monumental, and they merely aim to make public—some times cleverly and sometimes with charming awkwardness— what their "sponsors" want us to know. These intuitive paint ers amuse us as much as they amuse themselves with their brazenly original designs. The muralists did not usually resort to humor, while the work of sign painters displays (sometimes involuntary) humor that is both ingenious and ingenuous. Sign painters have created a collective, anonymous imagery that is beginning to disappear. It has formed part of our cityscapes for decades. Unlike the muralists, sign painters very often use lettering of various kinds, establishing an almost organic rela tionship between word and image. Mexican Muralism was a movement that had an enormous impact on art history. The art of sign painters is indubitably an art of developing countries. In India, Egypt or Morocco, hand painted signs enliven both urban and rural settings with their colors and forms, which are well worth documenting. They have the same function as ours do, but a unique aesthetic, and their rendering is also usually uninhibited, makeshift. For some time now, many visual artists, photographers and graphic designers have documented this 'other' muralism, interpreting and reinterpreting it in their fashion. It has been the subject of several books that are in and of themselves rich sources of visual inspiration, such as Juan Carlos Mena and Ós car Reyes's Sensacional!: Mexican Street Graphics-, Enrique Soto Eguibar's Gráfica popular mexicana; Rafael López Castro's Ves tida del Sol-, Germán Montalvo's El Popo y el Ixta-, and Phyllis La Farge and Magdalena Caris's Painted Walls of Mexico. What place do hand-painted signs occupy in today's art world? Artist Francis Alys was amongst the first to use signage in his artwork. Many other contemporary artists employ it in different ways or find inspiration in it. Since the 1930s, pho tographers like Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Edward Weston and Agustín Jiménez have captured all sorts of signs with their cameras, and these images today are highly valued. With this issue of Artes de México, we wish to explore the topic, tak ing these works as a point of departure, and developing the argument in other contexts. We wish to continue analyzing signage's scope and to understand its particularities. Each text in this issue deals with certain facets of the aes thetics of signage, extending our examination of it and its place in the current art scene. José Emilio Salceda shares his feelings about the gradual disappearance of this good-natured, personal visual culture as it is replaced by the aseptic dullness of new convenience stores invading our streets, by drugstores' neon lit signs and everything else that globalization entails. From a very broad art-historical perspective, Anamaria Ashwell com pares and contrasts the concerns of Western artists since the seventeenth century with those of contemporary artists. As an anthropologist and visual artist, she discusses that "collective and anonymous form of aesthetic expression that is both dispa rate and widely dispersed, and that derived from the contagious spread and integration of the urban landscape of a 'pre-modern' Mexico." Enrique Soto Eguibar, who has spent many years docu menting hand-painted signage, shares his experience and knowl edge in the art of photographing signs from Mexico's central states. Rafael Vargas writes about another kind of signage, that of pulquerías, which fascinated Edward Weston while he lived in Mexico, and which we now have access to thanks to his pho tographs. Martín M. Checa-Artasu and Pilar Castro Rodriguez systematically explain the keys to this visual language, detailing the use of typography and showing how letters become icons that can very simply and yet boldly express what is advertised. Sign painters Manuel Velasco and Adán Navarrete tell us about the ins and outs of their trade and their heartfelt com mitment to it. Velasco continues to work today in Mexico City's historic downtown after forty years in the business. He relates how professional, skilled sign painters have lost ground against "second-rate" amateurs. Navarrete hopes to encourage the next generation to carry on with the work so the trade will not entirely vanish. Only time will tell... 65 Margarita de Orellana</page><page sequence="2">Nostalgia for Signage José Emilio Salceda Designed to communicate directly with a consumer (even when they go against the tenets of conventional graphic design), hand-painted signs transcend their status as mere commercial objects through powerful and chal lenging imagery: anthropomorphic automobiles, pigs cooking pork, crabs preparing seafood cocktails, hens wearing bikinis, skeletons eating pan de muerto (bread for the Day of the Dead), salon beauties seducing us with their garish makeup and fake glamour while whispering in our ear that they would be inca pable of deceiving us. Satirical, mordant, transgressive, sarcastic or simply funny, the images created by sign painters unconsciously and natu rally express a longstanding tradition in the history of West ern art: the representation of the grotesque as a space where the natural order and logic of things is upset by the intrusion of the absurd and the irrational. This tradition has its most ob vious roots in medieval bestiaries populated by basilisks, uni corns, onagers, dragons, hippogriffs, incubi, succubi, sphinxes, manticores and chimeras, and its projection was such that over time, it made its appearance in canvases by Velázquez, in Goya's Caprichos, in Hieronymus Bosch's Hell, and in (acques Callot's The Temptation of Saint Anthony. But the contemplation of the purely grotesque as the antith esis of beauty can only lead to loathing (and eventually to fear and horror) or to a morbid attraction (and ultimately insanity: is it mere coincidence that Diane Arbus, the great photogra pher of the human grotesque, took her own life?). Nonethe less, the signs populating the walls of our suburban surround ings invoke neither panic nor dementia. Their public nature turns them into an extravagant and sardonic caricature of the grotesque—in other words, a parody, a joke, a mockery. Street signs and advertising laugh with us and at us, but above all, they poke fun at themselves. And with good reason: with their lack of proportion and apparent anarchy, their marginal and chaotic spirit, their celebration of spontaneity and imbal ance, the popular art of sign painting is well aware of its own fragility and provisional character, and it is perhaps for this very reason that it is always carnivalesque, festive and bois terous. The visual humor, double-entendres and hyperbolic imagination employed in these images provide a glimpse of a vibrant and dynamic culture that, paradoxically, is destined to disappear. The images presented here are a respectful and lucid ac count of people's everyday lives. But they are also the evoca tion of a world where one simply had to cross the street to buy candy at a corner store, or walk a few steps to buy vegetables for dinner, or turn the corner to drop the bike off at a repair shop to have the frame soldered, or trek two blocks over to the barbershop where the hairdresser awaited, weapons at the ready, and greeted us by name. This world and its signs are gradually disappearing as the brightness of neon lights, the spotlessness of convenience stores, the bleakness of chain drugstores and their unexceptional backlit signs take over. These images evoke a time that is fast receding into the past, taking with it what remains of our memory. With a little luck, we will be left with the photographs. Translated by Michelle Suderman. CONTRADICTIONS OF INNOCENCE Paradoxes of Street Aesthetics Anamaria Ashwell Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) took a vested interest in the materials he used for his paintings. In his studio, he measured the opacity and luminosity of pigments; he covered his canvases with primers; for his painted panels, he chose the most resistant woods and reinforced them with glue. Like most great masters of Western art, Rubens also en forced certain conditions regarding the transport of his paint ings. For instance, Rubens's collected correspondence contains a letter to the Florence court painter Justus Sustermans, stating, "I fear that if the new picture remains rolled up and packed too long, then the colors could spoil, and particularly the carnation and white lead could become a little dark. Since, sir, you are so knowledgeable in the arts, you could remedy this situation by putting the picture out in the sun at intervals" (quoted by E. Ghul in The Restoration of Paintings). Interest in the pres ervation of artwork had been a priority in the painter's craft (only the fresco technique offered not only large visual planes but also apparently permanent pictorial surfaces for capturing venerated images that could theoretically last forever, though within enclosures perfectly—and hence impossibly—sealed against humidity, light and air, and only as long as the walls re mained standing). Rubens was well aware of the fact that paint ings done on any kind of cloth—whether linen, flax, hemp, silk or cotton (beginning in the sixteenth century, artists increas ingly began to use cloth instead of wood for their paintings)— begin to darken if they are rolled up or stored in a dark room shortly after painting. But they also suffer certain irreversible effects with the passage of time: colors in general become dark er, whites become yellowed, while blues and purples are muted into dark greens and browns. Every layer of paint ages irrevocably, whether the tech nique involves overlaid coats of unmixed pigments, or modern techniques of mixing colors. And time gradually destroys the painting as a whole: its cloth or wooden support, the primer, the paint itself, the binders and varnish. Likewise, expert conservators at the most important muse ums in the Western world estimate that ninety-five percent of artworks produced by past cultures have disappeared. The only works that remain from antiquity are the sculptures that were done in noble metals such as gold, platinum, palladium—and 66 José Emilio Salceda Michelle Suderman. Anamaría Ashwell</page><page sequence="3">to a lesser extent, copper and bronze, and only if they escaped being melted down to finance wars or fabricate weaponry— as well as stone carvings that remained underwater or bur ied, works that were sealed inside pyramids for four thousand years at zero humidity, and ceramic pieces (chemically simi lar to fossils) that somehow managed to avoid breakage. The few fragments of human artistic expression on cloth or wood that have survived since antiquity were only able to do so if they were somehow protected from the elements and human handling: either completely submerged in acid-free water, or isolated in a zero-humidity enclosure, or done on acid-free pa per that was never exposed to light (3000-year-old papyri from ancient Egypt that are still legible today). Certain contempo rary works may have an indefinite and perhaps infinite life expectancy—for example, if they were made with polymers or acrylics, or with radio waves, which, like light, expand in definitely. But, as Alan Weisman says in The World Without Us, works on textiles will not last for more than a few centuries, and their original color will be irreversibly altered in a very short time, no matter how many extreme precautions are em ployed to avert decay. According to Luke Slattery's In Search of Western Civiliza tion's Lost Classics, Italy's National Library in Naples contains the charred remains of the only surviving library of written works from classical antiquity, preserved—paradoxically—by the destruction of the Villa of the Papyri: a palatial structure lying beneath the modern-day town of Ercolano that was bur ied under more than thirty meters of volcanic ash during the eighteen hours that the eruption of Mount Vesuvius lasted on August 24 in the year a.d. 79, ultimately protecting the books in this Pompeii library. Fewer than half of the salvaged papyri have been studied to date, and indeed, most of the works in the library remain buried (and protected) in the same place where they have lain for 1700 years. Current technology still does not offer a safe way to read the papyri without destroy ing them forever. For this reason, a three-meter length of scroll with forty columns of Greek text still awaits deciphering after being unrolled by a device invented in 1756 by Fr. Antonio Piaggio, a manuscript conservator at the Vatican library. Ac cording to this method, silk threads were attached to the pa pyri's surface with a paste made of fish oil and then fixed in place by a slice of pig's bladder. In the meantime, the works that remain buried or half-buried at the same site—which may include some of the 300 scrolls attributed to Epicurus, piled at the foot of walls bearing frescoes of dancing cupids and sea scapes in cobalt blue, red and yellow—are under the very real threat of another eruption (seismographers sounded the alarm as recently as 1998) or of flooding. It seems that the only manmade thing that it truly makes sense to preserve is art. Does this mean that humanity sees aes thetic production as something of a higher order? Is art sim ply our gift to the world—an unexpected, symbolic, extremely rare legacy that has existed throughout human evolution? However many desperate measures we may take (a vast collection of archival documents printed on acid-free paper as well as the largest photographic archive in existence, both owned by the Corbis Agency, are now stored 200 meters under ground in subzero, humidity-free lockers in former limestone mines in Pennsylvania; if all goes according to plan, they will last 5000 years, untouched by human hands, unseen by hu man eyes), the probable survival of the human aesthetic heri tage decreases in direct proportion to the increasing amount unproductively spent on preserving it: substantial sums of money and effort are uselessly invested in an attempt to be stow on works of art an ever-elusive eternal life. In The Accursed Share, Georges Bataille said that art is like an excess of spirit: a gift of humanity that has neither rea son nor utilitarian significance. Furthermore, if art has any purpose, it resides only in itself. It is, perhaps, the product of surplus energy whose manifest value is simply that of its al most miraculous apparition. As such, it is an utterly superflu ous human product that does not stem from any innate need. It is a luxury that perhaps only faces mankind with enigmas, though they may be essential enigmas. What is more, such manifestations are rare, not only because they are perishable, but because they are the work of only a few individuals who produce pieces that are valued as works of arts based on cul tural consensuses that have evolved over many geographies and long periods of time, as explained by George Steiner in Real Presences. But it is precisely—or paradoxically—this rare, perennial condition that has contributed to the present-day reexamination and reinterpretation of art as a valuable com modity. Owning ancient or modern art is rapidly becoming a luxury available to fewer and fewer people, not only because it implies a certain degree of knowledge and a certain lifestyle, but also because it involves increasingly specialized and costly restoration and conservation technologies. Essentially, there is nothing about art that is necessary to keep ing humanity alive. However, works of art in the modern age have not only been reexamined and reinterpreted as a commod ity, but have also been put on a par with all other manufactured commodities whose value is determined by market demand: their essentially useless condition as an entirely unproductive expenditure, with no balancing factor, has been largely disre garded for a long time. Today, art is simply an object that ac quires exchange value just like any other commodity. In 1923, Marcel Duchamp (1887-1967) ceased to make what was regarded as art at that time. Art's growing commercializa tion—or rather, the exponential growth of the art market—led him to state that the end of "retinal" and "olfactory" art had come, and that he had decided to devote his time to playing chess. Seven years went by before he published the notes he had made on The Large Glass, writing that it was "a wedding of mental and visual elements in which the ideas [...] are more important than the actual visual realization [...]. My notes refer to that which happens while remaining unseen"; he also stated he wished to publish his notes "in the form of a Sears-Roebuck catalogue." In fact, this was Duchamp's way of declaring that art had to withstand modern life and resist its commodifica tion (which Bataille considered a terrible ignominy). Thus, he yielded to a modernity that valued material accumulation and that was caught up in the cycle of consuming and discarding 67</page><page sequence="4">things, even what men considered to be most sublime: art. The Large Glass, Duchamp explained, should serve as a "lighthouse to guide future ships in a civilization which is ending" (quoted by Calvin Tomkins in The Bride and the Bachelors). Modern society's ability to consume and reinterpret all art as commodity had a paradoxical effect on Duchamp's own work: in 1954, around the same time that he was gaining a certain reputation as the ultimate anti-artist, his work was being placed on permanent display as part of the Arensberg Collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1955, Life magazine coined the term "throw-away society" to describe modernity's unrestrained, wasteful consumption of all modes of production, including aesthetic ones, and including the works of Duchamp. Duchamp complained: "So many artists, so many one-man shows [...] And with commercialization has come the integra tion of the artist into society, for the first time in a hundred years. [...] In my time, we artists were pariahs. [...] But today the artist is integrated and so he has to be paid, and so he has to keep producing for the market. It's a vicious circle." Once consumer society, driven by capitalist accumula tion—or perhaps as Bataille suggested, not by accumulation but by its counterparts, which are destruction, waste and loss—begins to rule freely, it begins to reinterpret everything, including the role and function of art and artists. But artists have not stopped producing "retinal" work. Most work produced by the Expressionists or the New York action painters is a prime example of this. Though they may have seen Duchamp as their bad conscience, once the storm had passed, once they were installed in a time beyond time, they began making truly memorable pieces. Without altering the essence of art, modernity had transformed the artwork into something entirely different—or more accurately, into many different things with an infinite number of new functions. The artwork was reborn as the piece de résistance, in the words of John Cage (1912-1992)—as something noble. For example, some pieces were made out of industrial waste, with ironic, playful or ex travagant approaches which challenged the notion that money is the only real measure of art's value—i.e. the market-imposed commodification of art. In other cases, pieces that were clearly perishable were exhibited and tagged with arbitrarily elevated prices; instant art was produced under a variety of monikers (including quick art, readymades, factory art, combines, and so forth). This was art that was made very rapidly, unlike the work of the Old Masters who took great care in their handling of pigments and materials according to a form of artistic pro duction that not only required a lot of time but that aspired to eternal existence. Happenings appeared, which according to Cage, were designed to "essentially" revolutionize and over throw all the supposed tenets of Western art that had existed since the Renaissance, through a body of work born of change and constant movement (indeterminacy was the term coined by Cage), which obliterated the persona of the artist. A piece by Robert Rauschenberg (1925-2008) is perhaps the one that best attests to the creative atomization, crisis and explosion that fol lowed Duchamp's refusal to be considered an artist (and the artist's integration into a society that contaminated everything, in Duchamp's view). During the winter of 1953, Rauschenberg approached Willem de Kooning (1904-1997), whose work was among the most highly valued in the New York art mar ket at the time, and proposed to "erase" one of his drawings. Rauschenberg needed the cooperation of another artist: a re nowned artist whose work had high market value. De Kooning gave him a drawing, one that he claimed to really like: a draw ing done "with a hard line, and it was greasy too, so I had to work very hard on it, using every sort of eraser," Rauschenberg stated. When he finished erasing it, Rauschenberg hung the drawing in his studio with the inscription, Erased de Kooning Drawing (1953). Rauschenberg stated that, "painting relates to both art and life. [...] I try to act in the gap between the two." Those whose calling was art making—perhaps with an ex pressly practical attitude, or perhaps in the knowledge that an artist cannot not make work—decided that it was "masochis tic" (Duchamp's term) to continue as starving artists when the market had exponentially inflated the value of artwork. Even multinational companies' ad campaigns resorted to works of art to promote their products: around the same time that the Mona Lisa appeared on tins of sardines, Andy Warhol's studio, known as The Factory, was making paintings featuring cans of Campbell's Soup. Now divested of its uselessness, the amount of art produced actually began to increase, and artists resorted more frequently to the use of industrial and perishable materi als, thus questioning the very notion of the art object as it had been defined since antiquity. This fostered the expectation of material benefits if and when the work became successful on the art market. There was thus also an increase in the number of "readymade" artists. Modern art became an affirmation of the virtues of art's usefulness, while artists themselves shed their halo of sanctity. Thenceforth, artwork was consecrated as commodity, shedding its glory. In turn, corporations became patrons of the arts and of artists, as well as commissioning indi vidual works (Saatchi and Saatchi are a prime example of this). Furthermore, while some people spoke of "the death of art" (it is Octavio Paz who best understood his era, stating that "it is not the end of art: it is the end of the idea of modern art"), others, like Jean Tinguely, created work that focused on or celebrated the loss, waste, absurdity and destruction of the work of art in modern times (Tinguely created a machine-sculpture designed to destroy museums; it is now on display in a museum). On the periphery of the constant change and plurality that modernity introduced into art, in a place that only a few peo ple noticed (Rauschenberg's name again comes to mind), im ages with no greater purpose than selling goods or publicizing brands were painted on the facades of Mexican corner stores, but also on bicycles and cars on Mexican cities' streets during the twentieth century. A unique visual appropriation of the urban landscape began to emerge and to thrive, painted by people of all ages who did not consider themselves to be art ists, using non-durable materials and pigments (commercial latex or alkyd paints) on outdoor surfaces (unprimed, often simply whitewashed walls). In Rodando, Enrique Soto Eguibar mentions that once their popular imagery—not to mention 68</page><page sequence="5">their utilitarian function—was noticed and revalued, these im ages began to multiply exponentially, even appearing on shop ping bags or on posters for festivals, concerts, circuses, box ing matches and lucha libre, or Mexican wrestling. The fever spread to the cyclists and drivers who carried some of these images on their vehicles. The individuals who were hired to create these commercial drawings were named rotulistas, or sign painters, and their work was displayed on storefronts, res taurants, hardware stores, tire repair shops, hardware stores, bars and social clubs. The designers were the owners of these same businesses, working in conjunction with the sign paint ers themselves, and the resulting designs were used to publi cize the products and services offered. Sign painters could also be hired to decorate interiors, and many small businesses fea ture colorful idealized landscapes. Certain examples of such decoration include popular religious imagery copied from prints, while bars and brothels tended to display elaborately contorted nude and semi-nude female figures accompanied by popular sayings and double-entendres. Over time, this type of decorative painting became a kind of accessible pictorial writ ing system that was easily "read" by illiterate customers. For instance, La Michoacana ice-cream parlors featured a series of painted squares with multicolored fruit floating ethereally in space, dripping with honey, in lieu of a written menu of the different flavors of ice-cream, popsicles and fruit drinks. Paintings of pigs boiling in copper or tin stewpots, with the omnipresent wooden spoon to remove them from the broth in all their lardy glory, announced the so-called carnitas michoa canas, a type of pork taco which—like the ice cream—was la beled as a product of the state of Michoacán, even when it was produced in Puebla or Guerrero. As Soto Eguibar mentions in Gráfica popular mexicana, at a restaurant specializing in beef tacos, the painting of a bull would welcome customers into the establishment. If the image featured smiling lipsticked cows with pink, swollen udders, one could conclude that the shop sold dairy products. Time, weather and humidity added their own brushstrokes to adobe or brick walls. Hands and heads disappeared, replaced by spots and stains (more than once, I could have sworn that I had seen the shadow of the Virgin of Guadalupe amid jicamas and apples). Shrimp danced on the walls of seafood restau rants, and the entrance to a convenience store may have fea tured a Walt Disney cartoon version of Cinderella, though the sign painter's interpretation created an odd resemblance to a china poblana. Sign painters gave themselves every imag inable artistic license, given that the people hired to paint these images were more often than not just neighborhood residents who had demonstrated some degree of artistic tal ent at school. Imagination burst forth. One outstanding char acteristic of this entirely commercial, Mexican "street" design is its irreverent humor: a headless hen in a bikini "sunning" herself over a wood fire advertizes a restaurant's spit-roasted chicken, while on a butcher shop's sign, the butcher himself slices off one of his love handles and offers it up on a plate to an ogling, drooling customer who receives it with out stretched hands. Sign painters also designed decorative lettering and num bers, whether on warning signs advising people not to commit certain social indiscretions ("no spitting"), or on ads where the store's name always stood out in intricate calligraphy. Spelling mistakes formed part of the decoration, and customers rarely noticed them. A corner store named La Purificadora ("The Pu rifier") merited a certain type of decoration that might include religious images or allusions, while a charcoal-grilled ham burger stand would inspire more vernacular imagery. The most popular colors were those that could be seen from a distance and which were readily available at the closest paint store. An apple could be green or purple just as easily as it could be red. And no one took much of an interest in preserving these images, especially after a business had gone under. If the busi ness didn't fold or change hands, any damage wrought by time, humidity or constant handling could be easily repaired with a fresh base coat and a new design. Customers were never told not to lean against the signs, and graffiti was rampant, as epi thets such as puta ("whore") or phrases like Lupe estuvo aquí ("Lupe was here") were scrawled on top of each other over the years; the only thing that mattered was that the sign extolled the business owner's personality, and that he or she identi fied with it. Time also took its toll, and many walls fell into disrepair due to dampness and grime. One thing was certain: no one—not the building's proprietor, nor the sign painter— expected the sign to last for long. In time, sign painters with a unique talent for drawing would seek and eventually find spaces to create works of a more artistic bent. Landscapes featuring the ocean and the beach were especially popular in towns along Mexico's coasts. They were often framed as if they were oil paintings, and signed by the painter to distinguish them from regular adver tising. Such paintings were usually commissioned for interi or walls, though with the passage of time, exposure to light (which fades even the most resistant of colors) and the use of less-than-ideal surfaces (which could become cracked or erod ed through seepage), a different kind of aesthetic that was not intended by the painter was often introduced into the work. Until artists and photographers took notice of this kind of decoration—because as Octavio Paz once pointed out, people live immersed in and unaware of their own cultures, and never pay much attention to their forms of creative expression—no one, not even anthropologists, who are supposed to take every thing into account, gave it a second thought. Paradoxically, by the time photographers began documenting these paintings, they had already started disappearing from the Mexican ur ban landscape. This occurred because corner stores could not afford the extra cost and many of them were actually going un der as supermarkets began to take over, even in remote areas. It was also because advertising was becoming increasingly ho mogenized to conform to the demands of multinational trade marks. Sign painters also began losing business following the emergence of new technologies such as computer graphics and plotters, and with the proliferation of graffiti artists who took to the streets every night, covering every available surface with their designs. Moreover, the decoration that sign painters 69</page><page sequence="6">offered to corner stores in small towns around Mexico was increasingly associated with a commerce and lifestyle that was falling behind the times. Photographic documentation of street graphics began at a time when many sign painters were starting to use prefabricated stencils and imagery copied from television, or designs imposed and imported by car manufac turers and other corporations. The impact of Mexican sign painting or street graphics on Mexican art and Western art in general has yet to be thoroughly documented. But there is no denying that it has added some local color to contemporary architecture and decoration, and has had a strong influence on the work of many contemporary painters. The paradox lies in the fact that this aesthetic did not exert an influence on art because of any one painter's skill with the brush; nor did it emerge from one image or decoration in particular. Rather, it made the leap to contemporary art as a col lective and anonymous form of aesthetic expression that is both disparate and widely dispersed: an aesthetic which, in turn, de rived from the contagious spread and integration of the urban landscape of a Mexico that, given its ambiguity, we could still classify as "pre-modern" or peripheral. It is an archetypal Mexi co that still survives today, but that has been fatally wounded. It is impossible to imagine some of Rauschenberg's best canvases without considering the impact that this Mexican "street" aes thetic had on his vision (as in his 1990 collage, For Octavio Paz). Mexican street graphics of the type used to advertise goods sold at corner stores and hardware stores seem to hold the es sence of how, until very recently, Mexicans did business in their own fashion, and according to their own culture, within the context of a modernity that is perhaps on the wane today. It is an aesthetic created not by a single painter but by an entire people (with a few unexpected contributions from the envi ronment). While all societies count up their gains and losses as they are torn to shreds by the inexorable progress of time, these anonymous, ephemeral collective images—which never claimed to be anything but impermanent and utilitarian, and whose making was indeed dictated by commerce, which de grades art—continue to work their magic: they surprise us, make us smile, give us a sense of relief, and provide everyone, especially Mexicans, with an art education.

CAPTURING INNOCENCE A Wink on the Wall Enrique Soto Eguibar They also, after a fashion, wrote the same arguments in images and characters, and, as I have been able to confirm to my own satisfaction, the Paternoster and Ave Maria, symbols, and the general confession, all in the Indian manner, and to be sure, anyone seeing this would surely admire it; because to express the words "I confess," they paint an Indian kneeling at the feet of a priest, as if confessing, and for "to almighty God," they paint three faces with crowns, as in the Holy Trinity. José de Acosta, Historia natural y moral de las Indias (1590) Taking photographs of hand-painted signs is an activity that has consumed much of my free time and has come to form an integral part of all my travels. For years, my search for signs and other "photographable" elements has de termined the routes of family excursions. Luckily, the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Hidalgo and Veracruz, as well as Mexico City itself, have a large number of hand-painted signs which, together with those I have encountered during my explora tions of other parts of the country over the past thirty years, have allowed me to form a photographic archive of Mexican sign painting. When taking photographs in certain towns, I have sometimes felt as if I were on a stage set built expressly for someone looking for signs. There is such a vast profusion of graphics in towns such as San Pablo del Monte and all along the Puebla-Tlaxcala route that it is indeed one of the regions with the greatest number of signs, posters and examples of graf fiti that I have ever seen in my life. It bears noting that these parts of the country—including Mexico City's advertising-rich street of Ignacio Zaragoza, also known as Eje 6—are a stark example of Mexico's cultural duality. On the one hand, there is appalling ugliness, with a surfeit of cables, dirty alleyways, buses, taxis and different urban elements that are in an ad vanced state of dilapidation. On the other hand, these areas are appealingly colorful, filled with people, music, food stands, signs, graffiti, garages, hardware stores, corner stores, etc., all of which lend them their unique character. It is in these mar ginal districts of major cities where modern Mexico and its rural past live side by side, and where some of the most au thentic elements of our identity can be found today. This is also where sign painting has a real presence. Hand painted signs fulfill a number of functions. The most obvious one is to draw the attention of passers-by to a particular busi ness. Secondly, they inform potential customers as to the prod ucts or services provided by this business. Finally, they func tion as a mnemonic device allowing passers-by to associate a business's name, specialty and location with a particular image or ideogram, so that it will be the first place they think of when the need arises for a particular item or service. A sign gives a business a visual identity that does not require literacy. In Gráfica jarocha, Liza Bueno Limero quotes the owner of the La Torta sandwich shop as saying, "We Mexicans have a visual cul ture. We prefer an image to words. We don't like to read, and signs speak for themselves." Signs draw on the cultural milieu, lending businesses an individual identity, often through hu morous elements that, in my view, seek to make potential cus tomers laugh and identify congenially with the business and its owners. In these neighborhoods, unlike other urban settings, small business owners are usually well acquainted with their customers, and vice versa. Some businesses' conspicuousness obviates the need for signs, as in the case of hardware stores and butcher's shops, where posters and signs are rather decora 70 Enrique Soto Eguibar</page><page sequence="7">tive elements serving to distinguish a business from its com petitors. "For store owners, painted signs are their business's identity, and as such, it is important that the public identify closely with them, because it is often their only form of adver tising," states Bueno Limero. She goes on to quote the owner of the ABC cleaning supplies outlet, who said she felt very proud of her sign, partly because she had designed it herself, but also because her customers often complimented her on it. For her, the sign was "what gives [her store] life and gets it known." Who Paints the Signs? Sign painting is a recognized trade, and some sign painters have had formal training in drawing, usually at a technical school. Individuals who have made a career out of sign paint ing produce work that is strongly influenced by popular tradi tion as well as Disney-style cartoons. They often utilize variants on cartoon characters, but given that small-business owners often dictate what subjects should be used on their signs, there are also some professional artist-signed drawings represent ing unusual scenes: a butcher in a cauldron with pigs dancing around him, for instance. In this case, the accompanying text reads, Aquí solo mis chicharrones truenan (literally, "Only my own pork rinds crackle here," but used idiomatically to mean "I'm the boss here"), representing the thoughts of one of the dancing pigs as it stirs the cauldron of boiling oil. As a rule, professional sign painters use a tried-and-true technique: glossy enamel paint over a primed surface. These pieces are done by craftsmen with artistic training and are usually signed. However, it is common for sign painters to get their start as graffiti artists, and in this case, it becomes their oc cupation out of necessity. It is almost as if they were religious converts, since graffiti artists and sign painters are normally sworn enemies, given that the former often destroy the latter's work. Considering the cost of professionally painted signs and their relatively short lifespan, many businesses have signs de signed and painted by their owners or by some family member with a talent for drawing. These feature sometimes-outlandish representations of animals and human figures. They are never signed and are generally done with latex paint on more ordi nary surfaces, often a whitewashed wall. Between these two extremes—professional and improvised sign-painting—we find artisans of all levels, from highly cre ative and skilled individuals with a gift for drawing and com position, to those who have no background in art or drawing, but whose contributions to the genre are often memorable for their freshness and naiveté. And it is those sign-painters who fall somewhere between these two extremes who produce the most interesting work of all. Sign painting is a creative expression of societies with a great deal of cultural complexity. Some of the most interesting work in Latin America is produced in Mexico, though the phe nomenon is by no means exclusive to this country. I believe that the most direct precedent and main historical reference for sign painting in Mexico can be traced to painted ex-votos (see Artes de México 53, 2000). They also combine elements of drawing and typography, and while the lettering used on ex-votos does not usually bear any resemblance to that used on posters and painted signs, the drawing styles in these two genres are quite similar. The Signs Size, design, color and humor are the key elements in the mak ing of hand-painted signs. The design is largely defined by the type of business being advertised, providing the meaning to this image-based (or ideographic) language. At no time will we ever see a representation of a chicken at a butcher's shop, or a bull at a stationery store. With the exception of certain vari ants and some less well defined lines of business, hand-painted signs bear very precise symbolism: pigs and cows (and the occasional goat) for butcher's shops; chickens in every guise (even wearing bikinis) for poultry shops; cakes and princesses for bakeries; cars or tires for garages; Disney-influenced de signs for stationery stores; fish, shrimp and octopus (but also mermaids) for seafood restaurants; sandwiches, hamburgers and milkshakes for diners or food stands; male and female models for beauty parlors, accompanied by texts such as "Li cha Unisex Beauty Parlor—Everything in Beauty from Head to Toe," etc. There are hundreds of variations on these themes, but always within certain limits. For example, for some unknown reason, tortilla bakeries in the Puebla-Morelos region are iden tified by the iconic images of the Iztaccihuatl and Popocatépetl volcanoes, and usually go by the name of Los Volcanes. I've tried to uncover the reasons behind this, without success, but clearly, the twin volcanoes have come to symbolize tortillas in this region. In any case, there is no question that hand-painted signs present a huge variety of styles and contents which de fies any attempt at classification. As part of the project that eventually led to the publication of the book Gráfica popular mexicana (Mexican Popular Graph ics), we amassed a collection of some 5000 photographs. Ini tially, we intended to classify the signs according to the type of business they were associated with: butcher's or poultry shops, seafood stores, locksmiths, beauty parlors. But the variety was such that we gave up in defeat, opting instead to group them under headings derived from yet another element of Mexican culture: popular sayings such as Mucha pólvora y poca mecha (literally, "a lot of gunpowder and a short fuse," meaning "all talk and no action"); Mono, perico y poblano, no los toques con la mano ("Monkey, parrot and Pueblan, don't touch them with your hand," a slur against the people of Puebla); A buen en tendedor pocas palabras ("A word to the wise is sufficient"); Pa' los toros del jaral los caballos de allá mesmo ("For the bulls from Jaral, horses from the same place," meaning that the only match for a headstrong individual is someone from the same background); etc. I was always interested in art, and I lived under the illu sion—which was very widespread at the time—that pho tography was the simplest artistic expression of all. When I remember my attempts in other media in those years, I real ize that I have finally found my path. Manuel Alvarez Bravo 71</page><page sequence="8">Documenting Signs All different lines of business are represented in small towns and the outlying districts of major cities, which is where hand painted signs and posters are most ubiquitous. This is a cul tural expression associated with a working-class and lower middle-class economy. Hand-painted signs are absent from malls in more upscale parts of Mexico City, such as Polanco, Lomas de Chapultepec and Interlomas. But in districts such as Nezahualcóyotl or Tláhuac, it is difficult if not impossible to imagine a store without a hand-painted sign (though more and more of them use logos or images from Internet image banks, printed on digital plotters for a much lower cost than a hand-painted sign). Painted signs have played an important role in photogra phy, and it seems that nearly every well-known photographer has depicted a poster or advertisement in at least one of his or her works—beginning with Eugéne Atget, the pioneer of street photography, who documented Parisian storefronts in the early twentieth century, including rows of shoes for sale (Marché des Carmes, Place Maubert, 1911), as well as posters in a Parisian alleyway (Rue du Prévót, 1909). Other early exam ples include Walker Evans (Stable, 1936, and Roadside Stand, 1936); Dorotea Lange (On the Road toward Los Angeles, 1937); and in Mexico, Tina Modotti, whose Elegance and Poverty (ca. 1928), uses the sign in the background as a contrasting ele ment; and Manuel Alvarez Bravo, one of whose most emblem atic photographs, Optical Parable (1931), depicts an optician's sign, though he also took pictures of a shoe announcement (Two Pairs of Legs, 1928), and a close-up of a sign in Landscape with Gallop (1932). All of these photographs of Alvarez Bravo's use posters and signs to create a Surrealist atmosphere. We might also mention Berenice Abbott's series from the 1930s, Changing New York, which includes the pieces Lyric Theater (1936), Billboards and Signs (1936) and Advertisements (1937), among others. More recently, photographers such as Lee Fried lander (Los Angeles, 1965), Mariana Yampolsky (Mezcal, 1994) and Pedro Meyer (Calle Independencia, 1991) have made shop signage a key element of their work. An interesting phenomenon has taken place in the field of documentary photography, where signs have become the main focus of certain shots rather than being just another element within the composition. Manuel Alvarez Bravo's Polaroids se ries (ca. 1970-80) is a good example of this tendency, featuring signs in instant photographs taken face on with no extraneous elements (his Scott's Emulsion of ca. 1930 is an earlier example). Several books have been published that follow Alvarez Bravo's lead: Sensacional!: Mexican Street Graphics, 2001, Popo-Pop (2002), Gráfica popular mexicana (Mexican Popular Graphics, 2003). The first two deal exclusively with graphic art, while the third focuses more on sign-painting and small businesses. These books document and preserve this popular form of ex pression as an outcome of the reassessment that modern so cieties have made or are making of their past out of a desire to preserve their cultural diversity. In Colombia, an Internet based project named Popular de Lujo documents Latin Ameri can street graphics (www.populardelujo.com), while photog rapher Daniel Machado has documented street graphics in Uruguay, and more recently, a project entitled Tutti-Frutti has organized exhibitions in various countries of street graphics from around Latin America. The proliferation of cameras of all types has led to a mas sive growth in collections of documentary photographs, pre serving for posterity many signs and posters with surprising legends that might otherwise have been lost: "Dear customer: juice is now where the beer used to be, and water is where the liquor used to be;" "Almost new DVDs"; "House painting on site"; "No dumping garbage by non-residents of this neighbor hood"; or—a common sight in northern Mexico—a pizzeria with a sign on the door that reads, "Yes, we have pizza." Such photographs have circulated widely over the Internet, often e-mailed as PowerPoint presentations. All of these projects and publications have focused mainly on the graphic aspect of hand-painted signs, with close-cropped images that show them as mere abstractions. This lends these projects coherence, but it also eliminates the sign's context (the business it is meant to advertise), discarding a fundamen tal aspect of sign painting in the process, which is the unique character of small businesses in Mexico. The complexity and disorderliness of such businesses actu ally adds to their appeal. In my opinion, tire repair shops have a very notable presence. This may be due to the fact that they are designed to fulfill an unexpected need—the repair of a punctured tire. Their location is often announced (sometimes hundreds of meters ahead on the road) with a tire hanging from a post or tree, or with an enormous truck tire with the word talachas painted on it, advising drivers that the solution to their problem is near. The shop itself can be recognized by the sometimes-huge number of used tires piled up around it, in addition to the mechanical or hydraulic jacks lined up in front of the shop. These are often accompanied by a tangle of hoses and a tub of water. The sidewalk is generally covered in grime, grease, dust and the many different objects that can puncture a tire. But why do tire repair shops hang on to so many old tires? I can only guess that it is in hopes that some hapless car or truck driver will show up with a tire in even worse condition. The piles of tires; the shop's always-dark in terior; the jumble of hoses; the tub of water, the lug wrenches and the jacks frame a space wallowing in dust and grease. If we also happen to see a tire track forming the pattern of a feathered serpent, or a big man idly staring at the tires, and inside the shop, a poster featuring a photograph of a skimpily clad supermodel, all we have to do is frame and shoot. We can likewise imagine a butcher's shop with its cauldron, delivery bicycle, flies and dogs, and its brightly lit storefront with sides of beef hanging from the ceiling. Or the large mir rors, intense lighting and garish colors of a beauty parlor, with customers sitting in rows, heads held back, a man or woman wielding scissors beside each one. On the wall, a woman with full lips fixes her gaze on us, while a pair of flying shears deli cately snips a lock from the bangs partially covering her eyes, and one of them appears to wink seductively. Or a huge bakery window heaped with multi-tiered cakes in bright colors, deco 72</page><page sequence="9">rated with flowers and princesses in hoopskirts that look, as Anamaria Ashwell has stated, "as if they had been made out of toothpaste." These are just a few examples of the type of small busi ness whose appearance may draw its inspiration from—but also have a significant influence on—its surroundings, and which offers street photographers a unique subject. Signs breathe extra life into these businesses. They are urban el ements that contribute something to our national identity and culture. Their wealth of expressiveness, color and variety stands in stark contrast to the overwhelming uniformity of major shopping centers. Mexico's cultural complexity and piteous inequality are at the root of this urban creativity, de signed for the enjoyment of those of us who still have the op portunity to witness, capture and identify with this product of the fringes of Mexican urban culture. Indeed, it is some thing worth celebrating. Translated by Michelle Suderman. A PASSION FOR INNOCENCE Edward Weston: Pulquería Art Rafael Vargas Edward Weston arrived in Mexico City in mid-August 1923 at the age of thirty-seven, at a turning point in his art and life. Except for one seven-month interruption, he lived here for the next three years. We need not detail what Mexico meant in terms of this transition. It is enough to say that it is here that his camera became his muse or guiding light from then on. This article explores a minor thread of his life in Mexico: his fascination for the names and decoration of the city's pulquerías (cantinas serving only pulque), as recorded in the Daybook he wrote here, which has curiously yet to be published in Spanish. On August 20, 1923, Weston's first daybook entry includes a three-paragraph description of the rented house he and Tina Modotti had just moved to in the Tacubaya neighborhood; he also mentions in passing the stateliness of Mexico City's main square and cathedral, notes the lack of handsome women on the streets, and jots down his first impression of pulquerías, "these bars, in which the Indian finds solace for his lost glory, are the most colorful notes of contemporary life in the city, and the fol lowing titles evidence the Indian's romance and imagination: Sin Estudio (Without Thought) La Primavera (The Springtime) Un Viejo Amor (An Old Love) El Gato Negro (The Black Cat) Las Flores (The Flowers) La Camelia (The Camelia) La Dama Blanca (The White Lady) La Esperanza en el Desierto (Hope in the Wilderness) Sobre las Olas (On the Waves) La Perla de la piedad (The Pearl of Piety) El Asalto (The Assault) La Muerte y la Resurrección (Death and Resurrection) Las Primorosas (The Beautiful Girls) La Gloria de Juan Silveti (Juan Silveti being one of the popular toreros) Weston goes on to say, "Imagine American saloons with such names! Perhaps, if they had had them, we should never have voted the Eighteenth Amendment" (the one that ushered in Prohibition in the 1920s). We may assume by the list's length that he spent several days wandering about the streets and jotting down names, and it allows us a glimpse of Weston's sensibility for folk art and, ev idently, language. It is likely that Modotti translated the names into English, though Weston's interest in pulquerías may have been inspired by her deceased ex-husband, poet and painter Roubaix de l'Abrie Richey—whom she simply called "Robo"— through whom she met Weston. Robo had traveled to Mexico in late 1921. Fascinated by the cultural effervescence he discovered, he wrote to Weston: Here very few things do not emanate beauty. There is more po etry in a solitary figure leaning on a pulquería door at sunset, or in a copper-skinned daughter of Aztecs nursing her child in a church, than in everything you could find in Los Angeles over the next ten years of your life... Robo contracted smallpox and died in February 1922. Weston and Modotti became increasingly close. The story of their love affair is amply documented. In Mexico, the couple had a large circle of friends: Diego Rivera, Lupe Marín, Felipe Teixidor, Rafael Sala and his wife Monna Alfau, general Manuel Hernández Galván, etc. On their own or accompanied by some of the former, they explored various Mexico City neighborhoods, including La Merced and Churubusco, and made short trips to Toluca. On November 24, 1923, Weston wrote in his daybook, "A few more names noted on the pulquerías: Charros no fifís (Cowboys not Dandies), Los Hombres Sabios sin Estudio (Men Wise without Study), La Hermosa Ester (The Beautiful Esther), Mis Ilusiones (My Illu sions), Las Fieras (The Fierce Ones), El Gallo de Oro (The Cock of Gold), Alegría del Amor (The Ecstasy of Love)." On February 7, 1924, he transcribed, without any added comment, "Names of pulquerías noted in San Angel: El Vacilón de la Morena (The Jag of the Brunette), El Gran Mareo (The Great Seasickness), Las Buenas Amistades (The Good Friend ships), La Atrevida (The Daring One), Al vuelo (In Flight)." Weston's interest in pulquerías was not limited to document ing their names' wit and irony. He also liked their joyful, naive murals, and enjoyed drinking pulque, "that agreeable mild intoxicant." On February 24, 1924, he traveled to Toluca, invited by Hernández Galván to see a charro (horsemanship) demonstra 73 Rafael Vargas</page><page sequence="10">tion, after which they feasted on "mole de guajolote, tortillas and pulque, plenty of pulque, so we were all very jolly..." Indeed, while he lived in Mexico, Weston developed a fond ness for two things: bullfights and pulque. On March 12, 1924, he wrote: I have always had the desire to frequent the pulquerías, to sit down with the Indians, drink with them, make common cause with them. Two things have held me back. First, most of them are dirty! I don't mind a little dirt! But even stronger is my second reason for hesitating; I feel my presence would be re sented, even to the point of my landing in the street. Imagine sauntering into the pulquería named Charros no Fifís, wear ing my knickers and carrying my cane! However, Tina and I came across a pulquería on Insurgentes: it was quite clean and almost empty. We went in and enjoyed not only the idea of drinking together in a pulquería but the delicious pulque as well, which this time was cured with pineapple. Two months later, Weston and Modotti moved to 42 Veracruz Street, at the corner of Durango. In his entry for March 16, Weston writes, "Under my window is a palatial and preten tious home. It is not quite human. I'd prefer a pulquería..." A week later, he wrote his daybook's most memorable entry on the subject of pulquerías. After he and Modotti took a walk behind the National Palace, which led them to the marvelous church of the Holy Trinity and its Chur rigueresque fagade, they came across "several examples of contemporary decoration which excited our aesthetic senses quite as profoundly, if differently; they were pulquerías. Assur edly there must be a 'school' of pulquería painting, for though diverse, they have the same general trend in color, effect and design." He adds: If Picasso had been in Mexico, I should feel that he must have studied the pulquería paintings, for some are covered with geo metrical shapes in brilliant primary colors to excite the envy of a European modernist. These paintings, which include every possible subject, beautiful women, charros, toreadors, Popo' and Ixtaccihuatl, engines and boats, are the last word in di rect naive realism. With the titles emblazoned over the doors, imaginative, tender, or humorous, one has in the pulquería the most fascinating, interesting, popular art in modern Mexico City. The record of pulquería names he had begun since his first day afoot in Mexico City is noteworthy not so much for its length, as it only contains about fifty entries, but rather for its constancy. One day he might jot down only one, "La Gran Turca" (The Great Drunk). On another—for instance, on March 26, a day after his birthday—half a dozen: "Acuérdate de Mí (Remember Me), Vamos de Nuevo (Let's Go Again), El Corazón del Maguey (The Heart of the Maguey), Horas de Consuelo y de Olvido (Hours of Consolation and Forgetful ness), La Reforma de la Providencia (The Reform of Provi dence), Me Estoy Riendo (I Am Laughing)." Weston recorded more names than images. Of all th pul querías he undoubtedly beheld, he took pictures of very few. The Center for Creative Photography in Phoenix, Arizona only conserves a series of about twenty, all taken in 1926, at the explicit request of Diego Rivera and Anita Brenner. Thanks to Modotti, Weston met Rivera three days after settling into their house in Tacubaya. By then, Weston had al ready seen some of Rivera's murals and was fully aware of his skill and importance as a painter, considering him, to quote his daybook, "sincere and genuine." Rivera liked Weston's straightforwardness and candor. They soon became friends and mutual admirers. They were both fond of folk art, indu bitably including the hand-painted signs and murals of pul querías. These common tastes seem to have quite naturally led them to work together. The collaboration took place in Frances Toor's magazine Mexican Folkways (issue 7, June-July 1926). Rivera wrote an essay entitled "The Paintings of Pul querías" whose Spanish and English versions were illustrated by Weston's photographs. In the first part of his essay, Rivera writes, "The painters of 'pulquerías,' the workmen painters and decorators, who are hired to apply the craft they possess in all the splendor of its nobility—from the smooth surface, the well traced lines, the well drawn letters with well raised volume, to the puppet-like figures that exhibit the true height of the craft—fully comply with their commission..." In the second, shorter section, he refers to pulquerías' names—"If the painting of pulquerías is of capital importance in visual art, then their names constitute the best Mexican syn thetic poems"—and lists over thirty of them, some of the same ones that Weston jotted down in his daybook. Ten of Weston's photographs complement Rivera's essay. Those most worth mentioning are La novia (The Bride), La Palanca (The Lever) and Los Changos Vaciladores (The Playful Monkeys), a pulquería that Alejo Carpentier also refers to in his novel Reasons of State. It seems that Weston took all the photographs for this arti cle on a single day—Tuesday, June 1, 1926, whose correspond ing daybook entry reads: I was surrounded immediately by a rabble of gaping, gesticu lating men and boys, mostly ragged Indians. Perhaps many had never seen such a big camera, not in action, certainly not pointed at their special haunt, the pulquería. They pressed close, interfering, but not intentionally, though I feared they would not understand the spirit in which I worked and cause me trouble. We went to some eight or ten carefully chosen pulquerías— Frances, Diego and I, to make records for an article Diego had written for the Folkways. I have enthused before over the pulquería—my feeling has been sustained. The aspiring young painters of Mexico should study the unaspiring paintings—popular themes—popular art—which adorn the humble and often—most often—filthy pulquería. This he should do, instead of going to the degraded impotent art of the self-glorified academician. 74</page><page sequence="11">I photographed brave matadors at the kill—white veiled ladies, pensive beside moonlit waters—an exquisitely tender group of Indians—Diego himself could not have done better—and all the pictured thoughts, nearest and dearest to the heart of the people. ACCOUNTS OF INNOCENCE Sign Painter by Trade Manuel Velasco, interviewed by María Luisa Cárdenas In 1926, Alfonso Pruneda, rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, asked Anita Brenner to undertake re search on Mexican folk art. She, in turn, asked Modotti and Weston to illustrate her writings, published three years later as Idols behind Altars. Weston took over 150 photographs for this project, only a fraction of which appear in the book. There are no more than three pictures of pulquerías: Los Amores de Cupido (Cupid's Loves), Un Rato (A While), and perhaps Weston's most often reprinted shot of these establishments, El Charrito, bearing the slogan, "exquicite (sic) pulques from the best haciendas on the plains of Apan," and a painting of a horseman who has just dismounted, saluting the viewer with a glass of pulque. On Sunday, October 4,1926, Weston wrote in his daybook: Jean, Brett and I went pulquería photographing for Anita's book. I dreaded the day—even the day before. The pulquerías are always in crowded sections; closed Sundays, yet in their shadow the habitués linger, perhaps because some small side door may be ajar, or perhaps from habit. It seemed difficult to find just the right ones to illustrate the point. One week a fine example is noted, the next week it is gone—repainted or painted out, or covered with posters. These fine examples of popular art are treated with scant re spect. Too, many new paintings are in bad taste! The 'art of pulquería painting' is in decadence. Nothing untoward happened for a time, but just as I heaved a sigh of relief that we were out of the crowded, tough districts, and set up in a quite respectable, quiet street, an unpleasant incident took place. A Mexican of the middle class, really quite a fifi, accosted us. He was boiling with hardly suppressed an ger. We were to use such pictures to ridicule Mexico, to show her worst side to the Americans—and so on. Words with such people are futile, but Jean argued, then became sarcastic. "You think the Teatro Nacional is a finer expression?"—which natu rally he did! I thought he would use personal violence, but he hurried half running away—"to get a gendarme," so I has tened the exposure and we were off. But such people form the mass, the world over—except, in Mexico, they seem a bit more touchy. This is Weston's last annotation on the subject of pulquerías in his daybook before his definitive departure from Mexico on Monday, November 9, 1926. We know, from his own ac count of it, that he was carrying in his luggage two pulque jugs from Oaxaca made of burnished black clay: one in the shape of a lion with a large mane, the other, a mermaid decorated with flowers and leaves, who "lures the mariners to destruc tion with an orange and a black guitar." Translated by fill Derais. Painted signs cover the city's walls with their creativ ity, quirky style and bright colors, making the practi tioners of this trade the designers of urban space. In many cases, the occupation was passed down through the generations and those who practice it today are well aware of the importance of their work in a country where sophisti cated ads and major brand names occupy much of the space given over to advertising. One of the heirs to the culture of street graphics is Manuel Velasco, who at the age of sixty-one is still doing what he likes best: painting signs. Dressed in jeans and a plain shirt, his paint-covered hands are what give him away as a sign painter. He grew up in Guadalajara, where he worked as a street ven dor. On occasion, he would accompany his father on jobs when people commissioned signs from him. They would take the bus to wherever the work was to be done, and even though the trip itself never lasted more than twenty minutes, it was awkward because they had to carry boxes of paint, brushes and pails. But the pressing need to earn a living helped lighten their load. At his workshop, surrounded by the same materials that he used back then, Velasco reminisces: "I was taught by my father. He was also a painter. He was working in Puebla painting ads for Pepsi Cola. He'd paint entire storefronts: there was one on every corner. When school got out for summer vacation, I would spend my time with him." After his father's death, Manuel Velasco was forced to leave school and go to work. But his family's difficult financial situ ation meant that he had to move to Mexico City at the age of thirteen, where he apprenticed at a sign-painting workshop. "When I got here I decided to keep working in the same trade, because I had already had some practice at it. As an apprentice, you learn things gradually, just like in the guilds of the past." Now he has a workshop on República de Perú Street in the heart of Mexico City's historic downtown. He has been there for more than twenty years, and has a long list of satisfied customers who keep coming back because of the quality of his work and his professionalism. But Velasco realizes that not all sign painters have the same work ethic he does. "If the custom er doesn't know much about it, a painter can slap on any kind of lettering, and take shortcuts like leaving out the borders and shading. They just do it any old way. That's what distinguishes one sign painter's work from another's. It's important to know the different typefaces, to decorate them and make them stand out. You also have to know about measurements to make logos with the right proportions." He works alone, and recognizes that sign painting is not the only trade that has suffered a decline in modern times. He says that people are more interested in how much they'll earn rather than how much they'll learn, unlike in the past, when parents apprenticed their children so they could acquire 75 fill Derais. Manuel Velasco, interviewed by María Luisa Cárdenas</page><page sequence="12">a trade, even if they didn't receive any payment for it. In his family the sign-painting trade will end with Manuel Velasco. "I have a thirty-year-old son, but I didn't want him to work in this. I brought him to the shop when he was just a boy, and told him that he could learn this if he didn't want to study, but he decided to stay in school. And like I say, young people are lazy He's not going to carry that heavy ladder for me, or stand in the sun painting some storefront." The street called República de Perú used to be famous for the large number of sign painters' workshops on it. All kinds of work was done there, using a wide variety of materials on different supports, including sheet metal, cloth, walls or deliv ery vans. Even crosses were sometimes painted to mark graves. Back then, everyone knew that the best sign painters were to be found on República de Perú, but time took its toll on the area, as Velasco himself is quick to admit. "With so much rob bery, so many muggings, so many protests and marches, peo ple go elsewhere. There are only three sign-painting shops left on this street, and at any given moment another one will go under. There are fewer and fewer good sign painters, and the new ones just don't have what it takes. They're really second rate. It used to be that sign painters were highly skilled." Maestro Velasco usually works on tarps and canvas; rarely is he asked to work on metal, because the government banned metal signs some years ago. And even though his life is now largely a matter of scaffolding, ladders, tarps and paint cans, he still recalls the techniques and materials of the trade as it was practiced in the past. "We used a lot of different materials. Bank signs were done in gold leaf, which was sold in sheets. That kind of work was very expensive, so it isn't done any more. I only saw how it was done—I didn't actually do it my self. The center of the letters was gold, and I helped to outline them in black. We also worked with tin leaf, which also came in sheets. We'd apply it to a glass pane and cut it carefully with knives and squares. The pricelists in public bathhouses were done in tin leaf, as were doctors' names on their office doors or windows." Manuel Velasco has done countless jobs for a wide variety of customers, including the Ministry of Education, the teach ers' union and the Mexican Regional Workers' Confederation (crom), as well as a number of ads for local businesses. He es pecially remembers one commission he received for an exhibi tion at the Railway Theater: a huge tarp he painted with a sea scape. In such cases, customers are usually quite specific about their requirements, but the experience and practiced eye of a good sign painter are essential to doing quality work. After over forty years in the trade, Manuel Velasco is well aware that accidents happen frequently in his line of work. "Once, in Ciudad Guzmán, Michoacán, a can of paint fell right on top of me. I had hung it from the top of the ladder and it fell right off. You can imagine. A can full of sky-blue paint dripping off me the whole way back to the hotel." When I asked him about the future of sign painting, he an swered quickly, as if he had already thought about the subject many times: "Everything will be computerized, but obviously you can't work on a wall that way. Now the large billboards are done on tarps, but we used to do them on scaffolds. The people who used to get up there and paint signs are out of work now. This is an endangered occupation. Like good cabinetmakers: there are hardly any of them left, because people won't pay for skilled work. I would never recommend that anyone become a sign painter nowadays because it's a dying art." Manuel Velasco still gets around by city bus, like he did when he accompanied his father to work five decades ago. Per haps with a little less stamina but with the same enthusiasm he had as a child, he travels through Mexico City's streets car rying the tools of his trade. He tries to take only what is abso lutely necessary, because he knows that public transportation is much more involved than it used to be and he'd rather avoid bothering other commuters. No matter how grinding the daily routine seems, and de spite the long hours in the sun, he can't imagine life without his work: "I've been doing this for more than forty years. I like sign painting and as long as God gives me the strength, I'm going to keep doing it with the same enthusiasm. The joy I get out of my work is more important than the money I earn. After such a long time, you get attached to it." Like many other professions, the work of an artisan speaks for itself, and the signs that Manuel Velasco paints are his best letter of introduction. On his current to-do list there is a tarp for the La Prensa newspaper, now in his workshop with the design sketched out in pencil, ready for paint. And despite the current economic crisis and modernization, there will surely be many more jobs for his company, Rótulos Velasco. Translated by Michelle Suderman. ACCOUNTS OF INNOCENCE Signs for All Occasions Adán Narvarte, interviewed by Giovanni Troconi "T"ve been a sign painter for sixteen years. It's a good I job, but it's not for everyone. There's a trick to it, a technique. There are actually very few people who do really visually interesting work. I started apprenticing at a workshop on Insurgentes Norte in 1986, watching how the master-craftsmen worked there. I started to learn the different techniques from them—how to outline the typeface, how (and why) to use a chalk line for measuring. I was intrigued, so I practiced for one year, and that's how I learned. You gradually start to develop a style of your own, to come up with new ideas, to play around with the colors, the designs, the lettering. There are certain typefaces that you have to modify a little, give them your own twist. When you're just getting started, the job can be a little boring, because you're so desperate to learn, but sign painting is mainly a question of practice. Your greatest weap on is patience, like at school. "Where do I get my typefaces? There are Mecanorma cata logues with some of the typefaces. The classic ones are Gothic, 76 Adán Narvarte, interviewed by Giovanni Troconi</page><page sequence="13">manuscript, Helvetica and block lettering. Those are the ones you have to learn. You have to add some movement to this kind of lettering, to make it stand out. I come up with my own typefaces, and I have some original ones that I like to use when I can. People used to put a little more imagination into their work, but that's been lost. Sign painting may eventually disappear as a trade, but there are still those who want their storefronts painted, especially in big cities; there's more sign painting there than in small towns. What I would like to hap pen in terms of sign painting is to leave my mark, so the tradi tion isn't lost, and survives for many more years. I want chil dren to enjoy this kind of work, teach them so they can carry on with the tradition. Because we won't be around forever. We want someone to follow in our footsteps, so sign painting can continue to be the tradition it was in the past." Translated by Michelle Suderman. INNOCENCE EXPLAINED Let the Walls Speak! Martín M. Checa-Artasu and Pilar Castro Rodriguez Mexican cities today are made up of a whole series of graphic landscapes, which vary according to shift ing tastes in publicity and marketing, the influence of rebellious expressions from certain groups—graffiti being one example—and the many different ways of communicat ing the thousand and one aspects of city life. The result is a high level of graphic contamination, an excess of messages whose meaning must be interpreted, and a heterogeneous vi sual congestion. Street graphics are situated in the midst of this communicational maelstrom. Street graphics or popular graphic art is an eminently ur ban, mutable and ephemeral means of communication that has until recently been highly underrated. Nonetheless, it ful fills the need to communicate of a wide spectrum of society (hence the adjective popular, of the people). Text is one of the most important aspects of street graphics, with an emphasis on typography. Figurative drawings or cartoons are another key element. There are two other aspects of this form of popu lar expression: color and the surface on which it is executed— in other words, a wall. Sign painting on buildings, walls and rolling metal doors serves to communicate a wide range of information: commer cial advertising, political messages, information on govern ment programs and ads for concerts. In many cases, graphic art transcends its functional applications, introducing ele ments that express humor, irony, desire, vanity, subtle refer ences to sexuality, and so forth. As we can see from Juan Carlos Mena and Oscar Reyes's book Sensacional!: Mexican Street Graphics, handmade signs are a cultural expression bereft of academic conventions con cerning composition, though they often demonstrate great skill in terms of drawing, typography and design. The art form has its own style and aesthetic criteria, embracing all forms of pub licity and the communication dynamics of consumer society. Though they are a working-class invention, street graphics are also exploited by anyone needing to communicate with this segment of society, such as politicians, or entrepreneurs who use them to publicize their companies and products, and even by schools that paint their programs of study on a wall. According to Néstor García Canclini in Culturas híbridas. Estrategias para entrar y salir de la modernidad, street graph ics are also the perfect example of a cultural hybrid, given that they make use of the global mass media's tools and messages while appropriating symbols from the world of high art, mod ifying and adapting them to convey a consumerist message. With this assimilation, hand-painted signs create easily read able and believable, but nonetheless nuanced messages. Street Graphics around the World According to designer América Sánchez, who in May 2007 co ordinated the exhibition Tutti Frutti: Street Graphics and Cul tural Diversity, this phenomenon is not exclusive to cities. It is a virtually global form of expression that reveals the world's cultural diversity. Sign painting was prevalent in Old World cities as early as the mid-seventeenth century, and it would remain a common trade well into the twentieth century. In the late nineteenth century, text painted on walls became associated with graphic and poster design as street graphics progressively migrated from walls to paper, though wall-painted signs coexisted with poster design until the mid-twentieth century, when new forms of advertising such as billboards, tarps, specially-equipped street furniture, light boxes and led displays began to appear in urban settings. In the meantime, as design became a field of study in its own right, designers began developing new theo retical concepts in visual design, and new techniques derived from the advent of new technologies and digital media. The growing number of available supports, techniques and concepts led to the gradual disappearance of what we have defined as street graphics or handmade signage in the West ern world. As a result, such work has become increasingly rare, and is often identified with a nostalgic revival, inspiring graphic designers and visual artists to publish compilations and catalogues. Documentation of Street Graphics in Mexico In recent years, there have been a number of attempts at a re vival of street graphics in Mexico. One of the most notewor thy among them is the publication coordinated by designers José Carlos Mena and Óscar Reyes: Sensacional!: Mexican Street Graphics, an exhaustive compendium of handmade signage from central Mexico published in book form. This pioneering work is valuable in that it is nuanced and pro vocative, but it lacks a comprehensive analysis of the issue and errs in its attempts to lump all kinds of visuals issuing from urban Mexican contexts under the single heading of street graphics. 77 Martín M. Checa-Artasu and Pilar Castro Rodríguez</page><page sequence="14">Four other works that are also essentially photographic compilations have appeared in recent years. The first, Popo-pop. Imágenes de la urbe volcánica by Germán Montalvo, captures everyday scenes that feature depictions of the Popocatépetl vol cano, one of Mexico's most representative symbols and a recur ring icon on the walls of schools, houses and butcher's shops, as well as in bottled water ads, on buses and at convenience stores. The second on the list is university professor Enrique Soto Eguibar's exhaustive compilation Gráfica popular mexi cana, the result of twenty years of research by the author featur ing a selection of the thousands of photographs in his collection; it shows the ephemeral nature of street graphics and allows the image to speak for itself, attesting to this genre's richness. The third work is photographer Rafael López Castro's Vestida del sol, which contains a vast series of pictures of the Virgin of Guadalupe painted on walls around Mexico. The fourth and most recent of these publications is Painted Walls of Mexico by American writer and publisher Phyllis La Farge and Swedish photographer Magdalena Caris (2008), a compilation of street graphics from Mexico City and the states of Yucatan and Vera cruz with a colloquially-written text reminiscent of travel writ ing. This book's merit lies in the fact that it plucks certain sign painters out of anonymity, and that it attempts to clarify the meanings of Mexican street graphics. In many cases, Mexican street graphics have also been a source of inspiration for new typefaces, especially in digital media. According to Ignacio Peón, perhaps the most success ful example of this is the magazine Tiypo, with eleven issues containing fonts created by young Mexican designers. These include some that are directly derived from street graphics, in cluding the Santa Clara typeface, based on hand-painted signs in downtown Puebla, or the Luchita Payol, a font derived from lucha libre (Mexican wrestling) posters printed with hand-cut linoleum-block movable type, which reproduces the textures and imperfections of printing on low-quality paper. In sum, there have been two major lines of investiga tion until now with regard to street graphics in Mexico: first, compilations intended to preserve its aesthetics and value as heritage, and second, the reutilization and reinterpretation of hand-painted sign typography in digital media. Sign Painters In his article "La escritura en la calle," Gabriel Suárez Bayona says that street graphics, in their various forms, are the work of anonymous professionals with an instinctive know-how of art and design. They are the unseen individuals who decorate, illustrate and signpost the buildings, walls and doors of cities and towns. From a position of relative anonymity, they respond to the demand generated by an extraordinarily diverse clien tele with work whose common purpose is to communicate in order to sell a product or service. These creative individuals hide behind such descriptive terms as rotulista or sign painter, calligrapher, printmaker or painter. They are the makers of the graphics that decorate our cityscapes. There are certain key elements in the work that they do: the use of a variety of typefaces done freehand; realistic drawings of a wide variety of everyday objects; copies of popular car toon characters; attempts at caricature; and the unrestrained use of bright contrasting colors. They exercise their profes sion out in the open but go unnoticed even when working on the street, leaving their mark on the neighborhood. Each one has a distinctive, readily identifiable style. Some are better at lettering, others at realistic renderings, while still others excel at cartooning. Most sign painters are employed by workshops, which somewhat help guarantee the continuance of this centuries old craft. They are professionals who learned their trade in the time-honored guild system, rising through the ranks from apprentice to journeyman to master craftsman, acquiring skills—e.g. singular expertise in drawing and lettering—as well as practice based on direct apprenticeship and system atic repetition. Serigraphy was a new technology that the sign painting in dustry was able to incorporate—not so digital graphic design, which threatens the survival of this trade, creating a need for the revaluation and preservation of street graphics. Drawing: The Heart of Street Graphics Laughing pigs, frowning chickens, dour calves, talking keys, jubilant shrimp, juicy fruit, succulent cakes, mouth-watering sandwiches, stereotypical coiffed heads, tough musclemen, perfect sparkplugs, shiny new axles, cartoon characters carry ing out unlikely tasks and a long list of other examples come together to create a mishmash of images and letters that in vade the walls of cities. These images are clearly the heart and soul of street graphics, giving it its essence and meaning. In terms of technique, they range from nearly identical copies of logos, trademarks or cartoon characters, to figures that are original, one-of-a-kind creations. Such diversity makes it seem impossible to come up with a system to categorize this form of graphic art. True, it is not a simple thing, but we believe that most street graphics can be grouped into five major categories. The first consists of images drawn from or inspired by the world of cartoons and comics. The use of this kind of element is viewed with a degree of fa miliarity and humor by customers. It is particularly common on the facades of daycare centers and elementary schools, but can also be seen at other places of business, always with a hu morous tone. Cartoons are also likely a demonstration of the sign painter's precision and skill. The second is the use of human figures, always as carica tures. This type of drawing allows the sign painter to establish a more personal connection with the intended audience. An example of this would be happy children playing on the walls of a daycare center or nursery school. There is a subcategory here which includes the realistic portraits seen outside beauty parlors and barbershops—figures with saccharin faces and impeccable hairdos, reminiscent of a cosmetic company's pro motional photographs. A third group includes drawings of caricaturized everyday objects and animals. In nearly every instance, they communicate a sense of humor and irony. They appear in an incredible vari 78</page><page sequence="15">ety of contexts, in diverse poses and activities, at butchers' shops, locksmiths, seafood restaurants and any number of food outlets. The fourth group revolves around the representation of food and drink. These images are common in delis, produce stores, juice stands, taco stands, corner stores, etc. They serve as graphic emphasis for several lines of text describing the range of products, allowing customers to see at a glance what options are available. The fifth and final group includes images of machinery, tools, construction materials or auto parts. These are common in establishments such as garages, auto parts distributors, tire stores, locksmiths' shops, heavy machinery sales-and-rental outlets, construction material distributors, lumberyards, etc. The artistic merit of these images is evident in the large-format yet precise representation of very small objects, including nuts and bolts; or medium-size objects such as shock absorbers, circular saws, car batteries, etc. They aim to show potential customers that the establishment's clerks are well versed in the use of the different objects depicted, whether they be ma chines or tools. Lettering: A Key Element of Communication In examples of street graphics found in Mexican cities, the pres ence of lettering is practically universal, given that it is an essen tial part of the message to be communicated. While images may have a greater visual impact and serve to emphasize the written message, they would not make much sense on their own. According to Ricardo Huerta in his book Museo tipográ fico urbano. Paseando entre las letras de la ciudad, lettering is much more than written language: it is synonymous with creativity in its desire to convey a message. There is one ob vious fact about the graphic arts: lettering not only defines the graphic space of words and language, but also becomes an aesthetic element that decorates walls and streets. In this metamorphosis, letters no longer pertain to written language but rather to the urban context, and this explains how the city itself is acknowledged and reappraised in lettering. Lettering on handmade signage is rendered freehand in a wide range of styles. According to Suárez Bayona, sign paint ers in general seem unhindered by the norms of academic design concerning typography and its compositional, struc tural or stylistic elements. This becomes clear in the final re sult, which often displays a certain lack of scale. Sign painters rarely seem to take into account the length of the phrase, the spaces between letters, words and lines, or the proper manner of dividing words. Most of them use very simple lettering, yet in a great diversity of styles. In many cases, letters' stems and arms are painted in bright colors or with gradations of color. In others, painterly effects give the impression of either high or low relief. The letters' measurements often vary within a single word or line, becoming more compact or narrow to fit the space of the panel. The strokes may be fine, medium, semi bold or bold. One might say that in most cases, such varia tions are applied according to the requirements of the work as judged by the sign writer, based on space, message and the customer's needs. The variability of lettering results in a visual feast that is only possible through the skilled use of calligraphy, which the sign writer learns over time through practice. The functional result seeks maximum legibility, clarity and simplicity. With the addition of images to the written text, the convey ance of the desired message comes full circle. Possible inter pretations are thus left up to the viewer, and they, in the end, are what define the true dimension of street graphics. Translated by Michelle Suderman. The Storm Shifts the Signboards Hans Christian Andersen (1865) In olden days, when Grandfather was just a little boy and wore red trousers, a red jacket, a sash around his waist, and a feather in his cap—for that's the way little boys dressed in his childhood when they wore their best clothes— so many things were different from nowadays. There were often street pageants, which we don't see now, for they have been done away with, because they became old-fashioned; but it's fun to hear Grandfather tell about them. It must have been quite a show to see the shoemakers move their signboard when they changed to a new guild hall. A big boot and a two-headed eagle were painted on their waving silk en banner; the youngest journeymen carried the welcome cup and the guild chest, and had red and white ribbons dangling from their shirt sleeves; the older ones wore naked swords with lemons stuck on the points. They had a full band, and the best of their instruments was "The Bird," as Grandfather called the long pole with the half moon and all sorts of sounding, dingle-dangle things on it—real Turkish music. It was lifted up and swung, and it was dazzling to the eyes when the sun shone on all that polished gold and silver and brass. In front of the procession ran a harlequin in clothes made of many-colored patches, with a black face and with bells on his head, like a sleigh horse. He struck the people with his wand, which made a noise without hurting, and the people pushed against each other to move back and forth; little boys and girls fell over their own feet right into the gutters; old women el bowed their way along, looking sour and scolding. Some peo ple laughed and some people chatted; there were spectators on the steps and in the windows, and, yes, even on the roofs. The sun shone; a little rain fell on the people now and then, but that was a good thing for the farmers; and when finally they became wet through, that was a real blessing to the country. Ah, what stories Grandfather could tell! When he was a little boy he had seen all that grand show at the height of its splendor. The oldest guild journeyman made a speech from the scaffold where the signboard was hung; it was in verse, just like poetry— which, indeed, it was. There had been three of them working on it, and before writing it they had drunk a whole bowl of punch, so that it would be really good. And the people cheered the 79 Hans Christian Andersen</page><page sequence="16">speech, but still more they cheered the harlequin when he ap peared on the scaffold and mocked the speaker. The clown cut his capers so gaily, and drank punch out of schnapps glasses, which he then threw out among the people, who caught them in the air. Grandfather had one of them, which the plasterer had caught and presented to him. Yes, it was fun. And at last the signboard hung, decked with flowers and wreaths, on the new guild hall. You never forget a sight like that, no matter how old you grow, Grandfather said. He himself never forgot it, though af terward he saw many things of pomp and splendor and could tell about them; but the funniest thing of all was when he told about the moving of the signboards in the big town. Grandfather had gone there with his parents when he was a little boy, and that was the first time he had seen the largest town in the country. There were so many people in the streets that he thought the signboards were going to be moved; and there were many signboards to move. If these signs had been hung up inside instead of out-of-doors, they would have filled up hundreds of rooms. There were all kinds of garments painted on the sign at the tailor's; he could change people from uncouth to genteel. There were signboards of tobacconists, with the most cunning little boys smoking cigars, just as in real life; there were signs with butter and salted herrings, minister's ruffs and coffins, and signboards that just carried inscriptions and announcements. Indeed, one could spend a whole day going up and down the streets and looking at the pictures, and at the same time you could learn what sort of people lived inside the houses, for they had hung their own signs outside. That is a very good thing, Grandfather said; in a large town it is instruc tive to know who lives in all the houses. But then, something was about to happen to the sign boards, just as Grandfather came to town; he told me about it himself, and there wasn't then any twinkle in his eye, as Mother used to say there was when he was fooling me; he looked quite trustworthy. That first night he came to the big town, the weather was worse than any we have ever read about in the papers—a storm such as there had never been within man's memory. All the air was full of roof tiles; old wooden fences were blown over; a wheelbarrow even ran for its life by itself along the street. The wind howled in the air; it whistled and it shook everything. It was indeed a terrible storm. The water in the canal ran over the banks, not knowing where it belonged. The storm swept over the town, carrying the chimneys with it; more than one old proud church tower bent, and has never been quite straight since. A sentry box stood outside the house of the honest old fire chief, whose en gine was always the last one at the fire; the storm begrudged him that little box and flung it down the steps and rolled it along the street until, strangely enough, it arose and remained upright before the 80 house of the poor carpenter who had saved the lives of three people at the last fire. But the sentry box didn't give that a thought. The barber's signboard, a large brass dish, was torn off and carried across into the councilor's window. All the neighbors said this seemed almost like malice, for they, like the most intimate lady friends of the family, called the mis tress "the Razor"—she was so sharp, and knew more about people than they knew about themselves. A sign with a dried codfish drawn on it flew over to the door of a newspaper writer. That was a pretty poor joke on the part of the storm; it probably didn't remember that a news paper writer isn't the sort of person to be joked about; he is a king in his own paper and in his own opinions. The weathercock flew over to the roof of the opposite house, and there it remained—a picture of the darkest wicked ness, said the neighbors. The cooper's barrel was hung just under the sign for "La dies' Apparel." The restaurant's menu, which hung in a heavy frame near the door, was placed by the storm just over the en trance to the theater, where nobody ever went. It was a com ical program, "Horseradish Soup and Stuffed Cabbage," but it made people go in. The furrier's fox skin, which was his respectable sign, was hung on the bellpull of the young man who always went to morning church services looking like a folded umbrella, strove for the truth, and was "a model young man," said his aunt. The sign "Establishment for Higher Education" was moved to the pool hall, and the Establishment itself received a board inscribed, "Babies Brought up Here by the Bottle." This wasn't really witty, only naughty; but the storm did it, and we can't control a storm. It was a terrible night; and by morning, just think, nearly every signboard in town had been moved! In some cases it was done with so much malice that Grandfather wouldn't talk about it, but he laughed inwardly; I could see that, and it is possible he was up to some mischief. The poor inhabitants of the big town, especially those that were not familiar with it, were all mixed up figuring out who was who; they couldn't help it when they judged by the sign boards. Some people who thought they were coming to a sol emn meeting of the town elders, assembled to discuss highly important matters, found themselves instead in a school full of noisy boys just about to jump over their desks. There were even some people who mistook the church for the theater; and that was really awful! There has never been such a storm in our days; only Grandfather saw one, and that was when he was a very little boy. Such a storm may never come in our time, but it may in our grandchildren's, and then we must hope and pray that they will keep indoors while the storm shifts the signboards! Translated from the Danish by Jean Hersholt. Jean Hersholt.</page></plain_text>
