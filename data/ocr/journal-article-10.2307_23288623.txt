<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mormon Gender-Inclusive Image of God Danny L. Jorgensen In 1844 at Nauvoo, Joseph Smith Jr. introduced a radically inno vative concept of God—including the gender-inclusive image of God with which this paper deals. Before Nauvoo, he had inconsis tently presented various concepts and doctrines, all of which in volved positions similar to those found in early Christianity and those of his American contemporaries, many of whom also ques tioned what had become Christian "orthodoxy."1 His earliest (ca. DANNY L. JORGENSEN &lt;djorgens@hina.cas.usf.edu&gt;, professor and chair of religious studies at the University of South Florida, Tampa, presented an earlier version of this essay, "Gender-Inclusive Images of God: An Exploratory, Comparative Study of Shakerism and Mormonism," at the Mormon History Association annual meeting, 18 May 1996 at Snowbird, Utah. He appreciates the comments of Prisilla J. Brewer, Lawrence Foster, and the anonymous reviewers of the Journal of Mormon History on various drafts of this essay. 1 Secondary accounts of Mormonism's concept of God include: James Talmage, The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries, Ancient and Modern (Salt Lake City: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1912); Bruce R.

This position is strongly monotheistic with an overlay of trinitarianism, the orthodox Christian resolution to the perplexing problem of how the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost count as only one God. Since Smith did not treat this matter in formal philosophical or theo logical terms, his statements reflect a common-sense under standing of these qualities.2 His reports of his first vision, various revelations, and the scriptures he dictated all contain standard biblical imagery.3 "Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," he affirmed, "are one God, infinite and eternal, without end" (LDS D&amp;C 20:27).

The standard Mormon position is that they are one in purpose. • See Richard L. Bushman, Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1984); and Philip L. Barlow, Mormons and the Bible: The Place of the Latter-day Saints in American Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991).</page><page sequence="3">Danny i. Jorgensen/The Mormon Gender-Inclusive Image 97 The generally accepted reconciliation of trinitarianism with monotheism had not been universally accepted by early Chris tians (hence, the many "heresies" that accompanied the tri umph of Catholicism) nor was it universally accepted by Joseph Smith's contemporaries, such as Universalists like his grandfa ther, Asael Smith Sr., and his father, Joseph Smith Sr. Trinitari anism poses genuine perplexities, particularly the relationship of the Father and Son (such as: who is the God of the Old Testa ment? What names are they to be known by? etc.) Smith's 1844 teachings are clearly a rejection of classical theism and mono theism.4 In the last year of his life, however, the Mormon prophet began teaching a substantially different doctrine of God. Two sermons that Smith preached within months of his murder delineated a plurality of anthropomorphic gods, includ ing a possible feminine deity, along with other substantial devia tions from ordinary biblical images of God.5 4 See the inadequate recent discussion in Kurt Widmer, Mormonism and the Nature of God: A Theological Evolution, 1830-1915 (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarmand and Company, 2000); and Kent P. Jackson, "Are Mormons Christians? Presbyterians, Mormons, and the Question of Religious Definitions," Nova Religion: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions 4, no. 1 (October 2000): 52-65. Because Mormons do not subscribe to any ordinary (orthodox) trinitarianism, the position of most Baptism, Methodist, and Presbyterian groups—sometimes expressed in resolutions of national conventions, etc.—is that Mormons are not Christians. Conservative LDS thinkers like David Paulson have attempted to reinterpret the characteristics ascribed to God in classical theism (and in Joseph Smith's early position) as consistent with Smith's 1844 innovations and their subsequent development. The 1844 Smith sermons may be seen as preserving a monotheism of sorts in that the essence of everything is intelligence, perhaps comprising an unorthodox unity of the three-in-one godhead? 5 The King Follett funeral sermon that Smith preached on 7 April 1844 was published in the Times and Seasons 5 (15 August 1844): 612-17 and reprinted in the History of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, edited by B. H. Roberts, 7 vols., 2d ed. rev. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1976-1980), 6:302-17. On 16 June 1844, just before his death on 27 June, Smith delivered a sermon on "The Christian Godhead—Plurality of Gods," History of the Church, 6:473-79. See comprehensive commentary in Linda P.</page><page sequence="4">98 The Journal of Mormon History Inverting the traditional view of God as a spirit, Smith declared that God is a material being.6 He explained that the eternal ele ments—chiefly, spirit in the form of intelligence—were another, higher form of matter. This refined matter, which he called "intelli gence," is immortal and coeternal with God. It forms, he claimed, the essence of everything, including those beings who currently in habit human bodies and those premortal spirits that await human embodiment. Smith further maintained that God is an exalted man, that human beings may progress to god-like status or even become gods, and that there are a multiplicity of gods. Yet the biblical God is distinct, he explained, in having acquired a special knowledge of how to organize the eternal, universal elements. This Eternal Father thereby gained supremacy over other exalted celestial beings or gods. God the Eternal Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost composed the Godhead, according to Smith.7 Joseph Smith s new concept of God, like many of the novel doc trines that he introduced, probably circulated first within his elite, secretive inner circle ("Anointed Quorum") of intimate associates.8 Wilcox, "The Mormon Concept of a Mother in Heaven," in Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective, edited by Maureen Ursenbach Beecher and Lavina Fielding Anderson (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1987), 64-77. 6 See Thomas F. O'Dea, The Mormons (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1957), 120-33; and D&amp;C 93:33 and 131:7. Parley P. Pratt probably influenced Smith's metaphysics. "Matter as well as spirit," Pratt suggested, "is eternal, uncreated, self existing." Pratt, "Regeneration and Eternal Duration of Matter," Times and Seasons 2 (2 August 1841): 502; also History of the Church, 4:54 notes. 7 Joseph Smith preached: "I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and that the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit: and these three distinct personages and three Gods. If this is in accordance with the New Testament, lo and behold! we have three Gods anyhow, and they are plural: and who can contradict it? The oneness of the plurality of Gods is the oneness of the eternal mind or intelligence." History of the Church, 6:225.

Jorgensen/The Mormon Gender-Inclusive Image 99 None of the recorded contemporary statements attributed directly to him unequivocally confirm that he explicitly identified a "Mother in Heaven."9 Some members of the Anointed Quorum attributed this gender-inclusive idea to him and regarded the Heavenly Mother concept as a logical derivation of Smith's new God doctrine.10 Eliza R. Snow, one of Smith's plural wives, wrote a poem—later a famous hymn—that was published in the Nauvoo Times and Seasons shortly after Smith's death, also expressing the concept of a Heavenly Mother who was paired with the Heavenly Father.11 Little more is Mormon Temple Worship (San Francisco: Smith Research Associates, 1994), 35-68; and D. Michael Quinn, The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1994), esp. 105-85. 9 See, however, History of the Church, 5:254. In an editorial footnote, Joseph Smith (presumably) is quoted as saying: "Come to me; here's the mysteries man hath not seen, Here's our Father in heaven, and Mother, the Queen." Brigham Young's daughter Susa Young Gates, reported that Zina Diantha Huntington Jacobs Smith Young (a woman who was the plural wife of first Joseph Smith and, after his death, of Brigham Young) told her that Joseph Smith had consoled Zina for her mother's death in Nauvoo in 1839 by "telling her not only would she know her mother again on the other side but, 'more than that, you will meet and become acquainted with your eternal Mother, the wife of your Father in Heaven.'" Quoted in Wilcox, "The Mormon Concept of a Mother in Heaven," 65. 10 These individuals—Brigham Young, Parley and Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, and Erastus Snow—directly and indirectly acknowledged the Heavenly Mother. Wilcox, "The Mormon Concept of a Mother in Heaven," 65-67. The Church-controlled Times and Seasons 6 (1 May 1845): 892, published a letter to the editor by "Joseph's Speckled Bird" in which the author described a previous existence in which "the spiritual body... was a child with his father and mother in heaven" but then received "a temporal body" that resembled the spirit body, into which God put "the life of his spiritual body . . . and gave him the power of endless lives." This is a succinct but still-accurate description of what Mormons today believe about the premortal existence and mortality.

Because the concept of a Mother in Heaven is enig matic, scholars have concentrated on accounting for the conse quences of a female deity for women or have endeavored to elabo rate this image theologically.13 Little or no work has been done on Mormon Concept of a Mother in Heaven," 65, reports that LDS President Wilford Woodruff credited Eliza Snow as having had this revelation directly but that his second successor, Joseph F. Smith, assigned the revelation to Joseph Smith: "God revealed that principle that we have a mother as well as a father in heaven to Joseph Smith; Joseph Smith revealed it to Eliza Snow Smith, his wife; and Eliza Snow was inspired, being a poet, to put it into verse." 12 According to Wilcox, "The Mormon Concept of a Mother in Heaven," 64, this idea "is a shadowy and elusive one floating around the edges of Mormon consciousness." While it was taken for granted by nineteenth-century Mormon leaders (65-66), many of whom were contemporaries of Joseph Smith, the existence of a Mother in Heaven was not formally acknowledged until 1909 (68-69) in the First Presidency (Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, Anthon H. Lund) doctrinal statement, "The Origin of Man," Improvement Era (November 1909): 80. Most recently, Gordon B. Hinckley, acting as First Counselor in the First Presidency, speaking first in a conference of Regional Representatives and next at a Churchwide broadcast to LDS women, announced that it was "inappropriate for anyone in the Church to pray to our Mother in Heaven" because it did not follow the instructions of Christ about prayer and because no "President of the church . . . has offered a prayer" to the Mother. He concluded: "None of us can add to or diminish that glory of her of whom we have no revealed knowledge" (5 April and 28 September 1991, printed as "Daughters of God," Ensign, Nov. 1991, 97-100). 13 This comment is not intended to disparage these invaluable descriptive contributions in any way for their failure to focus on the Mother in Heaven theology.

This paper suggests a possible origin for Mormonism's gender inclusive image of God and delineates some of this concept's para doxical consequences for IDS gender relationships and gender in stitutions.' 1 I see the concept of a feminine deity as intrinsic to Joseph Smith's innovative reconceptualization of God as gender-in clusive—the very capstone of Mormonism's salvation theology and its central appeal. Alternatives to the orthodox biblical image of an exclusively male God are uniquely interesting, especially for sociological studies of gender definitions, roles, relationships, and institutions. 5 There theological essays. 14 Gender institutions are a subset of social institutions, or thoughts and actions that have become regularized to the point that they serve as the basis for a given social order. Peter L. Berger, The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion (New York: Doubleday, 1967), identifies a three-phase process by which social institutions are created: (1) externalization, or the social construction of meaning attached to certain objects or events, (2) objectification, or the treatment of these externalized meanings as if they were facts of reality, even though they were humanly constructed, and (3) internalization, or individuals' reappropriation of these externalized and objectified meanings. (This last step is sometimes called socialization.) Social institutions define correct conduct, desirable goals, group norms, social status, and expected roles. For example, the categories of "female" and "male" are human universals; but what it means to be a woman or what it means to be a man varies dramatically among different cultures. Thus, gender is a social construction. I use the concept of gender institutions to identify social conventions that define (create or recreate meanings) and enact what it means to be "female" and "male" in the context of a particular culture/society. It is a more comprehensive concept than gender roles, since it refers to all the ways in which the meanings and activities of being female or male have been institutionalized, not just the performance of certain activities (roles) associated with them. The social institution we identify as Victorianism, for instance, included a particular gender institution that, in turn, dictated gender roles. 15 See Mary Farrell Bednarowski, "Outside the Mainstream: Women's Religion and Women Religious Leaders in Nineteenth-Century</page><page sequence="8">102 The Journal of Mormon History fore, in the material that follows, it is important to remember that social theories of religion do not and cannot verify or refute God concepts or doctrines.16 Symbolic images of God are extremely in formative, however, as basic paradigms for human existence.17 Theories of religion can and do trace the social origin of supernatu ral imagery and the social consequences of these symbols as a sepa rate activity from refuting, exhaustively explaining, or ultimately judging the ontological status of these beliefs.18 The Heavenly Mother Enigma Mormomsm s Heavenly Mother is an extremely interesting and complex concept because it seems to be totally incongruent with America,"Journal of the American Academy of Religion 48, no. 2 (1980): 207-31; and her New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1989), 19-44, for a critique of classical theism and a defense of alternative images. 1('The sociology of knowledge perspective developed here is not concerned with philosophical or theological debates about God.

If "reductionism" is understood as an effort to explain supernaturalism by grounds other than religion and its claims about reality, then this is true. Yet most scholarly accounts of religion, particularly those indebted to the social sciences, inevitably are reductionistic in this sense. Social theories of religion simply do not provide any epistemological basis for sustaining or refuting supernaturalism; and they necessarily are, therefore, epistemologically agnostic.</page><page sequence="9">Danny L. Jorgensen/the Mormon Gender-Inclusive Image 103 what scholars usually assume is a highly patriarchal religion. Gender inclusive images of God are expected to result in more positive ap praisals of women and greater gender equality (as discussed below). Yet Mormonism appears to contradict these expectations. None of the considerable research on Latter-day Saint women supports the conclusion that they have become equal to men or that Mormon pa triarchy has been moderated by the Mother in Heaven image.19 In fact, many observers think that Mormon women have perplexingly become more circumscribed—not less—by predominantly patriar 20 chai institutions over time. Lawrence Foster, for instance, points out: "Mormon women in frontier Utah enjoyed a remarkable degree of real power, influence, and independence. . . . Nearly a hundred 19 See Claudia L.

Mary Bednarowski, theologian and scholar of new religions at United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities, New Brighton, Minnesota, has explored alternative images of God and their influence on gen der roles in new American religions. She suggests that women are more likely to achieve leadership and greater equality with men when concepts of a masculine God are modified by bisexual imagery or by images of God as nonpersonal and nonanthropomorphic, when the doctrine of the Fall is limited by denials or temperings, when the ecclesiastical structure does not ordain clergy, and when social roles for women do not exclusively define their fulfillment by marriage and motherhood.22 Mormonism, Bednarowski noted in related studies, rejected original sin; but it did not develop the Mother in Heaven concept; it limited priesthood to men; it defined a woman's status as contingent on and complementary to a domi nant male (typically a husband); and it identified motherhood as a woman's highest status (parallel to male priesthood)."3 Despite a gencler-inclusive image of Heavenly Parents, she argues, all of these other factors account for the subordination of Mormon women. Rosemary Radford Reuther, a philosopher of religion, also dis cussed the Latter-day Saints in two surveys of women in alternative religions but exhibited little interest in the Heavenly Mother belief.24 21 Lawrence Foster, Women, Family, and Utopia: Communal Experiments of the Shakers, the Oneida Community, and the Mormons (New York: Syracuse University Press, 1991), 202-3. 22 Bednarowski, "Outside the Mainstream," 207-31. 23 Bednarowski, "Widening the Banks of the Mainstream: Women Constructing Theologies," in Women's Leadership in Marginal Religions: Explorations Outside the Mainstream, edited by Catherine Wessinger (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1993); and Bednarowski, New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America, 21-27. 24 Rosemary Radford Ruether, "Women in Utopian Movements," in Wovien and Religion in America.

Jorgensen/The Mormon Gender-Inclusive Image 105 Instead, Reuther focused on plural marriage (polygamy or, more correctly, polygyny) as an obvious manifestation of Mormon patri archy. Other scholars, however, have interpreted Latter-day Saint polygyny quite differently. Religion scholar Barbara Zikmund of fered Mormonism's Mother in Heaven as an excellent example of a feminist concept in nineteenth-century American sectarianism.2d She suggested, furthermore, that plural marriage may have "fulfilled certain feminist goals." Other scholars have likewise argued that plural marriage contributed to a unique form of female solidarity in which Mormon women achieved considerable autonomy and inde pendence.26 As this overview shows, Mormonism has a gender-inclusive God concept; and early Mormon women had some power, influence, and freedom. However, the Mother in Heaven idea has not been elabo rated doctrinally, and Mormon gender roles have become more, rather than less, patriarchal. In concentrating on the goddess-patri archy puzzle, the feminist studies reviewed above simply skipped over the apparent anomaly of early Mormon women's roles. These inquiries, furthermore, have not addressed adequately the critically important question of the Mother in Heaven's origin.

Catherine Albanese, a professor of religious studies at UC-Santa Barbara, addressed the origin question by suggesting that Mormon ism s gender-inclusive God is a form of active mysticism. She argued that, because religious mysticism manifests itself as highly personal, even unique, experience, to the extent that Mormons ex perienced the Heavenly Mother mystically or symbolically, a collec tive expression simply may not exist. Albanese's hypothesis merits investigation; but the idea that the Heavenly Mother is experienced mystically (and hence individually), even in some "active" form, seems to contradict other facets of Mormonism's overwhelmingly social expressions, particularly its political kingdom building, con struction of communities, and restructuring of elementary human institutions like marriage and family. Albanese's account therefore does not resolve the Heavenly Mother enigma. 97 The most systematic interpretation of the Heavenly Mother s ori gin is a sociological study by professors of religion John Heeren, Donald B. Lindsey, and Marylee Mason.28 They base their analysis on Emile Durkheim's acclaimed theory of religion, particularly his central insight that religious concepts originate in and mirror under lying social relationships.29 The Heavenly Mother's origin, they ar gued, is best explained as part of Mormonism's anthropomorphic view of God. Mother in Heaven is properly seen as elevating the conjugal relationship into the eternal realm. This deification of the family allows for spiritual birth, which essentially corresponds to the reproductive process among mortals. The original expressions of 27 Catherine L. Albanese, "Mormonism and the Male-Female God: An Exploration in Active Mysticism," Sunstone 6, no. 2 (March-April 1981): 52-58. 28John Heeren, Donald B. Lindsey, and Marylee Mason, "The Mormon Concept of Mother in Heaven: A Sociological Account of Its Origins and Development, "Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 23, no. 4 (1984): 396-411. They also find the explanation of mysticism incompatible with Mormonism's social success. 29 Emile Dürkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, translated by Joseph Ward Swain (New York: Free Press, 1915); also see Emile Dürkheim and Marcel Mauss, Primitive Classification, translated by Rodney Needham (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963).</page><page sequence="13">Danny L. Jorgensen/the Mormon Gender-Inclusive Image 107 the Mother in Heaven belief provided divine sanction, not for equal ity, but for patriarchal (and plural) marriage.30 Heeren, Lindsey, and Mason resolve the paradox, then, by the "ironic" conclusion that "patriarchy and belief in a goddess go hand-in-hand."31 This conclusion, however, is more than merely ironic: It con tradicts the fundamental premise of Durkheim's theory. Properly understood, Durkheim's theory holds that the Heavenly Mother originated with changes in Mormon social relationships allowing women as well as men to become gods. Heeren, Lindsey, and Mason thus failed to seriously consider the potential for greater equality in early Mormon gender relationships.Their conclusion, moreover, does not explain why the Mother in Heaven innovation was in any way necessary. A goddess certainly was not needed to justify polygyny. The traditional belief in an exclusively male God, along with traditional readings of Eve's creation and sin from Genesis, furnish a much more potent legitimation of polygyny, as is abundantly evident in other biblical religions past and present. Elevating woman to divine status creates enormous problems pre cisely because of all of the ways in which the Bible legitimates the inferiority of women, validates polygynous families, and exalts pa triarchal authority.33 Even so, Durkheim's theory, especially as it has been developed by Mary Douglas and Peter Berger, provides an invaluable perspec tive for addressing the social origin and consequences of Mormon 30 Dürkheim, The Elementary Forms, 403. 31 Ibid., 409. 32 Their discussion of Mother in Heaven and gender roles was marred by their lack of historical awareness; they essentially read present conditions back into Nauvoo. Early Mormon gender roles must be interpreted according to 1840s culture—not according to the substantially different gender values of our day. 33 Not surprisingly, this same characteristic is exactly the most controversial point about the underdeveloped image of the Heavenly Mother for Mormonism today. See, for example, Wilcox, "The Mormon Concept of a Mother in Heaven," 71-74; Hanks, "Introduction," in Women and Authority, xxv-xxvii; Sonja Farnsworth, "Mormonism's Odd Couple: The Motherhood-Priesthood Connection," ibid., 299-314; and Margaret Merrill Toscano, '"Put On Your Strength, O Daughters of Zion': Claiming Priesthood and Knowing the Mother," ibid., 411-37.</page><page sequence="14">108 The Journal of Mormon History ism's gender-inclusive God concept. The Durkheimian theory un equivocally maintains that sociocultural realities are sui generis (true or real on their own grounds and irreducible to more elementary levels of analysis, such as individuals or their psychology or biology). It does not dismiss religion as an opiate or illusion. Instead, the theory holds that socially constructed realities, such as religion, have very real consequences for believers. Thus, unlike Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, Durkheim's theory does not explain religion away as a mere human externalization or projection. Mary Douglas, a British social anthropologist, carries Durkheim's theory a step fur ther by seeing mental images of God and gender as social institu tions.34 She maintains that social institutions "think" by coherently ordering, circumscribing, and directing human experience, thought, and action. In other words, beliefs about God and beliefs about the proper roles for men and women meaningfully order and arrange what and how members of a society feel, think, and act. Social insti tutions admittedly are idealized models and individual conformity to them always is variable. Nevertheless, institutions proscribe and prohibit some actions rather than others (monogamy rather than polygyny). An individual is labeled as deviant when he or she fails to conform with those expectations. Peter Berger continued the dialogue by identifying the Durkhe imian emphasis on collective representations (symbols) as an exten sion (projection) of social organizational arrangements; the "dialec tical process" that constitutes society consists of a succession of such moments.35 These externalized symbols, he pointed out, are "objec tivated" (collectively defined and enacted as something other than the products of human activity), and "internalized" (reappropriated into the consciousness of individuals over successive generations). In sociological terms, then, Mormon society found a way to "think" about gender by externalizing such concepts as a new understanding about the nature of God. In turn, the social consequences of this new image were new reenactments of gender relationships among men and women which, in turn, led to additional thinking about a Heavenly Father and a Heavenly Mother.

Social Origin of the Mother in Heaven Concept If this Durkheimian hypothesis is valid, then there should be some historical evidence that Joseph Smith's gender-inclusive image of God can be found in the social context of early Mormonism. Revo lutionary changes in the American way of organizing gender rela tionships were occurring in the early nineteenth century. In general, the colonial period's view of human nature, and especially of women, was an extremely negative interpretation of the narrative in Genesis 2.3t&gt; According to this interpretation, God created the woman (Eve) from the man (Adam) for his benefit. Her weak and sinful nature resulted in humanity's fallen condition. God cursed all women because of Eve's sin, leaving all women inferior to men in all ways (biologically, psychologically, intellectually, socially, and morally). Women were sexually and morally dangerous to society, unless they were firmly under the control and direction of men. Although men also had sinned in the Fall, they were still purer and less sinful than women.37 36 See Elaine H. Pagels, "What Became of God the Mother?

Because women were believed to be weak, inferior, and dangerous, they were excluded from all public matters. "Proper" behavior for women was silence, diligence in per forming their assigned duties, unquestioning obedience to their fa thers (if unmarried) and husbands (if married), and continual piety. In actual fact, of course, gender role differentiation was less rigid in domestic life, partly because of the agrarian economy and frontier existence. Men principally were expected to sustain the family's live lihood, while women primarily were responsible for food and cloth ing preparation. Yet couples often worked together at home—typi cally at farming and/or cottage-based businesses, crafts, trades or industries—sharing in these labors as well as caring for and training their children.58 American culture and society underwent monumental changes, however, from about 1680 to around 1820.39 Contributing to these colonies. The social elites in the North and especially the southern colonies created and conformed to somewhat different gender norms. 38 Men had the legal right to compel obedience from their wives by physical beatings, as long as the punishment was not considered excessive. Single women (not directly subject to male authority) were the most likely to be accused of witchcraft; such trials can be seen as a social exertion of patriarchal authority. Women who refused to conform to these gender-role definitions, especially the expectation that they would remain silent in public, commonly were sanctioned severely, as in the case of Anne Hutchinson. See, for instance, John P. Demos, Entertaining Satan: Witchcraft and the Culture of Early New England (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982); Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, Salem Possessed: The Social Origins of Witchcraft (Cambridge, Mass.: Oxford University Press, 1974); Emery Battis, Satans and Sectaries: Anne Hutchinson and the Antinomian Controversy in the Massachusetts Bay Colony (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1962); Lyle Koehler, Search for Power: The "Weaker Sex" in Seventeenth-Century New England (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1980). 39 See Alice Felt Tyler, Freedom's Ferment: Phases of American Social History from the Colonial Period to the Outbreak of the Civil War (New York: Harper and Row, 1962); Whitney R.

Humanity was envisioned more optimistically—as less sinful and depraved. The idea that individuals were responsible for their own salvation gradually moderated the harsh Calvinistic doctrine of election. Even more sweepingly over time, the biblical view of women as weak and morally inferior gave way to the Victo rian idealization of women as pure and innocent—the guardians of virtue. Stimulated by American modernization, the new Victorian views of gender resulted in substantially different roles and relationships.11 John Butler, Awash in a Sea of Faith: Christianizing the American People (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990); R.

Women, though still circumscribed to the private sphere as in earlier times, were no longer seen as weak and sinful creatures who needed to be kept under stern discipline by religion, family, and home. Rather, because women were seen as purer and more virtuous, they were responsible for guarding and enforcing the Christian morality of their homes and male kinfolk. They, to a greater extent than men, populated the churches.42 Vol untary associations of women, many of them religion based, organ ized to combat evils like slavery and vices like alcoholism, prostitu tion, and gambling. Even political participation could be justified as a kind of moral housekeeping.43 Women, particularly in new and sectarian religions, began to perform other significant roles, includ ing leadership. Yet in spite of fresh opportunities and the democratic ethos of greater egalitarianism, women's roles were increasingly re stricted otherwise to the private sphere. The dominant status of women was domestic and epitomized by motherhood. The early Mormons substantially reflected, embraced, and imple mented these emergent Victorian gender institutions, although they adapted these values and norms according to their circumstances and religious ideology.44 For example, even though Joseph Smith 12 Butler, Awash in a Sea of Faith, 281-85; Welter, "The Feminization of American Religion," 137-57; and Zikmund, "The Feminist Thrust of Sectarian Christianity," 207-9. 43 See Keith Melder, "Ladies Bountiful: Organized Female Benevolence in Early Nineteenth-Century America," New York History 48 (July 1967): 235-38; Nancy F.

Jorgensen/The Mormon Gender-Inclusive Image 113 initially taught a conventional biblical concept of God, he thoroughly rejected the doctrine of original sin and the related descriptions of women as inherently weak and sinful. Instead, the earliest LDS scrip tures strongly advocated a doctrine of free will (or agency) (Mosiah 18:28; 2 Ne. 10:23; D&amp;C 29:35-7,58:27,124:69,134:2). Furthermore, the Fall, in Mormonism, was actually a foreordained blessing. In Joseph Smith's revision of Genesis (4:11), Eve says: "Were it not for our transgressions, we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto the obedient." It is true that Mormon women were excluded from leadership roles and priest hood offices; however, they were responsible for their own salvation and actively participated in selected religious activities.45 They were not forbidden to preach or pray; and they voted with men on deci sions placed before the membership. Early Mormon women also exercised the gifts of the Spirit: wisdom, healing, miracles, prophecy, discerning spirits, speaking in tongues, and the interpretation of tongues.46 Patriarchal blessings of early LDS women frequently pro Protestants like Methodists and Baptists. Other studies that generally support these contentions include Leonard J. Arl ington, "The Economic Role of Pioneer Mormon Women," Western Humanities Review 9 (Spring 1955): 145-64; Arrington, "Blessed Damozels: Women in Mormon History," Dialogue 6 (Summer 1971): 21-31; Arrington, "Persons for All Seasons: Women in Mormon History," BYU Studies 20 (Fall 1979): 39-58; Maureen Ursenbach Beecher, "Women's Work on the Mormon Frontier," Utah Historical Quarterly 49 (Summer 1981): 276-90; and Vella Neil Evans, "Mormon Women and the Right to Wage Work," Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 23 (Winter 1990): 45-61. However, Wilcox, in "Mormon Motherhood: Official Images," 208-26, argued that Victorian gender images and roles did not reach Utah until the turn of the century because "the frontier societies of Missouri, Nauvoo, and the Great Basin had little room for the Victorian image of the pure, gentle, ever-patient mother" (209). 1 basically agree with this assessment but would add that Wilcox does not develop a comparative perspective on gender roles and, although motherhood came to epitomize Victorian images of gender, it also subsumed a variety of women's roles. 45 Raynes, "Mormon Marriages in an American Context," 229. 46 Linda King Newell, "Gifts of the Spirit: Women's Share," in Sisters in Spirit, 111-50; Newell, "A Gift Given, A Gift Taken: Washing, Anointing,</page><page sequence="20">114 The Journal of Mormon History claimed their special talents and callings, although their social iden tities often were defined as contingent on a husband and/or fa ther.47 Mormons took it for granted that marriage was the norm for men and women, with the family envisioned as the basic unit of society. Typically, Mormons lived in settlements on the frontier, engaged in agricultural and nonindustrial crafts, trades, and small shop-based businesses. As in the larger Victorian society, men were defined as the family's economic provider and political leader in all matters, public and private. Women were expected to defer to male authority and to fulfill their own roles (primarily those of wife and mother) within the private sphere. However, these socioeconomic conditions meant that gender roles were less rigidly segregated than under more urban-industrial conditions—as, for example, in northern factory towns. Fathers were more accessible to their children, and families tended to work to gether on projects. Furthermore, Mormon women sometimes per formed work that more customarily was done by men when dictated by frontier agrarian conditions or while the men were away from home on religious missions. Women also took employment at times.48 Married women sometimes earned income at home by tak and Blessing the Sick Among Mormon Women," Sunstone 6 (Sept ember/October 1981): 16-25; and Claudia Lauper Bushman, "Mystics and Healers," Mormon Sisters, 1-23.

In short, the early Mormons essentially participated in the larger social change from Genesis-based gender roles to Victorian ones, adapting these ideals as required by their circumstances. The over riding goal for all of its members in this new American religion was to realize the Kingdom of God on earth, and women as well as men were expected to make substantial contributions to this ultimate goal. Thomas O'Dea's assertion that "Mormonism early came very close to accepting the equality of women and men," may be too generous;49 however, the social status of women had greatly im proved by the early 1840s from what it had been in previous genera tions. This, then, was the social context in which the concept of a Heav enly Mother emerged in Mormonism. I summarize the salient fea tures of this concept as follows: The Mother God was not completely equal to the Father God. Instead, everything known about the con cept of the Heavenly Mother reflected and legitimated the roles performed by early Mormon women. She was the spouse of God the Father and the mother of his spirit children. However, this Eternal Mother was also a deity. Although subordinate to the Heavenly Fa ther's supreme authority, she had authority over her domain, par ticularly her offspring. This description thus supports the Durkhe imian hypothesis, suggesting that the concept of a gender-inclusive God simultaneously grew out of and was reinforced by the social context of beliefs about proper gender roles.50 women go out to work; this is a fact, and not only women, but men, too; for in the Church of Christ, all that are able have to work to fulfill the commandments of the Lord; and the situation in which many have come up here, has brought them under the necessity of seeking employment. . . [yet] they have been honorably compensated." History of the Church, 1:380. 49 O'Dea, The Mormons, 249. 50 [i)¡s explanation of the Heavenly Mother leaves open the possibility of other influences and contributing factors. Mormonism's gender-inclusive God concept, as Albanese speculated, does resemble certain Gnostic images and basic Hermetic principles. D.

Granted, their frontier existence and preoccupation with building the Kingdom of God moderated their otherwise largely Victorian gender institutions. Gender inequality in religious matters primarily derived trom women s exclusion from the priesthood. In the early 1840s, however, Mormon leaders began practicing polygyny, an exceptionally patriarchal form of marriage and family. Priesthood and polygyny provide the most damaging evidence against the scholarly anticipation that the Heavenly Mother concept socially and religiously empowered early Mormon women. Joseph Smith created the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo in 1842.51 This charitable association provided a publicly recognized way for women to collectively perform meaningful roles other than those of wives and mothers. Although it functioned under priest hood direction and supervision (Joseph Smith and his male associ ates frequently addressed its meetings), the Relief Society was a semi autonomous organization with offices parallel to priesthood offices. Through this organization, Mormon women assisted the poor, vig orously investigated and defended the members' virtuous reputa tions and community morality, and provided spiritual and social support and blessing. The Female Relief Society consequently 1987) also discusses hermetic influences on Mormonism as do Lance Owens, "Joseph Smith and Kabbalah: The Occult Connection," Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 27 (Fall 1994): 117-96; Max Nolan, "Joseph Smith and Mysticism, "Journal of Mormon History 10 (1983): 105-16; and John L.

Jorgensen/The Mormon Gender-Inclusive Image 117 bridged the Victorian gender gap between private and public spheres. Familiar with other religiously based female reform and benevolent societies, Mormon women deliberately planned their association as more expansive in vision than these other Victorian organizations. At least some Relief Society members believed that the Mormon prophet promised or actually extended priesthood to them.53 Such a belief was notjust wishful thinking. Smith's organizational remarks assured the women that "the Society should move according to the ancient Priesthood," and its members would become "a kingdom of priests as in Enoch's day—as in Paul's day."51 Emma Smith, Joseph's wife, was the first president; its other leaders were also Anointed Quorum members. Smith began initiating his closest male friends to this secret quoium in 1842 but it was not organized fully until their wives were included in 1843. Through a preliminary temple "endowment," husbands and wives entered into a covenant with God whereby they were "anointed" to be "kings and priests" and "queens and priestesses" respectively. He subsequently introduced them to the temple rites of eternal marriage and a "second anoint ing" (or "fulness of the priesthood"). Eternal marriage "sealed" the partners together forever, while the male priesthood holder and his wife or wives were "ordained 'King and Queen, Priest and Priestess to the Most high God for Time and through out all Eternity'" during the second anointing rite.55 The Anointed women later instructed other Mormon women as they received these ordinances and also performed other priesthood-related functions.56 Because Smith was murdered shortly after these events, it is dif ficult to know exactly what he intended and impossible to guess the 52 Derr, '"Strength in Our Union,'" 159. 53 See D. Michael Quinn, "Mormon Women Have Had the Priesthood Since 1843," in Women and Authority, edited by Hanks, 365-409; Newell, "The Historical Relationship of Mormon Women and Priesthood," 112-16; and Barber, "The Ecclesiastical Position of Women in Two Mormon Trajectories." 54 Minutes of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo, 30 March 1842 and 29 April 1842, quoted in Quinn, "Mormon Women Have Had," 365. 55 Ibid., 365-66, 368. 56 Ibid., 365-72; Newell, "The Historical Relationship of Mormon Women and Priesthood," 111-20.</page><page sequence="24">118 The Journal of Mormon History full extent of his experiments with gender relations. The evidence, however, strongly supports the contention that Joseph Smith ex tended the priesthood or something very like it to early Mormon women. Although no particular office was specified and although there was no an ordinance comparable to the laying on of hands by which men were ordained to priesthood office, they clearly acquired some kind of special authoritative status through the temple endow ment. That women received this "priesthood" independently from men was reinforced by the responsibility of women for their own salvation and the later endowment of unmarried women. The devel opment of a female form of priesthood, viewed from a Durkheimian standpoint, logically and coherently follows from the concept of God as gender inclusive. The fulfillment of the expectation predicted by this sociological expectation provides a different kind of support from the historical (empirical) evidence advanced by other scholars that Mormon women in Nauvoo were in fact endowed with priest hood authority or its equivalent. Nevertheless, this logical extension of the Heavenly Mother concept to include female priesthood was not institutionalized duringjoseph Smith's life. Polygamy provides the strongest challenge to the expectation that the Mormon concept of God as gender inclusive would influence more equitable gender relationships.5 Plural marriage manifestly did support and reinforce patriarchy. However, plural marriage never was required, a majority of Mormons never participated in it (except perhaps in a few communities), and it was eventually aban doned. While higher-ranking ecclesiastical officers, especially the First Presidency and Twelve, generally had the greatest number of wives, it does not seem true that a few men controlled the distribu tion of marriageable women.58 The revelation on plural marriage promised women greater celestial glory in exchange for consenting 5 See Jessie L. Embry, Mormon Polygamous Families: Life in the Principle (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1987); Foster, Religion and, Sexuality; Linda King Newell and Valeen Tippetts Avery, Mormon Enigma: Emma Hale Smith: Prophet's Wife, "Elect Lady, " Polygamy's Foe (New York: Doubleday, 1984); and Richard S. Van Wagoner, Mormon Polygamy: A History (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1986). 58 Ruether, "Women in Utopian Movements," 49, argues that Mormon polygyny was "originally the privilege of the leadership"—but this description misstates the Mormon situation.</page><page sequence="25">Danny L. Jorgensen/The Mormon Gender-Inclusive Image 119 to the practice, and anecdotal evidence agrees that at least some (and perhaps most) of the women were motivated by otherworldly prom ises for them and their families. However, this dynamic does not unequivocally support the conclusion of Heeren, Lindsey, and Ma son that belief in a Mother God ironically reinforced patriarchy.59 In fact, I am unaware of any documentation linking Mother in Heaven with arguments for polygamy, either theologically or socio logically, on the part of participants. Because men also benefited celestially from polygamy, it is equally true that their exaltation was equally dependent on women. There is also sound evidence that plural marriage provided freedom from Victorian gender obliga tions for at least some Mormon plural wives. Outsiders typically found plural marriage objectionable on the grounds that it oppressed and debased women.'10 Yet the Saints women included—defended this highly patriarchal practice on pre cisely opposite grounds.'1' They argued that polygamy honorably provided the opportunity of marriage and children to women who might otherwise remain single and that it was a positive solution to many of the social evils deriving from the conventional American practice of monogamy such as seduction, fornication, abortion, in fanticide, adultery, and prostitution. Mormon men were supposed to receive permission from an ecclesiastical superior before taking a second wife and, at least technically, were to demonstrate that they were religiously and economically prepared for this added respon sibility.6" They were also supposed to seek the permission of the first wife. In fact, the practice was never as well regulated as the theory called for; but a plural wife was permitted to divorce her husband 59 Heeren, Lindsey, and Mason, "The Mormon Concept of Mother in Heaven," 409. &lt;)0 See Arrington and Bitton, The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints (New York: Knopf, 1979), 187-239; Foster, Women, Family, and Utopia, 182-201; and Derr, '"Strength in Our Union.'" 61 See Embry, Mormon Polygamous Families, 41-7; Foster, Women, Family, and Utopia, 191-96; B.

Older women could find social and economic security in a supportive family. Barren wives could participate in motherhood by helping raise the children of their sister wives. To the extent that plural wives found meeting the sexual needs of their husbands a Victorian obligation, they could share it with other wives. Multiple wives provided Mormon women with options for dividing up house hold and economic responsibilities, perhaps to the greater satisfac tion of some or all. In many instances, plural marriage resulted in tremendous solidarity among sister wives. At its best, this Mormon sorority uniquely provided adult friends and support, particularly when the husband was working for long hours, serving a mission, or otherwise away from the home for extended periods. While men and women were not equal, especially in authority and power, Mormonism did not position women as inherently inferior to men. Difference, in other words, did not necessarily involve the application of differential, hierarchical values to gender images and roles. Women's roles (motherhood) were different from men's roles (priesthood and fatherhood), but not fundamentally more or less glorious. The salvation of men and women was mutually interde pendent. Mormon culture endeavored to balance male authority with corresponding responsibilities—social and economic obliga tions for the welfare of women and children—without acknow ledging inequality, thereby seeking to avoid the potentially abusive power of patriarchy and tyranny. There are other suggestions that the concept of a Heavenly Mother subsequently resulted in expanded gender roles for Mor mon women.65 The Utah Saints pushed for extending the secular vote to women ahead of the rest of the nation.66 While these efforts 63 Ibid., 175-79; Foster, Women, Family, and Utopia, 196-98; and Foster, "A Little-Known Defense of Polygamy from the Mormon Press in 1842," Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 9 (Winter 1974): 21-34. 64 See Derr, '"Strengthening Our Union,"' 163-68. 65 Foster, Women, Family, and Utopia, 193-95. 66 See Thomas G.

Mormon women were among the first of their gender to be elected to local offices, including legislative, in any of the states. Utah Mormon women were encouraged to acquire formal educa tion, even in law and medicine, from which American women gen erally were excluded by Victorian conventions.67 Utah colleges, fur thermore, enrolled significant proportions of women; and by the turn of the twentieth century, impressive numbers of Mormon women were involved in professional careers.68 It is possible to argue that, ironically, Mormon gender institutions became more patriar chal after plural marriage was abandoned.

Nor is it possible to provide definitive answers about why and how Mormon women have become even more subordinate to male authority during the twentieth century. A portion of this problem, however, is like that oí explaining the institutionalization ot other doctrines introduced by the founding Mormon prophet. Max We ber's famous discussion of the routinization of charisma and the related distinction between prophetic and priestly roles describes Joseph Smith and Brigham Young with general accuracy.69 A simple answer, then, is that Brigham Young and his successors selectively understood and interpreted Joseph Smith's teachings and applied them to substantially different circumstances. Acting in a priestly mode, Young and subsequent LDS leaders primarily were con cerned with securing, not innovatively expanding, what Smith had created prophetically. Brigham Young demonstrated little interest in elaborating Smith's gender-inclusive concept of God or other teachings so long as they worked and remained unproblematic. He found no social or religious reason to develop the Heavenly Mother concept as Nauvoo Mormonism was transplanted and implemented in the West. It therefore remained undeveloped but part of the Saints's conscious ness. Similarly, female priesthood remained dormant, partly be cause Young and his contemporaries generally were opposed to the idea, and later social changes reinforced the view of priesthood as inherently male. As Utah Mormonism adapted to these sociocultural developments, this religion and the social relations it encouraged also were transformed significantly. Mormonism was, from the beginning, a revolutionary reaction to the modernization of American society.70 The intermountain West insulated Utah Mormonism from modernity until after the Civil War and, even then, it adapted only gradually to the American main stream and only under ferocious federal pressure.71 By the turn of 69 Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion, translated by Ephraim Fischoff (1922; Boston: Beacon Press, 1963), 46-59. 70 See Hill, Quest for Refuge. 71 See O'Dea, The Mormons, 222-57; Arrington and Bitton, The Mormon Experience, 161-84; and Allen and Leonard, The Story of the Latter-day Saints, 383-440.</page><page sequence="29">Danny L.

Gender roles also shifted, becoming more distinctively Victorian. Whereas Mormon women in Utah during the last half of the nineteenth century had considerable power, influence, and autonomy, the next half century saw an increasing constriction to the private sphere and emphasis on their status as wives and moth ers. 2 Summary and Conclusion Previous scholarly efforts to account for Mormonism s doctrinal and sociological concept of a Heavenly Mother have concentrated on the apparent contradiction between a predominantly patriarchal religion and a gender-inclusive concept of God. Efforts to explain this goddess-patriarchy puzzle have faced an additional dilemma— the anomaly of early Mormonism's more egalitarian gender roles and relationships. A Durkheimian perspective on Mormonism's con cept of a gender-inclusive God explains the social origins of the Mother in Heaven image and also illuminates the paradoxes that have perplexed other scholars. Early Mormons followed larger cultural trends in replacing the Genesis image of woman as weak, inferior, and dangerous with the Victorian image of women as pure, innocent, and virtuous. Joseph Smith's charismatically introduced innovation of a gender-inclusive image of God was an extension and deification of this gender insti tution as it had been adapted to the Saints's existence on the Ameri can frontier and this emergent new religion. The Heavenly Mother image also had liberating consequences for early Mormon gender roles and institutions. The women had considerable influence, 72 Foster, Women, Family, and Utopia, 209-19, emphasized the end of the frontier, the accommodation to American culture, the development of uniform Church programs, and the fear of liberal contamination as the factors driving these changes in Mormon gender roles and relationships. There are, of course, exceptions to this generalization, most notably the Relief Society's experiment in the 1920s with professionalizing its charity as social work. Although successful, the available resources were swamped by the needs of the Great Depression.</page><page sequence="30">124 The Journal of Mormon History power, and autonomy in religion and daily life—a marked contrast to the gender institutions of previous generations of Americans and many of their female contemporaries. Early Mormon women even performed some of the functions subsequently restricted to the ex clusively male priesthood. Joseph Smith's violent death, however, abbreviated whatever elaboration of the Heavenly Mother concept and its implications for expanded roles for women that he may have had in mind. During the late nineteenth century, modernity and the more restrictive implications of Victorian gender institutions even tually overwhelmed Utah Mormonism. Today, Mormon gender roles can be characterized as neo-Victorian and highly patriarchal, especially in comparison with the pluralistic gender images, radical democracy, and egalitarian ethos of many American gender institu tions. Although Mormonism s ingenious, gender-inclusive concept of God has not been elaborated, the Heavenly Mother idea exists doc trinally and it is a part of the Saints's collective consciousness, if only as an "elusive and shadowy" image. The Mother in Heaven idea is, furthermore, indispensably connected to Mormon ideals of restora tionism, dispensationalism, adventism, and the millennial kingdom of God on Earth (Zion). It is intertwined with revelations about the celestial world, proxy baptism for the deceased, temple endowments and sealings, and eternal marriage. This image of God logically and coherently orders and arranges some otherwise radically innovative and disparate beliefs and practices that Joseph Smith introduced in his brief prophetic career. 3 The concept of Heavenly Parents is the 73 This is more than merely speculation since the case of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS, now Community of Christ) provides an empirical point of comparison. The LDS and RLDS share a common history to 1844, although they understand portions of the history and teachings ofjoseph Smith differently. The RLDS rejected temple rituals, mostly because they were closely linked with plural marriage and did not incorporate the founding prophet's innovative image of God; but they did retain Smith's revelations about the celestial world and baptism for the dead. Yet these doctrines make little sense in terms of the more conventional biblical image of God favored by the RLDS. After years of pondering what to do with statements about baptism for the dead, the RLDS first relegated them to historical appendices in 1970 of the Doctrine and Covenants (107A, 109B, 110C) and then excluded them entirely from</page><page sequence="31">Danny L.

Heaven, the prophet revealed in 1832, consisted of three king doms—telestial, terrestrial, and celestial—or ascending degrees of glory (D&amp;C 76; also see Sections 88 and 131). Viewed retrospectively, this vision of the celestial world hinted strongly at the plurality of gods, material existence (embodiment) in heaven, and the possibility of human exaltation to godhood. Smith also introduced proxy bap tism for the deceased, as a necessary provision for the salvation of people who lived before the Mormon restoration, and he clarified its practice with further instructions in 1841 (D&amp;C 127; also see Section 137). Smith's most controversial teachings about eternal (plural) marriage and family relationships—as well as sacred temple rites (endowments and sealings), all of them introduced no later than 1843—are fundamentally intertwined with his alternative image of God. The Mormon temple rites inherently enacted Smith's theology of salvation, especially the principle of godly exaltation deriving from his unconventional image of multiple, material gods in the celestial world. The early Mormons became "kings and priests" or "queens and priestesses" in the celestial world through the temple endow ment and second anointing. Eternal marriage sealed partners to gether forever in the celestial world. Additional "sealing" practices, introduced during the 1840s, enabled other kinfolk, such as parents and children, or even unrelated individuals to be bound together eternally. Through the now-discontinued "law of adoption," Nauvoo Mormon leaders were sealed together in large, extended kinship groups for eternity.74 In principle and subsequent practice, the ex tension of all of these rites for the dead permitted forming kinships among both the living and the dead that would endure throughout eternity. Without the gender-inclusive image of a Heavenly Father and Mother, the Mormon theology of salvation makes little sense. The the canon. In the interests of theological consistency, it is reasonable to expect that the RLDS also eventually will repudiate the revelation on the celestial world. 74 Gordon Irving, "The Law of Adoption: One Phase of the Development of the Mormon Concept of Salvation, 1830-1900," BYU Studies 14 (Spring 1974): 291-314.</page><page sequence="32">126 The Journal of Mormon History progression of men and women to godhood and the creation/per petuation of celestial families is impossible to envision without the Heavenly Parents. Altogether these doctrines and ritual practices of salvation constitute the sacred core of this new American religion. This is Mormonism's central appeal. The very sense, coherence, and meaning of Mormon salvation necessarily depends on Joseph Smith's new, gender-inclusive image of God, inevitably including the Mother in Heaven. Mormonism's gender institution contains two principles: gender equality and patriarchy. The fact that gender equality is circumscribed by patriarchy has resulted in considerable tension and conflict in both theology and daily life. Resolution of this conflict will be difficult. Yet salvation of priesthood holders could not occur without the Church's women and, ultimately, the Mother in Heaven. In fine, Mormonism could not be what it is without the concept of the Heavenly Mother and the invaluable contributions of the Church's women.</page></plain_text>
