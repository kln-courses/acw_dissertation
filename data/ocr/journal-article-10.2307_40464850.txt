<plain_text><page sequence="1">Easter Island Does the Santiago Staff Bear a Cosmogonie Text? Jacques B. M. Guy In his article "Preliminary Evidence for Cosmo- gonie Texts in Rapanui's Rongorongo Inscrip- tions" Fischer (1995a) claims to have identified the nature of the contents of the Santiago Staff, corpus I of Barthel's classification, as a cosmogonie text. His methodology is deeply flawed and his con- clusions are contradicted by external and internal evidence. The only decipherment proposed, of a sequence of three glyphs, is at once a barbarism and a solecism, is incompatible with the context of the oral literature of Easter Island and Polynesia, and results in absurd readings for a text on another tablet. 1. Overview Easter Island was stripped bare of timber by the 18th century. Yet in a letter dated December 1864, Father Eugène Eyraud mentions the existence of hundreds of wooden tablets covered in hiero- glyphics. Two years later, Mgr Jaussen, Bishop of Tahiti, could only recover five tablets. Only twenty-one have survived. The writing on them is extraordinary. Tiny, remarkably regular glyphs, about one centimeter high, highly stylized and formalized, are carved in shallow grooves running the length of the tablets. Oral tradition has it that scribes used obsidian flakes or shark teeth to cut the glyphs and that writing was brought by the first colonists led by Hotu Matua. Last but not least, of the twenty-one surviving tablets three bear the same text in slightly different "spellings." In 1958 Thomas Barthel made the whole of the Easter Island corpus available in his "Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift," alas never translated into English. Almost forty years later now the tablets remain as much of an enigma. Their meaning remains unknown, except for two and a half lines of one tablet, which, beyond reasonable doubt, contain a lunar calendar, already identified as such by Barthel (1958), possibly serving as an astronomical canon for predicting when intercalary nights were to be inserted (Guy 1990). There is an obvious, very strong tendency for every third glyph of corpus I to have, appended to Anthropos 93.1998</page><page sequence="2">Berichte und Kommentare 553 it, glyph 76 of Barthel's nomenclature, which Bar- thel gives as probably meaning "penis." Fischer parallels this with the recitation known as "Atua Mata Riri," after its first words, collected on Easter Island in 1886 by William Thomson (1891) in response to his showing a photograph of tablet R to his informant Ure Vaeiko. This recitation consists of 48 verses, 41 of which are of the form (as per Thomson) "X, ki ai kiroto, Y, kapu te Z," i.e., "X copulated with Y, [whence] issued the Z", in which X and Y are proper names and Z is a common noun. Fischer equates glyph 76 "penis" with the notion of copulation, a reasonable semantic shift, and notes how the ternary pattern of corpus I echoes that of recitation "Atua Mata Riri," whence he concludes that it is a text of the same nature as "Atua Mata Riri," that is, a procreation chant or a "cosmogonie text," which discovery he hails as "the first scientifically verifiable identification of the genre of a rongorongo inscription" (Fischer 1995«: 303). Fischer appeals to the authority of science but he misrepresents its very principles. A theory, a hypothesis, a claim, is not scientifically verifiable, but only falsifiable; and it is void of scientific value if no test can be devised which may falsify it. Fischer violates these very principles by emitting an unfalsifiable hypothesis. The only decipherment proposed, very short, is implausible and the man- ner in which it was derived, applied to other textual fragments, yields absurd readings. His analysis of the Santiago Staff further suffers from fallacious reasoning, overfitting the data, ignoring contrary evidence, and eurocentricism. Unfalsifiable Hypothesis At first, Fischer (1995a: 311) suggests that reci- tation "Atua Mata Riri" is genuine: "It is likely that the chant, as Ure Va' e Iko had professed, was an original rongorongo composition that had been sung by the Rapanui tuhunga tã, the erstwhile experts in the script." One, then, would naturally expect corroborating evidence in the form of a partial decipherment of corpus I matching some verses of "Atua Mata Riri." But Fischer (1995«: 312) promptly eschews the issue and makes his theory unfalsifiable by suggesting that "Atua Mata Riri" is not genuine after all: "41 fanciful copu- lations and issues (many of which are evidently Ure' s own recent innovations or redactions)." An Implausible Decipherment Fischer (1995a: 316) only proposes one decipher- ment, for a sequence of three glyphs: te manu mau ki 'ai ki roto ki te ikay ka pü te ra 'ã "all the birds copulated with the fish: There issued forth the sun" (606.76-700-8, towards the middle of line 12 of Barthel's transcription of the Santiago Staff, Fig. 1). Not only is this text nowhere to be found in Easter Island nor in Polynesian mythologies, as he himself admits ("no Rapanui chant that reproduces this exact wording is known"; Fischer 1995a: 317), but it is also at once a barbarism and a solecism. A barbarism: mau is nowhere attested in the Easter Island language with the meaning "all," but it is a plural marker, probably borrowed from Tahitian for it does not occur in any of the chants nor in any older indigenous manuscripts. A solecism: as plural marker mau always precedes the noun, in Rapa Nui as in Tahitian. Further, the notion of birds copulating with fish is alien to the Easter Island and Polynesian lore, where creators and genitors are gods and goddesses, or cultural heroes, not mere animals, pluralized to boot. Nor is the glyph sequence 606.76 unique: Barthel's concordance gives 13 occurrences of it, all on the Santiago Staff (Barthel 1958: 112). Does the Santiago Staff, then, bear thirteen stories of birds copulating, none of which is attested in oral tradition? This decipherment is linguistically and culturally so improbable as to be certainly wrong. Absurd Readings There is, line 6, verso of tablet G (also know as Small Santiago Tablet) a sequence of signs read- ing, in Barthel's transcription: 200-D3507-280.76- 200 - 280 - D730.76 - 200 - 730 - 5 1 7a.76 - 200 - 5 1 7a - 222.76 (Fig. 2). This sequence, proposed by Bu- tinov and Knorozov as being a genealogy (see below), becomes under Fischer's decipherment: A copulated with X, there issued forth A, B copulated with X, there issued forth B, etc. Fallacious Reasoning When Fischer claims a commonality of literary genre between corpus I and "Atua Mata Riri" it is on the only evidence of a common ternary pattern. That is the old fallacy of the excluded middle: if two entities share one property, they share most or Anthropos 93.1998</page><page sequence="3">554 Berichte und Kommentare 305.76 V71 9:90 8:7.76 49f 606.76 700 8 90.76 20.10 600 379.51 VI. 76 Fig. 1: The sequence 606.76-700-8 on the Santiago Staff, in its context, with Barthel's transcription.

In an another article, in the Rapa Nui Journal, also reviewed by Bahn, Fischer (1995Z?) further relaxes his already loose criteria for paralleling corpus I with recitation "Atua Mata Riri." There he claims to have identified similar "cosmogonies" on (and here I quote Bahn 1996: 205) "eleven other tablets, all of them lacking the phallic suffix" (my emphasis). Overfitting the Data Fischer exaggerates his statistical observations to suit the purpose. He claims that "[three-glyph divisions and] longer divisions of glyphs comprise nearly always multiples of three" (1995a: 306 f.). But when one actually sits down to the task of counting the number of glyphs in each division one finds only 50 divisions out of 81 consisting of three glyphs or of a multiple of three (excluding from the count divisions containing erased or partly erased glyphs). Fischer reinterprets glyphs to suit the purpose. He claims that 97 "textual divisions" out of 98 begin with glyphs having phalloid glyph 76 suf- fixed: "each glyph that appears immediately to the right of one of these 97 vertical lines - is suffixed with a phallus-like glyph" (1995«: 306); but in fact, out of those 97 divisions, three start with the phalloid glyph standing on its own in isolation and seven start with glyphs with a very different, claw-shaped, suffix, identical to the head shapes of the anthropomorphic glyphs 300-399 of Barthel's nomenclature (Fig. 3). 2. Contrary Evidence Ignored An Alternative Interpretation of Glyph 76 In a paper published in 1957 in The Journal of the Polynesian Society, Nikolai Butinov and Yuri Knorozov give evidence of how a short recurring pattern, on line 6 of the verso of the Small San- tiago Tablet, may be a genealogy. This pattern, of the general form 200-A-B.76-200-B-C.76-200-C- D.76- ... (Fig. 2), is indeed quite clearly compatible with a genealogical list: King A son of B, King B son of C, etc. If that sequence is indeed a genealo- gy, then glyph 76 is very probably a taxogram for patronymics, and the Santiago Staff, which would Anthropos 93.1998</page><page sequence="4">Berichte und Kommentare 555 then mostly contain personal names, could well be a ta 'u, a hypothesis congruent with its physical appearance: about 125 cm long, 6 cm in diameter, it is likely a commander's baton. Dating the Writing System Fischer claims as a matter of fact that the writing is evidently a modern invention, prompted by the signing of the 1770 document of annexation by Spain. There is nothing evident there but prej- udice and eurocentricism. First, oral tradition has it that writing was brought by the first colonists, which would be about 400 AD. Second, textual analysis of the tablets H, P, and Q which bear the same text with minor variants, and A, which bears part of that text, rearranged and in a con- densed form, shows systematic variants betraying different schools of writing, evolved over time (Guy 1985). Third, two and a-half lines of tablet C contain a lunar calendar, already identified as such by Barthel forty years ago, which probably served to predict when intercalary nights had to be inserted to keep with the phases of the moon (Guy 1990), but none of Thomson's, Jaussen's, Rout- ledge's, Englert's and Métraux's informants men- tioned astronomical contents, and Metoro failed to recognize those two lines as such, in spite of the very transparent pictographic glyph for the full moon. The sense of most evident glyphs had thus been entirely forgotten by the time the tablets were discovered in the mid 1860's. For a writing system to emerge, evolve, flourish, and fall into complete oblivion it should take, one expects, far more than three generations. Eurocentricism In another piece of eurocentric reasoning Fischer interprets the glyph consisting of a mere vertical line as a text divider, a punctuation device in other words. This is again presented as a matter of fact, without any evidence. We may tend to accept this interpretation as self-evident, but it is only because of our education, ingrained reading habits, and ignorance of other writing systems that we do not entertain the notion that such a simple sign might serve other functions, as it does for instance in Ancient Egyptian where it usually marks ideograms standing for the actual object which they depict (Gardiner 1973). 3. Conclusion The deep methodological flaws in Fischer's anal- ysis and the improbability of his conclusions do not make those articles a contribution to the advancement of our understanding of the Easter Island writing. When we know that a tablet has been identified as containing a lunar calendar or perhaps an astronomical canon for predicting when intercalary nights should be inserted in the month, it is difficult to entertain the notion that the Easter Islanders got the idea of writing in 1770 from visiting Spaniards, had forgotten all about it by 1864, and meanwhile used the little timber they had to record stories of X copulating with Y to beget Z or himself, none attested in oral tradition.
