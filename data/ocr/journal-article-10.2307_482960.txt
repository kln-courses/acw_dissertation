<plain_text><page sequence="1">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time: Insights from Ethnohistory and Ethnography Bonnie Glass-Coffin, Utah State University Abstract. Using ethnohistorical and original ethnographic research, this article ex- plores the impact of gender on northern Peruvian shamanism. It suggests that structured gender inequality, in the colonial as well as contemporary eras, con- tributes to gender differences in both conception of illness and strategy for cure. Specifically, gender differences in socially defined roles, including gender-specific definitions of morality, make women especially vulnerable to accusations of sor- cery. Similarly, women sometimes manipulate sorcery beliefs to absolve themselves from blame when unable to live up to role expectations. The article argues that female shamans encourage women to accept these gendered definitions of morality as an important preamble to empowerment and cure, thus allowing women to utilize their oppression to create meaning even when this cannot be easily tran- scended. Finally, the article positions these ethnographic findings within feminist theories in both anthropology and theology. Throughout most of human history there has existed an asymmetry in the relations of power, representation, knowledge and scholarship between men and women. Thus there exists a large agenda to be addressed in order to overcome women's in- visibility, marginalization and subordination in history and society. -Ursula King, Religion and Gender Recently, Ursula King challenged researchers to take gender as a critical category in the analysis of religious traditions. This article attempts to do just that. It explores Peruvian shamanism as the product of a colo- nial encounter that continues to structure gender inequality. It asserts that contemporary Peruvian shamanism, like many other religious traditions, reflects a social reality of structured gender inequality even while providing a discourse of resistance to it. In other words, the meanings generated in Ethnohistory 46: z (spring i999) Copyright (? by the American Society for Ethnohistory.</page><page sequence="2">zo6 Bonnie Glass-Coffin Peruvian shamanism are molded and constrained by a symbolic repertoire that has its foundations in the "ideologies of the conquerors." 1 The focus of the article is on gender; on how gender has affected the conception of illness and therapeutic strategies of the healers in this re- gion, on the historical reasons for these gendered differences, and on how the northern Peruvian case can be viewed in the wider context of feminist theory about the representation of religious experience in postcolonial con- texts. In deference to King's challenge, the article has descriptive, critical, and methodological components. It adds new information about women- a class of healers who have been largely voiceless in the literature on Peruvian shamanism. It also attempts to deconstruct and reconstruct this shamanic tradition in a way that reveals its message (and meaning) for women living in the shadow of patriarchy. It suggests gender-specific defi- nitions of morality, sin, and redemption that allow Peruvian women to use shamanic symbols to assert self-worth and to reclaim identity in a social setting where female role expectations are overdetermined and defined by male others. Finally, the paper suggests a methodology for inquiry that transcends the problematic categories of theory and practice in feminist scholarship. It follows Sherry Ortner's exhortation to focus on the "game" rather than the "agent." It suggests that this is one way of overcoming the feminist dilemmas of free agency versus structural bondage, of woman as nominal versus essential category, and of dealing with the paradox that women "accept" the reality of structured gender inequality even as they work to resist the limitations for controlling their own destinies which this reality implies (Ortner i996). Background In the coastal deserts of northern Peru and the rugged Andes mountains that rise to the east, an ancient shamanic tradition thrives.2 Here, healers called maestros (masters/teachers) or brujos curanderos (witch curers) work to cure their patients of sorcery, or danio.3 By means of a psychoactive alka- loid found in the San Pedro cactus (Trichocereus pachanoi), these healers enter an altered state of consciousness. Their "shadows," or souls, leave their bodies and travel into other worlds, where they communicate with spirit powers to diagnose the cause of disease. Then they restore their patients to health with the help of magically charged altars called mesas. We know from the archaeological record that the use of San Pedro predates the sixteenth-century arrival of the Spanish conquistadores by at</page><page sequence="3">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time zo7 Figure i. The veiled (female) shaman in this ceramic vessel of the Moche tradition (ca. 100 B.C.-A.D. 700) is using what appears to be rocks to cleanse a prostrate patient lying in front of her. The colonial literature talks at length of "pardon" rocks used to cleanse people of their sins as well as of sacred stones that em- bodied the buaca ancestors. Rocks are also key mesa artifacts used to cleanse the patients of contemporary northern shamans. (Collection of the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia y Antropologia_ Lima.) least two thousand years. Stone etchings of the Chavin tradition (I500 B.C.- 900 B.C.) as well as beautifully preserved pottery from the Cupusnique (900 B.C.-ZOO B.C.), Salinar (ZOO B.C.-A.D. ioo), Nazca (zoo B.C.-A.D. 6oo), Moche (400 B.C.-A.D. 8oo), Lambayeque (A.D. 8oo-I350), and Chimu (A.D. I000-A.D. I476) traditions all depict the San Pedro cactus, often in association with anthropomorphic or clearly human beings who may have been healers or priests. The tradition of ingesting the hallucinogenic San Pedro brew to make normally invisible worlds visible was apparently practiced by women as well as men (Figure i). In one stirrup pot from the Lambayeque tradition, a veiled figure (the veil indicates that the wearer is female) cradles a piece of the sacred cactus in her left hand. Her closed eyes, slightly open mouth, and raised right hand make her appear absorbed in prayer or transfigured by trance. One can only guess at the content of her thoughts since no writ- ten documentation accompanies the visual record. It is only later, when</page><page sequence="4">zo8 Bonnie Glass-Coffin the Church fathers began documenting the religious and healing traditions of those they colonized and hoped to convert, that words were added to the picture. From these reports, we know the sun and the moon were worshiped as key and complementary deities, each presiding over a world "half" char- acterized by such contrasting qualities as right/left, sky/earth-sea, man/ woman, fertility/fecundity, conquering/autochthonous. Also worshiped were the stars, wind, sea, mountains, caves, springs, rivers, lagoons, oddly shaped rocks and plants, and the mummified remains of human ancestors.4 Worship of these deities was conducted by outstanding individuals- women as well as men-who invoked their divine power (called huaca) at specific times of the year on behalf of the human communities they represented. They fed the gods with offerings of blood, fat, and corn beer, confident of reciprocal acts of protection and nurturance. They acted as confessors of their communities and oversaw the ritual baths that served to purify and pardon those who had revealed their wrongs to the gods in search of forgiveness. Additional tasks of these ritual specialists in- cluded divining the future and interpreting the acceptability of sacrifice as well as healing the sick who were afflicted with disease because of their transgressions against the gods or against the society in which they lived.5 In one example of how women served as huaca guardians, reported by the Jesuit missionary Pablo de Arriaga (i968 [i6z0]: 36-37) in the early seventeenth century, we learn, In a town in the province of Conchucos . . . there was a girl about fourteen years of age, of rare beauty. For this reason her parents and the [town leaders] dedicated her to the service of a stone huaca named Chanca, which had the face of a person. They married her to this huaca, and everyone in town celebrated her wedding, staying out on a hill for three days with much carousing. They offered their sacrifices by the hand of this girl and considered it a proper and a lucky thing to do. They thought that sacrifices thus performed would be most acceptable to the huacas.... She was held in the greatest reverence and regarded as a divine and superior being. Arriaga described the rituals of these indigenous priests and priest- esses in some detail. He told how the huaca guardians would invoke the spirit and power of the deities by means of "blowing" the sacred kiss called mocha, a gesture of reverence for holy objects and places that may be the same as that depicted in this Moche ceramic (Figure z) of a thousand years earlier. It is a gesture that is still practiced by curanderos in the north. Arriaga and other chroniclers also described the way that the healers</page><page sequence="5">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time 209 Figure2z. Like most mesas of northern curanderos, this one has pre-Colombian and Christian artifacts as well as rocks, shells, knives, swords, and staffs (most of the staffs of this healer's mesa are set up in a line about ten feet in front of the ground objects and are, thus, not included in the picture). The brewed San Pedro is in the pot at the far right. At the left of the picture is a portion of this healer's second mesa, which she uses for defense and for "cleansing" only. and priest-confessors would cleanse their parishioners by rubbing their bodies with sacred stones called pasca (which means pardon), guinea pigs, ropes, staffs, or white cornmeal or other powders, to absorb their sins and capture their illness. Then the confessors would blow over these "into the air as a signal that the sins had flown away" (Valcarcel n.d.: 33). This ritual purlification with the pasca stones by a female healer-confessor may be that which is being depicted in this Moche stirrup pot. For contemporary curanderos as well, cleansing the patient with stones, guinea pigs, ropes, and staffs is also an important part of their curing ceremonies. So, it would seem that there is some continuity between the visual representation of ritual depicted on pre-Colombian ceramics, the writ- ten documentation of "idolatrous" behavior recorded by colonial Church fathers, and contemporary ritual practice. But, in spite of the archaeologi- cal and historical record that women were priestesses and healers and full participants in this shamanic tradition, when I arrived in Peru in search of contemporary female healers, or curanderas, I was often told that I would not find many women who were healers, although there were certainly</page><page sequence="6">zIo Bonnie Glass-Coffin those who practiced Evil. Further, I was informed that while women might transform themselves into black cats, ducks, pigs, or goats and take to the air to attend secret reunions with the Devil, they would certainly not ingest San Pedro or cure with the aid of the mesa.6 In spite of these folkloric and popular ideas, over the next two years I worked with eight women who did diagnose their patients' afflictions with the help of the San Pedro cactus.7 Their mesas were similar in many ways to both those described in the colonial literature and to those of their contemporary male counterparts. These contained the stones, staffs, white cornmeal, and ropes described above as well as many Christian images, reflecting the syncretism between Catholic and pre-Colombian traditions that has resulted from continued attempts to extinguish "pagan" beliefs and "replace" these with the precepts of Catholic faith and dogma. Their prayers were to God and the Virgin, Christ and the saints, as well as the spirit-powers of lagoons and waterfalls, mountains and caves. They blew fragrant liquids in offering to these powers, and cleansed their patients by rubbing them with the objects from their mesas. Given the archaeological evidence and my ultimate success encoun- tering and working with female healers, why are Peruvian folklore and popular belief so infused with these gender-based differences in percep- tion? A brief discussion of twenty cases of "idolatrous and superstitious behavior" recorded in the Dioceses of Trujillo between I752 and I8z5 sug- gests some answers to this question. There is, as revealed in these cases, a historical dimension for the perception that women are more likely than men to harm their neighbors, family, and friends through the use of sorcery (Figure 3). In eight of the cases consulted, the accused are men (Archivos Arzobispales de Trujillo [AAT] I752, I768, I77ib, I800, I804, I8I3, I8I7, I824).8 In nine cases they are women (AAT I77ia, I77c, I774a, I774b, I778, I786, i809, i8i8, I8z5). One of the remaining three cases was brought against a priest accused of beating a female parishioner to death in an attempt to extract her confession (AAT I79I) and the other two document the discovery and destruction of idols associated with "pagan" forms of worship (AAT i8io, i8I4). Gender Differences in Idolatry, Eighteenth-Century Trujillo For the men accused of idolatrous behavior, the descriptions include de- tailed information about their mesas and their use of the San Pedro cactus, as well as accounts of their all-night healing rituals and attempts to cure sorcery-related illness. There is much similarity between the descriptions</page><page sequence="7">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time . . . . . . 2II 0 . . ,, 0 0 4: f . ;0 . - ,; g 0 0: . - 0f : . f, 0 0 0, , . ., 0 , ., , j ,. . . .. ............... , . .,.. ., ,,........ ... .-. -..- -......... -......... ... ..

For example, in the case recorded in I768 against Marcos Marcelo, when the ecclesiastic judge asked the defendant to explain the nature and the process of his cures: [The defendant] said that when a sick person who believed he was bewitched solicited [him] . . . he first cooked an herb that he always has; which is called Gigantes [another name for San Pedro] . . . and that he drank the juice of this herb . . . with which he came into full awareness and patently saw with his eyes the sick person's [be- witchment] ... and he also recognized the sorcerer who had done the [harm]. (AAT I768) When asked about the contents of his mesa, the accused replied: Twelve of [the rocks], were useful for cleansing patients . . . these he had taken from the Cuculi mountain in which his wind [spirit power] lived. (Ibid.) In another of the cases, brought against Juan Pablo Arispe in I804, we learn that his mesa included a cross and half a dozen candles, as well as shells, gourds, bones, hair, and round, black and white rocks. Conversely, in the cases brought against the women, there is no men- tion of the mesa or the San Pedro. Further-unlike the male defendants interviewed-the women are accused of having pacts and liaisons with the Devil and of harming or killing their families or neighbors, or de- stroying crops and livestock. They are accused of lascivious, self-serving, and immoral behavior, like dancing half-naked around a carob tree (AAT I774b); consorting with and pledging allegiance to a fire-emitting goat- Devil (AAT I774a, I786); having sexual intercourse with an incubus (AAT i8i8); poisoning victims out of jealousy, envy, retribution, or selfish desire for material wealth (AAT I77ia, I771c, I774b, I786, I79I); "taming" and controlling the men in their lives (or the lives of their female clients) via love magic (AAT I77c, I8z5); and transforming into animal or satanic guise in order to facilitate their mischief (AAT I77ia, I774b, I786, i8i8). Some of the women admitted to using their knowledge of herbs to rectify the social injustices of being victims of a system that privileged men. For example, an Indian woman named Maria Francisca was accused by the chief magistrate of the region of poisoning an apple with hair and other porquerias and of banding together with other women to force their will on unsuspecting men (AAT I77ia).9 In her defense, Maria Francisca admitted to being an herbalist, who "when she was a young girl . .. was very inclined to want to know the art of the Yervatera, not to do harm to anyone, but so that men of respect would love and esteem her; and</page><page sequence="9">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time zI3 also so that her deceased husband would esteem and love her; that he had illicit commerce with another woman [and] maltreated her in word and deed, and that they always lived badly" (ibid.). But justifying use of occult powers to level the playing field of sexual abuse or battery did not im- press the judges. In spite of her rationale for her actions, Maria Francisca's goods were confiscated, and she spent the next three years in jail. To summarize, whereas the cases brought against the men empha- sized their healing activities, all of the women were accused of having committed some kind of evil-love magic, intent to cause illness, death, or destruction of property via magical means. Although some of the accused women admitted to what was viewed by the accusers as patently antisocial behavior, those who admitted their guilt attempted to justify their behav- ior as a defense against a socially structured injustice that required the negation of their autonomy. Those doing the accusing were often other members of these women's communities rather than either the women themselves or the ecclesiastic authorities.10 This indicates an internaliza- tion of European dogma about witchcraft and devil worship as well as of colonial moral codes. It also indicates that by the mid-eighteenth century, people had learned how to manipulate the ecclesiastic courts to serve a variety of personal agendas.1' In all the cases reviewed, it was only after multiple confessions that the accused women admitted to their crimes; that these confessions exist as part of the ecclesiastic record at all suggests that women, more than men, were expected to confess to the behaviors and ideas of which the Church fathers suspected them, and that they were questioned (and tortured) until they did. The contrasting perceptions in these cases, as well as in the popular lore surrounding beliefs about contemporary male and female healers can be traced to the Continental dogma that accompanied the Church fathers on their voyages to the New World. According to this European paradigm, all idolatrous and heretical activity was considered inspired by the Devil and effected by the witches who worshiped him. Women were targeted as witches in the New World for the same reasons that they were persecuted by the Church in Europe. They were believed to be both insatiably lustful and morally, intellectually, and physically inferior to men. Since sexual passion and carnal desire were the Devil's domain, and since women could not control their passions, they were believed to be an easy target for de- monic seduction. Further, according to the logic of the era, women were perceived as more vengeful than men, and more given to anger, pride, and greed. When confronted with their own inferior position in God's king- dom they supposedly turned to the Devil to wreak revenge upon those who were by their very nature superior.</page><page sequence="10">ZI4 Bonnie Glass-Coffin By I484 these ideas had become codified in a bull of Pope Innocent VIII, which gave the Church fathers guidelines of behavior and activities to look for in the suspected witch. Within two years, the Malleus ma- leficarum (The Witches' Hammer) was published in Europe and quickly distributed. Chapter titles such as "Of the Way whereby a Formal Pact with Evil is Made" and "How They [witches] are Transported from Place to Place" told inquisitors in exact detail how to recognize a witch (Kraemer and Sprenger I970 [I486]: vii-x). Thanks to documents like the Malleus and well-read tracts of the early seventeenth-century, which described the witches' sabbath in lurid detail, the Church fathers had very clear ideas of the behavior that they expected to find when they began their campaigns in Peru to stamp out heresy and idolatry. In the Trujillo cases, where women-but not men-were accused of diabolical deeds like those described above, it seems clear that these "his- tories" of women have been colored by the expectations and ideologies of those who recorded them. As Irene Silverblatt (I987: xxi-xxii) reminds us, "History making ... is a cultural invention ... made by those who dominate ... and then universalized to celebrate their heroes and to silence dissent." The Hidden Transcript of Gender What dissent did these histories silence, and why do these tales still in- form popular ideas about female healers in the region? A clue may be that women accused of being witches in northern Peru-both then and now- are among those who struggle to affirm their autonomy in a world that forces them into economic, political, social, and even emotional depen- dence. These are women who challenge the inherent "superiority" of men as well as privileged male authority and power. Some compete with men in the marketplace. Others challenge the "male right" to have affairs or demand equal sexual freedom for themselves. In many of the cases from Trujillo summarized above, the accused were those who had been widowed and who, thus, had more say in the administration of their goods and land than if they had been married. In at least two cases, the accused were wealthy or politically powerful women and it was the envy of one less fortunate that prompted the accusations (AAT I774a, I778). In another three cases, the accused were powerful in other ways (AAT I77ia, I77Ic, I79I). As herbalists and healers they were perceived as having power over birth and death, and over the formation or dissolution of marriage ties. Finally, in one case, we learn that the accused was sought out by a young woman who was tired of being beaten by her</page><page sequence="11">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time 2I5 husband (AAT I825). From the apparent "witch" she received refuge, as well as an ointment to quell her husband's abuse. In all these cases, an under- lying theme of witchcraft accusations is that of the threat posed by women who challenge patriarchy and the corresponding inequities of a society that denies women the right to social, economic, or sexual autonomy. There was a strong moral component to these accusations. In colonial Latin America women's morality was associated with the Marian virtues of virginity/chastity, obedience to male "tutors," and the ideals of long- suffering motherhood and service to God.12 In this environment, women who could not or would not conform to the expectations of sublation that characterized their social position as dependents (because of their autonomous status as widows, independent businesswomen, or healers) were more vulnerable to witchcraft accusations than those women who served husbands, fathers, and children while muting their own desires as individuals."3 In contemporary times, some of these same themes emerge. The female healers I worked with the most closely used their healing powers to assert economic as well as social independence. Those who were unmarried were -thanks to their healing vocation -economically and politically powerful in addition to being unencumbered by a husband's demands. Those who were married used their abilities to gain prestige and economic indepen- dence that was not typical of women's roles. Many of these women empha- sized personal empowerment and autonomy in their therapeutic strategies as well. They taught an ethic in which their patients were encouraged to assert responsibility for their own futures as a means of overcoming ill- ness. But because of their relative autonomy in a society where female independence is considered morally ambiguous and dangerous, an under- lying and recurrent theme in their discussions of illness and healing was the importance of overcoming the "temptations" of immorality, both in their own lives and as an imperative for healing in the lives of their patients. These temptations took many forms, primarily improper sexual conduct, aggressive/self-serving (as opposed to community-oriented/suffering-for- others) behavior, and outward defiance of the God-given order of correct and complementary male/female relations.'4 The historical antecedents for perceiving those women who enjoy a certain measure of autonomy as threats to the patriarchal order seem clear. But how do these social ten- sions of dependence/autonomy, of morality/immorality, and of the role played by accusations and invocations of sorcery relate to the situation of women struggling to cope with institutionalized gender inequalities in contemporary Peru?</page><page sequence="12">zi6 Bonnie Glass-Coffin Sorcery and Shamanism in Contemporary Northern Peru In northern Peru, social relationships are overdetermined- dependence on the support of family and friends is necessary for economic, social, and even emotional survival. But, especially in urban areas where sorcery accu- sations are most common, income-generating potential is based more on redistributive and mercantile rather than productive activities. Disposable income for purchasing goods and services is limited. Additionally, working for wages often pits individual and family in a dialectic of tension, com- petition, and frustration. Because of these economic and social features of the Peruvian landscape, accusations of sorcery are most often directed inward-toward the close relatives, business partners, and neighbors who are both potential sources for support and potential competitors for scarce resources.'5 This was certainly the case among the women of El Bosque, a poor neighborhood on the southernmost edge of Chiclayo, Peru. As part of my research on gender and shamanism, I interviewed fifteen neighborhood women, ranging in age from twenty-four to fifty-nine, about the gender inequality they have experienced in their lives and about their personal experiences as victims of sorcery. These women all agreed that men have privilege and power that they do not share and that this privilege is some- times abused in ways that harm them. One area of common concern was the ability to get enough money to care for their children. It was common in this neighborhood, as it is in much of Latin America, for women to be charged with the organization and administration of domestic life, in- cluding all aspects of child care. As Carmen Pimentel Sevilla (I988: I75) has noted in her discussions of gender relations in contemporary Peru, men frequently assert that "the children are their mothers, . . . they are her obligation." But, while women are supposed to clothe and feed their children, they are not supposed to work outside the home (Grandon I987: I8). Instead, women are supposed to meet their children's needs for food and clothing through their management of domestic resources. But, since most women living in urban and periurban settings don't have the nec- essary land for growing enough food or raising enough ducks, chickens, or guinea pigs to feed their children on a daily basis, they either depend on a daily allowance from their husbands or look beyond the home for supplemental income sources. But, even in the poorer neighborhoods like El Bosque where husbands cannot afford to, they often resist rather than support their wives' efforts to supplement that daily allowance. This causes</page><page sequence="13">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time 2I7 increased social, economic, and emotional conflicts within the household (Pimentel Sevilla i988). Daniela's story about the conflicts between her husband's lack of eco- nomic support and his insistence that she not work outside the home was especially telling.16 Although her husband worked as a radio repairman and owned his own tools, he didn't have a steady job. When he did work, he gave her a daily allowance to buy food for their two young girls, but it was rarely enough to cover costs. She complained, but he retorted, "I am nobody's slave ... not for you, nor for your children will I work." When he went to Lima to look for more-steady employment, he sent no money home, so she began making food to sell at a table she set up just outside her doorway. In this way she made enough to support her children. But when he returned from Lima, he insisted she quit selling food, telling her that it made him look like a poor provider. She agreed to the request, but insisted that he support her. He did-for a week, then quit supporting her again. When he began having an affair with another woman living in the household she confronted him. He abused her verbally and hit her, so she left, eventually marrying another man who treated her more kindly. She had four more children with her new husband and the couple seemed happy. But then, according to Daniela, a neighbor woman became inter- ested in him and initiated an affair. To assure her position as his mistress (and in an attempt to displace Daniela as his legitimate wife), the woman also began spreading rumors that Daniela was sleeping with a younger man. Her husband beat Daniela viciously and she left to work as a do- mestic servant in Lima. Eventually she returned home, and they agreed to a mutual separation with the following conditions: The husband would continue to live in the house (which Daniela had bought with the help of her mother) and would support the children with whatever money he could. They would remain married but he would, in essence, live "his own life." Daniela would continue raising the children, feeding and clothing them, and was free to work in whatever capacity outside the home that she could in order to supplement the income. Compared to many of the women that I interviewed, Daniela and her husband considered themselves lucky to have such an equitable arrangement. Daniela's story illustrates a double standard in Peruvian working- class gender relations. Men take up with other women while demanding long-suffering fidelity of their wives. Because of their own marginalized employment status, these men are often unable to care for their children. But they deny their wives the opportunity to work outside the home to help bridge the family income gap. They rationalize that children are "the</page><page sequence="14">zi8 Bonnie Glass-Coffin women's responsibility" and yet make it impossible for their wives to meet this responsibility. Instead, these men insist that their wives remain eco- nomically dependent on their incomes. They are in control of their time and their money in a way that is denied to women. This is the ethic of machismo. It is an ethic that is common, not only in Peru, but in much of Latin America where the colonial legacy of structured gender inequality still denies women the economic and social autonomy that men enjoy, and blames women who cannot (or will not) cope with this double standard.'7 Yet in spite of these double standards and the verbal and physical abuse endured by the women I interviewed, most chose to remain with their husbands rather than strike out on their own. Their rationale was economic, but also social and emotional. Their dependence had been in- ternalized, as had their self-blame for their own inabilities to cope with double standards of machismo. As Alexandra told me, "So many times I thought of separating from him, but I put up with everything.... I raised my children. . . . I have had to be husband and wife. . . . [Even so], I, like my children, have to ask permission from him, he is the boss." And when I asked Celina, a single mother with three children, what she felt was most important in a woman's life she said, "a husband's support. If one has no husband, there is no respect. People will try to abuse you, even in your home." Even Roberta, whose husband's beatings were legendary throughout the neighborhood, told me that she received little support from her women friends when she attempted to break out of that abusive rela- tionship. According to Roberta, even her closest friends told her that the beatings were understandable, considering that she had chosen to work outside the home instead of keeping to her house like a "good woman" should. Although it may be difficult to understand why working-class women would react this way to such abuse, the development of a dependent per- sonality seems a logical outgrowth of the economic and social double-bind in which women find themselves. According to this view, the double stan- dard of machismo makes women vulnerable to physical, psychological, and even moral abuse when their behavior does not conform with expected norms. They, rather than the unworkable system in which they live, are blamed for their shortcomings. This abuse debilitates women's sense of self-worth when experienced over time, and women come to internalize their domination by others and to see it as a natural and legitimate state of affairs. Women's very identity becomes other-directed and overdetermined and women become very concerned about what others may say (or think) about their shortcomings.</page><page sequence="15">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time ZI9 Many of the women that I interviewed in El Bosque invoked daio as a way of dealing with a system that blames them for the inability to live up to the unreasonable demands of these double standards. Roberta and Alex- andra both blamed the "other woman" for doing dafio to their husbands so they would forget about their responsibilities to wives and children. According to Roberta, her first husband's mistress stole her child's diaper and took it to a sorcerer so that the child would sicken and die, and so she would begin drinking. The goal (which was achieved) was that her husband would become disgusted with her behavior and leave her to set up a household with the mistress. Her drinking was seen by neighbors as a legitimate reason for her husband's abandonment. But the invocation of sorcery as a reason for her lapse helped absolve her of blame. In summary, accusations of sorcery seem intimately linked with eco- nomic, social, and emotional stress in this region of the world. Sorcery also seems to correlate with an other-directed or "heteronomous" definition of self.'8 This internalized definition requires women to blame themselves (and to expect to be blamed by others) when unable to be both dependent on their husbands and successful at feeding their children. One way to understand sorcery in this context is as an escape valve for the inability to cope with structured gender inequalities. There is a moral component to sorcery accusations in El Bosque, just as in the past. Women are considered morally ambiguous and dangerous when they are unable (or unwilling) to accept being economically depen- dent on their male relatives or husbands, when they refuse to accept the double standard that requires their chastity, fidelity, and long-suffering resignation to male sexual exploits and when they put their own needs ahead of those of their children.19 These are the women who are vulner- able to accusations of sorcery. Similarly, the women who are victims of sorcery are those who have succumbed to the temptations of individual desire, sexual impropriety, inattention to their children's needs, or other gender-specific antisocial behavior.20 This structured gender inequality affects the way that sorcery is per- ceived by both victims and accusers. It should come as no surprise that male and female healers define illness and healing in accordance with these beliefs. By way of introduction to this discussion, I turn first to a summary of male and female patterns of healing as expressed in the symbolism of the mesa, then explore the role of overcoming "temptation" via penance and suffering, and of positioning oneself closer to God (thus reclaiming the moral high road) as key components in the healing ethic of curanderas in Peru.</page><page sequence="16">220 Bonnie Glass-Coffin Male and Female Models of Healing The dependent relationships in northern Peru that I describe above are not limited to gender. In addition to a cultural landscape in which indi- vidual success at acquiring wealth directly clashes with social obligations to family and community, the geography and economy of this urbanizing desert landscape conspire to create relations of dependence for all its in- habitants. "Who you know" becomes an important catalyst for everything from putting food on the table to getting good medical attention to ex- pediting court orders in a society where economic infrastructure is both lacking and corrupt. Because social tensions cannot be expressed directly (for fear of alienating potential allies in the future), sorcery accusations provide an outlet for the frustrations that accompany overdetermined and overdependent lives. Suspicion, frustration, and competition underlie the most intimate social relationships and, not surprisingly, sorcery accusa- tions are most often brought against close family members and friends- those upon whom one depends for economic, social, and emotional sur- vival. In this environment worldviews are oppositional and adversarial, and this ethos influences the lives and practices of healers and those of their patients.21 According to Donald Joralemon and Douglas Sharon's (I993: i67) research with male shamans in the region, "There is an adversarial quality found in the accounts of curanderos' lives and therapeutic philosophies ... [they] express an oppositional view of the world they live in, a black-and- white struggle between forces of good and evil." These oppositional forces are made manifest on the healer's mesa. They are forces which must be dominated or transcended to effect a cure. According to this oppositional logic, mesa objects are situated on the right or on the left side of the mesa in campos or fields. They embody good/evil or life-giving/life-taking forces. Those objects placed in the center field of the mesa mediate and transcend these oppositions. As Joralemon (I984: IO) suggests, the mesa serves as a kind of "game board." Healing is transacted because, by acting upon the mesa objects, the curandero also acts upon the oppositional forces that they represent in the patients' lives. As R. Donald Skillman (I990: I4) summarizes it, "The resolution of opposites that occurs on the mesa is a kind of symbolic cipher for the resolution of conflicts in the lives of the healer's patients." An emphasis on combat is a common theme in the ritual practices of these male healers. This is understandable considering the emphasis on opposition and the resolution of opposing forces that underlies the heal-</page><page sequence="17">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time 221 ing philosophy of these men. For several of the male healers summarized in Joralemon and Sharon's work (I993) both mesa objects and symbolic action graphically express this metaphor. The left side of Victor Neyra's mesa, for example, contains knives, stone mace-heads, swords, and even a pistol (ibid.: 33). And in Roberto Rojas's mesa, "the largest cluster of objects on the left side . .. consists of eighteen pre-Columbian 'Warrior' Ceramics that form Roberto's 'army' of spirits, helping him to cure curses and ailments associated with pre-Hispanic ruins. The next largest group in- cludes stones from pre-Columbian sites used to 'counter-arrest' the attacks of sorcerers" (ibid.: 83). In Rojas's ceremony, the symbolic emphasis on combat is evident. As Sharon (ibid.: 84) describes it, "Grabbing his iron serpent from the head of the mesa and the skull from the Ganadero, Roberto would charge into the open and engage in an aggressive spirit battle with his adversary. He would curse, yell, and throw the skull and serpent staff at the enemy, unseen ex- cept by him." This ritual enactment is not unique, as Sharon (ibid.) notes, but is also found among other shamans, although the specific techniques employed vary according to the personality and style of the healer. According to Joralemon and Sharon (ibid.: 3I) these male healers typi- cally stressed dominating or overcoming evil on behalf of the patient. The role of the curandero was to reshape the patient's suffering in terms of these oppositions and to move the patient from affliction to relief. Through the course of the all-night ritual, and using the dialectical symbolism of the mesa, the healer battled the sorcerer who had harmed the patient, har- nessing the forces of good and dominating evil on the patient's behalf. As Sharon (I978: I46-47) summarizes it, the patient's participation "is not much different from his participation in orthodox religion: It is activated when expedient and experienced vicariously."22 However, if these social and economic stresses of dependence inform therapeutic strategies for male as well as female healers, their positions and social options as men and women also condition their response to these. Thus, the documented male healers worked to overcome dependence by using metaphors of aggression and transcendence to assert their dominance and autonomy. But the five female healers with whom I worked took a much different approach to healing.23 These women ranged in age between thirty and forty-four years old (in i989). Vicky, Flormira, and Isabel lived near the northern capital of Chiclayo. Yolanda and Clorinda lived in or near the highland towns of Cajamarca and Huancabamba, respectively. Vicky and Yolanda were married with children at the time of my study and their husbands worked with them in their healing rituals. Isabel and Flor</page><page sequence="18">222 Bonnie Glass-Coffin were divorced and raising children and grandchildren as single parents. Clorinda had never been married. Their economic situations varied from nearly destitute to comfortable. In spite of these differences in their individual backgrounds, the women showed some striking similarities in their understandings of illness and their approach to healing. Sexual politics and the autonomy/depen- dence of women was an area of concern for all five. Clorinda (the only one of the five who had never married) asserted that this autonomy is what gives women the power to heal. According to Clorinda, healers must be strong to resist spirit attack and by nature, women are more powerful than men. As she told me, "The cures of a female healer can only be undone by God." But, she added, married women cannot cure "because they are weak." On a more practical note, she commented that it is difficult for a married woman to reconcile domestic responsibilities with the demands of healing. A married woman must attend to her husband, but a healer works all night and must, therefore, rest during the day. Also, husbands are likely to be jealous of their wives since being a healer requires having private consultations with patients (including men). Clorinda's response was to remain single. Her father had already died when I met her and she had inherited his mesa and his profession. Her position as the major bread- winner for her mother and nine younger siblings gave her considerable autonomy and power in the household. Vicky expressed similar concerns, and her marriage had caused early problems for her as a healer. But her ability to bring in a significant portion of the family income as well as her decision to incorporate her husband into her practice as an assistant had quieted his jealousies and validated his position as the head of the family. Her specialty was doing love magic for her clients, and she was acutely aware (and critical) of the double standard that governs male and female sexual behavior. But, as she lamented dur- ing one conversation, all her power to manipulate the passions of others had served her very little at home. Her husband had taken a mistress (and had probably had a child by her) and Vicky felt frustrated at her inability to manage his desires even as she resigned herself to the realities of the machista world in which she lived. While Vicky and Clorinda felt the double standards of socially sanc- tioned male autonomy and female dependence just like the other women in my sample, their healing strategies and mesa symbolism were more like that of their male counterparts than the three women I describe below. This was, perhaps, because they had been socialized into their occupation as curanderas by male relatives. Like the men, their ritual process was pat- terned. These two women healed the patients by invoking the powers of</page><page sequence="19">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time 223 the right, then of the left, then the right sides of his mesa in a three-part ritual format that "replicates a shamanic journey in the classical sense" (Joralemon and Sharon I993: i66). Like the men, they also cured "on their patients' behalf," transcending the primordial struggles between good and evil, life-giving and life-taking forces, and the knowable and the inchoate, transforming them into passages for their patients.24 But the other three women-those who found their path to healing without apprenticing to male relatives-approached their relationship to patients and their roles as healers in markedly different ways than their male counterparts. While all three women used the mesa and ingested the hallucinogenic San Pedro to facilitate healing, and while all shared the same cosmology of good/evil, God/Devil, or "this world/otherworld" that was the foundation of the male healers' ceremonies, these women's cures differed from those of their male counterparts in at least two ways. First, rather than dominating, overcoming, or transcending these oppositional dualisms to effect a cure, Isabel, Flor, and Yolanda juxtaposed these cate- gories to illustrate their differences and persuade their patients to make a choice. Second-as suggested by the previous statement-their cures were not transformative in the sense that patients could benefit vicariously from the mediatory action of the healer. Instead of viewing their clients as pas- sive victims, dependent on the shaman's power to transform their suffering, these women emphasized the agency of the sufferer-both in facilitating and overcoming their illness. For them, healing was not viewed as external to the patient, but rather as a force which the patient had to awaken in him or herself. This awakening required confession of past sins, penance, and a sincere desire to overcome the temptations of the immoral behavior that had facilitated their illness in the first place. It required "coming closer to God" and getting morally right with the forces of the universe. These three viewed their roles more as "guides" or "teachers" than "transformers." Key to their philosophies was a conviction that illness is associated with "temptation." Yolanda, for example, described sorcery as the condition of being "far from God" as well as being "morally crooked" and in need of "spiritual rehabilitation." She asserted that it was the conciencia, or spiritual state of the victim, which was the root cause of the illness. She further asserted that the cure required internal transformation and a desire to "turn one's back on sin" as well as a sincere attempt to act according to moral and social mandates, including sexual purity, service to others, and a willingness to suffer. To further illustrate these ideas, she recounted her own experience with temptation, penance, suffering, and redemption. As a young child, she told me that she had been the victim of love magic. Against her better</page><page sequence="20">224 Bonnie Glass-Coffin judgment (and because of the magic that had been done against her) she ran away from home with a suitor when she was sixteen years old. She described the experience as having fallen into the "Devil's temptation" and assured me that she had to "turn away from the Devil" (and to separate herself from that suitor) and do penance for many years to become suf- ficiently rehabilitated in God's eyes. It was only afterwards that she was blessed with the vision to "see" the illnesses of others and to be able to persuade them to return to a moral life in order to throw off their own illnesses.25 Flormira expressed similar ideas. In the numerous cases of sorcery that she claimed to have cured, a common thread was that of demonic temptation and the sexual transgression of the victim. Her stories were filled with allusions of necrophilia, pedophilia, incest, rape, and other "unnatural" sexual acts. She described one young victim's mother as com- plicitous in her son's experience of sorcery because of succumbing to the temptation of incubus with a demonic spirit while asleep. According to Flor, it was this act which allowed the offending spirit to possess and harm the woman's defenseless infant son. When I asked if Flor could cure the child, she said that if she were unsuccessful, the child's mother would be to blame. As suggested above, all five women in my sample accepted (even though they resented) that morality is structured differently for men than it is for women in Peruvian society. Consequently, they asserted that gender- appropriate sexual, economic, and social behavior must differ because of these differently structured morals. They recognized that society bequeaths men autonomy (and the power that accompanies autonomy) to demand service, loyalty, and obedience from their dependents. They accepted that gender-appropriate behavior emphasizes that men ought to be served, and that women ought to do the serving. And in situations where these double standards could not (or would not) be maintained, they held their patients accountable for their shortcomings. Isabel was particularly clear on these gender-structured differences, telling me on more than one occasion that this is the reality in Peru and that healing requires one to accept it and work within it rather than reject it and fight against it. To illustrate these ideas, I present a particular case history of sorcery which Isabel treated in May of i989. Jose F. and his wife, Rosa, had come to Isabel because of Jose's head- aches. During the mesa, Isabel discovered that Jose was suffering from sorcery, and that this was the reason for the headaches, as well as some significant other problems. In his mid-thirties, he still worked as a com-</page><page sequence="21">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time 225 mon laborer, in spite of relatively good access to educational opportunities and the support of his family. There were also tensions in his marriage. Rosa suspected Jose of having an affair. For his part, Jose had tired of her complaints about his mother and sisters. Isabel conducted a mesa for Jose and, while under the psychoactive influence of the San Pedro cactus, she "saw" the cause of his affliction. Ac- cording to Isabel, when Jose was seven years old someone with a grievance against Jose's father had stolen Jose's hat. Taking the hat to a sorcerer, Jose's soul had been called and commended to the "charm" of an inter- mittent waterfall. Because of this, Jose's symptoms were also intermittent. While sometimes motivated, assertive, and eager to succeed, he was at other times depressed and despondent, losing all interest and hope in his abilities. The cure required that Jose be cleansed with several of the staffs from Isabel's mesa. After the cleansings, Isabel instructed Jose to stamp on a hat that he had brought with him to the ceremony and to reassert the power to shape his own destiny. Then, Isabel told everyone at the mesa to run and stamp on the hat and to say, "That which was, was. It is in the past. Now I will make something of my life.... I go constructing my future.... They did not want me to triumph, to have my own thoughts.... But they will not win." Afterwards, Isabel admonished him, saying, "Now go and make something of your life. You're still young, study for a career." Later in the ritual Isabel focused her attention on Rosa and pressed her to describe the tensions in her relationship with her husband. Rosa admitted that there had been problems getting along with Jose's mother and his sisters. She and Jose had often fought about where his allegiance lay. Then Isabel said, Here, let's be clear, nobody is the victim of anybody else.... [Jose's mother] brought him up to be served and you, as his wife, can't change that. Do you understand? He may be your husband ... [and] you are mistress of the household ... but don't abuse [that role].... [Your husband] put on the shirt, but not the ankle-length overcoat.26 He does as he wishes.... And that is as it should be. Whatever was doesn't matter. It is what will be that matters . . . and the two of you must tighten your belts [and accept your roles.] All right? Okay, you're both cured. Thus, Isabel placed the responsibility for Jose's and Rosa's misfortune squarely on their shoulders. Jose could choose to overcome the obstacles in his life by relinquishing the resigned position of the victim. Rosa needed</page><page sequence="22">zz6 Bonnie Glass-Coffin to come to terms with her role as "good" wife and mother-even though this meant resigning herself to a double standard that gives Jose privileges and freedoms she doesn't have. In this illustration, Isabel clearly demonstrates the internalization of gender difference in socially sanctioned moral codes and behaviors. Just as Yolanda described the patient's need to undergo "spiritual rehabilitation," and Flormira blamed her patients' experiences of sorcery on the fall into "temptation," Isabel required her patients to "purify the spirit" and "come closer to God" (by accepting the realities of these gender differences and working within them) in order to be healed. As she explained the cure to Jose and Rosa, They are cleansing you ... so you will repent of all that was . . . and so destroy all which you were-the victim of a da.o.... [They are cleansing you] so that your spirit is purified, so that you are closer to God and so that the Will of God goes within you.... You will thus be made so strong that when they try to harm you [to call away your spirit in the future] they cannot. Your spirit will not be called away, because the spirit of God will fill you. According to Isabel, key components of healing include repenting of past moral transgressions, and accepting a social reality that may un- fairly privilege men but that reflects role expectations widely held by both women and men. She characterized this acceptance as "living in the Grace of God instead of in disgrace," which she defines as a rejection of life, of Being, and of the experience of living-which includes suffering as well as joy. According to Isabel, "disgrace" was defined not only as misery and disdain, but as living "apart" from life. There is an obvious paradox here. According to all the female healers that I worked with except Clorinda and Vicky, sorcery correlates with moral transgression.27 Overcoming sorcery-caused illness requires purifica- tion, penance, and redemption. For the women in my sample, this approach requires an acceptance of male privilege. This would also seem to imply ac- cepting "dependence" and resigning the hope of asserting one's autonomy in the face of systemic patriarchal oppression. But, as Isabel, Yolanda, and Flor asserted, accepting a social reality where one's autonomy is sub- lated in the context of service to others actually empowers women to find and to revalue the self. Isabel characterized this process of acceptance and "awakening" as the process of finding one's yo personal or personal-I.28 She also claimed that this acceptance moves one from a state of "emptiness" (in which one is controlled by the decision-making power of others) to a state where one has decision propia (self-determination of will). As a result,</page><page sequence="23">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time 227 one becomes empowered to think, act, and make life choices that are under one's own control. Thus, acceptance of a social reality of dependence is a first step in the road to empowerment and autonomy.29 Discussion As I have tried to show in the preceding pages, there are correspondences between women's vulnerability to sorcery (both as victims and as agents) and their resistance to socially structured inequalities. These have roots in Peru's colonial past, but have extended into the present. Specifically, women who are autonomous (economically, socially, emotionally) are con- sidered morally suspect and dangerous because morality has been defined for women as dependence on others and willingness to mute personal desire in favor of service to others (especially husbands and children). Since female identity is other-directed and overdetermined, self-worth is tied to the ability to live up to these expectations. When women can't or won't comply, the social script requires that they blame themselves (or other women) for their shortcomings. In this context, sorcery accusations serve (currently as well as in the historical past) as a way of deflecting blame and self-loathing, but also as a social control mechanism to keep women dependent, isolated, and subordinate. A good example of this can be seen in El Bosque, where the projection of blame onto the "other woman" had exactly this effect. In this environment of suspicion and mistrust, sorcery can further be understood as a way of accounting for the slippage between resistance and accommo- dation to the reality of male privilege. Its cure requires an outcome where control over identity and self-worth can be restored to women. In this setting, the female shamans described above ground healing and empowerment in the "realities" of this world. By getting their patients to come to terms with the realities of male privilege and to reclaim the moral high road, Yolanda, Isabel, and Flor empower women to revalue themselves as women, and to break the cycle of envy, jealousy, and re- venge that keeps women isolated from one another. By encouraging women to accept the morality of suffering and service as a positive component of identity and self-esteem, women can reclaim both agency and the au- tonomy of self-determination. In this way, the colonial legacy of sorcery can be subverted. These ideas correlate with feminist, postcolonial and subaltern ap- proaches to inquiry in both anthropology and theology. In anthropology, Ortner has recently called attention to the dilemma of retaining an active, intentional subject without falling into some form of free agency and</page><page sequence="24">zz8 Bonnie Glass-Coffin voluntarism when studying oppressed and marginalized populations. Her response is to focus on the "game" as the methodological unit of analy- sis rather than on either the "agent" or the "structure" of oppression. By doing so, she suggests that researchers will keep sight of the "mutual de- termination(s) of agents and structures" and of the fact that individuals can be differentially skilled at manipulating the rules of the game, even while being defined by its parameters (i996: zo). This idea is very similar to what Isabel calls "reality" and to her assertion that one can reclaim con- trol over self-definition and decision-making autonomy by first accepting the reality of gender oppression and male privilege.30 In feminist studies of the construction of religious meaning and the revaluing of the self, similar ideas obtain. According to the Peruvian feminist theologian Consuelo del Prado (i989), self-concepts inherited from men in a machista society denigrate, disempower, and undervalue women. To combat this, women need, first, to accept an identity as women. This attitude of acceptance frees women from the oppression of other-determined identities. Using Mary as a model, del Prado suggests that the process of living strengthens and empowers when individual suffering is coupled with acceptance, gratitude, love, and ser- vice/solidarity to the suffering of others. Rather than being resigned to male-imposed roles, this approach embraces as its own the role of mother, of believer, of follower, and of being a woman of the people. Del Prado calls this attitude of acceptance and thankfulness "living in Grace" (which is, again, very similar to Isabel's language). She suggests that by so accept- ing this reality, women can reclaim their identities, their self-worth, and build relationships of solidarity that come through shared suffering. This attitude is similar to what Rosemary Ruether (I993: 67) insists on for the definition of women's spirituality: "Feminist theology affirms a vision . . . of liberation and new being, but emphasizes that these must be rooted in the foundations of being and body, rather than as an antithesis of nature and spirit." And as echoed by Paula Cooey (I990: ii), Susan Wen- dell (i990: i5), and Ann Belford Ulanov (I98I: I5I-73), the awakening of agency for women living in contexts where gender inequality is structured and systemic requires prior recognition and acceptance of "what is." According to the final statement of the Latin American Conference of the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians (Buenos Aires, I985), this approach to women's spirituality is entirely in keeping with an agenda of liberation, rather than resignation to inequality. It liberates be- cause it accepts women as they are and where they are. It thus encourages self-esteem and reclaims self-worth by unifying women in their suffering rather than keeping them isolated in their self-loathing. As a positional</page><page sequence="25">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time 229 and embodied approach to spirituality, it further enhances self-esteem as it celebrates both the "God within us" and the "everydayness of life where God is made manifest." It works to refashion women's history by allowing women to act "out of their own situation, [as] symbols of struggle and re- sistance, wisdom and leadership, solidarity and fidelity, justice and peace" (Tamez i9 89: I5O -53). Conclusion In northern Peru, male shamans may measure their power in terms of their ability to dominate and transcend the dialectical oppositions represented on their mesas, but the examples presented here suggest that women do not. At least some female shamans adopt an approach to healing that grounds spiritual power in the "realities" of this world rather than em- phasizing the domination and transcendence of the everyday. They do this even while using the same symbols and participating in the same tradition of shamanic trance and "soul travel" as their male counterparts. These gender differences should not be surprising in societies of struc- tured gender inequality. But until now few studies have focused on the analysis of gender in shamanic traditions. This is surprising, since sha- manic traditions are one arena in which human meaning is constructed to both accommodate and resist social mandates. In this article, I have at- tempted to show how adding the axis of gender to studies of shamanism in Peru can provide important clues about these strategies of accommodation, resistance, and empowerment of marginalized groups. In the case of Peru, I have argued that a colonial legacy of female dependence and a socially structured and gender-specific morality influ- ences both the conceptualization of illness and the therapeutic response. Here, paradox and synthesis take an important place beside domination, contradiction, and reversal in the way female healers make sense of illness and construct their cures.32 By taking female symbol-users seriously, and by paying close attention to the multiple meanings inscribed on similar shamanic symbols, we can begin to understand how Peruvian curanderas creatively contest and construct the forces that have shaped their lives. Additionally, this understanding of how patriarchy affects female healers in contemporary Peru can be put to good use in the ongoing challenge of interpreting historical documents about female healers in the colonial era. Moreover, this article suggests a concrete, ethnographic example for what feminist theorists in anthropology and theology have long argued. Women are unlikely to find themselves-and their life experiences-re- flected in accounts which emphasize the universal as opposed to the con-</page><page sequence="26">230 Bonnie Glass-Coffin textualized, or the general as opposed to the concrete. Instead, their lives will be better reflected in accounts which celebrate the embodied (rather than nonphysical), lived-experience (rather than otherworldly), relational (rather than solitary, competitive, or adversarial), processual (rather than goal-oriented), and immanent (rather than transcendent) aspects of divinity and of daily living. The ethnographic example examined here provides a rationale for continuing to seek synthesis in feminist theory, practice, and the representation of embodied life experience in a way that empowers through presenting and affirming paradox. Whether framed in terms of objectivity/subjectivity, submission/liberation, dependence/autonomy, or structure/agency, this paradox must inform feminist theory, practice, and representation of ethnographic experience. Ortner calls this paradox the "serious game," Linda Alcoff and Teresa de Lauretis refer to it, respec- tively, as "embodied subjectivity" and "positionality" and the Peruvian curandera Isabel simply calls it "reality." In our efforts to give voice to the emergent and embodied histories that make the experience(s) of women, it is to this reality that feminist scholars must continue to attend.

Travel to these meetings was made possible because of support from the Department of Soci- ology, Social Work, and Anthropology and the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences at Utah State University (San Francisco, i996) and the Women and Gender Research Institute at Utah State University (Lima, i996). Many thanks to Monsefior Manuel Prado P6rez-Rosas and to Sefiorita Imelda Solano for opening to me the Bishopric Archives in Trujillo, Peru. To the women of El Bosque and to the healers who shared their lives with me from i987 to i989, I am deeply grate- ful. Additional thanks go to the anonymous reviewers for their sound criticisms and helpful suggestions. Assertions, interpretations, and errors in the text are, of course, of my own doing and I accept full responsibility for these. i See Comaroff i985 for a discussion of religious symbols as discourses of resis- tance in a postcolonial setting. 2 According to Mircea Eliade's classic definition of the shaman (i964), these healers would be termed shamans because of their face-to-face contact with normally unseen worlds (through entry into a kind of ecstatic trance in which body and soul are perceived to desdoblar or "split"). Alternate definitions of the term shaman extend (or specify) the definition of trance to include "pos- session" by spirit powers as well as (or instead of) soul travel (see Peters and Price-Williams i980 for a good review of definitions). In this article, I will be using Eliade's definition because soul travel rather than possession is more characteristic of the trance type utilized by Peruvian shamans.</page><page sequence="27">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time 23I 3 As discussed below and elsewhere (Glass-Coffin i992, i998; Joralemon and Sharon I993; Skillman i990), sorcery is a socially relevant illness in urban and periurban Peru, in both the colonial past and the postcolonial present. Char- acterized by symptoms ranging from somatic malaise and domestic strife to economic hardship, sorcery is here defined as intentional harm, enacted upon a victim by a close relative, business associate, or friend, through the interven- tion of a sorcerer. To effect the sorcery, the sorcerer uses his relationship with spirit entities to enact the harm, by calling the victim's soul away from his or her body and commending it to the spirit entity, who imprisons the victim's soul and keeps it from returning to the body. The effects of the sorcery may be transferred, directly or indirectly, to the victim, after the sorcerer has worked his or her magic. When transference is direct, it is through contagion (via inges- tion of a magically "poisoned" substance that is mixed with the victim's food or via physical contact with an object which has been so "poisoned"). When transference is indirect, it is through sympathetic magic (via actions done to a likeness of the victim or to an object belonging to the victim). 4 See Earls and Silverblatt I976 for their representation of Pachacuti Yamqui's famous drawing for a visual portrayal of these dualisms as well as for a dis- cussion of gender complementarity of these. For discussion of the pantheon of deities worshipped by indigenous peoples at the time of the Spanish conquest, see Duviols i986, Arriaga i968, and Valcarcel n.d. 5 Excellent summaries of the tasks of huaca guardians can be found in Mills I997: 38-74. In his subsequent chapter on Chancas and Conopas, Mills ex- tends the analysis to a discussion of lineage gods (chancas) and personal gods of fecundity (conopas) and suggests that the "girl of rare beauty" Arriaga recounts as having been consecrated to the huaca of Conchucos (and presented in the text, below) was actually a Chanca guardian (Mills I997: 75). Whether women were relegated to guardianship of "lesser" deities (like earth-related deities) or were recognized as guardians and priestesses of the more "important" deities also has been the subject of some debate, at least in part because of the gender bias of chroniclers as to which categories of religious worship were important (see Silverblatt i987, Rostworowski i988, Glass-Coffin i998: 37-42, Griffiths i996, and Mills I997 for discussion). 6 These ideas infuse Peruvian folklore as well. For examples, see Karlin I97I: 73 and Le6n Barandaridn I938: I95-z00. 7 Not surprisingly, I was not able to establish the rapport and trust necessary for research with women who had been pointed out to me as "witches." From sat- isfied patients and intimate friends, I had referrals to each of the eight women who admitted being healers and who eventually agreed to work with me. The many other women that I attempted to approach on my own after hearing rumors of their involvement in healing (or of their reputation as "brujas") all denied their participation in such practices or simply refused to see me. The fact that it took me five months to locate any women who would agree to talk with me (in spite of my extensive contacts with both male healers and their patients developed as a result of previous research on traditional healing in northern Peru) suggests to me that female healers were deeply concerned about the popular perception that women are especially prone to commit acts of evil and about the perception that those women who had some expertise in "magical" realms would use it to provoke harm rather than to heal.</page><page sequence="28">232 Bonnie Glass-Coffin 8 Unless otherwise noted, all translations of Spanish sources are my own. 9 Porquerias, literally "pig dung," refers generically to objects used for doing evil magic. io This tendency exists in sharp contrast to the late-colonial Mexican cases sum- marized by Ruth Behar (i987), where the accused tended to come forward themselves. II In the cases brought against the women summarized above, accusers included public officials like provincial magistrates and town mayors (AAT I77ia, I77Ic, I774b), other Indians who approached their parish priests with these accu- sations in order to "clear their consciences" (AAT I774a), previously named defendants who attempted to clear their names from previous accusation by neighbors (AAT I778, i809) and even an adoptive daughter who was acting under pressure from her husband's aunt because of longtime enmity between the aunt and the accused (AAT I786). Interestingly, in the cases brought against the male healers (where an emphasis on European dogma about witchcraft and devil worship is superseded by an interest in documenting the local forms of heterodox religious practice) it was at least as common for healers to be denounced by ecclesiastic officials as by indigenous neighbors or other public officials (AAT I77ib, i8oo, 1804, 18I3, and i8I7 were cases brought by ecclesi- astic officials; AAT I752, I768, and i824, by neighbors, townspeople, or other public officials). iz See Stern I995 for a splendid discussion of gender politics and morality in late colonial Mexico as well as an analysis of how women contested patriarchy, not through open opposition to first principles of structured gender inequality but rather through formation and cultivation of female networks of allies, through threats of making male abuse of power public via scandal, and through appeals to supernatural retribution for justice in situations of abuse (I995: 299-300). I3 See Mannarelli i985 for a similar analysis of women accused of witchcraft in seventeenth-century cases brought before the Lima Tribunal of the Holy In- quisition. Note also that in Mexico, as in Peru, "the figure of the independent female or loner could draw a special cultural stigma. Symbolically at least, the woman who escaped direct, personal patriarchal vigilance might subvert gender order and morality" (Stern I995: 299). I4 See Glass-Coffin i998 for a discussion. See also Perrone, Stockel and Krueger i989: I77-83 for a discussion of similar themes among contemporary Hispanic curanderas in the southwestern United States. I5 See Glass-Coffin i992 and i998, Sharon I978, and Joralemon and Sharon I993 for elaboration of this idea. I6 All of the names of the El Bosque women interviewed are pseudonyms. I7 See Leacock and Etienne I980, Bossen I979, French I986, and Mohanty, Russo and Torres I99I for general discussions of the ways in which colonial encoun- ters have structured gender inequality around the world and in Latin America. See Behar I993 for a close look at the effects of gender inequality on one Mexican woman's life. I8 Cooey (I990: II) defines heteronomy as "the role played by otherness in the formation of the concept 'woman."' I9 See Melhus I993: 40 for a discussion of suffering as an essential female virtue and as part of female identity in Mexico (and by extension in other machista societies of Latin America). Melhus further argues that morality is constructed</page><page sequence="29">Engendering Peruvian Shamanism through Time differently for males and females in contemporary Latin America. She asserts that there is a close relationship between suffering and female morality (which requires sexual purity, chastity, and sacrifice of one's own desires and needs for the sake of one's children), as well as a close relationship between morality and identity for Latin American females. zo One frequently cited source of this "temptation" is the demonic pact. Among the healers in my study there was a firm belief in the relationship between soul loss (as the proximate cause of the daho from which a victim suffers) and the act of trading one's soul to the Devil in a kind of Faustian pact in exchange for riches, power, and selfishness (all perceived as antisocial behaviors that were not in keeping with a woman's moral obligations to husband, children, and community). This entry into a demonic pact could be voluntary or involuntary, as when a sorcerer orchestrated the "trade" on behalf of the unwitting victim. But the consequences were still the same -the victim of sorcery engages in anti- social or sexually immoral behavior. This relationship between sorcery, soul loss, and the Faustian pact is a common theme of historic and contemporary cases of sorcery in northern Peru (see Glass-Coffin [in press] for discussion). See also Perrone, Stockel, and Krueger i989: I77-83 for a similar discussion of Hispanic "bewitchment" in the American Southwest. zi See Glass-Coffin i992 and Joralemon and Sharon I993 for discussion. zz See also Joralemon i983, i984, i985; Joralemon and Sharon I993; Polia i988. 23 Fieldwork with these five women was conducted between April i988 and Sep- tember i989 in the coastal and mountain regions of Lambayeque, Cajamarca, and Piura in northern Peru. 24 This difference between Clorinda and Vicky and the other healers in my sample may be related to the fact that both apprenticed to male healers (and probably internalized their healing philosophies). It may also be a product of my brief association with these two women, compared with the other women in my sample and the consequent lack of data on the subject. 25 This refers to the psychic or "magical" vision of otherworldly events that is the hallmark of Peruvian shamanism. 26 "El se visti6 a su camisa pero no el saco hasta los talones." This is a veiled reference to the epithet saco largo, which translates loosely as "henpecked" or more literally as "long scrotum." Saco translates as both overcoat and scrotum in the colloquial Spanish of this region. 27 Even Clorinda noted that "weakness" and "strength" were correlated with sexual activity and purity, respectively. The likelihood of succumbing to an at- tack of sorcery was inversely related to the healer's power and autonomy. And Vicky's emphasis on love magic and sorcery as the manipulation of desire is also suggestive of similar ideas. 28 While key components of this philosophy were clearly apparent in my conversa- tions with Isabel, Flor, and Yolanda, Isabel's rendering of this phenomenology of healing was the most explicit of the three. This may in part be due to my extended period of fieldwork with her. In the course of eleven months, we had many more opportunities to explore these topics than were possible in the three months I spent with Flor and the six weeks I spent with Yolanda. 29 Isabel entreated her patients to accept the experience of living, with all the suffering that this implies. In fact, for Isabel and all the healers in my sample, suffering was a key component to accepting what it means to be a woman.</page><page sequence="30">234 Bonnie Glass-Coffin This suffering was rooted in the acceptance of moral obligations that require women to serve others instead of focusing on their own needs. See Melhus I993 for a similar analysis of suffering, purity, and women's morality in Mexico. See Behar i993: 275-302 and especially 296 for a discussion of the paradox of acceptance/empowerment as it applies to "Esperanza," the poor Mexican woman who is the focus of Translated Woman. 30 In the words of other authors who have wrestled with this dilemma, this focus on the context of interaction between agency and structure is a way to "posi- tion" or "embody" the analysis of women's experience of oppression and to understand gendered subjectivity as "an emergent property of a historicized ex- perience" (de Lauretis I993: 84) or as "positionality within a context" (Alcoff I994: II7). An advantage of "positioning" women's subjectivity within a socio- historical context is that scholars can be sensitive to, and become aware of, how women actively interpret values and construct meaning, utilizing their positions to their advantage, even while unable to transcend oppressive contexts. 31 According to Isabel, acceptance of "reality" or living "in the Grace of God" leads to an awareness of "God within." Conversely, rejection of reality means a rejection of the God within and correlates with a lack of self-esteem. In the final statement of the Latin American conference summarized here, it is this awareness of God within that "draws us women out of our own lack of self- esteem and out of the oppression we experience because of our gender" (Tamez i989: I5I). This approach is very much in keeping with Valerie Saiving's (i960) insistence that the greatest sin against God is not that of pride but of a lack of self-esteem. 32 See Bynum i986: I5 for similar assertions about the different ways that male and female symbol users construct meaning.
