PLUMPE Josephinum College, Worthington, Ohio One of the most recent and most successful attempts to account for the ascendancy and supremacy of ancient Rome was presented by Richard Heinze (t1929) in his famous inaugural address as president of the University of Leipzig.2 Historians from Polybius to Mommsen had endeavored to solve the problem by stressing this or that unique Roman institution. Others, following the ex- ample of the philosopher Posidonius, had emphasized certain moral qualities of the people-the Romani mores antiqui. But Heinze chose to be routed over ways paved by the modern psy- chology of personality and to seek the ultimate explanation for Roman greatness "in the whole structure of the Roman soul." For the purpose of this paper it is important to refer to a note- worthy means of inquiry Heinze recommended by way of intro- duction to his psychological approach: the judicious "reading" of a Latin lexicon.3 Many words and expressions, properly of a moral, religious, or political coinage, need only to be seen apart from the faded and changed signification they convey in our modern- language vocabularies, and understood in their full original sense, to serve as invaluable testimonials for the thinking and ways of even those early Romans of whom we have neither written nor traditionary record that is reliable. His famous articles on auc- 1 Read in part at the seventeenth annual meeting of the Ohio Classical Confer- ence, Columbus, Oct. 28, 1938. 2 Von den Ursachen der Griisse Roms4 (address delivered Oct. 31, 1921): Leipzig, Teubner (1934). 3 Cf. op. cit., 5 f.; 9: Ein unschitzbares Hilfsmittel ist das lateinische Lexikon, wenn man es recht zu lesen weiss. 275</page><page sequence="2">276 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL toritas and fides4 illustrate what he had in mind. But these words are only two of a large number of Latin abstracts, the proper understanding and rendering of which forever disconcert the Latin student and scholar as well-"Roman character-words" they have been quite appositely called.5 Obviously such words abound in the speeches of Cicero. If to illustrate our point the panegyric on the Martian legion in the Fourteenth Philippic (29-35) has been chosen, it is for these two reasons: First, the selection is a speech in itself, a brief compact unit of not more than two and one-half pages of Oxford text. Secondly: though the entire rhetoric and the technical structure of a Ciceronian oration quite evidently are Greek, the subject matter hardly ever owes to actual borrowings from Greek ora- tory.6 Only the little laudatio legionis Martiae, exposed as it was to an intensive investigation of the Athenian funeral addresses, the so-called rLWraT&amp;Lot Xb'yot, failed to escape a tagging and citation. Passages in it supposedly have been taken by Cicero from the ic7rdqLtot of Pseudo-Lysias, Pseudo-Demosthenes, Pericles as re- ported by Thucydides, and from the Menexenus of Plato.7 It will be to our purpose to consider some of the characteristically Roman elements that even it contains. To state the situation briefly: Cicero spoke the Fourteenth and last extant Philippic in the Senate on the 21st of April, 43, after a report had reached the capital that Antony had been defeated (April 15th) in the second of two engagements on the Via Aemilia near Forum Gallorum. Cicero vigorously supports the motion of P. Servilius calling for a supplicatio. But arguing that this would 4 In Hermes LX (1925), 348-366 and LXIv (1929), 140-166.

He concludes with a eulogy for the Martian legionaries, most of whom had perished at Forum Gallorum. The opening sentence reads: Est autem fidei pietatisque nostrae declarare fortissimis militibus quam memores simus quamque grati: "But now it is the part of our fides and pietas to show our valiant fides soldiers how gratefully we remember them." The wordfides at once confronts us with a directive of Roman life and society as im- portant as it is difficult to understand. This is made strikingly evi- dent when we study the thirty long columns the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae gives it. Consulting Harper's Latin Dictionary, s.v., we find these first general equivalents for fides: "trust in a person or thing, faith, confidence, reliance, credence, belief." E. Fraenkel's article ap- pearing in the Thesaurus and the observations later published by him8 show conclusively that the trust-belief compass of meanings is of comparatively recent date, first occurring in the Auctor ad Herennium and in Cicero's De Inventione. The dictionaries reflect an over-zealous attempt to find in oldest Latinity what had been regarded as originating with Christianity. The second group of meanings in Harper's, called transferred meanings, to wit: "the quality that produces confidence in a person, trustworthiness, faithfulness, conscientiousness, credibility, honesty," corresponds to what Fraenkel finds as the regular range of signification during the republican era. Here Heinze enters, showing from a study of Latin texts and Roman institutions that fides is practically an amalgam of corre- sponding elements in the two series of meanings quoted. It is neither solely an actio fidendi, credendi, etc., nor is it solely a causa fidendi, credendi. It invariably carries a dual implication, it is bi-polar, requiring at least two persons: alicui fides est 1I apud aliquem (Heinze 28). Fides therefore-to take one of the English equivalents given above-is not "confidence," but a "relation- ship of confidence," Vertrauensverhdltnis, as Heinze puts it (27). 8 "Zur Geschichte des Wortes Fides," in Rhein. Mus. lxx (1916), 187-199.</page><page sequence="4">278 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Similarly, there is no fides which is purely subjective reliance or trust, nofides which is wholly objective reliabilityor trustworthiness. To illustrate by the word last mentioned, "trustworthiness": Heinze shows very clearly (38) that there is no trustworthiness unless it be recognized trustworthiness. A person owes its presence to something in his personality that is seen by others; and the degree of trustworthiness depends on how it is measured by others. Thus fides becomes a very real possession, as is particularly ap- parent from Plautus, who frequently pairs it in the sense of "credit" with res, "property," genus, "family, stock," etc. In his article on auctoritas Heinze has demonstrated how deeply ingrained in Roman character it was to seek advice in all situations from those qualified to give it, called auctores. The partfides played in Roman private and public life becomes evident if we consider a typically Roman institution such as clientela, "clientage." Indi- viduals as well as whole communities and territories gave their interests in trust to a man of influence, the patronus. A similar relationship of fides existed between the magistrates and their subjects.9 Now, the Fourteenth Philippic is spoken in the Senate. The fides pietasque nostra at the beginning of the eulogy is fides pietasque senatus. The members of the Senate were for the greatest part ex- magistrates, men who had held curule offices or the tribuneship, men therefore who defacto owed their senatorial office to the ballot, the suffragium populi. To this populus Romanus they were bound by the highest kind offides. In their exercise of Roman government and determination of Roman policies they were furthering the res publica, the res populi entrusted to them, to their fides; and from these considerations too, it would seem, new light is shed upon the formulary phrase senatus populusque Romanus.'o 9 Heinze, "Fides," 39-41; 47-50; 54 f.

A state of civil turmoil, a tumultus, had been declared early in February, 43. The soldiers of the Martian legion, all but wiped out in the first engage- ment at Forum Gallorum, and those of the fourth legion, who had fought at the second, had offered their lives to save the patria, senatoribus fideicommissa. It had been to the best interests of this fideicommissum for the Senate to promise rewards to veterans and recruits who took up arms for the loyalist cause; and it was equally incumbent upon senatus fides-the phrase so occurs in ??30 and 35-to redeem these promises, to show quam memores simus, as Cicero words it. To show quamque grati simus was ordained by pietas senatus. pietas But pietas binds every member of the Roman societas civium. It is interesting to note how in the few paragraphs under consideration, besides the Senate, all the other dramatis personae are so involved: Apostrophizing the fallen legionaries in ?32, he refers to those whom they had slain as impii, punished ad inferos, while they themselves (distinguished by summa militum pietas: 6) have at- tained to the piorum sedes et locus. In ?35 it is stated that the monument proposed will bear testimony of populi Romani pietas. And then there is Antony, guilty of the basest crime against pietas, the crime of parricidium, the murder of free Roman citizens, and treason (35).11 This is true Roman piety: Pium esse estfilium esse, "to be pious is to be a son," fromm sein heisst Sohn sein, as a modern poet and thinker states in a chapter on Vergil's pius Aeneas;"2 and Roman pietas in its highest form is patriae filium esse. The sentence in the First Catilinarian (17) comes to mind: Patria ... communis est parens omnium nostrum; and it is little wonder that in one of Cicero's definitions of pietas the patria precedes even the parentes, as the objects of pietas are enumerated.'3 For the Roman there was no pietas if not manifested externally. There was no piety wholly resident in the inner man. Pietas erga 1' On civium parricidium cf. Cicero, In Cat. I, 29; patriae parricidium, Cic., Phil. n, 17; xi, 29.

So it is for pietas senatus populique Romani to show gratitude to the Martian legion outwardly. They must show oficium et diligens cultus, as is owing to all objects of pietas-to quote from a second definition by Cicero." The cultus due the soldiers, both the fallen and the survivors, is honos provided by honos. Cicero states (29): Aequum est . .. . militum . . . honorem coniungi: "It is but fair that a public recognition for our soldiers be added" (to that recommended for their generals). What is honos (honor)? In English perhaps oftener than not the word signifies something received and possessed, rather than manifested and given. For the Roman-and this is as true for Cicero as for Plautus-the dual meaning of the word gives pre- ponderance to agency: it nearly always stresses activity, action in favor of another. It is honoring. Its verbal nature is clearly recog- nized from the frequent phrase, practically belonging to Latin formulary language, honorem habere. This does not mean to possess honor or to be honored, but to posit an act of recognition, to accord recognition; and even the phrase, in honore esse, to all appearances connoting a purely static condition, conveys the idea of action when the dative of the doer is added.'1 Again, as was shown above, pietas is expressed by cultus: this action-noun and the verb colere, it is pertinent to add, repeatedly occur in conjunction with honos.J" Cicero defines honos as praemium virtutis iudicio studioque civium delatum ad aliquem.Y7 The predominantly active or effective force of the word is at once seen from the definition. That it is an actio civium is also important. That honos is usually vested with a public or political tenor, registering recognition by the cives, populus, senatus-by the societas Romana, collectively or vicari- ously-of well-exercised citizenship is not surprising when we have noted what fides and pietas bespeak for the feeling and outlook of the Romans toward their commonwealth. 14 De Inv. 1, 161. Cf. Haecker, op. cit., 80 f. 15 Cf. F. Klose, Die Bedeutung von honos und honestus (diss. Breslau): Ohlau, Eschen- hagen (1933), 13-15; 22 f.; 53 f.

As for the fallen, facile est bene agere cum eis ... (30). Quorum de honore utinam ... plura in mentem venirent! Duo certe non prae- teribo . .. : quorum alterum pertinet ad virorum fortissimorum glo- riam sempiternam, etc. (31). Here we meet another Roman character-word, gloria. It has gloria been said that a dual connotation, stressing agency, is much less evident in gloria than in honos; that the former is a permanent possession and that all it implies centers upon the subject and its personal claim or title to it.18 But it seems that in an effort to establish a marked cleavage of meaning these differences have been overemphasized. Gloria, as frequently defined by Cicero and as has been pointed out before,'9 conveys the same emphasis of glorification as an expression of active esteem, as honos is expressive of an honoring. The following definitions, taken from both ends of Cicero's literary estate, illustrate this: Gloria est frequens de aliquo fama cum laude; and it is laus recte factorum magnorumque in rem publicamfama meritorum, quae cum optimi cuiusque, tum etiam multitudinis testimonio comprobatur.20 The prevailing import of actual judgment and recognition (laus ... testimonio comprobatur) by the state-society for a deserving member of that society should be evident.21 But its bestowal by all the citizens (optimi cuiusque, tum etiam multitudinis) for great public services rendered (mag- norumque in rem publicam meritorum), elevates it above honos. A third distinguishing mark is brought out by Cicero in the sentence (31) that introduced the concept under discussion: gloria is a permanent gift, lasting beyond death (ad virorum . . gloriam sempiternam). In one of his many reviews of his consular year he 18 Thus Klose, op. cit., 15 f.; 25; 44 f. 19 By U.

Disp. im, 3; De Off. 11, 31; Pro Marc. 26. 21 Knoche (loc. cit., 103) makes these very interesting observations: Before the Christian era there is in Roman literature only one instance of gloria deorum; and there (Ovid, Met. I, 465) it can be resolved into an anthropomorphism. Again, up to the second century after Christ no Roman woman received gloria. The gods were not subject to judgment by the societas Romana; in the case of woman, such judgment was the prerogative of her husband.</page><page sequence="8">282 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL asks: Nesciebam vitae brevem esse cursum, gloriam sempiternam?22 Here we are at the source of Cicero's burning ambition. Here was his immortality, though only in part; for, as we shall see, he was too Roman to strive after nothing more than an exalted aloneness among Roman posterity and among men of aftertime. To look back and briefly correlate the concepts thus far ex- amined, adding a word on others incidentally mentioned: Honos merita is a public recognition for merita, public services performed. When extraordinary merita are accorded universal recognition with per- manence assured, gloria results. Merita are, however, engendered by virtus, and recognition for it is the ultimate object of honos and gloria. Honos may come to the ordinary vir bonus and to the vir magnus; and if honos be given concrete expression, the honores- for example, the various magistracies-will be correspondingly great. But gloria is the portion of the vir magnus only.23 Seen from the utilitarian do-ut-des standpoint-and this aspect of Roman nature is ever present, but should not be stressed to the praemia point of overlooking others-both honos and gloria are praemia virtutis, rewards, recompenses.24 The interesting distinction has been recorded that when in the military sphere praemia and honores are mentioned together, the former designate material re- wards to soldiers (e.g., bounties, land), the latter, ambition's prizes to officers and generals (e.g., promotion, triumph).25 An earlier Philippic, the Fifth, illustrates this well (4; 35-54); but it is also found in the Fourteenth: special honores for the generals-Hirtius, Pansa, and the young Caesar-and renewed promises of praemia for the soldiers are asked. The granting of the latter-and this returns us to the panegyric-is dictated by fides (29: Est autem fidei . . . nostrae; 30: quibus senatus fides praestabitur) to the living. Cicero would have this same fides shown to the fallen soldiers too by paying out the praemia promised them to their surviving rela- tives (35). But he would also give them honos, a honos so great 2 Pro Sest. 47; cf. ibid. 143; In Cat.

And here the Republic, now really in its death-struggle, expresses its pietas for heroes who had died victims of their own pietas for the patria and sustains Cicero's appeal. Monumentum fieri quam amplissimum, is the honos and cultus pietatis that Cicero asks for the slain legionaries (31). That he wishes this monument to be quam amplissimum tempts one to see in this another instance of Roman ethos revealed; for it can be pointed out that amplus is actually a space-word, meaning in the amplitudo first place: great, large, wide, extensive, ample, spacious. It con- veys the idea of size and bulk. Somewhat later (33) the monument is envisioned as exstructa moles opere magnifico. The dictionary will yield a size-and-bulk interpretation of these words too; though undoubtedly Cicero's colleagues in the Senate understood him as advocating "the erection of a great monument of magnificent workmanship." It is true, the orator does not expressly say that he wishes the monument to be beautiful and artistic in design and execution; and elsewhere in the Philippics, even in cases of pro- posals properly calling for plastic art, scarcely any aesthetic con- sideration is discoverable.2 Nor is a search of the Greek funeral orations for an illustration of the national antithesis made wholly in vain: Cicero's moles opere magnifico may well be contrasted with Plato's TaO' KaX7 7~ Kal /CEyaXorpers.127 But the truisim of the realistic and prosy natures of the Romans, as prosy and rustic as the names they bore, has been sub iudice often enough."2 Here it suffices to have indicated that the Roman ieiunitas bonarum artium29 is documented in a measure even in the last oration of Cicero. 26 In v, 41 he asks for a statua equestris inaurata to honor M. Lepidus; in ix, 13 and 16, for a statua pedestris aenea in memory of Ser. Sulpicius. 27 Menex. 234C. In Rome's heroic, prehistoric time bulk and size distinguish the tomb of the hero: that of Misenus is ingenti mole sepulcrum (Vergil, Aen. vI, 232), that of Dercennus, ingens . .. bustum (ibid. xI, 849 f.). 28 Cf., for example, G. Showerman, "Cicero's Appreciation of Greek Art," in Am. Jour. Phil. xxv (1904), 306-314; A. Besangon, Les adversaires de l'Hellenisme d Rome pendant la periode republicaine: Paris, Alcan (1910), 294-304; etc. 29 The words are Cicero's: De Or. II, 10.</page><page sequence="10">284 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL It will be eminently wise senatorial policy to provide for the monument as a concrete expression of Rome's gratitude to the heroes of Forum Gallorum. Cicero states in ?30: Maxime... proprium senatus sapientis est, grata eorum virtutem memoria prose- qui, qui pro patria vitam profuderunt. sapientia Of course, this sapientia has little or nothing in common with the prudentia abstract ao~oa of the Greeks. Most often, and that holds too for those portions in Cicero's philosophical works in which he does some Roman thinking of his own, sapientia is practically identical with prudentia, providentia, providere. Thus he states in the Hortensius (frg. 33M) : Id enim est sapientis, providere; ex quo sapientia est ap- pellata prudentia. Again, in De Rep. I, 45: Sapientis est... pro- spicere. Similarly, De Off. I, 153. This idea of foreseeing the future and making corresponding provision certainly is the implication of senatus sapientis est... virtutem memoria prosequi. Roman prudentia, i.e. Roman praevidere and providere, was the very basis and prerequisite of Roman auctoritas. That by which Rome's destinies were directed more than by anything else, senatus auctoritas, presupposed senatus prudentia; and shaping the life of every Roman was maiorum auctoritas, derived from their prudentia and sapientia, as fre- quently exemplified by Cicero's pointing out momentous matters that the ancestors had foreseen and provided for. Quite evidently for Cicero this prudentia or sapientia is not to be identified with any extraordinary gift of prognostication. It comes from well-marked experience (usus) and circumspection (consilium). In De Inv. II, 160 Cicero expatiates on prudentia as containing three elements: memoria, intelligentia, and providentia. The first of these is per quam animus repetit illa quae fuerunt; the second, per quam ea perspicit quae sunt; and the third, per quam futurum aliquid videtur ante quam factum sit. Hence prudentia en- compasses the past, present, and future. This, to my mind-and the digression finds its excuse in Cicero's proposal for the future- is typical of the triple countenance which life in the Roman family and in the larger family of the state often reveals to our scrutiny. The Romans of Cicero's day still live, or pretend to live, more maiorum. They live again the past in the present, with their fore-</page><page sequence="11">ROMAN ELEMENTS IN CICERO'S PANEGYRIC 285 bears. But Roman living is also determined by the future, by future Romans. Forever conscious of being maiorum posteri, they never forget that they themselves, the living, are posterorum maiores. And this consciousness does not beget a mere attitude or sentiment, an esteem for the past, the iZrawop and E'rtIELLts r'ov rpoyb6vco of the Greeks, and the wistful wish to be remembered after death; but it is a consciousness of a sacred duty to be per- formed toward those who made Rome in the past, and toward those who will bear Rome's destiny and name in the future. This is, in largest measure, the Roman idea and instinct of immortality, Cicero's praesentire, prospicere in futurum.30 This communion of the living, the dead, and those yet in the womb of Roma aeterna, and the immortality it effects, are well brought out as Cicero continues in ?33: Actum igitur praeclare vobiscum, fortissimi dum vixistis, nunc vero etiam sanctissimi milites, quod vestra virtus neque oblivione eorum qui nunc sunt nec reticentia posterorum sepulta esse poterit. That which will assure the departed heroes an abiding presence among their own now and in the future is their virtus. This-to virtus state a very patent truth-is involved and aspects of it appear in every discussion of Romanitas. Thus, much has been said about virtus, but the book-scarcely a doctoral dissertation-on what it is, remains to be written. The Romans of the republican times were scarcely aware of it as a comprehensive ethical concept. In this sense virtus is the philosopher's surrogate for ipE T. The virtus we are concerned with-mentioned nine times in the eulogy-is one of a number of virtutes and above all others the Roman na- tional virtue: manliness, courage, bravery-fortitudo.31 In the 30 Compare Cicero's panegyric ?32 with Pro Rab. perd. 29 f.; Pro Arch. 29; Pro Sest. 143; Pro.

Heinze, Vom Geist des Rilmertums, 279 (lecture notes reported by Burck):</page><page sequence="12">286 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL passage quoted above from ?33 Cicero himself interprets it as such: "Actum igitur praeclare vobiscum, fortissimi, . . . quod ves- tra virtus ... " Virtus Romana was a man's virtue; it marked him, whether he wore the sagum or the toga, with a soldier's mettle. I know of no better statement on its nature and the people it animated than that Heinze once made in a classical conference. The following translation, it is hoped, does justice to the original formulation: "What in Greece was class virtue of the nobility, at the time when ipE~r7 was little evolved beyond the meaning of bravery-this was, and remained, a citizen's virtue at Rome, at least for the duration of the Republic.""32 Finally, in the last paragraph (35), Cicero states that but for the heroism of the legionaries at Forum Gallorum the nomen populi Romani would have been extinguished by the parricide of Antony. nomen This nomen populi Romani is of very frequent concern to Cicero. A populi profounder significance attaches to the word than is suggested by Romani "name," "illustrious name," "fame," "reputation," etc., of the Ro- man people. It seems that its provenience should be sought in nomen gentis. As is known, in Roman nomenclature nomen or nomen gentis [n. generis, gentile, gentilicium] was the equivalent of a per- son's middle name, indicating his origin by gens, or clan. Some- times nomen familiae stands for the same, rather than for the cognomen. Besides being used alone for gens as well as familia, nomen can also have the more general meaning of race, stock, or people. An investigation, therefore, into Cicero's usage of the phrase nomen populi Romani-and none has been made to the writer's knowledge-should take into account every occurrence of the word in his writings.33 An incomplete inquiry suggests these preliminary observations: The expression nomen populi Romani apparently indicates the transfer of something proper to the clan and family to the highest Diejenige moralische Eigenschaft, die die grisste Expansionsfaihigkeit gezeigt hat, ist virtus, die Mannhaftigkeit, die soldatische Bewdhrung (latter italics mine). - Vom Geiste des Romertums, 280. A paraphrase is given by H. Roloff in a recent review of the book just mentioned, in Glttingischze Gelehrte Anzeigen ccI (1939), 97 f. 33 Related phrases found frequently: nomen Romanum, n. rei publicae, n. imperii.</page><page sequence="13">ROMAN ELEMENTS IN CICERO'S PANEGYRIC 287 form of society, the res publica. It indicates the injection of another personal, ethical note into the state-citizen relationship. The note lies on the surface in many passages: the nomen populi Romani is most sacred and dear, it is violated and contaminated, it is sold into bondage, etc. In the case under consideration Cicero states that the name would have been destroyed: parricidio M. Antoni nomen populi Romani occidisset. One seems justified in linking such a thought and the patriotic sentiment from which it springs, here and elsewhere in Cicero, with the following historical aspect of Roman nomenclature: When in republican times and even later a patrician was found guilty of high treason, his condemnation in- cluded a damnatio memoriae. For the future no member of his gens was permitted to bear his praenomen. In the words of Gellius, the praenomina of men so condemned were meant to be defamata atque demortua cum ipsis."4 We know of two celebrated cases of such procedure. The one, a stock example mentioned by Cicero in his first invective against Antony (32), concerns M. Manlius Capitolinus, executed as a revolutionary in 384. Under Augustus the same praenomen "Mar- cus" was proscribed for the Antonii when the senate decreed a damnatio memoriae for the hostis patriae iudicatus, Mark Antony. Later Caligula forced Cn. Pompeius Magnus to drop his cog- nomen.5 But there is no record of a nomen gentis ever having been thus extirpated, which "would have meant the extinction of the gens."36 There was no more anxious concern of the Romans than to prevent such extinction. The precautions taken to assure the con- tinuance of the nomen gentis and the nomen familiae-adoption, for example, in all its complicated forms-are ever in evidence." This attitude is reproduced in the Roman's conduct toward the state, whose welfare and continued existence he idealizes and to a SNoctes Atticae Ix, 12, 11. 11 Cf.

Instructive, too, is this point of view: The Roman dominion of Cicero's day was far greater in extent than that of the Italian Empire to-day. Yet, it was never called Italia or Italia Magna or Imperium Italicum, but Roma it remained. A very isolated Rome it had been from its arduous first days on the Palatine; aloof it chose to stand even after its treaty with the Latin cities; and as it marched from the unification of Italy to the conquest and absorption of the world, it never sacrificed or shared one whit of its own individuality. It did not tolerate the shadow of an altera Roma, and the charge, for example, of planning to establish one at Capua contributed to the doom of the agrarian bill in the year 63. Significantly enough Cicero calls hanc Romam, not Italy, communem patriam omnium nostrum."3 For those who lived outside the pomerium of Rome-the inhabitants of the municipia, the Latin colonists, the Italian allies, the provincials-the nomen populi Romani was the very essence of Rome,39 pervading the lives of them all; and thus, in the happy phrasing of Montesquieu, though not of the same country, they were all Romans: Sans &amp;tre compatriotes, ils etaient tous Romains.40 And again, just as the Roman gens sought to perpetuate itself and the ius imaginum, and the nomen gentis gave expression to this desire, so also the nomen populi Romani brought out for both citizen and subject the wish for Roma sempiterna, the diuturnitas imperii, forever in the mind and mouth of Cicero. In the foregoing paragraphs I have attempted to recognize and sketch the chief elements of Romanitas pulsating through a speech of scarcely three chapters within a larger Ciceronian speech. If we classicists are told to-day that an ague is upon us which no Iliad iv will cure, if it is dinned into our ears that we must die 8 Cf. Cicero, Leg. Agr. II, 86-89; and J. Vogt, op. cit., 94. 9 This is similarly expressed by J. Vogt, ibid. More recently H. Fuchs, in Der geistige Widerstand gegen Rom in der antiken Welt: Berlin, de Gruyter (1938), 1 [I quote from the review by E. Hohl in Phil. Wochenschrift Lx (1940), 37], has described Rome as the Inbegriff (essence), sichtbare Verkdrferung (visible embodiment), und Sinnbild (symbol) of the entire empire. 40 Grandeur et Decadence des Romains*: Paris, Libraire Hachette (1906), 76.</page><page sequence="15">ROMAN ELEMENTS IN CICERO'S PANEGYRIC 289 unless we prove the classics sufficiently responsive to social and economic objectives, is it not really eminently within our heritage of humanistic value to meet this challenge? Individual (individuus), community (communitas), society (societas), citizenship (civitas)- does not the state exist and thrive by these very qualities-ab- stractions we call them-even as it does by all the concrete things that you may ask your students of Latin to identify and recon- struct from Roman living? Of course the understanding and as- similation of these concepts and values by the instructor and the imparting of them to the pupil are two very different things. But a communicatio utilitatum is involved that is well worth the hard work it takes.</page></plain_text>
