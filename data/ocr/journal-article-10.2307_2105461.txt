<plain_text><page sequence="1">Naturalismo e Ipotesi Metafisica. GIovANNI Di CRESCENZO. Napoli: Edizioni Scientifiche Italiane, 1962. Pp. 224. There is much that is excellent in the work of Mr. Di Crescenzo: some very sensitive and instructive comment, for example, on "Nature as Experience" and some other elements that enter into the obscure fabric</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 605 of Dewey's logic and aesthetics; a refined and subtle capacity for the sort of abstract argument that reduces its opponents to self-contradiction; and some highly interesting phenomenological description of the "pure sen- sation" in which "man lives and feels the metaphysical relativity of perception in itself in reference to a larger horizon which is no longer mere nature but the whole." It is this pure perception which becomes the basis for Mr. Di Crescenzo's metaphysics as hypothesis. A sincere appreciation of Mr. Di Crescenzo's excellent philosophical capabilities makes one regret that one cannot enter more cordially into the style of metaphysical thought that he proposes. In part this is certainly due to the fact that the philosophical context in which he works - the monisms of Gentile and Croce for example -is foreign to American sensibilities. Still there is much in this work that seems to resist consistent philosophical expression. The controversy between realism and idealism is rejected as "sterile," and, this destroys any privileged position of knowledge among the ingre- dients of reality. The "absolute" is affirmed to be "existence without essence." Yet we are asked to accept a distinction between natural and supernatural degrees of reality. Metaphysics is asserted to be "only psychological description," hence only subjective in its foundations. Still there are quite occasional harsh references to "religious superstition" and "Christian anthropomorphism." This sort of censure becomes all the more surprising in view of state- ments that "the absolute is without values," for "the absolute primitive barbarism is worth as much as modem civilization," etc. Still, despite the indifference of the absolute to value, we end with formulations that "human conduct is 'good' and positive insofar as it raises the level of integration and harmony of its various natural factors."
