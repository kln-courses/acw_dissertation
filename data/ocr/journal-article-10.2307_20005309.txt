BURKE Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Reading THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY I In contemporary discussion of the philosophy of religion, or for that matter of any branch of philosophy, the names of Whitehead and Wittgenstein are not often linked. Whitehead's later work is, for the most part, treated as a rather specialized interest, an attractively under-cultivated field for the enterprising thesis-writer perhaps, but well away from the main centres of current philosophical activity. And what he has to say about specifically religious or theological issues (apart from the often quoted or misquoted 'Religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness')' becomes simply one ramification of an ingenious but somewhat eccentric system. Nonetheless, there is at least this much justification for considering it in relation to the much more influential and widely discussed views of Wittgenstein. Whitehead has some original things to say about God, Wittgenstein some original reasons for thinking that Whitehead's brand of originality is here radically misplaced. And the possibility or otherwise of such theological originality is an issue of very considerable importance for the philosophy of religion. I propose, accordingly, to concentrate on the general feasibility of what Whitehead was trying to do in this field, rather than on specific criticisms of his attempt; on the question 'Is there anything wrong in principle with his trying to say something hitherto left unsaid, or at least inadequately explicated, about God?' rather than 'Granted there is nothing wrong with it in principle, how convincing are his results, or how well do they stand comparison with more orthodox theology?'. There is, however, sound enough reason for focusing on a particular thinker, rather than simply discussing theological originality in the abstract. We might indeed coin a few artificial examples to set against the Wittgensteinian case for con servatism. But if we did, we should be giving the latter an important advantage. For, taken in isolation, a sentence like 'It is as true to say that God creates the World as that the World creates God' (which is actually an example drawn from Whitehead)2 can plausibly enough be condemned as unintelligible or functionless, an obvious misuse of the familiar word 'God', or the misleading assignment to it of some new and undefined 1 Religion in the Making (Cambridge, I926), p. i6. 2 Process and Reality (Cambridge, 1929), p. 492. I RES I2</page><page sequence="2">2 T. E. BURKE sense. To do justice to it, we have to allow it a context - a language-game, if we care to put it that way, within which it is a move, in this case the characteristic language-game of Whitehead himself, and if any such exists, the small and select circle of the convinced Whiteheadians. On general Wittgensteinian principles, indeed, we must be able thus to set an expression within its proper context of discourse, if we are to discover its function and hence to be in a position to understand and assess it. And Whitehead, though of course not the only possible choice, serves our purpose well in this regard - as a thinker of undeniable intellectual stature, who was at pains to place his theological innovations within a far-ranging system of thought developed (through his later books from Science and the Modern World onwards) in considerable detail. Of course, it may be said that the Whiteheadian kind of game, as mani fested for example in the composition of Process and Reality, is notoriously one of the few that overstrains even the very wide tolerance of the theory of language-games and of 'forms of life' that give rise to them. What excludes them is presumably that their inventors cannot introduce the requisite equipment for playing them and establish its functions and the rules for its correct use, independently of other games; they are constrained to borrow from the vocabulary appropriate to religious teaching and worship, for example, and then, for their own purposes, either to break, or misleadingly to try to alter, the rules for its correct use, or to oscillate between traditional and newly assigned uses ... However, the whole point at issue is, essentially, whether Whitehead's brand of originality inevitably produces such faults. And again it is a question better considered in the specific case than in the abstract. For suppose that at least some readers of Process and Reality, the more imaginative and sympathetic among them, find that they can learn to follow and even to participate in his game, in the sense of being able to see a pattern, to anticipate with a fair degree of success what he is about to say on various points, to criticize his occasional inconsistencies, etc. Suppose also that they come to deny that there is any unbridgeable gap between, say, Whitehead's use of 'God' and related terms, and the uses they learned at Sunday School (however strange and startling some of Whitehead's assertions may appear at first sight) and claim rather that the two coalesce to yield a much richer concept of Deity than they formerly possessed - and that if Whitehead has indeed carried these terms across a language-game boundary (something, it should be noted, highly unstable and hard to define), then they have survived the move quite successfully, and there are no grounds for talking of misuse. If such claims can be seriously maintained, then should we not have a piece of solid evidence for the feasibility of originality in this field, grounds for confronting any general argument to the contrary with the awkward fact that at least once it has been achieved?</page><page sequence="3">THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY 3 II Let us take, then, some examples of characteristically Whiteheadian dicta about God and the concept of God - reminding ourselves very briefly of the contexts in which they were made. In earlier works such as The Principles of Natural Knowledge and The Concept of Nature, Whitehead had developed, with much technical ingenuity, the idea of nature as a complex, not of three-dimensional things, but of four-dimensional events. In the later works (from Science and the Modern World onwards) this evolves into the all-embracing philosophy of organism, in which reality in general is presented as a complex of 'actual occasions' or 'actual entities' which are, as it were, minimal events in the sense that, unlike the events of the earlier works, they cannot contain or 'extend over' each other. They are no longer seen simply as happening or occurring but as essentially self-creative, forming themselves out of a background or environment, and then becoming in their turn raw material for further self-creations. (The obvious analogy is with the life cycle of what we should ordinarily call organisms, for example the growth of plants from the soil, and their subsequent disintegration which contributes to its fertility.) Creativity, '. . that ultimate principle by which the many, which are the universe disjunctively, become the one actual occasion, which is the universe conjunctively' thus becomes Whitehead's 'category of the ultimate' which, he tells us, in his system '... replaces Aristotle's category of "primary substance" '.' The persistent things (and persons) which we distinguish in our ordinary discourse about the world become for him simply useful abstractions from the complex of actual occasions, patterns of characteristics (or in Whiteheadian parlance 'eternal objects') surviving through certain 'routes' or sequences of such occasions.2 Whitehead's theology, then, has to find its place within this overall system. God, and God's relations with the world, have to be characterized in terms of actual entities and their interrelations. The most obvious departure from orthodoxy (as understood at least in the Judaeo-Christian tradition) though by no means the only one that this entails is that, if self-creation is an all-pervasive feature of reality, then we cannot think of God in the traditional role of Creator, freely bringing into being a world which could not otherwise exist. Rather we must put all the emphasis on another traditional function of Deity, that of the cosmic architect or designer, Process and Reality, pp. 28f. 2 A brave attempt at a general outline of the Whiteheadian philosophy can be found in Professor Dorothy Emmet's article on Whitehead in The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (New York and London, I967), VIII, 29off. Longer treatments can be found in, for example, her Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism (London, I932), V. Lowe's 'The Development of Whitehead's Philosophy' in The Philosophy of A. N. Whitehead, ed. P. A. Schlipp (Evanston, 1941), pp. 15ff., or I. Leclerc's Whitehead's Metaphysics (London, I958). For an interesting study of Whitehead's theological views (and a comprehensive bibliography) see K.

BURKE who makes for order and harmony in the world; who strives, we might say, after the best possible world. (On Whiteheadian principles we have to use striving after, seeking or some such expression since we can no longer attribute to God unlimited power to bring about, or create.) Thus, for example, in Science and the Modern World:' God is the ultimate limitation, and this existence is the ultimate irrationality. For no reason can be given for just that limitation which it stands in this nature to impose... No reason can be given for the nature of God, because that nature is the ground of rationality. Later in the same passage, he goes on to contrast his own view with the more orthodox one, and to claim an obvious advantage for the former: He has been conceived as the foundation of the metaphysical situation with its ultimate activity. If this conception be adhered to, there can be no alternative except to discern in Him the origin of all evil as well as of all good. He is then the supreme author of the play, and to Him must therefore be ascribed its shortcomings as well as its success. If He be conceived as the supreme ground for limitation, it stands in His very nature to divide the Good from the Evil, and to establish Reason 'within her dominions supreme'. In the final chapter of Process and Reality,2 he returns to this theme of the adverse effects, not just on philosophy or theology, but on whole religious movements, of the orthodox view: The doctrine of an aboriginal, eminently real, transcendent creator, at whose fiat the world came into being, and whose imposed will it obeys, is the fallacy which has infused tragedy into the histories of Christianity and of Mahometanism. When the Western world accepted Christianity, Caesar conquered. . -the deeper idolatry, of the fashioning of God in the image of the Egyptian, Persian and Roman imperial rulers, was retained. The Church gave unto God the attributes which belonged exclusively to Caesar. Characteristically, however, Whitehead also claims to find his own view foreshadowed in some of the less emphasized, more elusive aspects of the Christian tradition. In the same passage: The brief Galilean vision of humility flickered throughout the ages, uncertainly ...It does not emphasize the ruling Caesar, or the ruthless moralist, or the unmoved mover. It dwells upon the tender elements in the world, which slowly and in quietness operate by love; and it finds purpose in the present immediacy of a kingdom not of this world. And, a few pages later: God's role... lies in the patient operation of the overpowering rationality of his conceptual harmonization. He does not create the world. He saves it.... Again, for Whitehead God is an actual entity in his sense of the term, 1 Cambridge, I953 edn, pp. 221ff. 2 Pp. 484ff.</page><page sequence="5">THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY 5 though in some respects holding a unique function within the system of such entities.' Hence the self-creative process belongs to his essence, also. And thus Whitehead attacks the concept of an entirely static God, with eminent reality, in relation to an entirely fluent world, with deficient reality. By contrast, it is his view that: Neither God, nor the World, reaches static completion. Both are in the grip of the ultimate metaphysical ground, the creative advance into novelty. Either of them, God and the World, is the instrument of novelty in the other. Whence, presumably, given a somewhat loose sense of 'creates', the point of the remark quoted earlier from the same passage: It is as true to say that God creates the World as that the World creates God. It would be difficult to multiply these quotations much further without long and cumbersome explanations of the often idiosyncratic terminology which Whitehead developed to explicate the various stages of the self creative process and the interrelations of his actual entities. But those just given may, I hope, suffice for our present purpose, to illustrate the particular character of the Whiteheadian theology and its location within the whole Whiteheadian system. III As I said at the outset, I am primarily concerned, not with the defence or criticism of Whitehead's specific attempt at an original theology, but with its feasibility in principle. To a contemporary student of philosophy coming to Whitehead, perhaps as a somewhat esoteric 'special subject' from the much more familiar fields of Wittgenstein, and philosophy influenced to varying degress by Wittgenstein, at least two grounds (not wholly un related) for questioning its feasibility are likely to present themselves - the first quite general, the second concerned specifically with religious dis course. I propose to consider the first of these in the present section, the second in the following one. To those of us who first learnt the use of the word 'God' and related terms within the Judaeo-Christian tradition, some of the Whiteheadian dicta quoted may be at first sight startling or confusing, may indeed produce various kinds of unfavourable reaction. But some of us probably would want to claim that, having read them in the context of the books in which they appear and made the required effort to set aside prejudice and join sympathetically in Whitehead's train of thought, we have acquired a fair proficiency in his particular game - we have learnt to detect the pattern, anticipate, criticize, etc. Supposing, however, we drop the somewhat risky 1 On this point, see, e.g. Process and Reality, pp. 12if.</page><page sequence="6">6 T. E. BURKE ' game' metaphor, what exactly have we learnt? In putting forward sentences like those quoted, what exactly is Whitehead giving us, or purporting to give us ? When we contrast the original and the conventional, the orthodox and the unorthodox, in theology, we are obviously talking of different treatments of what we take to be the same subject-matter. If we supposed Whitehead, for example, to be merely taking over the familiar word 'God' and applying it, confusingly and somewhat irresponsibly, to some new concept of his own, then we might ascribe originality to his conceptual scheme, but not to his theology. And it is, I think, clear enough from the way in which Whitehead himself contrasts his own views with those of his predecessors, or claims to be developing a neglected element in Christianity, that he thinks of himself as sharing a theme with the theologians and philosophers, and also with the prophets, preachers and ordinary believers, of a long tradition; as offering, in so far as his work is original, a new insight-or one that has hitherto been accorded insufficient attention-into a time honoured subject. But however we may take the relevant sentences, or however Whitehead may have intended them to be taken, we may still reasonably ask what it means to say that Whitehead meant the same thing by 'God', or that he had the same concept of God, as his predecessors. What criterion of identity are we using if we make such claims? The fact that they disagree in what they say about God is, undeniably, prima facie evidence against such identity. When major thinkers, presumably after long and serious reflection, persist in such disagreement, there is obvious reason for asking 'Are we sure they are talking about the same thing?'. No doubt many of us would want to add that, of course, such disagreement is not, or need not be, conclusive evidence of conceptual difference. Mistakes are always possible; or in some cases the trouble may be that there is no agreed method of settling a specific issue about a concept's analysis or instantiation. But, while this sounds commonsensical enough, we are left with the question of whether we have, or could have, a criterion of conceptual identity independent of broad agreement over when the concept in question is or is not correctly used. Consider the relevance here of the famous Wittgensteinian policies of asking for the use rather than the meaning and tracing words back to their original language-games. Suppose that what makes something a word in a language, a piece of linguistic equipment as opposed to a mere sound or mark, is that some set of rules or conventions for its use (even if never systematically formulated) is acknowledged (at least tacitly) by some social group - rules prescribing in what situations it can be used, what moves can be made and what effects obtained in discourse by its use (usually in conjunction with other linguistic devices). In brief, suppose it exists as a word in our language only in so far as we have some kind of working</page><page sequence="7">THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY 7 agreement about its functions. And that all we can understand by its 'meaning' or 'significance' is just this range of functions. Then, though the concept is a highly elusive one, it would seem that we can identify the concept of x only by giving the rules prescribing the correct (socially acceptable) uses of x - so that to change the rules, even tacitly, is ipso facto to change the concept. We can still, of course, allow for occasional slips, or differences of opinion about how the accepted rules apply in particular cases, without immediately diagnosing conceptual difference. And the concept of observing the same rules is not itself an exact one; we have, for example, ordinarily no precise answers to questions about just how often, or in what variety of cases, a pupil would have to use, or react to uses of, the word 'triangle' as his mentors would in similar circumstances, to convince us that he was using it in accordance with the same rules as they did, and hence had mastered their concept of triangularity (though we might conceivably devise such answers for specific purposes, like that of testing mastery of a given range of concepts by formal examination). But any persistent, or above all systematic, divergence from standard practice would certainly count as rejection, or modification, of the accepted rules of correct use, and hence of the relevant concept. It should be obvious enough how the use of such agreements and dis agreements as criteria of conceptual identity and difference can lead fairly directly to a philosophically important kind of conservatism. Of course, some forms of innovation are not ruled out. We can still call attention to hitherto unnoticed or unmentioned instantiations of concepts or relations between them. We can even try to add to the total conceptual equipment of our society by introducing new ones (though if our medium of communi cation is the written word these can presumably only be introduced as logical derivatives of concepts assumed to be shared with the unseen readers). What we cannot do is to claim that any shared concept has been generally misused (mis-analysed or mis-applied) and be right. It is not simply that no individual thinker, however gifted, is likely to see what has been over looked perhaps by generations of actual users of a concept; it is rather that whatever is generally done is necessarily right, because there is no other criterion of rightness. It follows that what we should ordinarily think of as philosophical originality, the work of someone following in the tradition of Spinoza, Leibniz, Berkeley or Hume, someone who wants to tell his fellows that they have been radically mistaken about God, mind, body, freewill, knowledge, or whatever, must be wrong. The charitable may admit that he is wrong primarily about the nature of his own achievement, and may have produced something valuable in the way of conceptual innovation, 'revisionary metaphysics', perhaps, in Professor Strawson's sense.' But if he supposed himself to be correcting common usage of existing concepts I Individuals (London, I959), p. 9.</page><page sequence="8">8 T. E. BURKE then he can only be mistaken. For the identity of these concepts is given by just this common usage. Thus, for example, when Whitehead tells us that God is the saviour of the world but not its creator, no matter how he reaches this conclusion, he must be wrong. For being creator of the world is, as it were, built into the concept of Deity which Whitehead shares with (at least most of) his readers and which forms an element of the closely interwoven system of shared concepts without which he could not communicate with them at all. And hence we can only advise him to pay more attention to how the relevant terms are actually used, or else to coin new terminology to cover the new concept he is trying to introduce.' Whitehead, I have little doubt, would protest that he was concerned, not with any invention of his own, but with the same concept of Deity as has played such an important r6le in the whole history of Western thought, and that it is his careful scrutiny of the uses made of it that has led him to the conclusion that, more often than not, the essential content of it has been obscured or mis-analysed. But to make this reply defensible even in principle we have got to find some alternative means of identifying the concept in question. We are, I think, constrained to acknowledge that our 'general use' criterion has its merits. It appears, at least, to tie down our otherwise highly elusive concepts to something comparatively concrete and accessible, i.e. the rules determining certain patterns of (mainly verbal) human behaviour. And in so doing it suggests a workable technique for the production, and criticism, of analyses of concepts, i.e. the now well-worn technique of falling back on our familiarity with how the appropriate words are used, and asking 'What would we actually say, in what circumstances, to achieve what effect?', etc. Also, in at least an everyday sense of this ambiguous term 'criterion', we undoubtedly do use broadly similar patterns of linguistic use as a criterion of conceptual identity - for example, in determining whether the pupil has mastered his mentor's geometrical concepts, or whether two philosophers of different generations who both used the word 'substance' or 'cause' had the same concept of substance or causality. And the kind of conservatism mentioned above is something much more wide spread than any specifically Wittgensteinian influence, even if the grounds for it are rarely very fully thought out, i.e. the conviction that any individual thinker proposes radical reform of a whole civilization's view of nature, man or God must surely have gone wrong somewhere; and hence, no doubt, a fairly widespread sympathy for any philosophy which offers to provide this conviction with plausible theoretical grounds. The main lines of criticism should, however, by now be fairly obvious. They consist, broadly speaking, in challenging certain assumptions under 1 The latter piece of advice was, in effect, offered by Professor R. B. Braithwaite in his review of Science and the Modern World in Mind, n.s. xxxv (1926), 499.</page><page sequence="9">THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY 9 lying the Wittgensteinian policies mentioned above. To begin with, we might ask with regard to many of our terms, including some of those with which philosophy has been most preoccupied, whether there is in fact any tolerably clear-cut and self-consistent pattern of use to be explored. If we take for example the vast range of what has been said over the centuries about God within the Judaeo-Christian tradition (or as much of it as we can discover and assimilate) or even within much narrower confines, it is somewhat naive to expect to find any obvious or indisputable dividing lines to mark off the standard or orthodox uses from the unorthodox, the eccentric, the imaginative... and the outright misuses. What counts as an orthodox, or 'accepted', use seems rather to vary drastically from one historical or social situation to another. More generally, while obviously the use, as opposed to the mere utterance, of words is a disciplined activity, and it seems a harmless enough variation to call it a rule-governed one, it is extremely difficult to draw up a comprehensive set of rules delimiting the correct uses of even the simplest words like 'white' or 'round'. And it would certainly seem very odd to suggest that we learn their correct use by learning the appropriate sets of rules (which neither pupil nor master can formulate on demand) or that our day-to-day use of them is guided by reference to such rules, in anything like the way in which a beginner learns, say, the rules governing the use of the knight or the rook in chess, and is guided by such rules when he comes to play actual games. This is one point, at least, at which the game analogy is misleading; in important respects learning to use words is just not like learning to use chess-pieces or playing-cards. Again, while we may be quite willing to admit that in some sense agreement over how to use x (over what is or is not an instance of x, or what must be, could not be or might be true of x's, etc.) is a criterion of having the same concept, of x our sense of 'criterion' may be a weak one. Do we want to claim that such agreement is the same thing as sharing the concept, or simply that we agree because we share the concept? If the latter then, of course, a criterion in a stronger sense, what Wittgenstein once called a 'defining criterion',' is still to seek. We must not assume that there is indeed any one such criterion which holds for all concepts indiscriminately. If we are thinking of examples like those of whiteness or roundness, then it seems reasonable enough to suggest that a concept can be identified by reference to the feature of the world, or of certain things in the world, which it is intended to isolate or take account of. According to this view, we acquire the concept in the first place, pre sumably, by being presented with a range of examples of the feature in question and told the appropriate word. How we go on to use the word will depend partly, no doubt, on how it is already used in the discourse 1 The Blue and Brown Books (Oxford, I969), p. 25.</page><page sequence="10">IO T. E. BURKE of those about us, partly also on what other linguistic resources we have acquired, and on our own sensitivity and imagination in spotting similarities to our prototypical cases.' After all, to master a concept is never simply to learn to replicate certain performances of our mentors, but to learn to use our own judgement about its application in novel situations; and there is nothing in the teaching of a concept which sets limits in advance to the uses that the exceptionally gifted learner may eventually find for it. On this view, we should, I think, be more inclined to say that the word is first assigned its meaning, and that this is an essential part of what determines the pattern of its uses, rather than that this pattern is determined by a set of rules analogous to those setting out the possible moves of a chess-piece - and thus at least we should avoid the embarrassment of trying to specify the rules in question. (Cf. Professor Findlay's point '... we cannot fully say, in a great many cases, how an expression is used, without saying what sort of thing it is intended to refer to, or to bring the mind. . ..)2 Of course, various objections can be raised here. The learner, like the linguistic investigator in a well-known passage of Professor Quine's Word and Object,3 would always be faced with several possibilities as to which feature of the world is the required stimulus for his mentors' utterances. Also we cannot talk as if, once given his prototypes, he can go to 'see', without tuition, what other things are 'similar' to them, or 'of the same kind'. What is to count as 'similar', etc. and for what purposes, is often a matter of rather elaborate training. These objections are not without point, but nonetheless it is dangerous to overstress either the passivity of the learner, or the role of socially established conventions in the development of his conceptual equipment. The learner, or the investigator, as Mr Cohen points out in his criticism of Professor Quine's thesis,4 is not restricted to observing ab extra his mentors' behaviour; he can also attempt to participate in their discourse and, while initial misunderstandings about the prototypes or what is to count as similar to them are likely enough, it is highly unlikely that serious misunderstandings could survive indefinitely through varied and practically successful communication. Also, does not the possibility of any set of shared conventions presuppose a shared capacity for attending to the same things, and noticing the same similarities and differences between them? For example, we can teach a child as his first introduction to language the conventional relation between the sound 'cat' and a certain species of domestic animal, but only if, without benefit of convention, we can focus his attention on the characteristic shape when it enters his visual 1 For a Wittgensteinian reaction to such accounts of concept-acquisition see, for example, Professor Pitcher's article 'About the same', Ludwig Wittgenstein: Philosophy and Language, ed. Ambrose and Lazerowitz (London, 1972), pp. I20ff. 2 'Use, Usage and Meaning', Ar. Soc. Supp. vol. XXXV (i96i), 233. 3 Cambridge (Mass.), x964 edn, pp. 28ff. 4 The Diversity of Meaning (London, 1962), p. 71.</page><page sequence="11">THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY II field, and if he notices the resemblance between its successive manifestations and between the sounds we make in pronouncing 'cat' on each occasion. Shared conventions, in short, require a shared world which satisfies the minimal conditions of having some distinguishable features stable enough to allow some scope for recognitions; and, from the parties to the con vention, some shared capacity for distinguishing these features and recog nizing their recurrences. Accordingly it would seem to be in principle possible, in some cases at any rate, to use as our criterion (in a strong sense) of whether or not A and B have the same concept of x, their agreement or disagreement to mean by x the same feature of the world. Obviously, to make such a criterion serviceable for any substantial range of cases we should need to add a good deal of elaboration and refinement. The point to be noted for present purposes, however, is simply that, given its feasibility in principle, then the possibility of a substantial measure of originality, within a shared system of concepts, becomes explicable. For even supposing some feature of the world, F, has long been recognized, and we have a well-established terminology for taking account of it, it still makes sense to suppose that the precise essence of F has always eluded us - and hence that some genius, by virtue of exceptional insight into that essence, might tell us that we have all hitherto been mistaken about F, and hence in some ways habitually misused the appropriate terms - and might be right about it. This is the essential difference between this criterion and the one previously considered; however risky and presumptuous the claims of the radical reformer - the thinker who wants to tell us that we have all been wrong about the essential nature of time, causality, freedom, knowledge or whatever - he may still be right. Once we start thinking of such examples of characteristically philosophical originality, however, doubts must arise about whether we can identify the relevant concepts by reference to features of the world which can, in any ordinary sense, be 'noticed', 'recognized', 'pointed out'.... In particular, what about the identification of our concept of Deity? If we are prepared to substitute 'contents of human experience' for 'features of the world' then, conceivably, someone might want to claim that he did, indeed, identify God as That Which, or He Who, was encountered on some specific occasions, perhaps by those specially gifted or favoured, like the prophets or the mystics. But, if so, then clearly we should have a very sharp distinction between the God of the prophets, etc. and the God of the philosophers; also, if more than one occasion of experience is referred to in the identification, a problem arises about why we should think that the same Being was encountered in all of them. Without denying the importance of such experiences, both in individual lives and in whole religious movements, however, I should question whether many believers have in fact literally identifed God in this way. They may be unshakably convinced that God</page><page sequence="12">I2 T. E. BURKE has been so encountered, and much of what they say about God may be determined by the nature of such encounters. But it is a case of identifying That Which (or He Who) is encountered as God, rather than the other way round - a procedure which, of course, presupposes that they already have, from whatever source, a concept of God. Certainly, for Whitehead, though he seems prepared to admit that in some sense other actual entities have experience of God, such experiences have no essential role in the identification of the concept. It would seem much nearer the truth to say that he identifies it by reference to its function within a wider system of thought - and hence that any claim that, despite his unorthodoxies, he is still using the same concept as his Christian or Jewish predecessors, must be based on this identity of function. What Whitehead himself took that function to be is made quite explicit in the passage already quoted from Science and the Modern World-'God is the ultimate limitation, and His existence is the ultimate irrationality... No reason can be given for the nature of God, because that nature is the ground of rationality.' Roughly speaking, this amounts to saying that, within the range of religious and philosophical thinking in which he is interested, the unique function of the shared concept of Deity is to be the end-stop of explanation, to provide the ultimate reason why the world (including our own position within it) is as it is, without itself being explic able, or requiring explanation, by appeal to anything further. Suppose - if only for the sake of argument - that he is substantially right about this. Then, again, it is easy enough to see that there is in principle scope for originality, and originality of the kind Whitehead himself exhibited, without endangering the identity of the concept. For it is open to him to maintain, as in effect he does, that his predecessors have, for the most part, been mistaken over what it is about the world that requires such explanation - a mistake which arises, in Whitehead's view, primarily because the rest of their thinking about the world was over-abstract or over-simplified, a confusion of the useful abstraction with the concrete reality. And a revision of our whole way of thinking designed to do fuller justice to the nature of this reality - as Whitehead would presumably have characterized his philosophy of organism - may well bring about a sig nificant shifting of the points at which we appeal to the 'ultimate limitation', while leaving us as convinced as ever that such an appeal has to be made somewhere. If so, then there is indeed a sense in which he can claim to have retained the time-honoured concept of such a limitation intact, while offering, in the light of his revision of other parts of our conceptual equip ment, a novel analysis of what it is to be this 'ultimate limitation'. Once again, I am not concerned here with the defence or criticism of specific Whiteheadian doctrines, but rather with the feasibility in principle of his enterprise. Quite possibly this scope for originality (if such there is)</page><page sequence="13">THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY I3 could be as well or better exploited by thinkers who differed profoundly from Whitehead, including perhaps some whose analyses convinced them that this concept of an ultimate limitation is essentially incoherent, and hence can yield no self-consistent account of the nature or function of such a being. The point to be noted is simply how the use of unique function in thought as a criterion (in a strong sense) of conceptual identity provides a sense in which Whitehead (or any of these possible rivals) could offer an original analysis of the content of the traditional concept of deity, and, conceivably, be right. If we want to evaluate his attempt, then, no ex ploration, however meticulous, of what we (or some social group) ordinarily would or would not say about God will serve our purpose. We must first make the effort to evaluate the whole distinctively Whiteheadian world view, the whole philosophy of organism. Does it indeed justify its claim to be more faithful to the concrete reality of our world than earlier and more familiar views? And does it, in so doing, induce us to alter our ideas about what needs for its explanation an appeal to something beyond the spatio temporal world? Probably only a few of those qualified to judge would answer these questions with an unequivocal Yes. But what matters is that they have to be raised if Whitehead's attempt at theological originality is to be evaluated; it cannot be condemned solely on the basis of general considerations about concept-identity. IV Nonetheless, it may be as well to keep in mind other lessons that many of us have learned, or relearned, from Wittgenstein, and tread carefully in applying these general considerations to the particular case of the concept of God. Indeed, the very use of this phrase 'the concept of God' may be encouraging us to force certain elements of our thought and experience into a mould unsuited to them, to assimilate them too hastily and insensitively to whatever paradigms are effectively guiding our general thinking about concepts. Even though we talk about the unique function of the concept of God, we are still assuming, or leaving unchallenged the assumption, that it so functions that God is a possible field of research, in the same way as some aspect of nature or human life might be - i.e. something there to be explored, scrutinized, analysed. . ., something about which we can formulate, defend, establish or refute theses regarding its properties, and its r6le in the general scheme of things. This is taken for granted by Whitehead, and of course by many other philosophers and theologians. All the same, this is quite arguably at variance with what 'God', and God, have actually meant to the great mass of religious believers, in what we have called the Judaeo-Christian tradition. And one merit, at least, of the Wittgensteinian preoccupation with the</page><page sequence="14">I4 T. E. BURKE nuances of ordinary usage is that it leads us to raise the fundamental question whether anything that can be thus researched can actually be identified with the God of that tradition. For it may be that the concept of God (if we must use this expression) is actually unique in such away that it rules out such research - and hence the possibility of any original or revolutionary theses about God. If so, an original thinker may, on the basis of what was said in the previous section, have good grounds for telling his fellows that they have been mistaken about freewill or immortality, or any of a good many other things - but not about God. Before we go any further, it may be well to remind ourselves that here also we are dealing with ideas which are older and more widespread than any specifically Wittgensteinian influence, and that they have, undeniably, a fairly deep-rooted appeal. To the genuinely religious, it may well seem presumptuous, if not impious, for any human being to undertake to explore and characterize the divine. (Warnings against such enterprises go a long way back: 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'... .'God is in Heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few .2) Are we not handi capped in any such enquiry by the fact that our conceptual equipment for conducting it is general primarily to the finite and the temporal, and that we can at best offer highly dubious analogies? Can our results be other than pathetically inadequate to their subject-matter? Further, in any relationship between man and anything worthy of the name of God, must not the initiative for the development of the relationship rest entirely with God? And if we adopt the standpoint of the researcher, framing and trying out hypotheses, etc. do we not in effect make our subject-matter, whatever we may call it, something less than God, by assuming this initiative our selves - no matter what 'metaphysical compliments' (to borrow Whitehead's phrase)3 we pay God in the end? We say, for example, such things as 'Leibniz makes God responsible for the pre-established harmony'. And this is a proper enough way of putting it; for undoubtedly it is Leibniz here who is making the running, rather than God. But is there not something tragi-comic in the relationship it implies? Still, we might ask, in spite of such reservations about natural theology in general, is it not a fact that our sympathetic and imaginative reader, taking Whitehead's theological teaching in the context of his whole system, can find it genuinely illuminating? The critic, however, may reasonably enough press us as to just what kind of illumination we claim to receive. What exactly do we get from statements like those quoted earlier from Whitehead? Perhaps some kind of picture or model of reality as a system of interacting elements, a system within which God plays an essential role ... And the picture somehow helps to make this role seem intelligible 1 Job II: 7. 2 Ecclesiastes 5: 2. 3 Science and the Modern World, p. 222.</page><page sequence="15">THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY I5 or comprehensible to us. But how do we make the picture and how does it perform this function? Obviously, as has already been indicated, for the making we must perforce borrow equipment from much more limited fields of interest, as Whitehead does from the field of biology. Is the technique, then, in effect, to lean heavily on our down-to-earth paradigms of growth, creation, selection, etc. in order to get the picture into con vincingly sharp focus; and then to help it do its job as a picture of reality in general by allowing it quietly to slip out of focus again -when we remind ourselves that, after all, we are only dealing in 'metaphors mutely appealing for an imaginative leap',l wisely leaving unspecific what provides momentum for the leap or where it lands us. As Austin put it, regarding some other examples of philosophical discourse, 'There's the bit where you say it and the bit where you take it back'.2 Think, for example, how often Whitehead and many others permit themselves, or are driven, to talk as if God were one person among others (seeing, thinking, deciding, acting, etc. like a finite human being) in direct conflict with their own declared theses. Further, the critic may proceed, the construction or reconstruction of such a picture no doubt provides a certain satisfaction, perhaps partially aesthetic, and a certain sense of illumination, of seeing the scheme of things more clearly. But it is fundamentally unlike either a scientific discovery or a religious conversion, and brings the benefits of neither. There is no possible experience which can test its correctness, since it is designed to be consistent with every experience. It does not map the world or any part of it for us, does not enable us to find our way about in it any better. Nor does it tell us how to behave in the world, what set of values to pursue, or offer any hope for the future, or demand a commitment to any specific way of life. As a result the initial satisfaction is only too likely to give place to an irreverent 'So what... ?'. The religious believer's 'coming to know God' is something almost diametrically opposed to this - a matter of divine self-revelation rather than human enquiry, grace rather than intellectual acumen, the new appreciation of ancient truths shared with the rest of the faithful rather than the discovery and defence of new truths, the acceptance of discipleship rather than the acquisition of a personal reputation. In the context of recent philosophy of religion many of these points of contrast have, of course, been brought out with characteristic sensitivity and perceptiveness in the works of Wittgenstein and those who might reasonably be called Wittgensteinians. We may recall, for example, Witt genstein's own analysis of the 'enormous gulf' between religious believer and unbeliever, the 'entirely different planes' on which they find them selves, as contrasted with the comparatively bridgeable gap between those 1 Process and Reality, p. 4. 2 Sense and Sensibilia (Oxford, I 962), p. 2.</page><page sequence="16">i6 T. E. BURKE who disagree over, say, an empirical thesis.' A characteristically religious doctrine, like that of the Last Judgement, emerges not so much as a result, or possible result, of research, something for or against which we might marshal arguments, as something which provides 'guidance' for, or 'regu lates', the believer's whole range of thought and activity. Or take Professor Phillips' thesis that '.. . beliefs, such as belief in the Last Judgement, are not testable hypotheses but absolutes for believers in so far as they pre dominate in and determine much of their thinking. The absolute beliefs are the criteria not the objects of assessment. To construe these beliefs as hypotheses that may or may not be true is to falsify their character.'2 Clearly, according to these views, Whitehead (and presumably virtually any other exponent of what we should ordinarily call natural theology) is radically misguided from the moment he starts to question the truth of traditional doctrines, or make a case for their replacement by new ones; in this realm research, the weighing of rival theses, and the attempt to establish truth-values are all alike out of place. There has, of course, been no lack of critics to maintain that, while this Wittgensteinian view may successfully highlight some aspects of religious belief, the attempt to treat the issue of truth or falsity as irrelevant to it cannot be sustained. Thus, for example, Professor Neilsen in a recent work: 'A Christian or Jew must, in believing in God, believe that there are true and false statements concerning divinity and some of them are of the magnitude of "the whole universe is under the sovereignty of God". A Christian or Jew must believe that this is not just expressive/evocative, commissive or pictorial talk.'3 The arguments of such critics are by now too well known to need elaboration here. We should, however, notice how taking into account the importance of the concept of revelation, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, may help us at some points to do better justice to both the Wittgensteinians and their critics in this regard. Central to the whole tradition is the idea of a deity who does not leave mankind to discover his existence and nature for themselves, but who takes the initiative, as it were, identifies himself to them (or to his chosen spokesmen among them) and reveals to them whatever they need to know about his nature and purposes. In both time and importance, 'Thus saith the Lord...' takes precedence over 'This is what the Lord is like...'. And the theologian or the preacher who speaks about God must defer to the greater authority of the prophet or evangelist who is accepted as speakingfor God. When we recall this belief in the divine origin of religious doctrines, then we can readily enough appreciate the 'enormous gulf' or 'difference 1 Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief (Oxford, I966), pp. 53ff. 2 'Religious beliefs and language-games,' Ratio xiI (1970), 35. 3 Scepticism (London, 1973), pp. 39f.</page><page sequence="17">THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY I7 in planes' which Wittgenstein finds between believer and unbeliever. For between the person who believes that certain doctrines are literally God given and the person who does not (even if the latter accepted some of them as true or probably true on the basis of philosophical argument or historical research) there is a difference much more radical, and much more pervasive of the whole manner of life, than that between those who simply disagree about, say, some matter of empirical fact. Again, we can readily see why such doctrines should be treated as 'absolutes' (as Professor Phillips puts it), 'the criteria not the objects of assessment'. If, for example, a believer accepts the Bible as the inspired Word of God, then he must regard it as the judge of history, science and philosophy rather than the other way round; it can do without their support, and if, at any stages in their development, they are in conflict with it, then so much the worse for them. On the other hand, the traditional believer would certainly agree with Professor Neilsen that it is essential to his position that he accepts certain statements (i.e. formulations of the content of revelation) as true - and without any shift in the senses of 'statement' or 'true' between secular and religious contexts. Indeed, the importance of revelation for him (apart from the assurance it provides of divine concern for mankind) is that it offers a guarantee of the truth of such statements, stronger and more permanent than any human research could provide. What distinguishes them from, say, the findings of natural science, is not that they belong to some alternative man-made form of discourse, or 'form of life', with different criteria of correctness; rather that their genesis is not human at all but divine. All this, of course, leaves Whitehead, or any other would-be natural theologian with an original mind, still unemployed. For, even if the role of truth-claims in religious discourse is acknowledged, yet if the deity is regarded as having himself revealed the relevant body of truths to man, then even explication must seem a trifle presumptuous, to say nothing of alteration or addition. At best one might offer reformulations or simpli fications to meet the needs of specific audiences. (And, as a point of historical fact, some of the most fervent religious believers have been highly suspicious of any brand of theology.) Hence even if we reject the Wittgensteinian analysis of what gives characteristically religious beliefs their 'absolute' quality, we may still admit that, for those who hold them, they are absolute, outside the realm of arguable theses, requiring that all other beliefs, and indeed the whole form of life, shall conform to them... And between those who hold them and those who do not there is a radical difference in criteria of rightness and wrongness in religious discourse. To the fundamentalist as such, for example, the sceptic's arguments must be unsuccessful; if his scientific or historical evidence conflicts with the Bible, then, whatever</page><page sequence="18">I8 T. E. BURKE other criteria of correctness it may satisfy, it is ipso facto mistaken; if his analysis shows any biblical statements as incoherent or mutually inconsistent, then ipso facto he is misunderstanding them or committing some error in analysis. And even if the fundamentalist cannot meet the challenge to point out the specific error here and now, this is of course inconclusive. Conversions either way are possible here, but in their absence disputation is futile. And hence someone like Whitehead, selecting among traditional religious doctrines, or proposing modifications of them, on the basis of a revised cosmological system, is seriously misunderstanding the whole function of those doctrines among those who actually formulated them, held them, ordered their lives in accordance with them and, often enough, persecuted and were persecuted for the sake of them. v No doubt there are some manifestations of religion as impervious to philosophy as the foregoing account suggests - some individuals or sects who regard their essential doctrines as literally verbally inspired by God himself (and who would answer the obvious questions about how they learnt to identify the subject-matter of such doctrines, or understand the terms used in their formulations, by further appeals to divine grace). And in such cases there is, of course, very little neutral ground for dialogue or disputation with unbelievers; even the would-be believer could presumably only be advised to wait for enlightenment or perhaps to pray for it (though to a deity of whom he could have at most a very oblique understanding). Taken as a characterization of religion, or of our Judaeo-Christian tradition, in general, this account must however appear as something of a caricature. The belief in divine initiative, that human knowledge of God cannot be, like knowledge of nature, simply the outcome of research on a passive or indifferent subject-matter, is widespread enough. But belief in the verbal inspiration of one's doctrines is surely somewhat rare, and, for most of those whom we should want to call sincerely religious, is likely to suggest fanaticism and self-delusion. Few would want to claim more than that they 'see through a glass, darkly'. Doubtless immediate experiences of many kinds have helped to keep alive, whether or not they initiated, our obscure but deep conviction that man is not just an element in physical nature, that there is something transcending, though variously manifested in, that nature, with which he is vitally concerned and which is somehow concerned with him. But most believers, while understandably cherishing such experiences, would admit that in the tasks of evaluating them, develop ing some means of distinguishing genuine from spurious among them, finding formulations to fix or stabilize them in our memories and make communi cation about them possible, we are left largely to our own devices.</page><page sequence="19">THEOLOGICAL ORIGINALITY I9 If we take this view, then of course we sacrifice something in the way of certainty and finality; we also gain something in the way of tolerance - if our own inadequate and impermanent formulations are not worth dying for, neither are they worth killing for - and avoidance of the dangers of anthropomorphism. Of more immediate interest for our present purposes, however, is the fact that, according to this view of religion, religious dis course cannot be anything like a self-contained language-game, with its own special criteria of correctness and incorrectness. The Wittgensteinian view might indeed serve better as a characterization, accurate enough so far as it goes though incomplete, of some of the more extreme manifestations of religious enthusiasm than of religion in general. But suppose we grant that evaluation and formulation are left to human resources. To find con ceptual equipment for the tasks, we must, presumably, borrow from any likely source among our more mundane fields of interest, for example, those of relations with our fellow-humans or with our natural environment - parenthood, creation, planning, caring, etc. And whatever latitude we may give ourselves for non-literal, analogical use, the borrowings serve our purpose only if what makes for correct, or felicitous, use of such concepts in a religious context is largely determined, at least, by what makes them so in the original, secular one. Hence there can be no question of straight forwardly different criteria. Of course, believers may well find all such borrowings more or less inadequate and the analogies all more or less misleading; often indeed it would seem that the deeper their religious convictions, or the more intense their experience, the more dissatisfied they are with any attempt at formu lation. But most of them have, in effect, allowed that, for purposes like those indicated above, it is worthwhile to make such attempts, rather than just to stay silent - and braved the danger of becoming too much wedded to one form of words, one set of analogies, so as to over-estimate its importance or let it come between them and its subject-matter (the danger from which C. S. Lewis wisely asks deliverance in his lines 'Thoughts are but coins: let me not trust, instead/Of Thee, the thumb-worn image of Thy head'). What the believers say about their God may indeed be helpful and illuminating in many situations of discourse, but they may still do well to acknowledge, with due humility, that much of what they say is all the more imperfect and ephemeral for being about the perfect and eternal. Clearly, there is some room here for expertise and for innovation, for the efforts of the philosopher or theologian who has developed familiarity with this difficult field of discourse, and can offer his fellows some fresh guidance through its potentialities and pitfalls. Of course, however gifted he may be, we cannot ask him for exactitude or finality, if, as suggested above, these are ruled out by the very nature of the task. We cannot, on this view, reasonably ask him for the definitive account of his chosen subject-matter, for The</page><page sequence="20">20 T. E. BURKE Truth about it, but only for the helpful analogy, the model which clarifies some of its features and, if discreetly used, is not too seriously misleading. (It is worth noting of course that, in this regard, his work differs in degree rather than kind from a lot that we should ordinarily accept as part of science, where in some fields of interest exactitude and finality can also prove elusive, and the construction of simplified models is quite a respectable occupation.) Above all else, perhaps, we can expect him to be acutely self-conscious of just what he and his colleagues are doing, of the gap between their formulations, however ingenious, and their subject-matter, and the oblique relationship of the one to the other; acutely sensitive and imaginative, also, as to what is central to this widely shared and long standing conviction of a realm transcending the spatio-temporal, and what is merely an eccentric offshoot, or a characterization in the idiom of a particular time or society... Our criteria for assessing his achievements are, of course, inexact; but, again, this at most distinguishes them in degree rather than in kind from many other forms of intellectual achievement. Obviously there is no experi mental way of checking his results, nor any rigorous technique of analysis. We judge, rather, by whether the new conceptual apparatus he offers enables us more satisfactorily to articulate (give expression to, get into focus... ) what is for the most part only very dimly aiid uncertainly appre hended; or, failing that, by how convincingly he brings out the inevitable unsatisfactoriness of all such apparatus. Judged on such counts Whitehead, I think, might well earn at least a partially favourable assessment from those who make the effort to understand him. But the essential point here is to show the possibility in principle of an account of theological discourse which makes meaningful such essays as his in theological originality, and our assessment of them.</page></plain_text>
