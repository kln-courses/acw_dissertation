<plain_text><page sequence="1">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS E history of modern thought is in its main features JL the history of natural science. In that Aristophanic chorus of many voices it takes no very keen ear to detect the dominance of those to which science has given the key note; and even the dissonant strains are determined by that against which they rebel. Either as pro-scientific or anti-scientific Western philosophy has revolved about the ever increasing mass of natural knowledge. Art, religion, poetry, as well as pure philosophy, in so far as they possess vitality today, derive their significance from science; they either accept or protest against a world of thought and action which is the creation of the scientific spirit. Like Emerson's Brahma, science can say: On the face of things, the contest is merely the modern version of an ancient feud?between the lovers of con crete fulness and the abstractionists, the Goethes and New tons, or, as William James so neatly puts it, between the "thick" and "thin" plilosophies. But though this is true in a measure, the dichotomy is not so simple. That which complicates it, and at the same time exacerbates the con flict, is the success of science, particularly of the science of physics. This has worked in two ways. They reckon ill who leave me out : When me they fly, I am the wings.</page><page sequence="2">212 THE MONIST First, by enlarging man's power over matter, it has made possible new modes of life, and these activities have reacted on our ways of thinking. In this practical sphere it is not a matter of rival philosophies; we have rather a discord between the round of our daily life and our tradi tional creeds. The history of the so-called "warfare" be tween science and religion is but a chronicle of street riots, sporadic affrays between the native inhabitants and new comers who were in possession of the country before their presence had been noted. The Fundamentalist never made a serious fight over the operations of the Weather Bureau ; he consults his doctor when sick; he takes his car to a mechanic for repairs. He turned frantically on Darwin ?two generations ago in England, and again recently in America?as if the publication of the Origin of Species had constituted the first attack on his faith. The vehemence of this protest was itself symptomatic of the inner discord ; the whole Fundamentalist movement might be described, in the jargon of the psycho-analysts, as the expression of an inferiority complex by organized religion. For, long be fore Darwin, the western world had built up a civilization and a mode of daily life in which a definitely anticipated future took the place of complete uncertainty as to the behavior of an arbitrary despot. That mode of thought which flourished in the intellectual climate of the middle ages has a hard struggle to survive in this day of machines and popular government. The transition from an age in which little seemed knowable, but everything important known, to one offering endless possibility but no finality of knowledge, has required much hardihood of those who faced it consciously. It is small wonder that the common man, like the sailor in the crew of Columbus, is seized with sudden panic on realizing the voyage on which he has em barked.</page><page sequence="3">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS 213 But there is a second way in which the success of sci ence has reacted more directly on philosophy. Considered simply as a body of abstract knowledge, the science of physics towers above all other creations of the modern mind. With the work of Newton and his followers began a new era of speculative thought, and the revolution thus inaugurated has run its course independently for the most part of the increase of mechanical inventions and of the industrial expansion which was its later fruit. Without minimizing the importance of the Copernican theory in the history of philosophy, I think it may be claimed that the effect of the Principia has been more profound. The adjustments demanded by the former concerned mainly the cruder parts of theology,?the location of heaven and hell, the naive anthropomorphism of the Old Testament and the literal acceptance of its cosmology. These adjustments could be made without impairing any essential attribute of the divine power; indeed they might be considered as enhancing it. With the appearance of the Principia, on the other hand, the conception of unchanging natural law, of inexorable order, passed from the almost exclusive pos session of a small group of scientific workers and became the common property of thinking men. The science of mechanics was brought very quickly to practical perfection, and this most perfect part of the edifice of science became the pattern toward which all the other builders strove. Not only were the laws of mechanics of great simplicity and elegance, but in the motion of the planets they were exemplified on so grand a scale, both of space and time, that the imagination of men took fire. We all know what vistas opened out to the eyes of eighteenth century ration alism; how its enthusiasts looked forward to a world which under the dominion of mathematics would be foreseeable</page><page sequence="4">214 THE MONIST in all its details. The intoxication of that first triumph has now long subsided, but the concept of law has re mained, and today we are able to appraise more exactly the extent of the wreckage it has wrought among the older beliefs. The devastation has been wholesale. The appalling vastness of the Copernican universe could have been borne with some equanimity; the oppressive order of the New tonian has swept all before it. God himself has been all but dethroned; from his position of absolute ruler and active participator in the daily lives of men he has been reduced to the status of a constitutional monarch, a figure head allowed to reign only on condition that he does not interfere. That which happens is the only thing that could have happened ; our finite eyes may read the book prepared for them, but that book is already complete from title-page to colophon. Calvinistic theology may save the dignity of God by considering natural laws as his self-imposed limita tions, but the old intimate relation between man and his Creator?that relation which in the middle ages flowered so gloriously in the great cathedrals?has vanished from the vision of those who have tried in all honesty of soul to see God through nature. The spirit of man is today en meshed in a web of fine-spun deterministic logic, and each advance of science seems to add another strand for our imprisonment. This, determinism, is the bitter poison in the cup of knowledge, paralyzing man's efforts, changing to gray the green and gold of life, its music to mocking laughter. It was in the nineteenth century that the revolt against the determinism of science took shape. The violence of the attack on Darwin was the expression not merely of a re sentment of the moment, but of a long accumulation of in</page><page sequence="5">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS 215 juries. The Origin of Species gave the excuse for an out burst long overdue. Whatever we may think of Tennyson as a poet, we must set it down to the credit of his intel ligence that in In Memoriam he saw the real issue,?not the simian ancestry of man but the blind mechanism of the cosmic process. But we find a better, though subtler, ex pression of the revolt in Edward Fitzgerald. Instead of the Credo quia impossibile of In Memoriam we have, in his rendering of the Rubaiyat, an outward acceptance of the new philosophy,?"The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes" ; but it is the acceptance of an insult which one is powerless to avenge. A Moment's Halt?a momentary taste Of Being from the Well amid the Waste And Lo !?the phantom Caravan has reach'd The Nothing it set out from?Oh, make haste ! Into those last three words are breathed his utter scorn for "this sorry scheme of things,"?a scorn which found its last expression in his defiant epitaph: "It is He that hath made us and not we ourselves." All that is left to man is sardonic laughter and the creation of beauty. In Thomas Hardy we find a similar note. His characters are the characters of Greek tragedy, puppets of circum stance to whom the artist accords the pity that the cos mos withholds. It is not that, like Tennyson, these writers were consciously reacting to a formulated philosophy; rather they struggled for breath in the atmosphere into which they were born. But besides the revolt expressed by art and literature, there has been a philosophic reaction. As representative of this dissident attitude we may take the philosophies of James and Bergson. It is no accident that the strongest protest should come from these "thick" philosophers; it is their sense of the unexpressed, of the left-out in the seien</page><page sequence="6">216 THE MONIST tifie scheme that provokes it. If, with the absolutists, we are content to whittle concrete reality down to an abstrac tion, one abstraction is as good as another; such a mind can find complete satisfaction in the proposition that de terminism is the fullest freedom, or some equally fatuous paradox. For William James it is the fullness of life to which science denies expression, and which must have its due. "If a certain formula for expressing the nature of the world violates my moral demand, I shall feel as free to throw it overboard, or at least to doubt it, as if it disap pointed my demand for uniformity of sequence." James insists on the validity of the subjective testi mony, as against retrospective wisdom or objective obser vation. ". . . decisions, for him who makes them, are altogether peculiar psychic facts. Self-luminous and self-justifying at the living moment at which they occur, they appeal to no outside moment to put its stamp upon them or make them continuous with the rest of nature. Themselves it is rather who seem to make nature continuous ; and in their strange and intense function of granting consent to one possibility and withholding it from another, to transform an equivocal and double future into an inalterable and simple past." Bergson, like James, finds in subjective experience the warrant for his beliefs, but his solution is at once more radical and more critical. The scientific account of things is not merely too partial; it is impotent to grasp reality. Not only science, but logic is without power to lay hold of the reality of things-becoming; their kingdom is the dead, static past. With rare critical insight he singles out the reason for this limitation. Logic is spatial think ing; it is concerned with separations, overlappings, inclu sions ; with the relations of parts and wholes, all of which can be symbolized and represented as relations of exten</page><page sequence="7">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS 217 sion. On the living tissue of experience, on motion, on transition it can lay no hold; for these things-becoming it ever substitutes the dead shell of the thing-become. Time, as time passing, is the creative process itself. Only when the trickling moment is congealed in the stillness of the past can it be scrutinized, dissected, compared. Time, to be thought about logically, must become space,?that is, past time. All of which is all very well for those who can find solace for their Weltschmerz in a rejection, partial or com plete, of the scientific presupposition. The stumbling block in the way of their acceptance is the success of science. Both James and Bergson rest their argument on the sup posed limitations of the scientific approach to reality. Their reasoning, if accepted, leaves us free to believe in indeter minism, but that is all. They produce no new magic for mula capable of victories of its own to match the conquer ing onrush of science. Both writers admit, in effect, that science as such rests on determinism. To the practical, pragmatic mind they thus concede everything. Abstract reasoning can make little headway against the logic of success, the argument of "method and results." If de terminism is a necessity of thought for the physicist, it is bound to invade biology and psychology, however valiantly the rearguard of the vitalists and introspectionists may dispute the advance. For the success of determinism as a working hypothesis is undoubted. The whole history of biology is a chronicle of its victories and of the shifts of the vitalists in their endeavors to find some corner not accessible to the chemist and physicist, some phenomena distinctively vital. The behaviorists have started a similar assault in psychology, denying the existence of the dis tinctively psychic and asserting that the objective traits of human behavior?that is, the material reactions of</page><page sequence="8">218 THE MONIST the organism?are alone knowable and that their descrip tion exhausts reality. With determinism as a working hypothesis there can be no quarrel. The physicist may be interested only in those aspects of nature which fall within its scope; the biologist may limit his study to phenomena expressible in the mechanistic formula; the behaviorist may assert "con sciousness" to be none of his business. But, unless some rival hypothesis can be shown to be equally effective, it is against all reason to imagine that it will retain this pro visional character. The meaning of the word will shift from epistemology to ontology, hypothesis will become dogma, and the meaning of the universe will pass from a pragmatic "as if" to a categorical "nothing but." We cannot meet this advance by pointing to the lack of proof. It is idle to talk of limits to scientific inquiry, for science has again and again broken through such barriers and there can be no assurance that the new ones will hold. Nor will a mere license to doubt determinism avail much, if all that is positive and triumphant in human thought is bound up with belief. But what if there should be an alternative hypothesis, powerful in its own right to order experience and interpret nature? What if the concept of indeterminism, void of positive content as it might at first seem, could be shown to be able to dominate autonomously a realm of its own and even perhaps to invade the kingdom of its enemy ? In that case the situation is completely changed. Determinism can never progress beyond the stage of an hypothesis,? entitled, indeed, to a full acknowledgment of its pragmatic value but to no pretensions of dogmatic sanctity. But can this be done? It has been done already. A large and growing body of modern physical theory rests, in effect, on a postulate</page><page sequence="9">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS 219 of indeterminism in events. Only an ignorance of science and a slavish worship of dialectic has prevented the recog nition of this fact by philosophers. Science is, in fact, one thing ; and the philosophy of science quite another. Science stands to philosophy in the relation which literature bears to criticism, art to aesthetics ;?the one active, self-justify ing, unconscious ; the other withdrawn, hesitant, introspec tive. Just as the living tissue of creative writing has a way of breaking through all set forms, disregarding all canons of criticism and making a new tradition, the grow ing body of science has found little nourishment in the "methods" it has been supposed to follow. Since the time when Bacon erected the preposterous fabric of his Or ganon to the present, the creative element in science has eluded the grasp of criticism. It was Bacon's contempor ary, Harvey, I believe, who said that Bacon's ideas of science were "such as might be expected of a Lord Chan cellor." John Stuart Mill's Canons of Induction have waited till quite recently for a similar devasting criticism by Norman Campbell: "If the discovery of laws could be reduced to a set of formal rules, anyone who learnt the rules could discover laws. But there is no broad road to progress. Herein lies the most serious objection to much that has been written on the methods of science. There is no method, and it is because there is no method which can be expounded to all the world that science is a delight to those who possess the instincts which make methods unnecessary." This is not to deny to philosophy an important func tion; it is to emphasize its true function. This consists not in teaching the fish to swim and the bird to fly, not in laying down rules for the scientist to follow under penalties of excommunication; but in extracting from a certain phase of creative activity its universal significance. Not the meaning of science for the scientist, but its meaning</page><page sequence="10">220 THE MONIST for art, for religion, for life itself is the philosopher's con cern. In furtherance of this object it is incumbent on the philosopher to see science as it is, not to force it into an arbitrary mould. It is precisely here, I think, that he has failed. The philosopher has chosen to see in mechanics the perfect type of science, of which all other modes were but incomplete realizations. By so doing he has been able to erect neat, self-contained systems; the stuffed animal has proved much more manageable than a live one. With apparently complete self-satisfaction he has ruled out as "unscientific" or as "illogical" anything that would not fit the scheme. Thus, while the philosopher has gone one way, the scientist has gone another, refusing to accept re sponsibility for dialectic tangles, content with his prag matism and meeting Eleatic dilemmas with a "solvitur ambulando" The body of physical theory to which I refer and which I claim involves the abandonment of the deterministic pos tulate is the theory of so-called "irreversible" phenomena. The laws of these rest, according to our present view, on a statistical basis; their formulation and interpretation is in terms of the theory of probability, and this in turn is irreconcilable with determinism. In the following argu ment I shall avoid as far as possible the technicalities of physics, limiting my illustrations to matters of every-day knowledge. Though the exposition is at best a difficult matter, I have some hope of setting its main features in a clear light, leaving for later treatment some of the impli cations of the main thesis. The philosophical essence of the science of mechanics is to be found in the concept of time which it uses. The planet swings round the sun ; yesterday it was there, today it is here, tomorrow it will be yonder; but this yesterday, today and tomorrow are but illusions imposed by the finite</page><page sequence="11">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS 221 ness of our senses. Where the planet was and where it will be are both accessible to the mind. That which has happened still is, and that which will happen must be and thus in a sense exists already. Effective causation is an illusion ; the present is no more determined by the past than by the future; the past, the present and the future are bound together in a single coherent whole which, to the eternal mind, simply is. For it is characteristic of the laws of mechanics that the recovery of the past and the prediction of the future are on exactly the same footing. If nothing but the direc tion of motion were changed, the future history of this new mechanical universe would recapitulate the past his tory of the old. The phenomena are, as we say, reversible. Past and future have for mechanics no more absolute sig nificance than right and left, forward and back. So long as we deal with these reversible coherences we may apply the ideas of Einstein, convert time into another dimension of space and plot every event in a four-dimensional etern ity. It is to Bergson that we owe the clear perception of this spatial character of mechanical time. He was, how ever, imperfectly familiar with the science of his day and hence assumed spatial time to be "the" time of all scien tific thinking. The result has been a quite unnecessary opposition of his views to scientific modes of thought, an opposition which leaves him, like Berkeley, with the prob lem of accounting for the possibility of objective knowl edge. It will be seen in what follows that actual scientific thought is in much closer accord with Bergsonian ideas than he imagined. For even if we ignore the testimony to which Bergson makes appeal, namely, the facts of our subjective life and those of organic nature, we cannot thus reduce the em pirically given universe to a timeless geometric manifold.</page><page sequence="12">222 THE MONIST Whatever the ideal world of dynamics may be like, the actual inanimate world is one in which things happen, in which past and future are absolute, not relative categories. Thunder follows lightning. If we place a kettle of water on the stove, the water gets hotter, not colder. Quite apart from the forms of life, the earth itself has changed in a way not comparable to its motion in its orbit ; the change is not part of a cycle. Certain processes of nature are, as we say, irreversible. I use the word as the physicist uses it, without metaphysical commitment or connotation, simply to describe the empirically given fact. It may be that the world is so constructed that even here the distinction be tween past and future is one to which nothing in rational thought corresponds, that there is no reason a priori why an observer should find the course of events going in one direction rather than another. The earth moves in an orbit which, seen from the north, is described counterclock wise, but no one imagines that this direction is to be pre ferred over the reverse as having profounder roots in the very order of being. If we leave out of the argument, as I do here, the fact that the universe is experienced or thought about by human minds, it might be claimed that the "time" in all physical processes could and possibly does "run backward" somewhere else. Those who hold to the mechanical concepts are bound, it seems to me, to admit the possibility of such a universe as conceivable on equal terms with the one we know, but I shall not press the point. The physicist at least has accepted the fact of such irre versible processes as a part of his experience, and has sought not only to formulate empirical laws but to obtain some insight into their nature. This insight was furnished by Clerk Maxwell through his work on the kinetic theory of gases. The atomic theory, of ancient origin, had been applied by Dalton to</page><page sequence="13">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS 223 explain the facts of chemistry, but until Maxwell's time it had little importance as a physical hypothesis. With the kinetic theory of gases was inaugurated a new method of physical inquiry,?the statistical method. Since then its scope has been vastly extended, but it has not received from philosophers the attention that it deserves. It cuts more deeply into our ideas about nature than is generally recognized and, as I hope to show, leads to a cosmology radically different from that based on Newtonian ideas. To make this clearer it will be well to have one or two illustrations of irreversible processes so that the argument can be pointed with concrete examples. Suppose I put into a glass some red ink and some blue ink. If I pour carefully I can have one color at the bottom of the glass and another at the top with a fairly sharp line of separa tion. This condition will not be permanent. Left to them selves, the colors will gradually mix by diffusion. Any thing that we can do in the way of stirring or agitation will only hasten this process of mixing ; we cannot alter the direction of the process. A second simple illustration is that of a hot body A and a cold body placed in contact. What happens we describe as a flow of heat from A to which continues until both bodies are at the same tempera ture. The description of these two processes in terms of the atomic theory is on its face very simple. We consider the molecules, either of the liquids or of the hot and cold bodies, as colliding at random, and thus foresee the final result as the statistical outcome of an enormous number of individual collisions. We say that the mixed state of the inks, or the equal temperature of the two bodies, is "more probable" than the unmixed state or the unequal temperatures,?so much more probable that its eventual</page><page sequence="14">224 THE MONIST attainment is a matter of practical certainty. The pro cesses are seen as exactly like those involved in shuffling a pack of cards. If we take a new pack fresh from the maker, the cards are arranged in a certain "regular" order. As we shuffle, this order is replaced by other arrangements which we call "irregular." We say that the irregular ar rangement is more probable than the regular, but this does not mean that any one arrangement is more probable than any other. It is the kind of arrangement that is more probable. Of all the possible ways that we may arrange a pack (the number of which, though large, is finite) a very small proportion are singled out as regular, while the over whelming majority are lumped together as irregular. The greater probability of the irregular is for the same reason that white sheep eat more than black?there are more of them. In the same way, of all the equally probable distri butions of the ink molecules in the glass, all but a very small fraction constitute what we call mixtures; of all the equally probable interchanges of energy between the fast moving molecules of the hot body and the slower-moving molecules of the cold body, an overwhelming proportion involves a loss of energy by the fast molecules and a gain by the slow molecules. All our calculations of probability are made in this way. We analyse the possibilities into equally probable instances, and find the probability of some one characteristic or quality of the event by calculating what proportion of all these possibilities possesses the as signed character. If we grant an understanding of the meaning of equal probability, the rest of the physicist's argument presents no special logical difficulties. But what do we mean when we say that two events are equally prob able? What, indeed, do we mean when we talk of prob ability at all? From the determinist point of view the word means</page><page sequence="15">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS 225 nothing except as a name to cloak our ignorance. The die or the coin falls in the manner preordained for it; where necessity reigns there can be no talk of real possibilities in the future, or of real probabilities. To speak thus is to say that the future holds genuine alternatives; it is to negate the principle of causation. There is no need to re capitulate at length all the old arguments. For this con tention is really an admission of what I should have been at some pains to prove ; namely, that the idea of probability is inconsistent with the idea of necessity. We may even go further and admit that the deterministic standpoint is the only one consistent with the processes of formal logic; that the concept of probability eludes all attempts to formu late it logically and leads us into a maze of paradox. For instance, suppose we say that in the fall of a coin heads and tails are equally probable. When challenged to define our terms we make a poor showing. We may say that in a large number of throws the percentages of heads and tails will be equal, or we may appeal to the accumulated results of past trials. But neither of these statements covers the content of the original assertion. For our pre diction of the future cannot be absolute but must itself be stated as a probability, while our inference from the past is likewise only probable. We are thus forced to de fine one probability in terms of another and our logic comes full-circle upon itself. No logical way out of the difficulty has been found or seems likely to be found. Whoever wishes a fuller presentation of the difficulty should read the chapter on probability in Poincare's Science and Hypothesis. But though determinism and logic agree as to the proper way to deal with the question, this way is altogether too summary. Decapitation is indeed a sovereign remedy for most diseases, but it has always been unpopular. In</page><page sequence="16">226 THE MONIST spite of logic, the assertion that heads and tails are equally probable is much more than a confession of ignorance,? its significance is positive. And though we may deduce from the assertion other affirmations about the statistics of repeated trials, the primary meaning relates to one event; we affirm this event to possess a certain quality or characteristic. We know practically the meaning which we cannot express. The assertion of probability deter mines a certain practical attitude toward the future. De void of logical foundation as the theory of probability undoubtedly is, it is able to meet this pragmatic test of rationality; it helps us to organize our experience and heightens our sense of understanding of the empirical data. I know that to many pragmatism is epistemological anarchy; and many more will be appalled at the thought of dispensing with logic. But the situation is none of my making. I am describing the way in which a good deal of scientific thinking is carried on today and, logical or not, this thinking seems to those concerned with the increase of positive knowledge to be important. But though we cannot resolve the paradox, I think that Bergson has given us more than a hint as to the real na ture of the difficulty. May not this lie in the fact that all logical thought is spatial, that its scope is limited to those relationships, such as the whole-and-part relation, which can be symbolized by extension ? For space, with its added dimension of time past, is the universe of things-become. Probability is our mode of laying hold on the not-yet-be come, on time as opposed to space. It is not so much illogical as non-logical. It opens to the mind a domain to which spatial thought cannot penetrate. I hope to show presently that it leads to conclusions of a different order from those attainable by canonical logic. But first I must make one point clear.</page><page sequence="17">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS 227 This is that the very concept of probability denies de terminism. "May" and "must" are irreconcilable. When I say that the chances are equal of the coin coming up heads or tails, I assume that the event is not yet a part of nature. The course of nature in the matter of penny pitching behaves as if the result were not merely unknown, but unknowable; as if the result of each toss were unre lated to previous events. The assumption may be wrong but it is superfluous nonsense to say that indeterminism is inconceivable. That which is apparently true is certainly conceivable. Another illustration will help to show more clearly that the concept of probability involves the idea of unrelatedness. Suppose I calculate the probability of a given hand of cards. From the result of this calculation I make a prediction about the statistics of such hands. This prediction is an affirmation as to the course of certain natural events, and can hence be tested by experiment. But to make this test valid, it is necessary to shuffle the pack thoroughly between each deal, thus deliberately breaking the links which bind one hand to the next. It is no answer to this for the determinist to say that the links cannot really be broken ; that if we knew all the steps the outcome of each deal would be a matter of certain foreknowledge. For the question here is not what we might know, but why we shuffle, and to this question the determinist can give no answer. If the whole question is one of ignorance or knowledge, why do we endeavor by shuffling to increase our ignorance? But not only does the concept of probability deny de terminism; it leads to a prediction which is not accessible to the determinist. Return to the simpler example of the coin. Let us allow the determinist his knowledge of causes. Thus armed, he calculates for us the result of a hundred throws. He predicts for us a certain succession</page><page sequence="18">228 THE MONIST of heads and tails and the relative percentages of these are necessarily included in his forecast. But they will be the percentages for that particular problem; the statistical prediction as such will elude his mathematics. He will only be able to assert that it "just happened" that way, because his causal data "just happened" to be that kind of data. While his figures may tell him that there will be, say, forty-five heads and fifty-five tails, this fact has for his point of view no significance. The indeterminist, on the other hand, goes straight to the statistical prediction with the aid of his assumption. Though he never reaches absolute certainty of the future, he speaks with more as surance of the result of a million throws than of a hun dred. The more hopelessly insoluble the problem consid ered as one of causes, the more certain the prediction based on the assumption that there are no causes. If the concept of probability is merely a cloak for our ignorance of causes, in what strange manner does increase of ig norance bring certainty of knowledge? Please bear in mind that I am not attempting a refuta tion of determinism. On the contrary, I believe that in the very nature of things this is impossible, for it would require us to show that things could have happened other wise than as they did, and nothing in nature is really re peated. All that I have attempted is to deprive the doc trine of that philosophical sanctity which attaches to a supposed necessity of thought; to show that the doctrine of indeterminism plays an important part in actual scien tific thought, and that it shares with determinism such pragmatic prestige as attaches to the success of science. But while a physicist could supply the scientific corollaries to my talk of cards and penny-pitching, the general reader will be left somewhat in the dark as to the scope and seien</page><page sequence="19">DETERMINISM AND MODERN PHYSICS 229 tifie importance of the statistical method. This omission I must now make good so far as space will permit. At the present writing the science of physics is in a state of transition and therefore of comparative confu sion, and any sweeping statement as to what doctrines are generally accepted could quite properly be challenged. Avoiding these difficult questions of dogma, we are on safer ground if we indicate merely those tendencies of modern speculation which have demonstrated their useful ness; and chief among these is the so-called quantum theory. The definite article is misleading; there is not one quantum theory but many. But the common element of all these is the belief?first forced on the physicist by stubborn facts and later triumphantly applied in the con quest of new knowledge?that the processes of inanimate nature are fundamentally discontinuous, and that even the apparently continuous and determinate sequences of me chanical phenomena are but a composite statistical picture, made up of individual events which are governed by rela tions of probability. Thus the apparent determinism which our laws postu late becomes only a practical determinism of a statistical result, based on a "fine-grained" indeterminism in the con stituent atomic phenomena. Not that the physicist has formulated any such doctrine. Most of them would be shocked at finding that they have lent any support to such damnable heresy, denying as it does the invariability of the causal relation. But I at least can see no escape from this conclusion as the practical upshot of their train of thought. For it will be noted that the temporal relation of cause to effect is, from the statistical point of view, in compatible with the determinist postulate of invariability. Only on the assumption that something else may happen</page><page sequence="20">230 the monist can we essert what probably will happen. The development of modern physics makes at least conceivable the hypothesis that all the order to be found in nature is a statistical order, into the constituents of which there enters an element of indeterminism. Determinism has been dispensed with as a necessity of rational thought in so far as the thinking of men like Bohr and Einstein can be called rational. To see this clearly is our first need if we would bring our philoso phy into line with our activity, and if I have made a begin ning toward proving this one point, it is as much as I have a right to hope for. But much more remains to be done. The implications of this new cosmology in biology and psychol ogy cut pretty deeply into current conceptions, for it is in the realm of probability that the living shows the widest divergence from the non-living. And it is above all here that there is need of a philosophy which does not deny its own significance,?to which possibilities are something more than illusion, and creative effort a reality. C. M.
