Mrs. Langer declares that if we hope to gain any real insight into the evo- lution of human from animal mentality, we need first a "much clearer idea of animal mentality than we are employing in zoology and psychol- ogy today." The conceptual framework of animal psychology is still "loose and flimsy," and her purpose is to firm it up with more realistic working concepts (pp. 103, 104). If sometimes her particular interpretations sound too fanciful, her criticisms are in general sound, and her recommendations combine unusual sensitivity with stout commonsense. Her wide reading is enlivened by an imaginative empathy with animal life which is all too often lacking in the formulations of practical ecologists. Indeed, to many readers her panoramic presentation of instinctual activity may seem the most rewarding section of her work. There is no attempt to reduce the mental gulf between man and the higher animals. The whole of her argument is geared to the belief that con- cept formation "starts very high up on the evolutionary ladder" and is vir- tually restricted to man. Animal behavior is guided by instinct, not by envisaged purpose. Instinctual acts are "behavioral wholes," highly articu- lated, species-specific patterns of activity set in motion by feeling. The whole pattern of activity is preformed in the impulse which is its beginning and is controlled throughout by internal pressure deriving from the initial impulse, not, as in man, from an image or concept of a goal to be achieved. Animals have organic memories of past activities but no store of images or memories of past occasions on which they can draw. "I doubt that non- human creatures find act values in things through remembered needs" (p. 128). In keeping with this the perceptual world of animals is more closely tied up with the context of current activities than is ours. Their space is "action space," not a geometrical space populated by relatively stable, physically defined objects with variable attributes. The crucial value of their perceptions lies in the felt context of the current situation in which they occur. They lack even our conceptual functions to define the boundary between subject and object. Mrs. Langer rejects both the mechanistic and the anthropomorphic ex-</page><page sequence="2">90 Harold Osborne planations of animal behavior, arguing at some length against the usual ethological interpretations in terms of imitation, communication, or signal- ling, cooperation, deception, etc. ("I hold that no animal can deliberately feign, deceive, distort evidence, or invent any ruse to trick an antagonist.") But she holds that suggestibility and empathy (an "involuntary breach of individual separateness" not to be identified with sympathy) play a far greater role in animal life than with men. Animal behavior is neither altru- istic (socially motivated) nor selfish, but, being guided always by present feeling, it is always egocentric. All this is ably presented, and if it is some- times a little one-sidedly weighted in the direction of her own preconcep- tions, it is always suggestive of stimulating ideas likely to be fruitful of a better understanding. The purpose is to establish a background against which to delineate the "Great Shift" from the animal world to the specifi- cally human. The distinctively human attribute which accounts for the "shift from animal mentality to mind" is said to be the power of symbolization. Ani- mals do not have it (p. 293). The intuition of symbolic meaning is a human speciality. And symbolism is born of imagination. "Dream images are, in fact, symbolic forms..." (p. 279). And: "It is in dream that the imagina- tive powers are born. . ." (p. 288). Image formation was at first entirely involuntary as in dream, but "in the primitive stages of hominid specializa- tion dream may not have occurred exclusively or even mainly in sleep" (p. 283). The involuntary imagery of dream was the source of the waking image, both involuntary and voluntary. From it came the deliberate envis- agement of things not present and situations not actually given. All image formation is represented as the recurrence of neglected, perhaps unnoticed though physically received, impressions-from the instinctual and organic point of view "unfinished business." "The impulses they touched off were nipped in the bud and not used up in conjunction with other responses..." (p. 282). Therefore they tend to be strongly tinged with nonspecific emo- tion and carry with them a feeling of strangeness and mystery, of unrecog- nized significance. Conceptualization is inherent in imagery. "The image is a genuine con- ception;it does not signalize or demand its object, but denotes it" (p. 306). And concept formation develops hand in hand with the growth of language. Concepts are not abstracted from sensory experience but imposed upon it. Concepts are born of words, and the nature of the language we use influ- ences our ways of thinking, our ways of perceiving what meets the senses, and our ways of classifying what we perceive. The categories of thought are not given in direct experience but are implicit in the language we apply to experience. All this is linked with the emergence of a new sense of time and specifically human kinds of memory.</page><page sequence="3">Essay Review 91 Our knowledge of animal and the most primitive hominid mentality is necessarily second-hand and therefore in the last resort speculative. But Mrs. Langer makes out as convincing a case for most of her interpretations as can be made. If her novel theoretical concepts will not make the hoped- for impact on biology, ethology, and psychology, at least her work cannot be overlooked by anyone who is interested in the evolution of mind. It must be said, however, in conclusion that the expectation of deriving from the fine arts insights fertile of new understanding in the biological field is doomed to disappointment. The suggested analogy between rhythm in the arts and the alleged rhythm of organic processes fails to command convic- tion, and the central idea of symbolism has no more than a verbal identity in the two spheres. The symbolism of art by the replication of the mor- phology of emotion bears hardly the most distant likeness to the symbol- ism of meaning claimed for imagery and concept. The connection is a subjective, not an objective one; both fields represent passionate interests of the writer. And this does not detract from her eminence in both. But there is a tendency throughout to ascribe excessive interpretative value to concepts which are so widely articulated that they can mean anything-or nothing- in any context at all. NOTES 1.
