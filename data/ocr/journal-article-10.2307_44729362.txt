ABSTRACT This paper presents the experimental dynamic tolerance and the force-deformation response corridor of the human cervical spine under compression loading. Twenty human cadaver head- neck complexes were tested using a crown impact to the head at speeds from 2.5 m/s to 8 m/s. The cervical spine was evaluated for pre-alignment by using the concept of the stiffest axis. Mid cervical column (C3 to C5) vertebral body wedge, burst, and vertical fractures were produced in compression. Posterior ligament tears in the lower column occurred under flexion. Anterior longitudinal ligament tears and spinous process fractures occurred under extension. Mean values were: force at failure, 3326 N; deformation at failure, 18 mm; stiffness, 555 N/mm. The deformation at failure parameter was associated with the least variance and should describe the most accurate tolerance measure for the population as a whole. INTRODUCTION Cervical spine injuries occur as a result of motor vehicle crashes, falls, and athletic related incidents. These injuries can be severe and costly both to the individual and to society as a whole. Our understanding of the mechanism and biomechanics associated with these injuries comes from an analysis of the epidemiological literature as well as a limited number of experimental studies. Despite improvements in pre-hospital stabilization and transport as well as the addition of comprehensive centers for definitive treatment, spinal injury continues to represent a health care problem of major significance. Spinal cord injuries carry very high risks of disability and fatality. From epidemiological studies we understand that cervical spinal injuries can result from a number of different motor vehicle crashes including frontal, side, rear and rollover. Survivors of spinal cord injury require extensive medical treatment and long term care. Previous epidemiological studies have indicated that the majority of survivors of cervical spinal cord injury have mid cervical spinal column fracture/dislocations (C4-C6) resulting from compression or compression-flexion related trauma [5,18]. The importance of compressive related cervical spine injury has also been reflected in the experimental literature as a number of previous studies experimentally evaluated compressive related trauma to the head-neck complex of cadavers [1, 4, 7, 8, 10-13, 15-17, 19, 21, 22]. Many of these previous studies noted that the pre- alignment condition of the cervical column with respect to the head was an important factor in determining the resulting spinal column injury [10- 13]. From our previous experimental work [13, 14, 20] as well as the theoretical work by Liu and Dai [6] , it can be surmised that the "stiffest axis" of the cervical spine results when the cervical lordosis is removed and the spinal vertebrae are aligned vertically. Cervical alignment along this axis prior to compressive loading has been noted to produce compression related injuries to the mid column (C4- 5-6) vertebral bodies [3, 13, 20] . For the application of automotive related trauma, a necessary focus of cervical spine injury 3087</page><page sequence="2">research should be the development of anthropomorphic test devices (ATD). A first step in the process of creating design parameters to develop biofidelic ATD's is to obtain dynamic tolerance data and force-deformation corridors that describe the behavior of the cervical spine. The purpose of this paper therefore, is to present the dynamic force- deformation corridors under compressive loading for the human cadaver head-neck complex, to describe the injury tolerance of the human cadaver cervical column under compression related forces, and to describe the affect of pre-alignment condition of the cervical spinal column on the resulting injury mechanism and biomechanical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS Specimen Preparation and Mounting- Dynamic compression tests were performed on a total of 20 human cadaver head-neck complexes according to a previously established protocol [13]. Some results from the first six preparations have been reported previously [13] and were re-analyzed for the purpose of the present study. The age ranged from 29 to 95 years (mean = 62 ± 15); there were nine females and 11 males and all were cardiopulmonary related deaths. Briefly, human cadaver head-neck complexes were mounted in fixative at T1-T2 inferiorly; the cranium was left intact superiorly. The inferior of the preparation was mounted to a six-axis load cell and firmly fixed to the platform of an electrohydraulic piston apparatus (MTS Systems Corp., Minneapolis, MN). The cervical spine was pre-aligned to remove the lordosis of the column by including 15 to 30 degrees of head flexion. The head was held in place using pulleys and deadweights. A schematic of the test setup is shown (Figure 1). A flat plate with 20 mm thick ensolite padding was fixed to the piston of the testing device and served as the impact surface. Recorded transducer measurements included an in-series load cell and displacement gauge in the piston and an accelerometer on the impactor. A six- axis load cell (Denton, Inc., Rochester Hills, MI) recorded the generalized force histories at the inferior of the preparation. Retroreflective pin targets were placed in the vertebrae anteriorly in the vertebral body, in the lateral mass, and in the spinous process. A 16 mm high-speed camera was used to document the kinematics of the event in the Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the human cadaver ligamentous head-neck preparation. The set-up included a pulley-weight system anteriorly, and a spring posteriorly to pre-align the specimen. A six-axis load cell was mounted inferiorly and the electrohydraulic piston applied loads to the crown of the head. Retroreflective pin targets were used to document the kinematics. sagittal plane. Preparations were dynamically impacted at speeds from 2.5 m/s to 8 m/s. All specimens were tested to failure with piston contact displacements from 25 to 40 mm. Transducer data were recorded using a digital data acquisition system at sampling rates from 8 to 12.5 kHz according to SAE J21 lb specifications, and post-processed with a SAE class 1000 digital filter. Analysis - Preparations were examined for pre-alignment condition by evaluating pretest x-rays taken prior to impact. The zero position for the "stiffest axis" was defined as the occipital condyles aligned vertically over the middle of the T1 vertebral body (Figure 2). Preparations with occipital condyles anterior to the T1 vertebral body were defined as positive pre-alignment and preparations with occipital condyles aligned posteriorly to the T1 vertebral body were assigned negative pre-alignment (Figure 2). 3088</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2: Illustrations describing the definition used in pre-alignment of specimens. The "stiffest axis" was defined as in B where the occipital condyles are aligned over the center of the T1 vertebral body. Specimens aligned with occipital condyles anterior to the stiffest axis (A) were assigned positive values, and specimens aligned posterior (C) were assigned negative values. All preparations had 15°-30° of head flexion. The mechanism of injury was defined from viewing the 16 mm film and movements of the retroreflective pin targets. At the location of the primary injury, as defined by clinical evaluation of post-test x-rays, computed tomography (CT), and cryosections, the localized movements of the spinal column were defined as either extension, compression, or flexion. For example, specimen N07 demonstrated an anterior vertebral body fracture of C4 from examination of the ČT's and x- rays; the kinematic analysis of the targets indicated downward movements of each component (vertebral body, lateral mass, spinous process) and was thus classified as a compression injury. Each primary injury was also defined as either minor, moderate, or severe as follows: Minor Vertebral and/or soft tissue trauma not requiring appreciable clinical intervention, i.e., neither internal or external intervention. Moderate Vertebral and/or soft tissue trauma requiring moderate clinical intervention with external and possibly internal (surgical) intervention. Severe Vertebral and/or soft tissue trauma requiring appreciable clinical intervention including both internal (surgical) and external (orthosis) intervention. Each test was analyzed to obtain the dynamic force-deformation characteristics. The superior inferior force from the inferiorly mounted six-axis load cell was plotted against the deformation of the piston testing device. Since displacement of the piston occurred prior to contact with the cranium, the in-line force recorded on the piston was used to define the cranium contact. At the point of initial rise of the superior piston force, time zero was noted. The initiation of neck loading was determined using the kinematic film data by tracking the target on the head at the level of the occipital condyles. The first detection of movement was taken as time zero for neck loading and the resulting dynamic force-deformation responses began at this time. Dynamic stiffness was obtained by taking the slope of the force-deformation response in the linear phase just before failure. RESULTS A summary table of the various derived and recorded parameters is provided (Table 1). Out of the 16 preparations that were pre-aligned close to the stiffest axis (± 0.5 cm), 11 produced directcompression injuries.

Extension failures occurred in preparations with slight initial lordosis of the cervical spine; flexion injuries occurred in preparations with slight kyphosis of the column. The three preparations that were pre-aligned two or more centimeters anterior to the "stiffest axis" all produced similar lower column flexion injuries with no bony injury. Injuries occurring under compression were consistently mid-column fractures of the vertebral bodies, with burst, wedge, and vertical fractures (Figure 3). Injuries occurring in the flexion mode were more ligamentous having a component of posterior ligament involvement. The three spines that failed under an extension mechanism all had anterior ligament involvement (Figure 4). The load duration to failure for all specimens was less than ten msec. Generally, the spines that demonstrated compression failure mechanisms had greater values of failure force (mean = 3334 N) and stiffness (mean = 585 N/mm) than spines failing in flexion or extension (exception; specimen N05, 38 yr. old, extension). Neck displacement at failure was generally consistent, with no particular patterns with regard to mechanism of injury, injury severity, or age (overall mean = 18 ± 3 mm). When classifying the injuries in terms of severity, there was no one biomechanical parameter that described a trend. The mean stiffness values decreased slightly but not significantly from minor (621 N/mm) to moderate (578 N/mm) to severe (474 N/mm).

The mean response curve was derived from the mean force at failure (3326 N), mean deformation at failure (18 mm), and mean stiffness (555 N/mm). This stiffness depicts the upper end of the curve; the average stiffness (3326 N divided by 18 mm) is 185 N/mm. DISCUSSION The human cervical spinal column has to resist physiologic as well as traumatic forces. Under these conditions, it is important to maintain the normal functional relationships between the bony elements of the spine and the cervical spinal cord. Clinical studies indicate that under traumatic situations such as motor vehicle crashes, surviving victims with cervical injuries often have compression related trauma to the mid column [2, 18]. These injuries have significant societal costs. To reduce the risk of injury to the occupant of a motor vehicle, safer vehicles must be designed. A major tool in the development of safer vehicles is the anthropomorphic test devices. To increase the biofidelity of the ATD, human volunteer and cadaver experimentation must be done. This paper describes the compressive tolerance of the human cadaver head-neck under axial loading to the crown of the head. The dynamic force-deformation corridor has been determined as a guide for further improvement to the ATD neck. 3091</page><page sequence="6">7000-1 « 6000- ļ 5000- fi 2 4000 - II o 3000- / /fĒ il 2000- jjļļMfļ / 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Deformation (mm) Figure 5: Dynamic human cervical spine force- deformation response curves for 20 cadaver specimens loaded under axial compression with impact to the crown of the head. In the present series of tests, several different biomechanical parameters were recorded. Previous investigators examining cervical spine injuries noted that the pre-alignment condition of the cervical spine is a major contributor to the resulting injury pattern [3, 11]. The previous studies from our laboratory indicated that axial compressive burst fractures were experimentally reproduced only under one particular pre-alignment condition [13, 20, 22], To provide a definition for pre-alignment the term "stiffest axis" was adopted as theoretically described by Liu and Dai [6] . The stiffest axis can be defined experimentally as the pre-alignment condition that results when a given amount of load produces the least amount of deformation [14]. This was determined for the cervical spine through previous experimental studies as the occipital condyles vertically aligned over the center of the T1 vertebral body accompanied by 15 to 30 degrees of head flexion. A similar "center of minimum stiffness" for the cervical spine in torsion has been reported [9] . In the present series of tests, the pre- alignment was measured with respect to the stiffest axis definition. Of the 16 preparations that were aligned on or close to the stiffest axis (± 0.5 cm), 1 1 produced axial compression injuries of the mid- column. For the three preparations that were aligned greater than 1 .5 cm anterior to the stiffest axis, all resulted in flexion injuries to the lower column. It appears that there is a "window" of alignment that is necessary to produce mid-column compression injuries, and outside of that window, distinctively different injuries occur. This may be the "cone" of the second stiffest axis suggested previously [6] . From the present series of tests, mid column bony compression injuries occurred only when pre-alignment was within ± 1 cm of the stiffest axis. Although the resulting injury patterns were affected by pre-alignment, the biomechanical parameters within this sample population were not significantly different. Statistical analyses did not reveal any significant correlations between any of the measured biomechanical parameters and pre- alignment. The dynamic force-deformation responses all fit into a fairly narrow corridor. Perhaps when pre-alignment becomes drastically different than what was used in the present series of tests will the biomechanical parameters demonstrate significant variations. It can be stated with confidence however, that any alignment outside the window of the stiffest axis, will never produce mid-column compressive bony injuries of the cervical spine. Thus, if it is the intent to address these kinds of clinically relevant injuries that are routinely demonstrated in surviving victims of motor vehicle crashes, the present resulting corridors are valid. To determine the mechanisms of injury, the resulting pathology as determined by gross examination, x-ray, CT, and cryomicrotomy, was evaluated with respect to the high-speed film of each test. The retroreflective targets inserted into bony landmarks of the vertebrae were examined according to previous methods [13,20]. Kinematic analysis of adjacent targets documented when the injury occurred, and the mode (flexion, extension, or compression) of the affected area of the column was determined to be the injury mechanism. The rest of the column may have been under a different mode. For example, specimen N09 produced a fracture of the C3 vertebral body under local compression, however the lower aspect of the column went into extension without injury. It can also be noted that for essentially the same loading vector, (crown impact to the head) a variety of different injury mechanisms can be produced, 3092</page><page sequence="7">depending more on the configuration of the spine prior to loading. This implies that without sufficient external data (e.g., scalp laceration) an assumed mechanism of injury from retrospective evaluation of radiographs may not be correct. 5000-1 « 4000- » i ^3000- III 0 III ü I I £ 2000- III 1000- III 0 - ^ n-r-r-pr-r-r-r- 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Deformation (mm) Figure 6: Derived human neck dynamic force- deformation corridor. The dashed line indicates the mean response curve derived from the mean force at failure (3326 N), mean deformation at failure (18 mm), and mean stiffness (555 N/mm). The mean values of force and deformation at failure describe the compression tolerance of the spine. The dynamic force-deformation response curves indicated a region of softer response initially, followed by a significantly stiffer region before failure. This type of curve is typical of biological tissues. The initial less-stiff region represents contributions from the soft tissues (e.g., intervertebral discs) and the more-stiff region from the bony components. On a microscopic level, soft tissue structures respond by initial straightening of the collagen fibers as they are stretched in response to an applied load. In the present study, kinematic analysis revealed the initial compression of the intervertebral discs at this time followed by relevant bony compressions during the stiffer phase. Deformation of each disc results in the 5-10 mm of soft response. Others have also shown this initial soft response with cadaver cervical spines tested in compression [10]. The biomechanical parameters were analyzed with respect to injury severity and mechanism of injury. There was a wide variation of values for force at failure and stiffness. These did not seem to be dependent upon any singular factor although mean stiffness values decreased slightly, but not significantly, from minor to moderate to severe injuries. This may confirm the intuitive notion that the stiffer column is more resistant to severe injuries. Failure loads ranged from 744 N to 643 1 N, perhaps indicating the varying nature of the population in terms of age (range 29 to 95) and gender. A second order polynomial regression analysis between failure force and age increase demonstrated decreasing tendencies, however with weak correlation (R2 = 0.33). The mean failure force of 3326 N can be described as the compressive neck loading tolerance of this population (mean age: 62 yrs). A more consistent measure of tolerance may be the value of neck deformation to failure however, which had much less variance (mean: 18 mm) with a standard deviation of three mm. The suggested compressive loading corridor given in figure 6 also includes the mean response curve from all 20 specimens using the mean from failure force, failure deformation, and stiffness variables. This corridor describes the structural characteristics of the human cadaver neck in direct compression. Perhaps a preliminary design of an ATD neck useful for compressive loading could follow this loading corridor and include a single measurement of axial deflection to describe the tolerance criteria.
