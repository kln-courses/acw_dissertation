<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ethnohistory. Within this interdisciplinary approach, there is a great emphasis on the iconography (papers by Laporte and Fialko, Freidel, Coggins, Schele), and at least in one case (Freidel) it is demonstrated in great detail how the ancient Maya symbols (in this case, the Jester god) changed and transformed over the time, with different cultural implications for the social or- ganization from Preclassic into Postclassic. While the image might stay the same, its context and meaning significantly shift over the longer periods of time. Preparing publications based on conferences is very often connected with the risk that some or most of the contributions will be out-of-date by the date that the book becomes available to the general public (in this case, more than four years have passed since the con- ference, and two years since the book was actually fin- ished in April of 1991!). However, the editors, con- tributors, and the publisher did a great job by updating some contributions in the process, so that as a final product we have a nicely printed (with a lot of draw- ings, architectural reconstructions, and site plans) and very useful summary of the work in the last decade, but also a book that can pose questions for future re- search. Vision and Revision is certainly open to criti- cism and revision(s), but right now, it is without any doubt the best book on Maya studies. The New World Figurine Project, Vol. 1. TERRY STOCKER, editor. Research Press, Provo, Utah, 1991. vi + 165 pp., figures, tables, references. $23.00 (cloth) Reviewed by James A. Chiarelli, Brandeis University, and The Center for Field Research, Watertown, Mas- sachusetts. In the editorial introduction to this volume, Terry Stocker takes note of the fact that figurines, when men- tioned in archaeological site reports, are often classified as a "minor artifact category." Anthropomorphic, zo- omorphic, and other kinds of figurines are known from many archaeological contexts throughout the world, but it would be safe to say that the attention such materials receive from scholars is disproportionately small when measured against their ubiquity in the archaeological record. Figurines constitute a potentially significant ar- chaeological data base that is at once enticing in its size and variability and forbidding in light of the per- ceived limitations of currently available interpretive frameworks. This first volume of a projected multi- volume series presents 13 papers by authors who, for the most part, approach the study of figurines from New World sites in fairly traditional ways and in most- ly descriptive terms. Stocker, again in the introduction, states that "the primary goal of the New World Fig- urine Project is description," and descriptions are pri- marily what the contributors have delivered. Three of the 13 articles focus on methodological or theoretical issues. There is one article on preceramic figurines from Aspero, Peru, and one on Mississippian figurines. Two concern figurines from the northwestern United States, two are on Valdivia figurines, and the remaining four present figurine data from mesoamer- ican sites. Since it is impossible to summarize every article in this collection, I will mention five that stand out due to the authors' attempts to move beyond description and toward some interpretive or processual explana- tion of their materials. David Grove's and Susan Gil- lespie's 1987 article (reprinted from Archaeology) con- cludes that many of the more than 4,000 figurine fragments recovered at the central Mexican site of Chalcatzingo represent portraits of deified Middle For- mative rulers. Joanne Mack concludes that the geo- graphical and cultural distribution of realistically ren- dered Late Archaic zoomorphic figurines from the western Cascades is indicative of complex trade net- works among upland groups as early as A.D. 1000. William Fowler examines figurines from the site of Cihuatan, El Salvador, and evidence of a Postclassic incursion by Pipil immigrants from Mexico. Kevin Smith considers the potential roles of figurine analysis and ethnographic analogy in determining the nature of Mississippian social organization, mortuary practices, and religious-symbolic behavior. Lastly, Terry Stocker closes the volume with an unabashedly diffusionist ap- preciation of certain aspects of New World prehistory including the now-legendary Valdivia-Jomon problem and the possibility that "Olmec sailors" mounted trad- ing expeditions among the peoples of the American southeast. This article will undoubtedly draw fire from his colleagues. The New World Figurine Project is a handsomely produced, large-format volume with ample and infor- mative illustrations. Several typographical errors and what appears to be an inconsistent editorial hand give the book as a whole a somewhat uneven quality. Nev- ertheless, it is a welcome contribution to New World archaeology, and we should look forward to future vol- umes. Mechanics of Pre-industrial Technology. BRIAN COT- TERELL and JOHAN KAMMINGA. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990. xv + 325 pp., figures, tables, appendixes, references, index. $49.50 (cloth). Reviewed by Phillip de Barros, Stanton, California. This is the first general review of the mechanics of preindustrial technology and represents the joint efforts of an engineer (Brian Cotterell) and an archaeologist (Johan Kamminga). The book's purpose is to present the basic principles of mechanics and show how they help us understand the artifacts and technological pro- cesses of ancient and traditional cultures. The authors see several benefits to providing a mechanical per- spective to the discipline of archaeology. First, by fo- cusing on the mechanical processes of artifacts, ar- chaeologists can better understand which attributes are functional (especially in mechanical terms) and which are stylistic. Such a mechanical base should lead to better typologies of material culture, which have often been based on a mixture of functional and stylistic attributes (e.g., projectile-point typologies). The authors also see mechanical data as useful for reconstructing culture histories, measuring material development, understanding human adaptation to the environment, and for developing theories of culture 592 [Vol. 58, No. 3, 1993]</page></plain_text>
