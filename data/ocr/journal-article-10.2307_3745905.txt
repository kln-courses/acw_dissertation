<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHY OF A BUSINESS MAN Professor G. DAWES HICKS, F.BA. English Philosophy owes much that is most characteristic of it to the assiduous toil of men whose vocation has not been that of academic teaching and research. Many of them have been engulfed in the routine of business life, and such hours as they could devote to philosophic reflexion have been snatched from intervals of leisure which the majority of business men relinquish to recreation and rest. The friend to whose memory I wish to pay my humble tribute would not have claimed for himself, nor have permitted his associates to claim for him, the distinction of having initiated a new line of speculative reflexion. But, if he did not propound any original metaphysical theory, he possessed, in quite unusual measure, the facility of discerning that which was fundamental in the teaching of others, and of bringing the resources of a well-stored mind to bear upon it. For from his youth he had been an omnivorous reader, a diligent and earnest student of philosophical literature, and by degrees he developed a power of independent thought and critical judgment of rare penetration and acuteness. Several of those who knew and honoured him feel that an effort should be made to place on record his lifelong labours as an intellectual inquirer, and I have been asked to undertake the task of attempting to gather together the chief results of his philosophical activity. I respond to that request the more readily because I am not without hope that an account of what a ' self-made ' man, immersed in the daily cares and worries of an exacting business occupation, was enabled to accomplish in the field of speculative inquiry may be a help and an inducement to not a few intrepid spirits in our midst who, at the present time, are pursuing the quest of philosophic truth under similar disadvantages and obstacles. Arthur Boutwood was born on August 29, 1864. His parents were in straightened circumstances; and, at the age of thirteen, he had to leave school and earn for himself a livelihood. In 1881 he entered the office of the Charity Commission, where he worked for over forty years as a clerk with a very small salary. At the age of thirty-seven, he married ; and his wife, a lady of considerable literary gifts, became henceforth his constant com- panion and helpmate. They formed a modest home for them? selves in Buckinghamshire, he journeying each day by train to his office in Whitehall. Extremely frugal in his habits, he con- D 49</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES trived, as time went on, to put by a little money; but, on the outbreak of the war, he was the victim of serious financial losses, which made the last years of his life years of deep anxiety. In 1917 he and his wife were compelled to give up the little house that was dear to them and to make their abode in apartments. They met adversity with Stoic courage; but the strain upon his strength must have been wellnigh overwhelming, and he died suddenly at Brighton on June 11, 1924. Boutwood had been brought up a Congregationalist. Almost from childhood he appears to have been deeply interested in the problems of religious belief. As a very young man, he opened, for instance, on several successive Saturday evenings, a series of dis? cussions for working men at the Dovecote Park Schoolroom, Wood Green, on " The Basis of Religion." From the newspaper reports which have been preserved of these Addresses, it is evident that he handled such subjects as the existence of God and the nature of the human soul, and the relation between them, with singular insight and suggestiveness, resting his arguments throughout upon rational grounds, without appeal to scriptural authority. Even at this early period (he could scarcely have been much older than twenty) he is to be found setting forth positions which later, with certain modifications, he was repeatedly striving to sustain?that the divine Being is directly apprehended in and through the moral consciousness, that the human self is an existent entity possessed of thoughts and feelings, and not a mere aggregate of psychical states, and that the gradual development of moral sentiments is explicable, and only explicable, as the self-revelation to men of a perfect and supreme Personality. In course of time, however, Boutwood reached the conviction that the Anglican claims with respect to the tenets of Christian theology were well founded ; and, after 1899, he became an ardent adherent of the Established Church, being later on ordained as a Lay Reader in the Diocese of Southwark. While firmly assured that the Christian revelation was vouchsafed to the world in and through the Incarnation, in the Person and Life of Christ, he was none the less persuaded that the Christian faith required re-statement and adjustment to the characteristic tenden? cies and problems of the present age?a re-statement and adjust? ment which in various books and articles he strove to provide.1 His attitude never ceased to be that of a genuine truth-seeker; he was invariably prepared to acknowledge that to be entitled to credence a belief needed to justify itself at the bar of reason. " The Christian Faith," he writes in 1908, " must always make itself 1 See, for example, his volumes, Is the New Theology Christian ?, London, 1907; and Liberal Theology and the Ground of Faith, London, 1908. He generally wrote under the pseudonym of " Hakluyt Egerton." 50</page><page sequence="3">THE PHILOSOPHY OF A BUSINESS MAN intelligible ; it must always commend itself to the minds of men as a reasonable faith, and it must always be prepared to take up into itself every achievement of thought and every discovery of science." Probably one of the chief turning-points in Boutwood's intel? lectual career was his joining the Aristotelian Society in 1890?the year in which I, too, was elected a member. The meetings were held in those days in the premises of the Royal Asiatic Society in Albemarle Street. We were then a small body, and our gatherings consisted usually of a little group of friends seated round a table in a comfortable room, under the presidency of Shadworth Hodgson. Shadworth Hodgson was a metaphysical thinker of great originality and thoroughness ; it was an education in itself to follow the way in which he would, with expert skill, disentangle the central points in any particular issue that happened to be before us. I think his influence upon Boutwood was considerable, and I am certain that Hodgson had a high opinion of Boutwood's character and ability. Boutwood soon became an exceedingly active member of the Society, and he continued to be a very regular attendant at its meetings until he went to live in the country. He was a Vice- President, and served for many years as Honorary Treasurer. The discussions owed much to his keen and enthusiastic participation in them ; and his comments had the saving merit of not wandering off into side-tracks and irrelevances. Frequently the discussion would be at its height when the closing-time, ten-thirty, arrived; and the President, whose chambers in Conduit Street were not far distant, used to invite us to ad journ to his hospitable study, where a lively exchange of views would be prolonged long past midnight. Boutwood's first paper to the Aristotelian Society, read on December 15, 1890, on " Our Knowledge or Perception of the Ego," was a remarkable performance for a man of twenty-six, who had enjoyed none of the advantages of a University training. In it he propounded the view, already adumbrated in the popular Addresses to which I have alluded, that the ' self ' is a given fact of experience, and not an abstraction conceived by reflexion upon experience. Using the terms ' knowledge ' and ' perception ' as, for the purpose he had in hand, synonymous in meaning, he insisted that in ' knowledge/ as thus understood, we come upon that which for us is ultimate, that we cannot get behind the act of knowing, or show that it has arisen from some other act of knowing. Every such act of knowing implies two terms?a knower and a known?together with a relation between them. It is, he urged, by the establishment of this relation that a specific object becomes known, not by develop? ing the content of any antecedent act of knowing. Each act of perceiving or knowing is, that is to say, primary and unanalysable. And his contention was that of both the terms thus related we can 51</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES assert indubitably ' I know '; in and through the same act subject and object are alike intuitively revealed, and upon the existence of the one we can repose with just as much certainty as upon the existence of the other.1 In short, the knowledge we possess of the ' self ' stands on exactly the same level as the knowledge we possess of a world of things. He did not mean, of course, that our know? ledge of either is exhaustive or immune from error. So far as external things are concerned, we are constrained to admit that we can only know their natures and qualities as they appear to us through the medium of our faculties. When we assert of an external object, given in experience, that it is of a certain size or shape, that it has such and such a colour, and so on, we are asserting of it phenomenal characteristics, which may or may not correspond to its real characteristics. When, however, we assert of it that it exists, and exists independently of our experience of it, we are dealing not with the phenomenal but with the real. For were we here encountering what is hypothetical only, where, he asked, can we be said to meet with fact ? If the distinction between appear? ance and reality is to have for us any significance at all, somewhere we must come upon the bedrock of reality. And, so far as the ' self' is concerned, we are likewise constrained to admit that we can know its nature and qualities only as they appear to us through the medium of introspection. But, however doubtful may be the character of the processes which we call those of cognizing, feeling and willing, it is not doubtful that these processes only occur, so far as we have experience of them, as states or conditions of a conscious subject, and are for us otherwise unthinkable. When, then, we assert of the ' self ' that it exists, and exists as the abiding subject of our changing experiences, we are again making an assertion not of the phenomenal but of the real. Although there is no mention of Thomas Reid in the paper to which I have been referring, the author was probably already acquainted with the writings of the Scotch thinker. Be that, however, as it may, four years subsequently, on February 4, 1895, Boutwood contributed to the Society an able and sympathetic essay on " The Philosophy of Common Sense," which was evidently the outcome of a prolonged and careful study. Reid, he points out, had served a willing period of captivity to Berkeley, and it was not until Hume's Treatise had convinced him of the sceptical conse- 1 Boutwood may, of course, have read, but I hardly think it likely that at this time he had, Ferrier's Institutes of Metaphysics. If he had not, it is a significant fact that, along independent lines, he had virtually reached Ferrier's position that what is known in any act of apprehension is never merely the object, but " always is and must be the object with the addition of oneself?object plus subject, thing or thought mecum." 52</page><page sequence="5">THE PHILOSOPHY OF A BUSINESS MAN quences to which the 'new way of ideas' led that the allegiance was broken. Then, in opposition to the doctrine that in perception we apprehend only ' ideas,' he put forward the view that we have in perception an immediate awareness of external things, and, in defence of this cardinal contention, made his appeal to ' common sense.' Boutwood was anxious to rescue that appeal from what he regarded as crude misconceptions. Whilst allowing that the phraseology employed was often calculated to confuse and mislead, he urged that, in point of fact, Reid did not mean by ' common sense ' the opinion of the crowd, the uncriticized deliverances of the unenlightened understanding. The true significance of Reid's contention comes out, so he argued, in his theory of ' natural judgments ' or ' judgments of nature '?judgments made for us and not by us, and which, in strictness, ought not to have been named ' judgments/ Rather are they primary and fundamental beliefs, the contents of which furnish a body of elementary and ultimate truths, which are prior to all reasoning and the basis upon which the activity of reasoning is alone possible. Such a truth as that of the extra-mental existence of perceived things rests upon a native and spontaneous assurance of the human mind, and it was in attempt? ing to show this that Reid had recourse to the argument from universality of acceptance. His appeal was a direct appeal to the veracious structure of human intelligence, to the trustworthiness of our cognitive faculties. It seemed to Reid, indeed, that in the long run no alternative was open, because in order to criticize those faculties another set of faculties would be requisite, and their testi- mony would have to be accepted on the strength of its own intrinsic evidence. Boutwood made a strong point of insisting that it was not merely on account of the subjective necessity attaching to it that the testimony of our faculties was regarded by Reid as reliable. The certitude they afforded was, according to him, objective certitude ; the witness they bore was pre-eminently a witness to the reality of that which was independent both of the act of knowing and of the mind that knows, the categories of thought were not, in other words, constitutive of reality, in the Kantian sense ; they were interpretive of it; and the reality must first be there in order to be interpreted. In the last resort, that is to say, the basis of all logical necessity is the necessity of fact. Furthermore, Boutwood laid stress upon the consideration that while in Reid's view ' natural judgments' are the fundamental, they are not the only means by which we attain objective certitude. iEsthetic judgments were, for example, instru? ments of similar achievement. So, again, in teleological judgments concerning nature we were gifted with a like genuine insight. But, more especially, the deliverances of the moral consciousness come to us, he held, with an authoritativeness that is a guarantee of their 53</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES objectivity, and therefore throw, in a certain sense, additional light upon the order of the external world, sufficient, at least, to justify the effort after goodness and to warrant the assurance that the structure of nature is such as not to be incompatible with the realiza? tion of ethical ideals. And, finally, we are bidden to note that Reid was by no means oblivious of the fact that human life is a growing and developing life. While he maintained that there are certain gifts of nature which constitute part of the original and essential furniture of the mind, he yet fully recognized that the individual life as a whole is a progressive life. He saw, for example, that in sense-perception the obscurity and vagueness which mark the earlier testimonies gradually give place to clearness and dis- tinctness; he saw, too, that in our powers of reasoning, in our appreciations of beauty, in the sphere of moral discernment, a like advance can be traced. Thus it was to the mature, sane judgment of a man in fullest and closest contact with reality, as corrective of the less authoritative judgment of the immature and untutored, to which Reid, in the end, appealed, and in which he placed his ultimate trust. That early in his philosophical reading he had come across the works of a thinker in which he found a theory of knowledge and of morals in accord with that towards which his own reflexion had been tending was perhaps for Boutwood a fortunate circumstance. It probably saved him from many a wayfaring in the wilderness, and from having to pass through a ' centre of indifference' prior to reaching an intellectual resting-place. But he was essentially an explorer in the world of thought, and was not content to remain within the confines of any one system. An early critical paper of his on " The Philosophy of Rosmini" (contributed to the Aristotelian Society on June 8, 1891) illustrates the extraordinary amount of trouble he would take in order to grasp a metaphysical position on all its sides before venturing to scrutinize the grounds on which it rested. So, again, ten years later, under the title of " A Scientific Monism,"* he was submitting to examination the crude speculation of Ernst Haeckel, but not before he had stated the doctrines with which he was concerned in a perfectly fair and unprejudiced way. Some form of monism is, he maintained, for philosophy inevitable, because the aim of philosophy is to rationally interpret the world, and this can only be done by showing that things are so connected as to preclude the possibility of either an infinite regress or an infinite progress, each of which is unintelligible. Philosophical reflexion cannot, that is to say, stop short of the conception of a systematic, self-subsistent unity. The " monistic conception of the universe " which Haeckel presents as a solution of the " world i Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, N.S. I, 1901, p. 140. 54</page><page sequence="7">THE PHILOSOPHY OF A BUSINESS MAN riddles" belies, however, he contended, its name. Either the atoms of this German scientist's cosmology are purely physical, or else they actually have real souls, and not merely souls ' in a certain sense/ In the former case, his monism breaks down because any derivation of the psychical from the physical is ex hypothesi impossible; in the latter case, it breaks down because particles formed by the local condensation of primitive matter cannot have an intrinsically psychical nature, and, if their psychical nature accrues to them ab extra, that would imply an ultimate dualism. Boutwood was essentially a critic?most of what he published was in the form of criticism?but he was constantly seeking to elicit from his criticism results of a positive kind. In two papers, how? ever, one written in 1902, the last of his contributions to the Aristotelian Society, on " The Philosophy of Probability," and the other written in 1894, on " The Ethical Interpretation of Life and Nature," there are to be discerned, I think, the trends of reflexion underlying the efforts at philosophical construction of his later years. In the former essay, which, I imagine, may to some extent be looked upon as a sort of spiritual autobiography, he shows how the reliance of the ' plain man' upon so-called ' facts' may be shaken by the ' slightest philosophy.' Since it is not immediateness of apprehen? sion, but independence of apprehension that is the ordinary criterion of a ' fact/ the ' plain man ' will be easily brought to concede that not only what is given in perception but also what is known by credible report or by valid inference must be accepted as a ' fact.' Yet his early confidence in this respect will soon begin to waver. He may not doubt that the battle of Hastings was fought in 1066, but he may quite well come to doubt whether water was turned into wine at Cana in Galilee. And, even in regard to sense-perception, more searching analysis will render dubious his erstwhile assurance ; the independent reality of secondary qualities will evince itself as at least open to question. Thus, if the analysis be followed out to the bitter end, he may be stranded in a state of despair of ever finding ' facts' of the kind for which he is in search. If he turn to meta? physics, he will be confronted with the obstacle that there is no way of conclusively demonstrating that the norms of our thinking are likewise conditions of the world of existence. If he turn to physical science, he will have to confess that, so far as it proffers explanation, it is but a cruder metaphysic, and that, so far as it attempts prediction, it rests upon postulates which do not admit of logical proof. What, then, is the ' plain man ' to do ? What, under such circumstances, he actually does do, Boutwood avers, is to revise his conception of ' fact/ Finding himself baffled with questions of ultimate validity, he betakes himself to such reality as he encounters in the world of 55</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES practice. In the natural sciences, in art, in striving after moral goodness, he comes upon that which is serviceable for his daily needs, upon that which enables him to get out of life the things of value which life is capable of yielding. And therein he obtains practical satisfaction or content. But this practical content does not cover the whole of life. The intellect cannot thus be permanently sup- pressed; sooner or later the old problems are bound to recur. Accordingly, Boutwood made it his aim to show that the area of content or satisfaction can be so widened as to meet, up to a certain point, the needs of the intellect. Assuming the principle of the scientific theory of evolution, that living forms maintain themselves in existence in proportion as their relations with the environment are approximately harmonious, to be made out, we seem warranted in concluding that the result of the evolutionary process will not be incongruous with the natural order by which it has been conditioned. Now, thought is no less essentially a part of human nature than practical conduct, and the ideals of thought have come to light along the same course of history as the ideals of morality. If, then, we are justified, on the grounds mentioned, in confiding in the latter, why should we be precluded from confiding in the former ? And, since it is the function of thought to systematize and organize our experience, why may we not expect, by dint of determined reflexion, to interpret the known world as a rational system ? To completely rationalize experience is admittedly beyond us ; but just in so far as we do discover lines or centres of organic unification it would appear that we must be on the right road. Why ? For precisely the same reason, Boutwood would answer, as that on account of which we believe ourselves to be on the right road in pursuing our moral ideals; because of the resulting gain of life. If, therefore, thought is finally driven to form the conception of an absolute, self-subsistent Being, as the ground of the universe, and if the nature of such absolute Being which best accords with the demands of our life and thought be that of a supreme Personality, we have, at least, a strong prima facie case for holding that the theistic concep? tion corresponds to ' fact.' So far, and I think no farther, was Boutwood on purely philo? sophical lines prepared to go. In working out in detail what may be called a philosophy of religion, he called also to his aid arguments of a different kind. The volume which he published in 1908, entitled Liberal Theology and the Ground of Faith, contains one of the most plausible pieces of apologetic for the Anglican position with which I, at any rate, happen to be familiar. In trying to state as concisely and coherently as I can what I take to be the substance of it, I shall, of course, be expressing not my views but his, as, indeed, I have been doing throughout. But, for the time being, I shall endeavour 56</page><page sequence="9">THE PHILOSOPHY OF A BUSINESS MAN to put myself at his standpoint and to bring out the vital points of his reasoning in as clear relief as possible. As we have seen, Boutwood had convinced himself that any con? clusion to be anticipated from philosophical research concerning the being of God could be no more than hypothetical. The ordinary metaphysical attempts to establish the truth of theism seemed to him to break down hopelessly. The Neo-Kantian method of procedure, as worked out, for example, by T. H. Green, evinced itself, on critical inspection, as clearly in valid. The transition from a " spiritual principle in knowledge " to a " spiritual principle in nature " had been made per saltum, and not by legitimate inference. And, even waiving this objection, the method would lead simply to a pantheism, and would yield no ground for conceiving moral ideals to be more than mere ' appearances' due to disabling limitations imposed by the conditions of finite experience. So, too, in following the more strictly Hegelian mode of thought, according to which all finite existents are ' expressions' or ' manifestations ' of the Absolute Idea, we come to an impasse before what Schelling called ' the ugly broad ditch' which separates the timeless Reality from the realm of the temporal. And, even supposing that the chasm could be surmounted, it would still be true that in the realm of ultimate being, as Hegelian writers conceive it, there would be no room for personality. In short, it seemed to Boutwood that, with finite categories and finite notions, it must be for ever impossible for human thought to determine with any approach to certainty the mode of existence of that which reason compels us to contemplate as infinite. None the less, the fact is staring us in the face that the belief in God is wellnigh as widespread as the belief in material things and natural events. If not, strictly speaking, universal, it is, at any rate, sufficiently prevalent to answer every purpose which the appeal to a common experience can legitimately be made to sub- serve. Yet the belief in God, so, at all events, it now appeared to Boutwood,1 differs from the belief in external things in this respect, that God is not immediately apprehended in cognitive experience. An empirical knowledge of the Absolute is, he held, a contradiction in terms. As already indicated, his view was that, leaving aside for the moment supernatural sanctions, ordinary men rest their theistic belief principally, if not solely, on inference from the facts of their moral nature. They find that human life is characteristi? cally inspired by ideals, and that these ideals are regulative of life because they disclose its constitutive character as progressively developing. But these ideals claim to be ' objectively' valid? valid as expressive of a world-order that is not only rational but 1 In this regard his early view had undergone modification. 57</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES moral?and that claim cannot be convincingly sustained either by historical or scientific or philosophical research. Indeed, the facts of experience seem often adverse to it, and these can, at the best, only be favourably construed if assumptions be made which it is beyond our power to verify. Wir heissen euch hoffen was Henry Sidgwick's bequest to the men of his generation. Yes ; but while hope is an indication of the strength of human aspiration, it is not an indication of knowledge, and there is to be got from it no dependable confirmation of the optimistic view of the world which it encourages us to take. Where, then, is the plain unsophisticated consciousness to look for a basis of intellectual security ? Consider, Boutwood would have urged, what alternative it has. It is possible, of course, for the ' plain man ' to remain in a condition of suspense. " We must all of us surely know of cases in which doubt seems to have so penetrated into the inmost spirit of the life as to deprive it alike of intellectual insight and of moral purpose and certitude, and to leave nothing but a vain succession of trivial incident to wear away the lingering years, until the meaningless tale of them is told, and he who, for anything that he knows to the contrary, came out of the nothingness of the past, passes into nothingness again." x In the present stage of civilization, such cases are, however, comparatively rare. And where they do occur, most often the sceptical attitude is confined to the domain of theoretical inquiry, so that we meet not unfrequently the seeming paradox that men who distrust the discursive activity of thought, and who have ceased to anticipate any rational solution of the problems of existence, are yet content to accept what appear to be the practical certainties of the moral consciousness as unquestionable certainties. But if, instead of being the exception, theoretical scepticism should some day become the rule, is it likely that the paradoxical attitude just mentioned would likewise become general ? Is it not, on the contrary, much more likely that the paralysis of doubt would extend in range and empty the experience of right and wrong of its deeper meaning ? And even if it should turn out to be otherwise, even if it should come about that practical moral certitude held its own in spite of the prevailing scepticism of the vast majority of individuals, can it be said that a race of men to whom the world seems dark and silent, unillumined by any ray of interpreting light, whether human or divine, and unresponsive to the eager questionings of intelligence, is a culmination of human evolution in any sense capable of being described as a survival of the fittest ? If what Watson calls (the great misgiving' were to become universal, would it be indicative of human progress or of human decadence ? 1 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Vol. II, No. 3, 1894, p. 80. 58</page><page sequence="11">THE PHILOSOPHY OF A BUSINESS MAN Ah, to know not, while with friends I sit, And while the purple joy is passed about, Whether 'tis ampler day divinelier lit Or homeless night without; And whether, stepping forth, my soul shall see New prospects, or fall sheer?a blinded thing! There is, O grave, thy hourly victory, And there, O death, thy sting. But now, having contemplated that prospect, let us, Boutwood urged in effect, have regard to a different set of considerations. Let us, namely, for the sake of argument, assume that, however attained, the ordinary conception of God prevalent among civilized peoples?the conception of a supreme Personality, at once the Creator of the universe and the Sustainer of its order and regularity, at once the ultimate source of our ideals and the pledge of their validity?is substantially a true conception. Then it is not difficult to show that the orthodox doctrine of a supernatural revelation at a particular epoch of human history is a perfectly intelligible and a consistent consequence of that assumption. The historical situation was this : Through the labour of countless ages man had succeeded in subduing the earth to his needs, in rendering it tenantable. Gradually it became no longer strange to him, no longer inveterately hostile. He had to some extent explored its recesses, where aforetime monstrous dangers were supposed to lurk, and had found them empty; by degrees he began to walk securely where his remoter ancestors had trembled. He had established himself in the world, and had in large measure converted it into a human home. And correlatively with this attainment of mastery over nature, and with the formation of national and social communities, he had acquired the thought of God as the loving Father of his human children, and for centuries that thought had been as natural to him as the thought of the morrow's sunrise. But, with the development of the rational powers, the time came when, in a crude form at first, the human mind began to frame speculative questions. Was, after all, this earthly environment the sort of environment a supreme and loving Being would have designed for spirits kindred with himself ? Was the life of goodness so clearly imperative, seeing that unrighteous- ness frequently proved to be profitable, and whole classes of persons groaned beneath the burden of prosperous wrong-doing ? And, if death hurries away our brief generations into what looks like destruction, is it really true that the life of moral endeavour is pref erable to that of selfish indulgence and aggrandisement ? When once questions such as these came to be pondered over, the human intellect had entered upon the stage of putting problems to itself which an Omniscient Mind would know the unaided human intellect was debarred from ever being able finally to solve. Only by some 59</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES special disclosure of the nature of Reality could questions such as these be definitely answered. Only from God himself, from some exceptional manifestation of his character directly determined to meet human needs, could these doubts be allayed. In short, the information could come only by revelation; and, if it was to come, the informing revelation would have to be mediated by miracle. To argue that the conception of an intervening God is an unworthy conception of deity appeared to Boutwood to betray gross misunderstanding. It is senseless to insist that the notion of a miracle-working deity is cruder and more anthropomorphic than the notion of a Mind that completely accomplishes its purposes by undeviating law, because it is implied in the very hypothesis on which we are proceeding that what, in this connexion, can be accomplished by miracle cannot, under any circumstances, be accomplished by undeviating law. If it be true that finite thought is, in virtue of its finitude, debarred from attaining in regard to the universe as a whole that certitude which a Mind stationed at the centre of things must possess, it is manifestly absurd to demand even of Omnipotence that it should both bring forth finite individuals into existence and endow them with powers inconsistent with their finitude. Boutwood admitted that, interpreted in a certain way, the principle of the uniformity of nature does exclude the conception of divine intervention. But, he insisted, this is not so if the principle be interpreted in the manner in which we are alone justified in interpreting it. He would have it noted, at the outset, that the principle of uniformity is not a demonstrated fact, but a working hypothesis, which the scientific man takes for granted in his pro? cedure and uses as the basis of scientific prediction. Scientific laws are not self-sufficing entities that govern the universe ; they are but formulae which express the ways in which things act. The action of a thing results partially from the thing's nature ; the thing acts in a certain way so long as it remains what it is and does not change into something else. And this invariableness of action is what is really meant by uniformity. While, then, ' laws' point to modes of action,' uniformity ' points to invarkbility of action?an invaria- bility which again is dependent upon a certain permanence in the constitution of natural substances. Things are assumed, in other words, to be of a perduring nature ; each is regarded as continuing to be what it is known to be, unless and until the natural sequence of physical events brings it into new relations which give it a new empirical character, relations which induce in it, or have as their correlate, new modes of action and reaction. In all this, there is no implication that nature is a self-acting system, summed up and complete in itself. On the contrary, the principle of uniformity is 60</page><page sequence="13">THE PHILOSOPHY OF A BUSINESS MAN perfectly consistent with the theistic belief that natural processes are directed and sustained by a divine will. The question is, can it likewise be said to be consistent with the belief that nature is dependent upon a Will which is occasionally intervening and inter- rupting ? No, answers Boutwood, not if you persist in taking for granted that the ' uniformity ' is absolutely universal and inviolable. That, however, is just exactly what you have no scientific warrant for doing. You may argue, indeed, that if once the possibility of miracles be conceded, the certainty of scientific prediction would be undermined. And that would be a potent argument against the contention that miracles are taking place frequently and everywhere. But it loses its potency when advanced against the contention that a few very important miracles have taken place on certain very rare occasions. It will then seem to retain it only if there be surrep- titiously introduced the fictitious notion of ' law' as a coercive force, constraining events from the outside, and the scientific hypothesis of 'uniformity' be erroneously supposed to be such a 'law/ Accordingly, in the long run, the one question which really goes to the root of the matter is this : Is it reasonable to believe that the Will of God has sometimes been specially and directly deter? mined to an end not secured by those perduring determinations of his Will which direct and sustain the ordinary processes of nature ? And, on the grounds already indicated, Boutwood's answer was that it certainly is reasonable. He recognized, of course, that having established, as he conceived, the credibility of a miraculous revelation, such as is alleged to have occurred at the beginning of the Christian era, wre need still to be convinced that the evidence we possess is sufficient to substantiate the claim that the revelation was in fact an historic occurrence. Boutwood had, I take it, satisfied himself concerning the authenticity of the chief New Testament documents, although he allowed to the full that it was the business of a ' sufficiently equipped criticism' to investigate the trustworthiness of the Scripture records. He felt himself under no compulsion towards Bibliolatry, and he explicitly rejected the Protestant theory of verbal inspiration. His belief in the primary Christian miracles, the Incarnation and the Resurrection, was, he insisted, the result of no narrow piece of inference from Biblical texts, but of everything that makes men Christian. Speculative thought receives from the hands of competent criticism the account of the miraculous episodes in Palestine. These are constituents of its explicandum, but it does not receive them as isolated events. They are inseparably connected with the life of Christ, with his character and avowed vocation, and with the whole body of subsequent Christian experience. This ' relatedness' is part of their historical reality, part of the reality 61</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES which speculative thought is called upon to interpret. The Christian Church grew out of the evangelical history, and throughout the Christian ages its central function has been to perpetuate the witness of the Incarnate Life, and to make that witness effectual in the lives of men. Its witness has been a witness to a history charged with metaphysical meaning; but the instruments by which it has fulfilled this function have been largely ethical. By its character? istic discipline of life, by its mode of forming character, it has prepared individuals to receive its witness; and after nineteen centuries it still revives in its members the faith of the early disciples, to whom the Word of Life was immediately present. The Church has been, then, an organism in which the experiment of testing the truth of the Christian philosophy of history has been effectively carried out. Hence it may legitimately be said to have authority? not authority coming to us with a crude claim to servile obedience, but authority which animates the mind daily renewed and the life informed by a new purpose, transmuted by a new strength, and which, on account of what it thus achieves, constrains men to make its affirmations their affirmations. " The acknowledgment of God in Christ accepted by their reason " solves for them not indeed " all questions in the world and out of it," but the basal questions which, without it, they could not solve. I have dealt at length with Boutwood's philosophy of religion because I believe it would have been this trend of his reflexion upon which he himself would have laid the greatest stress. But an account of his work would be incomplete without a reference to his thoughtful volume on political theory,1 which supplements in certain respects the views propounded in the book to which I have been referring, and which certainly deserves to be more widely known than it is. In this volume he developed, in a lucid and interesting manner, the conception of the nation as a moral organism, and made use of that conception in order to throw light upon a number of practical problems. One of the merits of his treatment consists in the care with which he brought out the difference in the significance of the term " organism " when that term is applied to an individual man and when it is applied to a social community. In the latter case, he pointed out, we have to do with a discrele and not with a concrete organism. As a member of a political organism, each individual is a participant in a common life which is sovereign in him, but the particular end of his own individual life is for him also sovereign. And these two ends find reconciliation in and through the moral ideal, the ideal, namely, of a manhood made perfect in and through 1 Patriotism. An Essay towards a Constructive Theory of Politics.

But, as against such theories as that of a ' general will' embodied more or less perfectly in ' the State,' regarded as an independent entity, Boutwood maintained that the nation is no more separable from the individuals who constitute it than the psychical modifi? cations of a conscious subject are separable from that conscious subject. Indeed, even this analogy is in so far defective as that the dependence is in the reverse order. Whereas the psychical modifica? tion has actuality only in the personal self which it momentarily makes manifest, a nation has actuality only in its constituent individuals. Throughout, the main principle accentuated is that the social life is but an aspect of individual life, and that all social institutions?the monarchy, Parliament, the family, the Church, trades-unions, etc.?have no other reality and no other ground. It is not, therefore, surprising to find the author strenuously empha- sizing the view that the true national ideal, the true goal of an enlightened democracy, would be a condition of social being wherein each man (implying, of course, by this term both sexes) had full opportunity of living out his own life according to the full measure of the manhood that is his?unfettered by usage or custom, un- hindered by ignorance or selfishness, whether around him or within him, unimpeded by those class-privileges and industrial organizations which make one life tributary to another. The national ideal is, then, essentially an ethical ideal; the nation is primarily an instru? ment for the furtherance of individual lives, and has ethical value only as such. Personal liberty, the necessary expression of man's moral autonomy?that it is which the nation as an organism subsists to promote. Naturally, he was concerned to show that the universality of the moral ideal does not involve the elimination of individual differences, but implies rather that the infinite diversity in human character and capability should be frankly recognized and respect ed. No man, he insisted, is ever precisely like another. Not only has he a distinctive present nature and capacity peculiar to himself, but the line of his spiritual advance, marked out for him by possibilities as yet undeveloped, is no less distinctive and unique. And that society is highest in the scale of social evolution in which wearisome and unhelpful monotony of life is reduced to a minimum. He knew, indeed, how much of change there must needs be, even in our most advanced communities, before that ideal had any hope of realization. " There are," he wrote, " worse and more poignant evils in life than a compelled service of overtaxing labour. It is worse to spend the years of opening manhood, when new capacities and new ideals are urgent within one, tied down to a trivial and perfunctory routine prescribed and governed by crude and clumsy 63</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES precedents that leave no room for individual initiative?tied down to routine that dooms half one's days to an idleness that must perforce disguise itself as industry?to a routine that awakens no interest, that entails no responsibility worthy to be mentioned by a man, that makes no demand upon a man's powers of judgment aiid of work, and is serviceable only to the incapacity of those who, by supervising it, set themselves above ' the ordinary of nature's workmanship' in pretentious and paltry dignity?serviceable only to small men in small places, whose ignorance is a daily provocation, whose thriving incompetence is a bitter mockery of Life's most earnest hopes. In this hopeless bondage of the spirit I have spent more years than I care to count, and yet I do not deem those years wholly wasted. They have cleared my mind of much superstition, and have taught one, among other things, the invaluable lesson of the pricelessness of reasonable liberty?of that liberty through which work becomes an interest genuinely humanizing, an activity genuinely worthy of manhood." 64</page></plain_text>
