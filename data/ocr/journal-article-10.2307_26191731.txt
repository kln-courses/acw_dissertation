<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> MICHIKO KANEKO AND JOHANNA MESCH Eye Gaze in Creative  Sign Language Abstract This article discusses the role of eye gaze in creative sign language.  Because eye gaze conveys various types of linguistic and poetic in- formation, it is an intrinsic part of sign language linguistics in general  and of creative signing in particular. We discuss various functions of  eyegaze in poetic signing and propose a classification of gaze behav- iors based on the observation of a number of poems in British Sign  Language and Swedish Sign Language. Creative sign language is the use of sign language for  artistic purposes. It differs from everyday signing in that both the  form and the content are foregrounded and therefore crucial to one’s  understanding of the overall message. In other words, how one says  something is as significant as what one says. Eye gaze plays a crucial  role in this presentational aspect of sign language poetry, while manual  signing builds the basic storyline of a poem. The same content can be  delivered in completely different ways depending on a subtle variation  in the performer’s gaze behavior. In this sense, in eye gaze, “text and  performance overlap” (Sutton-Spence 2005, 136). In this article we highlight the ways in which eye gaze contributes  to the delivery of sign language poetry.1 The first half of the article we  discuss a variety of functions of eye gaze in general. In the second half  we propose a possible categorization of gaze patterns in creative signing. We draw mainly on two recent collections of poems in British Sign  Language (BSL) and Swedish Sign Language (SSL). The anthology of  BSL poetry has been created as part of a research project on metaphor  in creative sign language at the University of Bristol, funded by the  Michiko Kaneko was a research associate at the University of Bristol (UK) when  this article was written. Now she is a lecturer in sign language at University of the  Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.

The SSL poems are available  on a DVD titled “Tio teckenspråkskonstnärer” (Ten Sign Language  Artists).2 The poems by Dorothy Miles and Wim Emmerik are avail- able at the webpage of the ECHO project (European  Cultural Heri- tage Online, http://sign-lang.ruhosting.nl/echo/). All of the  poems  were composed and performed by Deaf people.3 Although we discuss poems in different sign languages, this is not  a cross-linguistics article. It is not our aim to compare poems in BSL  and SSL. General Functions of Eye Gaze Eye gaze is an indispensable part of the linguistics of sign languages. As  Bahan and Supalla (1995, 179) point out, the eye gaze behaviors in sign  languages are “linguistic in nature.” Space does not permit us to explore  the linguistic aspects of eye gaze in detail, but, for example, Sutton- Spence and Woll (1999) list six linguistic functions of eye gaze in BSL: 1.  to mark a lexical contrast (such as boss and god, which are mini- mal pairs since they differ only in the direction of eye gaze) 2.  to point at a referent or trace its movement 3. to indicate a role shift  4. t o distinguish genuine questions from pseudoquestions 5. to indicate turn taking in dialogues 6.  to convey temporal information (e.g., when signers talk about past  events, they tend to look sideways, while a straight or downward  gaze indicates present events, and an upward gaze indicates future  events.) Of these six functions, pointing and tracing referents, role shift, turn  taking, and temporal information are highly relevant to poetic signing.  Apart from these linguistic functions, eye gaze has additional func- tions that are unique to artistic signing. In what follows, we discuss  some of these in relation to sign language poetry. Show How the Poet Is Involved in the Poem First of all, eye gaze reveals the different ways in which poets are  involved in their signing. For example, they often look straight into  </page> <page sequence="3"> 374 | Sign Language Studie s the audience, acknowledging its presence. In this case the poets  exist  outside the story, which allows them to explain or comment on their  creative work. In contrast, the poet’s eyes can be understood to be  those of a character within the poem. In this case the poet is no lon- ger addressing the audience but is completely immersed in the story  world. The poets can also glance at their hands or various points in  the signing space, in which case their gaze serves to spotlight particu- lar signs or locations. Figure 1 shows different gaze behaviors of the  same BSL poet (Richard Carter), each of which produces a different  impression: (a) the poet gazes at the audience; (b) the poet imitates  the gaze of a caterpillar emerging from an apple; (c) the poet gazes  at his hand. The degree and the type of involvement vary according to the  style of the individual poet. Some poets maintain eye contact with the  audience throughout the performance, whereas others prefer not to.  They also depend on the type of poem being presented. For narrative- based poems, the poet often adopts a subjective perspective (as either  a narrator or a character) through eye gaze. In more artistic poems  (like some of the signed haiku, which are characterized by brevity and  objectivity), the poet’s personal and emotional investment is reduced,  and the gaze is used simply to highlight manual signs (Kaneko 2008).  In addition, the poet’s involvement depends on the performance situa- tion. For example, signing to a live audience or to a camera influences  the performer’s gaze behavior in dissimilar ways (Krentz 2006). Highlight and Reinforce Manual Signs One of the central issues of gaze behavior is its relationship to manual  signs. Eye gaze can be either dependent on or independent of manual  Figure 1. Different gaze behaviors. </page> <page sequence="4"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 375 signs. In the former case, eye gaze is directed toward the hands and  follows whatever path they take. A particular sign or a sequence of  signs produced by the hands is reinforced by the gaze following them.  Such use of eye gaze is frequently deviant and is not commonly found  in everyday signing (Sutton-Spence 2005). In everyday conversation,  signers usually look at their interlocutors. In artistic signing, a gaze  directed at the hands occurs much more frequently. There it is used to  highlight the configuration of the sign and to put “poetic expression  on display” (Ormsby 1995, 240). For example, Juli af Klintberg’s “Mitt” (“My”) contains a sequence  in which the poet outlines a ridge and then depicts an arc of arrows  shot across the hill (figure 2). Both actions are repeated several times  (suggesting a range of hills and several shots of arrows). Each time the  poet’s gaze follows the movement of her hands, thereby emphasizing  the shape of the hills and the path of the arrows. Provide Additional Information to Complement Manual Signs Eye gaze can support manual signs by providing different but comple- mentary information about what the hands are doing. Instead of fol- lowing and highlighting the manual signs, the gaze projects a different  angle to illustrate the same event. For example, in Paul Scott’s “Too  Busy to See, No Time to Hug,” the poet illustrates a tall mountain.  While his hands outline the mountain (as in the example of the hill  in figure 2), his gaze is fixed at an upper area that corresponds to the  summit of the mountain (figure 3). Manual signs alone can describe  the mountain, of course, but the poet uses his gaze to emphasize the  height of the mountain in a different manner. Figure 2. Gaze following the signs hi ll and arrow in Juli af Klintberg’s “Mitt.” </page> <page sequence="5"> 376 | Sign Language Studie s Figure 3. Gaze pattern in Paul Scott’s “Too Busy to See, No Time to Hug.” Such gaze behavior can also add stability to the creation of a  poetic scene. Because they need to move to keep the story going,  the hands are continuously in motion. Eye gaze, although it is often  momentary as well, can also be fixed on a certain location for a much  longer time than manual signs. It complements manual signs by re- taining the most salient part of the information for the duration of  the corresponding hand movements. This is considered a “pegging”  function of eye gaze. Reflect on Manual Signs Poets sometimes look at their hands as if pondering what they are  signing. Manual signs convey the basic story line of a poem, so by  looking at their hands poets are analyzing what is happening in the  poem and/or highlighting the particular way a sign is produced. In Donna Williams’s “Who Am I? the poet is labeled as “hearing  impaired” by the mainstream hearing community. After the poet signs  hearing impaired with a straight frontal gaze (figure 4a), she re- peats the sign impaired while looking at her hands (figure 4b). By  doing this, she highlights the configuration of the sign and its negative  impact on the viewer (by illustrating the act of crushing or smashing  something). The form of the sign is identical to that of damaged, and  the poet actually mouths “damaged” while signing it for the second  time, as if asking, “What do you mean, I’m ‘damaged’?” </page> <page sequence="6"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 377  a. (hearing) impaired b. damaged? Figure 4. Different gaze behaviors in Donna Williams’s “Who Am I?” Guide the Audience Smoothly during Transitions between Signs Unlike spontaneous signing, signed poems often have structured  pauses and transitions. Eye gaze contributes to a smooth transition by  filling the gap caused by the halt of manual signs. During the pause  the gaze can be used to reflect on the development of the story so  far and link it to the next scene. Donna Williams’s “Who Am I?,” which we have just discussed, il- lustrates the process in which the poet examines her mixed identity. At  one point she “takes out” different aspects of her identity from inside  her (e.g., Deaf, woman, gay), which are metaphorically understood as  tangible objects, and lay them out one by one in front of her (figure  5a). Then she pauses and looks at these attributes (figures 5b and 5c).   a. b. c. Figure 5. Gaze during the transition in Donna Williams’s “Who Am I?” </page> <page sequence="7"> 378 | Sign Language Studie s Figure 6. Gaze during the transition in John Wilson’s “Winter.” It is during this pause that the poet begins to accept and embrace her  complex identity. No manual signs are used, but the gaze, in conjunc- tion with the reassuring nods, manages the transition smoothly. John Wilson’s “Winter” is a brief haiku that illustrates the contrast  between the seasons (figure 6). In the first half of the poem, the poet  describes a picture of summer, hung on the wall to the right of the  poet. The poet continues looking at the picture even after he has  finished signing. This prolonged gaze marks the end of the first part.  Then his gaze slowly moves from right to left, carrying the audience  to the next scene, where he signs snowflake, which represents  winter, the real season of the poem. Eye gaze during this transition  reflects on the previous sequence and foretells the next scene, while  connecting the right and left spaces, summer and winter, the picture  and the reality. Extend the Poetic Scene beyond the Signing Space The articulators (hands, face, body) cannot leave the body to reach out  for something located elsewhere. It is not very common, at least in the  tradition of BSL and SSL poetry, for the poet to move around on the  stage. Their feet usually stay in one place, and the poem is delivered  within the normal signing space.  Eye gaze is one of the very few ways to physically refer to remote  referents without creating “visual noise,” which, by moving and ex- tending other body parts, would be a problem. When the poet looks  away from the immediate surroundings, that gaze can extend the  poetic scene. This helps to lay out a broad, open space in front of the  </page> <page sequence="8"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 379  a. b. Figure 7. Examples of extensive gaze. poet. For example, in figure 7a the poet is illustrating a range of hills,  but her gaze is directed beyond the manual signs to add depth. Figure  7b shows the moment when the protagonists come out of a thick  forest to an open area at the foot of a mountain. This broad view is  expressed by the poet’s far-reaching gaze. A far-reaching gaze is often used at the end of a poem for a pro- longed poetic effect. Johanna Mesch’s “Aeroplane” illustrates a plane  crash. At the end of the poem, the soul of the wrecked plane is called  up to the heavens. During this sequence, the poet’s gaze first follows  the hand (which represents the plane) as it moves upward, but the poet  keeps looking upward even after her hand stops moving (figure 8).  This provides a solemn, lingering effect as the audience continues to  “see” the plane’s ascent as the poem ends. Figure 8. Upward gaze from Johanna Mesch’s “Aeroplane.” </page> <page sequence="9"> 380 | Sign Language Studie s Refer to Nonpresent Referents Because most referents do not exist in the poet’s immediate physical  surroundings, the poet needs to make them “visible.” Of course, they  can be represented by manual signs, but they can also be introduced  by the poet’s eyes, directed at them. In other words, eye gaze confirms  the presence of invisible referents. Such referents can be identified  by the context (either preceding or following), or they can remain  unspecified and left to the interpretation of the viewer. In Paul Scott’s “Tree,” the presence of the tree is often expressed  solely by eye gaze. Various people and animals pass by the tree and  look up to their left, where the tree is understood to exist (except for  the blind person, who does not see the tree but touches it instead).  The reference to the tree has already been established in the story,  so the audience knows that the characters are looking at it. Figure 9  shows a man who finds the tree and is overwhelmed by how tall it has  grown. His gaze informs you not only of the presence and location  of the tree but also of its height, as the poet traces the invisible tree  up and down several times. The target of the gaze can remain unspecified. In Paul Scott’s haiku  “Old Age,” the poet portrays an old man with his walking stick, who  suddenly looks up to his right in horror (figure 10). It is not exactly  clear to the audience what he sees. It can be interpreted as “Death”  approaching the old man, who tries to avert its coming, but the in- terpretation is open to other possibilities. Figure 9. Gaze to the tree in Paul Scott’s “Tree.” </page> <page sequence="10"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 381 Figure 10. Gaze to an unspecified referent in Paul Scott’s “Old Age.” Develop the Story by Itself in the Absence of Manual Signs In some cases, eye gaze can even develop the story by itself, that is,  without the accompaniment of manual signs. Paul Scott’s “Too Busy  to Hug, No Time to See” is a story about a mountain and the sea.  Toward the end of the story, the mountain looks to its left, realizes that  the sun is setting, and makes a face because it will soon be getting dark  and cold. Then the mountain looks down to get the sea’s attention and  jerks its gaze toward the sun as if to say “Hey, look!” (figure 11). All  of this is done nonmanually. The gaze direction in particular conveys  the crucial information about this scene. Figure 10. Gaze in Paul Scott’s “Too Busy to Hug, No Time to See.” </page> <page sequence="11"> 382 | Sign Language Studie s Figure 12. A nonmanual sequence from John Wilson’s “Lift.” Another notable example of the gaze developing the story by  itself appears in John Wilson’s haiku “Lift.” Almost the entire poem  is told through the eyes of a personified elevator, which is eager to  carry passengers up and down but is disappointed as no one wants to  use it (figure 12). Manual signs are present (representing the elevator  doors), but they remain inactive throughout most part of the poem.  The elevator’s expectant gaze, together with its lively facial expres- sions, provides great deal of affective information and humorous effect. Add Metaphorical Values to the Poem Eye gaze is often involved with the metaphorical interpretation of the  theme of a poem. First of all, the direction of the gaze can function  as an orientational metaphor, in which our values are conceptual- ized through spatial orientation (e.g., “up” is often associated with  positive concepts) (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). For example, because  of the poet’s upward gaze at the end of the poem, Johanna Mesch’s  “Aeroplane,” discussed earlier, leaves a positive aftertaste despite the  sad nature of the subject. Gaze direction also shows power relationships. Deaf people as a  cultural/linguistic minority often need to look “up” to the mainstream  hearing people. In sign language poetry, eye gaze is symbolically used  to refer to such situations. For example, in Donna William’s “That  Day,” a patronizing hearing person looks “down” at the Deaf poet,  and the poet looks “up” as she returns a sarcastic smile to the hearing  person (figure 13). Ormsby (1995) and Bauman (2003) report a similar  use of gaze symbolism in American Sign Language poetry. Finally, the act of looking itself has the power to metaphorically  change the meaning of a manual sign. Often eye gaze is used to figu- ratively turn concepts into “visible” objects. For example,  Dorothy  </page> <page sequence="12"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 383 Figure 13. The gaze of the patronizing hearing person (left) and the poet returning  her gaze (right) in Donna Williams’s “That Day.” Miles’s “Evening (Trio)” contains a simile, “Darkness, like a bat, flies  close.” This is a sophisticated association because darkness and bat  are not only conceptually but also formally connected (i.e., their con- figurations are similar). What triggers this simile, however, is a shift  in gaze. As the poet signs darkness, she does not look at her hands  (figure 14a). Then she casts her gaze toward her hands, thereby turn- ing the darkness into a bat without changing the hand configuration  (figure 14b). The gaze makes the hands “visible” and instantiates a  symbolic transformation.  a. b. Figure 14. A gaze shift in Dorothy Miles’s “Evening.” </page> <page sequence="13"> 384 | Sign Language Studie s Classification of Gaze Patterns Since the 1990s various researchers have looked into different gaze  patterns in creative signing. Bahan and Supalla (1995) and Engberg- Pedersen (1999) investigated the patterns of eye gaze in sign language  narratives, based on the direction and function of the gaze. They came  up with similar classifications:  1. gaze toward audience  2. character’s gaze  3. gaze at hands (Bahan and Supalla 1995) 1. sender’s eye contact with the receiver (= 1 above)  2. imitative eye gaze (= 2 above)  3. configurational eye gaze (= 3 above)  4. sender’s reference-tracking eye gaze (Engberg-Pedersen 1999) Both classifications distinguish gaze according to its direction (e.g.,  toward the audience [1] or the hands [3]) and the role/function of  the poet (e.g., taking a particular character’s viewpoint [2]). Engberg- Pedersen adds one more type (4), in which the poet glances at a  certain place to refer to something.  These two categorizations are relatively simple and work adequate- ly with narratives. However, gaze behavior in poetry is more complex  and thus needs a more detailed explanation. This is mainly because,  in narratives and dialogues, the primary purpose is communication.  For example, signers constantly look at the audience or enact certain  characters to keep the audience’s attention and make the story easy  to follow. In poetry, however, the main purpose of signing is aesthetic  pleasure (i.e., the sheer enjoyment of linguistic beauty). Communica- tive intent is reduced, resulting in a wider variation in gaze patterns  that no single criterion is capable of explaining.  We consider following seven criteria in order to classify the gaze  patterns in sign language poetry: 1.  direction of the gaze  • gaze toward the audience (or camera)   •  gaze toward the hands (including a gaze that precedes or   follows the hands) </page> <page sequence="14"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 385 • gaze toward specified/unspecified referents • gaze at a point in the signing space 2. poet’s role Since poet can take on different roles, eye gaze is used to clarify  which role the poet is performing at a particular moment. Some  of these roles are as follows: • narrator  • character • observer  • poetic tool  3. function of the gaze As already discussed, eye gaze fulfills various functions. It can ex- plain or comment on a story by doing the following: • directly showing the story world through the character’s eyes • highlighting particular signs • reflecting on particular signs • hinting at the upcoming sequence 4. e xtra- or intradiegesis (whether the gaze is external or internal,  respectively, to the story) In a sign language poem, a diegesis reveals whether something  is happening within the story world (Prince 2003). Diegesis was  originally developed to account for the use of music in movies.  When a character in a film is playing an instrument or listening  to music, the music is intradiegetic (i.e., part of the story); when  the music is added at the time of editing for the sake of creating  an effect and thus is not heard by the characters, it is extradiegetic.  Similarly, a poet’s gaze is intradiegetic when it takes place within  the story (e.g., when a character is looking at something). When  the poet comes out of the story by acknowledging the audience,  it is extradiegetic. 5. display of personality Eye gaze can also be used to reveal personality (e.g., the personal,  emotional, or subjective viewpoint of a human being). The same  gaze can be interpreted differently, depending on whether it in- volves emotion and intention on the part of the looker or is simply  used as an articulator to fulfill a linguistic function (e.g., agreement  marking). The eyes are understood to be those of a person in the  </page> <page sequence="15"> 386 | Sign Language Studie s former case (usually with facial expressions), whereas in the latter  case the act of seeing itself is no longer significant.  6. relation to manual signs As pointed out earlier, the relation between the gaze and the hands  is crucial in understanding gaze behavior. The gaze can be inde- pendent of or dependent on manual signs; it can follow or precede  them; and it supports or reacts to what the hands are doing.  7. omniscience of the poet It goes without saying that poets in the real world know what they  are doing. They are the makers of their fictional world and thus  complete control over the development of the story, its characters,  and so on. However, they can also feign ignorance and pretend  that they do not know anything about such matters. Eye gaze can  reveal whether the poet is omniscient or ignorant. If the gaze is  omniscient, the gaze can precede manual signs and/or hint at what  is going to happen next. When the gaze is ignorant, it normally  follows and reacts to manual signs. Considering these different aspects of gaze features, we propose the  following six categories. Gaze toward the Audience The poet’s gaze can be directed toward either a live audience or an  imagined one (e.g., behind a camera). Dorothy Miles emphasizes the  importance of maintaining eye contact with the audience:  Do not become so engrossed in your images that you ignore the  audience. Glance at the audience from time to time to emphasize an  image or event, to indicate a pause or change of image, and especially  to convey an emotion or ask a question or make a direct statement.  (unpublished notes in 1991, cited in Sutton-Spence 2005, 136; em- phasis in the original)  By looking at the audience, poets can create intimacy with the audi- ence and blur the boundary between the fiction and the reality to  make the narrative more familiar or convincing. With a live audience,  they can also see whether the audience is understanding what they  are saying and make adjustments if necessary. This happens in less  structured, more casual story-based poems. </page> <page sequence="16"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 387 In this type of gaze, the poet functions as a narrator. “Unlike a  speaker telling a story, a signing storyteller is not able to gaze away  from the audience and still narrate” (Bahan and Supalla 1995, 178). As  a narrator, the poet can explain or comment on the story (not neces- sarily verbally but through facial expressions). While they are narrating,  the poets exist outside the story world (thus the gaze is extradiegetic),  and the gaze is that of the poet; the personality and emotion expressed  through facial expressions also belong to the poet. With the poet act- ing as an all-seeing narrator, the gaze is omniscient. Certain types of signs are likely to be accompanied by a gaze to- ward the audience: Titles are often signed with the poet’s gaze fixed on the audience or  camera. This is not only because the poet needs to establish an initial  connection with the audience but also because the titles are outside  the story, so the external gaze is appropriate. An established lexicon also tends to be accompanied by a gaze toward  the audience. The lexicon explains or sets up the background, which  is compatible with the function of a gaze toward the audience. More- over, because they are conventionalized signs, the forms of the items  in the established lexicon do not need to be foregrounded by the  gaze. This is in contrast to productive signs, whose forms (which are  highly visual and creative) are often highlighted by a gaze at the hands. Key words are also signed with a gaze toward the audience. The  poet looks straight at the audience in order to emphasize something.  There are abundant examples of the gaze toward the audience.  In ÅsaMy Bjurling’s “Arv,” the poet, holding a baby in her arm, sud- denly shifts her gaze toward the audience and says, “Who is this? It’s  my son” (figure 15). In Wim Emmerik’s haiku “Falling Leaf ” (in Dutch Sign Lan- guage), the poet avoids eye contact with the members of the audi- ence throughout the poem but glances at them just once—at the very  end. The poem is filled with visual images of a falling leaf, which are  foregrounded by the poet’s gaze at the hands (an example of “spotlight  gaze,” which we discuss later). The last sign, however, is an established  sign, purple, which represents a concept that cannot be visually ex- pressed in sign languages. At this point, the poet comes “out” of the  </page> <page sequence="17"> 388 | Sign Language Studie s  holding-baby who-is-this? son Figure 15. The gaze to the audience in ÅsaMy Bjurling’s “Arv.” poetic scene by fixing his gaze on the camera and remarking that the  leaf is purple (the last sign in figure 16). This is also the concluding  remark of this poem, which the shift in the gaze pattern emphasizes. Character’s Gaze The “character’s gaze” refers to “seeing the story-world through the  eyes of the character” (Bahan and Supalla 1995, 179). Its main func- tion is to directly show a poetic scene through the actions and emo- tions of a character. The signer steps into the role of a character, and  the signer’s eyes become those of the character. The direction of the  gaze varies, depending on where that particular character is looking.  In many examples not only the signer’s eyes but also the hands and/ or the body represent the character. The poet is fully involved in the  story (therefore abandoning the omniscient power of the poet as the  narrator), making the gaze intradiegetic. The gaze displays the char- acter’s personality through facial expressions. By presenting the story  through the eyes of a character, the poet can create strong empathy  with an audience.  Figure 16. Gaze behaviors in Wim Emmerik “Falling Leaf.” </page> <page sequence="18"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 389 Figure 17. Examples of character’s gaze. Figure 17 shows some examples of a character’s gaze: the poet in  the role of a female school teacher (a); of a tiger (b); and of a (personi- fied) book being opened (c). As figure 17 illustrates, characters can be humans, animals, or in- animate objects that are personified by means of the poet’s body. The  anthropomorphism of nonhuman objects is an intrinsic part of sign  language poetry (Sutton-Spence and Napoli 2010). A character’s eye  gaze contributes hugely to the poetic effect of such anthropomor- phism. For example, in Paul Scott’s “Doll,” the poet enacts the charac- ter of the protagonist (presumably a young girl) and her doll through  eye gaze and tells a story from each one’s viewpoint. The doll’s gaze  is especially effective as it introduces a completely new and comical  perspective to the story, such as when the girl tries to draw eyebrows  on the doll’s face (figure 18). Figure 18. The gaze of the girl (left) and of the doll (right) in Paul Scott’s “Doll.” </page> <page sequence="19"> 390 | Sign Language Studie s Poetic-I. In sign language poetry, it is very common for the poet to  represent a subjective viewpoint without indicating any particular  character, a technique termed poetic-I. Poetic-I is a distinctive voice in  the poem whose identity is not specified and can be understood as a  special case of the character’s gaze or rather as a default. Although it  represents the eyes of a volitional being, the gaze of poetic-I does not  involve strong personality. Bauman (1998, 148) calls it an “identity-less”  gaze. Because it is without identity, it has a certain universality and  flexibility, which makes it easier for the audience members to project  their own feelings. When no other character is referred to, the audience is often  naturally drawn to identify poetic-I with the poet (although this may  not in fact be the case). Unlike other instances of the character’s gaze,  in which the audience understands that the poet and the character  are separate identities, the distinction between poetic-I and the poet  is usually very vague, especially in poems that deal with Deaf people.  Most of Donna Williams’s poems, for example, can be understood as  being told through the gaze of poetic-I (figures 4, 5, 13). Spotlight Gaze Spotlight gaze is cast upon the signer’s hands and highlights their con- figuration or movement. Particular signs or movements are thus fore- grounded as if they are illuminated by a spotlight (see the example of  the falling leaf mentioned earlier). In spotlight gaze, the poet functions  as a poetic instrument and “submerges” into the narrative (with little  facial expression). The poet’s gaze becomes internal to the storytelling,  and the poet does not exhibit any distinct personality. Such eye gaze  is “not that of a narrator or character but rather that of the narrative  itself ” (Bahan and Supalla 1995, 179). The audience is drawn into the  story not by means of someone’s perspective but by directly watching  the sign mediated by the poet’s own gaze. We cannot tell whether the  gaze is omniscient because the eyes do not reveal all-seeing power,  but they also do not feign ignorance. We have already seen some examples of spotlight gaze in figures 2  and 16. To list other examples, Paul Scott’s gaze follows the movement  of his right hand in “Tree” as he represents the circular movement of  the sun (figure 19a). A very similar sign with the same gaze behavior  </page> <page sequence="20"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 391  a. b. Figure 19. The circular movement of the sun highlighted by the gaze in Paul Scott’s  “Tree” (a) and Richard Carter’s “Surprise Apple” (b). appears in Richard Carter’s “Surprise Apple” (figure 19b). Both the  track of the sun and the passing of time are emphasized. The opening sequence of Richard Carter’s “Surprise Apple” is a  good example of spotlight gaze. The gaze traces the hand configura- tion from left to right and back again as the tree blossoms and the  ground slides away (figure 20). The gaze deliberately highlights the  manual signs and is fully under the poet’s control. Richard Carter  explained that he wanted to use his gaze as a camera shooting a  close-up of his articulators (Richard Carter, pers. comm.). What is  also interesting in this example is that, when the two hands represent  separate objects, the gaze follows only the left hand. The poet com- pletely ignores the right hand, which represents an apple falling from  a tree (see the last two pictures in figure 18). In fact, in the next scene  the poet-protagonist seems surprised to find the apple on the ground.  Bauman (1998) observes a similar example of feigned ignorance in  ASL poetry and concludes that such gaze is “wholly separated from  the convincing movements [of a manual sign],” whereas the gaze cast  upon the hand creates “a link between the artist and his image.” Reactive Gaze Similar to a spotlight gaze, a reactive gaze is a glance that is directed  toward a manual sign. However, instead of reinforcing the sign, it reacts  </page> <page sequence="21"> 392 | Sign Language Studie s Figure 20. Spotlight gaze in Richard Carter’s “Surprise Apple.” to and reflects on it. The poet is understood to be an observer, in the  place of the audience, and to be pretending not to know anything  about the poem (making the gaze “external” to the poem). The poet  looks at the hands as if they are remote and unfamiliar objects with  their own will. This creates a separation between the hands (which  develop the story) and the gaze (which fulfills analytical or critical  functions of the narrative). The gaze displays the personality of the  poet as an observer by revealing various emotions (e.g., surprise, dis- trust, confusion, satisfaction). By feigning ignorance of what the hands  are doing, the poet is not omniscient. We have already discussed the reactive use of eye gaze in the ex- ample from Donna Williams’s poem “Who Am I?” (figure 4). Another  </page> <page sequence="22"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 393 Figure 21. Reactive gaze in Johanna Mesch’s “Three Haiku.” example appears in Dorothy Miles’s “Trio” (Sutton-Spence 2005), in  which, on two occasions, the poet creates a new sign and looks down  at her hands as if she is not certain as to what they are signing. “It is  almost as though she is asking, ‘What is this sign?’ Clearly, such a ques- tion would rarely be asked in normal everyday signing because signers  would expect to know what signs they were making” (ibid., 193). Johanna Mesch’s poem from her Three Haiku makes use of a hu- morous aspect of reactive gaze. The poet is happily sunbathing, but  when the sun starts going down, the displeased poet reaches out with  her left hand (representing the sun) and unfolds her fingers to get the  sunlight back (figure 21). This amusing interaction between the poet  and her articulator is done at a metalinguistic level, which is triggered  by a shift in her gaze. She does not look at her hand while she takes  the sun for granted, but once its warmth starts fading, she glances at  her hand, which allows her to react to it (much as Dorothy Miles  turns the darkness into a bat by looking at it). In Richard’s Carter’s “Looking for Diamonds,” the sequence in  which the protagonist runs after a diamond is repeated. The first time,  it happens in a dream. The second time, the protagonist is awake (or  believes he is), and yet the events in his dream recur. There is a dif- ference in gaze behavior on these two occasions. The second time  the protagonist starts running after the diamond, he looks at his own  arms and hands, wondering about his action as he experiences déjà  vu (figure 22). In each case, the reactive gaze at the hands shows the poets’ meta- linguistic awareness of what they are signing. </page> <page sequence="23"> 394 | Sign Language Studie s Figure 22. Different gaze behaviors in Richard Carter’s “Looking for Diamonds.” Panoptic Gaze A successful poem offers a clear mental representation of a poetic  scene, only part of which can be manually encoded. But all-seeing  poets have the whole picture in their mind; thus they can look at vari- ous points in the signing space to acknowledge unseen elements. In  this “panoptic gaze,” the poet functions as a poetic tool by providing  a holistic illustration of the scene by working separately from but in  conjunction with manual signs. The poet becomes part of the narra- tive itself and thus does not show personality or emotion through eye  gaze. Because the gaze is incorporated in the construction of a poetic  scene, it is intradiegetic. For example, Johanna Mesch’s “Twin Leaves” illustrates a tree full  of leaves. Each hand represents a single leaf, and thus only two leaves  can be represented simultaneously (figure 23). However, the gaze is  Figure 23. Panoptic gaze in Johanna Mesch’s “Twin Leaves.” </page> <page sequence="24"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 395 Figure 24. The “whole picture” of the tree in “Twin Leaves” achieved through the  combination of hands and gaze. cast at various points in the signing space, suggesting the presence of  “other leaves.” The hands and the gaze complement each other to  provide the whole picture (figure 24). Another example appears in Donna Williams’s “My Home Is My  Castle.” The poet makes an analogy between the objects on her shelf  (books, DVDs, CDs) and bricks that constitute a castle. When she rep- resents a pile of bricks surrounding her, her gaze is cast upon various  spots in the air, while her hands represent a couple of bricks, drawing  attention to different parts of the overall picture (figure 25). Prescient Gaze A prescient gaze foretells the location of an upcoming sign by looking  at its location. Like spotlight gaze or panoptic gaze, the poet becomes  a poetic tool and “submerges” into the narrative. Thus the poet ceases  to exist as a volitional being, and the gaze does not reveal personality.  The role of prescient gaze is to foretell the location of the next sign  Figure 25. Panoptic gaze in Donna Williams’s “My Home Is My Castle.” </page> <page sequence="25"> 396 | Sign Language Studie s and allow the audience to prepare for the next scene. In prescient  gaze, the gaze precedes the manual sign, and the hands follow it (in  contrast to spotlight gaze). Both panoptic and prescient gaze reveal the poet’s omniscient  power, but while panoptic gaze is synchronic (i.e., seeing everything  in a given moment), prescient (i.e., knowing what will happen next)  gaze involves a sequence of events. The poet knows precisely what  is happening next, so the poet’s gaze can go one step ahead of the  manual signing. Panoptic gaze and prescient gaze are unique to poetic signing. It is  rare to find them in spontaneous signing because, in order to provide  a panoptic view or predict an upcoming location, a poem needs to  be prestructured. They are also less popular in poems that involve a  great deal of action, in which the poet is likely to take on someone’s  perspective. In contrast, panoptic and prescient gaze appear in more  descriptive and conceptual poems, which may involve motion but  less human agency.  Johanna Mesch’s “Winter” (from her SSL haiku quartet) illustrates  a brief sequence of snowfalls and how they bounce off the ground.  Mesch looks straight into the camera when she signs the title, win- ter (gaze toward the audience; figure 26a). Then she looks to her  left (26b), foretelling the location of the next sign. snowfalls (26c).  After this sequence, she shifts her gaze to her right (26d) before her  hands move for the next sign (26e). This repeated pattern of a pre- scient gaze followed by a manual sign produces a contrast, which is  characteristic of a haiku. Prescient gaze is often used to indicate the second of two objects  or concepts in juxtaposition (contrast) while the hands are still  referring to the first. For example, Donna Williams’s haiku “Identity”4  contrasts Deaf and hearing individuals. At the end of deaf, her gaze  shifts to her right to foretell the direction of the next sign, hearing  (figure 27). Similar use of prescient gaze can be found in Penny   Beschizza’s BSL haiku “Politics,” when she juxtaposes politicians in  the United States (left) and Britain (right) (figure 28). She shifts her  gaze to the right while her left index finger is still pointing toward  the left. </page> <page sequence="26">  a. b. c.  d. e. Figure 26.

Table 1 summarizes our classification of various types of eye gaze  in sign language poetry. Gaze frequently changes its direction and  function, and it is unlikely that a poet will stick to one gaze pattern  throughout an entire poem. Poets often alternate their gaze patterns  (e.g., a poet in the role of a character may glance at the audience  from time to time). Bahan and Supalla (1995, 189) have character- ized such instantaneous gaze as “eye gaze behavior without dura- tion”  ([-duration]), as opposed to eye gaze that occurs as part of the  sequence of manual signing ([+duration]).  Moreover, gaze behavior is often ambiguous and does not clearly  follow a single pattern (e.g., a gaze toward the hands can be interpret- ed as a character looking at the hand or as a poetic tool to highlight  manual signs). Our aim here is not to provide a clear-cut, comprehen- sive classification but to find a way to approach the complex maze of  gaze patterns in sign language poetry.  Conclusion This article has described several distinctive gaze patterns and func- tions in sign language poetry. Although it is impossible to account for  </page> <page sequence="28"> Eye Gaze in Creative Sign Language | 399 all gaze behaviors, such accounts help us to understand the complexity  of the role of eye gaze in sign language poetry. The use of eye gaze is often a subtle and intuitive craft and thus  harder to control than other common techniques in sign language  poetry, such as the manipulation of handshape, rhythm, and the use of  space. However, this subtlety can convey delicate nuances of a poem  that might otherwise be overlooked. In particular, gaze can reveal a  poet’s stance toward the individual’s own work and contribute to the  overall impression the poem makes (e.g., emotional or detached, sub- jective or objective, fictional or realistic). The use of eye gaze can be  an art in itself, which is accessible only in poetry of a visual modality.

We use the word “poem” or “poetry” to refer to both poems and  stories because, in sign language, it is difficult (and ultimately unhelpful) to  draw a line between poetry and prose.   2.
