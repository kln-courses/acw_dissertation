<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art and the Natural Environment NOT SEEING WOLVES SHERYL ST. GERMAIN Iowa State University July 23, On Board the Columbia, Traveling From Sitka to Petersburg It's drizzling and gray, slightly foggy. Can't see much of the landscape beyond about half a mile. It's a shame; this is supposed to be a particularly beautiful stretch. We just saw some humpback whales close to the ship, and I sat on the deck in the wet air watching them and thinking about how Alaska is home to many of the threatened Ones. Thinking about whales leads me, inevitably, to think about wolves. The wolf, long a denizen of the wilderness, is the animal that symbolizes for most of us both the powerful beauty and feral terror of wilderness. Whether it is the depraved and godless wilderness of the Old Testament or the mortally terrifying American wil derness of the early settlers or the disappearing, nourishing wilderness we now crave to sanctify and preserve, the wolf is metaphor and mother, heart and body of that wild geography. Its fragile existence is a dark echo of what we have come to understand, actually or mythically, as wilderness. When the last wolf has drawn its last breath in this, its last land, the concept of wilderness as we have known and imagined it will be equally and forever without breath. Although the largest gray wolf populations in the world live in Alaska and Canada—perhaps as many as 10,000 in Alaska alone—as late as 1994, Alaska's government sponsored the killing of wolves by poison and traps, from planes and snowmobiles. "Land and shoot" hunting of wolves, whereby the wolves are located by plane and then shot 100 yards from where the plane lands, is currently still allowed in Alaska. Wolves are extinct in most of Europe and nearly extinct in the mainland United States, where small populations of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) live in northeastern Minnesota and Isle Royale, Michigan, as well as Yellowstone Park. A small popula tion of red wolves (Canis rufus) is said to live in the swampy thickets of southwest ern Louisiana and extreme eastern Texas, but this population is thought to be near extinction as well. A photograph of a wild red wolf has not been taken for more than 50 years. Red wolves, considerably smaller than gray wolves, are far along the road to extinction, not only because of hunting but also because of hybridization. They regularly interbreed with coyotes and dogs. I never saw any wild red wolves when I lived in southwestern Louisiana, although I knew they were reputed to live there and I liked thinking that something powerfully silent and wild shared the land with me, drinking from the same waters. I haven't seen any wolves thus far on this trip and don't expect to. I know they're here, and that's enough. Gray wolves live and hunt on most of the major islands of southeast Alaska, but they travel only during the crepuscular hours and avoid humans much more successfully than do bears. It's appropriate that I would begin Organization &amp; Environment, Vol. 12 No. 1, March 1999 75-82 © 1999 Sage Publications, Inc. 75</page><page sequence="2">76 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 1999 to think about the unseeable and disappearing wolf of my birthplace as well as the stronger but just as invisible wolf of Alaska as we sail down the waters that surround the very islands that may be the last strongholds of wolves. That the air is misty, that I can see nothing but white fog as the ferry moves slowly through the waters, is fit ting. I know that hundreds of rich islands, mountainous and verdant, lie beyond the fog. The landscape, like the wolf, is hidden. Wolves populated the fairy tales my mother used to read me, as well as the oral tradition of Cajun folktales, so although as a child I never saw a wolf, I had some mythical sense of it. Barry Lopez, whose incomparable book On Wolves and Men I've been reading in my tent late at night, suggests that the wolf is not a creature we have known so much as it is a creature we have consistently imagined. And it is cer tainly true that the wolf I came to think I knew was a creature of the imagination. Even as a child I knew that the wolf of the fairy and animal tales was one imag ined by adults; I knew that the tales almost always had a moral and that the wolf in the tales was something other than the mysterious animal that lived in our swamps and ate nutria. I knew the story of the werewolf, of course, which I read in some of my mother's old books and later watched the film versions of on television. My mother also used to tell me stories about a Cajun version of the werewolf, the loup garou, in which the loup garou, always a man under some sort of curse, could be disenchanted by bleeding. What I remember most about these stories is the way my mother's voice would get louder and more musical whenever she pronounced loup garou, the rhyme of the words seducing her to dramatize them so that they came out sounding very much like a wolf howl. If I had rarely seen a wolf as a child, I had heard its song many times. Not in the wild but in captivity, in zoos and through those electronic prisons of radio, televi sion, and film. A wolf howl consists of a lingering melodic cry that rises slowly in pitch and volume and then quickly drops after the highest and most intense notes are reached. Humans have tended to hear it as a deep, sorrowful cry, piercing in its distinctiveness. Wolf song is as necessary for wolves as whale song is for whales. It announces the presence of a wolf pack and warns intruders not to trespass. Howling increases in the winter months when the wolves mate, so it may be a part of the mat ing ritual, as is bird song. But wolves also howl when they are restless or anxious, so their singing is related to their emotional state as well. When a group of wolves howls together, the wolves don't howl in one pitch; instead, they harmonize. There's an obvious reason for this, in that a few wolves harmonizing can give the impression of a much larger group and thus frighten off intruders. But maybe the harmonizing also fills some need for bonding, connection. Wolves live and hunt in packs; they are social animals and have to hunt together if they are to be successful. An Alaskan moose, which is one of the animals wolves hunt here, can weigh 10 to 15 times as much as one wolf. But speculating on the purposes that wolf song might serve for wolves doesn't explain why the wolf howl strikes the rich chords it does for humans. The cry seems to many of us so emotive, so deeply vibrant and plaintive, that it would take a heart shriveled by years of cynicism not to hear it as a song of remorse, deep pain, and regret. Sometimes I think the whole history of blues music is the history of humans trying to imitate the poetry of the wolf howl, that singing celebration of sadness, of things gone wrong, of the essential condition of loneliness. It is what I want to do some nights when I sense that I was torn from some other human in some primeval Eden, that all I can feel now is that tear and the Beloved who might heal the wound is lost, absent, gone, disappeared, dead, extinct. What else to do at that moment but howl your guts out, moan your wounds to the moon, sing your heart to the darken</page><page sequence="3">St. Germain / NOT SEEING WOLVES 77 ing empty, empty sky. Wolf howl is song and elegy for lost love and for all that is wild and dying. At least that's how I hear it. Is this anthropomorphism? Yes and no. The wolf is literally wild and dying out in parts of the world. It makes sense that its song would evoke an aesthetic response that grows out of our realization of the wolf's great losses and that we would be moved to contemplate our own losses, whatever they might be. Indians, who listen deeply to the songs of animals, believe wolf howls are the cries of spirits trying to make it back to earth. Aldo Leopold would describe them as outbursts of "wild defiant sorrow." One thing's certain: No one who has ever heard a wolf howl can ever forget it. I have heard on many occasions the howling of wild coyotes, but their songs are quicker, higher, faster, and more staccato than the long, low, melodious moan of wolf, even if I am hearing it only through electronic transmission. It's now dusk and the air has turned chilly. I pull out my sleeping bag. The already shadowy evening has taken on a depth of shadow twice what it had before. No wolf could ever be seen in this weather, this giant gray cloud through which we appear to be travelling. Most all of the other passengers who were sitting out on the deck have moved into the heated solarium area. I decide to stay outside a while longer, wrapped in my sleeping bag. Although I've given up on seeing wolves, I like sitting outside while the ferry winds its way through these many islands; it feels like some small but important intimacy to share this air with those I cannot see. The islands of southeast Alaska support different kinds of mammal populations, with all kinds of interesting consequences. Admiralty Island, for example, doesn't have any wolves. As a result, Sitka deer often reach high densities there. Some of the plants deer feed on, such as highbush cranberry, willow, black Cottonwood, and beach strawberry, cannot survive the repeated cutbacks of their entire annual growth for which deer are responsible; therefore, these plants are rare on Admiralty. Admiralty's meadows, which are filled with deer all summer, don't have the herb diversity of the mainland or other highlands that are wolf patrolled and have fewer deer. Almost 50 years ago, Leopold would write that "just as a deer herd lives in mor tal fear of its wolves, so does a mountain live in mortal fear of its deer," noting that whereas a deer taken by wolves may be replaced in 2 or 3 years, a range destroyed by too many deer may not be able to replace itself in as many decades. It's clear to me that at least some of the mountainous islands of southeast Alaska must also live in fear of their deer and must welcome their wolves and human predators. It has taken a while to reeducate the American public about the wolf. Because of the fear wolves strike in many of our hearts, much recent wolf literature has dedi cated itself to showing that the wolf can be "good" and "useful," even when it is kill ing deer, which is an animal that the American public has tended to romanticize most intensely ever since the sentimental deer images of Bambi flooded the film screens. To see the wolf with new eyes, it has been necessary to see deer with new eyes as well. And yet, because we've needed to see the wolf as "good," the wolf of our imagi nation has suffered even more than the whale from a kind of flattening of its imagery. As the movement to bring the wolf back from extinction gave rise to more and more organizations with things to sell, the wolf teetered back from extinction but became, at the same time, a figure of decoration for a commercial art that is little more than kitsch. A recent magazine I received from the National Wildlife Federa tion contained advertisements not only for wolf T-shirts and sweatshirts but wolf carpets, wolf glasses, wolf bookmarks, wolf shawls, wolf doormats, wolf desk</page><page sequence="4">78 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 1999 clocks, wolf wallets, and wolf magnets, all of which have the same tame wolf face staring out at you. You know what it is supposed to represent: It is a good wolf, a kind wolf, a victimized wolf. It is not only the well-intentioned—and important—conservation organizations that participate in this flattening and marketing of wolf imagery. Many entries for wolf in recently published encyclopedias begin by stating how maligned the wolf is—that it is the most maligned of creatures; wolves are intelligent, affectionate ani mals, reliable family members, and exemplary parents, the entries will affirm. All of this is by and large true. Wolves are, by all accounts, good parents. They are monogamous, which fact belies the negative sexual connotations wo If has come to have in English. If we call a man a wolf we mean he has predatory interest in girls or women. A human wolf can also refer to a male homosexual seducer or to a female who is pursuing men, a female who is a prostitute, or a female who is simply not a virgin. From early times, lupa has signified "prostitute" as well as "she-wolf." In France, if you say of a girl or a woman that elle a vu le loup (she has seen the wolf), it means she's not a virgin. Witches, believed in the Middle Ages to be sexually insa tiable women, were said to sometimes take the shape of wolves. Yet not only are actual wolves not sexual predators, some would argue that they even seem to evi dence intimacy when having sex. Unlike most animals, the physical ties associated with wolf copulation may last as long as 30 minutes. Wolf has also become attached to a number of names of plants and even other creatures that are assumed—rightly or wrongly— to be predatory and rapacious. A wolf tree is one that crowds out younger trees. Wolf's bane is another name for the beautiful, poisonous monkshood (aconite) that grows here and in most of the east ern half of the United States. Meat soaked in the juices of this plant was used to poi son wolves, and the European species of this plant is the celebrated wolf's bane of werewolf lore. Wolf peach or wolf apple was a common name for the tomato in the early 19th century because the fruit was thought to be poisonous. The wildflower we call lupine takes its name from lupus and the twice mistaken notion that both the flowers and wolves are destructively predatory. The wolf eel is a kind of wolffish found in the waters we are currently traversing. Wolffishes are eel-like fishes with strong jaws and large canine teeth that have been known to attack people and whose bites may cause serious wounds. In music, wolf means a harshness in the tones of a stringed instrument, caused by defective vibration or dissonance in some of the intervals of a keyboard instrument. It is ironic that an animal whose own song is so hauntingly beautiful would have its name attached to harshness or dissonance in music. But there's an old Greek super stition that takes the irony even further, in which wolf comes to mean more than just an unwanted distortion in music or sound, it means a complete loss of sound, spe cifically one's voice. The superstition had it that you would lose your voice if a wolf saw you. So that if someone asked, "Has the wolf seen you?" it meant "Have you lost your tongue?" It was thought that something in the eyes of the wolf inhibited the human spirit—later writers would claim it was the fear the wolf struck in human hearts—thus were those the wolf gazed on unable to take in the breath essential to voice. The wolf, like the gorgon Medusa, represented something too awful to behold: one's own primitive, animal self. And yet, although it is true that we have tended to imagine wolves consistently and unfairly as fierce, destructive, rapacious creatures, it is not true that the wolf is a wholly benign creature. Some encyclopedias state, wrongly, that a wolf has never attacked a human. Healthy wolves have, in fact, killed Indians, and rabid wolves have attacked people of all races. The early American settlers had good reason to be</page><page sequence="5">St. Germain / NOT SEEING WOLVES 79 afraid of wolves, which were known to dig underneath graves to eat the remains of the newly dead. The diaries of women who made the first westward journeys are filled with concern for burying their loved ones who died on the trail deep enough so that the wolves would not be able to dig them up. One of the most poignant of these stories was that of Ellen Smith, who had already buried her husband on the trail and was left with nine children, among them a dying 16-year-old daughter. The daugh ter begged, on her deathbed, that she have a grave 6-ft deep, with rocks piled on top of it, so the wolves would not dig her up. When the men of the company dug a grave only 4-ft deep, the mother went out herself to dig deeper until the men couldn't bear seeing her out there alone. They returned to help. Wolves have always hunted livestock, but in early days, the killing of a family cow or mules or even chickens and hogs could mean starvation for a family. It's also not true, as many have argued, that wolves only kill animals that are old or sick or injured. They sometimes take healthy animals. Sometimes the predator instinct in wolves can't be turned off. Sometimes they kill everything they see. Wolves attack in packs and are ferocious in their eating habits. To "wolf down food" means to eat ravenously and is one wolf expression, unlike most, that has its origins in actual observation of wolves. Wolves will sometimes dismember a prey before eating it; often, they don't kill the prey before eating it so that the hapless prey has to die what must be an excruciating death, watching as it is literally eaten to death. I shiver and pull the sleeping bag up to just under my chin. I don't know if it's the chill in the air or the chill in my thoughts that's caused me to feel like a finger of cold has just traced my entrails. It's peaceful on the boat, and the dark sea that surrounds the ferry is soothing, as is the sense that we are surrounded with and protected by mountains, although I only rarely catch a glimpse of them. The attitude of Indians toward the wolf is radically different than that of Europe ans, out of whose culture came the myth of the werewolf, a cursed, depraved crea ture on whom the most base traits of the human race—lust, greed, violence—are projected. The wolf is, for many Indian groups, greatly admired for its stamina and hunting skills. The Tlingit respect the wolf so much that it represents both a tribe and a clan for some. Every Tlingit is born into one of two great tribal divisions, known as Eagles and Ravens, but the northern Tlingit use Wolf interchangeably with Eagle. Eagle is subdivided into other kinship clans, and Wolf is a common clan of the Eagle moiety. I have seen the face of the wolf carved on many a Tlingit totem pole and have seen several Tlingit wolf transformation masks where buried inside of a mask of a man is a deeper mask of a wolf. The Kwakiutl, as well as the Nootka, have ceremonies of initiation in which Wolf Spirits seizes participants. When Indi ans of these clans put on the skins of wolf, or wear the mask of wolf or ask for the spirit of the wolf, it is an invigorating, galvanizing act. Interestingly, in at least one Indian culture, women are separated from wolves. Women are forbidden to hunt, trap, or skin wolves in the Koyukon tradition because of an ancient story that is still told, in which a girl met up with a wolf who took her for his wife even though he already had two wolf-wives. When the woman gave birth to a boy child, the wolf killed his two other wives. Afterward, the spirits of the two wolf-wives came back, killed the human wife, and devoured her body. The story is told to explain why women may only come in contact with wolves after they are too old to have children. This is an interesting story because like some early European superstitions, female sexuality is linked with the wolf. In the case of the European tradition, they—the wolf and female sexuality—are sometimes one and the same. Although</page><page sequence="6">80 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 1999 it's difficult for a nonnative to fully understand the cultural significance of the Koyukon story, it seems clear that there is something disastrous, for them, about having a sexually receptive woman come so close to a wolf. Female sexuality is thus paradoxically linked to the wolf. Oddly enough, the implications of the Koyukon story are similar to those of the most well-known European fairy tale that features wolves: Grimm's version of Little Red-Riding Hood. The moral in both stories seems to be that the female sex best stay away from the wolf. Even in earlier and radically different versions of Little Red-Riding Hood, we can see the combination of wolf and woman breeding trouble. In one of the earliest versions of the story, the grandmother is not eaten by the wolf, she is the wolf—a werewolf to be exact—who has the power to change shapes. Riding-Hood is a much smarter little girl in this version and manages to kill the grandmother/werewolf without any help from a woodsman, but the message is in some ways startlingly the same: Stay away from wolves or you will turn into something horribly unnatural—a grandmother who tries to destroy her own granddaughter. And who knows what might happen if women joined with the wolves? Clarissa Pinkola Estés, in Women Who Run With the Wolves, the acclaimed psychological exploration into the archetype of the wild woman, sees the wolf as representative of that which is female, instinctual, and nourishing of the creative spirit. She is right to connect La Loba—Wolf Woman—with instinct and imagination. It is wolf I most think of when I think what an instinctual female wildness might be like, an animal that contains the contrasting qualities of power and nurturance that one also finds in goddess figures such as Demeter or Kali, for example. For the most part, though, the mythical wolf of the non-Indian world is a degen erate. There are nurturing images of the wolf—most notably in the story of Romu lus and Remus who were said to have been suckled by a she-wolf—but these are rare. Lopez argues that we really need a "new wolf' that synthesizes the images from the Indian and European traditions. He believes we, as a people, are sorry about having pigeon-holed the wolf into the bad-guy slot and that we really want to know, now, how complex a figure the wolf really is, how ultimately unfathomable. He believes we want to return mystery to the wolf. I think some of us do want that. But mostly what I see now—Lopez's astonishing work notwithstanding—is not a new wolf but a New Age wolf. It is not the wolf that Lopez wants, but it is the wolf the public seems to want. A wolf stripped of all that makes it something to be afraid of. A wolf that is victim, a creature to be pitied, a creature exactly the opposite of the creature the early settlers imagined it to be. A creature so well marketed and well defined there is no mystery, no place for imagination. It is what we do with things of power in America. We have exchanged one stereotype for another. What is needed is an image of the wolf that acknowledges both its terror and its beauty, its great skills as parent and partner as well as predator and hunter. An imagery that does not deny the dark myths of the wolf, "wrong" though some of them may be, but enters into those myths to try to engage them on their own terms. We must understand that the wolf and the myth of the wolf are two separate things, and we need both of them, although we must not confuse one with the other. Just as important, I think it necessary that those of us interested in wolves explore our own relationship with the wolf, and the myth of the wolf, and not try to prey on other culture's myths. Wolves can never be brothers of the White man in the way they are to the Indian, but they can be what Henry Beston calls "other nations," caught with us, for a time on the earth, nations we can nourish and be nourished by. There can be no universal "synthesis" of the image of the wolf that can be mean ingful for us all, no "correct" image of the wolf that can stand for its complexity and</page><page sequence="7">St. Germain / NOT SEEING WOLVES 81 mystery or make up for our own cruelty and stupidity with respect to our own ravag ing of wolf populations. Let us protect the real wolf; let us nurture it as best we can. But let us also come to know and nurture what of wolf lives in our own hearts. Let us interrogate and caress the myths that infect our blood, the set of metaphors we have come to understand as wolf. The ferry has slowed down as we navigate what appears to be a particularly tor tuous pathway through a new group of islands. It's late and dark, as dark as it ever gets here. Even though there's probably almost a full moon tonight, the light is so shrouded in mist and cloud it might as well be a new moon. It's gotten even colder and my sleeping bag isn't doing a great job keeping me warm. But I don't want to go in just yet. I wonder what people were thinking as they sailed up this passage nearly 150 years ago for either untamed beauty or for dreams and gold. What did they think as they sailed north past these same mountains and over this same ocean? Did the gold seekers notice the beauty? Did they look for whales in the water, wolves on the islands? Were they amazed when they saw them? Or were they afraid? So what is the wolf for me? The wolf is my father, my father's lust for life, large and fanged, his gift to me, so that when I want, I want hard, I want deep, I am raven ous, crazed with the thought of blood and food and touch. The wolf is the silent wildness I never saw—the red wolf living beside me in the swampy thickets of Lou isiana, the gray wolves all around me as we slip through these gray Alaskan mists—and may never see. It is all that is wild and intangible and silent and invisi ble, all the things I believe in fiercely, although I can't touch them. It is a creature, then, that I must have faith in, having never seen it. I must believe in it as some believe in God. I must have faith that the wolf lives and that the large tracts of wil derness it needs to survive live with it. The wolf is me. It is the howl of my body when I'm bleeding, my own fur redden ing like that of the red wolf. The red wolf is an animal surviving by compromise, transforming itself by hybridization. Its lesson to me is about compromise, not purity. The wolf is the dissonant notes I came to love when learning piano, the wrong notes that sounded right, sounded sad and beautiful at once. The wolf is the mad ness of New Orleans at carnival time, the city itself a she-wolf that nursed me. The wolf is what made me want to be a poet; it is the howl of the poet, the fiercely indi vidual cry of the American poet, the barbaric yawp of Whitman, the strange lovely music of Dickinson, the animal cry of the human. It is the sound of poetry, that song of blood and beauty, that song of pure ecstatic oneness, body and heart and mind concentrated on making that one sound, the one song that will say here I am. I am wolf when I fish, wolf when I write, both acts of prédation where the skills of a hunter are needed. Wolves mostly fail in the hunting attempts, and I am like them here too. I am wolf when I mate and when I mother, loving with all fierceness and intensity. Virginia Woolf wrote that women needed to kill the "angel in the house" to allow their imaginations to run wild. She never told us how to kill the angels nor did she say with what we should replace them. I say invite the wolves in to kill the angels and take their place. Let the wolves come in with their bad-ass selves. My dear friend Darrell, a wonderful poet, recently refused the gift of a well meaning friend—a tourist version of an Indian dream catcher that will catch your bad dreams—"I need my bad dreams," he said. "I don't want them taken away." Let the wolves come as nightmares if they will, nightmares to keep us honest and grounded. May there always be animals like them of which we are afraid. May there always be animals that ask more of us than we think we can possibly give. May these sometimes be the same animal.</page><page sequence="8">82 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 1999 Red Wolf Notes oh small silent wildness, all that is female all that is red rise up and sing your blood-song Here, wolf, is my heart I give it no longer to any man</page></plain_text>
