<plain_text><page sequence="1">MONITORING TRUST LEVELS IN ONGOING EXCHANGE RELATIONS BYRON A. MATTHEWS Department of Sociology University of Maryland Baltimore CountY ELIOT SHIMOFF Department o f Psychology University of Maryland Baltimore County Three experiments employed procedures which allowed trust levels to be continuously monitored during ongoing two-party exchange. Level of trust was behaviorally defined by degree of "expansion" of exchange-that is, by how far ahead in earnings one party put the other. Higher levels of trust were increasingly risky because they resulted in propor- tionately greater earnings reductions when the other person was untrustworthy (failed to reciprocate). Consistent with Blau's (1964, 1968) theoretical descriptions of the develop- ment of trust and expanded exchange, trust levels increased gradually in most pairs, even in a procedure (Alternation Cost) which made low trust levels costly. Two manipulations (Time Uncertainty and Exchange Uncertainty) which made it uncertain whether the other person would be able to reciprocate produced dramatic decreases in trust. A third mani- pulation (Temptation), which made it uncertain whether the other person would choose to reciprocate, had similar effects. The combination of a reduced likelihood of reciprocation and Alternation Cost produced intermediate reductions in trust levels in some pairs and a cessation of exchange in others. The importance of trust for the maintenance of organized social life, especially in complex societies characterized by relations of inter- dependence and exchange, is widely recognized (Blau, 1964, 1968; Rotter, 1971). This article describes an explicitly behavioral approach to the experimental analysis of trust in ongoing cooperative exchange relations. Consistent with the seminal work of Deutsch (1958, 1960a, 1 960b, 1 962), trust is not considered a property of behavior alone, but of AUTHORS' NOTE: This research was supported by Grant MH29385 from the National Institute of Mental Health, Byron A.

In our pro- cedure, variations in degree or level of trust are identified with variations in the magnitude of the possible loss. We examine trust in the context of exchange for two reasons. First, exchange has proven to be a theoretical concept of unusual scope and usefulness for the social and behavioral sciences (Thibaut and Kelley, 1959; Homans, 1974; Blau, 1964; Ekeh, 1974; Chadwick-Jones, 1976). The notion of exchange is extremely general with respect to behaving unit (for example, a person, organization, or nation) and content (that is, the things or behaviors exchanged). This generality makes informa- tion about exchange processes of potential interest to diverse social science specialties which may otherwise have few organizing concepts in common. Second, trust has particular relevance for the initiation and maintenance of cooperative exchange. Cooperative exchange may be simultaneous, but usually occurs sequentially. For example, person A might initiate an exchange sequence by mowing person B's lawn this week in the expectation that B will return the favor next week. Person A may initiate the exchange because of an assumption that a norm of reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960) will constrain the behavior of B or because of a favorable ratio of potential long-term benefits to short-term risk. Sequential exchange necessarily involves a risk that benefits will not be reciprocated: When next week arrives, B could go to the beach instead of mowing A's lawn. To the extent that an initial conferring of benefits ("giving") involves direct or opportunity costs to the giver, that person will suffer a net reduction in outcomes if benefits are not reciprocated. Thus, an initial give is trusting behavior by the definition above. Note, further, that every iteration of an exchange sequence requires an initial give by either A or B. Thus, the initiation and main- tenance of sequential cooperative exchange requires trusting behavior by at least one party. Fundamental to our approach to measuring variations in level of trust is the concept of "expansion" of exchange. Blau (1964: 315) noted that while "little trust is required for the minor transactions with which exchange relations typically start, the gradual expansion of exchange permits the partners to prove their trustworthiness to each other." For example, for A to mow B's lawn once on the expectation that B will do the same for A the following week involves less trust than the case in which A mows B's lawn ten consecutive times on a similar expectation of</page><page sequence="3">540 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION eventual reciprocation. The latter sequence involves the greater expan- sion of exchange in that the degree of unfavorable inequity produced by the initial giver is larger, and the reduction in outcomes risked is correspondingly greater. Simply stated, degree of expansion of ex- change and level of trust both refer to how far ahead one party puts the other. Since degree of expansion and level of trust are behaviorally identical, the two terms will be used interchangeably to refer to the magnitude of inequity (and, by implication, the magnitude of possible loss) produced by a giver during sequential cooperative exchange. In our procedure, pairs of subjects freely chose on each trial between earning points worth 0.5 cents each independently or through exchange. In the independent option, which was in effect for both persons if selected by either, both persons could press a button once per trial to earn three points. In the exchange option (in effect only if selected by both persons) only one person could respond per trial to produce nine points for the other (a "give"). Thus, exchange could only occur sequen- tially over trials. Finally, and most important, the participants controlled the direction of giving on every exchange trial, making possible wide variation in numbers of consecutive gives (that is, in levels of trust). In this procedure, if person A gives to person B on trial 1, and if B reciprocates on trial 2, each will earn nine points for the two trials, compared with the six points each could have earned working inde- pendently. Exchange is potentially the higher-paying option. However, since exchange must be sequential, it involves a risk to the initial giver in an exchange sequence that the other person will switch to independent work instead of reciprocating. And, as exchange expands (as the other person is put further ahead through consecutive gives), the size of the reduction in earnings risked by the giver increases proportionally. For example, for A to give once, putting B "temporarily" nine points ahead, A must forego earning the three points available on that trial for an independent response. Should B then switch to independent work instead of giving in return, A will simply be out those three points. But ten consecutive gives which put the other person ahead by 90 points risk a 30-point earnings reduction if not reciprocated. Again, higher levels of trust imply proportionally greater possible losses, depending on the subsequent behavior of the other person. The task of an experi- mental analysis is to specify functional relations between situational factors and manipulations (independent variables) and level of trust (dependent variable).</page><page sequence="4">Matthews, Shimoff / EXPANSION OF EXCHANGE 541 The procedure was designed for use in conjunction with intrasubject experimental designs (Bushell and Burgess, 1969). Longitudinal experi- mentation has long been the method of choice in behavioral psychology (Sidman, 1960), but its potential utility for the study of social inter- action processes is gradually being recognized particularly, but not exclusively, among sociologists (Hamblin et al., 1971; Marwell and Schmitt, 1975; Burgess and Nielson, 1974; Hake et al., 1975; Shimoff and Matthews, 1975; Matthews, 1977). To briefly characterize the approach, large numbers of responses of relatively few subjects are observed over extended periods of time and across a sequence of dif- ferent experimental conditions. Interest centers on the search for orderly relations between situation and behavior at the unit, rather than aggregate, level. Generalization is sought in terms of similarities in the form of functional relations, while parameter values may vary some- what according to participants' preexperimental histories. Aggregation of data is considered appropriate only when the nature of the unit-level relations is not thereby obscured or misrepresented. Aside from speci- fically methodological rationales for such an approach, it may also have greater utility for the extrapolation and application of research results since the focus then is often on the specific, rather than average, case. A behavioral approach to the conceptualization and investigation of trust is, of course, not the only one possible. The major alternative is a mediational formulation in which trust appears as an attitudinal or other dispositional variable which produces or is expressed in behavior. In that case trust serves as an inferred or hypothetical independent vari- able which bridges or mediates between (1) the situation in conjunction with the individual's relevant history of experience and (2) the indi- vidual's behavior. The behavioral approach is taken here for three reasons. First, in remaining at the level of behavior and its objective determinants and eschewing hypothetical "explanatory" entities and processes, a par- simonious account in a consistent dimensional system may be possible. This is perhaps little more than an esthetic preference where the parties to exchange are persons. However, the attribution of attitudes to, for example, organizations or nations may be excessively anthropomorphic or metaphorical. Second, a behavioral approach focuses attention on publicly observable and (in principle) directly manipulable deter- minants. To the extent that these can be identified, the information may be of greater usefulness for those concerned with practical application (Kunkel, 1975). Finally, the approach articulates with and can draw on</page><page sequence="5">542 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION a well-developed body of basic behavioral theory and methodological technique of demonstrated utility over a wide range of behaviors, settings, and subjects (Honig and Staddon, 1977). In any case, the dominant choice of approach to the study of trust eventually will depend on which deals most effectively with the subject matter. In the mean- time, paradigm clashes are premature and probably unnecessary, since the mediationist is free to insert intervening variables (for example, attitudes, interpretations, perceptions, subjective probabilities) into the behaviorist's account, while the behaviorist is free to omit or reform- ulate them in the mediationist's account. Most experimental studies of trust have employed Prisoner's Dilemma or other mixed-motive, matrix-game formats (Deutsch, 1958, 1960a, 1960b; Loomis, 1959; Solomon, 1960; Schlenker et al., 1973). We have departed from this tradition for three reasons. First, many persons do not respond to a matrix game as a potential exchange situation (Nemeth, 1970). Second, it has proven difficult to devise a matrix game procedure that both allows level of trust to vary over a wide range of values and remains comprehensible to participants (Swinth, 1967). Third, we sought a procedure which would allow varia- tions in trust to be continuously monitored "on line"-that is, over time and treatments as exchange proceeds. In the research reported here, trust levels were observed during cooperative two-party exchange occurring in a very simplified situation. Once behavior appeared to have stabilized, the situation was gradually complicated by the introduction of experimental manipulations, singly and later in combination, as levels of trust were continuously moni- tored. We have begun with manipulations which, depending on their effects, might persuade researchers of various theoretical and method- ological orientations that trust can be usefully defined and investigated in a behavioral framework. Thus, we have been concerned initially with assessing the "construct validity" of trust as defined here by seeing whether trust varies as it should as conditions change. In particular, if variation in expansion of exchange is to be identified with variation in trust, it must be sensitive to changes in probability of reciprocation. METHOD SUBJECTS Subjects were 34 undergraduate volunteers (26 female and 8 male) recruited from introductory sociology classes "to earn money on a</page><page sequence="6">Matthews, Shimoff / EXPANSION OF EXCHA NGE 543 simple button-pressing task." The subjects were assembled into 17 same- sex dyads by time of availability. Each pair was scheduled for two 20- minute sessions Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; each day's earnings were paid at the start of the following scheduled day. Subjects sat in individual, sound-attenuating cubicles and could communicate only through their responses on the apparatus. Pair members were promised anonymity and were separately escorted to and from the laboratory each day to ensure that neither ever learned the other's identity. APPARATUS AND INSTRUCTIONS Pair members operated identical control consoles (Figure 1) con- nected with automatic programming and recording equipment in an adjacent room. The console contained add-subtract counters displaying own and other's current-session point totals. Points were worth 0.5? each, allowing maximum earnings of about $2.50 per subject per 20- minute session during stable exchange. The point counters were zeroed at the start of each session. A third counter showed the number of minutes remaining in each 20-minute session; when that counter reached zero, the session shut off automatically. At the lower left was a toggle switch for choosing between inde- pendent-work (SELF) and exchange (EXCHG); this task switch was always operable. The pair of lights below the task switch indicated the position of the other person's switch, those above followed the position of the subject's own switch. At the lower right were three lights labeled SELF, GIVE, and GET. The SELF light indicated the availability of independent work and was lit for both subjects on every trial on which either or both persons had his task switch in the SELF position. Thus, if either person preferred to work alone, both had to do so. A press on the POINTS button when the SELF light was lit added three points to the presser's total and initiated a ten-second intertrial interval during which the POINTS button was inoperative and all console lights were extinguished. During independent work, both subjects could earn three points on every trial. Exchange was available only when both persons' task switches were in the EXCHG position. At the start of each trial during exchange, one person's GIVE light and the other's GET light were lit. A press on the POINTS button when the presser's GIVE light was lit added nine points to the other person's total and initiated the intertrial interval for both</page><page sequence="7">544 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION _ _ .. . . . ........ ... ._ _ , . _ . _ . _ . _ . j OTHER'S MY MINUTES EARNINGS EARNINGS REMAINING o a 0 SELF SELF (;O EXCHG 0 GIVE POINTS CHANGE GE o 0 GIVE TO GET Figure 1: Control Console subjects. Presses by the person whose GET light was lit had no effects. Thus. since exchange could only occur sequentially, only one person could produce points for the other on each exchange trial. The subjects controlled who could give and who could receive on each exchange trial with their CHANGE GIVE TO GET buttons. A press on the CHANGE button changed the presser's light from GIVE to GET, at the same time changing the other person's lights from GET to GIVE. If the other person wanted to receive points rather than give them on that trial, that person could reestablish the original situation by pressing the CHANGE button. There was no restriction on such back- and-forth use of the CHANGE buttons. On the other hand, one person would remain the giver trial after trial, as long as that person did not press the CHANGE button to (attempt to) become the receiver. Thus, the degree of expansion of exchange was controlled by the participants,</page><page sequence="8">Matthews, Shimoff / EXPANSION OF EXCHANGE 545 with strict alternation of gives constituting the lower bound of varia- tion. In the instruction period preceding the first session, subjects were given printed instructions presented concurrently by a tape recorder. Instructions (1) described the operation of the console and the method of payment; (2) indicated that there would usually be two 20-minute sessions per day, (3) informed the subjects that any session could be their last, depending on factors not under their control; and (4) told the subjects that they were free to do as they wished during sessions, as long as they did not damage the equipment. Subjects then received a brief (5-10 minute) period of experimenter-guided practice operating the console, including equal practice (20 trials) on both the independent and exchange options. Finally, any remaining questions about the operation of the console or method of payment were answered, and subjects signed consent forms. EXPERIMENT I: FREE EXCHANGE, ALTERNATION COST, AND TIME UNCERTAINTY In Experiment I, subjects' behavior was allowed to stabilize in the Free Exchange (baseline) procedure described above. For pairs in which exchange showed little or no expansion after at least three ses- sions of Free Exchange, an Alternation Cost contingency was in- troduced to provide a functional analog of situations in which higher levels of trust are associated with potentially higher outcomes for both parties. The Alternation Cost contingency was introduced by the fol- lowing note: "Each time either person operates his CHANGE button, 2 points will be subtracted from both persons' totals." This contingency differentially reinforced trust by making it costly to closely alternate gives. That is, point subtractions could be avoided during exchange by giving more times in succession. The risk, of course, was that, following a series of gives which put the other person ahead (during which the giver earned no points), the receiver could switch to independent work rather than reciprocating. Interest centered on whether such a con- tingency would produce expanded exchange and what its develop- mental course would be. In the Time Uncertainty procedure, reciproca- tion was made uncertain by setting subjects' clocks to 10 rather than 20 minutes at the start of the session and providing the following written instruction: "Note that there are only 10 minutes showing on the clock.</page><page sequence="9">546 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION The session will actually last longer than 10 minutes, but you have no way of knowing how much longer. That is, the session may shut off at any time once the clock reaches zero." Interest here focused on the effects of a reduction in probability of reciprocation on degree of expansion of exchange. Finally, trust levels were observed under a Combination of 5-point Alternation Cost and Time Uncertainty. Here, ,he cost contingency made closely alternated exchange costly, while Time Uncertainty made higher levels of trust increasingly risky. Six pairs were used in Experiment I. RESULTS Figure 2 shows variations in trust over trials and conditions for Pair 2. The horizontal broken line in each panel is an "equal earnings" line denoting a zero difference between the cumulative earnings of person A and person B during each session. Sessions are separated by black triangles on the X-axis. Each unit on the Y-axis represents a one-give (9-point) difference in favor of person A (above the line) or person B (below). Every give either produces a larger difference in favor of the other person (trust responses) or reduces the difference by reciprocating the other person's previous gives (trustworthy responses). Levels of trust are defined by how far each person puts the other ahead; that is, by the magnitude of the earnings differences produced by each. During independent work, earnings differences remain constant because both persons earn the same amount on every trial. In Pair 2, subjects consistently exchanged during the Free Exchange baseline (only trials 191 and on are shown), rather than working inde- pendently. Levels of trust remained minimal, however, with neither person ever putting the other more than one give ahead. At trial 284, the 2-point Alternation Cost contingency was introduced. Following a brief disruption of exchange, trust increased dramatically and with unusual abruptness. When the cost contingency was removed at trial 480, exchange remained expanded. We found this in every pair but one (Pair 9, Experiment II). Given that trustworthiness has been demonstrated, subjects appear to find expanded exchange more efficient and less effortful. In the session beginning at trial 582, clocks were set at 10 rather than the usual 20 minutes, and the Time Uncertainty instruction was given. A sharp decrease in trust can be seen after the subjects' clocks reached zero at trial 632. Following a return to Free Exchange, Time Uncertainty was reinstated in combination with 5-point Alterna-</page><page sequence="10">547 1 PAIR 2 30 20 AHEAD. / 0 - ?-- --- 10 FREE EXCHANGE 2-PT ALTERNATION COST 190 210 230 252 270 290 310 330 350 370 390 410 430 30 10 LA. cn 0-- - = 1 2-PT ALT COST FREE EXCHANGE FREE EXG 20 - 440 460 480 500 520 540 560 58o 600 620 640 660 630 30 20 FREE EXCHANGE ALTERNATION COAT FREE EXCHANGE 690 710 /30 750 770 790 810 830 8so 870 890 910 930 TR I A L S Figure 2: Response Record for Pair 2, Showing Trust Levels (earnings differences) over Trials and Conditions</page><page sequence="11">548 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION tion Cost (trial 812). Under these conditions, the subjects switched to independent work until Free Exchange was reintroduced. Except for the unusual abruptness with which exchange expanded after the introduction of Alternation Cost, the response record for Pair 2 (Figure 2) is representative for all pairs, with the following dif- ferences. In Pair 6, when Alternation Cost was introduced, person A immediately gave 17 times in succession. Person B then switched to independent work for the remainder of the session. Expanded exchange was never reestablished during eight subsequent sessions, and the pair was dismissed. In Pair 4, exchange began to expand gradually during the Free Exchange baseline, which was therefore left in place until the degree of expansion appeared stable (seven sessions). The sequence of conditions for Pair 4 was: Free Exchange, Time Uncertainty, Free Exchange, 2-point Cost, 5-point Cost, 5-point Cost and Time Un- certainty, Free Exchange. In Pairs 1 and 5 the Time Uncertainty instruc- tions had only moderate effects and were therefore repeated. In Pairs 1, 3, and 5 the effect of the combination of 5-point Cost and Time Un- certainty was to reduce levels of trust without disrupting exchange. Summary results for Experiment I are shown in Table 1, which presents maximum numbers of gives by which each person was ahead (maximum trust by partner) during each condition. Experiment I found that exchange in most pairs showed little tendency to expand until a specified incentive for greater trust (Alterna- tion Cost) was provided. With that incentive, however, trust gradually and progressively increased, remaining high when the incentive was subsequently removed. However, when reciprocation was made uncertain (Time Uncertainty), trust levels decreased dramatically. These findings replicate those reported by Matthews (1977). In the pair (Pair 6) in which one partly failed to reciprocate the other's initiation of expanded exchange, expanded exchange was never reestablished.' Finally, a combination of a strong incentive for high trust and un- certainty of reciprocation produced a cessation of exchange in two pairs and much reduced trust in three pairs. These results indicate the sensitivity of trust as defined here to incentive conditions which en- courage greater trust, to untrustworthy behavior by one party (Pair 6), and to situational constraints which reduce the likelihood of reciproca- tion. 1. Therefore, Pair 6 is not shown in Table 1.</page><page sequence="12">~~~~E Cn t V ) C) . .. .. -: C)) C) , - n oo V) CI V) M 00 Ln~~ C CD i n v 4- CD C) C)OCr k 0 0 M t 0 U vr, V), &lt;, &lt;, &lt;, JD~~~~~V)t4 ho O S on C)&gt;4 f C) r - * CO N-N C) &gt;- O LL1 a ct ?L a3 m ,~ ~ C X V) . t N ? k o b ?

Exchange Uncertainty was introduced by providing printed instructions at the start of a session which informed subjects that the exchange option would stop working some time during the last 10 minutes of the session, with only independent work available there- after. This procedure also makes reciprocation uncertain and should be functionally equivalent to Time Uncertainty in its effects on trust levels. Five new pairs were used in Experiment II. RESULTS The response record for Pair 7 is shown in Figure 3. In this pair, exchange showed a slight and inconsistent tendency to expand during the Free Exchange baseline. Following the introduction of 2-point Alter- nation Cost (trial 270), a high level of trust by person A was observed, which became bilateral when the Free Exchange condition was rein- troduced. Trust levels decreased sharply, however, when reciprocation became uncertain: Exchange Uncertainty instructions were given at trial 566, and subjects' clocks reached 10 minutes remaining at trial 618. The exchange option shut off at the arrow (trial 632). Exchange again expanded during Free Exchange and during 5-point Alternation Cost, but the combination of 5-point Cost and Exchange Uncertainty (trial 812) resulted in a cessation of exchange. Maximally expanded exchange can be seen during the final return to Free Exchange. Figure 3 is representative of all pairs in Experiment II, with the exception of Pair 9. In that pair, exchange did not remain expanded when the Alternation Cost contingency was removed. Therefore, Exchange Uncertainty was introduced in combination, first with 2- point Alternation Cost, later with 7-point Cost. Results for Experiment H1, summarized in Table 2, are consistent with those from Experiment I, and a comparison of Tables I and 2 indicates the functional equivalence of the Time Uncertainty and Exchange Uncertainty procedures.</page><page sequence="14">551 A P A I R 7 lHE AD ,_ \ _ AHEAD FREE FXCHANGE 0 20 40 60 SO io 00 1 4D 1i60 180 200 220 240 DO - 20.' 25 - 2-PT ALTERNATION COST FREE EXCHANGE Lai \ 30D , 3 5 6 8. 00 3AD 3EA DEE 38D 6 00 4DD 64 60 F4D 80 DA5DD 060 10.: 6&amp;C FREE2ECHNGE EE_____ FE EXCEAN /GE 9=/ 0-FT DLIFFDI -0-TCO 500 520 540 5 D0 580 60 D 620 640 660 AD O 7O 0 60 D 7O 4 2 0 - .'

In both procedures, sharp reductions in trust were observed. These findings are important for demonstrating that trust as defined here varies with probability of reciprocation in an intuitively sensible way. In both experiments, the likelihood of reciprocation was reduced by a situa- tional uncertainty affecting the other person's ability to reciprocate. Another class of situation, however, is that in which the likelihood of reciprocation by the other person is reduced while his ability to do so is not constrained. We arranged such a situation in Experiment III with our Temptation procedure. In Experiment III, at the start of a session, after trust levels had increased enough to provide a comparative baseline, pairs were in- structed that if either person finished that session with an earnings total 20 or more points greater than the other's, that person would receive a bonus of $20.00 and the other person would be penalized $2.00. Subjects were also reminded that if they were 20 or more points ahead at any time, they could secure the bonus by switching to independent work for the remainder of the session. Thus, in Experiment III, trust levels were monitored during transitions to and from a situation containing strong incentives for nonreciprocation. Six new pairs were used, and the value of each give was raised to 10 points so that subjects could more easily keep track of earnings differences from trial to trial. RESULTS Pairs 13 and 15 produced response records like that shown for Pair 14 (Figure 4). Trust levels progressively increased during Free Ex- change; the increased payoff difference between exchange and inde- pendent work may have made such expansion more likely. The effect of the Temptation procedure, introduced at trial 198, is clearly visible. Neither person ever put the other more than one give ahead while Tempation was in effect. Exchange expanded immediately when Free Exchange was reinstated (trial 290). In Pair 12 (Figure 5) A put B 20 points ahead during Temptation at trial 224. B immediately switched to independent work, but later (trial 242) switched back to exchange, giving up the $20.00 bonus.</page><page sequence="17">554 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION A AHEAD AHEAD FREE EXCHANG.E\ / 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 18o 200 C.)

Summary results for Experiment III are presented in Table 3. DISCUSSION The three experiments reported in this article employed a procedure for the experimental analysis of trust in ongoing exchange relations. Variations in trust, defined in explicitly behavioral terms, were con- tinuously monitored over time and conditions. Results showed that trust varied as it should for our use of the term to be consistent with traditional usages. In most pairs, trust increased gradually, even in the presence of a contingency (Altuernation Cost) which made low levels of trust costly. The developmental course of expansion of exchange observed in the laboratory closely resembled that described by Blau (1968: 454), who posited that, typically, "exchange relations evolve in a slow process,</page><page sequence="19">556 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION 10 PAiR 16 A AHEAD AHEAD FREE EXCHANGE 2-PT ALTERNATION COST 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 1So 200 220 240 20 LA&amp; 10 (No GRAPH FOR TRIALS 360-438 SEE TEXT 2-PT ALTERNATION COST Cl) 2-PT ALTERNATION COST AND -PT ALT 10 'A TEMPTATION COST _ 0 -- I - rrI I X I I I j I ^ I t 24J 260 280 300 320 340 360 380 400 420 440 460 480 LU 20 10 0 - 2-PT ALTERNATION COST 2-PT ALT ANDPT ALTERNATION4 COST COST TEMPTATION 480 500 520 540 560 580 600 620 640 660 680 700 720 Figure 6: Response Record for Pair 16 starting with minor transactions in which little trust is required because little risk is involved." Based on findings from previous studies of trust (see review by Lindskold, 1978), most of which employed matrix-game formats, the progressive and reciprocal increases in trust observed in our subject-pairs probably reflect specific aspects of our procedures. In particular, because initial gives necessarily implied vulnerability to exploitation, there could be little ambiguity about the giver's inten-</page><page sequence="20">00 -- b o C) C) C) C ) Pq vm r - 5 Cl O _ N~ Cl . -m -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~D Ho -~~~~~~~~~~~~~o k ;:~~~~~~~ LI) o w- O?o oc oc C) L Q I ) .0 o *N * n) ..)?

Our procedures also allowed trust to increase gradually over a larger number of exchanges. Our results indicate, however, that even in fully expanded exchange maintained over several sessions, trust levels remain sensitive to situational factors associated with probability of reciprocation: Dramatic decreases in trust were observed when likelihood of reciprocation was reduced. The Uncertainty manipulations (Experiments I and II) were funda- mentally different from the Temptation manipulation (Experiment III), although both had similar effects on trust levels. Uncertainty intro- duced situational constraints which affected the likelihood that the other person would be able to reciprocate (in the lawn-mowing example, an analogous situation would be one in which both persons hold jobs subject to short-notice geographical transfer). Temptation, on the other hand, involved no such external constraint. Consistent with existing literature (Schlenker et al., 1973), trust in the latter case might be distinguished as "interpersonal." The utility of such a distinction would be shown by the differential effects of other variables. For example, the introduction of a bilateral capacity to punish untrustworthy behavior might facilitate the maintenance of high trust levels during Temptation, while having no effects during Uncertainty. The within-subjects methodology used here can provide much information about the developmental course of effects, transitions between conditions, and details of individual performances. Although this approach tends to highlight individual differences, we were im- pressed by the limited range of such differences observed in these experi- ments. Apparently, subjects came to the laboratory with similar histories of experience in relevant nonlaboratory settings, which, in turn, may indicate the ubiquity of exchange relations and problems of trust in everyday life. Among the questions that should be addressed by future research, two may have particular practical relevance. First, we need to know more about the general conditions under which trust may be increased between hostile parties. After one member of Pair 6 (Experiment I) failed to reciprocate the other's gives, expanded exchange was never reestablished, even though experimental procedures (Alternation Cost) encouraged "graduated reciprocation" or step-by-step trust increases which some theorists identify as crucial for conflict reduction (Osgood, 1962; Etzioni, 1967; Lindskold, 1978). It is possible that simple pro- cedural changes (such as allowing verbal communication between participants) could be effective in some cases (but see Pilisuk and</page><page sequence="22">Matthews, Shimof / EXPANSION OF EXCHANGE 559 Skolnik, 1968); alternatively, it may be that trust ordinarily cannot be established between hostile parties in the absence of explicit threats or guarantees by third parties. Second, Experiment III found that a strong incentive for nonreciprocation (Temptation) produced dramatic de- creases in trust, even when low trust levels were costly to the partici- pants. We are currently investigating procedures which may allow expanded exchange to be reliably developed and maintained in the presence of incentives for untrustworthy behavior. REFERENCES BLAU, P.
