In a similar vein, the chromatic ascents in the run-up to the recapitu- lation (bars 252-4), interpreted by Grayson as the piano '[facing] the inevitable and [dealing] with the consequences' (loc. cit.) could be cast in a more positive, co-operative light, as they prepare the way for the chromatic ascents in the piano and strings in bars 261-7. In spite of doubts about Grayson's interpreta- tions, I question neither the validity of his general approach to anthropomorphic description nor the engaging nature of his prose. This style of writing has a long and venerable tradition in the context of Mozart's piano concertos, and is a very reasonable way of conveying their 'dramatic' intensity. Gray- son's descriptions of K.466 and 467 will encourage readers to think afresh about these familiar con- certos, even if they happen not to agree with the specifics of his interpretations. Grayson's final chapter is a useful, succinct summary of issues relating to performance prac- tice. With keen attention to recent writings, he carefully negotiates contentious problems of impro- vised embellishment, cadenzas and lead-ins, basso continuo performance, pedal pianos and orchestral sizes and seatings. Where necessary, he is sensibly reconciliatory, proposing as a compromise in the col basso debate that the fortepianist establishes an immediate 'presence' within the orchestra but without making a substantial 'sonic impact' (p. 107). Equally, he is wise to recommend con- ventions of improvised embellishment 'not as a straitjacket but as a springboard' for individual performers (p. 101). In sum, Grayson upholds the high scholarly standards of the Cambridge Music Handbooks series, simultaneously offering general readers a solid introduction to the Mozart piano concerto repertory, and K.466 and 467 in particular. All readers will find much to admire in his analyses, especially the clarity of their formal description, and in his discussion of performance practice; the general reader will benefit in particular from his summaries of twentieth-century formal theories. In fact, Grayson's book is well attuned to Mozart's own famous pronouncement about his first three Viennese piano concertos, K.413, 414 and 415: 'There are passages here and there from which the connoisseurs alone can derive satisfaction; but these passages are written in such a way that the less learned cannot fail to be pleased'. SIMON P. KEEFE Mozart in Revolt: Strategies of Resistance, Mischief and Deception. By David Schroeder. pp. x + 211. (Yale University Press, New Haven &amp; London, 1999, ?25. ISBN 0-300-07542-1.) The correspondence of the Mozart family is one of the mainstays of biographies of the composer. The early journeys through northern Europe are known primarily through Leopold Mozart's letters to Lorenz Hagenauer in Salzburg, while the three visits to Italy are vividly detailed in letters from Leopold to his wife and daughter back at home. Over recent years, biographers have relied heavily on the correspondence between Mozart and his father during the composer's ill-fated tour through Germany to Paris in 1777-9 for an understanding of their fragmenting relationship. Our knowledge of the extraordinary saga of Mozart's break from the Salzburg court and his establishment in Vienna in 1781 depends almost entirely on the letters to his father. There is little documentary evidence about his marriage to Constanze or the other aspects of his life in Vienna such as his financial hardship, so here again the letters are of vital importance. Music historians have for many years warned against the dangers of taking the letters at face value. There were many occasions on which Mozart deliberately misled his father and other correspondents. David Schroeder goes further in questioning the veracity of this biographical source, by arguing that the letters should be placed within the traditions of eighteenth-century epistolary style. The writings of the Mozart family are vehicles for different types of discourse, each with their own conventions and rhetoric, and should be read within this context. The central and most interesting sections of this book are devoted to Leopold Mozart's letters and his literary ambitions. The basic premiss is that Leopold planned a biography of his son. However, instead of using the correspondence as an aide- memoire for the future book, the letters were them- selves to form an epistolary biography. Leopold therefore wrote his letters with a view to later publication, and planned to incorporate both them and his son's replies into the book. The model he followed was that of the moral education of a son by a father, based on the discourses of the most distinguished German Enlightenment author of his generation, Christian Ftirchtegott Gellert. Leopold intended the centrepiece of this biography to be the correspondence with his son during the latter's journeys of 1777-9. He wrote his letters to inform and educate his son about life, success and how to behave in society. Such an education might of course encounter disagreement and difficulties, 101</page><page sequence="2">but this was not a problem provided that in the end the son acknowledged the force of his father's advice and enlightened morality triumphed. Schroeder argues that this biographical venture was intended to praise Wolfgang while creating for Leopold himself a lasting place in literature. How- ever, Wolfgang became increasingly aware of the fundamental differences between his own desires and aims and those of his father. He consequently developed a subtle blend of truth and deceit in his side of the correspondence which undermined and ultimately destroyed this literary endeavour. The implication of this argument is that the exchange between father and son should be read with an eye to the conventions of the eighteenth-century epis- tolary tract, and not as the simple depiction of the spontaneous moods and attitudes of the writers. Schroeder's thesis is developed very convin- cingly, and helps account for many aspects of Leopold's behaviour. He lays the groundwork by recounting Leopold's involvement with German literati in the 1750s and '60s. The success of his violin tutor gave him an entree to the 'republic of letters', where he fell under the influence of Goethe's teacher Gellert. Gellert encouraged a tasteful and natural style of letter-writing in which the moral element was always present. It is simplistic to conclude that Leopold abandoned his own career to dedicate himself to his son's educa- tion. Rather, he saw his career developing on literary lines, with the epistolary biography as its culmination. This motive accounts for his obsessive insistence that his letters be preserved and for the inclusion of obvious pieces of advice in them. Since he was writing for posterity, it was important that even issues that were well understood within the family were properly expounded. Schroeder has been able to identify forerunners for many of Leopold Mozart's moral observations in the literary models supplied by Gellert. In the early stages of the journey north with his mother, Wolfgang played his designated role in the project. He was relatively open in recounting his activities, responded to Leopold's admonitions with dutiful sentiments, and attempted to trivialize the incidents in which he departed from high moral behaviour. Yet as the journey progressed, he became more elusive. His passion for Aloysia Weber was seen as a challenge by his father; Leopold's moral lessons would be even more striking if they could be effective at a distance and in the face of romance, and Wolfgang's passion elicited some of Leopold's most vivid letters. But the real change in Wolfgang's part of the exchange took place in Paris and is attributed to the influence of Louise d'Epinay. Mme d'Epinay came into contact with Mozart through her liaison with Baron Grimm and was an important literary figure in her own right. She had been intimate with Rousseau and counted Voltaire and Diderot among her closest friends. She wrote extensively on politics and philosophy and was an inveterate letter-writer. Schroeder argues that Wolfgang learnt new subtleties of correspondence from her, together with an ability to tolerate ambiguity and deception in relationships. This became evident in the letters from Paris and during the slow return to Salzburg. In these, Mozart was in turn 'ingratiat- ing, thanking, praising, calming, stroking, cajol- ing-in short, lying his way through ten critical months of correspondence' (p. 115). Mozart was particularly successful in laying a trail of confusion about his compositional activity in Paris. He may even have invented non-existent works such as a second symphony and an opera, to satisfy his father. In his replies to Leopold, he evaded scrutiny by changing the subject abruptly, often coupling serious discussion with trivial anec- dotes. The most striking examples can be found in the letters recounting his mother's illness and death. In the famous letter that Mozart wrote to his father after his mother had died, falsely report- ing that she was merely ill, he followed this news with anecdotes concerning a recent concert, dis- cussion of servants' wages, and the supposed opera. More than two-thirds of his next letter (in which he describes her death) is taken up with other matters. Leopold Mozart's efforts to maintain the literary tradition with a calm moralizing stance crumbled in the face of these evasions. In the later months of the journey, he was reduced to impotent fury, increasingly embarrassed by the discrepancy between the stories he had put about in Salzburg concerning his son's success, and the reality. While the general thesis about the motives underlying the correspondence is compelling, I find this interpretation of Leopold Mozart's state of mind during the months between his wife's death in 1778 and his son's return to Salzburg not entirely convincing. In retrospect, it is easy to see these months as a transitional phase of matura- tion, and as Mozart's temporary failure to respond to the realities of a cosmopolitan working life. But at the time, Leopold may have been deeply dis- tressed by the genuine possibility that his son had burnt out compositionally and that he was not going to establish himself in the adult world as a serious talent. Mozart's deceit and musical inactiv- ity may have signalled the demise not only of Leopold's literary ambitions but of the genius of his son too. Leopold was not to know that within a 102</page><page sequence="3">few months Wolfgang was to allay these fears with an outpouring of profound works. A separate chapter is devoted to discussion of Mozart's letters to his cousin Maria Anna Thekla (the Basle). Schroeder places the scatology of these letters into the context of the ribaldry of the commedia dell'arte and its German manifestations. He shows that authors from Hans Sachs to Goethe had indulged in similar imagery and wordplay as part of a long carnival tradition. He justly castigates psychoanalytically-minded biographers for analys- ing the 'deeper' meaning of these writings without taking account of the cultural context. The Baisle letters are just as much literary creations, albeit in a different genre, as Mozart's letters to his father. Other aspects of the book are less felicitous. Schroeder presents a contrast between the anarchic carnival and the sobriety of the ordered moderation of the Enlightenment. He places Wolfgang in the carnival tradition, opposing the Enlightenment sentiments of Leopold Mozart, the Emperor Joseph II and even Joseph Haydn. This argument is not convincing. It forces Schroeder into conclud- ing that Mozart found Freemasonry stifling and sanctimonious, which is hardly consistent with his persistent attendance and involvement even after the Order had suffered official restraint. It also suggests a less than rounded perspective on Mozart's music, with its combination of joyous vivacity, serenity and ordered structure. Mozart's correspondence in his later years is treated in a cursory fashion. Schroeder has little to say about the letters to his father in 1783 and beyond, even though these contain fascinating material concerning his daily life and musical activity. The famous letter sent to Leopold shortly before the latter's death in 1787 is scarcely men- tioned. This letter has been regarded as a profound exposition of Mozart's Masonic philosophy by some biographers, and as a series of insincere platitudes by others, and the issues of truth and deceit are particularly relevant to its interpretation. Mozart's letters to several other correspondents survive from his later years. It is apparent to anyone who reads his letters to his wife, to his friend Jacquin or to Michael Puchberg that he adopted different tones and styles with different corres- pondents. He was in turn cheerful, shy, facetious, sentimental and sombre. Schroeder seems to do little more than dissect these patterns, with an underlying feeling that this diversity is somehow reprehensible. One might argue that Mozart's variation in style is a model to which many writers might aspire, effectively matching the tone of the writing to the recipient and content. Speculations are put forward that appear ill digested compared with the carefully constructed arguments in the earlier sections of the book. Thus it is suggested, on the basis of a single passing remark, that Mozart may have had the idea that his own corres- pondence with Constanze should be preserved for publication. Schroeder also argues that the ded- ication of the six strong quartets to Haydn in 1785 may have been partly ironic. The reasoning behind this is that since the paternal relationship was so difficult for Mozart, portraying Haydn as the 'father' of the quartets could not have been sincere. Schroeder appears sometimes to fall into the trap about which he has warned other commentators, interpreting the contents of Mozart's writings with- out considering their cultural and literal context. It is a disappointing end to a stimulating discussion of one of the most famous literary exchanges in musical history. ANDREW STEPTOE Mozart and the English Connection. By John Jenkins. pp. xii + 171. (Cygnus Arts, London, 1998, ?20. ISBN 1-900541-60-2.) John Jenkins's work on the medical profession in Mozart's day and his attempts to apply the tools of his profession to the medical circumstances sur- rounding the composer's death have provided a valuable specialist insight from outside the musico- logical profession and have been widely appre- ciated. He has now written a book of quite another kind that usefully assembles a broad range of material on Mozart's connections with England and the English. His preface highlights the fact that this is a book 'written for the general reader . . . rather than to give a detailed analysis and evaluation of his music for scholars'. Such a study is to be welcomed. There is relatively little on Mozart and the English, and what already exists is quite widely dispersed: the Mozart family corres- pondence provides one perspective, complemented in a fragmentary way by newspaper notices, private diaries and published memoirs. Taken together, Pohl's 1867 Mozart und Haydn in England, Emily Anderson's translation of the correspondence, sup- plemented by the JNeue Mozart-Ausgabe's Briefe und Aufzeichnungen, Deutsch's Mozart: a Documentary Biography, Cliff Eisen's New Mozart Documents and Peter Clive's Mozart and his Circle-the last-named absent from Jenkins's bibliography-offer a pretty full picture, recently updated by Ian Woodfield's 'New Light on the Mozarts' London Visit' (Music &amp; Letters, lxxvi (1995), 187-208). Jenkins's book conflates material from an impressive range of relevant primary sources (some of the private 103</page></plain_text>
