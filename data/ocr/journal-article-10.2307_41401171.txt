<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fred Muratori Ambiguity Isrì t What It Used to Be- Or Is It? * While riding a bus to work recently, I noticed these words stenciled on a panel above the rear exit: TO OPEN DOOR IN EMERGENCY BREAK COVER PUSH HANDLE Just like that, unpunctuated and in capitals. Though the literal message- "if there's an emergency and you need to get out through this door, break the panel and push the handle you find inside"- should have been obvious, I was unable to fathom it at first. Because there were no syntactical guides, like commas or articles, my imagination embraced the words as if they composed a poem, end-stopping each line ("To open door in. / Emergency break. / . . .") and assigning inappropriate, if generally valid, grammatical functions for cer- tain words (as in, "It's almost time for my emergency break"), treating nouns as verbs ("I'd better cover that push handle before it rains") or vice versa. To the mild distress of the woman sitting across from me, I laughed as I considered the poetic possibilities of what was intended to soberly convey a procedure that panicky passengers would be able to follow in the event the bus were hijacked by Dennis Hopper. Several days after this experience, I realized that it had more significance than I had thought, since in a sense it represented a small triumph for post- modernism, a minor victory in the battle for one theory-besieged, overly receptive brain. I had finally, quite unconsciously and over many years, learned to mistrust language, to accept instability and indeterminacy as its defining qualities.

I had applied a "textual strategy" to a real-life situation, without assuming any confusing pointers to all those pesky referents in the physical universe. My reaction also prompted me to consider how our current ideas of poetic ambiguity and difficulty might compare with those identified by Wil- liam Empson and T. S. Eliot in the 1930's. While writing Seven Types of Am- biguity , Empson never had to worry about John Ashbery or Leslie Scalapino. He had read Gertrude Stein (in fact, his own "Poem About a Ball in the 19th Century" reflects her influence), but he found her puzzling, confessing in Seven Types that Stein's work "implores the passing tribute of a sigh." He speculated that to understand such unaccommodating poetry, "one might have to learn a great deal about the mode of action of language which is not yet known " But had Empson chosen to probe critically the experimental verse of his time, would our libraries now hold copies of Nine Types of Ambiguity ? Would Eliot have enumerated more than the four varieties of poetic diffi- culty identified in his Harvard lectures of 1933 if he had foreseen that Charles Bernstein was slouching toward Buffalo to be born? Submerged in Empson's reluctance to engage Stein's apparent opacity is the implication that our knowledge of language, of its "mode of action," would progress, like our knowledge of medicine or astronomy. But just such an awareness had already surfaced in the writings of Ferdinand de Saussure, Viktor Shkovsky, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. As critic Marjorie Perloff has suggested, the cutting edge of contemporary poetics was forged in large part from the conceptual union of the two Steins, Gertrude and Wittgen-, and the critical writing they inspired aims to furnish us with tools helpful in approach- ing otherwise impenetrable poems. On the other hand, Christopher Norris notes (in William Empson cmd the Philosophy of Literary Criticism) that the Empson of The Structure of Complex Words began to develop ideas not so removed from Wittgenstein's after all- another indication that, stripped of their more politically specific propositions and in-group jargon, postmodernist approaches to poetry may have more in common with the old New Criticism than some would acknowledge. The five books under discussion here are to varying degrees difficult, in that they challenge the boundaries of ambiguity as defined (ambiguously) by Empson, and they approach most of the categories set out by Eliot in The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism . As Eliot saw it, the difficulty of modern poetry could be attributed to one or more of the following: ( 1 ) a poet's find- ing it impossible to express him- or herself "in any but an obscure way" due to "personal causes," (2) novelty, as when poets write in an unprecedented manner that takes the reading audience by surprise, (3) the reader's being in-</page><page sequence="3">144 THE GEORGIA REVIEW formed in advance that a particular work will be difficult, resulting in the ex- pectation that it will be, and (4) the poet's leaving out "something which the reader is used to finding; so that the reader, bewildered, gropes about for what is absent"- in other words, the withholding of accepted poetic conventions or clear references to the recognizable world. In the half century or more since Eliot wrote his lecture, poetry has passed through many innovative phases; still, these four conditions remain essentially valid. Eliot's point about absence is especially important, since most of us find it natural to seek out the familiar when traveling in unfamiliar territory: a McDonald's in Marrakesh, a Motel 6 in Plattsburgh. When reading poetry, we expect to encounter an honest face or a firm handshake, the confidant that real life never seems to provide for us, a room that resembles the one in which we sleep when we dream that we are asleep. But much of the poetry we readily describe as experimental or difficult denies us these things. It appears to thrust full responsibility for ascertaining its meaning squarely on us, with little or no assistance forthcoming from the poet. Rather than offer comfort, such poetry leaves us uneasily alone with ourselves and with our powers of discernment. * Highly regarded for her translations of the avant-garde French poet Edmond Jabès, Rosmarie Waldrop knows something about absence and dislocation. As a schoolgirl in Germany during World War II, Waldrop had firsthand ex- perience of air raids and blackouts. She began to learn English as a result of the American occupation that followed. In the early 1950's she met a recently discharged US Army soldier (now her husband, Keith Waldrop), and some years later both moved to the United States, where they plunged energetically into graduate studies, writing, and translating. In the 1960's they founded Burning Deck press, one of the most respected venues for adventuresome poetry of the last thirty years. As a non-native speaker of English, Waldrop evinces a sense of the lan- guage at once granular and sweeping, skeptical and reverent. She pays atten- tion and then some. The accurately titled Another Language showcases se- lections from her eleven books published over twenty-five years, and in the earliest poems as well as in more recent work one senses her testing words as if they were complex and volatile substances, toying dangerously with syntax, trying somehow to weigh and substantiate the spaces where words fall short of intention and where doubt undermines assertion. Severely economical and staunchly resistant to paraphrase, her poems debate and argue with themselves, posit evidence, search for clues, and assume nothing. They seem to venture tentatively out onto the page, like planetary explorers who know that they must stay in their suits but yearn to breathe a new, untried atmosphere:</page><page sequence="4">FRED MURATORI I45 The room's no longer dissolves in a rhythm from inside my eye what we just started to talk of water seems to rise black and insistent boats take off lights grow small talk is so difficult two pairs of eyes see two different initial questions too disappear as in a dream the body thinks against itself This is a section from "As If We Didn't Have to Talk," which appeared in Waldrop's first major book, The Aggressive Ways of the Casual Stranger (her titles are anything but ordinary), issued in 1972 by Random House (of all places). Note the complete absence of punctuation and internal capitaliza- tion. In poems like this one we might discover what Empson called the con- dition of "fortunate confusion, as when the author is discovering his idea in the act of writing or not holding it all in the mind at once"- the fifth type of ambiguity. Without conventional syntactical cues this poem, like my cryptic bus sign, requires very close reading, a willingness to entertain multiple staged possibilities (which is disappearing, "pairs of eyes" or "questions?"), and a tolerance- or even desire- for ambiguity. The speaker seems to be in a room overlooking a waterway, most likely at night ("lights grow small"), and some crisis of communication, an impasse, has just occurred. We read of the con- sequences: withdrawal, intentions receding as the boats recede, a defeated return inward. The parties involved can't agree on the premises of their failed discus- sion ("two sets of eyes / see / two different initial / questions too"), and so the matter ends bitterly, as once again the self- through lack of courage or knowledge- has sabotaged its own chances to be understood. The fourth line ("what we just started to talk of") illustrates a favorite Waldrop device, in which she appears to omit part of a sentence, to abandon the thought and fol- low it immediately with another. Elsewhere in this poem we encounter such uncompleted lines as "but as long as we're," "and in a while we'll," and "it's enough that we're," phrases forever on the brink of defining a state or con- dition for both the speaker and one (probably male) other, enterprises lost</page><page sequence="5">146 THE GEORGIA REVIEW with the realization that no one can accurately speak for anyone else or really know another's intent. Spare as it looks, the passage quoted above imparts a more vivid sense of yearning and failure, of loss and futility, than many more loquacious, auto- biographical poems. In refusing to employ the facile clutter of literary psy- choanalysis, Waldrop moves as close as she can to the undeceived language of the blood, what our bodies "think against" the inadequate, inhibiting ideas of self we've constructed. This notion of self-impediment, of resistance from within seen as the byproduct of using a language that fails to effect its social missions in mutually satisfying ways, recurs throughout the poem, as in the lines "I need a book to say / I love you" and uthe questions I / live in are always too big." If, as the bestseller has it, men are from Mars and women are from Venus, then in Waldrop's work the two occupy different galaxies altogether. Though she establishes identifiable continuities of concern, Waldrop's penchant for writing poetic series that do not follow obvious causal trajec- tories allows her to sidestep the reader's narrative expectations. By incorporat- ing the uncertainty, the self-revising twist and turn of thought itself, not to mention the tensile pressure of a barely sublimated eroticism, she makes the most of aphoristic statement. On any given page we are likely to confront small but complex assertions like "it's not enough to think to see" or "he has a / female muscle / camouflaged / for impact." No wonder, then, that her more recent work nods directly toward Wittgenstein, for whom the single sentence and short paragraph were the preferred units of expression. With The Reproduction of Profiles (1987), Shorter American Memory (1988), and Lawn of Excluded Middle (1993), Waldrop moved from the harshly amputated line- she's admitted in an interview that her lines had "gotten rather painfully short"- to Wittgenstein's paragraph form. You'd think that her opening up of her style even a little, to the meandering pleasures of dependent and independent clauses, compound sentences, and the like, would ease her concern with the limits of human communication. But in fact the stumbling blocks, especially those between men and women, are even more pronounced: If we could just go on walking through these woods and let the pine branches brush our faces, living would still make beads of sweat on your forehead, but vou wouldn't have to worry about what you call my exhibitionism. All you liked about trees was the way the light came through the leaves in sheets of precise, parallel rays, like slant rain. This may be an incomplete explanation of our relation, but we've always feared the dark inside the body. You agreed there could be no seduction if the structures of propositions did not stand in a physical relation, so that we could get one from the other. Even so, not every moment of happiness is to hang one's clothes on.</page><page sequence="6">FRED MURATORI 147 The now-familiar themes are here- the divided self ("we've always feared the dark inside the body") echoed externally by a divided couple, the apposite expectations, the dangerously mined battleground of spoken communication- but now they are complicated further by the addition of immediately appre- hensible syntax, setting up cause-and-effect relationships which are at the very least odd, and at the extreme outwardly impossible. What Waldrop seems to explore here is how grammar and syntax them- selves constitute a structural metaphor for persuasion: because prose sentences and paragraphs resist the bald artifice visually signaled by the poetic line, ap- proaching more closely the state of familiar or conversational speech, they more readily engage our confidence, our trust. But by posing subversive and difficult syllogisms, as in the first sentence of the quoted passage, or in "Be- cause I refuse to accept the opposition of night and day I must pit other, subtler periodicities against the emptiness of being an adult," (from Larum of Excluded Middle ), the poet sheds light on the mechanics of excuse-making and self- deception, on how we use language to invent logic systems that we hope will eventually get us off the hook for whatever wrong turns we've taken in our lives. It could be noted that such rhetorical strategies bear some similarity to those found in the poetry of John Ashbery, but Ashbery's patented delays and digressions, his shell games of hide-the-antecedent and pseudo-chummy asides, serve mostly to push his poems' subjects outward in a centrifugal spiral away from a central idea. Waldrop's energies are concentrated in the opposite di- rection, moving centripetally toward elusive but urgent conclusions that may not be definable but are at least illumined, however briefly. There are times when she verges on Ashbery's sense of parody and play; those moments are infrequent, though, and the mission beneath the words maintains a palpable urgency. She may not ever capture the Loch Ness Monster of true intentions that lurks below human interactions, but those blurry snapshots of what re- sembles a large flipper are reason enough to continue the search. Some say that American poetry collections these days are too voluminous- that poets confuse hefty page counts with substance- but in the case of Another Langtiage I wish we'd been given more. # Rosmarie Waldrop minimizes her use of poetic staples such as metaphor and visual imagery, and when she does use them there's a twist, as in "The Road Is Everywhere or Stop This Body," where the graphic reproduction of street signs functions as both text and omen. Paul Hoover's Viridian , conversely, is a veritable image-zoo, shimmering and vibrating with unruly visions for the mind's eye. Like Waldrop's, Hoover's reputation has grown considerably during the</page><page sequence="7">148 THE GEORGIA REVIEW past decade. As editor of the magazine New American Writing and of Post- modern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology , he has become prominent among experimental poets and has been identified by some as a student of the New York School-Chicago branch. At first blush, his poems could be com- fortable pagemates with those of James Tate or Charles Simic. Energetically surreal and lush with distortions, they endow anything and everything- furni- ture, insects, silence- with anthropomorphic qualities ("the afternoon grows tall then leans back in its window''). If an object can be imagined, then so can its history, its pet peeves, its inner life. What distinguishes Hoover's poetry from late-1960's American sur- realism (itself influenced by the European varieties) is his perspective on lan- guage and his overt use of language as the subject, not just the substance, of his poems. Juxtapositions and absurd investitures are intended less to flush out the unconscious than to create virtual realities, worlds generated from near nothingness that word-by-word build an identity and a physics apart from any we know. It's as if language were given its own desert island, the right to vote in free elections, and market access to China. What emerges is a weird republic where every thought and impression claims autonomy- each means what it means, and thus parallels or parodies the way we've already permitted our language, no matter how precisely imagined, to get the better of us: Beauty On its way from the yellow kitchen to a blue hole in the bedroom wall, a cockroach tottered over the floor, found the refuge it sought and thought: Beautiful , I made it, and the black and white TV, emitting nothing but static, was beautiful next to a snowy window, though the snow was dirty and the night dark. Beautiful , said the guest, you've spilled gravy on my designer dress. But it's pretty, merely pretty, how everything goes around, by way of leaving itself. An old position is a new place. The lake after rain, the new lake, freshens the gloom with damp. Pretty, how the house, seen from a corner angle, seems small and large at once, windows fat with thought. Pretty snow. Pretty flowers, pretty dead. I would rather , she said, transparent. She thought the boy was cute. He thought she was nice.</page><page sequence="8">FRED MURATORI 149 Here, on the desk, the beautiful (real) face of the angel is packed in plaster for twenty-five cents. Dead leaves on green grass. The bird's wing in the cat's mouth. I think when she said, I am happy , she meant that she was not. Beautiful , the red ants seething in water. Here is a case history of linguistic nuance running amok. An adjective meant to be applied within the context of aesthetic judgments becomes asso- ciated with the experiences of escape and relief, the mundane aspect of homely scenes, chagrin prompted by carelessness, and finally- in a stanza that turns murderously serious- dishonesty and death. "Pretty" goes through a similar gauntlet, and ends up in about the same place ("pretty dead," "Dead leaves on green grass"). The poem piles on alternate operational definitions of words we take for granted until whatever blind trust we've placed in them has worn away. Common usage, Empson notes in Seven Types , has flattened language so much that ". . . the word is used, as at a distance, to stand for a vague and com- plicated mass of ideas and systems which the journalist [or in this case, the poet] has no time to apprehend." But Hoover, like an adolescent with a chemis- try set, experiments playfully with language in an effort to make common words spark and fluoresce. He attempts to restore some of their complexity- indeed, their volatility- by placing them in unfamiliar contexts that force us to work beyond our assumptions. They are not allowed to stand as ciphers for concepts that we only pretend to understand. The complicated masquerade of meanings Hoover deposits in our laps won't sit still for our complete appre- hension; it can only be observed and extrapolated from. If "Beauty," in ad- dition to many other poems in this collection, demonstrates a principle, it is that our common language is anything but. Poetry like Hoover's sometimes works to its best advantage when read with slightly blurred vision. That is not meant negatively, because the same might be said of the paintings of Monet and Seurat. Look too closely, cross- examine the details for too long, and later on we might just dream of painted swaths of canvas instead of water lilies. Like paintings, poems leave visual im- pressions when apprehended quickly, and colorful poems leave colorful im- pressions. Hoover at his most imagistically impressionistic is what I would call glancingly accurate: Everything converted to fiction because of the passage of time, mythless histories that bent in the telling, like pencils placed in glasses of water.</page><page sequence="9">150 THE GEORGIA REVIEW To have said that history becomes fiction when acted on by the refractive powers of memory and imagination just wouldn't have the same dead-on force as that eccentric but classically placed simile. When it's in Hoover's interest to employ conventional weapons, he will do so. But best not probe the figure too deeply. Though the veracity of Hoover's image could be tested in the kitchen, its power derives from the memory of something we imagine we might have done in childhood, whether or not that memory is actually true. The simile fits the quirky, surreal landscape Hoover has created, one in which submerged pencils are as common as teakettles. Having appeared in print no fewer than four times prior to its appearance here, Hoover's "Baseball" resonates far more readily with the world many of us inhabit. Hoover, with characteristic ambivalence, considers not only base- ball's obvious sexual-political dimensions- "Play ball" is the message, the dream of male tradition passing and to come. Besides, those uniforms, so quasi-pseudo- semi-demi-military in fashion! They make us watch them swing their sticks; slide between another man's legs, as if that torso heaven were all the spit we're worth, we who sit and dream, eat and talk, as gulls stir over the field. -but also its dubious relationship to poetry: I can't say I agree. Poetry comes in your mouth like flesh. It rises to the surface like a ball held underwater, bouncing a little but staying there, hardly transcendental but present nevertheless. . . . Baseball, on the other hand, presents itself like air, love's green moment still, at two in the afternoon. A poem that ponders and digresses and reverses itself several times, "Baseball" indicates that poetry, "hardly transcendental," is the more physical and dy- namic of the two activities. Where poetry subversively engages the mind and its belief systems with a threatening persistence, baseball comforts with its static suspension of the idealized "green moment." For Hoover the two are</page><page sequence="10">FRED MURATORI 1 5 1 in fact antithetical, though implicitly the poet knows that for most Americans poetry is also a sentimental repository of idealization and solace. # It takes time to get used to Hoover's modus operandi- he seeds his poems with doubt at every turn, and just when one mystery appears to be solved, out drops a body from the next closet. This is less true in Amy Gerstler's Стоит of Weeds, although like Hoover she is a highly visual poet with both surrealist leanings and links to the art world. A Los Angeles native whose Bitter Angel was awarded the 1991 National Book Critics Circle Award for poetry. Gerst- ler calls to mind one of those improvisational comedians who solicits set- ups from the audience ("You're one of the Three Stooges and you've just discovered Relativity in the shower!") as framing devices for the ad-libbed skits that will follow. She adopts the gestures of narrative, of plot and progres- sion, for what are purely associative cascades of image and situation, glistening shards of poetic bric-a-brac extracted as if from Captain Kangaroo's cosmically huge pockets. Her titles alone- "Chain of Events," "Recipe for Trouble," "Montage of Disasters"- are usually sufficient to trigger the litanies that ensue. Other times, her first lines will pose a question like "How is this village differ- ent from all others?" or will introduce an eccentric speaker ("Hi. I sketch dead fish for a living"), or else will make a statement that demands elaboration ("Let me assure you my hallucinations / were beautiful"). One can almost hear an old Tonight Show audience shouting back in unison, "How beautiful were they?" Cast in lanky, relatively short-lined columns, Gerstler's poems avoid the sense of density and clutter that might otherwise plague them. "Her Account of Herself," a parody of contemporary autobiographical poems, illustrates Gerstler's affably chatty weirdness: Born at the onset of this tranquilizer age, I spent decades awakening, wandering this nation's dazzling displays of petticoats and neckties. I grew into a needle-nosed scribbler, a tight-lipped wallflower seated between lively philistines at banquets and sacrifices. Such am I: a barren head-hanger, a secret rabbit breeder, addicted to bonbons and collecting botanically accurate hand-tinted</page><page sequence="11">152 THE GEORGIA REVIEW etchings of flowering cacti since time out of mind. I kept my legs crossed just as instructed, for a hideously long time. I still have trouble telling the difference between progress and pathology, hate my face getting wet, will not eat banana squash, learned to ride a bike at twenty, experience difficulty warming up. Were there a museum of me, it might contain my fur muff, my pup's first leather collar . . . And so on for twenty-eight more lines. The accretion of odd, extended de- tails is potentially endless, while the promise of oblique social commentary ("this tranquilizer age") sputters out rather quickly. The poem ends with what could serve as a summary description not only of itself but of many other pieces in the book: Call upon me if you need contact with that breezy, self-conscious type of turmoil that chases its tail all day, forming little whirlwinds. Inventive as the improvisations are, they do eventually sound glib, "breezy." Though few poets have Gerstler's talent for keeping clichés at bay while un- scrolling veritable libraries of captivating and amusing fragments, she makes it seem almost too easy, too seamless, too modular. After a poem's general direction has been established in the first few lines, the rest of it often seems to be a series of interchangeable parts. At times the poet gets so involved with detail that she qualifies where no qualification is necessary, as in "The superior man picks up / a weathered shoe heel / nearly buried in the dust . . . ," which I suppose allays confusion from our thinking he picks up a shirt heel- though to be fair, in a surrealist's universe a weathered heel from a real foot might be just as likely a find. An overzealous love of adjectives causes trouble, too, in lines like ". . . spires you can just make out jutting up / from the besmirched, yet somehow cloudless horizon." What is it that would "besmirch" a "somehow cloudless horizon"? Besmirched how? And why "somehow cloudless"? The intrusion of vagaries in the midst of relentlessly specific detail serves no purpose, and the non se-</page><page sequence="12">FRED MURATORI 1 5 3 quiturs, though amusing, may carry few interesting implications: "When I foam at the mouth / a little, I know you're really in the vicinity. . . ." Notice how the small, unserviceable filler words like "a little" and "really" drain energy from the lines. Here I might appear to be criticizing Gerstler for some of the same char- acteristics I find tolerable, even necessary, in Waldrop and Hoover. True enough. Though my postmodern tolerance for ambiguity grants a wide lati- tude, these lines by Gerstler bother me because their complications seem un- productive, unevocative, even damaging to the poem. I suspect the poet of straining, of trying too hard to show off her wares, whereas with Hoover and Waldrop I sense not only improvisation but also discovery as they follow the strange routes taken by their words and obsessions. Gerstler follows her in- stincts as well, but within structures too easily defined, too transparently wrought. Though I won't go so far as to say her poems resemble exercises- they're just too much fun, and I genuinely admire their interplanetary leaps and hairpin turns- they do betray the formulas that begot them, and as a result they demand less afterthought once the immediate experience of reading them ends. In the context of the criteria set out by Eliot and Empson, they don't seem quite so difficult or ambiguous after all. # Oddly, Edward Nobles' deceptively titled Through One Tear just might qualify as the closest thing to conventional mainstream poetry among the quintet of books at hand, though the publisher describes this debut collection as "profoundly surrealistic." Nobles' poetry lies within hailing distance of Gerstler's, evincing a similar attraction to painting, to disfigured narrative, and to inventively introverted personae. In fact, the degree of its introversion, its bell jar hermeticism, is what gives Nobles' surrealism its particular cast. I felt not so much that I was reading the poems as that I was trapped in a room alone with them. They reminded me of one of those films or television dramas in which the murder suspect sits beneath the stark lights of a police interrogation room and reveals his secrets to the shocked but fascinated detective. "The Habit of Perfection: The First of Five" is a typically creepy ex- ample of Nobles' hothouse explorations of the damaged psyche. (The epi- graph at the head of this poem, a line from Gerard Manley Hopkins, reads "find the uncreated light.") I used to look into the eyes to the soul. I felt sympathy and hurt. Then I looked not into but at the eyes, the size of the centers, their blackness, the color of the outer rim, the greens, the blues, the multiple shades of brown,</page><page sequence="13">154 THE GEORGIA REVIEW whether the whites were really white, or bloodshot or yellowed, how the eyes opened and closed, their amazing unconscious automation, the ability to sleep, to stop up the light; my failings. Of what combinations did my own eyes consist as I took the penknife and slit? The mind was my only mirror. But I had the sensations of touch to reflect, the sharpness of pain, the scent of loss, the alluring sound of my shudders and tears. Enraptured, my soul exited my eyes. There were angels in my ears. I felt past the flame to the wax. It was my next goal to free them. One presumes that the angels inhabiting the instruments of the next four "habits"- ears, nose, tongue, hands- will also be liberated/eliminated in a step- by-step process of self-mutilation. Like many of the speakers in Nobles' poems, this one feels compelled to atone, to suffer, to rid himself of unwanted pos- session by spirits, to be erased, to be done with the self, to die. What's more frightening is that his masochistic madness is not seen as an isolated case, but as a symptom of some millennial, apocalyptic condition that permeates all of society: "Each man carries / an axe dug deep inside himself, / with pleasure." Through One Tear bristles dangerously with knives, metal tools, axes, broken glass. Its gloomy landscapes, often obscured by smoke or fog, encom- pass warehouses, industrial sites, doomed and savage forests- all seemingly poised at the brink of a nuclear winter or else haunted by the suggestion of random combat, with soldiers making strategic cameo appearances. The long poem "Loss" could be interpreted as the metaphoric rending of Bosnia retold in a lunatic's docu-dream. References to "the nation collapsing / upon itself in the dying century" or to "The world's swollen dream, atomic / in its weight" seem almost nostalgic- dare I say retro-chic?- in their pessimism. The poet seems determined to sustain the atmosphere of the Cold War, but with a 1990's world- weariness ("I am tired. Dream for me") replacing fear and panic buying at the supermarket. Nobles' enterprise suffers generally from a lack of humor- even a wry, dark humor in sparing doses- that would allow the reader a breath or two before witnessing the next humiliation. Over and over he impresses on us the solemnity of his purpose. "Architectural Digest" is written in the form of Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," and scattered bits from Dante, Pound, John Berryman, and Ted Hughes remind us of the poet's liter- ary seriousness. Nobles does, to be sure, exercise an uncommon control of tone and voice, a navel-gazing absorption that draws us in even when our impulse</page><page sequence="14">FRED MURATORI 1 55 is to look away. We might go so far as to call it lyricism, albeit of a dejected variety, when we encounter stanzas such as the following in "To America's Shore": A priest in the window. A street with granite curbing lying on its side, uprooted and washed ashore. Sidewalks beautifully buckled from heavy frost. Street lamps, their cries of safety stopped, muffled in fog; they drop their knives in scattered pools. Fissures in cool asphalt. Red light falls into puddles, burns on each blade of grass. And in the hunter-green flower boxes lie the tubers. And in the gutter lies the book, its pages buckled from a burst of rain. And the black glistening streets all weave together, with houses, wires, and windows, down toward the sea. These passages- perhaps the brightest in the book- contain something of the skewed senses of beauty Paul Hoover considers in the poem I quoted earlier. We appreciate them as word paintings, hauntingly paced, delicately brushed. They might have come from the pen of Elizabeth Bishop or Robert Lowell; it would be easy to forget that they are loving appreciations of aftermath, of destruction caused by a purgative, natural force. For all the skill and singularity Nobles exhibits this is not a likable book- but then neither are Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal nor Ted Hughes's Crow nor Sylvia Plath's Ariel , all of which made necessary course adjustments in poetry's Carnival cruise toward facile enlightenments and I'm-okay-you're- okay reassurances that others suffer as we do. I sincerely hope that nobody suifers as much as Nobles' speakers, but it can be reassuring to read poems that prove we're not nearly as dysfunctional as we could be. * In choosing to read poetry that we know at the outset to be openly sur- realistic (Gerstler, Nobles), conceptual (Hoover), procedural (Waldrop), or self-contained (all of the above) in an unfamiliar, uncompromising way, we must consciously suspend the kinds of judgments and evaluative tools we might otherwise apply to more "realistic" or representational verse regarding aspects such as consistency of tone, aptness of imagery, deftness of meter, etc. If we read enough of this difficult work over time, we might experience what Empson describes as "conscious theory made habitual and returned to the pre-conscious," or become what Eliot calls "seasoned" readers, those who do "not bother with understanding; not, at least, at first." For better or for worse, we should grant poetry the license to do whatever it does on its own turf, and</page><page sequence="15">I56 THE GEORGIA REVIEW we can develop an intuitive critical apparatus for absorbing the poetry con- current with our reading of it. This is as much an act of faith as one of critical comprehension, and unless it is quite obvious that a given work has been written as an illustrative sidebar to some specific theory (as is the case with some Language poetry), one's faith in the poet and in one's own faculties of discernment are likely to encounter some serious challenges. In her poem "Figures of Speech" Stephanie Strickland writes To describe much more than a simple instance, you must say much less, and finally point, because complexity is its own best- shortest- description. Strickland's True North is one of those books that tempts a critic to simply "point," for perhaps it is its own best description. Difficult as they are, the other four volumes under consideration here can be read enjoyably enough either in New Critical fashion- that is, attentively and openly, without one's requiring detailed knowledge of extraliterary disciplines- or in the light of some general sense of what modernism and its successors were trying to achieve. And certainly most mainstream poetry, if it happens to focus on a famous person or real event (as does William Hey en's recent Crazy Horse in Stillness ) will supply us with sufficient background exposition, no matter if we skipped class the day that subjcct was discussed back in Western Civ 102. True North , however, strives to take us to the edge of both content and tech- nique. Its difficulties are conceptual and procedural, and all the more so for its reliance on worlds of knowledge- including mathematics, physics, and lin- guistics-that rarely infiltrate belles-lettres. Just as Strickland's previous book, The Red Virgin : A Poem of Simone W eil , was dedicated to the life and work of a pioneering woman philosopher, her third evokes the spirit of the nineteenth-century Yale mathematical physi- cist Willard Gibbs, whose research into thermodynamics, vector analysis, and statistical mechanics literally changed the course of science and technology. Perhaps not so coincidentally, the juxtaposition of Gibbs's oddly solitary life- like Emily Dickinson he spent all his life in the same house, never married, rarely traveled- with his important accomplishments also captured the at- tention of another poet, Muriel Rukeyser, who published a biography in 1942. Rukeyser found poets and scientists to be strongly related in that they "have given themselves most closely to the creation and description of systems, speak to the ripeness of their age; live conscious that their own nature is to be translated into the terms of the systems of which they speak." Gibbs was cer- tainly preoccupied with the study of how systems work, and that preoccupa-</page><page sequence="16">FRED MURATORI 1 57 tion resulted in his formulating the law of thermodynamics which more or less states that any given system will tend toward entropy- the consequence of all its energy being expended- until it reaches a state of complete equili- brium. In its own way, Strickland's True North also grapples with systems- natural, ritual, linguistic, spiritual- that underlie and govern human existence, as well as with ideas of transference, change, progress, and settlement, forces that course through her poetry with (if I may borrow a notion from Paul Hoover) the richness of history on its way to becoming myth. I envision the dynamics of her work as a Venn diagram depicting three large intersecting circles labeled GOD, NATURE, and LANGUAGE, with the small, shaded area of overlap designated as HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS. Strickland is not entirely alone in her remote galaxy of the poetic cosmos; poets like Jorie Graham and Joan Retallack also shoulder Big Themes, drawing on specialized vocabularies and encyclopedic arrays of arcane knowledge, but Strickland brings a sense of pursuit to her enterprise, a sharpness that separates it from the languid meditations of Graham and the decorous but often inscrutable word games of Retallack. Perhaps one can best observe Strickland's commingling of spiritual, natural, and linguistic forces in the poem "American Speech": Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. Don't Tread On Me! The Connecticut Valley has to be the most abstract location in the universe- minds of winter, minds of Iceland spar, at work in Dickinson, Edwards, Peirce, and Gibbs. The whole a hotbed of revival, of Great Awakening: the one word Noah Webster invented, of all those in his book, demoralise , a slow seep into melting snow and gray afternoon; Gibby, skating</page><page sequence="17">158 THE GEORGIA REVIEW long strokes on the pond; Emily- watching freedom condense inside the clear glass of her window. In this Valley, neighbors disregard -sustain- hidden fervence, run Underground railroads; Images and Shadows sewn up in Edwards's notebooks, flint stitched into Dickinson's, 700 equations of Gibbs's great paper set up in type at last by shopkeepers' subscription: in CT, they Make Do, but they tore the house, the home 011 High Street, Gibbs's- born and died there- down. The poem's widely spaced, descending triads parallel the appearance of the three major historical characters: Gibbs, who represents the study of physical forces; Emily Dickinson, who embodies the use of language; and Jonathan Edwards, who of course stands in (if rather severely) for God and spiritual aspiration. The poem itself is the conscious manifestation, the iconic recogni- tion, of these three invisible but ever present quantities in human life. The same cold climate and unsparing social conditions conducive to New England practicality also foster the more abstract (if no less ascetic) preoccu- pations of the poet, the metaphysician, and the physicist, all of whom in some fashion unwittingly lay the groundwork for the eventual demoralizing of the universe- not necessarily in the sense of spiritual or moral letdown, but as a lessening of Goďs moralistic presence in the world through the mediation of science and culture. In the short term, of course, necessity wins. No doubt Gibbs's New Haven home, which should have been declared a historical land- mark, was razed for economic reasons that had little to do with the enrich- ment of human knowledge. Laced with references to Archimedes, Copernicus, Wang Wei, Locke, the Amistad rebellion, and Scottish folk tales-the list goes on-Stricklanďs poems exhibit wide-ranging interests which may at times deceive the reader into thinking he or she has stumbled through a wormhole and into a new book by Albert Goldbarth. Her allusiveness, like Goldbarth's, does more than ac-</page><page sequence="18">FRED MURATORI I59 knowledge influences; it forms the very fabric of her art. By synthesizing material from so many areas of knowledge, Strickland gives shape to the primary conflict that fuels her efforts: the struggle between empirical anal- ysis and intuitive apprehension as mechanisms for discerning truth. "Narrow- ness of Narrow Path Endured" appears to be a kind of wrap-up poem, a sum- mation that attempts to knot these opposing strands of comprehension into one unruly bow: Identical in nature, but differing in phase, are we at odds? Can we be contained on a riling, ruthlessly captained, single ship? It swirls like a stick in the whirlpool at the Straits. Can we be controlled by a motherly gaze? By the tottering walk of a mother-to-be who caresses the already-born with eyes and tongue, but self-absorbed in the one-to-come, sways as she walks catching the sun on one shoulder, then another, perambulating mother? Or by him, one of the roughs, melding with the crowd- with them but untouched? Can we be compassed by thought? The "single ship" and "motherly gaze" collapse into thought-that is, a synthe- sizing theory. Can there be a unified theory of humanity when human im- pulses are so contradictory, so divisive? The poet seems to suggest that we had better continue trying to develop one. Strickland packages her intellectually ambitious project with such vigor and originality that it simply can't be ignored, no matter if relatively few readers will rest satisfied in their comprehension of its complexities. As if ex- pecting the kind of puzzlement that greeted Gibbs when his theories were first published, Strickland writes: "The reward for / getting past the failings of language? To be found / un-readable." How fitting, then, that True North is also being offered in a multimedia, hypertext CD-ROM version by Eastgate Systems, since it is a perfect candidate for a medium which dispenses with linearity and spatial constraints. Such a labyrinthine work deserves to exist in an equally labyrinthine environment, one in which all caverns of thought are simultaneously connected. # Our postmodern era, perhaps to its credit, finds almost nothing unreadable, or for that matter unwritable. Though I don't suggest that we should twist our</page><page sequence="19">l6o THE GEORGIA REVIEW brains into Möbius strips in contrived efforts to "make sense" of difficult poetry, nowadays it does seem irresponsible behavior to simply throw up our hands in defeat, as Empson did over Gertrude Stein, if only because we have learned so many times- in art, music, and poetry- how the shock of the new wears off in time. If we have accepted as givens "the failings of language," its ambiguities and difficulties, then a corollary to that acceptance may well be the acknowledgment that the only route past language is through it, as frus- trating a journey as that might be. Empson presciently recognized that Always rich and disheveled, it [the English language] is fast be- coming very rich and disheveled; always without adequate devices for showing the syntax intended, it is fast throwing away the few devices it had; it is growing liable to mean more things, and less willing to stop and exclude the other possible meanings. The five poets discussed here are, as Muriel Rukeyser would agree, sys- tem builders of a particularly determined sort. They choose to ignore Eliot's observation that the poetry with which we are most comfortable is that which reinforces what we already know. In venting their "very rich and disheveled" vocabularies, they recognize the uniquely expressive and explorative oppor- tunities offered by poetry as opposed to prose. To quote Eliot once more, "anything that can be said as well in prose can be said better in prose. And a great deal, in the way of meaning, belongs to prose rather than to poetry." Acclimation over time may be the key to comprehension, and whether these poets make adequate concessions to the "average intelligent reader's" familiar idea of "meaning" may not matter very much, since human beings possess the remarkable ability to fashion systems of response, and to imagine tools com- mensurate with whatever imaginings their poets place before them.</page></plain_text>
