NUMBER 1 NINETY-THIRD YEAR MUCTAZILITE HISTORIOGRAPHY: MAQDISI'S KITAB AL-BAD' WA:L-TA:RiKH TARIF KHALIDI, American University of Beirut I THE historiography of any community is frequently the expression of that community's desire to understand itself and its role in history. But to understand is often to justify, and the need for historical justification has been a constant feature of Muslim historiography from its earliest beginnings in the Koran and Hadith down to modern times. One basic motive for the rise of Muslim historiography was the attempt to relate Islam historically to other nations and creeds, to define the relationship between Islamic and pre-Islamic or non-Islamic history. Another motive was the desire of the various sects of early Islam to gain for their politico-theological views the respectability of his- torical continuity and validity. This latter motive is one which has not received sufficient attention, partly because the earliest views of many of these sects cannot be reconstructed with enough accuracy to allow a particular historical interpretation to be definitely ascribed to a particular sect. In the fourth/tenth century, the problems raised by sectarian historiography become relatively easier to disentangle. By then, most of the major sects of Sunni and ShiCI Islam had evolved their juristic and theological doctrines. Intersectarian movements, like the Muctazila, had been active for almost two centuries. Imami Shicite historiography had produced, in Mastfidi, a formidable defender of the historical validity of Shicism.1 The Muctazila, too, had engaged in historiography and heresiography2 but, thus far, no history written from a definite Muctazilite viewpoint has come to light. This article seeks to establish that al-Maqdisi's Kitib al-Bad' wa'l-Ta'rikh is the earliest and possibly the 1 This is argued at length in my forthcoming study, Islamic Historiography: The Histories of Mascfdi (Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1975). 2 See, e.g., Josef van Ess, ed., Friihe Muctazili- tische Hdresiographie, Zwei Werke des Na5i' al-Akbar (Beirut and Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1971); Fu :d Sayyid, ed., Fadl al-Ictizal wa Tabaqdt al- Muctazila (Tunis: al-Dar al-Tfinisiyya, 1974): an edition of three biographical dictionaries by the Muctazilites Abu'l-Qasim al-Balkhi, al-Q.di cAbd al-Jabbar, and al-Hdkim al-Jushami.

The importance of the work in Muslim historiography and Muslim intellectual history needs to be affirmed and assessed. An attempt is made here to appraise Maqdisi not as a historical source but rather as a historical thinker, and to show how his Muctazilite views influenced his historical outlook and method. II Al-Mutahhar ibn T.hir al-Maqdisi is a historian of the fourth/tenth century of whose life next to nothing is known. The Kitab al-Bad', his only surviving work, has suffered almost the same fate, receiving far less attention than it deserves.3 And yet, solely by reason of its structure, it occupies a unique place in Islamic historiography before Ibn Khaldfin. There is a long philosophical and theological introduction which occupies almost one-sixth of the entire work, in addition to frequent theological and philosophical digressions elsewhere. Several chapters are devoted to the creation, followed by a dis- cussion of the various religions of the earth. Then there is a geographical section which leads into pre-Islamic Arabia and culminates in the Prophet MuIhammad. From this point on, the work assumes a more chronological form and the reigns of the various dynasties are recorded down to the author's own days. The first problem in a book with such an unusual structure is to determine the relation- ship between the theological introduction and the rest of the history. Maqdisi states that this introduction is designed to warn men of true religion against atheists, charlatans, and other evil men who deny human responsibility and give free rein to their passions.4 The nature of the relationship is further clarified in several passages of which the follow- ing is perhaps the most direct: Thus, having collected stories about the beginning (ibtid&amp;d) of creation and then having found it necessary to elucidate the proofs for the necessity of a beginning, and having deter- mined that this could not be proved except by proving a creator prior to his creation whose existence could only be proved once we had clarified the means to arrive at this, we began by citing certain definitions of inquiry (nazar) and argument (jadal); then the necessity for proving an Eternal Being who begins and restores; then the beginning of creation itself.5 Maqdisi's first concern, then, is to uphold the generation (hadath) of the world, for which he employs proofs well known to Muslim theology.6 Stories and opinions which have to do with the nature of the world are judged according to whether they substantiate the generation of the world or not.' Proceeding from the generation of the world, we meet with three theological arguments which have a direct relevance to history and are clearly Muctazilite in character. It would be best to treat each argument separately and to indicate its relevance to Maqdisi's historical outlook. 3 See F. Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrift- tums, vol. 1 (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1967), p. 337; F. Rosen- thal, A History of Muslim Historiography, 2d ed. rev. (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1968), index.

The solution of the Muctazilite Abu'l-QAsim al-Balkhi (d. A.D. 931) and others who adopted this view was that before their creation things (ashyd') were confirmed (muthbat) as nonexistent (ma'cdlm) in God's knowledge but were neither accidents (acrad) nor bodies (ajsam), which characterize them when they come into existence (wujid). In the hands of Maqdisi, this Muctazilite argument is not only defended at length but is also used to support the reality of the events of past ages as in the following passage: A thing is named (yudhkar) before its existence. If a thing is only what is confirmed and existent, this would necessitate that whatever is related concerning the history of the world and of past eras since the world began is false and nonsensical.10 Maqdisi defines the nonexistent as a "thing which is known (mac'lm) and within one's power (maqdiir), nothing else." 11 While the Ash'arites did not, of course, deny the reality of the events of the past, it is significant that Maqdisi chose a Muctazilite argument to arrive at a proof of that reality. More specifically, the doctrine appears to reflect the views of Balkhi and the Baghdad school of Muctazilite theology. The second argument which has a bearing on history and the theory of knowledge is the well-known analogy (qiyds) between the present (shdhid) and the absent (ghd'ib), or, perhaps more accurately, between the visible and the invisible.12 One might begin, for the sake of convenience, with Ash'ari's argument for proving God's attributes as separate entities, as set forth in his Lumac. Ash'ari argues that as one deduces, in the realm of the visible, the existence of knowledge (cilm) from the existence of a knower (calim), so can one, by analogy, prove, in the realm of the invisible, the attribute of knowledge from the fact that God is knowing.13 Maqdisi criticizes this on two counts, although he does not mention Ashcari by name. The analogy cannot be made if one compares a visible body (jism) possessing certain attributes to another invisible and possessed of similar attributes. Rather, one must determine whether such an attribute belongs to its object by necessity (wujib), which is its definition (hadd), or reality (haqiqa). The analogy is valid only if the attribute is necessary.14 8 Ibid. 1: 37. 9 According to Shahrastani, Nihaya, p. 151, the first to introduce this argument was the Muctazilite al-Shahham (d. A.D. 847) although, in fact, he was not. For Ashcarite refutations, see B5qilldni, Tamhid, pars. 24-26; Shahrast5ni, Nihdya, pp. 150 ff.; Baghdadi, Us-1l, pp. 70-71; idem, Farq, pp. 179-180; Juwayni, Shdmil, pp. 124-139.

McCarthy in his translation of Ashcari's Lumac, pars. 32-35 and 81. 13 Ashcari, Lumac, par. 18. There is an interesting discussion of this reasoning by analogy in L. Gardet and M. M. Anawati, Introduction &amp; la thdologie musulmane (Paris: Vrin, 1948), pp. 364-67. For an Ashcarite defence of this argument, see B5qilldni, Tamhid, pars. 17-19; later Ashcarites, however, amended this argument: see Shahrastdni, Nihdya, p. 186; Juwayni, Shdmil, p. 682. 14 Bad:, 1: 132. For an identical Muctazilite argument, see cAbd al-Jabbar, Sharh, p. 204.</page><page sequence="4">4 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES The second criticism is more relevant to our purpose since it reveals an interesting aspect of his historical outlook. The passage in question is as follows: I know of no breed of men or nation who do not admit the existence of an invisible thing (shay: fril-gha:ib) to be different from a visible. Among such is one who.., .argues for the existence of a living and speaking being who cannot die although he has never witnessed a living and speaking being who is not mortal. .... Among them are those who claim that certain regions on earth have a twenty-four hour-long day and regions where the sun sets for six months even though they have not seen them. ... Among them are some who maintain that there are regions where no animals or plants can be found. ... The purpose is to remind you that the statement that nothing can exist which cannot be sensed and that the invisible cannot be different from the visible is impossible and false.15 The full implications of this view will be explained later. Such a view, however, is essential for a historical outlook which seeks to tolerate all types of historical reports and to apply to their verification standards derived not only from simple analogy but also from their nature and their attributes. The third argument is derived from the Muctazilite argument for the duration (baqd') of some accidents (acr&amp;d).16 It was important for them to maintain this view if they wished to sustain their belief that (1) the acts of men are generated (muhdath), and (2) capacity (qudra) precedes the act and is joined in sequence (tatacallaq) by the limitless (ghayr mutandhi). Maqdisi maintained that it was possible (yajfz) for both motions (hawwdith) as well as acts (afcdl) to be limitless. He argued that numbers (acd&amp;d) are always in need of a first from which to begin but it is not necessary (yajib) for them to have a limit just because they had a beginning. He further argued that the existence of what does not cease to move (ld yazdl yataharrak) is possible but not the existence of what has always been moving (lam yazal yataharrak). These arguments, he says explicitly, he considered best explained in a book by Abu'l-Qdsim al-KacbI (Balkhi), and he took them over in their entirety.17 Here again, the full implications of this view would be more profitably discussed later. But his affirmation of causality as opposed to the Ashcarites and the ethical and religious consequences which result from this position can be briefly summed up here. As regards causality, Maqdisi explicitly stated that he accepted the acts of nature (afcdl al-tabd'ic) and their effects (ta'thiratihd) upon what possesses a nature (matbfac), although he admit- ted that God had given this power (quwwa) to nature and could also withdraw it at will. The doctrine of afcdal al-tabd'ic upheld by Maqdisi is again specifically the teaching of Balkhi but was denied by the contemporary Basran school.18 The ethical and religious implications caused Maqdisi to uphold God's justice together with his promise (wacd) of bliss and threat (wacid) of damnation. 15 Bad', 1: 80-81. 16 For recent treatments of this problem, see Gardet and Anawati, Introduction, pp. 62-64; Fakhry, History, pp. 69-71.

Madelung.</page><page sequence="5">MUCTAZILITE HISTORIOGRAPHY 5 These three arguments, clearly Muctazilite in inspiration, may be supplemented by others which do not have a direct bearing on history but which serve to establish the source of Maqdisi theological views. This cluster of arguments may be summarized as follows: (1) Attributes: According to Maqdisi, God has two sorts of attributes: attributes of essence (sifdt al-dhdt) and attributes of act (sifdt al-ficl). Among the first he lists life, knowledge, and ability and defines them as those which cannot be negated of Him and over which He cannot be said to have an ability (qudra). Among the latter, he lists will (irdda), benefaction (rizq), creation (khalq), and mercy (rahma). These can be negated of Him and He can be said to possess an ability over them. This division of the attributes is at least as old as Abu'l-Hudhayl and was developed by others like Abu'l-Qdsim al-Balkhi, whom Maqdisi seems to follow closely in this respect.19 To take the contro- versial attribute of will as an example, we know that for both Ashcari and the Ashcarites this attribute is an attribute of essence, whereas Maqdisi, following the Muctazilites, makes it an attribute of act.20 (2) Definition of knowledge: Maqdisi defines knowledge (cilm) as "the belief that a thing is as it is" (ictiqdd al-shay' cal nmd huwa bihi), and this is confirmed either by the senses or by reason.21 This definition, according to Baghdddi, is given by the Muctazilites al- Kacbi (al-Balkhi) and the two Jubbi'Is and is quite contrary to the definition offered either by Ashcari or by the later Ashcarites.22 The difference involves issues already discussed above, and we need not repeat them here.23 (3) "The Most Advantageous": some Muctazilites, as is well known, argued that since God was just and wise, He can only perform that which is "most advantageous" (al-aslah) for his creatures. Maqdisi followed the Muctazilites in this view.24 (4) Free will: In conformity with Muctazilite teachings, Maqdisi maintains that humans were "given power, ability, and choice" (quwwa, qudra, ikhtiydr) so that their actions might merit reward or punishment. Otherwise, the imposition of obligations (taklif) would be meaningless.25 (5) Legal obligations: it was common Ashcarite teaching that there was no legal obliga- tion which could be said to be binding from the evidence of reason alone.26 The Muctazil- ites disputed this and held that certain legal obligations could be deduced from reason alone, and Maqdisi followed them in this respect also.27 In addition to these arguments, there are several oblique references and some stylistic usage which clearly betray approval of the Muctazilites.28 Taken together with the 19 Cf., e.g., Bad', 1: 95-96 with the views of Balkhi as reported in Maturidi, Tawhid, pp. 49-50 and with the views of the Muctazilites as reported in Ashcari, Maqdldt, 2: 195. On the question of attributes in general, see M. Allard, Le Problhme des attributs divins dans la doctrine d'al-As'ari et des ses premiers grands disciples (Beirut: Dir al-Mashriq, 1965). 20 On irdda among the Ashcarites, see Baghdddi, Usiil, pp. 102-104. 21 Bad:, 1: 18-20. 22 Baghdddi, Usi1, p. 5.

A.D. 840) on a point of eschatology: ibid. 1: 205</page><page sequence="6">6 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES arguments outlined above, they serve to support the conclusion that Maqdisi held to the major tenets of the Muctazilite school. III Approximately one-third of the Kittb al-Bad' is devoted to stories of the creation of the world and to pre-Islamic history: biblical, factual, and legendary. In presenting this material, Maqdisi appends frequent comments designed to help the reader to distinguish the true reports from the false. Much of the material is of a supernatural or miraculous nature. Theology comes to the aid of history by indicating certain criteria of evidence or proof which enable the historian to accept or reject this class of reports. While there is no systematic treatment of these phenomena such as we find in later works of theology, whether Ashcarite or Muctazilite, there are enough reflections on this topic to warrant an examination of their import. We shall begin by analyzing some of the more important of these reflections and then attempt to demonstrate their significance in Maqdisi's work as a whole. Maqdisi supplies an interesting description of the circumstances in which a miracle takes place: A thing may be a miracle (mucjiza) at one time while at another time it is not a miracle. It may be a miracle for one nation but not for another. A thing may in the total of its parts be a miracle but each individual part by itself might not be a miracle. This is what we maintain about the victory of the Prophet at Badr ... and about the Koran.29 To Maqdisi, a miracle is relative to time and circumstances. This in turn raises the question of the laws of nature and the breaking of custom (cada), a vexed problem in Islamic theology which can only be treated in so far as Maqdisi himself informs his reader of his views regarding it. In the passage he devotes to the wonders of the world we find explicit approval of Muhammad ibn Zakariyya al-Razi (d. A.D. 925 or 932) and of his Kitdb al-Khawass [Natural Characteristics].30 Careful examination of the natural characteristics of animals, vegetables, and minerals will, according to Maqdisi, help to provide a "natural" explanation of otherwise inexplicable phenomena. He further argues that natural characteristics (!tabdic) exercise an effect upon that in which they inhere and maintains that God gave them this power, making them the cause of natural effects but withdrawing His power at will.31 Furthermore, God can create in nonliving sub- stances a causal determinant (macnd) by which such substances can be made to pray or obey (an obvious reference to certain miracles of the Prophet).32 Custom, therefore, must be understood in terms of natural characteristics. Thus, some of the supernatural occur- rences in the Old Testament may also be explained either naturally or allegorically. In the story of Jonah, for example, the fact that he remained alive inside the whale is no more astonishing than the living embryo in the womb.33 29 Ibid., 4: 175-76; cf. cAbd al-Jabbar, Mughni, 15: 182-84. For an Ashcarite opinion, cf. B&amp;qilldni, Baydn, par. 14 and passim. 30 Bad:, 4: 92 ff. 31 Ibid., 1: 126. 32 Ibid., 2: 23. 3 A full discussion of this type of miracle as re- ported in Maqdisi may be found in Clement Huart, "La Rationalisme musulmane au IVJme siecle," Revue de l'histoire des religions 50 (1904): 200-213. Huart describes Maqdisi as a "Muslim rationalist" but says nothing about his Muctazilite views.</page><page sequence="7">MUCTAZILITE HISTORIOGRAPHY 7 The next question is when and why does God intervene. It is the Muctazilite teaching, according to Maqdisi, that miracles (mucjizat) and signs (ayat) cannot take place except at the hands of prophets or in their time. This is the general principle to be applied to all Koranic and Old and New Testament prophets. In the story of the Sleepers in the Cave, for example, the explanation for the miracle is either that a prophet was then alive or that one or all the Sleepers were prophets. This is a view to which he himself subscribes. Otherwise, the report must be rejected as false, even though it might otherwise possess a moral (cibra).34 If a miracle is accurately transmitted and no prophet was known to have been alive at the time, the story may have to be interpreted allegorically.35 But allegorical explanations are unwarranted in Koranic miracles such as Noah's flood, where to allegorize would mean to reduce the entire Koran to symbolism, which is precisely what the heretics (zanadiqa) want.36 On the miracles of the Prophet Muhammad, Maqdisi argues as follows. First, these miracles are true if attested in the Koran or if contained in a trustworthy report, whether a parallel exists in nature or not. The miracles recorded in the Koran are within the power of God and must be accepted." The Koran itself is a miracle because of the unmet challenge to imitate it, its language, and the foretelling of events contained in it.38 Second, Maqdisi reports a group of miracles, such as the speech of the wolf who announced the coming of Muhammad and the yearning of the tree for him when he left it and began to preach from the pulpit. This group of miracles, Maqdisi warns us, includes some whose chain of transmission (isndd) is not trustworthy and therefore need not be accepted as true.39 Third, there are reports about the Prophet such as that he cast no shadow, that his private parts were invisible, and that he had no body odor. These do not have a trustworthy isnad and, what is more interesting for our purposes, have no parallel in human nature.40 These reflections have several noteworthy features. To begin with, the agreement expressed with the Muctazilite view that miracles occur only at the hands of prophets or in their time excludes the Ashcarite belief in the charismata (karamat) of holy men (awliyd').41 Such miracles mark the true prophets off from the claimants to prophecy (mutanabbi').42 Furthermore, his reaction to Rizi betrays a common Muctazilite attitude. He takes RAzi to task for rejecting miracles outright but refers his reader to RAzi's work on natural phenomena.43 In addition, his belief that God creates a macnd in inanimate objects by which such objects manifest certain animate attributes may well reflect the influence of Mucammar ibn cAbbad's theory of manca.44 From miracles one might conveniently move to historical reports in general and Islamic eschatology. Here, although his reflections are not set forth as clearly as they 34 Bad&amp;, 3: 129-43. 35 E.g., ibid., p. 146. Cf. the Ashcarite interpretation of these miracles in Bdqilldni, Baydn, pars. 55-56, where such miracles may be attributed to holy men and are then called kardmdt. 36 Bad&amp;, 3: 22-23. The heretics here, according to Huart in "La Rationalisme," are the Ismdcilis. 37 Bad:, 3: 141; 4: 173 ff.; 5: 25 ff. 38 Ibid., 5: 43-44. 39 Ibid., pp. 25 ff. 40 Ibid., p. 3. 41 For a full statement of the Muctazilite position, see cAbd al-Jabbar, Mughni, 15: 226 ff., 241-43. The Ashcarite position is defended in Baghdddi, Usidl, pp. 169 ff. See also Wensinck, The Muslim Creed, pp. 224 ff. 42 Bad&amp;, 4: 43. 43 Ibid., pp. 92 ff. It is well known that certain Muctazilites, especially of the schools of al-Nazzim and Mucammar ibn cAbbad were sometimes referred to as ashdb al-.tabd'ic ("the naturalists"): cf. Ashcari, Maqdldt, 1: 69 and the defence of this in Khayydt, Intisdr, p. 47. 44 See HI. A. Wolfson, "Mucammar's Theory of Macnd," in Arabic and Islamic Studies in Honor of H. A. R. Gibb, ed. G. Makdisi (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1965), pp. 673-88.</page><page sequence="8">8 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES are in the question of miracles, Maqdisi appears more stringent than the average Muslim historian of his period. A good illustration of his attitude to the supernatural occurrences of ancient history would be his retelling of old Persian history, much of which he clearly regards as legendary.45 The Persian kings Kayiimarth and Bayiirasb perform feats of magic which indicate either the presence of a prophet or the fabrication of storytellers (quss.s), against whom he frequently warns his reader. But why record such stories ? Because, according to Maqdisi, they often contain a moral (cibra) worth preserving as an illustration of God's omnipotence.46 Some have parallels with Old Testament stories which Maqdisi points out, without, however, inferring transmission between cultures.47 Some are possible by the nature of things and need not be rejected at all. Some are to be interpreted allegorically.48 Maqdisi's views on eschatology are best understood when they are set against a common Muctazilite attitude to historical reports, especially those with theological or eschatological significance. Some Muctazilites tested the truth of these reports against their own theological teachings. Thus reports which were anthropomorphic in character or tended to uphold determinism (jabr) were rejected as false, while others which sup- ported their tenets were accepted. This scepticism was born of the desire to maintain the integrity of their theological teachings.49 Perhaps the most celebrated instance of this scepticism is Nazzrm's (d. ca. A.D. 845) denial that reports handed down by multiple narration (tawdtur) were necessarily true.50 On eschatology in general,51 some Muctazilites appear to have denied the punishment in the tomb (cadhab al-qabr), and the Egyptian historian MaqrizI (d. A.D. 1442) says that one of the pejorative names for the Muctazilites was al-qabriyya.52 On eschatology the general principle is stated as follows: "The stories (riwayat) of the Muslim community do not necessitate belief if there is no consensus, explicit citation in a revealed book or a report handed down from a truthful prophet who is sustained by overwhelming miracles." 53 The punishment in the tomb by the two angels, Munkar and Nakir, is not mentioned at all by Maqdisi. One might suggest two reasons for this. The first is that there is no reference to Munkar and Nakir in the Koran. The second and perhaps more important reason is that the punishment in the tomb conflicted with the Muctazilite understanding of God's justice. But Maqdisi describes other features of Islamic eschatology like the bridge (sirdt) and the balance (mizdn) which must, according to him, be accepted as handed down in the Hadith with the following provisos. These reports of the afterlife are not the object of rational perception (15 yudrak bi'l-caql) but of intimate awareness (macrifa).54 Knowledge (cilm), a special kind of macrifa, entails comprehension (ih.ta) of the nature and definition (hadd) of a thing, whereas macrifa, a more general term, means 45 Bad3, 3: 138 ff. 46 E.g., ibid., pp. 144 and passim. 47 The Zoroastrians (Maji?s), were, according to Maqdisi, Bad', 3: 142 and 148-49, particularly inter- ested in these parallels. 48 E.g., ibid., pp. 146 and 149. 49 The clearest statement of this view is to be found in cAbd al-Jabbxr, Sharh, pp. 268 and 769, where he argues that reports embodying determinism and anthropomorphism are to be rejected by inference (istidldlan). 50 Baghdddi, Usiil, pp. 11-12. See also Ashcari, Maqdldt, 1: 297 (the Muctazilites on the sins of prophets); BaghdAdi, Farq, pp. 114, 125, 128 (Nazzim on miracles, knowledge of past events, and tawdtur); Ashcari, Maqdldt, 2: 164 ff. (the Muctazilites on eschatology). 51 Ashcari, Maqdldt, 2: 116. Cf. Wensinck, The XMuslim Creed, pp. 117-21, who states, "It is well known.., .that the Muctazilites... rejected much of popular eschatology" (p. 121). 52 Maqrizi, Khitat, 4: 169. See, however, cAbd al- Jabbdr, Sharh, p. 730, who states that the Muctazilites accepted the cadhdb al-qabr. 53 BadD, 2: 7. 54 Ibid. 1: 172; cf. 1: 164 and 197.</page><page sequence="9">MUCTAZILITE HISTORIOGRAPHY 9 perception of the essence (dhat) and existence (thabat) of a thing even though its definition and reality (haqiqa) are not perceived. The monotheists (muwahhidiin), according to Maqdisi, have intimate awareness of God but know Him only by proof (ithbat), since modality (kayfiyya) and quantity (kammiyya) are negated of Him.55 These stories, then, are not the object of rational proof but must be accepted as a corollary of God's essence and existence (i.e., that He is, that He is truthful, etc.). Since these stories are transmitted in the form of a report (khabar) either in the Koran or in a trustworthy manner, they must be accepted without there being any further need for the comprehension of the nature and definition of the reality of the report. In this view, he states that he is in agreement with the views of the Muctazilite Abu'l-Hudhayl.56 The conclusion appears to be that such reports are known by necessity (dariiratan), as God is known by neces- sity.57 The other proviso, according to Maqdisi, is that such reports must not embody any anthropomorphic ideas.58 As for stories about the creation of the world, of which the Hadith preserves a great number, Maqdisi applies similar standards for their verification. Such stories, in other words, must be supported either by consensus or by an explicit text in the Koran or by a report handed down from a truthful prophet.59 Here, as in eschatology, the danger often comes from storytellers who make it possible, by narrating absurdities, for the atheists and others to attack Islam and subvert the minds of unsuspecting Muslims.60 No subject, according to Maqdisi, is more confused and confusing.61 The creation of the world leads Maqdisi to a lengthy discussion of cosmology, astronomy, and the nature of the heavenly bodies in which he states that the explanation of the "ancients" (qudamd') may be held to be possible so long as they do not conflict with God's unity and revealed law and so long as no voluntary action (fiCl ikhtiydri) is imputed to the heavenly bodies.62 It is important for the Muslim to bear constantly in mind that this world was produced in time since this would allow him to give rational explanations for such stories as the tree whose fruit Adam was forbidden to eat and the penetration of man by Satan (the first is to test Adam and the second is compared to the penetration of substances by accidents).63 Popular stories about the creation of the world, such as the story of the whale, the bull, the rock, and the angel who were sent by God to support the earth and are said to be responsible for the winds and tides, cannot be accepted literally. While their creation as such is not impossible to God, these stories are best understood in an alle- gorical fashion.64 On meteorological phenomena in general, the very frequent quotations from Aristotle and other Greek sources to explain such occurrences as thunder, lightning, and earthquakes serve to emphasize the necessity of scientific explanation in areas where divine revelation is not explicit.65 IV It remains to deal in a general manner with certain problems in non-Islamic and Islamic history.

Theology here gives way to chronology, a transition which, in some ways, is comparable to the division in the works of near-contemporary historians such as Yacqilbi and Masc'idi where a broad thematic and cultural treatment gives way to chronological narrative. Some reasons for this change in treatment will be suggested below. On the nations of the earth, Maqdisi writes: The Arabs, Persians, Byzantines, and Indians are, of all nations on earth, the possessors of arts and morals. They possess histories and biographies, the Ayin, wisdom, initiative, reflection, praiseworthy habits and traditional sciences like medicine, astrology, mathematics, calligraphy, geometry, mindreading, fortune-telling, religious and revealed books.... All other nations are barbaric, savage, and low..., either bestial in their lack of discrimination and perspicacity or savagely uncouth and uncivilized ... .66 On Byzantine, Indian, and Chinese history, Maqdisi states that although they must have possessed a history of importance, he finds that the scholars of his own days have not bothered to record it. Consequently, Maqdisi's history is almost exclusively devoted to Arab and Persian affairs. He is especially well informed and detailed on Persia from the Umayyads onwards.67 Non-Islamic history in general serves as a "moral and a guide." 68 Islamic history, on the other hand, receives a more strictly chronological/dynastic treatment for the following reason: the bulk of Islamic history had grown enormously by the fourth/tenth century. By the time of Maqdisi, history had become deeply involved in the theological and legal disputes of the Muslim community.69 History was often the surest guide to the veracity of a legal or theological viewpoint and many of the major sects in Islam diverged from the rest of the community as a result of essentially historical disputes. The Shicites, for example, argued the claims of CAli and his progeny largely in historical contexts like the supposed delegation of authority by the Prophet to CAli at Ghadir Khumm, and it is no accident that many of the most prominent Muslim historians of the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries held pro-Alid views or sentiments. For the Muslim historian, therefore, Muslim history in particular was of immediate relevance to the legal and theological disputes of the community. A chronological or dynastic treat- ment seemed often to be the most exact way of recording events, and it would be in this fashion that the Muslim historian would best serve the needs of his colleagues, the jurists, theologians, and Traditionists.70 Balddhuri's Fut.h al-Bulddn is a good example of his- toriography coming to the aid of jurists and administrators. The portrait Maqdisi draws of the Umayyads is generally unfavorable with the three exceptions of Muc'wiya II, 'Umar II, and Yazid III. The first he calls a "Qadari" and the last, nicknamed the "deficient" (al-ndqis), was deficient only in the sense that he did not pay his troops.7' The Muctazilites, together with certain intellectual circles close to them, took a generally favorable attitude to Yazid because he supposedly was one of them. cUmar II's piety was acknowledged so widely that the verdict on his reign was almost unanimously favorable. On the Shicites, Maqdisi adopted a viewpoint common to 66 Ibid., 1: 57-58, cf. similar opinions in near- contemporary authors like Yacqfibi, Mascfidi, and Abfi .Hayydn al-Tawhidi, esp. the latter's al-Imtdc wa:l- .Mu:dnasa. 67 See e.g., Bado, 6: 33, 51, and 100, where Persian sources are cited. 68 Cf. n. 34 above. 69 See his verdict, e.g., on Shicite ceremonies commemorating the death of Husayn in Bad:, 6: 13. 70 This is particularly obvious and explicit in Maqdisi's account of the Prophet and his reasons for dealing with it: see ibid., p. 209. 71 See ibid., pp. 16-17, and 53.</page><page sequence="11">MUCTAZILITE HISTORIOGRAPHY 11 other Muslim historians. He was, in general, sympathetic to Alid claims but strongly disapproved of Shicite excesses, such as the ceremonies that grew up surrounding the death of Husayn ibn cAli. But the Abbasids fare no better at Maqdisi's hands. There is a highly critical portrait of al-Mansiir which is as negative as anything he wrote on the Umayyads.72 The caliphs of his own days are dealt with very briefly, and it is stated that the affairs of the caliphate declined in the reign of one of them, al-Muqtadir.73 CONCLUSION In the fourth/tenth century, Islamic historiography had already developed along lines which differed markedly, in style and content, from Hadith-oriented historical writing. The isnad had been dropped and a continuous narrative had emerged in the writings of certain third/ninth century historians like Balidhuri, Dinawari, and Yacqilbi. These historians also begin to manifest a greater interest in the non-Muslim world and in themes which one might broadly term cultural history and achievements. When the Muctazilite school began to assert itself in the early third/ninth century, its influence was felt far beyond the field of theological polemics. For one thing, these polemics made for a more exact prose and an economy of diction which left its mark on poetry and belles-lettres (adab). For another, the discussion of certain topics, chiefly God's relationship to the created world, raised further problems which demanded scientific or quasi-scientific answers. Issues like the act of creation itself, substance and accidents, the nature of the physical world, and the vexed problem of "possibility" (tajwiz)74 were often discussed as though they were problems in physics rather than metaphysics. The encyclopedic output of J.hiz or, for that matter, of Masciidi, is inconceivable without this background of wide-ranging Muctazilite curiosity. If, as seems almost certain, we ought to identify Maqdisi with the Muctazilites, more particularly with the circle of Abu'l-Qasim al-Balkhi, much of what might otherwise appear puzzling in his Kitab al-Bad' becomes easier to understand. That aspect of religion which presented itself to the people most vividly was the quasi-legendary gloss on stories derived from the Koran and Hadith. From a Muctazilite viewpoint in particular, it was here that destructive allegorization on the one hand and insidious attacks on the other would be most effectively felt, turning away the minds of the pious and simple into the path of heresy. Theological rigor is needed to protect the "folk" religion and, in order to do so completely, history, revealed and secular, must be rewritten with the emphasis throughout on the maintenance of the logical consistency of certain theological principles.
