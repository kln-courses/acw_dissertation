<plain_text><page sequence="1">FLEAT II Foreign Language Education and Technology Second International Conference Nagoya, Japan • August 4-7, 1992 A Report by: Willard Ticknor Daetsch, Ithaca College FLEAT 2 was sponsored by the International Association of Learning Laboratories (IJSA) and the Learning Laboratory Association (Japan) and took place at Chubu University. The exquisite planning for the conference resulted in a smooth operation and there were apparently very few hitches in the schedule. Chubu University is located on a hillside well outside the city of Nagoya. The hour-long train and bus trip gave us a chance to see more of the area and to talk. Facilities were excellent and although we were in the area during a particularly hot and humid time most of the rooms were well air-conditioned. There were many opportu nities for informal meetings and most of us, Japanese and Americans, came away from the conference with stacks of calling cards and many friendly contacts which we shall no doubt maintain. Throughout the conference there was a heavy emphasis on new technol ogy for the learning lab and new uses for older technology. Both overtly and covertly there was a strong message that the role of a lab director has changed and is changing dramatically. Materials (commercial and faculty produced), methodology, pedagogical and philosophical concerns were all addressed. From the statements of the presidents of the two organizations: Yosbinobu Niwa, President of LLA "A key issue for all of us is the introduction of technology. It is generally thought that Japan has made many advances in technology and should be proud of this. On the actual educational fronts ofEFL, however, this is far from the truth. Howmany can control videotapes with their own personal computers? How many can use multimedia technology in presentations? I assure you that the multimedia equipment to be used by American presenters for this conference is far advanced, Volume 10 Number 2 69</page><page sequence="2">FLEAT II: Second International Conference and the handling of equipment requests was the most difficult problem for the planning committee. We hope we can expedite the introduction of new technology in language learning application as a direct result of FLEAT II. Finally I xvould like to emphasize onepoint: we should become masters of technology rather than being enslaved by it. We need to establish our own teaching goals, and then make use of technology to attain these goals. To my mind, this is the crux of our discussions and exchanges at FLEAT II. On the basis of our experiences at this conference, and through the continued close interaction between LLA and I ALL in the years to come, I am confident we will be able to more fully integrate the goals of language teaching and technological innovation." LeeAnne Stone, President of IALL "Foreign language education and technology - why are these two areas so closely interwoven? Oneobvious reason is that technology now permeates the fabric of our daily existence. Ifhoivever, there's a more telling reason, and that lies in the fact that the goal of foreign language education and the end results of technology (e-mail, teleconferencing, distance education for example) are one and the same — that is, to bring people together. Thus technology is a natural tool in support of foreign language education. Bringing people together is what FLEAT II is all about as well;... As you review your program, you will see that this conference brings people together from across national borders and across disciplines to share the best of what each has to offer... One of the strengths of this FLEAT conference is its truly international character... At the beginning of the FLEAT planning process, IALL past president Ruth Trometer and I told Professor Niwa that we ivould consider an IALL contingent of 20 to be a successful turnout... Forty IALL members are presenting, and non presenting members are also here. [Over 50 came from the USA and several other countries xvere also represented.]... The high caliber of [the] proposals made the selection process quite difficult-[twice as many as we had slots to fill]. What you see in the FLEAT program, then, really is the 'cream of the crop.'" Three keynote speakers: Prospects for Foreign Language Education - Soiehi Iijima, Senior states man in Japanese education, President of Hiroshima University from 1969 to 1977. Dean of Nagoya University Medical School in 1990. President of Nagoya University from 1981 to 1987. Tuesday, August 4 at the Nagoya International Center. 70 The CALICO Journal</page><page sequence="3">WiLLARD TiCKNOR DaETSCH "Because of the historical connection between Chinese and Japanese with educated Japanese being able to read Chinese without being able to speak the language, it became the custom to separate reading from speaking in the learning of foreign languages. This practice continued with the introduction of Dutch during the Edo period and continued on into the Meiji period and even into instruction today. "In recent decades, personal communication and cultural exchanges among different nations have become increasingly important, and revolutionary changes in language teaching technology and methodology are keenly needed. " Can Technology Fulfill its Purpose? - Gerard L. Ervin, Associate Professor of Slavic Languages at The Ohio State University, Columbus. President of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL). Author of Speak and Read Essential Russian. Associate Editor of the Modern Language Journal. Wednesday, August 5 at Chubu University. "What is the promise of technology for foreign and second language education? The simple answer is that no one really knows. Nevertheless, science-fiction writers have long envisioned a day when tiny, but powerful computers presumably combining artificial intelligence with sophisticated voice recognition and synthesis capabilities will do all our translating and interpreting for us; Already, several versions of the linguistic counterpart to the pocket calculator have reached the market; but most are little more than novelties. It will likely be many years before such devices advance to the level of being valuable linguistic tools. Meanwhile, foreign language educators are concerned with making the most of the obvious potential of technology to help students learn foreign languages. A number of concerns should guide us, such as: 1 ) Are we asking the right questions about technology? 2) Are ive making the right demands on technology? 3) Are we prepared to interact effectively with technology?" New Technologies, New Methodologies - Scott Windeatt, Lecturer and Director of the MA in Media Technology for TEFL at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K. He has directed study skills and teacher training courses and/or taught in Romania, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the U.S.A., Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Qatar, Kuwait and the U.A.E. Co author of a series of workbooks on communicative grammar and of CALL -A Resource Book for Teachers on Computer-assisted Language Learning. Friday, August 7 at Chubu University. Volume 10 Number 2 71</page><page sequence="4">FLEAT II: Second International Conference "...the inevitable introduction of computers into the language classroom will have afar more significant effect on methodology than has been the case with other 'new' technologies. ... the teaching and learning techniques used when audio technology was introduced in the form of language laboratories were predominantly those of the audiolingual method. Video, on the other hand, is more closely associated with the 'communicative' approach. It would clearly be a mistake to suggest that any particular technology can only be used with one particular methodology... however... the computer is different from other technologies. " I have attempted to extrapolate from the conference program something from every presentation so that my report can be a type of reference tool for those who attended (and others). Except for the excerpts from the presidents' addresses and the keynote addresses, given above and the showcases at the end of this report, I have ordered the selections according to my estimation of what the main theme was. I have given numbers to the presentations so that there can be a cross-reference to presentations which contained significant material in several of the categories I have listed. The showcases were, to large extent, in-depth demonstrations of what was also shown in a formal presentation. I cannot be sure that all presentations were made. I have left out only one which I know was not made. I may have omitted someone or something by oversight, and for that I apologize. Some presenters will no doubt wonder at my categories. Putting this report together was solely my endeavor so I take full responsibility for any errors. Many presenters will have their papers published in the proceedings of FLEAT 2.
