<plain_text><page sequence="1">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII THE ORIGINS OF BEN SIRA IN SYRIAC (PART I) It has long been recognised that the Syriac version of Ben Sira differs considerably from the Hebrew text and the Greek and Latin versions. The quantitative differences are quite easy to delineate 1). It has been pre- served in Greek in 1616 lines. To this basic (G I) text the Syriac adds 74 lines but omits 1931. In relation to the Hebrew text, where it exists for the purposes of comparison, the Syriac adds 40? lines and omits 169?. The relationship with the secondary Greek text (G II) is complicated. A small amount of it survives in the Hebrew text, part of which is in the Syriac, namely iii 25 (one line), xi 15, 16 (two lines), xvi 15, 16 (two lines), xxx 12d (half a line), and xxx 20c (half a line). Where the Syriac and sec- ondary Greek are both present for comparison the situation is as follows: the Syriac contains 19 lines of this special G II material, and omits 47 of them. Strangely it adds one line of its own xxvi 26. Finally, one must take account of a significant factor though its import is negative, namely the existence of a large number of lines originating from the G II material though preserved today only in Latin. These comprise 43- lines (plus a couple of words in i 9a) but none of it is found in the Syriac. Qualitatively the problem is more difficult, since the Syriac version frequently offers a different wording (and meaning) in those parts of the book which are preserved in common with the Hebrew or Greek. It is easy to dismiss these discrepancies as careless paraphrase or free translation by a Syrian writer who did not understand the meaning of the Hebrew adequately. Most probably some of the discrepancies are to be accounted for in this way, but recent research indicates that more deliberate influences were at work to produce a substantial number of these divergences. Before my own theory about the Syriac translation is elaborated, it is useful to consider briefly Riiger's investigations of the Hebrew text (Riiger, pp. 112, 113). By a detailed comparison of the re-duplications (and triplications) as well as the parts where two or more manuscripts reproduce the same passage, he has come to the conclusion that there were originally two forms of the Hebrew text. The subsequent process 1) I have used: I. Levi, The Hebrew Text of the Book of Ecclesiasticus (Leiden, 1903); I. Marcus, The Newly Discovered Original of Ben Sira (Ecclesiasticus XXXII 16-XXXIV 1) (Philadelphia, 1931); A. A. Di Lella, "The Recently Identified Leaves of Sirach in Hebrew", Biblica 45 (1964), pp. 153-167; Y. Yadin, The Ben Sira Scrollfrom Masada (Jerusalem, 1965); J. A. Sanders, The Psalms Scroll of Qumran Cave 11 (Oxford, 1965); J. Ziegler, Sapientia Iesu Filii Sirach (G6ttingen, 1965); P. de Lagarde, Libri Apocryphi Veteris Testamenti Syriace (Leipzig, 1861). For detailed studies I have relied on: H. P. Ruger, Text und Textform im He- brdischen Sirach (Berlin, 1970); R. Smend, Die Weisheit des Jesus Ben Sirach (Berlin, 1906). Vetus Testamentum, Vol. XXVII, Fasc. 2</page><page sequence="2">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII of copying manuscripts brought about a partial (and confused) amal- gamation of the two text forms. In a number of places it is clear that the primitive translations were made before the amalgamation took place, and it is possible to see that, for instance, the Syriac has translated (faith- fully) one Hebrew form, and the Greek has followed the other. For example iv 30a is preserved in two Hebrew manuscripts A and C. Manuscript A reads: "Do not be like a dog (kklb) in thy house", and it is followed literally by the Syriac: I' thw' klb bbytk Whereas manuscript C reads: "Do not be like a lion (k'ry') in thy house". The Greek translation follows this form faithfully, retaining the all im- portant word X&amp;cv. Riiger supplies many similar examples throughout his book, and the phenomenon accounts for a considerable number of divergences between the Hebrew and the Greek. In view of the fewness of the Hebrew manu- scripts, and the small areas where they overlap, one can presume safely that this process may well account for many differences between the Syriac and the surviving Hebrew text, conserved as it is for the most part in only one manuscript at any given point. If further Hebrew manuscripts come to light we may expect further clarifications on these lines. Meanwhile there is another way of accounting for a considerable number of the peculiarities of the Syriac version, without recourse to paraphrase or bad translation, and this is the deliberate al- teration of the text in the act of translating it, in order to suit the theolog- ical preferences of the translator. Although the process seems strange to modern translators of the Bible, the ancients did not regard it thus. Such an attitude was basically the outlook of the makers of the Targumim, since these Aramaic translations are undeniably interpretative versions of the primitive Hebrew text. Similarly, in his translation of the Book of Tobit St. Jerome inserted phrases derived from his own theology of mar- riage. For the sake of clarity I will state my hypothesis before presenting the evidence. There is a group of peculiarities of the Syriac version, too numerous and too consistent to be dismissed as the products of chance, all of which conform to the distinctive marks of Ebionite theology. I will examine them thematically beginning with those passages which seem to have been altered so as to omit any reference to sacrifices. The most striking instance of this category is the re-writing of the first part of chapter xxxii (xxxv). The differences speak for themselves when the different languages are read in parallel columns. Initially the Hebrew is absent. 238</page><page sequence="3">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII SEPTUAGINT (with verse numbers as in Ziegler). 1) He who keeps the Law multiplies offerings (7Tpo(popa.q). 2) He offers (OuaLdatov) a saving offering (acoTIplou) who stands by the commandments. 3) He who returns a kindness offers (7rpoaqc?pcv) fine flour (a?E(8aXLv). 4) He who gives alms makes a sacrifice (0uocaLcov) of praise (oaviaeroq). 5) It is the will of the Lord to keep away from wickedness, and an atone- ment (Xtaoc6aoLS) to keep away from injustice. 6) Do not appear before the face (Ev rpoacorc() of the Lord empty handed. 7) For all these things (i.e. sacrifices) are due under the commandment ('T0ohoxJ;). 8) The offering (Tcpoacpop&amp;) of a just man anoints the altar (0uactoca'pLov), and its sweet smell is before the Most High. 9) The sacrifice (0uaia) of a just man is acceptable, and the memory of it will not be forgotten. 10) In a good eye glorify the Lord, and do not diminish the first fruits (&amp;a0ocpXv) of thy hands.

THIS VERSE IS PLACED ABOVE, BEFORE VERSE 10. FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS TEXTS IN THE THREE LANGUAGES AGREE. Before making an estimate of the value of this passage as evidence, we have to ask whether the Hebrew which lay before the Syriac translator was the same as that from which the Greek was made. Although we cannot be absolutely certain, there is little doubt about the substantial identity on account of the close resemblances which we see after verse 11, and the similarity of phrasing which is still apparent between the Greek and Syriac in the earlier part. The desire to avoid all mention of sacrifice is clear. Close examination of the Syriac reveals three more significant pointers. Verse 2 introduces an uncalled for mention of the Law, verse 4 has avoided an anthropom- orphism, and verse 9b is so clearly reminiscent of Luke vi 34, 35 that one can hardly avoid ascribing it to the pen of a Christian of some shade or other (Smend, p. 312). The clear alterations in that long passage provide the clue to under- standing others which are less obvious. They are as follows: vii 31 The Hebrew (followed closely by the Greek) can be read: "Glorify the Lord and honour the priest, And give their portion as it is commanded, The first fruits, guilt offering, and gift of shoulders, Sacrifices of justice and offerings of holiness" ([b.hy] .dq wtrwmwt qds). The Syriac version follows the first three lines of the verse faithfully reproducing the Hebrew, but omits the fourth. Possibly the last line was considered to be too flattering to the notion of sacrifice. This selectivity is inconsistent, but unlike the third line it seems to imply a value judgement and pronounces upon their holiness. 240</page><page sequence="5">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII xiv 11 The meaning of this verse is best appreciated by starting with the Greek which has conserved an uncomplicated wording, thus: "My son according to what thou hast do well for thyself, And offer sacrifices (7rppoopoq) to the Lord worthily". In the light of this, we can see clearly that the Hebrew, as we have it now, has incorporated a reduplication (Levi, p. 22, note a), without however obscuring the basic meaning: bny 'mjy Ik srwt npsk w'm j Ik hy.tyb Ik wl'lydk hdsn The Syriac is different in its own way, omitting the reference to sacrifice: 'n ryt Ik bry sms npsk w'n Iyt Ik 't'b Ik Since the Syriac has conserved the reduplication, it is reasonable to suppose that the translator had before him a text very like that conserved in manu- script A. This makes the alteration all the more obvious, and it would seem to have been a deliberate suppression of the allusion to sacrifice. xxxviii 11 The Hebrew states quite simply: "Offer a peace offering and a memorial offering, And pour oil on thy offerings according to thy means". The manuscript source B margin offers inconsequential variants. The Greek is slightly different, but the theme of sacrifice is the same. The Syriac omits the verse altogether, though the preceding and following verses are the same as the Hebrew. The omission would seem to be the deliberate work of a translator who was hostile to the very notion of sacrifice. xlv 21 The Hebrew text has been preserved only imperfectly, but sufficient of it survives to show that it was basically the same as the Greek, whose wording is thus: "For he shall eat the sacrifices (Ouoiac) of the Lord, Which he gave to him and his seed". Sufficient of the Hebrew has survived to make it clear that it was sub- stantially the same as that which lies behind the Greek. In one word it is more specific, as the sacrifices are shown to be "burnt offerings" ('v) reminiscent of Deut. xviii 1. The Syriac preserves verses 20 and 22 although they mention sacrifices, but it omits the whole of verse 21. This editorial work shows a lack of consistency, which was not uncommon among the ancients. The omission of verse 21 could have been motivated by the reference to eating sacrifices. As the Ebionites were vegetarians this would have been particularly offensive to them. 1 19-22 In this section, which is virtually the same in Hebrew and Greek, the Syriac omits five lines out of the seven, leaving a short des- cription which is sufficiently close to the parent text to indicate that the x6 241</page><page sequence="6">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII translator had before him the same text form as we read in manuscript B. It can be read thus: 19) "And all the people of the land cried out, In prayer before the merciful one, Until the completion of the service of the altar (mbbh) And his legal sacrifices (mSptyw) were brought to him. 20) Then he came down and lifted up his hands, On the whole assembly of Israel, And the blessing of Yahweh was on his lips, And in the name of Yahweh it was perfected. 21) And they bowed down a second time, (HEBREW DEFECTIVE, GREEK READS:) To receive the blessing of the Most High. (HEBREW RESUMES:) 22) Now bless Yahweh the God of Israel, The wonder-worker who operates on earth, Who exalts man from the womb, And does with him according to His will". In place of this long passage the Syriac has preserved merely two complete lines which are recognisably derived from the Hebrew: 19a) "The people of the land glorified God, 22b) Who does wonders on earth, 22c) Who makes the sons of man from the womb of their mothers, 22d) And who leads them according to His will". The lines which were omitted contained several ideas which were offensive to Ebionite sentiment. The most obvious was sacrifice, and coupled with it was the implication of the importance of the priests and their blessing. That passage leads conveniently to the consideration of the next theme which occurs in the readings peculiar to the Syriac, and which was also distinctive of the Ebionites, namely hostility to the priesthood. In the section known as the Laus Patrum so much space is devoted to the saintly priests like Aaron that it could not all be omitted without a major muti- lation of the book. It seems that the Syrian translator retained the main sequence of ideas and toned down some of the most adulatory references to the priests where it could be done without destroying the fundamental sequence of the narrative. xlv 7 The Hebrew speaks of Aaron in these words: wylymh 1hq 'wlm wytn 'Jyw hwd (Bm: Iw hwdw) wylrth bkbwdw (Bm: bbrkh) The Septuagint has inconsequential variants, but it clarifies what was implicit in the Hebrew by naming priesthood explicitly, in line (b): xaL ?3O6XEV OCUT( lEpt?LCiaV AoCOU 242</page><page sequence="7">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII The Syriac reproduces it in such a way as to omit reference to the eternal decree and the priesthood: "And he set him as a surety of the people, And gave him of his honour and glory, And strengthened him in the height of his honour". The differences between the Hebrew manuscripts and the Greek make it difficult to say exactly what Hebrew text form lay before the Syrian trans- lator. However since he seems to have removed the key phrases related to Aaron's priesthood, it would appear to have been a deliberate alteration. xlv 9-14 This is a passage which describes the liturgical vestments of Aaron, ending with the words: "His sacrifices were consumed entirely Twice, every day, constantly". The Syriac omits the passage altogether, having a gap from the end of verse 8 to the start of verse 15. The importance which the Hebrew text attaches to these vestments, together with the mention of sacrifice at the end, could account for the omission of the whole section by a trans- lator who was sensitive about both notions. xlv 15 e and f The context is the same, namely Aaron's role, and the Syriac has a slight alteration, consistent with the other differences noted above. The Hebrew reads: "To serve Him and do Him priestly service (wlkhn lw) And to bless His people in His name". The Greek follows it closely, and is if anything just a little more emphatic about priesthood since the two words in the first line are Xet-roupyiLv and LepOcTsusLv. By contrast, the Syriac has reduced it to: "To do him service and to bless His people in His name" (ImJmlw wlmbrkw l'mnh bJmw). The absence of an indication about specifically priestly service is signif- icant particularly in view of other alterations of the same kind. 1 24 For this passage the Greek and Syriac differ from each other, and from the Hebrew, which reads: "May he establish with Simon his mercy, And may he set up for him the covenant of Phineas, Which will not be taken away from him and his seed, According to the days of heaven". The Greek is much briefer, and can be translated thus: "May he entrust to us his mercy, And deliver us in our days". 243</page><page sequence="8">PESHIT'A INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII This alteration has been accounted for, convincingly, by Smend (p. 490) who pointed out that by the time that the author's grandson made the Greek translation the priestly family of Simon had been supplanted. The alteration must have been made to spare the readers a particularly cruel irony. The Syriac is different in yet another way: "May He establish with Simon his mercy, And with his seed according to the days of heaven". The retention of Simon's name, and the mention of his descendants makes it clear that the Syrian writer did not have the same motives for change which influenced the Greek translator. Enough has been retained to show that he worked from a Hebrew text very close to that which has survived. The omission of the reference to the covenant of Phineas is explicable on the grounds of hostility to the priesthood, since according to Num. xxv 13 he had been promised a covenant of perpetual priesthood. Other alterations in the Syriac version do not follow a logical pattern and one must select them almost at random. xix 1 The Hebrew has small lacunae, which do not obscure its meaning, which can be rendered thus: "He who does this will not get rich, And he who despises small things will be impoverished". Both the Greek and Syriac presuppose a reading pw'l sth rather than pwcl g't in the parent text, apart from which the Septuagint follows the Hebrew faithfully. The Syriac however indicates further divergence: "The drunken worker will not get rich, And he who lives on flesh (bsr') will inherit poverty". Admittedly, meat was the diet of wealthy people in the ancient near east, but the alteration makes better sense if one assumes that it was made by a translator who had a theological preference for vegetarianism. Hostility to the monarchy seems to explain the next alteration. xliv 3 At this point the Hebrew has survived in three manuscripts, B, its margin Bm, and also the Masada fragment (M). The variants in the margin do not materially affect the argument, and B can be translated thus: a) "Generations on earth in their kingship, b) Men of reputation in their great deeds, c) And counsellors in their discerment, d) And all seeing in their prophecy." The Masada fragment is badly mutilated at this point, but it is clear that it is reproducing the line (c) (d): wywv'sym btbwntm r h why kl bnb --- 244</page><page sequence="9">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII In spite of the mutilated state of the manuscript it is clear from the photo- graphs reproduced by Yadin (plate 8, after p. 49), that there is no space for the line (a) (b), and consequently its text followed directly from verse 2 as it is conserved in all the witnesses. The Greek follows closely on the two line text form as in B, and contains the all important word Pa[0CXeatoc. The Syriac has merely a half line: "And they demonstrated in their prophecy". Did the Syrian writer have before him a two-line Hebrew verse as in B, or a single-line verse as in M? Clearly the Syriac has omitted part (c), which gives rise to the possibility of other alterations as well. Although the argumentation does not rise above the level of possibility, the attitude of hostility to the monarchy, such as the Ebionites had, could explain such an alteration, since the half lines (a), (b), and (c) are flattering to the memory of the kings. A further theme which differentiates the Syriac from the Hebrew is the attitude towards poverty. In almost a dozen places the Syriac seems to have altered the parent Hebrew so as to stress the moral goodness of poverty. I will present them in the order in which they occur in the book: xi 14 The Hebrew and Greek are almost identical, thus: "Good and evil, life and death, Poverty and wealth are from Yahweh". The Syriac follows the Hebrew faithfully for the first line, but renders the second as: "The rich man and the poor man are equal before God". This has all the signs of a deliberate alteration, whose motivation would seem to be a high regard for the state of poverty. xi 18, 19 The context is about a rich man, and the Greek is almost the same as the Hebrew which states: 18) "There is one who is rich through diligence (Gk: and self denial) And this is his reward, 19) When he says 'I have found rest, And now I shall eat of my goods"'. The Syriac is the same as the Hebrew in verse 19, but in 18 it reads: "There is one who is rich through his poverty, And there is one whose riches do not accompany him". A preference for poverty can account for this alteration. xiii 20 The Hebrew is followed closely by the Greek and reads: "An abomination to the proud is humility, And an abomination to a rich man is a poor man". 245</page><page sequence="10">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII The verse is omitted altogether from the Syriac, which could well have been motivated by a reluctance to write anything so uncomplimentary to the poor. xxix 28 The immediate context is a description of the homeless stranger and the humiliations which he must suffer. At this point the Hebrew text has not survived. The Greek and Syriac are the same up to verse 28, but after that verse the Syriac has six half-lines which are not to be found in the Greek, namely: "Indeed, indeed give to the poor, And from what is in thy hand feed him, And if he is naked clothe him, Because thine own flesh dost thou cover, And to God dost thou lend, And he will repay thee sevenfold". Smend (p. 263) considered that these lines had originally stood in the Hebrew because of the likeness to Isa. lviii 7. Personally, I do not consider that it is a conclusive argument. If they had been in the Hebrew, it would be hard to account for their deletion from the Greek. On the other hand, the immediate context might well have prompted the addition from the pen of one who felt strongly about the moral goodness of poverty. xxxv (xxxii) 1 The passage tells how the president of a banquet should act. The Hebrew is illegible for the first half-line, but the Greek is complete, and reads thus: a) "They have made thee president? Do not be haughty, b) Be among them as one of them, c) Be solicitous for them and then sit down". It is clear from Hebrew manuscript B that it did originally contain a line which is in the position of the Greek line (a), but it is now illegible. The Syriac preserves all that is present in the Greek, but adds some words of its own between lines (a) and (b): a) "They have made thee chief? Do not be exalted". "And do not sit down at the head of rich men" (wbryf 'cyr)' 1 tstmk). It is conceivable that the obliterated Hebrew contained these words, but in that case it is hard to understand why the Greek should have dropped them. It is more probable that they are a simple addition by the Syrian writer for whom hostility to wealth was an important motive. xxxvii 4 For this passage two Hebrew manuscripts are extant and B is supplemented by marginal readings which offer only inconsequential variants. (The Greek is substantially the same.) The text reads: "The heart of man makes clear his ways, More than seven watchmen on a watchtower". 246</page><page sequence="11">PESIIITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII The Syriac follows it for the first half-line, but then diverges notably: "The heart of the son of man makes glad his ways, More than the wealth of the world which does not remain" (ytyr mn 'ctr' dclm' dl' mhn'). A deliberate alteration is unmistakable, and its motive is clearly a preference for poverty rather than wealth. xxxviii 21 In a section which discourages pointless sorrow for the dead the Syriac has introduced a striking modification. The Hebrew (which is followed reasonably closely by the Greek) reads thus: "Do not remember him because there is no hope for him, What does it profit him, and to you it causes pain". Corresponding to this the Syriac presents a much longer version: "Do not stumble on wealth because there is no hope in it, Because like the bird of heaven which rises and falls, Thus it is with wealth for the sons of men, It gladdens thee and harms another". 1' ttkl c/ cwtr) mtl dlyt bh sbr' mtwl dyk prht' dnmy' dprh wlkn' hkn' hvw 'wtr qdm bny 'n' Ik mnhd wvlhrn' mb' The pessimistic thought that there was no hope for the dead would motivate a Christian to alter it. The notions of profit and pain have been retained, and they have been reworked ingeniously into strictures against wealth. It could well have been made by a translator who felt strongly about poverty. xl 8, 9 This passage lists the hardships of life, and the Syriac presents a different wording, for which the only motivation would seem to have been a hostility to wealth. The text is poorly preserved in the Hebrew where verse 8 is illegible. Greek conserves both verses and is substantially the same as the Hebrew in verse 9. 8) (from Greek) "For all creatures, man and beast, And seven times over for the sinners, 9) (from Hebrew) Pestilence and blood, strife and desolation, Violence, destruction, evil, and death". But the Syriac renders it thus (after omitting verse 8): "All sons of flesh have their shroud with them, And wealth makes unstable their years". Whether the Syrian translator was unable to read a mutilated Hebrew, or whether he disliked what he saw, is immaterial. The sentence which he wrote shows clearly a bias against wealth. 247</page><page sequence="12">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII xl 28 The Greek and Hebrew have only minor differences between them, and they both speak ill of the life of a beggar. We are dependent on Bm for the obvious correction "my son" bny instead of mny as in B. Thus emended the text reads: "My son, do not lead a beggar's life, Better to be dead than importunate". However the Syriac, while keeping the theme of begging, changes it so as to remove any suggestion that the poor man is despicable: "My son, whoever asks from thee, do not deny him. And do not be good for killing, but be good for conferring life". The alteration is easily explained on the assumption that the translator had a marked preference for poverty. xliv 6 In the introduction to the Laus Patrum, the heroes of Israel are described thus: "Men of wealth ('nsy hyl) and secure in strength, Living at ease in their dwelling places". The two Hebrew manuscripts B and M have insignificant differences, and both of them have the key word byl. Much hinges upon the trans- lation of this word. In his edition of the Masada fragment Y. Yadin (p. 49) has translated it as "resource". The dictionary of Brown, Driver, and Briggs, offers four meanings of which one is "wealth", of which there are some twenty examples in the Old Testament2.) Evidently the Greek translator took it in this sense for the Septuagint renders it as rXouaiot. It would seem likely that the Syrian writer understood it in this way too, since he omitted it, rendering the verse in this fashion: "In gatherings of strength And at peace in their work". The omission is pointless unless one assumes that he took hyl to mean "wealth", and had a strong bias against the notion. xlix 12 In describing the work of Jesus son of Josedech there is a reference to the rebuilding of the temple, in which the Syriac version makes a small insertion which is apparently superfluous. The wording is conserved best in the Greek which states: "Similarly Jesus son of Josedech, Who in their days built the house". The Hebrew is defective and has been reconstructed conjecturally by Levi thus: ['sr bymyhm hkynw mzbhb] 2) F. Brown, S. R. Driver, C. A. Briggs, A Hebrew English Lexicon (Oxford, 1907), p. 299. 248</page><page sequence="13">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII The choice between "house" or "altar" does not affect the Syriac whose significant variant is what it adds, namely: "Who in their poverty raised up the altar". It is difficult to see why the reference to poverty should have been in- serted, unless the translator felt very strongly about it. A further characteristic of the Syriac translation is the way in which the wording has been re-phrased to avoid anthropomorphisms in the Hebrew (or Greek) text. Since this tendency was not confined to the Ebionites, but was characteristic of other groups in early Judaism, its value as evidence is reduced. Consequently I will merely note the places where it occurs. On the assumption that the Ebionites made the translation such alterations are readily explicable, and are consistent with the other evidence. However, taken on their own they would not have decisive probative value. The passages where the Syriac has avoided or toned down an anthropomorphism are as follows: xi 12c, xi 21c, xxxii(xxxv) 6b, xxxii(xxxv) 8, xxxv(xxxii) 13, xxxix 28d, xlv 2a. There is one more which needs a brief word of elucidation. In xlii 18 an obscure passage has been made clear thanks to the discovery of the Masada fragment, which con- serves the verse in two lines, as do the Greek and Syriac, while the pre- viously known Hebrew source (manuscript B) had only one line at this point. As conserved in M the verse can be read: a) "He searches the deep and the heart, b) And their secrets he surveys, c) For the Most High possesses knowledge, d) nt7Pi ninK n"r [ ]" The translation of the last half line hinges upon the meaning which is to be assigned to 'tywt. Is it the feminine participle of 'th, "to come," as Yadin assumes 3), or is it the plural of 'wt, "a sign"? Evidently the Septuagint translator took it in the latter sense as the Greek version reads oqtiSuov aoivo . I suggest that the Syrian writer understood it in this way too, which explains his desire to alter it. The suggestion that God was depen- dent on the "signs of the ages" in order to know the future was too anthro- pomorphic for him and he rendered it as a) "The deep and the heart he examines, b) And all the thoughts of the sons of men, c) Are laid bare before him like the sun, d) Because nothing is hidden before God". The last group of alterations which need to be examined are the changes introduced in the Syriac when biblical quotations have been inserted into the text of Ben Sira. Middendorp has identified some sixty allusions or citations of other biblical books in Ben Sira 4), but only three of them 3) Y. Yadin, p. 45, as in Isaiah xli 23. 4) Th. Middendorp, Die Stellung Jesus ben Siras Zwischen Judentum und Helle- nismus (Leiden, 1973), pp. 35 ff. 249</page><page sequence="14">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII are unmistakably textual quotations, namely Mal. iv 6, Jer. i 10, and Ezech. xiv 14. The first of these, Mal. iv 6, is inserted in Ben Sira xlviii 10c. In its original setting the quotation from Malachi reads thus: whIyb Ib- 'bwit /l bnym wlb bnym cl 'bwtm. When it was quoted in the original text of Ben Sira, the first half of the line was copied exactly: Ihyb b lb 'bt cI bnym. Yet when the Syriac translation was made, the wording is seen to have undergone an apparently motiveless alteration: "To convert the sons to the fathers" (Imhpkwv bny,' 'l bh). Whence did this rendering come? In addition to the Hebrew text of Malachi, the Syrian writer might have derived his knowledge of the verse from the Syriac translation of the prophet, or from its use in Luke i 17 (either in Greek or Syriac). In all these sources the wording is the same as in the original. One is left with the simple alternatives: either the Syrian translator made a simple error when translating this quotation, or he had a definite motive for not wishing to quote the prophet exactly as his words were written. The citation of Jer. i 10 in Ben Sira xlix 7 c and d manifests similar complications. The prophet is given his instructions which are expressed in six verbs: Intws wilntnws wlh'byd wlhrws Ibnwt wilntw'. When this was incorporated into Ben Sira the author made minor changes in the first part, but retained the same six verbs: "And he from the womb was formed a prophet To uproot and to pull down and to destroy and to throw down And so to build to plant and to restore" (whwv' mrhm nwsr nby) Intwi wlntwss wlh'byd lhrs wkn Ibnt Int) wlhSyb). When this passage was inserted into the Syriac translation of Ben Sira, only the first part was translated: "In the days of Jeremiah who was a prophet from the womb of his mother" (bywmy 'rmy' dhwnv mn krs' d'mh nby'). Why did he omit the actual words from the Book of Jeremiah? Possibly the six verbs were too difficult for him to translate, but that is unlikely. Conceivably the Book of Jeremiah was not then translated into Syriac? This again is unlikely. Although the dates at which different books of the Bible were translated from Hebrew into Syriac are not known, it 250</page><page sequence="15">PESHITTA INSTITUTE COMMUNICATION XII seems probable that liturgical requirements would have ensured the trans- lation of the prophets before the wisdom books. One is left with the possibility that the Syrian writer had some kind of specific reluctance to translate an exact quotation from the prophet Jeremiah. Something similar must have been operative in the third and last example, namely the citation of Ezech. xiv 14 in Ben Sira xlix 9. The original of Ezechiel, in a context which speaks of the holy men of Israel, said of Job: ".. . and Job, they in their righteousness will deliver their souls" (w~ywb hmh bsdqtm ynslw nplm). Ben Sira does not incorporate it with complete exactitude, but it is close enough to see the similarity of wording: wgm hZkyr 't 'ywb hmklkl kl d[r/y s]dq The conjectural emendation done by Levi is so slight as not to weaken the argument, and the Syrian writer must have had before him a text like that which has survived. When put into the Syriac version of Ben Sira the phrase was altered yet again so that it bore scarcely any resemblance to the exact words in Ezechiel, thus: "And also about Job he said that all his ways were righteous" (w'p 'l ywb 'mr dklhyn 'wrhtb Zdyqwt' hwy). Bearing in mind the various causes which might have accounted for this alteration, as for the previous two, one is left with the conclusion that the most likely explanation is that the Syrian translator had a deliberate motive for not wishing to quote one of the canonical prophets verbatim. Just such a motive existed for the Ebionites. According to Epiphanius, they accepted among the prophets only Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and Joshua, but rejected Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel etc., namely the written prophets. The reliability of this information is accepted by M. Simon 5). In the preceding pages I have hinted that a large number of alterations can be accounted for on the hypothesis that an Ebionite translated Ben Sira into Syriac and in doing so altered the wording to bring it into line with the distinctive theology of their sect. In addition to the large-scale modification at the beginning of chapter xxxii (xxxv) there are a further thirty-two places where significant alterations can be accounted for by this hypothesis. The time has therefore come to state clearly which of the Ebionite characteristics are to be found in these alterations and which of them do not occur. We are well informed about the Ebionites from patristic sources partic- ularly the Panarion of Epiphanius6). Their own writings survive merged 5) M.

Schoeps 7). In the distinctive alterations in the Syriac version of Ben Sira we see several clear ideas crystallised, namely reluctance to speak about sacrifices, hostility to the priesthood, vegetarianism, hostility to the monarchy, a preference for poverty, the elimination of anthropomorphisms, and reluctance to quote the written prophets. All these are noted by Schoeps (pp. 147-240) in his systematic analysis of the distinctive marks of Ebionite theology. In the list of these characteristics as identified by Schoeps, the only ones which I have not detected among the Syriac peculiarities of Ben Sira are hostility to the temple, the title "true prophet" for the Messiah, and the use of salt for the Eucharist. The absence of the last two should not cause surprise. The concurrence of so many of these Ebionite charac- teristics with the alterations in the Syriac version of Ben Sira is impressive, and cannot easily be dismissed as accidental. There are however various arguments for and against the attribution of the translation to the Ebionites which must be examined. First, we must ask why they would be interested in this book. Ac- cording to Epiphanius their "canon" of scripture was the Pentateuch, so they would scarcely be interested in a late wisdom book. To this one can simply reply that their translating it would not imply that they regarded it as canonical (although one cannot be too strict about the significance of that term at the beginning of the Christian era). In my opinion, the value which Ben Sira ascribes to poverty would supply the motive which can account for the Ebionites' taking a serious interest in the book. A difficulty of a more general nature is that the overall trend of the Syriac alterations coincides with the spirit of a widely-based orientation of sentiment in Judaism at the beginning of the Christian era, namely the tendency to down-grade the material sacrifices of the temple, and to stress more the value of a spiritualised worship. Theoretically these al- terations could have been made by any Jews of this spiritualising tendency, at a time (the first few Christian centuries) when we are singularly ill informed about large areas of Jewish religious life and sentiment. Is there any compelling reason for identifying the Ebionites as the translators rather than any other group or individual imbued with this outlook, which was then widespread in Judaism? For instance, could it not have been done by the Essenes? They were hostile to the temple sacrifices, and they were most probably the editors who produced what has sur- vived as the secondary Greek version of Ben Sira 8). This possibility can be dismissed quite easily. Unlike the Ebionites, the Essenes objected partic- ularly to the priests who were in charge of the temple in their own day. For that reason they did not go to its services, but we have the authority of Josephus for the fact that they sent offerings there to be sacrifices on their behalf, but in their absence 9). In addition there is the insuperable 7) H. J. Schoeps, Theologie und Gescbichte des Judenchristentums (Tibingen, 1949). 8) C. Kearns, art.

It is unlikely that the book of Ben Sira was translated into Syriac earlier than the third century of the Christian era, and it is equally unlikely that the Essenes survived as a community to that late date. As far as any other claim on behalf of a Jewish translator is concerned, it is rendered extremely unlikely because of the contraction of the Jewish canon of scripture after the Synod of Jamnia. In spite of all the imprecisions about what is meant at that date by canonical scripture, it is unlikely that any individual or group in mainstream Judaism would have troubled to translate a book which was retained in the Christian Bible but which was excluded from official Jewish use. So although the arguments do not add up to more than probability, the case for the Ebionite origin of the Syriac translation is reasonable. All the known facts can be accounted for on this hypothesis, and there is nothing in the large number of alterations which is at variance with the theory. There is however one more group of differences between the Hebrew and the Syriac which must be explained if a full account is to be given of how Ben Sira came into its present Syriac form, and to these I will return in another article. 253 London M.
