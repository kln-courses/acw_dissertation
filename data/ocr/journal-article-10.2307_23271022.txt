ISBN: 978-1-84511-931-7 (978-1-84511 930-0 hbk). doi:10.1017/s0009840x12001357 This fascinating book is an excellent addition to the Ancients and Moderns series, which covers topics as diverse as religion, medicine, luck, death, politics and gender in these highly collectible, pocket-sized volumes. The approach is one of rigorous scholarship and attention to detail, which makes these volumes useful for students and teachers from a wide range of disciplines and at an advanced level. The book is a synthesis of material on the art of the body. S. proceeds themati cally, combining art from antiquity with modern art theory and practice. There are welcome new insights building on aspects of the subject treated in the excellent volume co-written with N. Spivey, Panorama of the Classical World, itself an accessible approach to the science of the body and the history of physiology in antiquity. S. writes vibrantly and moves between chronological time frames with astonish ing ease. The themes explore a range of ideas from Graeco-Roman representations in sculpture to the Byzantine icon. The location of this information within a series of comparative cultural encounters from subsequent centuries produces a stimulat ing account. A passionate plea in the Preface forms the basis for the book: that antiquity must be central to modern approaches to art history and that like it or not 'the history of Graeco-Roman art bestowed us with our western concepts of naturalistic representation'. Moreover, S. advocates a return to material sources in an attempt to correct the recent separation of antiquity from art historical training. Anthropomorphic curiosity is at the core of the study, and there is a sense of pro gression established in its five themed chapters entitled 'Embodying the Classical', 'Figuring out What Comes Naturally?', 'The Ancient "Female Nude'", 'Stripping down and Undressing up', and 'On Gods Made Men Made Images'. The first chapter, which sets up a platform for discussion, explores naturalism as the most enduring legacy of ancient Greece and Rome. The grip of the body on our western psyche is demonstrated through the premises of naturalism, nudity and representation, and the Canova sculpture Napoleon as Mars as Peacemaker (p. 2) forms the basis for the analysis. S. examines the mechanics of the classical The Classical Review vol. 62 no. 2 © The Classical Association 2012; all rights reserved</page><page sequence="2">626 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW argument as established by Polyclitus and Vitruvius. An excellent range of images has been chosen to illustrate detailed depictions of body fascism and form, for example William Hogarth (p. 16) and photographs of the Farnese Hercules by Eugen Sandow (p. 17). A forthright debate on the body politic is enlivened by examples from the Renaissance, Neo-Classicism and the German Enlightenment. 'Figuring What Comes Naturally?' is a neat play on words to establish the core premise, that in writing the 'art history' of the body naturalism strikes its own pose at the centre of the discussion. The canon of proportion as represented by the ideal modular man is depicted with illuminating comparative examples such as Myron's Discobolos and the Riace Brothers. S. raises the issue of true representation of bodily form as opposed to simulated depictions of the body, with an emphasis on things as they are rather than as they are meant to be. He balances his discussion by introducing parallels drawn from Ernst Gombrich, often perceived as the 'father' of art history, whose polemic in the Story of Art is very strongly adhered to here. Chapter 3 treats nudity in a Roman context and reviews the Roman interest in portraiture and verism. The over-arching idea discussed here is the male gaze and the reciprocal gaze and how sculptures such as the Aphrodite of Cnidos were meant to be viewed and read in antiquity. There are interesting modern comparisons made with J. Berger's classic Ways of Seeing, where the discussion turns to a certain fascination with, and the differences between, the naked and the nude and where the power of the nude is expressed with a sense of voyeurism. Chapter 4 discusses the continuity of Graeco-Roman, free-standing nude sculp ture in all its guises through to the modern period. S. provides a carefully chosen selection of modern comparanda to illustrate certain sculptural messages of idealised immortality, from the Prima Porta Augusti (p. 137) to a marble statue of George Washington as Zeus by Horatio Greenough (p. 122). Chapter 5 treats the Byzantine icon and the essential differences between tradi tional methods of depiction and the Christianising of imagery; naturalism as the central quest is replaced by a perceptible indifference to realism, and the embodied image becomes disembodied. The bibliography, conveniently divided according to the chapter sections and headings, contains suggestions for further reading and guidance on some of the more theoretical and methodological approaches to art history. S. wears his knowledge lightly and has contrived to write an engaging story in a series of light yet well-informed sections. The choice of image to illustrate points is made carefully, demonstrates acuity and intellectual rigour, and shows a remarkably catholic taste. The balance between more and less well known images provides the right framework for dealing with this broad subject. This new and exciting book has much to recommend it for scholars of art history, classics and ancient history. University College Dublin LYNDA MULVIN lmulvin@ucd.ie</page></plain_text>
