<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vigiliae Christianae 22 (1968) 81-93; North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam THE DISCUSSION OF JUDAIC CHRISTIANITY BY G. QUISPEL Scholarly research has shown convincingly that Jewish Christianity in Palestine remained alive and active even after the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 and was instrumental in bringing Christianity to Mesopotamia and further East, thus laying the foundations of Semitic, Aramaic speak- ing, Syrian Christianity. Some scholars go even further: they think that even the Dead Sea Scrolls should be brought into the picture and consider the possibility of a direct line from Qumran to Edessa.1 Even if this last view deserves a critical reassessment, there is no doubt that Palestine and Mesopotamia are conceived of in our day as a special unit, independent of and of equal importance with Latin and Greek Christianity. Rome, Ephesus and Edessa are held to be the three main centres of the Early Church.2 This is the new image of the history of the Early Church, and it is important that our students should be made familiar with this idea, because it may be relevant to their present situation. In the first place it shows them that the Christian religion is not to be identified with the western world. As a matter of fact Aramaic speaking Christianity remained throughout the Middle Ages one of the main religions of Asia, and the patriarch of Seleucia-Ctesiphon ruled over a territory from Cairo to Peking and from Siberia to Ceylon.3 In the second place our students ought to know that Christianity has been interpreted in several ways, according to the genius of the peoples to whom it was entrusted: if Rome stressed the legal aspects of the new religion, and the Greeks developed an ontological interpretation of God and Christ, the Syrians were not very interested in dogmatic strife, at least until Ephrem Syrus in the fourth 1 J.C.L.

But then we find that this view is not so recent after all, that the insights were there long before the great discoveries of manuscripts in our time. But these ideas disappeared only a few decades ago, in the period between the two world wars, owing to a temporary eclipse of common sense in German scholarship. When we consult the authoritative textbook of Hans Lietzmann, The History of the Early Church, we find there that the Pseudo-Clementine writings, until then considered as the main source of Jewish Christianity, are nothing but a novel, a fiction without historical value.5 And again that Christianity in Edessa, in so far as it was not gnostic, came from Antioch and was of Gentile Christian origin. Thus the possibility that there existed in these oriental countries a non-Pauline Christianity of Palesti- nian background is dismissed out of hand.6 And this view is defended even in our day, because so many people begin their study of the Early Church with Lietzmann. Long before Lietzmann, as long ago as 1818, the learned August Neander had shown that the Clementine writings must preserve certain views of Jewish, anti-Pauline Christians.7 And in the course of the nine- teenth century the Jewish Christian source (or sources) of these writings had been traced with some amount of certainty. In 1932 Eduard Schwartz declared that all this was nonsense: whatever Jewish-Christian elements there seemed to be in the Clementines - hostility against Saint Paul, the primacy of James and so on - are said to have nothing to do with Jewish Christianity but to have sprung from the mind of audacious, bold novelists of the fourth century, who wished to legitimatize pro-Jewish tendencies within the then existing Christian con- 4 G.

And it takes some time before we discover the underlying fallacy. The pure critical reason does not explain history, it explains it away. It can explain away the historical Jesus, it can also explain away Palestinian Christianity. But such rationalistic hypercriticism is not sound reasoning. Historical research requires a more subtle tool, a more humble service, a historical reason, so to say. For it clearly is absurd to deny all links betweenthe Clementines and historical Judaism, of which Jewish Christianity is a part. It is stated in these writings that God has a form. This clearly is an expression of the concrete Jewish concept of God as opposed to the abstract concept of so many Greeks. The same belief is found in esoteric Judaism.ll According to the Clementines the Messiah and the devil are "the right hand" and "the left hand" of God. Such a conception is inconceivable in a gentile Christian congregation, where evil was considered as a privatio boni. On the contrary, it is consistent monotheism on the lines of the Old Testament and has its counterpart in the Dead Sea scrolls.12 It is difficult to deny that some continuity does exist between the Clemen- tine view of Jesus as the true prophet and the belief of Jerusalem Chris- tianity that Christ was the prophet promised by Moses (Acts 3, 22). And it has been proved that the Clementines reflect Jewish-Christian teaching when they consider James to be the primate of the apostles and remain 8 E.

QUISPEL faithful to the apostel's decree (Acts 15, 29)which elsewhere was spiri- tualised and thus nullified.13 With this in mind we should not be impressed by the excessively sharp reviews that were written after H. J. Schoeps had published his "Theology and History of Jewish Christianity".14 It was not so much that Schoeps was right as that his critics were so fantastically wrong. Thus they blocked the progress of research in their country; in the rest of the world Jewish Christianity became the great issue. Schoeps had the merit of drawing the attention of scholars to the problem of Jewish Christianity: and he showed decisively that the sources of the Clementines had a Jewish and in some cases a Jewish Christian background. One scholar who like Balaam went out to curse and finished blessing, tried to show that neither the concepts nor the Gospel quotations of the Clementines were rooted in primitive, Palestinian Christianity. But that, of course, is neither here nor there and was discounted by subsequent discoveries.l1 Much more important and constructive was the contribution of Jean Danielou in his "Theology of Jewish Christianity". He pointed out that the Clementine writings reflected the views of only a very special sector of Jewish Christianity, traditionally linked up with the prophet Elxai. It is possible that in these quarters the resentment against St. Paul, charac- teristic of a small minority of the Palestinian Church, and of the Clemen- tines, did persist. But the main stream of Jewish Christianity did continue the apostolic tradition of Jerusalem and is therefore called "orthodox Jewish Christianity". It would seem that this is the form of Jewish Christianity which was influential in the Christian church, much more than was formerly supposed.16 Later discoveries have consolidated this position. It is necessary to say here a few words about the Gospel of Thomas. It has now been estab- lished by Joachim Jeremias and Helmut Koester that this collection of 114 13 E.

But it is sad that the alternatives suggested were sometimes completely fantastic. Rudolf Kasser, professor at Geneva University, maintained that the Gospel of Thomas was a gnostic hymn without any historical value.18 What are we to think about the level of his mind and the methods of his scholarship? Willy Krogmann denied that the Old-Saxon poem Heliand has any variants in common with the Gospel of Thomas;19 whereas there does not exist a version of Tatian's Diatessaron which has not several variants in common with the Gospel of Thomas. Is not the editorial board of a review to be blamed for printing such biased nonsense? The Gospel of Thomas however does not only contain an independent tradition, but this tradition is positively Jewish Christian.20 So when James is held to be the primate of the whole church (1.12), or when the sabbath is imposed (1.27), or when the Pharisees are considered to dispose of the oral tradition transmitted by Moses (1.39). Though these sayings have marked affinities with the Gospel tradition of the Clementines, and so reveal their Jewish-Christian character, they show none of the parti- cularities of the heterodox Jewish Christians. They reflect the views of the "orthodox Jewish Christians", whose existence has been disclosed by Danielou. More recently Shlomo Pines has announced the discovery of another Jewish Christian source, contained in a 10th century Arabic manuscript written by Abd al-Jabbar.21 This announcement has provoked a lively debate among two eminent Arabists, which outsiders follow with interest.22 All we can say at the moment is that this text cannot be a pure fiction of an Islamic polemicist. It must contain some very archaic elements. This is clear from the fact that it has some variants in common with the Syrus Curetonianus, the Diatessaron and the Pseudo-Clementine writings. Moreover a Saying of Jesus is quoted in the new text in the following way: 17 J.Jeremias, Die Gleichnisse Jesu, 6th ed. (Gottingen, 1962). H.

This is almost identical with logion 72 of the Gospel of Thomas and very different indeed from Luke 12, 13-14. Although further publications must be awaited, we must agree with Pines that this wording ultimately goes back to a Jewish Christian source. But then we must conclude that the Gospel of Thomas too derived this Saying and others from a Jewish Christian Gospel tradition. We now turn to the relations between Jerusalem and Edessa, between Palestine and Mesopotamia. The tradition of the Church tells us that the Christian community of Edessa was founded by Addai, a missionary from Palestine. Addai is an abbreviation of a Jewish name, Adonya.23 F.C. Burkitt, as long ago as 1907, showed that this tradition was right.24 His main argument was that the Syrians considered the Holy Spirit as a Mother, like the Jewish Christians. He quoted the 4th century author Aphraates as saying: "As long as a man does not take a wife, he loves and honours God, his Father, and the Holy Ghost, his Mother, and he has no other love." This he compares with the famous fragment of the Gospel according to the Hebrews: "My mother, the Holy Ghost, took me..." Burkitt was right when he considered this to be an indication of the Palesti- nian origin of eastern Christianity. There existed an exegetical tradition among the Jews which interpreted the mention of father and mother in the Bible as applying to God and Israel.25 This device was also known to the Jewish Christians. This transpires from a passage in the Clementine Homilies (XI, 21. 2) where the obligation to love God is deduced from the commandment to love your parents. So likewise Aphraates is interpreting the biblical commandment to leave your parents. There is no doubt that Aphraates is influenced here by Jewish exegesis. But our evidence tends to show that this tradition reached Aphraates through mediation of Jewish Christianity. It is unfortunate that Burkitt afterwards gave up this right insight.26 Then he believed that Addai never existed and was another name for 23 E.

QUISPEL</page><page sequence="7">THE DISCUSSION OF JUDAIC CHRISTIANITY Tatian; which would mean that Christianity in Edessa did not begin before 170 A.D. But Addai must be a historical figure. There lived millions of Jews in these regions since the Babylonian exile. Christianity from Palestine recruited its adherents primarily among these Jews. The Pharisees, equally from Palestine, competed with them and sent their mis- sionaries to Mesopotamia too. This explains why the Christians had little or no success in the cities, where Jewish Academies did exist: Nisibis and Seleucia became bishoprics at a much later date.27 But where this was not the case, the Christian missionaries were very well received by the local Jews. They were of a different shade from Paul and did not irritate them by speculations against the Law. So it is said in the Doctrine of Addai, that Addai, when coming to Edessa, dwelt in the house of Tobias, the son of Tobias, a Jew from Palestine.28 We hear that the Jewish Chris- tian Elxai was in Parthia, when he received his special revelation (Hip- polytus, Ref: IX, 13). This shows that Jewish Christians were in these regions at a very early date. Why then could not Addai have been one of the Founding Fathers of Edessa? A second indication that Edessa owed its Christianity to Palestine is the name Nazorees. The Syrian, Aramaic Christians did not call them- selves Christians, but Nazorees, naseraja.29 We remember that the name Christian was an Antiochene invention (Acts 11, 26): this argues against an Antiochene origin of Edessene Christianity. On the other hand we know that the Palestinian Christians were called Nazorees (Acts 24, 5). This was also the name of the later Jewish Christians in Beroea (Aleppo); their Aramaic Gospel is called "the Gospel of the Nazorees". St. Jerome found these Christians in Aleppo in the fourth century; but they can have lived there long before. Again, these old observations are confirmed by a recent discovery.30 The inscription of Kartir, the Great Inquisitor of Zoroastrianism and persecutor of Mani tells us: "The doctrines of Ahriman and of the demons were banned from the empire and were destroyed (?) and Jews, Shamans, Brahmans, Nazorees, Christians, Maktaks were crushed in the Empire." 27 J.Neusner, The Conversion of Adiabene to Christianity, Numen XIII, 2 (1966) p. 144-150. 28 Doctrina Addai, ed.

CLXV, 1 (1964) p. 165-202. 87</page><page sequence="8">This shows us that towards the end of the third century there were both Christians and Nazorees in the Sassanid Empire. The Christians were the Greek speaking Gentile Christians from Antioch, whom Shapur had made captive when he conquered Antioch and had transplanted to safe regions of his Empire: there they continued to live, at first under their bishop Demetrianus, and had freedom of religion. The Nazorees can be both the Jewish Christians in the Persian Empire and the indigenous Christians of Aramaic tongue. What is so interesting is, that at that time, at the end of the third century, these two groups were still mentioned separately. And as far as I know, we have no evidence that there existed Christians in the strict sense, that is Gentile Christians of catholic stock, within the Arsacid and the Sassanid Empire before the capture of Antioch by Shapur. It would seem that the Jewish Christians in these regions could develop and proselytize under more favorable conditions than their Gentile Christian co-religionists in the Roman Empire. They did not meet with the stubborn opposition among the Jews which St. Paul and his fellows provoked. Moreover their relations with the authorities seem to have been rather satisfactory, especially under the Arsacides, but also under the Sassanides. All this was reversed about at the time when the Gentile Church was made free by Constantine. And in the following period the Christians in the Persian Empire as often as not seem to have been per- secuted, because the Christians in the Roman Empire had become the special favorites of the emperor. They continued to call themselves Nazorees. Walter Bauer, in his celebrated book on Orthodoxy and Heresy, does not pay any attention to the Syrian concept of the Holy Ghost as a Mother or to their name Nazorees: he does not even consider the possi- bility, warranted by tradition, that Edessene Christianity is of Palestinian descent. According to him it was the Gnostics who brought their faith to Edessa long before orthodoxy arrived there. But there is not a shred of evidence to prove that there were Gnostics in Edessa during the second century. Therefore we hold that the Palestinian origin of Edessene Christianity, asserted by tradition, is proved by scholarship. And we ask what light this throws upon later Christianity of the Syrian type: 1. The Gospel of Thomas, written about 140 in Edessa, can easily contain an independent Jewish Christian Gospel tradition, because the Chris- tianity of Edessa itself was of Jewish Christian and independent origin. 2. The Diatessaron of Tatian was written about 170 A.D., possibly in Edessa and probably in Syriac. It has always been maintained that the 88 G. QUISPEL</page><page sequence="9">THE DISCUSSION OF JUDAIC CHRISTIANITY Diatessaron contained Jewish Christian elements. This is confirmed by the undoubted fact that the Gospel of Thomas and the Diatessaron have many variants in common.31 Probably Tatian used the same Jewish Christian Gospel source and wrote his Gospel harmony to replace the Gospel of the Nazorees. 3. The relations of Bardesanes to Jewish Christianity are bilateral. On the one hand the author of the "fundamental writing" (Grundschrift) of the Clementines freely integrates part of a writing from the school of Bardesanes into his book. On the other hand Bardesanes considers evil as a necessary product of the mixture of the elements. This has its counterpart in the Clementines and reveals Jewish Christian influence upon Bardesanes.32 4. The problem of Messalianism comes nearer to a solution. It has been said by Kmosko that Messalianism is a survival of 2nd century Encratism and this is true. We now see that Encratism had very ancient roots in Syriac Christianity as witnessed by the Gospel of Thomas and the Acts of Thomas. This shows that Messalianism was not so much a sect and a heresy as the last survival of an old indigenous spirituality, which had existed in Edessa for several centuries.33 But here too we find traces of Jewish Christianity. I refer especially to the Messalian concept, so abhorred by the Greek Fathers, that God can be seen. This shows that the Messalians, as authentic Semites, had a concrete concept of the Deity. And this I suspect they derived from those Jewish Christians who firmly believed that God had a form, a body, and that therefore the image of God in man is to be found in his body, his outward appearance.34 Also the curious Messalian teaching, according to which it is for- bidden to give alms, appears in a new light. The idea is that Christians should be so poor that they do not have any money to give to the poor.35 This has its counterpart in the Clementine Homilies, XV, 10, 4. There we find an interpretation of the Word of Jesus also preserved in the Gospel of Thomas (1.54) and certainly transmitted in an Ebionite milieu: "Blessed are the poor, for yours is the Kingdom of Heaven." 31 L'tvangile selon Thomas et le Diatessaron, V.C. 13, 2 (1959) p. 87-117.

Kmosko, Liber Graduum, p. CCXXVIII and VII, 20. 89</page><page sequence="10">G. QUISPEL This is rightly conceived of as applying not to the poor in general, but to the faithful, who have become voluntarily poor (nitTrotog &amp;rZvrTcT;); they are promised eternal bliss and will not be condemned for not having given alms because they had no money (rflv ?Xrc1[to(15vrlV Jf] Tootiv 6ta To pI1f sxItv). Here again we see that Jewish Christian exegesis persisted in Syria; the impressive Syrian and Messalian stress on poverty as a special virtue is a legacy of Ebionitic Palestine. 5. Macarius, the mystic of the fourth century, was certainly a Syrian, though he wrote in Greek, and has certain relations with the Messa- lians. Now first of all Macarius was an experiential Christian, who witnessed of the experience of the Spirit in the depth of the heart. In spite of this he has a spiritual background and moves in a certain tradition, which is positively Syriac. Again and again he speaks in moving terms about the Holy Ghost as a Mother.36 We see there that the old Jewish Christian tradition persisted in Syria even till the second half of the fourth century. This also is a legacy of Palestine. And this brings us to our third point: what is the relevance of all this for the history of the Early Church in general? I think it revolutionizes our views in many ways. There is the relation of Gregory of Nyssa to Macarius. Present scholarship tends to agree that Gregory of Nyssa, when writing his De Instituto Christiano, was leaning heavily upon the Great Letter of Macarius and not the reverse. I must leave the niceties of this problem to the specialists, who may or may not determine to what extent Gregory improved upon Macarius and modified his views. But the simple fact remains that Gregory of Nyssa quotes in De Instituto Christiano, and only there, certain variants which Macarius took from the Syriac tradition.37 And this may lead us to ask to what extent the Neoplatonism of Gregory is an essential part of his mysticism. It seems to be certain nowadays that Christian mysticism existed before Gregory, and could be expressed without Neoplatonic concepts; for there is not a trace of Neoplatonism in Macarius and yet he is an authentic mystic, who knew the experience of the Spirit. We may further ask, to what extent Dionysius the Areopagite, when writing about 500 A.D. in Antioch, was familiar with Messalianism and was reacting against it. There was nothing that the Areopagite disliked 36 Makarius, das Thomasevangelium und das Lied von der Perle, p. 9-13. 37 The Syrian Thomas and the Syrian Macarius, V.C., 18, 4 (1964) p. 226-235. 90</page><page sequence="11">THE DISCUSSION OF JUDAIC CHRISTIANITY more than anthropomorphism, which means a concrete concept of God. Now we may read and reread Dionysius in order to save him for ortho- doxy and try to establish that he was not a pantheist, but a theist, and that he believed in a personal God. But that is not the real issue. When we compare Dionysius with Macarius we find that his was an abstract concept of the Deity, whereas the concept of Macarius was solidly con- crete. And that leads us to the further question, whether a Christian mysticism is not perfectly legitimate, even today, now that the static world view of the Platonists has faded away. Moreover there is the issue of asceticism. Owing to the exertions of Voobus many scholars now think that Syrian asceticism is independent of and prior to the monasticism of the Roman Empire.38 There is something strangely Jewish about the Syrian Sons of the Covenant. It has been pointed out that abba (abbot) is a Syrian word, derived by the Egyptian Desert Fathers from Syria; and some people have suggested that monk, monachos, is a translation of the Syrian ihidaja, bachelor; and this in its turn is supposed to derive from the Hebrew word: jahid, bachelor.39 So the word "monk" would reveal the Jewish Christian origin of asceticism in a nutshell. If this is true, must not we then consider asceticism as a legitimate offspring of primitive Christianity, which preserves its value even today? This is no popular speech in a welfare state. But scholarship is not concerned about topicality and has to say that, historically speak- ing, asceticism is an essential part of the Christian religion. Thirdly, our interpretation of the dogma of the Trinity is involved. Kretschmar has shown that the concept of the Trinity is not just a product of Hellenistic thought, but that this doctrine has its roots in Jewish Christianity.40 On the other hand it is perfectly clear that the Jewish Christian and the Syrian view was very different from the classical for- mulation of the trinitarian dogma. They admitted three divine persons, but one of them was a female. What strikes me most is that some of our Russian friends have not the slightest difficulties in integrating these findings. They commonly stress that the Holy Spirit represents the tender, almost feminine aspects of God. And therefore they consider the Virgin Mary as the personal revelation and symbol of the Holy Ghost.41 38 A.

QUISPEL History has shown that religion becomes severe and cool when the veneration of the Mother of God is abolished. And it does not seem as if a Mariology, which stresses the moment of human cooperation in the history of salvation, is completely adequate. Thus we may ask whether the Syrians, who after all were nearest to the source, are relevant to our present day problems. But also the relation of Christianity to other reli- gions is involved. Adolf Schlatter, in a masterly essay, once suggested that Islam did presuppose not so much Nestorian Christianity, but Jewish Christianity, especially its nomistic and prophetic aspects.42 I am not competent to deal with the historical problems that arise here, but it would seem possible that there is a relation between "the true prophet" and the religion of the prophet. But then the question must be asked: is Islam a religion of its own? Is a new religion possible after the coming of Christ? This question becomes still more urgent - and here I feel better at home - when we inquire into the origins of Manicheism. We are quite well informed about the religious experience of Mani; Mani was confronted with his Familiar, or his twin brother, who in- spired and guided him and finally conducted him to his eternal abode. This twin brother was interpreted to be the Holy Ghost. Now this pre- supposes Syrian Christianity. On the one hand Tatian taught that the Spirit came to the soul of man to enlighten it and formed a pair, a syzygia, with the soul.43 On the other hand the Syrian Church taught that the Guardian Angel, created before the foundation of the world, was the Image and Type of man.44 And it would seem that this belief goes back to the primitive Church of Jerusalem. For the friends of Peter say to Rhoda: "it is only his angel". This implies that the Guardian Angel is the exact Image and counterpart of man (Acts 12, 15).45 Must we not say then that Manicheism, a world-religion, is at the same time a Chris- tian Gnosis, which presupposes Syrian and so Jewish Christianity? So the Jewish Christian issue throws a new light on very old problems. It is relevant for the history of spirituality, of asceticism, of dogmatics and also for comparative religion. 42 A.Schlatter, Die Entwicklung des jiidischen Christentums zum Islam, Evan- gelische Missions-Magazin 62 (1918) p. 251-264. 43 Erik Peterson, Frihkirche, Judentum und Gnosis (Rome, 1959) p. 205. 41 Testamentum Domini, Rahmani p. 97. 15 Makarius, das Thomasevangelium und das Lied von der Perle, p. 49-53.

There and then I will try to prove the following theses, which for the sake of briefness, I present here in the form of statements. 1 Even before the arrival of Christianity the Jews of North Africa seem to have translated orally their Holy Writ into Latin. To their vocabulary we owe such key words as: revelatio, deus vivus, omnipotens, altissimus, salus, instrumentum, etc. (cf.R. Braun, Deus Christianorum (Paris, 1962) p. 555). The first Christians who used this idiom must have learnt it in the synagogue and thus have been Jews. 2 The Afra of the Old Testament seems to have been sometimes nearer to the Hebrew text than the Septuagint. This may be due to the curious fact that in the Hellenistic synagogue (and so perhaps also at Carthage), the Hebrew text was read aloud during the service and ex tempore translated. The Afra of the Old Testament may have been a local, oral targum, which the Christians inherited, because they once formed part of the synagogue (cf. D.I.Blondheim, Les parlers judeo-romans et la Vetus Latina (Paris, 1925) p. IL-LIV). 3 Tertullian is very much indebted to the Jewish haggada (cf. L.Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (Philadelphia, 1946) VII, p. 596-597). This also may be in part a legacy of the synagogue, transmitted by Jewish Christians to their Gentile successors. 4 Minucius Felix reveals a literal, ritualistic interpretation of the Apostolic Decree (Acts 15, 29): Oct. 38, 1: sacrificiorum reliquias et pocula delibata contemnimus = &amp;acXemoatl Eicoo06zcTOv; 30, 6: ut nec edulium pecorum in cibis sanguinem noverimus = altacrog. As shown above, this ritualistic and right interpretation of the Apostolic Decree was preserved only by the Jewish Christians of the Pseudo-clementine writings. It would imply that the African Christians even in the time of Minucius had to go to the Jewish butcher, if they wanted to eat some meat. African Christianity probably owes this interpretation to Jewish Christians. 5 The remark of Minucius (36, 3): "plerique pauperes dicimur" recalls the name "Ebionim", "The Poor". Tertullian explicitly tells us that the Jews in Carthage still called the Christians Nazorees: unde et ipso nomine nos Iudaei Nazaraeos appellant per eum (Adv. Marc. IV, 8). "Nazorees" however, was originally the name of the Jewish Christians. 6 The African translation of the New Testament reveals the influence of Jewish Christians, who knew Hebrew: Mt. 13, 15 k.: incrassa: cf. Jes. 6, 10 Hebrew; Luc. 16, 20: Eleazar for Lazarus; Luc. 20, 13: unicus for &amp;yaxnrlt6 = Heb. jahid; Joh. 19, 42 etc.: cena pura for rapaaoKEu1; villa (passim) for ayp6q = kirya'; claritas (passim) o66a =- kbod, "splendour", etc. 7 The offertory box in the church of Carthage still had its Hebrew name "corban" (Cypr., de op. et el. 15). s Moreover the Afra and the Gospel quotations of Tertullian, Cyprian and even St. Augustine have many variants in common with the Jewish Christian source of the Gospel of Thomas, more so than the Itala or other representatives of the "Western Text". This presupposes the presence in Carthage at a very early date of Jewish Christian Gospel tradition. On the whole, the history of Christianity in North Africa seems to have followed the same pattern as in Alexandria: Jewish Christian foundations, a gnostic crisis, catholic- ism under the influence of Rome. 93</page></plain_text>
