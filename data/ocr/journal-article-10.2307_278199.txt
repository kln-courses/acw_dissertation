<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY hatching is absent from the earliest component at Morel, Guadeloupe, whereas Jacques Pettijean-Roget as- serts that it is there, as well as in Diamant I, Martini- que. Evans adopts Bullen's term "Caribbean Saladoid- Barrancoid or Pre-Arawak" for the original occupation of Dominica, but Bullen himself employs a simplified and improved version of the term, Caribbean Saladoid. Several authors ignore the work of predecessors. Sanoja discusses the Guadalupe phase of Venezuela with- out explaining that Osgood, Howard, Kidder, Cruxent, and the reviewer have called this phase Tierra de los Indios. Evans informs us that "prior to 1966 no intensive studies had been made on" Dominica (p. 93), though Marshall McKusick conducted such a study for Yale University in 1959. Since Bullen did not himself find zoned-incised crosshatching, which is the marker for the first Saladoid migration into the Antilles, on Trinidad, he concludes that the island was by-passed, ignoring the reviewer's discovery of zoned-incised crosshatching there. Verin's summary of Carib culture is presented without reference to the definitive research on the subject by Douglas Taylor of Dominica. These omissions give the volume an appearance of poor scholarship which it does not otherwise deserve. IRVING ROUSE Yale University New Haven, Connecticut Archeological Investigations on the Rio Napo, Eastern Ecuador. CLIFFORD EVANS AND BETTY J. MEGGERS. Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology, Vol. 6, Washington, 1968. xvi + 127 pp., 80 figs., 95 pls., 15 tables, appendix. $4.50. Evans and Meggers have again produced an impressive monograph based on field work (Oct.-Dec. 1956) in an archaeologically little-known part of South America. The authors investigated a number of isolated habita- tion sites with shallow refuse deposits. Under these circumstances little stratigraphic information was obtained and none at all on architecture or burials. The two sites of the Yasuni phase, oldest of the four phases that were recognized, yielded a badly eroded sherd sample on which even the incised decoration rarely remains visible. Red slip occurs in a few cases. There is a single radiocarbon date of 50 B.c. + 90 (SI-300). The decorated vessels of the Tivacundo phase (two sites) carry intricate patterns traced in red paint with or without zonification. The age is indicated by a radio- carbon date of A.D. 510 ? 70 (SI-330). The Napo phase (seven sites) is characterized by spectacular pottery de- coration executed in a variety of techniques including incision, excision, and painting (both negative and posi- tive). To this phase belong the famous anthropomorphic burial urns with painted designs added to their modeled features (none was found on this expedition). The three radiocarbon dates do not agree well with the seriated sequence of Napo phase sherd samples, as the authors themselves point out (pp. 80-1), but viewed on their own merits, there is little reason to doubt the validity of any of them, once their standard error ranges are taken into account: A.D. 1168 ? 53 (P-347); A.D. 1179 + 51 (P-269); A.D. 1480 + 180 (SI-299). Accordingly, the Napo phase flourished in the 12/13th - 14/15th centuries A.D. When the Spaniards first arrived in 1541 (misprinted 1521 on p. 81), this section of the river was uninhabited. The phase, then, seems to have cover- ed a relatively short timespan, and this is supported by the seriational evidence which shows no major cultural changes (p. 81). The Cotacocha phase, probably a manifestation of "the recent spread of Quechua speaking acculturated Indians down the Napo" (p. 86)-the Quijo-is the last of the sequence. The report is excellently organized along the lines set down in the authors' previous publications. Pottery is described in terms of vessel shapes, pottery types, and types of decoration. The latter, too, are labeled as pottery types, but this is an overstatement: "Tivacundo Incised and Zoned Red" (p. 26), for example, is a pottery type that was executed on four plain pottery types! If J. A. Ford's classificatory system is basically to be upheld, it might be advisable to treat the types of decoration within a separate category, just as vessel shapes are now treated. A tentative reconstruction of Amazon prehistory is presented in the final section. In the authors' view, the advances of Tropical Forest culture were caused by re- peated Andean infiltrations which rarely, however, achieved permanency in the hostile lowlands environ- ment. This hypothesis can hardly be proven or rejected in toto on the basis of present evidence. While con- fident darts still dash across the maps, the text (pp. 88- 110) shows that the authors do not actually continue to support their earlier rather positive statements without reservations: "the spread of the Polychrome Horizon Style cannot be interpreted as a simple downriver move- ment" (p. 106). The final discussion, however, is re- stricted to the Amazon Basin (pp. 107-10) which elimi- nates the important and early center on the lower Orinoco River (Fig. 80). Yasuni is considered a member of the "Zoned Ha- chure Horizon Style" which, according to the authors, originated around 3000 B.c. in northern Colombia, pass- ing through highland Ecuador about 1700 B.c. on its way to Kotosh (Waira-jirca phase). From somewhere along this route, it spread to the Ananatuba phase on Marajo Island (980 B.c. ? 200), a logical assumption, unless an independent origin is considered for the cross hachure decoration there or an ancestral style older than 1000 B.c. is found in Venezuela. The origins of the Yasuni phase itself (50 B.C. ? 90) remain obscure. Was it derived from some source in the Amazon Basin (un- dated Jauari?), from an unknown complex in the eastern Andes, or from Tutishcainyo to which it seems to be more closely related? It is difficult to follow the authors everywhere on this hike of 3,000 years to scattered sites distributed over half a subcontinent (El Mayal!). The Tivacundo phase is not linked with any other known 122 [ VOL. 35, No. 1, 1970</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS complex nor with the preceding or subsequent phases on the Napo. As to the chronological discontinuities, which also are a major point of argument in the final discussion (pp. 107-10), D. W. Lathrap has shown that they often are more apparent than real (Am. Antiquity, Vol. 33, No. 1, pp. 62-79,1968). The Napo phase, thought to be intrusive on the Rio Napo, is affiliated with many sites in the Amazon Basin, which led the authors to recognize the existence of a "Polychrome Horizon Style." Their attempt to demon- strate its Andean origins by selected "Quimbaya" traits (Fig. 79) might be seized as a ready example by those who doubt the relevance of this type of cultural com- parisons, although the occurrence of negative painting seems to show some highland influence. The lack of any Colombian or Ecuadorian materials that could be ancestral to the Napo phase still remains the greatest handicap for their hypothesis, as it did in 1958 (Univ. of Arizona, Soc. Sci. Bull. No. 27, pp. 16-18). Moreover, it must be noted that urn burial (p. 94) is considered by G. Reichel-Dolmatoff (Colombia, pp. 136-40) as of probable lowland origin; Rancho Peludo provides early examples (Rouse and Cruxent, Venezuelan Archaeology, pp. 48-9, P1. 5B). The few available radiocarbon dates are remarkably synchronous, as should be expected from a horizon style, but they do not indicate where it devel- oped. Coari on the middle Amazon, dated at A.D. 1103- 1197 (P-373) is older than the two early Napo dates by a statistically insignificant margin, but the single date for the Caimito phase on the upper Ucayali, A.D. 1260- 1380 (Y-1544) fits right into the range of known Napo dates. The present evidence is inconclusive in many ways, but at least there can be little doubt that pottery was introduced into the Tropical Forest area from the west -or from the north, as the Venezuelan contributions at all times merit some attention. This pattern of west- to-east diffusion does not necessarily prevail in later periods. There are the considerable achievements and the relatively great time depth of the Marajoara phase (and its putative Amazonian predecessor), neither of which is matched by the Napo phase; and there is the Colombian evidence of extensive east-to-west penetra- tion of Tropical Forest groups at the time-level marked by the earlier radiocarbon dates of the "Polychrome Horizon Style." Therefore, marginal members of this horizon, such as the Napo and Caimito phases, may well have been propelled upriver by a "centrifugal effect" (p. 108) caused by ecological reasons or other histori- cal forces, away from the center of distribution located on the middle and lower Amazon (Figs. 68, 80). Are they related to the historic Omagua (Oberem, Rev. de Antro- pologia, Vol. 15/16, Sao Paulo)? No matter how this question may be decided, the re- port will always stand out as a well written, well edited, and detailed documentation of the aboriginal cultures on the Napo River. Special praise must be reserved for the abundant illustrations of excellent quality (regrettably, there are almost no specimen provenience data). It was definitely worthwhile to reconstruct the manuscript and redraw the illustrations after the first copy had accident- ally been destroyed.
