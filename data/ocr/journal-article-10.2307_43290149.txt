<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Reception of Reginald Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft: Witchcraft, Magic, and Radical Religion S. F. Davies Reginald Scot's Discouerie of Witchcraft (1584) is the first extant treatise on witchcraft by an English author. This alone would make it a notable work, but its real interest lies in the fact that Scot was uncompromisingly skeptical about the existence of witchcraft - in fact it was the most skeptical work on the subject printed in Europe during the early modern period.1 The first edition was the only one published in Scot's lifetime; it would not be reprinted for nearly seventy years. But why was it republished at all? The possible reasons for Scot's reappearance in print long after his death offer some fascinating insights into the reception of this important work and the ideas with which it engaged. This article begins by surveying the reception of the first edition, before turning to the possible reasons for its republication in the mid-seventeenth century: resurgent interest in the witch- craft debate, interest in magic more widely, and interest in Scot's hints of radical theology. The first edition of the Discouerie was printed by Henry Denham for 1 Two monographs on the work have been published: Robert H. West, Reginald Scot and Renaissance Writings on Witchcraft (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984); and Philip C. Almond, England's First Demonologist: Reginald Scot &amp; " The Discouerie of Witchcraft " (London &amp; New York: I. B. Tauris, 2011). The best modern edition of the Discouerie is that edited by Brinsley Nicholson (London: Elliot Stock, 1886; repr., Totowa, N.J.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1973).

It was not entered in the Stationers' Register, possibly because it was attacking an officially recognized belief.2 The Discouerie was, as Philip Almond writes, "un- ashamedly and unapologetically sceptical" about witchcraft.3 Scot defined his subject as follows: Witchcraft is in truth a cousening art, wherin the name of God is abused, prophaned and blasphemed, and his power attributed to a vile creature. In estimation of the vulgar people, it is a supernatu- rall worke, contriued betweene a corporali old woman, and a spiri- tuali diuell. The maner thereof is so secret, mysticall, and strange, that to this daie there hath neuer beene any credible witnes therof. It is incomprehensible to the wise, learned or faithfull; a probable matter to children, fooles, melancholike persons and papists. . . . The effect and end thereof to be sometimes euill, as when thereby man or beast, grasse, trees, or corne, &amp;c; is hurt: sometimes good, as whereby sicke folkes are healed, theeues bewraied, and true men come to their goods, &amp;c.4 "Witchcraft" encompassed both (ostensibly) good as well as harmful magic. Belief in it was perpetuated primarily by ignorance, either of the true nature of divine operation in the world, or of medicine or other natural processes. Coupled with this were the vestiges of Catholic superstition Scot saw to be still prevalent in England, and which led people erroneously to ascribe power to objects, charms, spirits, and saints. Both those who believed themselves to be witches, as well as those who believed themselves to be victims of witchcraft, were also likely to be suffering from mental illness: "that melancholie, abounding in their head, and occupieng their braine, hath depriued or rather depraued their iudgementsf.]"5 Then there were those unscrupulous conjurers who, according to Scot, used perfectly natural tricks to convince people of their magical powers, "either for glorie, fame, or gaine[.]"6 The root of Scot's skepticism was a belief in the absolute 2 See Rossell H.

While Scot's work was not immediately reprinted in England, it was translated into Dutch and published in an abridged edition in Leiden by the English expatriate printer Thomas Basson in 1609; this edition was reprinted in 1637 by Basson's son Govert.7 The only other English witch- craft treatise known to have received a similar honor is William Perkins's Discovrse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft (1608). A myth persists that James I had Scot's work burnt when he acceded to the throne, but there is no evidence for this,8 and copies of the first edition are not rare. Certainly James was not alone in attacking the work (as he did in his Daemonologie , published in Edinburgh in 1597 and reprinted in London in 1603). 9 Almost every English author who subsequently wrote on the subject of witchcraft mentioned Scot disparagingly (further evidence for the edition's continuing availability throughout James's reign), even though on many issues their viewpoints were not wholly dissimilar. Henry Holland, for example, who gave the fullest treatment of Scot's work in his Treatise Against Witchcraft (1590), wrote that it contained "horrible impieties"; he at least thought it should be "commended to Vulcan."10 Direct quota- tions from Scot are placed in the mouth of the skeptical character in Hol- land's dialogue. The editor of Perkins's posthumously published treatise on witchcraft referred to Scot as "the gainsayer"11 and Perkins himself wrote, perhaps with Scot in mind, how "the Witches of these daies haue their patrons, who vse reasons to prooue, that now we haue none such as we speake of."12 The phrase "reasons to prooue" echoes Scot.13 Thomas Cooper accused Scot outright of atheism; he claimed that one of the reasons witchcraft continued to prevail despite the flourishing of the gospel was that it was " defended and iustified by godlesse men" like Scot.14 7 Reginald Scot, Ondecking van Tovery (Leiden: Thomas Basson, 1609).

John Cotta, for example, in his The Triall of Witch- craft (1616), mentioned Scot as a good source for anecdotes of magical fraud. Nevertheless, Cotta condemned Scot for conflating the imposture of conjurers with the genuine supernatural crime of witchcraft.15 Richard Bernard, in his Gvide to Grand-ivry Men (1627), borrowed anecdotes from Scot, and used the Discouerie as a source of information on "Iuglers and their tricks" and magical charms; yet he nonetheless criticized Scot, explain- ing that the Guide was published to shew some ground of those things . . . which otherwise may seeme to be beyond all credit . . . which if Wierus , Scot and others had known, &amp; diligently weighed, they had not so lightly esteemed of the true relations of learned men, and imputed the strange actions, vndoubtedly done by Witches, and Deuils, only to braine- sicke Conceits, and mad Melancholie.16 In fact, on several fundamental points these authors, and others who did not mention Scot by name though they may well have known of him,17 were not as different as they claimed. Almost all English witchcraft theorists shared a providential understanding of affliction which led to attempts to restrain excessive popular belief in witchcraft, the latter representing a chal- lenge to the idea that misfortune was divine in origin, and thus a challenge to the authority of God. The popular conception of redress for misfortune came under attack for similar reasons; these works were polemics aimed at driving people to seek help from God, rather than from magic - particularly as practiced by white witches - and to repent of their sins, which were the cause of the affliction in the first place. Scot outlined the doctrine on the very first page of his treatise: if any aduersitie, griefe, sicknesse, losse of children, corne, cattell, or libertie happen vnto them; by &amp; by they exclaime vppon 15 John Cotta, The Triall Of Witch-craft (London: George Purslowe for Samuel Rand, 1616), 66, 62. 16 Richard Bernard, A Gvide to Grand-ivry Men (London: Felix Kingston for Edward Blackmore, 1627), 33, 146, 180, 96, 135, 177, 188, 267 (emphasis original). 17 See e.g. George Gifford, A Discourse of the subtill Practises of Deuilles by Witches and Sorcerers (London: for Toby Cooke, 1587), A2r. 384</page><page sequence="5">Davies ♦ Reginald Scot witches. As though there were no God in Israel that ordereth all things according to his will; punishing both iust and vniust with greefs, plagues, and afflictions in maner and forme as he thinketh good: but that certeine old women heere on earth, called witches, must needs be the contriuers of all mens calamities, and as though they themselues were innocents, and had deserued no such punish- ments. Insomuch as they sticke not to ride and go to such, as either are iniuriouslie tearmed witches, or else are willing so to be accounted, seeking at their hands comfort and remedie in time of their tribulation, contrarie to Gods will and commandement in that behalfe, who bids vs resort to him in all our necessities.18 Later writers would echo this position. "Doth not Satans Policy in this trade of Witchcraft , pretending to afflict and hurt," asked Cooper, "Plainely obscure and abolish out of the minds of men, the Prouidence of the Almightie , as if Satan were not subiect to God, and sent by his prouide- nce!?]"19 George Gifford complained that "men do so little consider the high soueraignety and prouidence of God ouer all things: they ascribe so much to the power of the deuill and ... to the anger of witches, and are in such feare of them, that the least shew that can be made by the sleights of Satan deceiueth them."20 Holland, as well as his witchcraft treatise, wrote an exposition of the Book of Job, a foundational text for English witchcraft writers because of its discussion of divinely inflicted suffering. There Hol- land discussed witchcraft in the same terms: Let vs learne here of Sathan what witchcraft is, namely, the stretch- ing forth of Gods hand vpon vs. . . . Wherefore againe here we be warned by Sathan himselfe, not so to cast our eyes vpon these base and vile instruments of the diuell, nor vpon Sathan and his arts, but in all such extremities and miseries to turne speedily to the chiefe Lord, who hath sent Sathan with this commission against vs.21 18 Scot, Discouerie , 1-2. 19 Cooper, Mystery of Witch-craft , 319-20 (emphasis original). 20 George Gifford, A Dialogue concerning Witches and Witchcraftes (London: John Win- det for Toby Cooke and Mihil Hart, 1593), M2V. 21 Henry Holland, The Christian Exercise Of Fasting . . .

It was on this point that Scot's theology was a radical one; it meant witchcraft too was an impossi- bility, and it was this that led to accusations of impiety and atheism. Beyond writing on witchcraft, much of the early reaction to the work in print was positive. Gabriel Harvey wrote of Scot's work that it "dis- masketh sundry egregious impostures, and in certaine principali Chap- ters, &amp; speciali passages, hitteth the nayle on the head with a witnesse"; however, Harvey adds, "I could haue wished, he had either dealt somewhat more curteously with Monsieur Bodine, or confuted him somwhat more effectually."26 Harvey's antagonist Thomas Nashe also knew the Dis- couerie , referring to it several times: as an example of a work that dealt with 22 Bernard, Gvide to Grand-ivry Men , 1 . 23 Ibid., 77-78. 24 William Perkins, A golden Chaîne: Or , The Description of Theologie (Cambridge: John Legate, 1600), 137. 25 For an older but still pertinent analysis, see John L.

And his writing the book under the protection of Bancroft, Bishop of London, whose chaplain he was, opens wide vistas of the tolerance of the Anglican Church for such ideas."32 Indeed, as Michael MacDonald has discussed, a generally skeptical position was official ecclesiastical policy.33 Thomas Ady, writing in the 1650s, claimed that Scot's work "did for a time take great impression in the Magis- tracy, and also in the Clergy ," and this may not have been an optimistic assessment: there was a reason, after all, that later demonologists felt the need to condemn Scot so vigorously.34 William Percy (whose brother, the "wizard earl" of Northumberland, is known to have owned a copy of the Discouerie ), Ben Jonson, and Thomas Middleton all used Scot's work as a source for dramatic material relating to witchcraft and magic.35 It is possible that Shakespeare did like- wise.36 The Second Report of Doctor lohn Faustus (1594), a piece of prose fiction, also drew on Scot as a source, as did Samuel Purchas.37 Robert 31 Harsnett, Declaration , 137, and cf. 136-37 with Scot, Discouerie , bk. 1, chap. 3. 32 Paul H.

Someone - it is not known who - liked the Discouerie enough to have a slightly abridged copy made by a professional scribe.39 As late as 1641 Scot's arguments were being rehearsed in private correspondence; Kentish gentleman Henry Oxinden expressed skeptical views on witchcraft in a letter of that year, not mentioning Scot but quoting the Discouerie nearly verbatim.40 Scot's work did see unacknowledged and very partial reprinting in two manuals of conjuring in the early seventeenth century, Samuel Rid's The Art of Iugling or Legerdemaine (1612) and the anonymous Hocvs Pocvs Ivnior. The Anatomie of Legerdemain (1634). The latter appears to have been popular and was reprinted regularly throughout the century (and indeed beyond). One line of attack Scot took in his attempt to discredit magical beliefs was to explain how a wide variety of conjuring tricks were performed, an area in which Scot had clearly done copious research. His work is renowned even today by magicians for being the first systematically to explain how conjuring tricks could be performed.41 It was this material, only a fraction of the Discouerie as a whole, which was reprinted in these two works. The Art of Iugling, for example, reproduced Scot's instructions on how to perform conjuring tricks such as "To conuey mony out of one hand into the other," "How to tell one what Card he seeth in the bottome, when the same Carde is shuffled into the stock" and "To thrust a bodkin through your head, without any hurt."42 Predominantly from book 13 of the Discouerie , the tricks were reproduced verbatim as the main body of this work. There were a few additions, omissions, and rearrangements, but the majority of the text was from Scot.43 Much the same material was reproduced in Hocvs Pocvs Ivnior , although here some new conjuring tricks were included, as well as new versions of Scot's woodcut illustrations.44 38 Robert Burton, The Anatomy Of Melancholy (Oxford: John Lichfield and James Short for Henry Cripps, 1621), 267, 71-72, quotation at 72 (emphasis original). 39 British Library Sloane MS 160. 40 See Dorothy Gardiner, ed., The Oxinden Letters 1607-1642 (London: Constable &amp; Co., 1933), 220-23.

This edition was printed by Richard Cotes and sold by Giles Calvert. It did not sell well; its reappearance in 1654, this time sold by Thomas Williams, was a reissue of the old printed sheets with a new title page, not a new edition, as is often claimed.45 The new title page was printed by Cotes's widow Ellen. A third edition, this time in folio, appeared in 1665, published by Andrew Clark and sold by Dixy Page. (A variant of this edition was to be sold "at Mris. Cotes's,"46 presumably Ellen Cotes, though the exact nature of her involvement has not been established.) This edition included anonymous additions to book 15 and the "Discourse on Devils and Spirits," utterly in opposition to the spirit of Scot's work. Though it clearly made an impact, it is perhaps little surprise that no reprint of the Discouerie was immediately forthcoming, given its radical position on spirits and the condemnation it had received by the king. Possi- bly the prevailing mood was more susceptible to such a work in the 1650s; official skepticism about the possibility of securing a conviction for witch- craft had been on the increase for several decades, resulting in ever fewer successful prosecutions. This skepticism was exacerbated rather than de- creased by the mass trials of the 1640s. But this alone does not explain why it was considered lucrative to publish a second edition at that time. The remainder of this article will focus on the seventeenth-century English edi- tions of Scot, and the three main possible reasons why this lengthy and typographically complex work may have been republished nearly seventy years after it was first printed, and over half a century after Scot's death. The first possible reason is a renewed interest in witchcraft, coupled with greater skepticism on the matter. The second is an interest in magic more widely: the possibility that readers turned to Scot's treatise not for its skep- ticism but for the practical information on magic it provided. Finally, there is a tentative third reason: the fascinating possibility that Scot's unorthodox conception of spirits found an audience in the radical ferment of the Inter- regnum.

This in turn reignited the controversy that had been fad- ing from view thanks to widespread official skepticism in the decade or so leading up to the outbreak of civil war.48 "Without the events of 1645 to 1647," writes Malcolm Gaskill, "and the energy with which they were reported, it is hard to imagine that there would have been so much fuss about witches in the next decade."49 The aftermath of the East Anglian trials saw a renewed interest in witchcraft in the courts and in print, with trials and accompanying pamphlets in 1649 and 1650, five more pamphlets in 1652, and two in 1653, along with Sir Robert Filmer's attack on the belief.50 Together with the publications resulting from the East Anglian trials, this was the most intense period of witchcraft writing in print in England since the 1580s and 1590s, if not in the entire early modern period. It was also a time in which skepticism regarding witchcraft was more acceptable, and although this had begun well before the outbreak of the Civil War, at first it appears to have been accompanied by a decline in interest in the debate.

A second major trial in Lancashire ended in acquittal, its only record in print a play in which the witches were figures of fun, and two (by the sound of it) similarly humorous ballads.51 The East Anglian mass trials in the 1640s reignited the debate, and this time the skeptical voice was much stronger. Following Filmer's brief skeptical pam- phlet in 1653, Ady published his skeptical work on the subject, A Candle in the Dark , in 1655. Ady was influenced by Scot and knew his work well.52 The publication of A Candle in the Dark may well have been inspired in part by the activities of Hopkins and Stearne in East Anglia, along with this flurry of witchcraft activity in courthouse and printing-house: Ady called Hopkins "a wicked Inquisitor," and wrote "what troubles have followed this Slaughter, blinde men may see."53 Perhaps it was a wish to capitalize on this resurgent interest in witch- craft, within a culture in which skepticism was more widely accepted, that was behind the republication of Scot's work. The title page of the 1651 Discovery expands the first edition's mention of the "lewde" practices of "Witchmongers," adding extra stress on their "extorting confessions, by inhumane terrors, and tortures" - it seems certain that this is a reference to Hopkins and his practices.54 It was not just that Scot's book was more acceptable after 1645, but presumably also that it was of interest again. Possibly the controversial nature of the Discovery and its reputation con- tributed to its commercial prospects. The fact that the work's reputation was considered a selling point is surely supported by the title of the second edition: rather than The Discovery of Witchcraft it is Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft . MAGIC While the renewed interest in witchcraft offers a reasonable basis for assumptions regarding the second edition, a closer look reveals that there 51 Richard Brome and Thomas Heywood, The late Lancashire Witches (London: Thomas Harper for Benjamin Fisher, 1634).

Another possible reason may have been that, entirely contrary to its skeptical intent, Scot's book was used as a grimoire by magical practitioners. The information on sleight-of-hand conjuring tricks that proved popular enough to be reprinted separately in The Art of lugling and Hocvs Pocvs Ivnior has already been mentioned. In addition to this Scot included a great deal of information on less worldly magic, such as charms, conjurations, and rituals. A large part of Scot's strategy in the Discouerie was simply to describe at length beliefs and stories relating to witchcraft and magic, in the (perhaps rather optimistic) hope that they would appear self-evidently ridiculous once exposed to plain sight: "sup- posing that the citing of such absurdities may stand for a sufficient confuta- tion thereof."55 Hence the work's title: Scot was laying bare exactly what these beliefs involved, "discovering" them to the world. It was probably both types of magic, supernatural as well as sleight-of-hand conjuring tricks, that made Scot's book popular amongst magical practitioners, in spite of its ruthlessly scornful anti-magical polemic. In fact, because Scot's material was based on manuscript sources and Continental Latin works, Scot was inadvertently making such material far more widely available for an English audience.56 The Discouerie "was one of the earliest printed books to provide examples of learned magic in English."57 As Owen Davies explains, the work was a treasure trove of magical information, providing spells, Catholic prayers, exorcisms, charms, talismans, and rituals on how to communicate with angels, demons, and the spirits of the dead. There were detailed instructions on conjuring up treasure and how to enclose a spirit in a crystal . . . Scot produced what amounted to the first grimoire printed in the English language, and while he did so to prove the worthlessness of its contents he unwit- tingly ended up democratizing ritual magic rather than undermin- ing it.58 55 Scot, Discouerie , 27-28. 56 See Owen Davies, Popular Magic : Cunning-folk in English History (London: Ham- bledon Continuum, 2007), 125-26; Almond, England's First Demonologist , chap. 4; and Butler, Ritual Magic , 65-66, and chap. 5 on Scot's sources. 57 Frank Klaassen and Christopher Phillips, "The Return of Stolen Goods: Reginald Scot, Religious Controversy, and Magic in Bodleian Library, Additional B. 1," Magic , Ritual , and Witchcraft 1, no. 2 (2006): 140. 58 Owen Davies, Grimoires : A History of Magic Books (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 70. 393</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JULY 2013 Almond writes that "Scot's book was remembered in English culture, not only for its skepticism about witchcraft and demonology, but for its inclu- sion of long lists of magic charms and rituals, sufficient to enable any aspir- ing cunning person to set up shop in a professional way."59 It was precisely Scot's skepticism that allowed him to be so free in publishing all this magi- cal material in print. No one who believed it to be efficacious would have dared to do so. Scot knew that what he was publishing was meaningless mumbo-jumbo; his readers did not unanimously accept this view of such material. We know that this portion of the work found a ready audience, partic- ularly amongst white witches, or cunning folk: practitioners of beneficent magic, usually for healing, finding lost or stolen goods, love magic, etc. Frank Klaassen and Christopher Phillips have analyzed a late sixteenth- century manuscript, apparently a magical text designed for practical use, that extracted charms and rituals from the first edition of the Discouerie , mostly concerning healing and magical protection.60 The scribe completely ignored the polemical aspects of Scot's writing (both against magic and against Catholicism), removing the anti-magical agenda and leaving only the rituals themselves. James Sharpe has uncovered evidence of a cunning woman found owning a copy of the work, presumably the second or third edition, in 1687.61 It seems likely that many more owned the work. An additional piece of evidence in this respect comes from a copy of the second edition of the Discovery held by the Bodleian Library. A contem- porary hand has noted at the front of the book: "s[p]ent on this &amp; Agrippa 5s . . . June 1655. "62 Agrippa was another name to conjure with (quite literally) in occult circles, and another popular author for the libraries of cunning folk.63 At the very end of the book is a personal index in another contemporary hand (possibly but not necessarily the same hand), giving a list of references to certain passages in the work - all of them to magical operations, such as speaking with spirits and under which astrological signs love magic is to be performed.64 It seems clear that this was another instance of the work being used as a grimoire. 59 Almond, England's First Demonologist , 146. 60 Klaassen and Phillips, "The Return of Stolen Goods." 61 Sharpe, Instruments of Darkness, 281.

Even the publisher of the first edition, William Brome, may have recognized this aspect of the work as a valuable one, as Almond suggests; there is evidence that Brome sold books for an audience of magical prac- titioners.65 The potential for use as a grimoire that Scot's book had may be a credible reason for its republication in the 1650s. Certainly there was an unprecedented outpouring of magical works from the London presses dur- ing the 1650s, presumably a result of the same breakdown in book trade regulation that allowed so many radical publications to escape unpunished during these years.66 1650 saw, for example, the first English translation of Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy.67 While Scot's skeptical polemic appears at first sight an anomaly in such company, the fact that it contained such a large amount of magical material, enough to allow it to be used as a practical guide to magic, suggests otherwise. The anonymous additions in the third edition of the Discovery (1 665) were clearly intended to capitalize on this aspect of the work's utility. Nine chapters were added to the beginning of Scot's book 15, on such topics as magic circles, "How to raise up the Ghost of one that hath hanged himself," and "How to obtain the familiarity of the Genius or Good Angel , and cause him to appear."68 A second book, of seven chapters, was added to the "Discourse upon Devils and Spirits," adding more information on the nature of spirits, but from a very different perspective to Scot's. The addi- tions were advertised on the edition's title page, "as Succedaneous to the former [i.e. the 'Discourse upon Devils and Spirits'], and conducing to the 65 Almond, England's First Demonologist , 8-9.

In an age when literacy was relatively rare and a source of power in itself, simply owning a book could enhance the impres- sion a cunning man or woman made on his or her clients.71 The larger folio may well have been designed to augment this effect. Certainly readers were noticing this aspect of the work's value, and it seems plausible that its pub- lishers did too. RADICAL RELIGION There may be a third reason at least partially behind the second edition of the Discovery , more elusive but perhaps even more interesting. David Wootton has argued that Scot was a member of the heretical sect known as the Family of Love, citing the similarity of certain of Scot's views in the Discouerie to the beliefs of Abraham Fleming, with whom Scot worked closely, and to key Familist texts.72 The views in question, primarily expressed in Scot's "Discourse upon Devils and Spirits," concern an alle- gorical approach to the Bible, hints of Nicodemism and a belief in the per- fectibility of human nature, and a positioning of the operations of both the Holy Spirit and evil spirits entirely within the mind. It was primarily this radical conception of spirits with which later writers on witchcraft dis- agreed and challenged Scot, and it lay at the root of his attack on belief in witchcraft. Scot reduced the operations of spiritual beings almost to meta- phor, for sometimes in the scriptures, spirits and diuels are taken for infir- mities of the bodie; sometimes for the vices of the mind; sometimes also for the gifts of either of them. . . . Sometimes a spirit is put for the Gospell; sometimes for the mind or soule of man; sometimes for the will of man, his mind and counsel . . . sometimes for zeale 69 Scot, Discovery of Witchcraft (1665), title page (emphasis original). 70 Davies, Popular Magic , 127. 71 Ibid., 119. 72 David Wootton, "Reginald Scot/Abraham Fleming/The Family of Love," in Languages of Witchcraft : Narrative , Ideology and Meaning in Early Modern Culture , ed.

Where it is written, that God sent an euill spirit betweene Abime- lech , and the men of Sichern , we are to vnderstand, that he sent the spirit of hatred, and not a bulbegger. Also where it is said; If the spirit of gelosie come vpon him: it is as much to saie as; If he be mooued with a gelous mind: and not that a corporali diuell assaulteth him.73 As Scot summarized it, In summe, this word [Spirit] dooth signifie a secret force and power, wherewith our minds are mooued and directed; if vnto holie things, then it is the motion of the holie spirit, of the spirit of Christ and of God: if vnto euill things, then it is the suggestion of the wicked spirit, of the diuell, and of satan.74 "Scot believed in the reality of the devil and the Holy Ghost," writes Woot- ton, "but located them entirely inside the self . . . Scot's demons have the same ontological status as Freud's unconscious wishes."75 They are the motivations within the mind: their anthropomorphism in Scripture was merely an aid to understanding. The "evidence" for Scot's Familism is fragile, consisting only of hints and somewhat vague correspondences. Although Wootton's analysis of Scot's theology is excellent, its conclusions are not robust; the allusions are simply too tenuous to prove anything either way. Wootton's analysis lays too much stress, for example, on the concept of the perfectibility of human nature, only hinted at by Scot. We must also respect Scot's outright denial of the belief, although given the situation in the 1580s he could hardly have affirmed it.76 Whatever the case in this respect, however, Scot's theology certainly was, as Stuart Clark puts it, "radically unorthodox."77 The allegorical approach to Scripture and the location of spiritual forces within the mind were echoed not just by Familists but by other radi- cal authors during the turmoil of the 1640s and 1650s, just at the time 73 Scot, Discouerie , 509-10 (emphasis original). 74 Ibid., 547.

He wrote that "there is no other devil, or spirit, or familiar spirit for Witches to deal withal, or to work any Enchantments by, but their own imagination, there the familiar spirit is produced from whence it came; and there it ceases to be when they are put to death."82 John Webster, another author whose radical reading of Scripture would later lead him to attack witchcraft belief, stated in a sermon of 1653 that "there is no greater Deceiver to be found then is within Man: No cunninger Devil , no greater ANTICHRIST, nor no worse WITCH then what Man hath in his own heart[.]"* 3 As mentioned, the Discouerie was abridged, translated, and published in a Dutch edition by Thomas Basson, an English printer working in Leiden, and there is evidence that Basson was a Familist. As Christopher Marsh writes, "Basson was actively involved in the production and, proba- bly, the distribution of H. N.'s [Hendrik Niclaes's] works; there is little doubting his committed Familism."84 More intriguingly still, the second edition of Scot's work was sold in London by the publisher and bookseller 78 For Familist beliefs see Wootton, "Reginald Scot"; Christopher W.

As well as the series of Familist tracts, Calvert published works by such authors as Winstanley, Tany, William Walwyn, Abiezer Coppe, Richard Overton, John Lilburne, Jakob Böhme, Richard Coppin, and Joseph Salmon. He was heavily involved with the incipient Quaker movement, publishing the works of prominent Quakers George Fox and James Naylor, among many others. Calvert's shop at the sign of the black spread-eagle "was the leading outlet for the works of early Quakers."86 As Ian Green and Kate Peters write, "between 1652 and 1656, over half of their [the Quakers'] books were produced quite openly by the publisher, Giles Calvert, already notorious for publishing works by Levellers, Diggers and Familists."87 Calvert's own religious inclination is not known, but as Adrian Johns - who calls Calvert "the notorious radical bookseller," "the supreme radical bookseller" - writes, "radical writers in the Interregnum could count on a sympathetic reception at Giles Calvert's."88 It was through Calvert that Laurence Clark- son was apparently introduced to a mysterious sect known as "My one flesh."89 It was in such company that Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft appeared in 1651. We do not know the nature of the relationship between Calvert and Richard Cotes, printer of the second edition of the Discovery. Given that Calvert was listed in the imprint only as bookseller, this suggests (although it does not conclusively prove) that he was not involved with the financing of the edition. In addition, Calvert only sold a portion of the copies: a variant exists with no bookseller's name on the title page.90 That Cotes was the driv- ing force behind the edition seems to be confirmed by the fact that Cotes's 85 Calvert published works by the sect's founder, Hendrik Niclaes, including: The Proph- ecy Of The Spirit of Love (1649); Revelatio Dei (1649); A Figure of the True &amp; Spiritual Tabernacle (1655); and The First Exhortation ofH. N. to his Children, and to the Family of Love (1656). Other Familist tracts published by Calvert include An Apology for the Service of Love (1656) and A Brief Reh er sal of the Belief of the Good-willing in England, which are named the Family of Love (1656). 86 Mauren Bell, "Simmonds, Martha {bap. 1624, d. 1665)," in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography , online ed., ed.

Intriguingly, the publication of Scot's book is the only instance in which Cotes is known to have worked with Calvert, which surely suggests there is some significance in this particular collaboration. Even if Calvert was not directly involved in the financing of the publication, he may well have been chosen as bookseller because of his radical reputation. With regard to the other possible reasons for the second edition of Scot's work, neither Cotes, Calvert, nor Williams printed or published any other works on witch- craft, with the exception of Calvert's publication of Quaker preacher Richard Farnworth's pamphlet on the subject (Calvert was Farnworth's regular pub- lisher).91 Neither are they known to have printed or published any other mag- ical works, although Cotes and Williams did collaborate on a number of alchemical treatises in the early 1650s.92 From these perspectives, Scot's work was an anomaly on Calvert's shelves. Whether or not one is convinced by the argument that Scot was a Fami- list - the present author does not find it convincing, for the reasons given above - his views were certainly unorthodox. But whether or not Scot him- self was a Familist is irrelevant to the reception and posthumous publica- tion of his magnum opus. The publishers of the second edition are not likely to have been any better informed than we are. Could it be that interest in the work was taken because of its radical suggestions? As Almond writes, on the question of Fleming and Basson as Familists, but making a point that applies here too, "this is perhaps no more than to say that Scot's work was more likely to find marginal [and] somewhat 'edgy' collaborators, and does not go to Scot's own personal commitment to the Familist cause."93 In other words, whether or not its author was a Familist, could the Dis- couerie have been interpreted as a work likely to receive a sympathetic audi- ence among Familists or other radicals? This is not, it should be stressed, because of Scot's skepticism concerning witchcraft per se - witness, for example, Robert Filmer, also a witchcraft skeptic and as far from being a radical as one could wish to find - but rather the basis for it: Scot's radical beliefs concerning spirits. 91 Richard Farnworth, Witchcraft Cast out from the Religious Seed and Israel of God (London: for Giles Calvert, 1655). 92 E.g.

At the very least it is a question of the reception of the second edition. Calvert had a reputation, and whether or not he was chosen as bookseller because of it, finding Scot's book on his shelves would surely have influ- enced those purchasing and reading the work. As Johns has demonstrated, early modern readers "judged the printed books they met by what they knew of the people, places, and practices implicated in their production, distribution, and use."94 Though we cannot be certain, there seems good reason to believe that contemporaries noticed the radicalism in Scot and took it to be an important aspect of the work. CONCLUSION A study of the reception of Scot's Discouerie suggests that the sections on witchcraft may have been far from the only interesting parts of the work to contemporary readers. Scot's explanations of practical magic, both natural and supernatural, also found a large audience throughout the early modern period. The Discouerie found supporters as well as detractors, and it was mined as a source on witchcraft and folklore, as well as on imposture and trickery. And there is much to support the view that Scot's radicalism, enthusiastically noticed by modern readers, was noticed by early modern readers too. There is no doubt more evidence waiting to be uncovered in annotations, letters, and commonplace books which may support or chal- lenge these suppositions. Any one or all of these factors may have been enough to inspire a second edition of Scot's work so long after its first appearance. This article does not aim to provide a definitive answer. We cannot know beyond doubt what the motivations behind the republishing of Scot's work were. Exploring these issues does, however, demonstrate the value in looking beyond the most obvious reasons for a work's publication, and that there is much to be learned from a consideration of the motivations behind new editions of works. The history of a work's reception could be highly complex, and interest in it and reaction to it could arise in many different areas of contemporary culture. We should not assume that the Discouerie was read for its skepticism regarding witchcraft alone. The reception of Scot's work was highly complex, and it travelled in directions Scot himself may never have imagined. University of Sussex. 94 Johns, Nature of the Book , 188. 401</page></plain_text>
