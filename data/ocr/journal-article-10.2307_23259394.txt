<plain_text><page sequence="1">Narrative Resemblance: The Production of Truth in the Modernist Photobook of Weimar Germany Patrizia McBride It would be difficult to overstate the impact of technologies of mechanical reproduction on the visual culture of Weimar Germany, as a flood of images from photography and film upended conventional models of cultural literacy after the media boom of the early 1920s. Within this context, film has attracted far greater attention than photography because of its explosive potential as a mimetic medium that can convey a sense of unfolding time and engender fresh modes of collective reception. Yet the photographic image was an even more ubiquitous and flexible instrument of visual dissemination because of the unprecedented proliferation of newspapers and illustrated magazines. Con temporary debates on the use and value of photography initially went through the moves of a conventional aesthetic discourse bent on asking whether pho tography could claim a place among the arts or should not rather count as mere technology, but eventually they ran aground on a seemingly intractable aporia. On the one hand, photography emerged as the medium that beat painting at its own game of verisimilitude, thanks to its ability to reproduce appearances in an exact fashion. On the other, this exactness turned out to be a skin-deep affair that lent itself to all manner of ideological manipulation. This aporia, it soon became clear, was not inherent in photography itself but instead was pro duced by the discourse's own outdated conceptual terms, which equated New German Critique 115, Vol. 39, No. 1, Winter 2012 DOI 10.1215/0094033X-1434542 © 2012 by New German Critique, Inc. 169</page><page sequence="2">170 Narrative Resemblance mimesis—the faithful representation of the experiential world—with verisi militude and illusionjsm and placed the label of truthfulness over the whole equation.1 Photography's aporia raised the question of how to harness the medi um's aptitude for exact reproduction without conflating exactitude with truth. This question engendered a fresh exploration of vision and its technological mediations in a variety of practices, including New Vision photography and photomontage. While Dada artists had already deployed photography's real ism in ideologically charged photomontages during the war, postwar news papers and photomagazines enlisted photography as but one powerful tool in a semiotic arsenal that assembled various visual and verbal devices—type, iconic symbols, the manipulation of space and scale besides titles, captions, and other textual inserts—to produce highly complex narratives. In this mon tage of codes and devices, the realism of the undoctored photograph was often used as a glossy veneer of documentary truth overlaid on the rhetorical moment of narrative. In reflecting on this development, key theorists of the visual came to identify this very moment—and the montage aesthetics required to unleash it—as the repository of photography's truth. In what fol lows I trace the surprising turns of this investigation as it unfolded in the modernist photobook, a hybrid genre that unapologetically placed photogra phy's realism in the service of narratives crafted through montage. In particu lar, my analysis focuses on the scrapbook assembled by the montage artist Hannah Hoch around 1933-34, which I read as a photobook of sorts that enjoined resemblance (the staple of a traditional aesthetics of verisimilitude) to produce an active mode of seeing. At the beginning of his 1927 essay on photography, Siegfried Kracauer sub jects a hypothetical reader of illustrated magazines to a test designed to illus 1.

When asked to identify two photographs, one of a famous diva and the other of the reader's own grandmother as a young woman, the reader, Kra cauer surmises, will readily recognize the diva but puzzle at his grandmother's image. Because he has no personal recollection of the grandmother's youthful appearance, Kracauer explains, the reader will be at pains to draw a connec tion between the photograph and the image he can access through memory, while he can promptly recognize the diva because he has encountered her innumerable times in the media. In other words, the reader's ability to recog nize the diva's photograph depends on his previous knowledge of the original's appearance as mediated through various sources. Her photographic image thus functions as an "optical sign" that can activate preexisting knowledge or mem ory; without this aid, it would be unable to generate any insight about the diva. By contrast, the grandmother's photograph appears as a "ghost," a spectral sign devoid of semantic resonance, because her appearance as a young girl belongs to a past that is inaccessible to the reader's memory.2 As Kracauer further maintains, the spatial continuum of the instant depicted in the grandmother's photograph comes across as a medley of metic ulously captured details—the crinoline, the old-fashioned gown, the hair tied up in a knot—that are eerily devoid of sense, because they cannot be placed in any meaningful context. Rather than convey "die Erkenntnis des Originals" (the knowledge of the original), these pedantically reproduced details depict "die raumliche Konfiguration eines Augenblicks" (the spatial configuration of a moment) (OM, 32; MO, 56). In a clever discursive move Kracauer turns the tables on the pictures he has been comparing, using the blank meticulousness of the grandmother's photograph to indict the photographic images that circu late in the illustrated magazines. The fastidious reproduction of images for which readers lack meaningful references substitutes the exact but empty depiction of objects, places, and individuals for substantive information. The photograph's blank precision is thus elevated to a standard of truth that pre empts and replaces the work of memory and the historical narratives that are key to thoughtful interpretation and judgment. As visual saturation becomes synonymous with thoroughness and truth, Kracauer concludes, the glut of images that propel the illustrated magazines obfuscates the world it purports to reveal (OM, 33-35; MO, 58-59). 2.

Hereafter cited as OM and MO, respectively.</page><page sequence="4">172 Narrative Resemblance Kracauer's indictment of photography's role in the print media is echoed by Bertolt Brecht, who repeatedly denounced the evidentiary claim of the pho tographic material used by the press as empty and dishonest, noting that faith fully reproducing the appearance of objects seldom provides valuable insights into a given state of affairs. In a laudatory gloss on the photo-reportage of the left-leaning Arbeiter lllustrierte Zeitung, Brecht went a step farther as he chided the bourgeois press for the pernicious misuse of images in the contempo rary photo-reportage, concluding that "der Photographenapparat kann ebenso liigen wie die Setzmaschine" (the camera can lie just as well as the typesetting machine).3 Brecht's statement targets the deception perpetrated by the main stream press, which in his eyes deliberately exploited the evidentiary force of photography in order to conceal the truth of a state of affairs. Yet it is not immediately clear what one should make of his claim that the camera itself has the ability to lie, as opposed to the deliberate manipulation one could ascribe to the photographer or the editor of the illustrated magazine. In other words, what does it mean for the camera to lie when it produces nonposed, undoctored photographs? To answer this question, it is helpful first to flip it around and ask what it means for the camera to tell the truth, or what is the nature of the truth the camera tells. In his analysis of the different semiotic layers that intersect in the photographic image, Clive Scott maintains that the basic truth claim of the photograph, or its authenticity, lies in its indexical status, specifically, in the moment of contiguity that ties the photographer, and by implication the photo graph, to what is being photographed. To use Kracauer's example, someone took a picture of the grandmother, and that encounter grounds the authenticity of the photographic document. But this authenticity, Scott maintains by draw ing on Roland Barthes, simply boils down to the statement "this was then"; it lacks any temporal depth or extension.4 In other words, if the photograph makes the past present by providing an unassailable record of it, it does so by witnessing to an instant that is utterly singular and does not allow for duration. 3.

In the case of Kra cauer's grandmother, there exists a temporal gulf between the reader and his grandmother's youthful portrait that the photograph per se cannot bridge. Or, to put it differently, the image confronts the reader with the statement "this was then" but fails to provide a narrative as to the identity and the meaning of the "this," so that it remains unclear how the reader should relate to the spe cific "then" whose details appear alarmingly blank. One could conclude that the photograph's moment of authenticity is empty. On its own it cannot vouch for the state of affairs the photograph depicts, namely, that this is in fact the reader's grandmother. The indexical moment does not, however, exhaust the signifying proper ties of the photograph, which is also the repository of narratives nestled at the iconic level, which aim to identify what is depicted based on likeness and resemblance, and at the symbolic level, which is concerned with interpretation and evaluation. For Kracauer's reader, the unsettling moment grows out of an incongruity at the iconic level, as the young woman depicted in the photo graph fails to resemble the grandmother he knows from memory. Because the youthful grandmother flunks the resemblance test, her image cannot function as a sign that activates available knowledge, despite the reader's awareness that this is in fact his grandmother. The spatial context that surrounds young grandma thus defies further symbolic operations and fails to coalesce into a meaningful whole. Instead, it unravels in the meticulously depicted details of an indifferent spatial continuum. But Kracauer's reader presents further rea sons for bewilderment, which are rooted in a perceived disjuncture between the indexical, the iconic, and the symbolic. As Scott explains, the iconic and the symbolic levels, the moments of identification and interpretation, open the photograph up to a semiotic game that far exceeds the evidentiary guarantee of the "this was then" while surreptitiously feeding on its authenticity. The mul tiple options and potential for manipulation this game entails make it impos sible to insist on the photograph's claim to unmediated truthfulness, which, however, is always there thanks to the indexical moment. For the diva, the three moments overlap seamlessly so that the reader has no reason to question what he sees, but for the grandmother, the authenticity claimed by the indexi cal and filled with the information about the woman's identity is at odds with the reader's recollection of her appearance. This incongruity endangers the photograph's authenticity claim and accounts for its haunting quality. Because of this incongruity, one could argue, with Brecht, that the photograph, the cam era's untampered product, can lie.</page><page sequence="6">174 Narrative Resemblance Or, to put it differently, such incongruity demonstrates that photogra phy's authenticity, while real, does not vouch for the identity or meaning of the objects it depicts. This meaning is articulated rhetorically and embedded in a context that must be illuminated. When Brecht polemically remarks that the camera can lie, he has in mind the gulf between the claim to truth underlying photography's indexical moment and the complex weaving of the iconic and the symbolic moments, of identification and interpretation of what the photo graph portrays. As he suggests, contemporary photo-reportage surreptitiously deploys the evidentiary moment of photography as legitimation for narratives that affirm or obfuscate the status quo rather than shed light on it. The menda cious potential Brecht attributes to photography, then, lies in this manipulation of the symbolic level, specifically, in denying the narrative/ideological moment at work in the way the press uses photographs and the active work of interpre tation this moment demands of the reader. As it has by now become clear, neither Kracauer's nor Brecht's indict ment of the use of photographs in the press is driven by a traditional distrust of mimesis, that is, by the age-old wariness toward reproducing the world of appearances, which is repudiated for being a deceptive veil cast on the true essence of things. Rather, they are animated by awareness that photography's potential does not lie in its ability to reproduce appearances in an exact way. If anything, insisting on this ability as a path to truth lends itself to ideological distortion. In his essay "Der Autor als Produzent" ("The Author as Producer," 1934), Walter Benjamin chided the rosy-eyed agenda of some photographers of the New Objectivity, whose proclivity to authorize photography through its aptitude for exactness wound up glorifying the given, so that even abject pov erty could be turned into a "Gegenstand des Genusses" (object of enjoyment) available for consumption (GS, 693; SW, 775). For Benjamin, a case in point was Albert Renger-Patzsch's successful, though not uncontroversial, photo book Die Welt ist schon (The World Is Beautiful, 1928), a compendium of stunning images of both the natural world and contemporary industrial society that extols photography's revelatory magic while ostensibly paying homage to the beauty of creation. Renger-Patzsch's work was driven by the belief that photography's calling lay in its capacity to transfigure objects by reproducing them with utmost fidelity.5 Turning Renger-Patzsch's reasoning on its head, 5. In Renger-Patzsch's own words: "The photographer should become fully conscious of the splendid fidelity of reproduction made possible by his technique. Nature, after all, is not so poor that she requires constant improvement" ("Die Freude am Gegenstand" [1928], quoted in Aperture, spe cial issue on Renger-Patzsch, no. 133 [1993]: 8). More generally, Renger-Patzsch's photographic prac tice was guided by the belief that photography's objectivity constituted a privileged means for reveal ing the "thingness" of things, that is, their utmost being.</page><page sequence="7">Patrizia McBride 175 Benjamin treated photography's ability to faithfully render appearances as a hindrance because its putative objectivity could be used as a mystifying tool for affirming dominant narratives about experience. Notably, Benjamin rec ommended critically formulated captions as an antidote to the manipulative claim to objectivity (SW, 775). Captioning, Benjamin explained at the end of his "Kleine Geschichte der Photographie" ("Little History of Photography," 1931), helps shatter the automatized associations attached to reproducible images. It not only makes it possible to take.control of and change the natural ized narratives in which images are embedded; it also exposes photography as partaking in what Benjamin, drawing on Brecht, called the "Literarisierung aller Lebensverhaltnisse" (literarization of the conditions of life), that is, as a powerful tool in weaving the narratives that authorize contemporary material and social relations (GS, 385; SW, 527). Benjamin's final remarks in the "Photography" essay suggest that pho tography's eminently reproducible, though temporally extentionless, exactitude is an explosive force that needs to be harnessed in the militant construction of truth, even if it itself should not be mistaken for objectivity or truthfulness. The medium or structuring principle of this construction was for Benjamin mon tage, a strategy for producing novel accounts of experience that reshuffle mate rials culled from everyday life and thereby unsettle its dominant narratives (GS, 385; SW, 778). Benjamin's emphasis on the montage principle recalls the closing of Kracauer's essay on photography, though it is worth pointing out the different spin Benjamin gives to his colleague's insights. For Kracauer, the clutter of photographs in the illustrated press formed a gargantuan collage whose arbitrary configurations encapsulated the self-forgetfulness of con sciousness. In its very indifference and disarray, the photographic patchwork spoke volumes to a consciousness that had fallen silent, paradoxically recount ing for it the last chapter in a history of self-alienation that might have finally reached a Utopian tipping point.6 In other words, Kracauer's account does not so much emphasize photography's ability to depict specific conditions, as Ben jamin does, as focus on the medium as a material witness to the latest stage of the history of being as consciousness. As a result, photographs in magazines tell the same overdetermined story over and over again, regardless of what they show. Benjamin, by contrast, echoed key tenets of constructivism in fore grounding the potential for new, emancipatory narratives to be told through the creative assemblage of photographic material. I now turn to a foundational text of New Vision photography, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's Malerei Fotografie Film 6. Kracauer glimpsed this possibility of reversal in the groping for a new order that was epito mized by film's oneiric play of associations (OM, 38-39; MO, 62-63).</page><page sequence="8">176 Narrative Resemblance {Painting Photography Film, 1927), to further examine the importance of mon tage in unleashing the narrative potential of photography as part of a complex interplay with old and new media. Moholy-Nagy's pathbreaking manual offers a comprehensive account of con temporary visual media that is not primarily based on the representational needs they fulfill or their aptitude for exact reproduction but rather pivots on an analysis of their material properties. As a result, a cleft opens between painting, which is defined by the calculated arrangement of pigment on a can vas, and photography and film, which are first and foremost about the manipu lation of light through specific apparatuses.7 As Moholy-Nagy contends, focus ing specifically on photography, one task that this manipulation can perform entails the exact reproduction of appearances, but this function is by no means the primary one, even if it has provided the rationale for photography in its centuries-old rivalry with painting. Defining photography in terms of light manipulation through an apparatus effectively unmoors it from the age old discourse on mimesis, illusionism, semblance, and verisimilitude that vexed painting in the Western tradition and makes it possible to appraise its value as a specifically modern art form in entirely new ways (MFF, 25-27, 31-35; PPF, 27-29, 33-37).8 Wherein lies photography's potential as an art then? In a key section titled "Produktion Reproduktion" ("Production Reproduction"), Moholy-Nagy locates the task of photographic art in its ability to produce new relations among objects by altering the conventional ties that bind them in the visible world. That is to say, photography is an art precisely when it does not reproduce existing relations or, to use the traditional discourse of painting, when it does not depict reality based on the naturalized visual conventions of illusionism {MFF, 28-29; PPF, 30-31). Moholy-Nagy's emphasis on producing new relations is driven by faith in the emancipatory expansion of visual perception.9 Within this context, photography becomes a tool for manipulating an integrated visual field through a broadly conceived montage principle, which he defines as follows in describ ing some photomontages included in his book: "Sie [die Fotoplastiken] sind— 7. Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Malerei Fotografie Film (Mainz: Kupferberg, 1967), 5-8; Moholy Nagy, Painting Photography Film, trans. Janet Seligman (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1969), 7-9. Hereafter cited as MFF and PPF, respectively. 8. This does not mean that Moholy-Nagy did not appreciate the advantage that photography's technologically mediated exactness gave it over painting. But he opposed turning exactness into photography's ultimate reason of being or standard of evaluation. 9. In Moholy-Nagy's discourse, relations (Beziehungen or Relationen) are a functional category that lacks any substantive determination.</page><page sequence="9">Patrizia McBride 177 aus verschiedenen Fotografien zusammengesetzt—eine Versuchs-methode der simultanen Darstellung; komprimierte Durchdringung von visuellem und Wortwitz; unheimliche, ins Imaginare wachsende Verbindung der allerreal sten, imitativen Mittel. Aber sie konnen gleichzeitig erzahlend, handfest sein; veristischer 'als das Leben selbst'" (They are pieced together from various photographs and are an experimental method of simultaneous representation; compressed interpenetration of visual and verbal wit; uncanny combination of the most realistic, imitative means that pass into imaginary spheres. They can, however, also be forthright, tell a story; more veristic "than life itself") (MFF, 34; PPF, 36; trans, modified). The composite images Moholy-Nagy refers to in this passage are marked by their ability to fuse different temporal and spatial planes in a simultaneous presentation that undoes their conventional ties. As Moholy-Nagy points out, the startling juxtaposition of photographic fragments enjoins their mimetic force in an imaginative operation. It enables them to tell a story that gives a twist to the conventional accounts in which given objects are embedded while drawing with full force on photography's realism. For instance, an ad featured in his photobook portrays the top portion of an auto mobile tire whose metal wheel has been replaced by a bird's-eye view of a city street bustling with auto and pedestrian traffic (MFF, 109; PPF, 111). By manipulating scale and inserting the street view inside the tire, the image inverts the conventional relation between means of transportation and street— the latter figuring as a metonymical stand-in for the city itself. The oversized wheel dwarfs the depicted city traffic, suggesting that the automotive traffic enabled by the advertised tire reduces distances and makes it possible to mas ter city life. In other words, rather than contain cars and tires, the city is con tained by them. When viewed against the backdrop of this image, Moholy Nagy's suggestion that the story concocted by photomontage can be "more veristic 'than life itself'" is not a statement decrying the maddening relativity of truth but rather points to the basic narrative and rhetorical work involved in concisely and effectively depicting a state of affairs—in this case, the circum stance that a good tire makes city life manageable by shrinking space. The reshuffling of elements enabled by montage does not stop at the manipulation of photographic material within a single image, however, but heralds a radical reorganization of the visual field—in Moholy-Nagy's case, the double-page spreads of his photobook—that jettisons traditional rules of encoding and freely juxtaposes the semiotic codes of disparate elements: mechanically reproduced images, type, iconic symbols, and blank and filled spaces. Thus conceived, montage fulfills and expands Benjamin's principle of captioning by situating objects in new, surprising contexts and thereby altering the narratives that give them meaning. It does so by harnessing photography's</page><page sequence="10">178 Narrative Resemblance mimetic power while relinquishing conventional modes of seeing tied to illu sionism. Specifically, its combinatory logic makes it possible to insert the anti narrative instant of the photographic fragment into contexts that give it nar rative depth, while making it clear that the story is a constructed one. In Moholy-Nagy's eyes, the artificiality of the story is not a limitation but a poten tial virtue. Paraphrasing Benjamin, one can assert that exposing narrative arti fice makes it possible to exploit photography's evidentiary power while steer ing clear of the equation of exactitude with objectivity or truth. Far from taking away from the force of the photographic image, this operation opens it up to a rich play of signification that yields novel insights into a state of affairs. At the same time, it is apparent that the rhetorical strategies that drive such narratives have no inherently virtuous direction. That is, they can be deployed in the ser vice of both critical and affirmative endeavors, as evidenced in the wealth of examples featured in Moholy-Nagy's photobook, which range from advertise ment to satire, from reportage to political propaganda.10 While Moholy-Nagy's discourse fails to spell out the emancipatory potential it ascribes to the combinatory practices it advocates, his character ization of their mode of reception provides important clues. In a gloss on a photomontage ad for a gardening exhibition published in Gefesselter Blick CChained Gaze), a 1930 anthology of programmatic statements by some of Europe's cutting-edge graphic designers, Moholy-Nagy praises the visibly assembled landscape it portrays, whose sense of depth is not created by the conventional means of one-point perspective but instead is achieved by clev erly juxtaposing fragments of different scales.11 This strategy produces an evocative landscape whose nonillusionistic quality leaves ample latitude for the artist's imagination without diminishing its realist force (fig. 1). More important, the impression of a landscape as a unitary, coherent object is not achieved through the synthetizing spatial articulation of one-point perspec tive, but is actively produced by the eye's ability to roam the image's discrete elements. In the absence of the visual hierarchies created by the devices of 10.

Courtesy Hattula Moholy-Nagy perspective (foreground and background; light; conventional compositional patterns), the eye is compelled to forge its own path and piece together its own account of the overall image. Moholy-Nagy's gloss suggests that the artist can direct this activity to some extent, but it also makes it clear that the roam ing is open-ended and ultimately uncontrollable. Photomontage thus construes seeing as an act of forging a path through the visible that entails choosing among multiple options and accounts. This is in essence a narrative act that fuses perception and evaluation, a mode of active behavior by which observers creatively interact with their environment.12 12. For an analogous appraisal of photomontage's potential by a prominent contemporary, see Franz Roh's introduction to Foto-Auge: 76 Fotos der Zeit, a photobook published in conjunction with the pathbreaking exhibition Film und Foto, which opened in Stuttgart in 1929 (Franz Roh and Jan Tschichold, eds., Photo-Eye: 76 Photos of the Period [New York: Arno, 1973]).</page><page sequence="12">180 Narrative Resemblance The narrative potential of assembled images was not lost on practitioners of photomontage, who often drew on film's narrative quality as a means of comparison. A case in point is Cesar Domela-Nieuwenhuis's observations in a gloss also published in Gefesselter Blick. In describing two photomontage ads on the production of massive metal containers, Domela-Nieuwenhuis com pares photomontage to film and concludes that film would be more effective in rendering the multitude of details that make up the production process, which in his assembled image is intimated by juxtaposing large-scale images of the containers and smaller-scale depictions of assorted machinery: "Hier wurde dementsprechend ein ganzer Film in ein Bild gebannt. Wichtige Standpunkte aus dem 'Film' sind in raumliche Beziehung zueinander gestellt, sodaB das blitzartig wandernde Auge des Beschauers einen absoluten plastischen Ein druck gewinnt. Er wird in Bewegung versetzt und befindet sich mitten unter den Dingen" (Accordingly, a whole film is here captured in one image. Sig nificant perspectives from the "film" are placed in a spatial relationship to each other, so that the instantaneously roaming eye of the viewer receives an abso lute plastic impression. He is set in motion and finds himself in the thick of things).13 The shared ground, yet also the difference, that marks the narrative potential of photomontage and film lies precisely in the kind of movement or motion that sustains their narratives, as intimated by Domela-Nieuwenhuis's remarks. In the case of film, movement denotes the unfolding of a fixed sequence of shots, while for photomontage the movement is that of the viewer's gaze. In Domela-Nieuwenhuis's example, the film sequence would immedi ately suggest the correct unfolding of the production process. Given the con ventionless simultaneity of photomontage, however, it is far more difficult to determine the direction of the eye's motion once the viewer is plunged "in the thick of things." This is why film would be more effective for telling the con tainers' story. One can conclude that the potential plurality of the narratives engendered by photomontage makes it a more ambiguous medium, one in need of being contained more than film.14 In contrast to film, the montage of still images can empower viewers by teaching them that seeing is not a passive registering of visual stimuli but an act of piecing together. As such, it is inher ently narrative, if by narrative one means constructing accounts whose unfold 13. Rasch and Rasch, Gefesselter Blick, 45; my translation. 14.

In this way, photomontage claims a truthfulness for itself that is not about exact reproduction but lies in the active encounter between an observer and an object given to perception. This truth is contex tual, plural, and dynamic. In mid-1920s Germany the valorization of montage's rhetorical and narrative properties became associated with a move away from the disjointed composi tions produced by Dadaists after the war and toward a renewed interest in figu ration as a means of storytelling. This reflected the new legitimacy accorded to montage practices, which went along with their growing normalization and commercialization in the press, especially the illustrated magazine. One observes after 1925 an increase in single-image montage works with clear figurative themes or works that combine single photographs in more or less explicit narrative series, often encased in a grid. It would be misleading to see in the return to figuration and the ostensibly untampered photograph solely a retrenchment carried out in the interest of advertisement and propaganda. At stake was rather a more-sophisticated understanding of montage's narrative potential as inscribing the experience of a complexly articulated field of vision traversed by-diverse modes of encoding (verbal language, manually and mechanically produced images, type, and the alternation of blank and filled spaces).15 The interest in exploring photography's narrative properties within a mon tage aesthetics is reflected in the rise of the photobook in mid- and late-1920s 15. As Roh remarked in appraising photomontage practices of the late 1920s, contemporary (photo)montage no longer served as the means of investigating the formal properties of a medium or challenging traditional forms of representations but rather was used for rearranging the given into complex accounts. This entailed an imaginative operation that charted a path between the illusionis tic rendering of appearances, on the one hand, and the freewheeling concoction of a fantasy world, on the other (Photo-Eye, 17-18). Roh echoes Moholy-Nagy's brief assessment of the development of montage practices in Malerei Fotografie Film: "Das heutige Ausschneiden, Nebeneinandersetzen, miihsame Organisieren der fotografischen Kopien zeigt den ersten fotografischen Klebearbeiten (Fotomontage) der Dadaisten gegeniiber .. . eine entwickeltere Form" (The cutting out, juxtaposing, careful arranging of photographic prints as it is done today is a more advanced form ... than the early glued photographic composition (photomontage) of the Dadaists) (MFF, 35; PPF, 37). Roh's and Moholy-Nagy's remarks echo Benjamin H. D. Buchloh's appraisal of the development of avant-garde montage practices in the Soviet Union, which initially enlisted abstraction to scrutinize a medium's formal constraints and challenge traditional conventions of representation but soon turned to a renewed emphasis on iconic functions and to harnessing the power of new technologies in serving the needs of mass society and ideological agitation. In other words, according to Buchloh, photomontage made it possible to reintroduce figuration and mimetic representation while jettisoning the canons of illusionism ("From Faktura to Factography," October, no. 30 [1984]: 82-119).</page><page sequence="14">182 Narrative Resemblance Germany.16 This new genre aimed to showcase photography's ability to ful fill old and new representational needs by focusing on a broad array of themes: the Utopian horizons of modern architecture in Erich Mendelsohn's Amerika: Bilderbuch eines Architekten (America: Photobook of an Architect, 1926); the marvels of natural and human environments in Karl Blossfeldt's Urformen der Kunst (Art Forms in Nature, 1928) and Renger-Patzsch's Die Welt ist schon\ Germany's social stratification in August Sander's Antlitz der Zeit (Face of Our Time, 1929); the contemporary range of photographic technology in Franz Roh and Jan Tschichold's Foto-Auge (Photo-Eye, 1929) and Werner Graff's Es kommt der neue Fotograf(Here Comes the New Pho tographer, 1929). At the same time, photobooks offered a media-specific tool for a theoretical and pedagogical reflection on photography's potential that could not take place in photo-reportage or the illustrated magazine. What distinguished the photobook is not simply that it provided accounts of the world that privileged visual over literary strategies. Rather, its images were endowed with a performative quality; that is, they were meant to demonstrate the representational strategies proper to the photographic medium, which the photobook sought to foreground and reflect on. In other words, if the deploy ment of photographs in the press and especially in photo-reportage adopted the realist conceit of the story that tells itself and thus concealed the medium's rhetorical ability to shape the act of narration, the photobook made this very moment a part of the stories it told. Moholy-Nagy's Malerei Fotografie Film is often regarded as the proto type of the photobook, displaying several of the features that for Hanne Ber gius define the genre in interwar Germany: imaginative layouts that encour aged a mode of perception predicated on simultaneity and the viewer's ability to actively combine various kinds of information; the inclusion of various images that spurred multiple kinds of visual engagement, from distracted glancing to intense scrutiny; the rejection of a strictly linear or causal sequenc ing of the pictures, which were instead arranged in associative groups suggest ing multiple combinations and competing narratives; and the inclusion of methodological and didactic considerations—often relegated to introductory sections—that were designed to emphasize the distinctive expressive power of the photographic image.17 Moholy-Nagy's methodological considerations on 16.

In other words, if the photobook emerges as the medium for a self-reflexive inquiry into a field of vision saturated by mechanically repro duced images, montage names the grammar of this investigation. Sometime between 1933 and 1934 Hannah Hoch pasted 421 images taken from German-language and foreign illustrated magazines onto two issues of Die Dame, the most successful fashion periodical of the Weimar era.18 The images survey many popular themes that dominated the visual culture of the defunct Weimar Republic: the cult of fitness and the body, film stars, the New Woman and its attendant ideal of femininity, the marvels of the natural world and contemporary technology, exotic landscapes and peoples, travel, and the joys of children and pets (especially cats). Notably absent are references to the political and economic turmoil of the last Weimar years, to inflation, mass unemployment, and street violence. Hoch left no statement as to the purpose or even the title of this work, which she saved until her death. While it bears some resemblance to the archive books used by contemporary photographers to organize pictures for future use,19 it has been customarily treated as a scrap book of sorts that documents Hoch's private enjoyment of the lures of consum erism and the reveries of Weimar culture. Based on this psychological reading, the scrapbook was for Hoch an escape valve that enabled her to indulge the disingenuous promises of a market-driven mass culture even as she was busy deconstructing these very promises in her merciless photomontages.20 18. The work, generally referred to as an archive book or scrapbook, is part of the considerable Hoch holdings of the Berlinische Galerie, which has also overseen its publication in a facsimile volume edited by Gunda Luyken: Hannah Hoch Album (Ostfildern-Ruit: Cantz, 2004). 19. Luyken compares the scrapbook to the archive book of Karl Blossfeldt, who organized his contact sheets by subject. At the same time, she notes that Hoch's organizational principles are not systematic, unlike Blossfeldt's, but associative {Hannah Hoch Album, iv). 20. Maud Lavin derives her primary criterion for assessing the scrapbook from Hoch's famed photomontages, which she sees as informed by a mix of pleasure and anger that endows them with a unique critical edge. In Lavin's view, the images in the scrapbook lack this incongruous motiva tion and indulge in a naive utopianism, when they do not altogether revel in capitalism's guilty pleasures ("Hannah Hoch's Mass Media Scrapbook: Utopias of the Twenties," in Cut with the Kitchen Knife [New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1993], 71-121). Melissa Johnson also reads the scrap book as Hoch's personal response to contemporary events and an instrument for working through a difficult phase in her personal life (illness, professional setbacks, and increasing isolation because of the rise of National Socialism). Johnson sees the scrapbook's highly personal quality confirmed by Hoch's habit of making scrapbooks as a young girl ('"On the Strength of My Imagination': Visions of</page><page sequence="16">184 Narrative Resemblance I believe that the rise of the modernist photobook in Weimar Germany provides a different context for appraising Hoch's scrapbook, one that fore grounds the inquiry it unfolds into the construction of visual meaning and the complex narratives made possible by the montage principle.21 Following photobook conventions, Hoch's scrapbook primarily contains undoctored photo-reproductions, though there are a few examples of visibly cropped images. While most photobooks of the time featured one photograph per page, however, Hoch's scrapbook typically arranges three to eight photographs on a given page, usually in a grid format that recalls the conventions of the illus trated press. Unlike the commercial photobook, Hoch's scrapbook has no title that would suggest an overarching theme; furthermore, it lacks page numbers or other systems of reference, as well as any explanatory apparatus. Finally, many images have no caption or title and are unattributed. Where captions are present, they are generally printed in a small font and often in gothic type, which makes for limited legibility. The idiosyncratic arrangement of these tex tual inserts often complicates what appears to be an already crowded layout rather than help in its disambiguation. I would like to begin my analysis by accounting for the seemingly affirmative quality that for many critics suffuses the scrapbook's montage of images and that forms a stark contrast to the biting incisiveness of Hoch's Weimar Culture in the Scrapbook of Hannah Hoch" [PhD diss.. University of Michigan, 2001], 99, 102). There is ample thematic overlap between the subjects addressed in the scrapbook and those of the biting photomontages that have cemented Hoch's reputation as one of the Weimar era's most inci sive visual artists. In several instances Hoch even used the same images in the photomontages and in the scrapbook. The scrapbook cannot be considered preparatory work for the photomontages, how ever, because it was clearly composed later than most of them (Luyken, Hannah Hoch Album, vi). 21. Several factors speak for reading the scrapbook as a commentary on the contemporary photobook. Though its images date from 1919-33, scholars agree that it was not assembled gradually as a repository for images collected over time but rather is a tightly structured project that Hoch executed within a short time span by drawing on her extensive picture collection. That the work also includes photos featured prominently in other photobooks suggests an intertextual dialogue with the genre. Like the images of a photobook, Hoch's pictures cover a spectrum of schools and styles, from the conventional genres of traditional photography (the portrait, the snapshot, the panoramic image) to both realist and abstract New Vision photography. In their lack of reference to specific his torical events, the images recall the kind of pictures characteristic of the photobook, which placed a premium on formal features while shunning the merely anecdotal and time-bound. Finally, Hoch's associative arrangement of popular themes and subjects, if admittedly idiosyncratic, lacks overt per sonal accents and instead recalls the exploration of seeing and of the photographic medium that unfolds in many Weimar-era photobooks. To my knowledge, Bergius is the only critic who discusses, even briefly, Hoch's scrapbook in the context of the modernist photobook. Hoch was quite familiar with the genre, having published her photos in Moholy-Nagy's Malerei Fotografie Film and Roh and Tschichold's Foto-Auge, among other collections.</page><page sequence="17">Patrizia McBride 185 photomontages. If the scrapbook appears to lack the critical force of the lat ter, this is because the montage principle at work in the photomontages is predicated on a different semiotic strategy than that of the scrapbook. Hoch's photomontages exploit to the fullest the disjointive quality of the montage pro cedure, which they enjoin in the service of an allegorical operation. They gen erally consist of what is supposed to pass for one coherent image, yet is com posed of fragments that clearly do not belong together. For example, Deutsches Madchen (German Girl, 1930) promises the portrait of a wholesome young German woman, which turns out, however, to be a jarring composite of dispa rate elements (fig. 2). A case in point is the girl's hair, which is tightly knotted in a dark bun and turns out to be that of a Japanese woman. As Maud Lavin notes, Hoch's portrayal of German femininity appropriates the traditional hairstyle of a Japanese woman to signify "tradition," thus suggesting that the visual culture of 1920s Germany lacked a signifier for traditional feminin ity.22 The critical force of this operation lies in the disjointive power of alle gory, which allows for contextually attaching the signified "traditional German femininity" to the signifier "traditional Japanese woman's hairstyle" while fore grounding the artificiality of this move. Because allegory emphasizes the dif ference of the terms it unites, it pointedly depicts the evocation of traditional German womanhood as resting on a problematic exotic fantasy, one bound to seize signifiers and images from a different culture or era to compensate for what is lacking in one's own context. As this brief discussion indicates, Hoch's single-image photomontages engage an allegorical mode of signification that emphatically invests the col laged fragments with a meaning that does not inhere in them, thereby fore grounding the constructedness and incongruity of the whole composition. By contrast, her scrapbook arranges single photographs in grids of various formats. Though cropping and overlaps are conspicuous at times, the single photographs are generally allowed to stand alone and demand to be read as self-contained units of a narrative series, thus discouraging an allegorical interpretation.23 Because virtually all of the images suggest a positive reading of their subjects, which are often lionized by foregrounding their aesthetically flattering aspects or endearing sentimentality, critics have tended to read the pictures as a dead pan celebration of Weimar's dazzling visual culture. Indeed, the book looks 22. Lavin, Cut with the Kitchen Knife, 123. 23. This impression is reinforced by Hoch's care in covering up the magazine's pages. As John son notes, except for a handful of cases Hoch pasted white paper in the interstices between images, thus creating self-effacing frames ('"On the Strength of My Imagination,'" 112).</page><page sequence="18">Figure 2.

These are thematically arranged in convenient grid layouts occasionally com plicated by small irregularities but otherwise suggest a linear reading of the double-page spreads from left to right and top to bottom. At closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that the neat grid layout is only a superficial means of orientation laid on an intricate web of analogical references that tie images together at various levels: single page, double-page spread, and across several pages. It is the narrative power of this analogical network that the scrapbook harnesses and performatively comments on. This inquiry is not propelled by the demystifying critique that drives Hoch's allegorical photomontages. Instead, what is at stake is how visual meaning can be rhetorically produced through a montage procedure that ties photographs together into complex ana logical networks. Analogy, as defined by Barbara Stafford, denotes "the similarity that exists between two or more apparently dissimilar things." It constitutes an imaginative practice that relies on the evidence of sensory perception to weave "discordant particulars into a partial concordance."24 Stafford is adamant in emphasizing the visual quality of analogy, which she wants to reappraise as a mimetic process that valorizes the visible surface of things. According to her, the ability to recognize that something resembles something else depends in great measure on the incarnational nature of vision, which brings together similarities gleaned from manifold dissimilars in acts of "sympathetic thought" (VA, 10). Analogy thus indicates the ways in which humans as embodied beings make sense of an incarnated world by situating themselves firmly in its midst. It presupposes a participatory attitude—which is not the same as affir mative—that is key to orienting oneself in an "artifact-littered reality" (VA, 29). As Stafford concludes, the demonstrative, evidentiary practice of analogy exemplifies "the intuitive ways in which we think simply by visualizing" (VA, 61) and engenders discoveries that are foundational for further cognitive pro cesses. Stafford's explication of how humans use analogy to visually orient themselves in an artifact-littered world offers an important insight into the pedagogical, performative investigation of visual analogy at the heart of Hoch's exploration of photography in the scrapbook. I will draw on one exemplary page from the scrapbook to begin discussing the dynamic play it stages with visual analogy. The page at issue, toward the 24. Barbara Stafford, Visual Analogy: Consciousness as the Art of Connecting (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1999), 8,9. Hereafter cited as VA.</page><page sequence="20">188 Narrative Resemblance middle of the scrapbook, features three images connected by several visual allusions (fig. 3).25 The picture in the upper left corner depicts a flower's pistil photographed at extremely close range, which makes it look like a pillowy, alien plant. The image is flanked at the right-hand side by a photograph of the feet of an elegantly dressed couple taken from a skewed top-down angle. The imprints left by the woman's feet on the sandy terrain suggest that she is walk ing away from the man. A plant outside the field of vision casts its shadow between the two pairs of feet and recalls the flower's pistil at the right, whose rounded protuberances are also echoed by the woman's rounded footprints. These two images rest, as it were, on a large photograph of two pumas, which takes up the whole bottom half of the page. This is a frontal portrait of the animals that are dubbed "Jungverheiratete Pumas (Zoo Hannover)" (newly wed pumas, Hannover Zoo) by the only caption on the page. The pumas' heads form a diagonal line that traverses the image bottom-up and right to left and parallels the diagonals formed by the woman's footprints and the flower's pis til. Paraphrasing Moholy-Nagy, one could maintain that this assemblage of disparate images foregrounds unsuspected mutual relationships grounded in analogy. The parting human couple stands in ironic counterpoint to the newly wed pumas, whose anthropomorphizing portrayal invests their presumed union with the full force of matrimonial obligation. The flower at the top might then allude to a nuptial celebration, but everything on the page looks skewed, from the abstract depiction of the flower's stem to the equally abstract por trayal of the parting couple, of whom only the feet are visible, and on to the safe realism of the newly wed pumas, whose hammy portrait looks like a senti mental caricature when compared with the boldness of the two New Vision photographs with which it is associated. Through the complex analogical play of both visual and textual elements on this first page, several themes and strategies unfold. First, the juxtaposing of the three images highlights the redundancy of the caption to the pumas' portrait. The caption states the obvious—the animals look like mates—but precisely this redundancy forms the caption's revealing trait, in that it calls attention to the fact that the pumas resemble a married couple because their photo recalls the conventions of the newlywed portrait. In other words, the 25.

The only exception is the page at issue here, which in the Album erroneously appears as page 1, whereas it figures on page 60 in the original. The facing page (59 in the original) also appears out of sequence on page 2 of the facsimile Album. Both misattributions occurred during production; the facsimile Album is otherwise a faithful reproduction of the original.</page><page sequence="21">Figure 3. Hannah Hoch, Album, opening page.

Second, the eye-level portrait of the pumas derives its force from the intensity of the animals' gazes. This point is underscored in the juxtaposition with the faceless photograph of the human couple. Both pumas face the cam era, although the larger one looks upward past the camera and to the side, while the other engages the camera—and by implication the viewer—directly. The viewer's gaze thus has at least two paths for roaming the page: one involves following the upward movement of the puma at left; the other entails return ing the smaller puma's gaze in an act that thematizes the relationality of see ing and vision. In a similar way, the movement and direction of individuals', animals', and even dolls' eyes is a preeminent feature of many double-page spreads, often offering analogical trails along which the viewer's own gaze is invited to bounce in contravention to the linear order of the grid. In keeping with Stafford, one could say that this emphasis on the gaze highlights how vision is a privileged instrument of analogical discovery. Finally, the analogical juxtaposing of the human couple and the pumas has a dereferentializing effect that is crucial for the scrapbook. It is as though the indexical, iconic, and symbolic levels, which one can still piece together in purveying the individual images, had come unglued as a result of the images' assemblage on the page. For instance, the pumas' humanizing characterization, which the caption emphasizes, accentuates the depersonalizing presentation of the human couple, of whom only the feet are shown. The combination of the two images raises the question of what kind of relationship the pumas might actually have, a question one is bound to ask of the human couple as well. In other words, the associations one might initially marshal to decode the individual images are suspended or placed into question by the images' montage on the page. As the automatized steps of identification and interpre tation seem to run aground, what is left is the images' indexical presentness. That is, the montage procedure divests the individual images of their conven 26. The scrapbook contains several animal depictions captioned by statements that emphasize the anthropomorphic nature of the portrayal: see, e.g., the "eccentric," "phlegmatic" frog on page 6.</page><page sequence="23">Patrizia McBride 191 Figure 4.

Reproduction, including downloading of Hoch works, is prohibited by copyright laws and international conventions without the express written permission of the Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York tional status as "optical signs" and turns them into blank signs, while open ing up their indexical blankness to the play of visual analogy. Hoch's mon tage strategy thus achieves two objectives. It unmoors the individual images from the iconic and symbolic moments in which they have become entangled, and it also invites new symbolic operations, this time as a commentary on and an inquiry into the mechanisms of seeing. This is emblematically illustrated by a double-page spread that fea tures images of African women analogically tied by the theme of progres sion from childhood to adulthood and motherhood (fig. 4) {Album, 20-21). This narrative is complicated by the photograph of a young European woman in an artistic nude pose, which does not seem to fit the "passage-to-adult hood" theme yet appears connected to the other images by a different set of analogical assonances. Her photograph occupies the bottom-left corner of the left page, which includes two identical portraits of an African girl at the top identified as "Fulbe Madchen" (Fulbe girl) by the caption. The bottom right corner has a head-and-shoulder portrait of an African girl looking away</page><page sequence="24">192 Narrative Resemblance from the camera. The doubling of the Fulbe girl at the top suggests that the two images at the bottom—the naked European woman and the African girl in profile—can also be read as doubles. An equivalence is thus established between the demure African girl, whose shoulders are exposed, and the European woman, who smiles into the camera while chastely draping a cloth across her womb. The latter photograph's soft focus and stylized ornamental background, as well as the girl's staged pose, level an artistic claim that tem pers the potential offense of her nudity, her bare breasts both recalling and forming a contrast to the exposed breasts of an African woman shown while chatting with other men and women in a photograph on the adjacent page. The images of female nudity on this two-page spread document how Weimar visual culture negotiated the taboo of nudity and the perils of the pornographic by investing the nude body with connotations of beauty, natu ralness, and innocence. Hoch's scrapbook contains an extensive repertoire of such images, which range from naked children and adults exercising in the outdoors to non-Western peoples captured in their "natural" way of life and images that recall the centuries-old tradition of the female nude portrait. In all cases, the sensuality of the naked—primarily female—body is transfig ured and sublimated in an aesthetic operation designed to foreground the body's innocence and intrinsic beauty. Yet on this spread the juxtaposition of the naked bodies of the European girl and the seated African woman at the top of the right-hand page is jarring. The latter is talking while sitting in a slouched position, her elongated breasts draped across her belly, the ordinary quality of her demeanor preventing aestheticization or idealization. This makes the European woman's pose seem all the more contrived, casting doubt on the pretense of artistry and innocence that authorizes it. It compels the reader to inspect more closely the narrative suggested by the progression from the virtuousness of girlhood to the experience of motherhood in the last picture of a Somali woman holding a young child. Are the moments of inno cence one can glean from these depictions constitutive of the lives of these African women, or are they constructed through the conventions of the pho tographic medium, as is the case for the European woman in the nude? Does the narrative of untainted girlhood and motherhood apply to these African women at all, or is it a Western fantasy determined to find in the exotic and the primitive what it has presumably lost at home? Another double-page spread raises similar questions by exploring the themes of movement, dance, and sports (fig. 5) (Album, 18-19). It features a sequence of eight photos that starts at the top left-hand corner with an image of the popular dancer Gret Palucca captured in an athletic jump and ends with an</page><page sequence="25">Patrizia McBride 193 Figure 5.

The visual assonance of the two women's crouching position bookends, in sequential order, the image of a man pole-vaulting, another shot of Palucca engaged in a sideway leap, an image of the dancer Vera Skoronel in a statuary pose,27 two images of a young Balinese girl in ceremonial costume executing a trance dance,28 and a photo of two sumo wrestlers in a hold position—this latter image is captioned "Sumo: Beinstellen ist erlaubt und eine ganze Reihe von Griffen, welche bei unserem Ringkampf streng verpont sind" (Sumo: tripping and a whole array of moves that are censured in our wrestling are allowed here) (Album, 19). The sequence is harnessed by a web of analogical references that 27. The image bears the caption "Starke Geste im modernen Ausdruckstanz (Die Wigman schiilerin Vera Skoronel) Phot. Suse Byk" (Strong gesture in the modern expressive dance [the Wigman student Vera Skoronel] Phot. Suse Byk). Palucca was a student of the acclaimed dancer Mary Wigman. 28. The photo of the Bali child dancer is used two other times in the scrapbook (Album, 29,34) in contexts that highlight other aspects of the image, thus engendering different kinds of associations.</page><page sequence="26">194 Narrative Resemblance link the visual and the conceptual in far-reaching associations. The leap of the pole vaulter resonates directly with the athletic jumps of the female dancers. In addition, Skoronel's concentrated expression echoes the stupor of the Balinese dancer at right. The dancers' and athlete's physical prowess on the left page finds an incongruous resonance in the wrestlers' heavy-set bodies on the fac ing page. Their athletic embrace whimsically recalls ballroom dancing but also resembles Baker's coquette dancing squat at right. Her sexually inviting expres sion and skimpy exotic costume in turn form a counterpoint to the men's par tial nudity, which appears far less appealing by the aesthetic standards implied by her portrayal. On the whole, the analogical relationships created by the images illu minate the ties between sports and dance while also foregrounding the spe cific cultural and normative horizons that regulate them, as alluded to by the caption's reference to the distinctive rules of sumo wrestling. This in turn raises the issue of how one is to sort out the allusions to aestheticized bodily prowess, religious enrapture, exoticism, and sexuality found in the images. To what extent is sumo wrestling a dance? To what extent is modern dance a kind of wrestling? What is one to make of the fact that the focused expres sion of one wrestler recalls that of the Balinese child dancer? Is modern dance analogous to the child's ritualized movements? If so, what kind of religiosity is implied in both? And what is its relationship to the sexualized body celebrated by mass culture? While it might be possible to answer these questions so as to recon struct, by means of conjecture, the commentary Hoch intended to provide on these issues, what interests me more is that the questions are raised at all via an analogical procedure that exposes often surprising ties among images. The consistency of this operation makes the scrapbook's last image, a pan oramic view of Berlin's iconic Potsdamer Platz spread across two pages, all the more striking (fig. 6). When compared with the dizzying mosaic of images the viewer has been asked to make sense of, the oversized single photograph of Berlin's most bustling square looks disarming and almost cozy despite the monumental scale of the environment it encompasses. The conventions of the panoramic photograph endow it with a sense of surveyable place and famil iar modernity that binds together and embeds the various experiences offered in the scrapbook. In wrapping up its journey through all manner of defamil iarizing perspectives and visual experiences, Hoch's scrapbook seems to end by visually producing the very context that encompasses the modern medley of visual stimuli. But the image's disarming simplicity fails to fully convince</page><page sequence="27">Patrizia McBride 195 Figure 6. Hannah Hoch, Album, closing page. ARS/Berlinische Galerie, Berlin. Reproduction, including downloading of Hoch works, is prohibited by copyright laws and international conventions without the express written permission of the Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York after the hermeneutic acrobatics imposed by the montage narratives of the preceding pages. At the very least, the montage of images has chipped away at the mystique of the straight photograph, with the result that the viewer can no longer take at face value its instantaneousness and putative self-containment. In other words, the paradoxical sense of quotidian familiarity and anonymous metropolitan life conjured by the photograph becomes a riddle that requires an active work of decoding. The mode of this decoding forms the very crux of Hoch's scrapbook, as foregrounded by the placing of this photograph at its very end. It is the only image that occupies an entire double-page spread and is thus allowed to stand alone in the field of vision delimited by the book. It is as though the viewer were now invited to test the viewing skills honed while negotiating the scrapbook's visual medley on an image presented more conventionally. Indeed, the conventional reception of this photograph would involve an act of identification or recognition of what the image depicts, an act that requires</page><page sequence="28">196 Narrative Resemblance matching the depicted with a referent based on resemblance.29 This is, at bot tom, the likeness test flunked by Kracauer's youthful grandmother. After experiencing the montage of images presented in the scrapbook, however, the viewer is less likely to ask a conventional question such as "What object or place in real life does this image resemble?" than to puzzle over what other images the photograph possibly recalls, how it overlaps analogically with other sites (and sights), and what this visual overlap might say about the depicted referents. In other words, resemblance in Hoch's scrapbook is no longer about the mimetic relation between an image and a referent. In heed ing, as it were, the cautionary discourse of Kracauer, Benjamin, and Brecht, the book no longer enjoins resemblance to illusionism and verisimilitude as warrants for the truthfulness of the photographic image, but turns it into a medium for multiple analogical comparisons among ostensibly unrelated images. These are, to paraphrase Benjamin, operations of mutual captioning that cast a new light on the relations among the depicted referents, allowing for the active construction of narratives that lay claim to truth. My analysis of Hoch's scrapbook as an example of the modernist photo book has focused on the pedagogy it unfolds through its exploration of visual analogy. This pedagogical moment is consigned not to theoretical statements but to a performative investigation of photography's narrative and rhetorical power. This investigation initially deploys montage to uncouple the diverse semiotic layers that mediate reception of a given photograph. The montage procedure strips photographs down to their indexical status, exposing the indifferent spatial continuum of their visible surface. This is not to be taken as an early statement about a reality in which the possibility of truth has been supplanted by an endless play of simulacra. Hoch's scrapbook instead valorizes images by taking seriously their indexical moment, the fact that they refer back to an instant in time that grounds their authenticity. At the same time, it makes clear that this instant is semiotically blank because the context that frames it cannot be supplied by the photograph itself. The pedagogical moment lies in practicing attribution of iconic and symbolic information out side automatized routines, in asking how much images can "say" if one exer cises vision's capacity for establishing analogical connections. 29. The caption under the photograph's lower right corner, "Der Potsdamer Platz, Berlin vom Dach des neuen Columbus Hochhauses gesehen" (Berlin's Potsdamer Platz. Viewed from the roof of the new Columbus House), readily discloses the identity of the displayed site and spares the reader any guesswork.</page><page sequence="29">Patrizia McBride 197 After the first couple of pages the viewer becomes used to the double valence of each photograph, which is allowed both to stand alone as a self contained indexical statement and to enter into relationships with other pho tographs and textual material. These relationships are based on thematic and formal resemblances that suggest multiple possible accounts, but connecting the dots ultimately falls to the viewer. In these operations the familiar and the exotic, the proximate and the distant, the natural and the civilized, the ani mate and the inanimate are mixed up in analogical networks that complicate their antonymic relations without altogether undoing them. As the montage procedure turns something into its opposite—the familiar becomes exotic, the animal human, the human inanimate, and so on—the point is not to destroy distinctions per se but to show how they are not inherent properties of objects but heuristic tools of perception whose deployment depends on contextual ization. What the assembled photographs withhold from the viewer in terms of critique or affirmation underscores the open-endedness and empowering moment of the montage procedure, which mimics how seeing analogically pieces together elements of the real. The debates about photography I described at the start of this essay ulti mately boiled down to the question of how one is to orient oneself in a world saturated by mechanically reproducible images. What is one to do with those images that purport objectively to present a state of affairs for which we have no context? And what about those images that, under the pretense of mediating knowledge of the strange and the exotic, only reflect back to us our biases and uninspected beliefs, so that the image's ostensive moment of discovery and recognition winds up thickening the blinders that occlude our vision? Hoch's scrapbook twists the terms of the debate by turning the issue of truth—as pre sumably vouchsafed by a photograph's exactitude and objectivity—into an investigation of resemblance. The photograph's potential for truth, then, hinges on the multiple analogical relations it can enter into with other information, whether visual or verbal. At issue are not the disjointive analogies of surreal ism, which aimed to transfigure the degraded experience of modernity through acts of immanent transcendence. In Hoch's scrapbook there is no transfigu ration, let alone transcendence, but rather acts of discernment, guided by the question of what else I can see if I reshuffle the conventional orders in which images appear. In a world where meaningful seeing is often coterminous with recognizing, and where recognition is sustained by media images whose end less resemblance creates the impression that we actually know what we recog nize, the task the scrapbook undertakes involves turning resemblance, the end less mirroring of images in the media, into a tool for active seeing.</page></plain_text>
