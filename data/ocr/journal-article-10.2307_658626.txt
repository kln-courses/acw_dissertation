TORONTO MEETING OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION.--The thirty- eighth meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at Toronto, proved to be an exceptionally interesting one from every point of view. The number of papers presented was large, and in point of scientific value and interest compare favor- ably with any previous year. Canadians are proverbially hospitable, and their arrangements for the convenience of the meeting and for the comfort and social pleasure of their visitors left nothing to be desired. If, as many believe, the chief value of the annual meeting of the Association be the advantages of social intercourse and of personal contact of working scientists, then the meeting at Toronto ranks second to none in the advantages enjoyed. As in past years, the proceedings of Section H, Anthropology, in which our readers are chiefly interested, excited much attention and drew large and appreciative audiences, and a considerably larger number of papers were read in it than in any other section. The papers covered a wide range of subjects and were so numerous that, notwithstanding the fact that comparatively little time was de- voted to discussion, it was with difficulty that all were read, though every moment of the allotted time was occupied. Want of space forbids a characterization of the many excellent anthropologic papers, but an attempt may be made to briefly set forth the salient features of the two formal addresses respectively of the retiring President of the Association, Major J. W. Powell, and the Vice-President and Chairman of Section H, Col. Garrick Mallery. Major Powell chose for his adaress the extremely interesting and important subject, Evolution of Music. At the outset the distinction was made between biotic evolution and human evolution, the one being progress in bodily functions and the other progress in culture. To the latter class belonged the subject of which he was treating. Man as a musician had not de- veloped by the survival of the fittest. There had been no natural system of laws by which the bad musician had been killed and the good musician permitted to live and propagate his kind. The laws of evolution, however, were transferred from man to music itself.</page><page sequence="2">Oct. 1889.] NOTES AND NEWS. 371 The songs of barbarism were lost in civilization, and modem music was replacing the music of our fathers. So the old grew into the new by the survival of the fittest; not by natural selection, but by human selection, for men keep the music they love the best. Music was the invention of mankind; not of one man, but of all men, of composers, performers, and hearers. It had come down the stream of time, and as the rivers grow from source to sea, so music grows from primal time to vast eternity. The groWth of music is seen in four stages: Music as rhythm, music as melody, music as harmony, and music as symphony. Rhythm was born of the dance, melody was born of poetry, harmony was born of drama, symphony was born of science. The motive of rhythmic music is biotic exalta- tation; the motive of melody is social exaltation; the motive of harmony is religious exaltation; the motive of symphony is aesthetic exaltation. Music is thus seen to have developed from the emo- tional nature of man, as philosophy had its spring in the intellectual nature. The earliest emotions arose from the biotic constitution- simple bodily pleasure or pain, and expressed in rhythm. The feel- ings were idealized and became emotions and were expressed in melody; then the emotions were idealized and became sentiments, and were expressed in harmony; then the sentiments were idealized and became intellectual conceptions of the beautiful, the true, and the good, and these were expressed in symphony. Was there a new music for the future ? The science of music answered, "Yes." Music had been chained to " form " and imprisoned in the bastile of musical intervals and guarded by the henchmen of mathematical dogmas. But a few great musical composers, like Wagner, had broken the chains and burst the bars and niastered the jailers, and they sang their liberty in strains of transcendent music. To cultivate skill in musical performance it was necessary to cultivate the art in the in- dividual in the same order in which it was cultivated in the race; and he must first master rhythm, then melody, then harmony, then symphony. Even the love for music must be acquired in the same order. No one could love a symphony or an opera who did not first love song. If you would love the higher music, you must love the songs of the people; and to affirm that you love a symphony or an opera or a cantata, but that you do not love a song, was like averring that you love a garden but do not love a rose; that you love a bouquet but do not care for a lily; for a symphony was but a bouquet of melodies, and an opera a garden of many flowers.</page><page sequence="3">372 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST. [Vol. II. Happy was the home that was filled with song, where boys and girls sang the melodies of the people, and where they made these melo- dies more musical with the violin, the piano, or the flute; for to music was consigned the purest joy. The title of the address by Col. Garrick Mallery, Vice-President, was "Israelite and Indian: A Parallel in Planes of Culture." He noticed the theory, long advocated and still surviving, that the North American Indians were descendants of the " Lost Ten Tribes of Israel," and admitted that an astounding number of customs of the Indians are the same as those of the ancient Israelites; but the lesson drawn by him from the parallel is in effect that men in the same plane of culture act and think alike, with differences chiefly arising from their respective environments. The special theory is destroyed by the now accepted fact that the Ten Tribes were not lost, but that most of the people were deported and absorbed, leav- ing traces for centuries, and others fled as individuals to known lo- calities. In the parallel the Israelites were mainly considered in the times before they had formed a nationality and become sedentary. Nearly contemporaneous with their nationality was the general use of writing, about the era of David. The Indians did not reach the stage of nationality, seldom were truly sedentary, and did not ac- quire a written language; so their stage of culture was similar. In their explanation of phenomena all the peoples of the world have resorted to revelations. Every myth and religion based on or explained by a myth was supposed to come directly or indirectly through revelation, but as the revelation is on both sides of the equa- tion it can be eliminated from any scientific parallel regarding re- ligious opinions and practices. In anthropology the object is to study within the category of humanity. The suggestion of revelation therefore acts as a cl6ture, cutting off all discussion. Colonel Mallery reasserted his statement published twelve years ago, that no tribe of Indians before missionary influence had any formulated or distinct belief in a single overruling " Great Spirit " or any being corresponding to the later Israelite or the Christian conception of God. All statements of the missionaries or early travelers to the opposite effect are erroneous. He gave a careful summary of the opinions of the Israelites at the corresponding times of their history as to the belief in question. The conclusion</page><page sequence="4">Oct. 1889.] NOTES AND NEWS. 373 was that not both but that neither of the peoples held it, that being the true parallel on that subject. Both had many gods of good and of evil and of great or little power. All phenomena were their work, but not the work of one. Man was surrounded by myriads of beings who would be supernatural if nature had laws. Each of these could and was expected to do anything whatever in accordance with his arbitrary will, only limited by the opposition of a stronger daimon or body of daimons. Men who were inspired or empowered by the supernatural were also expected, in fact required, to work wonders. It would not be a paradox to say that the supernatural was alone natural, and that in the explanation of phenomena only the irregular was regular. The most advanced of the Indian tribes showed evidence of transition from zo6theism to physitheism, and the Israelites at the latter part of the period selected showed the same transition in a somewhat higher degree. Neither worshiped idols in human form because their religion had not become anthropomorphic. The tutelar gods, the special cult of tribes, clans, and individuals, were connected with zo6theism and also with the totemic system, and they were conspicuous both among the Israelites and the Indians. As regards opinions upon a future state after death, both peoples believed in a return of the spirit to a home of the an- cestors, with the difference that the Indians had an idea of a " Happy Hunting Ground," in which without trouble or distress they did the same that they do in this world; but the Israelites had in their Sheol a more gloomy view. In one respect they agreed--all the spirits went to the same place, with exceptions chiefly made by the special circumstances of death and of funeral rites, which were dwelt upon. There was no future state of rewards and punishments. Their religious practices were closely connected with their earlier sociology, and were strikingly similar. Comparison between the two peoples was made of the priesthood or regular shamans, the independent sorcerers or prophets, rain- makers, mystery-men, sanctuaries, witches, oracles by dreams and divination, sacrifices and incense, fetiches, fasts, dances, and other orgiastic proceedings. The parallel often urged in connection with pollution and purifi- cation was explained on the principles lately expressed by the Poly- nesian word " tabu." The origin of the institution of the Sabbath in connection with the feast of the new moon, with subsequent his-</page><page sequence="5">374 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST. [Vol. II. toric changes, was mentioned, and also the fact that circumcision, regarded as a distinctive mark of the Israelites, was by no means peculiar to them, being found in many parts of the world, including several of the Indian tribes. Myths and legends of the Indians parallel to those recorded in the Old Testament were given as illustrations of their religious opin- ions and practices. The sociology of the two peoples shows that the totemic or clan system, only lately understood among the Indians, explains what has been mystical about the tribes of Israel. The salient features of the totemic system, consisting of the division of the people into tribes interpermeated by clans, with special rules of government, adoption, protection, punishment, property, descent, and marriage, were sev- erally described and comparisons made. The forbidding of articles of food, hygienically good, was explained on the totemic principle, in which originally no part of the animal which was the clan totem could be eaten otherwise than sacramentally. The popular idea that the Israelites were a " peculiar " people, or that the Indians are such, was denied. There is racially no " peculiar" people in the sense intended. Mankind is homogeneous in nature, though placed in differing and ever-advancing grades of culture. Now that all attempts at a classification of races have failed, the most useful mode for an examination of peoples by anthropologists is not by attempts at racial divisions, but by the determination of the several planes of culture with the recognition of specific environ- ments.

When we compare the customs of the several tribes we are led to ask several questions: I. Have not certain gentes shifted their camping areas? 2. Has there been consolida- tion of gentes or sub-gentes? 3. Has there been segregation or differentiation of gentes or sub-gentes ? 4. Are there any instances of emigration from one tribe to another of a common stock? 5- Has a new gens been formed by the adoption of foreigners (i. e., those of another linguistic stock) into the tribe ? I. Dakota tribes.-The writer has been unable to find animal names for Dakota gentes. Their names point either to a former habitat or else to some custom or event in their past history. If all the Dakotas ("The Seven Council-fires") ever camped in a com- mon circle, there is a strong probability that four gentes (Spirit Lake village, Leaf village, Warpeton, and Sisseton) occupied one</page><page sequence="7">376 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST. [Vol. 11. side of the circle, and three gentes (Yankton, Yanktonnais, and Teton) pitched their tents on the other. A study of the dialects of the Dakota points to this; and we have a recent statement made by Dakotas to Miss Fletcher that their people used to camp in two sets of concentric circles--one of four circles; the other of three. The first area in the circle of the Spirit Lake village is that of the Kiyuksa, or Breakers ofthe custom, so called because they disregard the law of marriage outside the gens; but in the Upper Yanktonnais (a half- tribe) the Kiyuksa have the fifth place; among the Oglala they have the third place, according to one authority; and they are part of the seventh Brule or Sichanghu gens. The Kap'ozha, "Unincum- bered with much baggage," are the third gens of the Spirit Lake village and the sixth of the Sisseton when the latter camp alone as a tribe. When the Sisseton and Warpeton camp together the Kap'ozha shift their area to the other side of the circle, becoming the eleventh gens in order. The Oyate shi-cha, or Bad Nation, have the sixth place in the circle of the Spirit Lake village and the seventh in that of the Yankton. The Chan-ku-te, Shooters at or among trees, form the first gens of the Yankton and the fourth of the Sisseton. The Ti zaptan, or Five Lodges, have the first place in the Siha-sapa or Black-feet (Teton) circle, the fifth place in the Sisseton circle; but they occupy the twelfth area when the Sisseton and Warpeton have one circle in common. The Wa-che-un-pa, or Roasters, constitute the fifth gens of the Yankton, the eighth or ninth (?) of the Si-chan- ghu, and the fifteenth (?) of the Oglala-(authorities differ; hence I am not positive as to their exact areas). The Shi-kshi-che-la (Bad ones of different kinds) are the third gens of the Upper Yanktonnais, the sixth of the Itazipcho, the seventh of the Minikoozhu, and the seventh of the Hunkpapa. The Wazhazha have the fifth area in the circle of the Siha-sapa, and the fifteenth in that (the recent one) of the Si-chan-ghu. The Wakan are the eleventh gens of the Oglala and the eighth of the Hunkpapa: The Tiyochesli have the fourteenth area in the Si-chan-ghu circle, and the seventeenth in that of the Oglala. The Wa-glu-khe, In-breeders, are said to be the ninth Sichanghu gens. One authority makes them the seventh gens of the Oglala; another, four years later (1884), makes them the eighteenth and nineteenth gentes of the latter tribe. One authority gave the Ite shi-cha, or Bad Faces, as the first or fifth Oglala gens; another said that this name belongs to the second sub-gens of the twelfth gens as</page><page sequence="8">Oct. 1889.] NOTES AND NEWS. 377 well as to the thirteenth gens of the Oglala. The Wa-kmu-ha o-in, the name of the third Yankton gens, corresponds to the Wa-mnu- gha o-in, the sixth Siha-sapa gens. Segregation.-Six of the original Dakota gentes have developed into tribes, each with its respective gentes. One, the Yankton- nais, is in two half-tribes, each having its own gentes. The seventh original gens, the Teton, developed into seven gentes: Si-chan-ghu, Itazipcho, Ohe-nonpa, Minikoozhu, Siha-sapa, Oglala, and Hunk- papa. Each of these, in turn, now has its gentes, and some of the latter are divided into sub-gentes. It is said that the Hohe or Asin- niboin tribe was originally part of a Yanktonnais gens. In 188o the writer was told by Tetons visiting Washington that the Sichanghu were then in thirteen gentes, two of which could be traced to a foreign origin. In 1884 Rev. Luke C. Walker, a Dakota, stated to him that the Sichanghu were then in eleven gentes; but in the same year Rev. W. J. Cleveland furnished the writer with the names of eighteen divisions, though he said that some of them were of recent origin (by segregation). Emigration or adoption.-Mr. Cleveland gave Ohe-nonpa (the name of a Teton gens) as the seventeenth Sichanghu gens. Was there a change from a secondary to a tertiary place brought about by emigration ? In I88o a Teton told the writer that the tenth Sichanghu gens, called Sha-wa'-la or Shawnee, was composed of the descendants of former Shawnee captives. In 1884 Rev. Mr. Cleveland stated that the tenth Sichanghu gens was named I-san'-ya-ti or Santee, point- ing to an emigration from the Isanyati or Spirit Lake village of the Dakotas. In I88o the writer was told by some of the Tetons that the eleventh Sichanghu gens was named I-hank'-ton-wan', or Yank- ton, pointing to the emigration or adoption of members of the Yank- ton Dakota tribe-(originally the " End Village "). II. Dhe!-gi-ha, etc.-The names of gentes in this division of the Siouan family are of the following classes: Animal names, taboo names, archaic names (some of which may be called cryptic names, as Ponka, Osage, Kansa, Dha-ta-da, Hanga, Ishtasanda, and Chi"- zhu). Shifting of areas.-Taking the Omaha circle as the temporary standard, we find the Elk (Thunder) and Kansa (Wind) gentes occupying the extreme areas on one side, and the Earth-lodge makers (Wolf) and Ishtasanda (Thunder and Reptile) holding simi- 48</page><page sequence="9">378 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST. (Vol. II. lar areas on the other. Among the Omaha the Elk people lead in the worship of the thunder. In the Kansa tribe the Elk people were originally part of the Earth gens.

In the Ponka circle, the Dhi-ghi-da, holding the second place, is the war gens. Its place is on the right, though it is a Chi"zhu gens. (In the Osage tribe all the Tsishu gentes are on the left or peace side.) Archaic or crypt'c names.-Ponka, Kansa, Osage, Hanga, etc. In the Omaha circle the Hanga and Kansa gentes camp on the right. In the Ponka circle, the Ma-kan (or Ponka) gens camps on the right and the Wazahe (or Osage) on the left. This last is a Snake gens. In the Kansa circle, the Wazahe (a deer gens), Kan- sa (a wind gens), and Ponka (red cedar gens?) camp on the right, and the two Hanga gentes on the left. In the Osage circle, seven Washashe or Osage gentes, including one Ponka gens, camp on the right, as do seven Hanka gentes, one of which is the Kansa or Wind gens. Consolidation.--In the Omaha tribe, four sub-gentes of the Ifike- sabe are reckoned as three; four of the Hanga as two; four of the Earth-lodge makers as two, and four of the Ishtasanda as three. Among the Osage, seven Washashe "fire-places" or "1council- fires " are reckoned as two, and the seven Hanka gentes as five, thus preserving the original number, seven. In the Kansa and Oto tribes the Bear and Wolf people are considered as one gens. Segregation.-In the Ponka tribe, the Ma-kan and Wa-sha-be gentes were originally one. The same can be said of the Elk and Earth gentes of the Kansa tribe. Each Iowa gens was divided into four sub-gentes. There is reason to suspect that in former days such was the rule among the Omaha. This four-fold division is still found in the Cheghita or Bird gens of the Missouri tribe and the Bird gens of the Winnebago. Emigration and adoption.-There are no more Beaver people among the Iowa, because their Pa'-khtha people joined the Pa-tha' gens of the Oto. The Mo'-mi (a people who abstain from small birds) joined the Wakanta, a Thunder or Bird gens of the Missouri tribe, being now reckoned as the fourth sub-gens. Their origin is unknown. Another question is suggested by a fresh perusal of this paper: When we find a name common to two or more tribes, what expla- nation of its origin shall be given? For instance, did the name Shikshichela originate in one gens, its presence in another being due to emigration? Or did the name have an independent origin in each tribe ? J. OWEN DORSEY.</page><page sequence="11">380 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST. [Vol. II. COLLECTION OF HONEY DEW BY THE NEVADA INDIANS.--Indians are exceedingly fond of sugar, and, as an instance of the pains they took to gather substances of a like character before the sugar of the white man was brought within their reach, the following may be of irterest: Whilst traveling through the State of Nevada, some ten or twelve years ago, my attention was attracted to numbers of Indians, prin- cipally squaws and children, camped along the borders of Honey Lake. The shores of this lake were bordered by large beds of tules or rushes growing in the shallows. I was told that the Indians came to the lake every year to gather honey dew, and never having heard of this before I made a hurried investigation and found the tules when freshly gathered to be sparsely covered with small, clear, bright points or drops of a sticky and very sweet liquid resembling honey in both taste and consistency. The drops in some instances were a little larger than a pin's head, but as a rule were very minute. This, I was told, was the "honey dew," and it was to gather this that the Indians were there collecting the tules. So far as I could observe, the mode of procuring the honey dew was as follows: Early in the morning the squaws and children cut the tules and brought them to the shore in armfuls. They were then spread upon blankets, pieces of old canvas or calico, and ex- posed to the sun. In time the small drops of "dew" crystallized by evaporation. When in the proper state the tules were beaten with willow wands from which the bark had been removed. This beating detached the particles of dew which fell on the cloth be- neath from which it was removed with great care. I do not remember to have seen upon any cloth a greater quantity than one or two ounces of this product, which was very sweet, with a marked and, upon the whole, disagreeable flavor to me, though it seemed to be highly valued by the Indians. Indeed, their arduous labors for such slight returns were an evidence of this. I was informed by the white men living near Honey Lake that the lake derived its name from this honey dew. Whether the dew is the result of perforations in the stalks, produced by insects, or is a deposit made by some insect, I am unable to say. I do not know that any account of this Nevada honey dew or of this mode of collecting it has been published heretofore. If such accounts are extant this instance will help to confirm them. W. W. WITHERSPOON.</page></plain_text>
