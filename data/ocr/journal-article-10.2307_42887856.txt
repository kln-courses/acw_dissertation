This paper examines reasoning and rhetoric about economic recession in selected newspapers. This is an interesting topic for discourse analysis because it is a site of argumentation. We begin by asking: (1) epistemological questions (e.g. What evidential basis is drawn on in rhet- oric about recession?) and then (2) ontological questions (e.g. How is recession pictured? and How is recession coordinated with the social world?). We examine the management of evidence and definitions con- cerning whether or not there is a recession. We then examine the entities invoked, showing how (a) a range of metaphors depict the recession as either an uncontrollable agent or as a controllable thing; and (b) rhetori- cal strategies used by both critics and supporters of the government col- lude in picturing the economy as a realm abstracted from social life. key words: discourse analysis, economic discourse, economic rhetoric, newspapers, rhetoric INTRODUCTION Talk about the economy abstracts and purports to describe a vast array of social events. This paper examines some of the rhetoric afforded by and constitutive of economic discourse by focusing on newspaper stories about a particular phenomenon: economic recession. Economic phenomena are without doubt important in the reproduction of society and in social and political power relations, a conclusion reached by Marx some time ago. An external feature of Marx's critical analysis of political economy is that it is simultaneously an analysis of ideology. Marx, as a 'master of the school of suspicion' (along with Freud and Nietzsche), to use Ricoeur's (1977) phrase, sought to go beyond describing the surface of economic phenom- ena and to explain these appearances. Because his analysis seeks to explain discourse &amp; society © 1993 sage (London, Newbury Park and New Delhi), vol. 4(3): 329- 356.</page><page sequence="2">330 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY how it is that the mechanisms behind the appearances have gone unno- ticed, it is at the same time a critique of ideology. A specific and celebrated example is that of the fetishism of commodities . This concept denotes the process whereby commodities, though actually objects produced by human labour, appear to have an independent life of their own, whilst the humans who laboured to produce them are reduced to objects: ... the labour of the private individual manifests itself as an element of the total labour of society only through the relations which the act of exchange establishes between the products, and, through their mediation, between the producers. To the producers, therefore, the social relations between their private labours appear as what they are, i.e. they do not appear as direct social relations between persons in their work, but rather as material relations between persons and social relations between things . . . (Marx, 1867/1976: 165-6) Whilst the study of ideology has undergone a decisive linguistic/commu- nicative turn (Thompson, 1984), there has been little discursive analysis of the economic domain which was the focus of Marx's works, though there are limited exceptions which must be mentioned. McCloskey (1985) has examined the rhetoric of economic theory, though not the use of economic theory in public contexts. Economic arguments emerge in Antaki's (1985) study of causal arguments about political events. Verges (1987) has attempted to theorize societal cognitive resources for handling economic phenomena using the theory of social representations (Moscovici, 1983) and pays some attention to economic discourse. His analysis, however, is restricted to people's understanding of formal economic phenomena and does not deal with the rhetorical work to which economic discourse can be put nor with the ideological functions it fulfils. Pinch and Clark (1986) have studied economic reasoning in market transactions. Ashmore et al. 's (1989) analysis traces the transformation of medical and health categories into those of 'health economics'. Emmison's (1983) content analysis of newspapers and magazines found increased anthropomorphism and active metaphors associated with 'the economy' and related concepts since 1945. The Glasgow University Media Group's studies of bias in news reporting (e.g. Glasgow University Media Group, 1980) have included the reporting of certain economic issues. For example, they point out in regard to prac- tices of television news reporting that the problems of capital accumulation are presented in such a manner as to assume that they are everybody's problems. Economic issues have also entered into analyses provided by the work of the Centre of Contemporary Cultural Studies, University of Birm- ingham (e.g. Connell, 1980). We have chosen to examine discourse relating to the issue of economic recession because this is a focus of controversy. An economic recession relates to lack of economic growth. A widely used definition states that a country's economy is in a recession if there have been two successive quarters of negative growth. As such, a recession has implications for people's financial situations and there is some evidence that attributions of</page><page sequence="3">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 331 blame for economic events can have implications for how people vote (Petrocik and Steeper, 1986). Such a study takes economic recession as an independent variable and examines its effects. Other research, such as De Greene's (1988) analysis of 'macropsychological' factors, sees economic situations in a mutually causal relationship with other factors. Some research on economic recession has used content analysis (Zullow, 1991). (In fact, certain newspapers do exist in machine-readable format, a fact which we have made use of, as reported below.) The perceived consequentially of talk about the recession It is generally claimed in newspapers and periodicals that statements about the economy have the reflexive property of affecting the economy. For example, the Guardian's Education Guardian section, which is aimed at school students, carried an article on economic jargon which begins: The words used in economic arguments about whether or not there is a recession can actually affect the economy.' It goes on to say: 'Mrs Thatcher has complained of "voices of gloom", which talk of "an end to the UK economic miracle'" (Education Guardian , 9 October 1990: 2). More recently, The Economist , a weekly periodical, carried a short item on the frequency of stories in certain national newspapers mentioning the word recession. It reports a slight reduction in such stories in the second quarter of 1992, and, commenting on a weakness in the reliability of its data, it remarks of this reduction: Still, it may be no worse a guide to the real world than many fancier calculations, especially if you believe that press reports are partly respon- sible for spreading self-fulfilling gloom about the economy. So cheer up, better times may be ahead - provided papers continue to carry fewer articles (such as this one) on the R-word. ( The Economist , 11-17 July 1992: 39) Quantification rhetoric In a paper on quantification rhetoric, Potter et al. (1991) systematically attend to the use of numerical details and quantifiability in discourse about cancer. They note that little work has been done in this domain and divide analysis of quantification into three areas: (a) studies of mathematics as a social practice (e.g. ethnomethodological analysis of mathematics [Liv- ingston, 1986]), (b) studies of the transformation of phenomena into math- ematical forms (e.g. analysis of abstract and situated numerical reasoning [Lave, 1986]) and (c) the rhetorical interpretation of mathematical forms (e.g. analysis of market pitchers' sales procedures [Pinch and Clark, 1986]). We note that areas (a) and (b) include much more than quantifi- cation. In addition to scalar numerical properties, the domains examined</page><page sequence="4">332 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY typically involve additional formal procedures. The processes of formaliz- ation and abstraction which flow from adopting mathematical discourse, and their consequences, are examined in the case of cognitive science by Agre (1988). Our concerns are not so much to do with the role of numeri- cal information in argumentation, which is an epistemological matter, but with the formal entities invoked in economic rhetoric, which is an ontologi- cal concern. One site for economic rhetoric is newspapers, which are a convenient source of data. They are in the public domain and are easily available, as Potter and Wetherell (1987) have noted. This has also made newspapers a popular area for content analytical procedures. However, whilst these may have their place (e.g. enabling numerical comparisons to be drawn in cases where entities can be counted in a meaningful way) they notoriously fail to capture certain phenomena of interest, in particular the dynamics of argu- mentation (Billig, 1988). It is interesting to note that at several places in Capital , often in foot- notes, Marx draws on contemporary newspaper articles and letters to newspapers in the development of his critical analysis. For example, he draws on a newspaper report in The Times while making the point that capitalist institutions care for the health of workers only when forced to do so (Marx, 1867/1976: 381), and he cites a letter to The Times in discussing capitalists' perceptions of a worker as 'a condition of production which belong to him' (Marx, 1867/1976: 720-3). Epistemological and ontologica 1 orientations in discourse analysis Analyses of discourse may adopt an orientation which is primarily either epistemological or ontological. Zimmerman's (1974) study, for example, is epistemological in that it is primarily geared to participants' concerns with evidence . Analysts of discourse have also worked in an ontological mode insofar as they have attended to the entities invoked in discourse (Woolgar and Pawluch, 1985; Parker, 1992); in the words of Foucault (1972: 49), discourses are practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak'. For example, in his analysis of constructions of 'nature' in a public inquiry concerning a planning application for a landfill site, MacNaghten (in press) identifies and distinguishes discourses in terms of their ontology and the social relations which they imply. In examining rhetoric about economic recession and the economy, both these orientations are relevant. There is (a) the contested existence of recession, and evidence about it (which is an epistemological matter); and (b) the nature of recession and its relationship to other entities (which is an ontological matter). In order to examine economic discourse, this study analyses newspaper articles relating to economic recession. The analysis is organized into two parts reflecting the epistemological-ontological distinction. The first part of the analysis focuses on how evidence is used in disputes about whether</page><page sequence="5">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 333 or not there is a recession. The second part examines how the putative recession is constructed and the consequences of this. METHODS Data Our analysis is based on a corpus of articles selected from the Guardian and Financial Times newspapers during the final quarter (i.e. October, November and December) of 1990. We have taken this time period because this is likely to be the point at which the existence of a recession is most controversial. Negative growth had occurred in the third quarter. If it appears to participants that economic growth is going to be negative during the final quarter, then we may expect the existence of recession to be an arguable matter for them, given the availability of the definition of recession reported earlier. This is an eventful period in recent British history. During this period, Margaret Thatcher, the incumbent Prime Minister of 11 years, loses leadership of her party and thereby the premiership too. She is replaced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major (who continues to be Prime Minister after the 1992 general election). Norman Lamont becomes Chancellor of the Exchequer in Major's new cabinet. Also during this period the United Nations passes a resolution sanctioning the use of mili- tary force in the Persian Gulf. We do not attempt to offer an analysis of this period, and then to find correlates in discourse. However, readers may find the following gloss helpful (this gloss incidentally shows our position on this political period). We see the Thatcher administration as characterized by a dogmatic rather than pragmatic approach to politics. This is witnessed by the fact that a label, Thatcherism , appeared which was used to refer to the following related themes: an advocation of laissez-faire economics, in particular monetarism; the view that high unemployment was preferable to high inflation; a rhetoric championing individual responsibility and freedom; and 'popular capitalism'. (For a fuller account of the ideological positions adopted at this time see Hall and Jacques, 1983.) Sixty-two articles were taken from the Guardian and 73 from the Finan- cial Times. This is not an exhaustive collection. A search of the Financial Times Profile database showed that 460 articles in the Guardian contained the word recession (or other words having this as a stem (e.g. recessionary) and that 1348 such articles occur in the Financial Times. Most of the analysis presented here is restricted to the Guardian. Our choice of these newspapers is somewhat arbitrary. Whilst the present analysis does not rest on presuppositions about the political orientations of these papers, readers may find the following helpful: we take the Guardian to be a left-of-centre, liberal paper, and the Financial Times to be generally more central in its political outlook. We therefore anticipated that the Guardian would be comparatively critical of the government. Both papers are examples of</page><page sequence="6">334 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY 'broadsheets', which means that they have a rather limited readership, in contrast to 'tabloid' publications, which are more widely read. Analytical orientation Our approach does not claim to follow a specific methodology. It is based on repeated readings of material in our corpus and in that sense is data- driven. The approach may be placed in the area of discourse analysis (Potter and Wetherell, 1987; Parker, 1992). Undoubtedly the questions which we had in mind were conditioned by questions inherited from ethno- methodology and conversation analysis concerning the sense that the par- ticipants, who constructed or who are reported on in the material studied, found or aimed to create. Following Billig (1988), we are concerned less about method and more with the general matter of what questions can be asked of this discourse and what arguments made about it. The first part of the study is oriented to the use of evidence in arguments about whether or not there is a recession. In this part we will take a broadly chronological approach. For the second, ontological, part the analytic unit used is a discourse , which we take to be a set of statements which constructs objects in certain ways and positions those entities in certain relations. Our particular concern is with what phenomena economic discourse brings into being, whether they are passive or active and how they relate to each other. A key analytical resource of discourse analysis is the attention which it gives to variation in discourses. This typically involves examining contrasts within an individual's or group's discourse, or differences across groups. Such approaches may be viewed as synchronic since they focus on differ- ences at a given point in time. In contrast, both parts of our analysis partially involve diachronic variations (see also Billig, 1991: 149) because in both parts changes in the way the recession is reported over time are examined. ANALYSIS PART 1: ESTABLISHING A RECESSION Our analysis of the use of evidence is organized broadly chronologically. In the Guardian , stories anticipating an economic recession begin to appear midway through October. See, for example, Extracts 1 and 2. Extract 1 SHARES START TO SLIDE AS RECESSION FEARS MOUNT (1.1) Fears that Britain is on the road to recession once again put the London market into reverse. (1.2) Prices began the day pushing ahead following good sessions overnight on Wall Street and Tokyo. (1.3) But the early gains were quickly wiped out when news broke that UK industrial output fell by 0.5 per cent and that factory output dropped by a full percentage point in August. ( Guardian , 17 October 1990: 13)</page><page sequence="7">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 335 Extract 2 GROWTH IN EARNINGS 'RULES OUT CUT IN INTEREST RATES' (2.1) ... the City said the 10.25 per cent growth in earnings ruled out further cuts in base rates, increasing the prospect of recession. [. . .] (2.2) Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders released yesterday showed commercial vehicle production - à good indication of recessionary pressures - down by 14 per cent in the first nine months of 1990. ( Guardian , 19 October 1990: 20) Such stories show a concern with establishing, and explaining, the nature of the evidence. Extract 1 takes as its topic traders' perception of the economic situation. This article gives economic indicators and concludes from them that there are prospects of a recession. It is able to invoke the possibility of a recession in accounting for falls in stock exchange prices. The magnitude of the price fall, and thereby the seriousness of the 'news', is emphasized by contrasting it with a background of price rises (1.2). (See Pinch and Clark, 1986, for an analysis of the building of contrasts in market pitchers' sales routines.) This strategy also enables the dramatic assertion that the London market is 'in reverse'. Emphasis is further achieved through the description of the manner in which prices fell: it was fast and total; 'early gains were quickly wiped ouť (1.3; emphasis added). The grounds for the 'recession fears' are dramatically described: 'news broke'. And details of the news are provided. Note how the fall in factory output is described as 'a full percentage point' rather than 'one percent- age point'. Extract 2 directs us in interpreting the 14 per cent fall reported in (2.2); it is from a source which is 'a good indication of recessionary pressures'. In the Guardian one of the first statements that the British economy is in recession occurs on 24 October 1990. Extract 3 POLL OF 6,000 COMPANIES SHOWS NATIONWIDE GLOOM (3.1) The UK economy has plunged intoļ deep recession as highļ interest rates and a strong pound take their toll of output, exports, jobs and investment, according to a survey published yesterday. ( Guardian , 24 October 1990: 13) Again this piece shows a concern with evidential matters. We are told about 'a deep recession' and provided with the evidence for this, namely a recent survey. The survey is described as a 'poll', which connotes an exhaustive canvassing of opinion, and is across an impressively large number of companies. This evidence is also pithily interpreted for us with the gloss that the survey shows 'nationwide gloom'. Two days later a front-page story states that the 'Chancellor says eco- nomy may be in recession'.</page><page sequence="8">336 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY Extract 4 CHANCELLOR SAYS ECONOMY MAY BE IN RECESSION (4.1) The Chancellor yesterday acknowledged it was 'conceivable' that Britain's economy was in recession. (4.2) On a day marked by job losses, corporate collapses and a profits fall at Britain's biggest industrial combine [ICI], John Major told the [House of] Commons: (4.3) 'I can certainly confirm that output is slowing and has been slowing over the period of the last two to three months, as I have repeatedly said. (4.4) 'As to whether it is within the normal definition of recession, which is, of course, why my officials, and subsequently I, use that term, that is a matter we shall soon see.' (4.5) 'It is not entirely clear yet, it is conceivable it is, but we must wait and see.' (4.6) Last night, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, further reflected concern about the country's economic situation by warn- ing hard-pressed companies that there would be no immediate respite. (4.7) The fight against inflation would continue to dictate the level of interest rates, he said. (4.8) Membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism would bring pressure on companies to cut costs and improve productivity. (4.9) That would mean a continuation, in the short run, of difficult trading conditions. (4.10) His message came as ICI disclosed that profits had almost halved in the third quarter, receivers were appointed at Reliant Group, maker of the Robin three-wheeler, administrators began work at the Polly Peck group, and Philips said it Wanted to axe as many as 40,000 jobs worldwide, raising fears for up to 2,500 British employees. (4.11) At the same time, DAF, the Dutch truck maker which controls Leyland, said it planned to cut at least 430 jobs in Britain, and the submarine maker VSEL issued compulsory redundancy notices to 144 workers. (4.12) In a speech to the Equipment Leasing Association, Mr Leigh-Pemberton warned bankers they could not walk away from problems at debt-ridden companies. (4.13) 'Bankers who voluntarily take on a banking relationship in good times share some responsibility with the rest of the banking community to contribute to an orderly management of crisis,' he said. (4.14) Cautioning that companies should not be surprised if good-time lenders showed little grasp of a borrower's business during a downturn, he reminded bankers of the need for prudence, even when they were only one of a number of lenders. (4.15) In cases where banks were divided over a borrower which could not meet its obligations, the Bank of England would be prepared, in certain circum- stances, to act as a disinterested chairman of creditor groups, he said. (4.16) On the stock market, the FTSE 100 share index fell below 2,100, losing 21.8 points to 2088.7.

This is a key article in the narrative about the recession since it reports on the Chancel- lor of the Exchequer acknowledging just how bad the economic situation - in which he plays a part - actually is. Initially our analysis will focus on the topic indexed by the title, though as we shall see there is more to the article than this. The key part of the topic raised by the title is the quotation from Major in (4.4) and (4.5): (4.4) 4 As to whether it is within the normal definition of recession, which is, of course, why my officials, and subsequently I, use that term, that is a matter we shall soon see.' (4.5) 'It is not entirely clear yet, it is conceivable it is, but we must wait and see.' This is a particularly interesting piece of discourse because of three features: (a) the meaning of the term 'recession' is eroded by highlighting the issue of definition; this is connected with (b) the mentioning of officials; 'my officials' presents the image of a Chancellor working with a team of economic observers and has the effect of portraying the complexity of the economic situation; (c) finally there is the point, which is repeated, that we have to wait to see whether or not we are in a recession. The statement that 'it is conceivable it is', which is the newsworthy part of Major's talk, is postponed until after a rather cumbrous preface in (4.4). This preface states that we need to wait in order to find out whether the economy is in a recession and it interjects definitional considerations. What job is done by this? First, the meaning of the term 'recession' is made problematic by stating that an answer to the question 'are we in a recession?' depends on whatever definition we adopt. Major is saying: 'Look, if by a recession you mean two consecutive quarters of negative growth, then it's a simple matter of waiting and looking at the treasury statement for the current quarter when that comes out.' His allusion to 'my officials' is presumably made in order to justify the definition which he is adopting. His usage, he tells us, is subsequent to these officials' usage. It also has the effect of bringing into play an image of a Chancellor working with a team of economic observers. The reference to officials has two further effects: being in the plural, it portrays complexity of the economic processes - a whole team of people is required to observe them - and it also portrays declarations about these processes as technical, bureaucratic matters. The talk from Major closed with a three-part structure (4.5) (whether or not this is achieved by the writer[s] of the article or by Major is not known). Jefferson (1990) shows that three-part lists (in conversation) are treated by recipients as recognizably complete. Use of such a concluding format would certainly be consistent with the content of the last part of (4.5). The expression 'we must wait and see' means something rather different to 'we will find out'; it alludes to, and criticizes, perceived impatience. The Chancellor thereby presents himself as calm, patient and</page><page sequence="10">338 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY reasonable. Overall, this discourse places the Chancellor in a passive pos- ition, spectating on the activities of 4iť, the economy. Potter et al. (1991) show that participants can construct quantification accounts which are designed to be robust in a specific context. An import- ant feature of Major's account is that it renders any account of the recession (and to some extent the economy in general) problematic. We should note that orienting to the socially constructed nature of the social world is not the preserve of students of it; lay analysts too can index the contingently created nature of 'how things appear to be' Furthermore, this strategy is distinct from ontological gerrymandering (Woolgar and Pawluch, 1985), which is the practice of rendering one domain problem- atic, but presenting the writer's own domain as unproblematic. Here Major problematizes a domain without seeking to preserve another free from problems. As we noted earlier, this article offers us more than an insight into how one person, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, deploys language in manag- ing the recession, interesting though that may be. The article is also a step in an emerging narrative which the Guardian is building up and in fact our access to Major's talk is only through that narrative. It is to that narrative which we now turn. One gross fact about the article is that, contrary to the title, the bulk of the article is concerned not with Major, but with Leigh- Pemberton, the Governor of the Bank of England. The overall structure is as follows: (4.1) Elaborates the title indexing talk from the Chancellor. (4.2) Describes the background and introduces talk from Major. (4.3), (4.4) &amp; (4.5) Direct quotations from Major. (4.6) Indexes a talk by Leigh-Pemberton. (4.7), (4.8) &amp; (4.9) Reports on speech from Leigh-Pemberton. (4.10) &amp; (4.11) Offers some economic information. (4.12) Indexes more talk from Leigh-Pemberton which is quoted in (4.13) and reported on in (4.13), (4.14) and (4.15). (4.16) The article closes with a report on the stock market. (4.17) Refers to other features within the newspaper. Thus only four sentences out of the 15 which make up the article actually deal with the topic of the title. Instead we have reports on another public figure, Leigh-Pěmberton, and slices of economic news. This organization can be analysed in connection with a significant question: why doesn't the article actually debate the situation? One possible reason for this is that newspaper writers avoid (or avoid the appearance of) debating evidence and making a case through argument in favour of a straight telling of the news. Argument is officially deputed to the editorial pages where it is clearly titled as such. However, we can see that the article does have resources for presenting an argument. It makes a case through the juxtapo- sition of 'newstelling' with reported speech, direct or indirect, from Major and Leigh-Pemberton. (4.2) exploits a device available to anyone reporting</page><page sequence="11">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 339 speech (or other action) - the chance to build an account which provides a backdrop which can condition the way we hear the speech (or conduct) reported. The backdrop which is painted here in (4.2) is worthy of some analysis. Three things are listed: job losses, corporate collapses and a notable fall in profits, namely at 'Britain's biggest industrial combine'. However in addition to those shadows, the canvas is angled with the claim made in passing that the day was marked by these things. Presumably 25 October 1990 was marked by many things for many different people, but this rhetoric is used to project a dire situation within which, or against which, Major's claim that it is too early to say whether or not there is a recession appears weak. This rhetorical strategy involves setting up a contrast which, like the contrast structures identified by Smith (1978), makes relevant a certain reading of the text which follows. In this case, however, unlike Smith's, the text which follows is a representation of the behaviour to be examined, not a description of it, and the behaviour is not specifically anomalous. On the preparation of audiences for how to hear forthcoming material we may note a device studied by Wooffitt (1992, chapter 6) in his analysis of accounts of paranormal phenomena. He reports on how speakers describ- ing paranormal experiences which they have had may use the format lI was just doing X . . . when Y' (where X is a mundane event and Y is a para- normal event). This establishes their own credentials, orienting their audiences to the normality of themselves and the unusualness of the event. A further matter from the conversation analysis literature may be men- tioned in connection with implications set up by newstelling. Although we cannot attempt a thorough analysis of it here, the contrasts achieved in Extract 4 by juxtaposing newstelling with speech from privileged figures may be related to an interactional phenomenon reported by Pomerantz (1980). She shows how a speaker's limited access may be used as a fishing device , namely that in conversational environments statements from one party about his/her restricted knowledge of a domain, to a recipient who knows more about it, implicate talk about that domain from the recipient. An interesting connection is that in both the cases discussed by Pomerantz and in Extract 4 work can be achieved under cover, without explicit con- frontation. Pomerantz shows how speakers are able to fish for information about delicate matters without explicitly engaging in possibly intimate or sensitive inquiries; Extract 4 shows us the weakness in Major's position without needing to attack him openly. Likewise, Leigh-Pemberton is glossed as having 'further reflected concern about the country's economic situation' and his audience is de- scribed as being 'hard-pressed' (4.6). The report of Leigh-Pemberton's talk is interpolated with six instances of economic problems (ICI, Reliant Group, Polly Peck and Philips in [4.10] and DAF and VSEL in [4.11]). Each of these sentences starts with a temporal construction which serves to give the impression of bad news tumbling in even as the man speaks. The numerical detail here merits some comment. The use of numbers indicates the scale of the current economic problems and enriches the critical report</page><page sequence="12">340 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY being offered. Two features of the organization of the numerical details are (a) that they are given in an order of size, in this case getting progressively smaller, and (b) they are presented as either limits or precise numbers. The ranking means that the evidence is literally 'marshalled', which may serve to maximize its coherence. In (4.10) the two figures given are presented as upper limits: 'as many as 40,000' and 'up to 2,500'. However, the smaller figure in (4.11) is presented as a lower limit 'at least 430'. The final figure '144' is presented as a precise one. The fact that the numbers get progress- ively smaller may arise from the choice of ending with the most concrete piece of evidence: with workers who have actually received redundancy notices. This goes hand in hand with offering a precise figure (as opposed to saying 'around 150'): it maximizes the concreteness of the situation. The placing of lines (4.10) and (4.11) in the middle of the text is interest- ing. There is evidence that typically newspaper stories have a news schema whereby the most important information comes at the beginning, with background and history coming at the end (Van Dijk, 1988). The construc- tion of this article violates this norm; this serves to maximize contrast effects. If all the newstelling had been placed at the start of the article, this would have left Leigh-Pemberton's talk juxtaposed directly with Major's, and so a contrast effect may have been lessened. The organization actually used also serves to flank the sections on both speakers with dire news, not merely to preface them. The third slice of juxtaposed newstelling is the report of stock exchange activity, which, though something of a non sequitur, serves to round off the events against which these two figures are speaking. Finally other features within the newspaper are referred to. These allude to a notorious bank- ruptcy case, a feature on job losses and to a leader on the situation. What Major does not say about a recession can also be front-page news. The absence of the term 'recession' in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement (an annual statement of economic affairs presented to parliament) was considered sufficiently important for a leader to comment on it (Extract 5). Extract 5 MAJOR TRIES TO SQUARE THE CIRCLE (5.1) [. . .] Finessing the idea that the economy might be in recession by talking of 'weak activity' now followed by a resumption of growth later next year, Mr Major managed to find extra resources for health, transport and social security while downplaying the losers - among which the long-term unem- ployed, defence and regional aid programmes are the most prominent. [•••] (5.2) But the Government refuses to accept that the economy overall will go into recession, boxing. and coxing its way around what is happening at the moment and in the first half of next year by referring to year on year averages.

[...]</page><page sequence="13">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 341 (5.4) All depends on the recession being as short lived as the government hopes; and that in turn depends upon interest rate cuts. ( Guardian , 9 November 1990: 1) At this point it is not so much the existence of the recession which is a concern, but its duration and severity. The Chancellor's concession that Britain was in a recession came on 12 November 1990 (Extract 6). Here we restrict ourselves to the opening parts which deal with this 'concession'. Extract 6 MAJOR CONCEDES BRITAIN IS IN 'MODEST' RECESSION (6.1) The Chancellor, John Major, finally conceded last night that the British economy had entered a 'modest recession'. (6.2) The statement is certain to fuel demands from the City and industry for a further cut in interest rates. (6.3) Mr Major, who steadfastly refused to use the word recession during questions on his Autumn Statement on Thursday, told the BBC Money Programme yesterday: (6.4) 'On I suppose the most typical definition of two quarters of falling output, it is probable, I should think now, that we are in a modest recession in the second half of this year.' ( Guardian , 12 November 1990: 26) As in Extract 4, the issue of definition is highlighted and prefaces the admission (6.4), thereby problematizing or minimizing claims that there is a recession. Again his use of that definition is accounted for: he supposes that it is the 'most typical' definition. Secondly the nature of the recession is qualified: (a) it is 'probable', but is a matter of judgement, 'I should think now', (b) it is 'modest' and (c) it is carefully time-indexed : 'in the second half of this year'. Here we have considered some of the rhetorical strategies relating to the evidence that there is, or is not, a recession. We have noted how the newspaper studied makës a case for the existence of a recession by using juxtaposition to achieve contrasts; orients to details as documentary evi- dence; and provides instructions on how to read such evidence. We have also examined how Major introduces definitional considerations to prob- lematize the existence of a recession; presents the recession as a technical/ bureaucratic matter; and finally time-indexes his statement acknowledging the existence of recession. We now move from these broadly evidential issues to examining the ontologies generated through discourse on recession. ANALYSIS PART 2' CONSTRUCTING THE RECESSION Resources: metaphors and other figures of speech A metaphor is a figure of speech where something is described in terms of something else which it literally is not. Metaphor has attracted consider-</page><page sequence="14">342 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY able attention in disciplines as diverse as poetics, rhetoric, philosophy and cognitive psychology. A recurring theme in these disciplines is that meta- phors (at least good metaphors) mobilize linguistic resources in order to achieve a particular potency of meaning. A range of metaphors and other figures of speech are used in newspaper coverage of the recession. Analysis of them is interesting because they show different ways of construing what the recession is and what properties it has. Two groups of metaphors are particularly evident in our material, one which presents the recession as something which can hit, cut or bite, and another which uses vocabulary pertaining to movement. The first group offers a way of characterizing the consequences of the recession, and also, through that, the evidence for it. 'Hitting' is a dead metaphor (i.e. its metaphorical meaning has been lost) and is widely used in connection with the recession, for example in the headlines, recession hitting hardest in areas most vulnerable for tories at general election ( Guardian , 15 November: 1990: 12; emphasis added) and depressed areas hit as contract scheme goes ( Guardian , 1 December 1990: 15; emphasis added). The latter article goes on to say: 'Axing the Government Contracts Preference Scheme, set up in the 1930s, seems likely to cause a storm of protest in parts of the country already hard hit by the recession' (emphasis added). A more lively metaphor is that of biting : 'As the recession bites . . .' ( Guardian , 30 November 1990: 15; emphasis added). This is used cleverly in an article on a fast-food retailer to set up imagery relating to eating, and points to the effects of competition in that sector: 'With recession biting deeper analysts expect an intensification of the burger wars with consumers hungry for bargains' (emphasis added). This kind of imagery sees the recession in an active position and it suggests dramatic effects. It does not, however, say who, or what, is responsible for the recession. Such imagery is not politically potent in the sense that it does not place the blame with the government or the type of society in which we live. The same metaphor of cutting is wittily applied in the headline a recession that could cut right into the bone. This headline puns on the imagery of British industry becoming 'leaner and fitter' which was an emblem used by Thatcher when unemployment rose sharply in the early 1980s. The second group of metaphors, which use movement imagery, can offer scope for analysis of what or who is responsible for the recession. Govern- ment control over, and responsibility for, the economy can be character- ized in expressions such as 'But if Mr Major and Mr Lamont are to steer the economy out of recession . . .' ( Guardian , 29 November 1990: 13; emphasis added). The scale of the movement task is indicated by a verb such as haul , for example: 'The Confederation of British Industry yesterday urged the Government to haul the economy out of recession after its gloomiest survey of manufacturers for a decade' ( Guardian , 31 October 1990: 1; emphasis added). Movement imagery may also be used to imply a lack of control, as in the following: 'Fresh evidence of the pace of Britain's slide</page><page sequence="15">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 343 into recession . . .' ( Guardian , 7 November 1990: 14; emphasis added); 'With the economy lurching into recession what will happen to it all?' ( Guardian , 20 November 1990: 15); 4 . . . and the country accelerating into the worst recession since the war. ... As the recession rolls on, we will discover that financial improprieties are systemic in our non-regulated and un-policed financial services sector' ( Guardian , 24 December 1990: 10; emphasis added). Apart from the two main types of metaphors used there are others. The severity of the recession may also be captured using spatial/movement language, for example: The UK economy has plunged into a deep recession as high interest rates and a strong pound take their toll of output, exports, jobs and investment, according to a survey published yesterday' (Guardian, 24 October 1990; emphasis added). Another set of metaphors uses vocabulary relating to weather. For example one article (an editorial which we examine below) is entitled tossed in the eye of the storm ( Guardian , 26 October 1990: 18). It states: The hurricane of high interest rates, combined with a strong currency, is claiming victims big and small as the recession cuts out the year-by-year growth they had taken for granted' (emphasis added). Again, the destruc- tive properties of the recession are captured by this, though it can be extended to comment on reactions to the economic situation, as in the headline the Italian buccaneer weathers heavy storms of the recession. This article talks of 'Fiat and Olivetti battening down the hatches for recession' ( Guardian , 12 December 1990: 15; emphasis added). . A final observation may be made. During October, articles talk of the economy being in recession. At the end of the month, however, an edi- torial speaks of Britain being in recession: LOCKED INTO THE TEN-YEAR BOX The question posed by yesterday's deeply worrying CBI [Confederation of British Industry] survey is whether Britain is in the middle of a mild recession or on the brink of a re-run of the slump of 1980/81, when the whole economy contracted by 3.5 per cent and the manufacturing base by around 20 per cent. ( Guardian , 31 October 1990: 20) Strategies We now turn to examine how rhetorical resources are coordinated within specific articles. We have chosen to analyse two contrasting texts. The first consists of direct and indirect speech from Leigh-Pemberton reported in an article in the Financial Times , the second is an editorial from the Guardian. Extract 7 (7.1) [. . .] Mr Leigh-Pemberton said in Channel 4's Answering Back pro- gramme: (7.2) 'It is because our position in the [ERM] band is rather lower than I would like to see it that it is not possible immediately to respond, say, to better inflation figures ... by lowering interest rates.' [...]</page><page sequence="16">344 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY (7.3) Mr Leigh-Pemberton would not be drawn on how much sterling would have to appreciate before interest rates could be cut, but said that (7.4) 'the exchange rate will have to be confident and more healthy' [•••] (7.5) 'This is what is important - the market should see that the policy makers in this country are not helping themselves to interest rate falls before they are as objectively merited as they can possibly be.' [...] (7.6) 4I have to say too that I felt that we were premature in allowing interest rates to go down on the day in question.' [...] (7.7) 'I felt that we were taking our dividend a little before it was earned. (7.8) I would have liked us to have been patient by a day or two.' (7.9) The governor said he had written 'as forcefully as he could' to the govern- ment outlining his disagreements over the timing of the last base rate cut. [...] (7.10) 'We are somewhere near where the basic inflationary trend in the econ- omy has been corrected. (7.11) Provided we are not too greedy in snatching the advantages which flow from that, I think we might be able to say that we will have a shallow recession out of which we have a recovery which will be soundly based/ {Financial Times , 17 December 1990: 8) In most cases in the text, a we is defined in terms of a common relation- ship to the following: 'the [ERM] band', 'inflation figures', 'sterling', 'exchange rate', 'interest rate', 'dividend', 'recession', 'inflationary trend', 'recovery', 'the market' and 'the economy'. These terms can be regarded as aspects or manifestations of the economy: ; thus the ontology of the dis- course recognized in this text includes the economy (and its aspects) on the one hand and the people ('us', 'we') on the other. We will therefore refer to the main discourse inhabiting this text as people versus economy. In contrasting the economy with the people , the former is constructed as something distinct and separate from the social. The speaker's use of an organism metaphor for the economy emphasizes the reification of the econ- omy. This is evidenced, for example, by talk of the 'confidence' and 'health' of the 'exchange rate' (7.4). In constructing the economy as an independent 'thing', the speaker draws attention away from any heterogeneity in the us that the economy is defined against. The only hint of differences within the 'us' category is the particularization of 'the policy makers in this country' (7.5). However, it is clear from the speaker's subsequent statements (7.6, 7.7) that 'we' are all on the same side - 'the policy makers', the speaker, and everyone else covered by the term 'us' have a common relationship with the economy and thus a shared interest in how the economy fares; 'the policy makers' are merely representatives or personifications of the general us. Thus, the people versus economy discourse constructs a consensus model of social relationships. The disagreement between 'the policy makers' and the speaker is merely over tactics - how best (for all of us) to 'respond' to the economy. There is no implication that the social relationships in question consist of competition between capitalists, let alone conflicts of interest</page><page sequence="17">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 345 between capitalists and workers; all are in the same boat and share the same concerns. This point is developed below. We distinguish two types of relationship in the people versus economy discourse: first, economy as* active ( people as passive ), and secondly, econ- omy as passive ( people as active). Aspects of the economy are active in the claim that 'we' might 'respond' to 'inflation figures' (7.2), and in (7.3) and (7.4), in which the people's options are constrained by the development of the economy . Here, then, the economy seems to be a prime mover; it has its own dynamic, and the causes of its development are independent of 'us'. Like an active organism, the economy stands against the people as an alien 'thing'; it has its own interests and aims which are different from ours , and it is in a position potentially to 'see' (7.5) how 'we' react to it. However, the people are potentially active in the suggestion that 'the policy makers' might be 'helping themselves to interest rate falls' (7.5), and in (7.6) and (7.7), where the distinction between 'the policy makers' and others is glossed: 'we' allowed 'interest rates' to go down, 'we' took 'our dividend'. Similarly, in (7.11), 'we' have the power to 'snatch advantages'. It is interesting that this discourse uses terms from both technical eco- nomics (e.g. 'taking our dividend') and everyday economics (e.g. 'Provid- ing we are not too greedy in snatching the advantages') and also fusions of the two in 'helping themselves to interest rate falls'. Once we are in the active position there is an implicit paradox: if we can control the economy , how is it that we are sometimes at its mercy? The potential contradiction is not explicit in the present text, however. By invoking a discourse of merit , the speaker implies a dynamic social re- lationship of give and take, of fair (or equal) exchange between the people and (aspects of) the economy. This is a solution to the paradox because there are occasions where we must choose to be passive: 'I felt that we were taking our dividend a little before it was earned. I would have liked us to have been patient by a day or two' (7.7 and 7.8). This discourse of merit first makes its appearance in (7.5), where the speaker floats the possibility of 'the policy makers' acting unfairly and deceitfully. The merit discourse, and the theme of fair exchange, is evident also in (7.7), (7.8) and (7.11): provided the people give their due - the human virtues of patience and modesty - we will receive in return the economy we deserve: 'a shallow recession out of which we have a recovery which will be soundly based'. By constructing us as active, and by drawing upon the merit discourse, arguments that we must all pull together and we must 'all tighten our belts' are legitimized. In other words, an exhortation to wage restraint is justified; this is our way of affecting the economy. The immediate context of the discourses under analysis here was the interviewing of the Governor of the Bank of England on the topic of the economy in general and the (disputed) recession in particular. The speaker's immediate aim was both to show a united front with the govern- ment (e.g. the battle against inflation as the primary objective) and yet to distance himself from past tactical errors. The immediate rhetorical aim was thus a qualified endorsement of the government's perspective on the</page><page sequence="18">346 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY recession. The dilemma for the speaker, as for others who postulate a market responding to signals , is that, on the one hand, there has to be a way of persuading others (policy makers and wage-earners) to recognize the seriousness of the situation and to act cautiously, and, on the other hand, there is the requirement not to talk the economy into a recession by affecting our or the economy's confidence. Hence the speaker's ambiguity over whether the (or a) recession is actually happening now (7.11), his cautious optimism, and his implied suggestion that a soundly based recov- ery can be a product of a 'shallow recession'. Extract 8 TOSSED IN THE EYE OF THE STORM (8.1) ICI's 50 per cent fall in profits in the third quarter of the year is a jolting reminder that this recession is hitting the well-managed companies as well as everyone else. (8.2) ICI, traditionally the bell-wether of the British economy, is quoting the strength of sterling as one of the main reasons for its shrivelled profits - which have already led to cut backs in capital investment. (8.3) The company made its views on overvaluation of the pound pretty plain a few weeks ago (as it did before the 1980/81 recession), but the Govern- ment ignored all that and promptly locked sterling into a strong relation- ship with the mark. (8.4) ICI will, doubtless, survive, but a lot of other companies will go under, many of them unnecessarily. (8.5) As Christopher Morris of the accountants, Touche Ross, warned earlier this week: (8.6) no British company is now safe from collapse. (8.7) The hurricane of high interest rates, combined with a strong currency, is claiming victims big and small as the recession cuts out the year-by-year growth they had taken for granted. (8.8) The first casualties have been debt-driven enterprises where corporate acquisitiveness took precedence over the simple economics of running the shop. (8.9) Unlike previous recessions, this one has been characterised by the crash of companies which were so busy taking over other companies that they failed to plan for what might happen if interest rates stayed high and the economic boom subsided. (8.10) They thought lunch would go on for ever. (8.11) This is why the first scythe of recession has cut down companies like British and Commonwealth, Coloroll and Polly Peck, all of which have sound underlying businesses within them. (8.12) Many of the other fallen idols - from Habitat and Next through struggling Saatchi and Saatchi to the pressurised empires of Murdoch and Max- well - have been created by debt-driven expansionism of a kind which is beginning to worry even the most fervent free marketeers. (8.13) Earlier this week the Secretary for Trade, Peter Lilley, admitted that deal- making in London's capital market had gone (8.14) 'beyond the economically justifiable to become almost an end in itself'. (8.15) He attributes the growth of deal-making partly to the dominance in board- rooms of people with a financial background and partly to the pressure</page><page sequence="19">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 347 from institutional investors to deliver consistent growth in dividends. (8.16) The blame for all this is widely shared. (8.17) If the Government had entered the ERM years ago, then lower interest rates might have averted the worst excesses. (8.18) Had Mr Lilley's department required acquisitive companies to prove posi- tive benefits before being allowed to proceed with take-over bids, the outcome might have been different. (8.19) If banks had been more careful lending money, merger mania could have been subdued. (8.20) If auditors had lived up to their reputations (let alone their fat com- missions) then trouble could have been spotted earlier. (8.21) The auditors of Polly Peck, in particular, might explain how a company valued at £2 billion barely three months ago is now worth less than one of the firm's oranges. (8.22) Short-termism in the City is at the heart of the problem - companies trying to achieve by financial aggrandisement what they failed to do through organic growth. (8.23) Now, above all, the quality, culture and vision of management must rise. (8.24) Companies must stop making deals and go back to producing goods and services. ( Guardian , 26 October 1990: 18) The main discourse inhabiting this text is that of economy versus capital. As the name implies, the discourse entails the separation of two (sorts of) objects, which then exist in opposition to each other. Other categories of objects distinguished are 'auditors', 'banks' and 'government'. The econ- omy versus capital discourse contains the following type of relationship: economy as active (capital as passive ), economy as passive (capital as active ), short-termist capital active (victim-of-takeover capital passive) , government active (economy passive , capital passive ), banks active (econ- omy passive , capital passive) and finally auditors as non-alert parasites (versus auditors as alert observers). The story told by the text can be summarized as follows: banks, govern- ment and auditors have encouraged (by not discouraging) a certain capital- ist subject (short-termism) which has in turn affected the economy, cre- ating an indiscriminate recession which is now moving by its own momentum (i.e. is far less easy to control). The conflicts and continuities in this story will be unravelled next and those things it does and does not allow elaborated by detailing, first, the objects it describes and, second, the relationships it contains. The analysis of this text suggests two major categories of objects and a number of minor ones. The ontology recognizably forming aspects of the capital object-group includes the following: 'ICI', 'profits', 'well-managed companies', 'debt-driven enterprises', 'British and Commonwealth', 'insti- tutional investors', 'growth dividends', 'take-over bids', 'one of Polly Peck's oranges' and 'deals'. Objects comprising the economy object-group include the following: 'recession', 'high interest rates', 'a strong currency', 'an economic boom' and 'ERM'. Minor categories of objects included the</page><page sequence="20">348 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY following: 'the government' (e.g. 'Mr Lilley's department'), 'auditors' and 'banks'. The dominant type of relationship in the text is that of economy as active (capital as passive ). This is evidenced in (8.1), (8.2), (8.7), (8.9) and (8.11). Thus the recession is hitting all companies (8.1); it is not integrated with or essential to such companies; rather it is external to them and impinges on them only violently and abruptly. Being active, it is a prime mover to which capital (in the form of the companies) must respond. Hence, companies should have planned around it (8.9), taking account of its independent pattern of development (high interest rates and booms), its independent logic. Certain metaphors are readily available to achieve this reification of the economy. The title of the text itself points to the most potent of these; aspects of the economy manifest themselves as a 'hurricane' according to (8.7). Like a hurricane, the recession is said to be a blind, unstoppable force; it is indiscriminate and, now that it has begun, there is not much that can be done to avoid its effects. In contrast with this, the text implies at the very beginning that the relationship between capital and the economy can be the reverse of this, and in quite a direct way. The 'bell-wether' metaphor of (8.2) suggests that certain aspects of capital (well-managed companies) can influence, even lead, 'the British economy' and thus other companies. Clearly the speaker does not want to construct the economy as always and inevitably antagon- istic to, and dominating, capital; ultimately it is implied, capital can affect not-capital (here, the economy) although it just is not doing so at present - and indeed it is possibly too late for economy as passive ( capital as active) to be the dominant type of relationship. To explain how this situation has come to be, and how, indeed, capital can ultimately be responsible for its own nemesis (the grim reaper metaphor of [8.1lj), the speaker has to develop a third type of relationship: capital's relation with itself. Capital's engagement with itself is enabled by the relationship; short- termist capital active ( victim- of -take over capital passive) . This relationship splits capital into those parts which are capable of affecting others and those which have no power. Being capable of affecting others, that part of capital which is active is a subject that can articulate itself in a number of different ways. The argument mobilized by the speaker here is that when that part of capital which was active had the choice to affect itself (i.e. to affect capital as a whole), it chose the short- termist option; such a choice considerably restricts, and may even eliminate, future manoeuvrability by handing over the baton to the economy as an active agent (the blind, unstoppable force discussed above). The economy, since it is implied to be mindless (blind, like the weather), cannot be blamed for its effects even when it has agency. But constructing capital as (in part) active, and as having a voice, allows attribution of blame in this direction. Thus the 'debt- driven enterprises' are blamed (8.8) and (8.12) through use of a small business or domestic budget metaphor which resonates strongly with Margaret Thatcher's well-known 'housekeeping' analogy for the British economy.</page><page sequence="21">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 349 But the fact that capital, by handing over power to the economy ('recession'), has relinquished its free will means that such recriminations will not serve much purpose; capital is no longer in a position 'to do otherwise'. Although '[s]hort-termism in the City is at the heart of the problem' (8.22), this cause is itself an effect of other things, ultimate agents, with whom the buck must finally rest: government, banks and auditors. Government adopts only one type of position in this text; it is always active, whether in relation to capital or the economy ; it is the ultimate prime mover. It was government which ignored the interests and pleas of capital by locking 'sterling into a strong relationship with the mark' (8.3); and it is government (in the form of 'Mr Lilley's department') which has the power to veto short-termist takeover bids (8.18). Similarly, the banks, like some kind of monetary medics, are said to have the power to 'subdue' 'merger mania'; they should have been more careful in lending their money (8.19). Finally, although not a causal agent in the above senses, the auditors (as potentially alert observers) are also constructed as blameworthy. They have the power to observe and to explain (their 'reputation'), but chose not to use this power (8.20), (8.21); instead, their only activity has been to maintain their 'fat commissions' (8.20). They therefore complete the triad of those ultimately responsible for the predominance of 'short-termism' in capital's relation with itself and thus the free hand given to recession ; between them, government, banks ànd auditors have the power to pre- vent, diagnose and control the ills of capital and the economy. The text tells a coherent story of dereliction of duty and responsibility. The manifest problem is the active economy. Being ultimately limited in its intelligence, however, this agent cannot be blamed. We can blame (part of) capital; but since capital's free will is itself granted and monitored by government, banks and auditors, it is these three that are ultimately responsible. The discourse inhabiting the present text is one which func- tions to attribute blame by distinguishing between levels of agency; only those 'ultimately responsible' should ultimately be blamed. Contrasting strategies We noted that, in Extract 7, the two agents (the people and the economy) are active at different times, although not in a causal sequence such that the people are constructed as ultimately responsible for the economy's agency. By contrast, the writer in Extract 8, although agreeing that both the government (subsumed under the people in Extract 7) and the economy could be active, suggests that only one of these subjects (government) is a self-mediating agent - the other is derivative. A parallel contrast can be drawn between the intelligence the speaker in Extract 7 attributes to the economy and the mindlessness ascribed to the economy in Extract 8. Although the discourses drawn upon by these speakers reify the economy in a similar way, their arguments allow blame to be apportioned quite</page><page sequence="22">350 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY differently in each case. For the speaker in Extract 7, the interpolation of 'the policy makers' into the people category allows everyone that is not-the- economy to share in the responsibility for the future of the economy. And, although past policies are blamed for the less than optimally 'healthy' state of the economy , there is no implication that the economy has ever been other than a 'thing' with an independent agency. For the author of Extract 8, on the other hand, since the appearance of aspects of the economy as an independent agent can be traced ultimately to specific types of people (banks, government, auditors), only those particularized in this way should be held responsible. A consequence that the two extracts have in common, despite their differences in rhetorical aim, is their effect of separating their readers from their subject matter. Although the speaker in Extract 7 constructs the people as potentially able to affect the economy , this very opposition excludes us, the readers, from this 'thing', the economy ; we impinge upon it from outside. Similarly, in Extract 8, both writer and reader are con- signed to the position of observers; we are outside the relation between capital and the economy ; implicitly: we are victims of processes far away; all we see are the throes of the 'storm' the writer describes. The writer is an invisible expert (judge, critic); but the rest of us are simply invisible. If we are unnecessary in this way then capital and the economy are independent things, subjects in their own right who do not owe their existence to 'us'. In Extracts 4 and 6, however, a different form of separation is at work. Here the speaker constructs himself as an active analyser, definer and diagnostician of the economy. There is an implicit paradox here. As the simple observer ('waiting and seeing'), the speaker is at the mercy of the emergence of this possibly pre-existing thing, a recession. But, by qualify- ing his position as a mere observer with remarks about definitions, he assumes a more powerful position - one who ultimately decides 'what is'. The speaker therefore can avoid blame for a recession by disputing its existence. Now aspects of the economy such as the recession are not simply separated from the people , the government and capital - they are separated from the material realm altogether and exist ultimately as ideas, descrip- tions, accounts on pieces of paper. DISCUSSION The first part of the study examined rhetoric concerning whether there was a recession during the last quarter of 1990. On the part of newspapers we noted techniques of juxtaposition to achieve contrasts, deployment of evidence and provision of instructions on how it should be read. Concerning talk reported or presented in newspaper articles we noted the display of defini- tional considerations and contextualizing strategies like time-indexing. The second part of this study began by describing some metaphors and tropes that are available to commentators constructing 'the recession' in newspaper articles. The two most common types can be divided into those</page><page sequence="23">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 351 that attribute to the economy an independent agency ('hitting', 'biting', etc.), and those which construct the economy as under the control of government forces ('haul', 'steer', etc.). There is also an issue which inter- sects with the evidential development reported in Part 1. As events unfolded, the concerns and terminology of newspaper articles changed: whether or not there was a recession versus the 'depth' and 'severity' of 'the recession', and talk of 'the economy in recession' versus 'Britain in recession'. Finally, we analysed in detail two specific extracts for the structure of their arguments and the functions of the discourses they draw upon. Thus we noted a tendency to construct the economy (including the recession) as something essentially separate from the social, to reify it as an independent 'thing'. This parallels some of the ways in which Bowers and Iwi (1993) identify 'society' being performed in everyday talk. For example they note that speakers may formulate 'society' as an active agent or a passive object and as including them or as separate from them. Various strategies were employed to overcome the potential drawbacks of constructing the economy as separate and independent. The drawbacks consist in the powerlessness which such constructions attribute to human subjects such as politicians, whose job it is to use power. The strategies consist in: using a merit discourse (Extract 7), problematizing the definition of a recession (Extracts 4 and 6) and attributing ultimate responsibility for the creation of this independent recession to the government (e.g. Extract 8). We noted in the introduction to this paper the tendency of many re- searchers to treat constructs such as the economy and the recession as independent variables. Arguably, this kind of treatment of these constructs echoes the very reification we have been analysing here (particularly Extracts 7 and 8). The assumption at work in all these cases is that a social totality can be broken up into various parts that can be understood and studied as parts - that the social and economic spheres and the sphere of capital are independent, separate and self-motivating rather than mutually defining. Having analysed a number of competing versions of the economy in general and the recession in particular, it is possible to argue that none of them can claim a privileged position as a veridical description of the econ- omy; all exist to fulfil certain functions, whether they be political-rhetorical (as in the cases analysed here) or research-experimental (breaking things up into 'independent variables' - as in the work cited in our introduction); none maps onto this supposedly 'pre-existing thing' the economy (as they would claim); all construct that thing, and exist in relation to competing accounts. Potter et al. (1991) argue that we should view quantification accounts, of which certain arguments concerning the economy might be included, as designed for their robustness in an argumentative arena. Their study of a television documentary on cancer research supports this thesis; partici- pants and interviewees were concerned with creating renditions which would stand up to counter-arguments. They further note how the makers</page><page sequence="24">352 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY of the documentary problematize resources such as cure rates in order to criticize cancer research. Similarly, we note that John Major's somewhat equivocal statements on the recession (Extracts 4 and 6) problematize what a recession is; recession as a thing independent of our understanding is undermined - now it is a matter of definitions. However, this point about the independent existence of aspects of the economy being subverted by the then Chancellor's use of an argument about definitions does not contradict the basic thesis of the present paper - that different protagonists in the debate over the economy and the recession all reify these constructs; in dispute with each other, they simply reify the economy in different ways and with different emphases. Indeed, it is only because the economy is reified by all sides that Major's position is effective; the reification is the necessary backdrop, the assumption underlying Major's rhetorical gambit. So how do we explain this backdrop, this tendency on all sides to con- struct the economy in certain characteristic ways (i.e. as an independent variable, like an organism, separate from the social, separate from capital, which is itself separate from the social)? How does this common character- ization, and its closely related variations (storm-like, active, passive, etc.) come about, and what are its wider ideological effects? In part, it could be argued, these effects are very much a product of the way in which the English language itself represents economic processes. For example, the speaker is obliged to say (7.11) that 'we' will 'have' (rather than 'be') a 'recession'. Similarly, we are 'in' the '[ERM] band' (7.2) and 'near' where 'the basic inflationary trend in the economy has been corrected' (7.10). Contrast these kinds of tropes with the English language's treatment of illness, for example. While we talk of 'having' an illness, we can also talk of 'being' ill; in this case we seem to have the option of defining the object as a personal state or process, rather than something we own or cohabit with. We would argue against any attempt to formulate talk of the 'economy' as 'merely' linguistic or coincidental. This could only be the case if talk was stripped of its consequentiality. As ethnomethodology, speech act theory and other disciplines have taught us, talk has important performative func- tions. As Thompson (1984) argues, discourse contributes significant ideo- logical consequences in three ways: the presentation of situations of domi- nation and exploitation as legitimate and proper; the masking of the existence of these situations; and the reification of current social relation- ships as natural or essential. If this is correct, then the discourses under analysis here, insofar as they are ideological, are predicated upon certain social relationships of exploitation. Thus the question arises: how do these relationships produce and facilitate these discourses? How are the dis- courses taken up and accepted as neutral accounts? What is their basis in social relationships, their moment of truth? Marx (1867/1976) left us with an answer to this. On his account, wher- ever there is an economy producing goods for exchange (rather than for need), commodity fetishism will occur. The ideological aspect of commo-</page><page sequence="25">rae &amp; drury: Rhetoric and economic recession 353 dity fetishism is the belief that commodities (including money) naturally have the power to do such things as hire labour, enter into relations with other things and with humanity, and create wealth. The private labour necessarily entailed by commodity production atomizes the relations be- tween producers. The mediation and regulation of the social relationships between producers by commodities is thus the basis for this belief in the independent existence and agency of things - money and products of human labour. Like commodity fetishism, the discourses analysed here are ideological in that they collapse contingent, social processes ( the economy) and relationships (between people and capital) into natural and necessary ones. Moreover, it has been argued that the very possibility of economic discourse in the first place, never mind the particular forms it takes, depends on a certain social formation: 'only when economic activity be- comes disembedded and conducted through separate institutional spheres can it become visible and thus available as a topic of discourse' (Emmison, 1983: 142). The present study is, of necessity, limited in a number of ways. There is considerably more scope for analysing changes over time, such as the movement of recession-related articles from the financial pages of news- papers to the front page, and the place given to the recession in different articles. There are a number of other sites where, and ways in which, analysis of economic discourse might be usefully applied. First, there is scope for further analysis of the social relationships pic- tured when economic affairs are discussed. For example in Extract 4, (4.13) through to (4.15), Leigh-Pemberton warns bankers of the need to be sympathetic to their borrowers in hard times and states that the Bank of England would chair negotiations between lenders and borrowers in certain cases. This is pertinent because bankers are being asked not to apply pure market policies, but are being invited to constrain their con- duct, operating according to 'prudence' with the Bank of England as a referee. It is interesting to see this under a government which held laissez- faire economics in such high regard. Here we see a phenomenon to which Durkheim alerted us long ago in his criticisms of the individualism of utilitarian economic theory which saw social order emerging from a notion of basic or pure economic transactions. Durkheim argued that there are non-contractual obligations surrounding economic exchanges (such as the requirement that parties consent to exchange) and that even the most basic exchange of goods takes place within a set of social relations (Durkheim, 1893/1968, book 1, chapter 7; see also Barnes, 1988: 22-4). Comparisons across different newspapers might show different reper- toires and resources used for different ends. Attention to other media, such as television, magazines and political manifestos, is also an important area. A further domain is talk-in-interaction, from everyday conversation to political interviews. Analysis could be related to argumentation around specific historical events such as elections. Emmison's (1983) content analysis of changes in constructions of the economy across this century is an example of this. This could be extended to comparisons across particular</page><page sequence="26">354 DISCOURSE &amp; SOCIETY periods such as the post-war 'consensus' and Thatcherism. Dry though it may appear, economic discourse is too important for polity to be ignored.
