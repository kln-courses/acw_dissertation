<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> N i N e Networks and Social Memory Chapters 7 and 8 outline the tangible and conceptual resources deployed by  those who sought power at Roble phase Sites PVN 144, PVN 306, and Naco.  The networks created in part through the strategic use of those assets linked  contemporaries of different political ranks. Preeminence is greatly strength- ened, however, if power differences are rooted in the past (Alcock 2000; Bloch  1977a, 1977b; Casey 1987; Hendon 2000; Schank and Abelson 1995). Insofar  as rulers can fashion credible narratives linking their present prerogatives to  ancient precedents, they can clothe dynamic and contingent power relations  within timeless schemes that encourage acceptance of that which cannot be  changed. Magnates therefore generally contend for control over social memory,  the widely accepted recollection of earlier events, and the perceived relevance  of those events for present circumstances (Van Dyke and Alcock 2003: 2).  Such efforts take many forms. In some cases the current significance of real  or imagined past actions and personages may be stressed (Casey 1987: 206;  DeMarrais, Castillo, and Earle 1996; Huyssen 2003: 101; Meskell 2003;  Schank and Abelson 1995). Monuments may therefore be raised to commem- orate a ruler’s ancestors, or specific locales may be singled out for special treat- ment. In this way, physically salient constructions help “anchor the past in the  203 </page> <page sequence="2"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y present” (Meskell 2003: 36). Alternatively, inconvenient “truths” may be pur- posefully forgotten by hiding signs of them from general view. Thus memorials  to earlier leaders can be buried and sites tied up with specific memories rein- terpreted or ignored (Casey 1987: 186–189; Joyce 2003: 116–120; Schreiber  2005: 250–251; Van Dyke and Alcock 2003: 3). Would-be leaders, therefore, must not only forge ties with those with  whom they live but also create believable connections with antecedents who  populate a remembered past (Beaudry, Cook, and Mrozowski 1991; Casey  1987: 216–230). Successful co-optation of power requires, in other words, that  elites place themselves at the nexus of webs that extend out horizontally in the  present and back, vertically, into history. Failure to accomplish these twin goals  weakens leaders’ claims to power and their ability to transmit those privileges  into the future. reachiNg iNto the Past through architecture The clearest sign that Site PVN 306’s rulers made direct claims on the past is  evidenced by their preservation of architecture associated with what had been  a Terminal Classic center located 3 m east of the eastern principal plaza (EPP)  (see also Rice 2009 for a comparable example from the Maya lowlands). The  focal point of the earlier occupation is Str. 306-105 (see figure 3.2). This stone- faced platform stood 1.9 m high during its final construction stage, measured  12.34 m north-south, and supported an extensive earthen-floored summit that  covered 7.2 m north-south (the building’s east-west dimensions were not re- vealed). Structure 306-105 is near the exact center of a group of twenty-one  surface-visible structures that together cover 7,300 m2. Plazas are not obvious  within most of this densely nucleated cluster; the only two such patios pivot  on Str. 306-105, extending east and south of that building. Excavations in this  portion of the settlement uncovered all or most of six edifices, including Str.  306-105. Four of these buildings are low platforms 0.23–0.66 m high, and one  is a surface-level construction whose perimeter was defined by substantial stone  foundations. All five of these edifices apparently served as residences, whereas  Str. 306-105’s considerable size and lack of such built-in furniture as benches  in its final version indicate that it was a focal point for community gatherings  and possibly worship. A second nucleus of Terminal Classic occupation lies 260 m west of the  eastern cluster. Here, four substantial platforms (Strs. 306-1/4) bound a pa- tio on all sides. Limited excavations on Strs. 306-1 and 306-4 revealed that  they were stone-faced, earth-filled platforms standing 0.5–0.74 m high. Based  on their forms and associated artifacts, these edifices were likely residences.  Structure 306-54, a 0.12-m-high stone-faced terrace situated 36 m southwest  204 </page> <page sequence="3"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y and downslope from this plaza group, was apparently raised to slow erosion  below the patio’s southwest flank. It is not clear what, if any, Terminal Classic construction existed between  these two foci. An extensive, minimally 0.46-m-thick midden deposit dating  to this interval was encountered beneath Str. 306-128 on the east edge of the  EPP. This and scattered finds of diagnostic Terminal Classic remains in tests  dug into the EPP indicate that trash relating to the period spread over a consid- erable area west of the eastern architectural nucleus. Settlement was not appar- ently continuous, however, between the east and west structure aggregates. Site PVN 306’s Terminal Classic occupation was substantial. The presence  of the monumental Str. 306-105 here sets it apart from most of the relatively  small settlements dating to this span. Instead, Terminal Classic Site PVN 306  was among thirteen contemporary settlements that contained 1–13 platforms  standing at least 1.5 m tall (figure 9.1). These sizable constructions imply that  the sites in question were foci of political power; at least some of their residents  could command the labor to raise monumental platforms (Schortman and  Urban 2004b). Site PVN 306 falls toward the small end of that range, suggest- ing that its leaders were less powerful than some of their contemporaries in the  Naco valley. There are several striking features about the way Site PVN 306’s Terminal  Classic constructions were treated during the Roble phase. First, they were  left standing throughout the late prehistoric occupation of the center. There  is little evidence that stones were recycled from these earlier edifices into their  successors’ facades and foundations. In fact, all of the investigated buildings,  save Str. 306-105, were very well preserved when excavated; Str. 306-105 had  been heavily looted in recent times. Site PVN 306’s late prehistoric inhabit- ants, therefore, did not take advantage of the readily available supplies of build- ing materials presented by the Terminal Classic edifices but left them largely  untouched, albeit in ruined states. Second, there are only slight hints that any of the studied buildings were  used during the Roble phase. Artifacts dating to this span were rarely identified  in assemblages associated with or overlying Terminal Classic architecture. This  absence is all the more striking given the EPP’s proximity to ruins of the earlier  occupation; a scant 3 m separates Strs. 306-123 and 306-121, which were built  roughly 400 years apart. Not only were Roble phase occupants of the settle- ment refraining from robbing stones associated with earlier edifices, they were  also not jettisoning their trash onto these buildings. Third, seven burials were found on and around three structures dating to  the Terminal Classic in the eastern cluster. The locations of these interments,  resting above the bases of platform facings, strongly indicate that they were  introduced well after the buildings were abandoned. Unfortunately, none of  205 </page> <page sequence="4"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y Figure 9.1 Map of settlement distribution within the Late and Terminal Classic Naco  valley. Note the juxtaposition of Sites PVN 99 and Naco, on the one hand, and Sites PVN  144 and PVN 128, on the other. these burials included any temporally diagnostic grave goods; nor were clear  pit lines associated with them. Their high stratigraphic positions in relation  to Terminal Classic architecture, however, point to interment having taken  place well after the buildings were abandoned and earth had begun to accumu- late around them. Given the absence of clear markers relating the remains to  the post-Conquest period, these individuals were very likely buried during the  Roble phase. The last prehistoric denizens of the settlement, therefore, appar- ently treated at least parts of the Terminal Classic settlement as a necropolis.  There were no signs of late burials in the western patio group. 206 </page> <page sequence="5"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y Finally, the very close juxtaposition of the EPP and the largest concen- tration of Terminal Classic architecture at Site PVN 306 is striking. Surface  evidence and excavations elsewhere at the center indicate that Site PVN 306’s  main plazas could have been erected on many other portions of this relatively  flat terrace. Location of the EPP directly adjoining Str. 306-105 and its sur- rounding aggregate was therefore not dictated by any obvious practical neces- sity. Rather, there was something about the eastern Terminal Classic architec- tural cluster that attracted the premier Roble phase household to build next  to it. A similar situation may also pertain at Site PVN 144. Here, the Terminal  Classic remains are much more substantial, represented by the six monumental  constructions and twenty-two smaller platforms that comprise Site PVN 128,  0.25 km to the northeast (Schortman and Urban 2004b; figures 9.1, 9.2).  The latter settlement was one of the largest Terminal Classic centers in the  Naco valley as measured by the sizes and numbers of its component buildings.  Excavations conducted at Site PVN 128 uncovered 936 m2 in the course of  clearing fourteen buildings, three of which were sizable platforms 1.4–2.6 m  high (Schortman and Urban 2004b). These investigations revealed that, like  Site PVN 306’s eastern cluster, Site PVN 128 was a focal point for hierarchi- cally organized networks centered on a cadre of elite residents at the settlement  (Schortman and Urban 2004b). Based on differences in the scale and number  of their constructions, Site PVN 128’s rulers apparently exercised more power,  possibly over a larger population, than did their contemporaries at Site PVN  306. These differences aside, the Terminal Classic buildings at Sites PVN 128  and PVN 306 were treated in much the same ways. Specifically, platforms at  the former settlement evinced little evidence of damage from ancient stone  robbing. They were apparently left relatively untouched until recent times,  when looting and road construction took their toll on the edifices. Further,  despite the short distance separating Sites PVN 128 and PVN 144, very little  Roble phase material is found on or around the earlier buildings. Unlike the  case at Site PVN 306, however, there were no late burials associated with Site  PVN 128’s Terminal Classic constructions. Whatever connections might have  been made between Site PVN 144’s occupants and the ruins lying 250 m away,  they did not apparently involve treating the latter as final resting places for the  former. Naco’s architectural core was also situated near major construction dat- ing to the Terminal Classic. The extensive modifications made to Naco and  its environs by colonial and later occupation stretching into the present make  it difficult to ascertain the nature and scale of architecture here dating to any  prehistoric span. At least one center composed of seven edifices up to 2.5 m  207 </page> <page sequence="6"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y Figure 9.2 Map of Site PVN 128, a Terminal Classic center in the Naco valley tall and grouped around two plazas, however, lies on the west border of the  Roble phase center and seems to have survived the last prehistoric centu- ries intact (Site PVN 99; figure 9.1). Limited test excavations on two of the  monumental platforms at Site PVN 99, however, revealed no burials dating  to any span. 208 </page> <page sequence="7"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y Such juxtapositions between late and earlier political centers could, of  course, be fortuitous. The physical criteria that must have been met to sup- port moderately large settlements in both the Terminal Classic and the Roble  phase were much the same, for example easy access to flat, fertile land and a  year-round supply of water. It is not surprising, therefore, that populations  continued to cluster in the same spots throughout the Naco valley’s long pre- history; in fact, evidence of occupation at Sites PVN 306, PVN 128, PVN 99,  and Naco reaches well back into the Preclassic and continues without apparent  break through at least the Terminal Classic. What is surprising is that later oc- cupants did not directly reoccupy or do noticeable damage to structures raised  by their predecessors. It is as though Terminal Classic edifices were preserved,  unmodified, as monuments to a past deemed important by at least some Late  Postclasssic population segments. How widespread this reverence was among  the occupants of Sites PVN 306, PVN 144, and Naco is not clear. Elites very  likely numbered themselves among those who respected their predecessors, as  they would have had the power to either raze earlier buildings or restrain their  followers from pillaging these ruins. It is also noteworthy that this apparent celebration of the past was highly  selective. Roble phase people consciously chose to erect their centers near cer- tain, but not all, sizable Terminal Classic settlements. They apparently avoided  the largest of the earlier centers, La Sierra, which had been the valley’s capital  during the Late Classic and remained a major political and population center  into the Terminal Classic (Schortman and Urban 2004b). Linkages were made  between specific sets of Roble phase magnates and what was recalled about  particular Terminal Classic political foci and, presumably, their leaders. The lines of evidence outlined here imply that Terminal Classic construc- tions at Sites PVN 306, PVN 144, and possibly Naco were held in some regard  by these settlements’ late prehistoric inhabitants. At the very least, they did not  pillage them or treat the buildings as trash receptacles. In fact, the ruined edi- fices of this earlier period were sufficiently important that Roble phase centers  were raised near but not over large-scale Terminal Classic platforms. This rela- tionship is clearest at Site PVN 306, where the preeminent household estab- lished its residences and seat of power adjoining a concentration of Terminal  Classic buildings. The burial of some members of the Site PVN 306’s Roble  phase population around Terminal Classic platforms provides even stronger  evidence that connections between the past and the present were explicitly  drawn. The same direct linkages to antecedent events and personages were  made less explicitly, or at least not in quite the same ways, at Site PVN 144 and  Naco. Still, in all cases the decision to raise Roble phase political capitals near  prominent monuments to Terminal Classic leadership and to preserve those  expressions of power intact strongly implies that late prehistoric elites were  209 </page> <page sequence="8"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y drawing their predecessors into a network focused on themselves. We are not  certain how this connection was imagined by rulers and ruled. The fact that it  existed and was important to substantiate the former’s claims to preeminence  in the fourteenth through early sixteenth centuries seems clear, however. reachiNg iNto the Past with style Analysis of 14,018 Naco Viejo Ceramic Complex pottery sherds from Sites  PVN 306 and PVN 144 revealed an assemblage marked by considerable cultural  continuity with the basin’s ceramic tradition reaching back into the Middle  Preclassic. Changes in pottery forms and designs, as well as in other categories  of material culture, certainly occurred, but the shifts do not constitute dramatic  disjunctions. Instead, the sequence is characterized by a gradual unfolding of  stylistic, formal, and technological themes likely reflecting stable populations  and evolving cultural understandings and practices. The most dramatic shifts  in ceramic decoration and form are represented by the red-on-white–painted  bichromes discussed in chapters 1 and 8. Even in this case, however, designs of  clear foreign inspiration were synthesized with locally derived motifs to create  symbols that couched foreign concepts in familiar terms. This incorporation  of exotic motifs within a local decorative repertoire was fairly common in the  Naco valley ceramic sequence. The red-on-white–painted bichromes, there- fore, do not necessarily constitute a disjunction in local populations or in basic  principles of pottery decoration but instead are part of a venerable tradition of  design syncretism within the Naco valley (Wonderley 1986). What is striking about the Naco valley’s Roble phase ceramics are the as- semblage’s relative simplicity and its harkening back to surface treatments that  had not been common in the basin since the Late Preclassic. Red slipping, a  prevalent form of decoration during the Middle and Late Preclassic, had all but  disappeared during the Classic period but was once again frequently attested  to in Roble phase collections (Urban 1993a). A comparable shift is recorded  in the Maya lowlands, where red slipping follows a similar temporal trajec- tory (Masson 2001; Rice 1983). Vertical-neck jars with direct rims that had  been relatively common during the Preclassic also underwent a resurgence in  the Late Postclassic. This form is exceedingly rare in Classic period Naco val- ley assemblages, where jars tend to have either flaring necks or vertical necks  with pronounced everted rims. Restricted orifice jars (tecomates) are relatively  common in Preclassic Naco deposits but do not reappear in later collections.  Somewhat smaller bowls with in-curving walls resemble these tecomates and  do constitute a significant proportion of Roble phase forms in several taxa.  Once again, such neckless forms characterized by restricted orifices are rarely  attested to in Classic period assemblages. 210 </page> <page sequence="9"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y This is not to say that Roble phase ceramics are indistinguishable from  their Late Preclassic counterparts. Decorative treatments such as brushing and  red painting on white-slipped surfaces are distinctive of pottery vessels made in  the basin during the last two prehistoric centuries. In addition, such append- ages as hollow supports in the form of bird feet or heads are diagnostic of the  Roble phase. Nevertheless, the similarities between Preclassic and Roble phase  ceramics are remarkable, especially given the more than 1,000 years separating  the two periods. The significance of these commonalities to those who made  and used the vessels is unclear. It is hard to imagine that Roble phase potters  recalled traditions dating back to before AD 200 and consciously revived them.  Such attributes as red slipping may have been adopted from lowland Maya  populations involved in their own program of reviving Late Preclassic decora- tive modes (Masson 2000b: 44–45, 47; 2001; Rice 1983). If so, what seems to  have been a reversion to earlier decorative attributes was merely the adoption  of treatments from neighboring populations, with similarities to earlier Naco  valley treatments simply fortuitous. Such an explanation still begs the question  of why these innovations would have been so readily and widely accepted.  Whether autochthonously developed or borrowed from afar, the widespread  use of such attributes as red slips implies that they resonated positively with  all segments of the Naco valley’s Roble phase population. This resonance was  almost certainly rooted in memories associated with certain ceramic designs.  It may be, however, that the primary factors motivating changes in ceramic  forms and treatments had less to do with what was recalled fondly concerning  Preclassic pottery and more to do with negative associations linked to Classic  period ceramic designs and treatments. On a general level, it seems that the Naco valley’s Roble phase inhabitants  were eschewing certain prominent ceramic modes associated with the Late and  Terminal Classic. Specifically, orange slipping of open bowls, the painting of  those vessels in red and red-and-black designs, and the fashioning of large jars  whose shoulders and vertical necks were adorned with red-painted designs of  avian and geometric forms are characteristic of the earlier periods but com- pletely absent from the Roble phase ceramic repertoire (Urban 1993a). We  are confronted, therefore, with a seeming contradiction. On the one hand,  prominent members of Roble phase populations in the Naco valley were asso- ciating themselves with the remains of Terminal Classic political leaders. At the  same time, however, any such connections were actively denied in the ceramic  containers used by all of the basin’s late prehistoric occupants. The distinctive  symbols painted on jars and bowls by those who lived in Terminal Classic  polities were replaced by a novel set of images that, while drawing inspiration  from past examples, still diverged from their predecessors in form and manner  of execution. This disjunction in the way architecture and ceramics dating to  211 </page> <page sequence="10"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y the Terminal Classic were treated strongly indicates that the views of the past  entertained by Roble phase peoples in the Naco valley were conflicted. What these conflicts might have entailed depends on what the symbols  emblazoned on Late and Terminal Classic vessels meant to the basin’s Roble  phase denizens. We have argued elsewhere that during the Late Classic, one  particularly salient component of that earlier design repertoire, the bird, was  closely linked with a hierarchically structured network that tied together all  residents of the valley and was focused on elites who ruled from the site of La  Sierra (Schortman, Urban, and Ausec 2001). During the succeeding Terminal  Classic, the same bird continues to appear on pottery as well as, much more  rarely, in stone sculpture. The Late Classic was a period of locally unprece- dented political centralization in which those who resided in La Sierra’s site  core concentrated power over populations within and immediately outside the  valley in their own hands. During the Terminal Classic, power fragmented.  While La Sierra remained an important political and population center, its  magnates now shared the stage with numerous elites who could also commis- sion large-scale constructions. The occupants of Sites PVN 99, PVN 128, and  PVN 306 were among those whose usurpation of power contributed to the  decentralization of the Late Classic La Sierra realm. The continued importance  of the same avian imagery during these political transformations implies that  the significance attributed to this motif changed. The bird may have origi- nally symbolized a unified domain and the elites who ruled it. As this imagery  survived the balkanization of that polity, new power holders likely strove to  preserve some sense of valley-wide unity, even if it was no longer focused on a  specific ruling house. However these relations may have played out, it is clear that increasing  diversity and elaboration of ceramic designs in the Late and Terminal Classic  Naco valley correlated closely with major political shifts (see also Masson 2001:  161–162). Significant transformations within network structures were involved  in these changes, but throughout the seventh through tenth centuries, ceramic  designs were implicated in the creation of hierarchically organized webs that  encompassed the entire basin and its environs. By the eleventh century, clear  signs of such hierarchical formations had disappeared from the Naco valley;  monumental constructions were not erected during the Early Postclassic, nor  is there any evidence of population nucleation. The Early Postclassic pottery  assemblage underwent dramatic simplification; its vessels were virtually un- decorated, although there is strong continuity in forms (Urban 1993a). As  hierarchical nets were reestablished in the Roble phase, older designs were  not resurrected to express inequality. Something about the messages conveyed  through Late and Terminal Classic symbols emblazoned on ceramics was no  longer considered appropriate. As noted in chapter 8, references were still made  212 </page> <page sequence="11"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y to birds in the Nolasco/La Victoria Bichromes, but the form of the bird had  changed, as had its location on the outside of bowls and as supports for those  containers. These oblique references to avian images may have safely recalled  links to past concepts without conjuring up meanings tied to specific Late and  Terminal Classic rulers or forms of governance. The shift to earlier forms of pottery decoration, therefore, might not rep- resent a conscious evocation of clearly remembered Late Preclassic lifestyles and  organizational forms. It may instead express a disavowal of political concepts  and arrangements explicitly embodied in Late and Terminal Classic ceramic  designs. As Roble phase rulers refashioned a polity-wide identity (see chapter  8), they cautiously revived avian imagery but transformed it sufficiently so  as to recall a general sense of past affiliations shorn of their associations with  older ruling houses. Distinctive vessel forms, such as the high vertical-necked  jars with everted rims, that had been canvases for so many Late and Terminal  Classic design displays, along with other motifs tied to the earlier bird images,  were dropped from the Roble phase repertoire. They may have been too closely  associated with the political messages conveyed in avian form to survive in the  new contexts. The decision to revert to red slipping as the primary means of  decoration could therefore simply reflect a desire to avoid any overt reference  to symbols that evoked memories of particular forms of hierarchy and power.  The similarity between Roble phase and Preclassic assemblages would, in this  view, result from an accidental convergence of approaches to vessel treatments  based largely on the limited array of materials available in the valley for fash- ioning and decorating pottery containers. The changes in ceramic assemblages outlined here are matched by compa- rable shifts in most aspects of material culture. Mold-made, fired clay whistles,  figurines, and ocarinas that assumed a variety of anthropomorphic and zoo- morphic forms were commonplace throughout the Naco valley during the Late  and Terminal Classic (figure 9.3). These effigies disappear completely from  the archaeological record by the Early Postclassic. When figurines reappeared  in the Roble phase, they assumed radically different forms and were not ex- plicitly associated with musical instruments (see figure 8.6). Incense burners  also underwent drastic transformations. The variety of three-prong, modeled,  ladle, and complex incensarios that characterized the basin’s Late and Terminal  Classic collections was reduced by the Roble phase to tube-handled ladle cen- sers and, very rarely, spiked bowls (figures 9.3 and 9.4). Candeleros, flat-topped  ceramic forms with one to more than twenty-four conical holes punched into  their tops, also disappeared after the end of the Terminal Classic, as did ceramic  stamps used for decorating cloth and human skin and such jewelry as clay  pendants and ear spools. These shifts bespeak profound transformations in a  variety of behavioral arenas, from personal adornment to ritual. The refusal to  213 </page> <page sequence="12"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y Figure 9.3 Examples of candeleros (a, c), incensarios (b, d), and figurines (e, f ) dating to  the Late and Terminal Classic in the Naco valley revive these artifact forms during the fourteenth through early sixteenth centu- ries also indicates that the basin’s denizens were uninterested in re-engaging in  the activities in which these objects had played integral parts. It is as if most of  Terminal Classic Naco valley life was blotted out from memory even as hierar- chically structured social forms were reconstituted in the Roble phase. suMMary The Naco valley’s Roble phase rulers confronted the same problem all would- be leaders face; that is, how to make their pretensions to power seem like parts  of a timeless and unchanging universe rather than the machinations of en- 214 </page> <page sequence="13"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y Figure 9.4 Examples of Roble phase tube-handle ladle incensarios from test excavations  conducted in Naco terprising agents taking advantage of opportunities offered by particular mo- ments in time. To achieve this objective, these rulers had to build networks that  connected them to previous notables and notable events. By their very nature,  the recollections on which those webs were founded would have been partial  and selective. Operating outside even the flexible constraints of written docu- ments concerning the past, what any occupant of the Roble phase Naco valley  remembered about his or her history was likely heavily influenced by current  215 </page> <page sequence="14"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y concerns and understandings. Elites, however, layered onto the various factors  that condition recall their own conscious desires to privilege themselves within  novel political relations. Building networks into the past, therefore, very much  required shaping social memory (Alcock 2000, 2005; Bloch 1977a, 1977b;  Casey 1987; Schank and Abelson 1995). To say the least, this is not an easy job. Earlier events and personages can  be deeply problematic for those seeking to restructure sociopolitical relations  in the present. Whereas some figures and happenings can provide powerful  rationalizations for hierarchical political structures, others may evoke negative  associations that could lead to questions about the wisdom of such arrange- ments and the motivations and fitness to rule of those promoting them. Thus  highlighting certain features of history and ensuring particular interpretations  of those features require simultaneously forgetting other aspects and repressing  alternative views. Both processes can be glimpsed in operation within the Roble phase  Naco valley. On the one hand, elites strove to link themselves with aspects  of Terminal Classic rulership. This interval was, from the perspective of the  basin’s fourteenth-century inhabitants, the most recent period in which there  were moderately well-defined hierarchical social formations. By raising their  paramount households close to the ruins of Terminal Classic power centers,  leaders at Naco and Sites PVN 306 and PVN 144 were apparently making  claims to some association with the hierarchical formations those settlements  represented. The care taken to leave the earlier sites intact and unencumbered  by late prehistoric occupation further testifies to the regard in which Terminal  Classic monumental buildings were held by elites at least. The ties thus forged  are clearest at Site PVN 306, where not only was the paramount elite house- hold established only 3 m west of the settlement’s Terminal Classic eastern fo- cus but some members of the Roble phase population were buried around these  earlier edifices. It is not at all clear that those interred in the eastern Terminal  Classic aggregate were members of the social group that resided in the EPP.  The simple form of the uncovered burials would, in fact, argue against such a  view. While we do not know who was laid to rest in the environs of Site PVN  306’s Terminal Classic buildings, this burial practice strongly implies a close  connection between at least some segment(s) of the settlement’s Roble phase  population and whatever was represented by Terminal Classic architecture. At the same time selected features of the Terminal Classic were remem- bered positively, at least by late prehistoric elites, others were clearly not viewed  in such a manner. Specifically, Roble phase potters assiduously avoided dis- tinctive symbols emblazoned on pottery vessels and tied to aspects of Late  and Terminal Classic rule. So complete was this disavowal of decorative mo- tifs and their referents that certain vessel forms, such as vertical, high-necked  216 </page> <page sequence="15"> N e two r k s  a N d  s o c i a l  M e M o r y jars with everted rims, prominently associated with the earlier symbol system,  disappeared altogether. Decorated types, specifically red-on-white–painted bi- chromes, did constitute a consistent minority of Roble phase assemblages. The  forms in which they most commonly appeared (tripod bowls), the serpent  motifs that adorned them, and the mode of rendering these designs together  constitute a marked departure from Late and Terminal Classic precedents.  Even as late prehistoric magnates sought to use ceramics to forge polity-wide  identities, they avoided explicit references to symbols employed in similar ef- forts four centuries and more before. Despite the fact that we lack a clear idea  of what the motifs involved meant to those who used them, it is obvious that  Terminal Classic designs were anathema to Roble phase rulers and, presum- ably, their supporters. We cannot say at this point what Terminal Classic figures and events were  incorporated in the nets constructed by Roble phase elites. From their selective  use of architecture and aspects of pottery design, however, we can infer that  the process of casting history in the service of present concerns was a creative  one. Certain aspects of the relatively recent past were embraced, while others  were hidden firmly from view. In the process much was forgotten, and that  which was recalled was almost certainly reinterpreted in ways that made sense  in, and served the interests of, networks operating in the Naco valley during  the fourteenth through early sixteenth centuries.
