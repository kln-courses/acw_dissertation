<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE 381 Bryan Talbot presented an archive of anthropomorphic images, while Paul Gravett unearthed a genuine curio in the largely forgotten Herbie (a short, fat, and pubescent superhero, the “Fat Fury”). There was no sustained engagement with Francophone or East Asian comics and animation, surely more fruitful ground for both sf and Surrealism (think of Möebius and Mamoru Oshii as two obvious examples). More effort also could have been made to connect Surrealist diffusions to contemporary sf, such as the pseudo-Dadaist prose of Steve Aylett or the generic monstrosities of China Miéville (both have worked in comics). This was very much a curate’s egg of a conference, fascinating and frustrating, whose omissions one hopes will be covered in a subsequent publication project.—Tony Venezia, Birkbeck College, University of London 2011 SFS Symposium/Eaton Conference. The double bill of the third SFS Symposium and the 2011 Eaton Conference inspires, first and foremost, academic thoughts, but I would like to begin by noting that moving both events to February was an idea that deserves applause. While I am sure that the participants all came for intellectual nourishment and social networking, the opportunity to bask in the California sun before, after, and during the breaks in the program—at a time when many places from which they came were winter- ridden—enhanced the general atmosphere in no small measure. The same can be said about the venue. With the exception of the Friday afternoon plenary session held at UCR’s Culver Center for the Arts, all events took place in the Mission Inn Hotel and Spa in Riverside, a historic building famous in Riverside and Southern California but, viewed from a fantastic perspective, also a place whose structure, layout, and decor bring to mind the images of Gibson’s “Gothic folly” and Gaudi-esque architectural surreality.  As in 2009, the SFS Symposium served as a prelude, an initiatory but no less intellectually stimulating event. Entitled “The Singularity in SF Literature and Theory” and announced by a very impressively-designed flyer/poster, the symposium was held on Thursday, February 10, and featured three speakers. In his “Singularities,” Neil Easterbrook suggested that among the three S’s that have dominated science fiction for some time—slipstream, steampunk, and singularity—the last one seems to be the most precise and yet, as he ventured to demonstrate, the most ambiguous. Consequently, his presentation sketched out various understandings of the term: technological, cultural, psychological, and textual. Brooks Landon’s “The Light at the End of the Tunnel: The Plurality of Singularity” also stressed plural conceptions of the term but explored the territories closer to the field of sf studies: Kurzweil’s concept of accelerating change, Vinge’s metaphor of the opaque wall around the future, and nanotechnology, which was mentioned repeatedly. In “From Outer Space to Inner Space: New Wave Science Fiction and the Singularity,” Rob Latham took the discussion towards the discourses of literary history, suggesting that the New Wave could be considered a genre singularity but also concluding that the intra- sf revolution of the 1960s failed to reboot science fiction as a field.  The Eaton Science Fiction Conference kicked off on Friday morning, February 11, and for the next two days the participants could choose among thirty-six sessions and close to a hundred papers by presenters from the US, </page> <page sequence="2"> 382 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Russia, Germany, Italy, France, Finland, Korea, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Poland. This diversity was appropriate given the theme of the conference: “Global Science Fiction.” Apart from the explorations of various aspects of trans-, cross-, and multi-nationalism as well as colonialism, neocolonialism, and postcolonialism in Anglophone science fictions, papers and sessions examined such topics as Orientalism, African- American sf, Chinese sf, Euro-American encounters, Mexican and South American sf, and Polish sf.  Listing the most interesting presentations would take up more space than assigned for this report, but one conclusion is inescapable: the days of conceptualizing sf as an Anglo-American (plus Verne) literary project are long gone. Even though there is so much sf that we have yet to hear about, the conference’s program showed the genre to be a truly global phenomenon, crossing territorial, linguistic, and ideological boundaries and engaging a dazzling array of imagined futures. The international scope of the conference was also strongly embodied in the roster of guest writers, whose identities and work in numerous ways exemplify sf’s globality: Nalo Hopkinson, China Miéville, and Karen Tei Yamashita. Predictably, all three had an opportunity to listen to papers devoted to their own work. No disagreements or fights between the writers and their interpreters were recorded.  The paper sessions were supplemented by other events such as the Science Fiction Poetry Association’s poetry reading and open mike and the screening of Dreams with Sharp Teeth, a documentary devoted to Harlan Ellison. Friday afternoon highlights were the keynote address by UC Riverside’s Mike Davis, a critic and writer much loved in sf circles for his studies of the contemporary world, who gave a moving tribute to his late friend, sf author Ward Moore; the panel discussion on global sf, moderated by Rob Latham and involving Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr., and the three guest writers Nalo Hopkinson, China Miéville, and Karen Tei Yamashita; and the J. Lloyd Eaton Lifetime Award presentations. This year, two awards were given—to Samuel R. Delany for 2010, and to Harlan Ellison for 2011. For health reasons, neither recipient was able to attend, but both sent letters to be read by their appointed proxies.  To say that the SFS Symposium and the Eaton Conference were a success is an understatement. The conference directors, Melissa Conway and Rob Latham, did such a splendid job of putting together a conference of that size and scope that it is hard to imagine an event that will trump it. More importantly, it is events like this, however rare they may be, that demonstrate science-fiction studies to be not only an intensely international and polyvocal field but also one that is truly welcoming and collegial.—Paweł Frelik, MCSU, Lublin, Poland.  Correction. In the critical bibliography attached to my introduction to the slipstream special issue (March 2011), I mistakenly attributed the SFS review of Feeling Very Strange: The Slipstream Anthology to Paweł Frelik; it was actually written by Doug Davis. The error has been corrected on our website, but I wanted to make sure it was noted here as well. My apologies to Paweł and Doug.— Rob Latham, SFS </page> </plain_text>
