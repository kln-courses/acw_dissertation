<plain_text><page sequence="1">CATHOLIC MODERNISM AND CATHOLIC DOGMA CATHOLIC MODERNISM AND CATHOLIC DOGMA JOHN T. McNEILL, D.B. Chicago, Illinois Although the movement in the Roman Catholic church known as Modernisn received its name in a Papal Encyclical of 1907, and officially perished with the issue of a Papal Motu Proprio of 19IO, it can by no means be histori- cally confined within these dates. The tendencies to which it gave tangible expression are in fact increasingly dis- cernible in koman Catholicism from the era of the French Revolution. It would be a mistaken description of Modernism that would connect it with twelfth- or sixteenth-century radicals like Abelard or Giordano Bruno. Such individualists are nearer to the spirit of liberal Prot- estantism, with its indifference to the idea of a Catholic church. The Modern- ists are essentially Catholic, and it is in the name and spirit of Catholicism that they challenge the papacy. They are also essentially modern, as is shown in their respect for science, in their historic criti- cism, and in their democratic principles. The Genesis of Modernism The Modernist spirit derives in some degree from the democratic revival of the French Revolution era. Revo- lution sentiment powerfully affected the church in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Early French Ultramontanism was possessed of the exhilarating hope of a democratized Catholicism. This liberal or moderniz- ing tendency was represented by in- fluential personalities like Montalembert and Lamennais. The latter, once a</page><page sequence="2">508 THE BIBLICAL WORLD strong candidate for a cardinalate, sub- sequently left the church for the sake of greater intellectual freedom. The reactionism of Pius IX (1846-78), espe- cially the Roman Decrees of 1854 and the Vatican Council of 1870, depressed and discouraged, but did not extirpate, Catholic liberalism. Among opponents of the reactionary papal tendency two men outside of France stand out with great prominence. Neither Newman nor D6llinger was invited to attend the Vatican Council. Both were distressed by the Vatican decrees, but each met the new situation in his own way. D6llinger refused to submit to the new claims and became the leader of a homeless sect which he hoped would form the rallying-ground for the institution of a true Catholicism. In so doing he was no Modernist. The Old Catholic movement which he re- organized was more an effort to revert to patristic models than one to meet changing world-conditions. Newman, on the other hand, who had sought the Roman church as a harbor for his soul, was not to be set adrift again even by painful disillusion- ment. He swallowed the new dogmas as best he could and remained a loyal though not unsuspected Catholic. At the same time he held to opinions on the development of dogma and on the subject of authority which were quite out of tune with the tendencies of the increasingly reactionary and autocratic papacy. George Tyrrell, in his spirited reply to Cardinal Mercier (Mediaevalism, p. 95), while applauding the courage and single-mindedness of D6llinger, assures his opponent that he was "less of a Modernist than Newman." But Newman was never more than a beginner in the field of criticism. As the criticism of the Bible and of ecclesiastical history developed in the course of the century, it was inevitable that the Roman church would sooner or later face the theological problems which criticism raised. One of the foremost Catholic historians of the period, Louis Duchesne, became pro- fessor of church history in the Catholic Institute at Paris in the year of the death of Pius IX (1878). A sincere critical historian, he gave to Catholic students interpretations of church de- velopment that were truthful and sur- prising. Alfred Loisy, a pupil of Duchesne, joined the staff of the In- stitute in i88i as professor of Hebrew. During a fruitful professorship of twelve years Loisy carried the critical methods of history into his lectures on Bible subjects. In 1893 he was forced to resign, and the Pope's Encyclical Pro- videntissimus Deus condemned higher criticism, stating that the canonical books were inspired in such a way as to "exclude all error." But the position of Leo XIII on advanced thought within the church was compromised by the fact that he had been induced to lend his favor to the "Union pour l'action morale," a group which proposed radical social reforms and embraced others than Catholics within its membership. Leo never committed himself to stringent policies of repression. While he dis- ciplined or deprived individual teachers, encouraged in his Encyclical Aeterni Patris the revival of scholastic philos- ophy, and wrote to Cardinal Gibbons deploring free tendencies in America,</page><page sequence="3">CATHOLIC MODERNISM AND CATHOLIC DOGMA 509 yet he never set about a general program for the extirpation of Modernism. Development and Suppression of Modernism The pontificate of Pius X (1903-14) marks the rapid development and the official suppression of Modernism. "The Unknown Pope," as he was called at the time of his election, soon became known as a determined reactionary. Loisy's chief works were immediately placed on the Index; and the same fate befell the mass of Modernist writings which now appeared in rapid succession. Laberthonniere, Hutin, and Le Roy in France, Tyrrell and von Hiigel in England, Schell and Schnitzer in Ger- many, and an Italian group headed by Fogazzaro the novelist and Dom Romolo Murri, toward whom the Pope is said to have cherished an early personal antipathy, became, with Loisy, the marked objects of the papal counter- attack. The Decree Lamentabili of July, 1907, listed 65 heresies of the new school. It was followed in September of that year by the now historic Encyc- lical Pascendi Domini gregis, in which the name "Modernist," already in use among Jesuit writers, was attached to the movement as a badge of dishonor. The document is astutely argumentative, but it prescribes other means than argu- ment to secure the overthrow of the movement-censorship, vigilance com- mittees, espionage, and all the parapher- nalia of bloodless repression. Courageous and able protests were made against the Encyclical, notably by Tyrrell, whose reply took the form of a letter to the London Times. The Pro- gramme of Modernism was the remon- strance of an anonymous group; the Italian original was soon translated into English by Tyrrell. As the Encyclical had only aroused in- stead of silencing the Modernist leaders, severer treatment was now to be ac- corded them. The papacy took ad- vantage of the avowed refusal of the Modernists to participate in a schism. Even those who like Loisy and Murri had been excommunicated were still professing their loyalty to the church. This unconditional fidelity could be traded upon. The demand was now presented, in the Motu Proprio, Sacrorum antistitum, that an oath disavowing Modernist views and promising to support the Encyclical and other anti- Modernist measures should be taken by all professors and ordinands. The oath was taken, with few exceptions. But many Modernists declared in mak- ing their submission that the act was merely formal and morally invalid. At the same time the allied Christian Social movement of France, with the Sillon as its organ, was suppressed (1910). The Philosophy of Modernism Although Modernism arose, as its leaders repeatedly insist, not out of philosophical speculation but out of historical criticism, still it may be said to possess a set of philosophical prin- ciples which are characteristic of the whole movement. In the Encyclical these principles are adversely stated to be founded on agnosticism. This word is inaccurately used to describe the Modernist revolt against external views of revelation and the assured intellectualism of the Angelic Doctor.</page><page sequence="4">510 THE BIBLICAL WORLD The leading philosopher of Modern- ism is Lucien Laberthonniere. He drew his ideas partly from M. Blondel, who in the nineties advocated an apologetic based on immanence. Laberthonniere brings a new perspective to the old prob- lem of reality. He dissociates himself both from sensationalists and from idealists. He criticizes both the agnos- tics who regard reality as beyond knowl- edge, and the intellectual dogmatists who import, into the phenomenal, ideas to which they give ontological value. Sensation and thought are not separately capable of bringing us to reality. The knowledge of reality involves a moral activity to which sensation and thought are alike ancillary. Life does not pas- sively receive truth; it actively con- stitutes it. Through the moral will man obtains the certainty of God. But this is possible, not because God is apart from man, but because he is in man. Laber- thonniere protects his doctrine of im- manence against pantheism. God is the inspirer, and God is the prize of life-- the end toward which human endeavor tends. God has reality without man as well as in man. "Just as we affirm ourselves freely by Him, so He by us freely affirms Himself; yet with this difference, that we if we willed to affirm ourselves without Him would lose our- selves, while He could affirm Himself without us and yet lose nothing of the fulness of His being." Thus the affirma- tion of reality becomes a moral act; and every such act has a moral value pro- portional to the indwelling in the human agent of the immanent God. Truth therefore is never a static quantity but always dynamic and relative. Each truth affirmed, being vitally related to life itself, becomes a starting-point for new moral ventures, each harvest of truth but seed for a new sowing. The Programme of Modernism is anxious to refute the charge of agnos- ticism. Spencer's conception of the Unknowable is repudiated by the Mod- ernists. The view of knowledge as a function of activity, a view derived from the results of science and psychology, breaks down " the fictitious barriers between thought and will" of scholastic philosophy and really results in vastly extending the area of the Knowable. There exist in the human spirit other powers than the argumentative reason, and powers no less reliable for attaining truth. The writers deny the novelty of their principle of vital immanence, traced in the Encyclical to modern Protestant thought. They cite New- man, Augustine, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and use the words of Aquinas himself that "a natural desire can never be a delusion." Even the Vatican definitions cited in the Encyclical in condemnation of Modernism are shown to bear the interpretation of immanence. Immanentism leads the Modernists to an altogether untraditional respect for the non-Christian religions, and accordingly they are charged in the Encyclical with admitting that "all religions are true." The position really taken is that the ethnic faiths are relatively beneficial, as representing a moral advance on the environment in which they arose. Their relation to Christianity is that of the less perfect to the more perfect. Arguments are freely drawn from the fathers of the Logos theology in support of the Modernist contention. Did not Justin</page><page sequence="5">CATHOLIC MODERNISM AND CATHOLIC DOGMA 511 recognize the truth of the Stoic doctrine of the Logos Spermatikos, and so regard as Christians those who in former times lived according to the Logos, like Socrates, Heraclitus, and Abraham ? The Evolution of Dogma The Modernists have closely observed the history of the formulation of the dogmas of the church, applying to the subject the methods and hypotheses of genetic historical study. To them dog- ma has no aspect of finality, but rather the aspect of continuous evolution, reflecting the evolving forms of life itself. Loisy, the keenest of the Mod- ernist biblical critics, has perhaps most clearly expressed this conception. In Autour d'un Petit Livre, a sheaf of letters to French churchmen in defense of positions taken in his former work, L'?vangile et l'Vglise, he traces the evolu- tion of Christology from the resurrection to Chalcedon (pp. 119-29). That Chris- tology was not explicitly, formally, and authoritatively taught (p. 156) but pro- gressively wrought out in theological travail. The actual consciousness of Jesus largely escapes the historian. Tra- dition plays a decisive part in the for- mulation of his teaching in the New Testament as well as in the Fathers. The Christology develops from the Jew- ish messianic conception, with its under- lying ideas of predestination and of the unique part of the Messiah. But "le Christ historique, dans l'humanite de son 'service' est assez grand pour justifier la Christologie, et la Christologie n'est pas besoin d'avoir ete enseignee expresse- ment par Jesus pour &amp;tre vraie." Modernism is careful to repudiate all connection with liberal Protestantism in asserting these positions. Indeed Loisy's tvangile is a rather severe critique of Harnack's Das Wesen des Christentums. He criticizes Harnack for taking a portion of the reported teaching of Jesus and making it absolute, while it is really to be regarded as all tradi- tional and relative. The Modernists do not seek a new basis for dogma by dis- criminating in detail between genuine and interpolated elements in the teach- ing ascribed to Jesus. Instead they would conserve all church dogma but put it all through a process of reinter- pretation as an expression of the reli- gious life of the centuries through which it was given form. Tyrrell in Chris- tianity at the Crossroads is equally concerned to distinguish between the "liberal" subjective methods and the Modernist conservation of dogmatic values. On the other hand Modernism rebels against the Scholastic domination. Tyr- rell is able to show Cardinal Mercier that "history with its revelations of the evolution of Scripture, Hierarchy, and Dogma, has shattered the synthesis of Scholastic theology." The value of dogma is the value of the living facts which it represents, and depends not on the form but on the spirit. Tyrrell makes an example of the Athanasian Creed as follows: "If in the Athanasian Creed the words, 'This is the Catholic Faith which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved,' referred, as they seem, to the foregoing theological analysis, they would be ridiculous. Their only toler- able sense is, 'This is the analysis of the Catholic Faith, of those facts and truths by which a man must live (or</page><page sequence="6">512 THE BIBLICAL WORLD of that supernatural world in which he must live) if he is to be saved."' Thus the Modernist sets himself free from the letter of dogma into the spirit of it. The Catholic faith is something superior and antecedent to its expression in dogma. Dogma is implicit in Catholic Christianity and is evolved by it in the course of history. Again he remarks: "What is characteristically Christian and Catholic in the lives of the greatest saints . . .. obtained among the Apostles and first disciples of Christ generations before the said complexities were called into existence." It seems open to question whether the framers of the Athanasian Creed would be satisfied with such an interpre- tation of their words. The Fathers of the church in the age of the great creeds were not Modernists, and "high" inter- pretations of dogma were the rule among them. The framers of creeds as a rule were interested, not in making a synthesis of experience, but in dealing blows at theological opponents. They not infrequently showed a disposition to bind the believer to the letter. It is admittedly a distinct spiritual advan- tage to free one's self from the letter of an exacting creed while yet deriving a positive value from it, even by the use of a rather fanciful interpretation of history. But there are sure to be those who will gain more by rejecting some elements of dogma outright-elements which history does not show to be naturally formulated group beliefs, but to partake of party spleenfulness. It is not only the form but the spirit of such portions of dogma that is to be criticized. Still the Modernists are seeking to do for their church an inestimable service. It is nothing less than to cure it of that disease which Fogazzaro has diag- nosed as "the spirit of immobility." And it is because the conception of vital immanence accords so well with the historical view of dogma that Modernism puts the papacy into a panic. It has a doctrine of life by which the historical critique is sup- ported. The decree Lamentabili exhib- its the hysteria of the Vatican in the insult to historical science contained in No. 39 of its list of Modernist errors. Here the position is condemned that "the opinions concerning the origin of the sacraments with which the fathers of Trent were imbued, and which cer- tainly influenced their dogmatic canons, are very different from those which now rightly obtain among historians who ex- amine into Christianity." Rome shrinks from the historical as well as from the philosophical argument. The Function of Dogma These views on the development of dogma are accompanied by explicit statements regarding its function in religion today. Among the epithets used in the Encyclical Pascendi to portray Modernism in fearsome colors for the warning of the faithful is the phrase "the synthesis of all heresies." Yet the Modernists without exception avow their acceptance of the whole body of ecclesiastical dogma and have testified to their sincerity in this by refusing to be driven into schism. The real grievance is that they understand by dogma something new and strange, something spiritual rather than formal, springing from life and issuing in life. Le Roy in his Dogme et</page><page sequence="7">CATHOLIC MODERNISM AND CATHOLIC DOGMA 513 Critique has presented the Modernist view of the function of dogma. To Le Roy dogma is not a cage for thought but a practical aid to religious life. It is to be interpreted in no absolute sense but adapted to the needs of life. Many of the terms used in the familiar church dogmas are metaphorical and "inconvertible into concepts." Thus the idea of the personality of God if defined yields anthropomorphism; if undefined it results in agnosticism. But if taken not as absolute truth but as a practical direction for life, the dogma of God's personality enjoins behavior toward God like right behavior toward known persons. Similarly the doctrine of the real presence, while not capable of rationalization, may suggest the atti- tude of spirit one would take if Christ were visibly present. Thus the primary use of dogma is as a guide to practical conduct. While it is easy to see how dogma may be so interpreted as to serve the practical uses here suggested, the actual result of such a process is not quite what Le Roy asserts. What has actu- ally been done is not so much to make dogma a guide to the practice of religion as to make the practice of religion a guide to dogma-to explain the unde- termined value of dogma by the recog- nized values of practice. Surely if dogma is to have any religious value it must have some theological value, since it has been formulated as a compendium of accepted theology. Le Roy does not deny it this value but regards it as entirely secondary. The Anglican Modernist A. L. Lilley describes the Modernist attitude as denying that dogma is the mathematical sum of truths. Instead Modernism asserts that dogma is "a body of truth fashioned by the soul of truth which inhabits it." It does not concern itself with the defense of dogmas per se but seeks to connect them with religion itself. "Modernism rejects no dogma, but transforms all." Tyrrell empha- sizes the religious value of dogma for minds informed by science. They can still find "a mystical Christ, crucified in the Eucharist, in the chalice the sufferings . . . . of all God's victims, -of those who in His cause have gone out like Christ as sheep in the midst of wolves." Other writers, however, give more attention to the function of dogma as a basis for further progress in the dis- covery of truth. M. Denis, controller of the publication Annales de philosophie chretienne, is quoted by Lilley (Modern- ism, p. 28) as lamenting that this view has not been taken in France: "Dogma is a light to lead us on; we have made it a barrier beyond which we dare not go. ..... We have no relations with anything that is vital, neither with science nor with society nor with the state." The Modernist attitude to dogma is entirely consistent with the democrati- zation of the church. Tyrrell accepts the accusation that Modernists regard authority as resting on "the agreement of individual minds" and contrasts this with the present papal dictatorship. Loisy's Pvangile was condemned on the ground that "it is calculated seriously to disturb the belief of the faithful in the fundamental dogmas of Catholic teach- ing." The list of teachings imperiled concludes with "the divine institution of</page><page sequence="8">514 THE BIBLICAL WORLD the Episcopate and of the Sovereign Pontificate." The triumph of Modern- ism would assuredly spell the doom of the " Sovereign Pontificate," for it would give authority to "the agreement of individual minds." It is doubtful if the methods taken for the suppression of Modernism have succeeded even in seriously hampering its propaganda. Recent events are cal- culated to revive radical tendencies in the church and to bring about a state of mind in which Modernist views will be considered more favorably than was to be expected ten years ago. The Encyclical Pascendi deplores the influ- ence of the movement upon the young; to which Tyrrell replies: "If the young are with us we have only to wait. A generation more and the whole world will be with us" (Mediaevalism, p. I20).</page></plain_text>
