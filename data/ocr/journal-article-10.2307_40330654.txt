<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time in a Sepik River Village Simon Harrison* Introduction Many anthropologists who have worked among yam-growing peoples in the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea have noted a close symbolic identification made between yams and human beings. Typically, yams are thought to be animated, mobile and to have supernatural powers; in ceremonial contexts they are dressed and decorated anthropomorphically; and success in yam-growing is a source of prestige for men, and close mystical ties are thought to exist between yams and their cultivators (Forge 1966; Kaberry 1941-42, 1971; Whiting and Reed 1938-39). Tuzin (1972) in particular has discussed this anthropomorphic symbolism of yams in detail for the Ilahita Arapesh, drawing on psychoanalytic and neurophysiological evidence. In this paper, I discuss a version of this complex as it exists at Avatip,1 a community on the Sepik River in the Ambunti District of the East Sepik Province. Perhaps the single most important way in which the equation of yams and human beings is expressed at Avatip is that the yam-production schedule and the age-grade system are linked together in a single body of ritual practice and belief, through which they are not only symbolically identified with each other but also synchronized. Draw- ing on the ideas of Douglas (1966), Leach (1961, 1964) and Tambiah (1968), I try to show that the ritual identification of yam cultivation with the age-grade system is the basis of a scheme for what Leach calls the symbolic representation of time. Avatip is one of three river communities speaking a Ndu-family language, which Laycock (1965) has called Manambu. Like other Sepik River groups, such as the Iatmiil immediately downriver from them (Bateson 1932, 1936), the Manambu are fishermen, sago-gatherers and horticulturalists. Wage-labour and the sale of cash-crops nowadays supple- ment their traditional mode of subsistence. Culturally and linguistically, they are closely related to the Iatmül: perhaps the main difference between them and the Iatmiil is the greater importance of yam cultivation in the Manambu economy, permitted by the somewhat higher lie of their land, and an elaborate yam cult associated with this. These are features which ally them more to the hill- and plains-dwelling Ndu-speaking societies to their north than to the river-dwelling Iatmiil. With a population of nearly thirteen hundred people, Avatip is by far the largest of the three Manambu communities.2 This seems to be a result mainly of its highly favoured position opposite the confluence of the * Department of Prehistory and Anthropology, The Australian National University. 1 Fieldwork at Avatip was conducted during 1977-79, under a postgraduate scholarship in the Department of Prehistory and Anthropology, Australian National University. 2 Avatip is comprised of two villages: Yentshanggai, which has the bulk of the population and is located on the Sepik, and the smaller village of Yawmbak situated some 5 km inland on a lagoon. Until the 1920s, these were a single village, and they still continue to form a unitary intermarrying and ceremonial community. Unless otherwise stated, the material presented in this paper refers specifically to the village of Yentshanggai. 141</page><page sequence="2">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time Amoku and Sepik Rivers. The Amoku is the largest tributary of the Sepik in the area. The Manambu environment consists primarily of swamps, lakes, and rivers, although a wedge of forested and relatively well drained land follows the Amoku down to the Sepik, and provides the vilage with extensive sago-stands, hunting-grounds, and many kinds of forest resources. It also enables the people to cultivate yams more inten- sively than the other two Manambu villages as I shall describe below. Avatip, like the two other Manambu villages, is very largely endoga- mous and, before European contact, was an independent war-making unit. The community is composed of three exogamous totemic patrilineal descent groups, two of which, Nggala'angkw and Wuluwi-Nyawi, account each for a little under half of the Avatip population, so that in demo- graphic terms there is very nearly a moiety system. Yet the units which effectively arrange marriage and act in a political capacity in village affairs are sub-clans, of which there are sixteen. These are also the residential units, each in theory being associated with its own ward, in which its male members reside together with their wives and its unmarried females. The community is politically uncentralized and, while lethal fighting has always been prohibited within it, each sub-clan claims a considerable degree of autonomy. One of the most important mechanisms by which the village is integrated and, so to speak, bound together into an organic whole is a division of ritual and magical responsibilities between its descent groups. The three primary groups and each of the sub-clans within them are vested with distinctive hereditary ritual functions, and specialized forms of magic and sorcery for the control of the fertility of particular natural species and areas of land, and for manipulating weather and various other phenomena. Each also possesses a set of origin myths and ancestral personal names which give title to these prerogatives. The majority of these specializations are distributed between Wuluwi-Nyawi and NggOla'angkw, and in a consistently complementary manner. In this way the relationship between these two groups indeed resembles a 'classical' moiety system, the ritual and cosmological attributes of each tending to be the counterparts of those of the other. Ngg9!a'angkw, for example, controls the fertility of the village's main fishing-lagoons, and of fish in general, while Wuluwi- Nyawi, as I shall describe below, controls the fertility of yams and the timing of the yam cultivation schedule. As the people see it, no one of the village's segments could exist as an entirely autonomous entity, because it is organically inter-dependent with the others in the maintenance of the ritual system and the natural order. Sub-clans of the same exogamous group are ranked by seniority, so that in principle the most important totemic, ritual and magical specializa- tions fall to the most senior. Relations between sub-clans are highly com- petitive: particularly between collateral sub-clans, despite their differential seniority. Sub-clans regularly attempt to plagiarise and appropriate from each other prestigious names, myths, and other privileges. These disputes are resolved in formal public debates, called saki, which are the central political forum of the society. Within each sub-clan one man or some- times several men are acknowledged as its leaders. The position is based on their skill in debating, knowledge of esoteric mythology, ritual seniority, and expertise in magic and sorcery. These are exclusively male proficien- cies and ideally they go with age and genealogical status. Throughout the yam-growing areas of the Sepik, two main yam species are grown: Dioscorea alata and D. esculenta. Usually, alata has a special 142</page><page sequence="3">Simon Harrison ceremonial importance. Among the Abelam (Lea 1964) and Ilahita Arapesh (Tuzin 1972), for example, special methods are used for the cultivation of alata by means of which enormous tubers are produced: the so-called long yams. They are cultivated exclusively by men in sacred gardens prohibited to women, who are thought to be inimical to their growth. They have great ritual significance and prestige value, and are used in competitive ceremonial exchange. At Avatip as well, the distinction between alata and esculenta is an important one: the two species are cultivated in separate gardens and, as among the Abelam and Ilahita Arapesh, alata has a special ritual significance. But there are also a number of differences from the Abelam and Ilahita patterns. Yams are a totem of Wuluwi-Nyawi, which, as I have said, is one of the three primary intermarrying groups at Avatip, and the magic and ritual connected with yam-growing are a special hereditary proficiency of this group. Wuluwi-Nyawi has a number of particularly important functions in relation to the alata gardens: it has ritual control of the alata garden schedule and directs the cultivation of these gardens. Before the gardens can be cleared and planted, certain hereditary ritual specialists acting on its behalf must give their authorization in a yam- fertility rite. And before they can be harvested, a first-fruits ritual must be performed, the timing of which is again decided by these specialists. This is an exclusively male ritual and is part of a system of three initiatory grades. It is performed by men of the second grade, and every four or five years they hold an especially elaborate version of the harvest ritual which inducts a new batch of novices into their grade. From the time an alata garden is planted until the harvest ritual is performed, the garden is under an interdiction: nothing in it can be har- vested and its owners are forbidden even to disturb its surface un- necessarily. The first fruits ritual lifts this interdiction. The focal point of the ritual is a presentation by the men of Wuluwi-Nyawi of the gardens' first-fruits to their sisters' children, an act regarded as the annual recapitu- lation of the myth of the origin of yams, according to which the totemic ancestors of Wuluwi-Nyawi were responsible for the dissemination of yams into the world. The cultivation of the esculenta gardens, on the other hand, is not under any centralized control of this kind. They are harvested without any important ritual. The villagers plant them early in the wet season, but each household is free to choose the precise point at which it does so. Planting magic is performed individually for each garden, rather than collectively for the whole village as with the alata gardens. Once planted, the gardens are under no lengthy interdiction, and their owners may begin harvesting them whenever they judge them ready. Despite its ritual significance, yam-growing at Avatip is second in economic importance to fishing and sago-exploitation, largely as a conse- quence of the nature of the environment, and no regular surpluses of yams are produced. All the yams grown, except for those reserved for replanting, are fairly quickly consumed. It is probably for this reason that there is no competitive ceremonial exchange of yams or any other garden produce, as this would require a more intensive system of cultivation than is probably possible. Because of the annual rise and fall of the river, the growing season is relatively brief and no long yams are grown. There is little difference in length between alata and esculenta tubers, and no particular prestige is 143</page><page sequence="4">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time attached to the size of yams. Successful production of yams is important for fulfilling obligations towards affines and uterine kin, but these trans- actions take place essentially under the form of what Sahlins (1972) calls generalized reciprocity. Neither these exchanges nor yam-production involve any kind of formal competition or provide avenues to leadership. Competitive yam-gardening would in any case be precluded by the fact that all garden magic, which throughout the Sepik is thought essential to the yams' growth,3 is vested exclusively in a single descent group. Yams are particularly important as gifts from men to their sisters' children, and all gifts of this kind are described as 'giving mother's milk' (amei mun kwina). Unlike the long yams of the Abelam and Ilahita Arapesh, the symbolic valency of yams at Avatip is at least as maternal and nurturing as it is phallic and aggressive. As among the Abelam and Ilahita, the ritual and magic associated with yam-growing are entirely in male hands. Otherwise, the belief that women are inimical to the growth of yams exists only in a relatively attenuated form. There are none of the elaborate sex taboos connected with alata cultivation that Forge (1966:28), for example, has described for the Abelam. Women play as important a part in the growing of alata as men; the cultivation of both the alata and esculenta gardens involves a division of labour between the adult males, women, and children of each house- hold. Women are excluded from all yam gardens when menstruating: not, significantly, on the grounds that this would be directly harmful to the yams but that it would attract wild pigs to the gardens. The differences between the Avatip pattern and that of the Abelam and Ilahita Arapesh might be summed up as follows. Among the latter the cultivation of alata is an important focus of competition for prestige between men. Women are ritually prohibited from the alata gardens, so that the exclusively male cultivation of alata is at the same time an expres- sion of the difference in ritual and social status between the sexes. At Avatip, however, the emphasis is slightly shifted. First, the opposition between male and female, as it is expressed in the organization of yam production and in the ritual connected with it, still exists but in a weaker form. Second, the idea of male competition in alata production is entirely absent. As I shall explain later, alata is spoken of as the elder brother of esculenta, and the distinction between the two species is connected sym- bolically with the concept of relative seniority among men. A major referent of Avatip yam symbolism is a type of relationship between men which in theory precludes competition. In fact, there is a good deal of submerged rivalry between seniors and juniors but, as I shall explain later, this is expressed in yam symbolism in the form of a mystical anti- pathy which is thought to exist between alata and esculenta, the elder and younger brother yams. Such aggressive and phallic significance as yams have at Avatip does not relate to their being instruments of competition between men but to the fact that the ritual relationship between alata and esculenta is a symbolic reference to the more or less latent antagonism between seniors and juniors. These shifts in Avatip yam symbolism away from the Abelam and Arapesh patterns fit with a general emphasis of Avatip culture and social organization. Avatip is in a number of ways a sexually segregated society, like many in Melanesia. But my impression is that the male and female principles are thought of as less antagonistic, and women as less polluting 3 See for example Forge 1962. 144</page><page sequence="5">Simon Harrison to men, than elsewhere in the immediate area. Avatip is also a somewhat less egalitarian society than some of its neighbours appear to be. There is a strong element of ascription in leadership: it is based on the control not of wealth but of esoteric knowledge - secret mythology, magic, and ritual esoterica - and, as I have said, this expertise goes with age, and ritual and genealogical seniority. In general, relations between adult men are viewed as asymmetrical or hierarchical, and in theory there is not the same freedom of competition between males that one usually associates with egalitarian New Guinea societies. The same principle manifests itself in relations between groups, in the form of the ranking of collateral descent groups by genealogical and mythological seniority which I mentioned earlier, a feature of social structure again apparently atypical of the immediate ethnographic area. In short, there is a pervasive concern at Avatip with differential seniority in age, genealogy, and ritual status. These are social relation- ships in which time is an essential dimension, since they involve ordering persons and groups on the basis of some form of chronological priority. In accord with its importance in social classification, time, and its expres- sion in social relations in the form of differential seniority, are a recurrent theme of Avatip symbolism, as I shall try to illustrate in this paper. Yam Cultivation Each year, an Avatip household plants two yam gardens and harvests two yam crops, on a staggered schedule of cultivation. The first garden to be planted is made on the levee of the Sepik River, within a mile or two of the village and among the stands of wild sugarcane which grow on the river-bank. The second is made on the Amoku River in secondary forest. Both types of garden last for two years at most and must then be left for a long period of fallow, during which new sites are cleared and fired. Although yams are the main crop, banana, sugarcane, corn, cassava and leafy greens are also grown. Both gardens have approximately the same area and yield. The most important difference between the two types of garden, from the villagers' point of view, is in the species of yam cultivated in them. The river gardens are primarily devoted to the growing of D. alata (nya'an) and the bush gardens to the cultivation of D. esculenta (kamnggaw). Bush gardens are known as Kambdr9 mai (Amoku River gardens) or kamnggaw mai (esculenta gardens) and the river gardens are called soa mwi mai (wild sugarcane-place gardens) in reference to their location. In fact, a number of esculenta are always planted in the river gardens, just as small quantities of alata are always planted in the bush gardens, as a precaution against the loss of one or other of the two species through flood. The Amoku River has been known to burst its banks, destroying the bush gardens, while Sepik floods similarly sometimes ruin the river gardens. But in principle, the river gardens are associated with alata and the bush gardens with esculenta. The distinction between the two species of yam, and the corresponding distinction between the two types of garden, have very great ritual and symbolic importance as I shall describe below. Alata and esculenta differ from each other in physical appearance and in their manner of propagation. For example, the alata plant produces a single tuber, roughly cylindrical in shape, and is propagated from a tuber cutting. With esculenta, on the other hand, an entire tuber is planted: it produces a large number of tubers each a little smaller than alata and 145</page><page sequence="6">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time more spindle-shaped. Alata varieties generally have smooth skins, while the skins of esculenta varieties are covered with hair-like rootlets. The direction of twining of the vines is dextrose or right-handed in alata, and sinistrose or left-handed in esculenta (see Coursey 1967). The location of Avatip at the mouth of the Amoku is an unusually favoured one for a river village as I mentioned earlier, because this gives it access to land which is relatively high and suitable for cultivation. It is this land which makes it possible to cultivate two yam gardens each year. The other two Manambu villages do not have access to terrain of this kind and their territories, like those of most other riverain villages, con- sist almost entirely of seasonally inundated swamps. For this reason, they are able to cultivate only river gardens, in which alata and esculenta are grown together, and so produce only one yam crop each year, consisting of both species. The double schedule of cultivation practised at Avatip, and the set of conceptual oppositions which, as I shall explain, are based on it, are connected directly with Avatip's somewhat atypical geographical situation. The year has very distinct wet and dry seasons, each of about equal length: the dry season (nyakamali) lasts roughly from April until October, and the wet season (kwaiyungkw) from September to March. The differ- ences in environmental conditions between the two seasons are very pro- nounced. In the dry season, for example, the river is low and the water turbid and warm with seepage from the stagnant back-swamps and lagoons. Once the rains begin, the river rises and the water turns cold and relatively clear; the direction of flow in its smaller tributaries reverses itself as the river feeds water back into the swamps. The river rises an average of some twenty feet above its dry season level, flooding large areas of the surrounding land and in some years the village as well. The dry season is associated with the daily appearance of dense heat-haze, and a relative absence of mosquitoes. In the wet, the air is clear and the mosquitoes are at their worst. I should mention that these and many other contrasts between the two seasons play an important part in Avatip totemism, magic, and cosmology. I have mentioned a number of oppositions more or less given in the Avatip environment: alata and esculenta, the wet and dry seasons, the river and the Amoku bushlands. These contrasted pairs, as I shall show later, carry a strong symbolic loading and play an important part in the ordering of time. Fishing and sago-exploitation are relatively unaffected by the seasons. Yam-gardening, however, is finely adjusted to the seasonal cycle, and for this reason is highly vulnerable to unseasonal conditions. Yams require dry conditions, and yam cultivation in an environment with as perennially as high a water-table as the Sepik River floodplain is a risky undertaking. Floods, or simply a rise in the water-level at the wrong time of year, can damage or completely ruin a yam-crop. Both the river gardens and the bush gardens are cleared and fired in the dry season, the only period of the year suited to burning off: the river gardens at the beginning of the dry and the bush gardens towards its end. Both types are ready to harvest -about eight months later. The river gardens, the lower of the two in elevation, in this way mature over the driest part of the year and are harvested early in the wet, usually in December. They are fired first so as to be ready to be harvested before the river reaches its height, and for this reason they must be fired as soon as conditions permit. If a late start 146</page><page sequence="7">Simon Harrison to the dry season postpones firing, or if the river rises early while the gardens are still immature, the crop may be ruined. The bush gardens, for their part, mature over the wet season - a procedure made possible by their higher elevation - and are harvested around the beginning of the following dry. But although on higher land, they are always at risk from the high water-table present during their maturation period (see Fig. 1).

Time is also an important aspect of yam-gardening in the sense that, unlike fishing and sago-production, the cultivation schedule involves a long sequence of interconnected activities taking a year to complete. Not surprisingly, there- fore, it is yam-growing, the magical and ritual acts associated with it, and the changes in the environment significant for it, that provide almost all the reference-points in the yearly calendar. To use Evans-Pritchard's phrase, people tend to think of time as a relation between activities (Evans-Pritchard 1940:103); and at Avatip these activities are essentially those connected with yam horticulture. This can be illustrated as follows. The longest period of time for which there is a term in the Manambu language is a gardening season, or nambi. There are, as I have said, two of these each year. They are reckoned as lasting from the beginning of clearing until the beginning of the harvest, so that each lasts for about eight months and they overlap with each other for some four months. Now, if one interpreted a nambi as an abstract unit of time, it would of course be meaningless to speak of a year as made up of two such periods, each eight months long and overlapping by four months. While people do often use the term as though it were a unit of time - speaking, for example, of 'next nambi9, or of something having happened 'during the last nambi9 - a nambi is in fact thought of primarily as a sequence of tasks rather than as an abstract measure of time. A nambi refers to all the activities between and including the clearing of a garden site and its eventual harvest, rather than to the period of time which these occupy. Time-reckoning, as Evans-Pritchard showed for the Nuer, is embedded in activities and does not form an autonomous system separate from them and to which they could be referred. Although there is no term for a year in the Manambu language, this unit of time is very clearly recognized since it takes exactly a year for the completion of the total gardening cycle, the sequence of rituals associated with it, and the environmental changes to which it is adapted. To show how the horticultural cycle orders the calendar, I shall briefly describe the cultivation schedule of the river and bush gardens. The two schedules are by no means identical: each involves a different organization of labour, and a distinct set of magical beliefs and practices. It is primarily on the 147</page><page sequence="8">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time rites connected with gardening that I should like to focus, for it is mainly in these, performed at important transitional stages in the cultivation cycle, that the temporal organization of the year is symbolized. As will be seen, the common theme of all the ritual and magic associated with yam-growing is the identification of yams with their cultivators. The changes which the gardens and their crop undergo in the course of the horticultural cycle are ones which the community as well ritually under- goes. The calendar, then, is structured by a sequence of ritual acts in which the village symbolically identifies with the stages of growth of the yams. Late in the wet season, the wild sugar-cane along the Sepik River produces a tall white inflorescence, which is called kwun, and which withers and falls during the transition to the dry. The withering of the kwun marks the beginning of the new year and of the time for cutting the new river gardens: it signifies the start of the agricultural schedule and is the most important natural event in the Avatip calendar.4 It is during the withering of the kwun that the ceremony is performed which ritually inaugurates the start of the year's yam gardening. Once this ritual has been completed, a simple but important magical rite must be performed before the clearing and firing of the river gardens can begin. The purpose of this rite, which is called su sakwunand ('he cuts down the wild sugar-cane'), is to ensure a plentiful yam crop, as is that of the ritual which preceded it. 5m sakwunand is a special prerogative of two Wuluwi-Nyawi lineages; a magical specialist of one of these lineages goes to one of the previous year's river gardens and cuts down a few stalks of wild sugarcane as a symbolic inauguration of the clearing, and then plants a row of bespelled alata cuttings. Once their vines have begun to grow, he announces this to the community and the clearing of the new river gardens may then begin. After a river garden has been cleared and fenced, it is planted in stages over a period of weeks, only a small area being planted at a time. The reason for this procedure is that a certain number of the cuttings usually fail to grow, so that some areas of the garden have to be replanted. If a garden was planted all at once, it would be impossible to do this since once a river garden has been completely planted it cannot again be disturbed until the harvest ritual has been performed. While the yam crop is growing, weeding must be done very carefully, so as not to disturb the ground. Nothing in the garden may be harvested until the first fruits ritual, and any breach of the interdiction would pro- voke an automatic mystical attack by the spirits thought to inhabit the tubers. Sometimes a garden matures in advance of the harvest ritual and its owners must simply allow its produce to rot. Harvesting the river gardens ends an annual period of yam shortage, the previous harvest - that of the bush gardens - having taken place about eight months earlier. For this reason the harvest ritual is eagerly awaited: the single most important prerogative which Wuluwi-Nyawi holds is its control of the timing of this ritual. This is the period of the year that people want to pass most quickly; and it is characteristic of corporate power-relations at Avatip that the right to control the length of this period should be held by a specific descent group. As the river 4 For an account of the symbolism and beliefs associated with this period of the year, see Harrison 1978. 148</page><page sequence="9">Simon Harrison gardens mature, people keep a close watch on the rising level of the river: ideally, the gardens should be harvested just before the water-level begins to reach them. The villagers' concern with the growing crop involves more than just the desire to eat yams again after a long period of scarcity. A successful crop is seen as a sign that Wuluwi-Nyawi has properly dis- charged its main magical and ritual responsibility to the community, and the lifting of the interdiction is regarded as a kind of prestation by this group. The harvest is thus in an important sense an annual reaffirmation of the bonds between the segments of society. While the villagers wait for the river gardens to mature, two games are played at different stages in the maturation of the yams. Cat's-cradle (mbimandj) - a game for both sexes and all age-groups - comes into season when the vines begin to climb their poles; and spinning-tops, or wa'am, a competitive game for two teams, is played at the end of the growth period of the vines. Although the villagers themselves do not point spontaneously to such an interpretation, it is difficult not to see the game of cat's-cradle as involving a kind of kinaesthetic identification with the growing yams, the meshing of the string suggesting the tangling together of the yam-vines as they accumulate on the poles. The game of spinning- tops also, I suggest, involves an identification with the yams, although it is a little less obvious. There are a number of different named forms of the game, some for children, some for adult women, and some for men. Those for adult males are considered the most difficult and demanding; and when men in particular play spinning-tops it is seen as an expression of their ka'aw - or competitiveness and fighting spirit. All the terms for the different sorts of spinning-top games, and in fact for competitive games of all kinds, end in the morpheme -ka'aw, which in this way signifies what Huizinga (1949) would call their agonistic nature. Ka'aw is an attribute not only highly admired in men but is also, as I shall explain later, the quality most desired in yams. While the yams are near maturing, and reaching their maximum degree of ka'aw, the men identify with them by displaying their own fighting-spirit in the game of spinning-tops. Neither of the two games is thought to have any magical effect on the yams' growth. Their effect, I suggest, is rather one which Douglas argues is common to all forms of ritual behaviour, secular or religious: that of creating what she calls a frame or focus (Douglas 1966:63). Played during the period of collective expectation concerning the coming harvest, the games bring it into sharpened definition and give it concrete form. The date for the harvest ceremony5 is decided a few days beforehand by the ritual leaders of Wuluwi-Nyawi, who pass the word secretly to all the initiated men. Great care is taken to keep the preparations hidden from the women and children, as the ritual is intended to take them by surprise. It is in effect a triple rite de passage: for the yams, a rite of passage from a tabood state in the gardens to an edible one in the village; for the village, from scarcity to abundance; and, in the case of the initiatory version of the ritual, a rite of passage from the first to the second ritual grade for a set of novices. This then, briefly described, is the river garden cultivation schedule. The cultivation of the bush gardens involves a rather different pattern of activities. There is no ritual to inaugurate clearing, and each household begins at its own convenience, generally some four months after the river 5 For reasons of space, it is impossible to describe this ritual here and it is hoped to give a detailed account of it elsewhere. 14!;</page><page sequence="10">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time gardens have been cleared. In contrast to a river garden, planting a bush garden is a collective activity carried out in a single morning by a large group of some thirty or forty men, women, and children: each household has a reciprocal arrangement with a number of others for this purpose. The planting of a bush garden is, among other things, an important social event, and most of the magical beliefs and practices connected with the bush gardens are focussed upon this day. The yam-planting magic for the river gardens, as I explained, is per- formed for the whole community at the start of the cultivation schedule. With the bush gardens, however, yam magic is performed individually for each garden as it is planted. The techniques employed are specific to the bush gardens, although they also are the corporate property of Wuluwi- Nyawi. At Avatip there are some twenty specialists in this magic: each household must obtain the services of one of these men on the day of planting its bush garden. Digging the holes for the yams is men's work. All yam gardens are divided into individually owned strips, and the men move in a group up one strip and down the next, covering the garden in zig-zag fashion. The magician sprinkles a bespelled infusion of aromatic leaves over the seed yams, and then follows behind the men placing the yams in the holes, accompanied by children who supply him with the tubers. Behind the magician, the women follow, covering the yams with soil. During the planting, the workers must observe a number of special prohibitions. They must not fold their arms or clasp their hands, as it is said that this would cause the yams to grow misshapen. It is also thought that the magically potent state of the bespelled seed yams presents a mild hazard to any unweaned children who have been brought to the planting: the proximity of the yams can cause infants to have attacks of feverish sweating, and their mothers must take special precautions to protect them from this. They must not breast-feed them in the garden, and when covering over the yams they should first place a short stick against each tuber and then withdraw it after filling in the hole so as to leave an air-passage. This is said to cool the magical heat of the yams and prevent it from being transferred to the children. After the garden has been planted, everyone leaves it except for the magician, who performs a final magical act: he walks around the garden blowing a fine spray of water over it, a rite which is meant to call the yams to life and which places the garden out of bounds until the following day. For it is expected that during the afternoon, after everyone has left, the garden will be visited by the yams from the gardens already planted, who will thrash the newly-planted tubers to make them warlike and aggressive. Many people claim to have heard, while passing a bush garden on the night after its planting, a confused mêlée of shouts and thuds as the yams belaboured each other. It is, they say, a private affair of the yams and anyone who intruded on it would be mobbed and beaten by the infuriated tubers. It is the yams' equivalent of an initiatory ordeal: humans are excluded from it in the same way as the uninitiated are from analogous ordeals in male ritual. The prohibition on entering a newly planted bush garden corresponds to the interdiction laid on a river garden but, instead of lasting for the whole of the garden's maturation period, it is, as it were, compressed into a single day. Once the magician has put the final spell on the garden, the owners give the working-party a meal of yam soup (ndjanggwi). This food is 150</page><page sequence="11">Simon Harrison meant to make the workers sweat - in adults a sign of good health and vigour - and, sympathetically, to cause the yams to sweat as well. But the person most strongly identified with yams is the garden magician. His food, which includes a number of special delicacies, is served in his ma'ar, the bowl in which he mixes the magical infusion for the seed yams; and once he has planted a garden, he must follow a number of food taboos until all the gardens he has planted are mature. These are taboos princi- pally against the eating of watery or soft foods which, it is said, would cause the yam crop to soften and rot. As the vines begin to grow, people stop baking mollusc shells for lime for a few weeks. Young esculenta vines are said to be more delicate than those of alata, and the acrid smell of burning lime would cause them to wither and die. The harvest of bush gardens is not awaited with the same expectancy as that of river gardens. It takes place only some four months after the latter and ends no period of scarcity, or at least only a brief one. This second harvest is a less important event than the first. It is probably due largely to this that the bush garden harvest, and their cultivation cycle as a whole, has a lesser ritual significance. People begin to harvest their bush gardens as soon as they judge them ready: in connexion with this, each household individually performs a small informal ceremony. The aroma- tic leaves used in the planting magic are buried with some of the seed yams when the garden is planted, and these are marked with stakes. The tubers which these produce are taken as the garden's first-fruits, and are brought back to the village and used by the owners for a small public feast for the people who helped them plant the garden.6 Yam gardening, as I said earlier, is a sequence of activities occupying the whole year, and there are few periods when there is no work of one kind or another to be done. It provides a maximum of co-ordinates in the calendar and gives the year a definite processual form. The stages of the cultivation cycle described are marked by distinctive games, magical acts, and collective rituals. Whatever the different ostensible purposes of these, they all have one property in common: they all establish meta- phorical or métonymie (Tambiah 1968) relations of various kinds between the yams and their cultivators. Performed at crucial points in the cultiva- tion cycle, they emulate or in some other way express an identification with the changes which the yam crop goes through. They vary in ritual importance and presumed magical efficacy; but they can all be viewed as major or minor rites de passage which the community and its yam crop undergo in tandem, and which in this way compartmentalise the year into a coherent series of periods. Yams have a very great symbolic value, and it is not surprising that the collective experience of time is ritually geared to the stages of their growth. The villagers' apprehension of the annual cycle is closely linked with yam gardening simply in the sequence of physical tasks which it involves; but the effect of the magic and ritual associated with the gardening schedule is to institutionalize this link. They define the points in the calendar significant for the growth of yams as being those significant for society. The Taboo Against Admixture of River and Bush Garden Yams A very important taboo is connected with the dichotomy between alata and esculenta: river garden and bush garden yams must in their raw state 6 Interestingly, these first-fruits of the bush gardens are called wapi, the Abelam term for a long yam (see Kaberry 1971:40). 151</page><page sequence="12">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time be physically kept completely separate, and it is held that any contact between them while still raw would afflict the household with sickness and death. The two types of tuber may not be stored together: river garden yams are kept in yam-houses (mbeiwi) in the village, while there are separate yam-houses for the bush garden tubers in the bush gardens them- selves. The two kinds of yam cannot be cooked together in the same pot, and one type cannot be cooked in water that has been used for cooking the other. People speak of this taboo as a prohibition of contact between alata and esculenta. But, as I explained earlier, each type of garden in fact always contains a small number of plants of the species distinctive to the other. Conceptually, the taboo refers to the species of yam, but in actuality it refers to the type of garden in which they have been grown. As I have mentioned, the river gardens have a far greater ritual import- ance than the bush gardens. Part of the significance of the taboo against contact between river garden and bush garden tubers is that it is a way of expressing this difference between them in ritual value. There are, however, a number of further and equally important con- ceptual dichotomies expressed in this taboo. The distinction between the Sepik River (nya'amb) and dry land or bush (namb) - which at Avatip means the Amoku River bushlands - is perhaps the most basic spatial dichotomy which Avatip people make. Their culture is a riverine adapta- tion: they view the lakes and waterways as their distinctive habitat and treat land almost as a hostile element, a barrier to movement and com- munication. More at home on water than on dry land, they easily become disoriented in the bush and lose themselves. They always prefer, if at all possible, to travel by canoe and go to great lengths to avoid travel on foot: 'Canoes', they say, 'are our mothers; they carry us everywhere'. While Avatip people consider themselves essentially fishermen, the Amoku River bush is settled by people of a different adaptation: land- rather than water-%ased, horticulturalists and sago-palm exploiters. These bushdwellers have much the same attitudes to water as Avatip has to dry land; without canoes or any water-skills until very recent times, they are expert woodsmen with a strong aversion to open water. Along much of the Sepik, an almost symbiotic relationship exists between the river peoples and their inland neighbours. Each of the two groups has a relatively specialized economy and regularly trades to the other its main produce: fish and sago-starch respectively. This symbiosis exists despite the fact that in pre-contact times the bush-dwellers were typically the main target for the head-hunting raids of the river villages (see for example Gewertz 1978:39-40). The relationship between Avatip and the Amoku River bush people - with some qualifications I shall mention below - essentially follows this same pattern. Avatip people refer to the bush-dwellers as numbundu, or 'dry land men', a strongly derogatory appellation, rather like 'landlubber'. Avatip fought them before pacification and they are feared and ridiculed. The stereotype numbundu is without the basic skills - canoing, swimming and so on - which even a child at Avatip possesses. Such a person is un- kempt and dirty, supposedly because of a lack of water, and lives 'like a dog or pig' (mbal as k9!dk) in a small, inferior house built directly on the ground, rather than in a large dwelling on piles as in the river villages. Last and most important, he is an avid practitioner of a form of exuvial sorcery, which is foreign to the Manambu villages and highly feared by them. 152</page><page sequence="13">Simon Harrison Even nowadays, the Amoku River bush continues to be viewed as foreign and potentially dangerous territory. Whenever they are there, working in bush gardens or at other tasks, people dispose of their leavings very carefully, in case they should be taken by the Numbundu and used in sorcery against them. In contrast, the Sepik River is very much 'home territory': after a day's work, as people drift home down the Amoku in their canoes, there is a perceptible feeling of relief as they enter the main river. The Sepik represents both a symbolic and physical barrier between Avatip and the sorcery-ridden Numbundu: as the villagers say, 'Do our leavings have legs, that they could cross that water?' In the village and on the river, people can safely be careless with their exuviae. Water is in fact the one element thought to have the power to neutralize sorcery: leavings dropped in water lose their potency and cannot be used for sorcery. The distinction between river and bush, nya'amb and namb, is then at the same time the difference between home and hostile territory, between Avatip and the Numbundu, and between two distinctive modes of adapta- tion, one riverine and superior and the other land-based and inferior. The fact that this geographical and cultural distinction manifests itself in fears of sorcery, shows I think how absolute and pervasive it is. Esculenta is often spoken of idiomatically as numbundu, the 'dry land man'; and alata is referred to as nya'ambanggwu, the 'river water (tuber)', or sometimes as kwalinggwu, the '(tuber of the) Phragmites reed water' - a reference to a species of reed which grows along the bank of the Sepik. All the negative and sinister connotations of dry land and the Numbundu, and the positive associations of the river and the village, are encapsulated for the villagers in the contrast between the two species. This is also expressed in the location of the yam-houses for the bush and river tubers: the former, as I mentioned earlier, are situated in the bush gardens and the latter not in the gardens but in the village itself. These then are a further set of opposed valencies which river and bush tubers have, in addition to their different ritual value. I should mention that Avatip acquired the Amoku River territory by warfare in the nineteenth century. It made war continually against the Numbundu, who originally were apparently quite a large population scattered in small, autonomous palisaded hamlets, in order to gain this highly valuable land. By the time that European administration was first imposed in the 1920s, Avatip had almost entirely displaced them, so that now only a few small group« remain. An important point, and one to which I shall return at the end of this paper, is that it is likely that cultivation on the Amoku began only once the village's expansion into that area was underway and the Numbundu occupying it were being driven northwards away from the Sepik. Before then, it is probable that Avatip people made only river gardens, cultivating in them both alata and esculenta like the two other villages of the Manambu. Although Avatip people pride themselves on being river-dwellers and fishermen, in fact their economy is a good deal more like that of the Numbundu than they would probably like to suppose. The Amoku River bush has not only enabled the village to intensify yam-production beyond the level normal for a river village but has also made it largely self- sufficient in sago and many other forest resources. Trade for sago with the Numbundu is not nearly as essential as it is for many other river villages. Its acquisition of the Amoku River bushlands has made its economy relatively diversified in comparison with those of most other 153</page><page sequence="14">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time river-peoples, who are fairly specialized fishermen. In displacing the Numbundu, Avatip in effect acquired something of that people's mode of subsistence, adding it to their own, previously entirely riverine, adaptation. Avatip then is in something of a paradoxical situation: with a strong sense of the distinctiveness and superiority of its riverine life-style, its mode of livelihood is in reality rather more like a hybrid between that of the Numbundu and that of a typical river village. Here, the symbolic opposition between alata and esculenta, the river- yams and the dry-land-yams, plays an important conceptual role. It main- tains intact the ideological distinction between river and bush, Avatip and the Numbundu, internalizing it within Avatip culture itself. This distinc- tion, which forms so important a part of the society's conception of its identity, is one which it itself in fact contravenes to some extent. But it preserves the dichotomy by incorporating it within its own scheme of ritual ideas and practice. There is a further role which, as I shall try to show, is played by the ritual antithesis of alata and esculenta, and which is closely connected with the foregoing: this is in the symbolic representation of time. As one can see from Figure 1, the river gardens provide food for the wet season and the bush gardens dry season food. Alata are considered essentially food for the wet and esculenta food for the dry. I mentioned earlier that people speak of esculenta as 'dry land' tubers and of alata as 'river water' tubers. There is then a wet/dry contrast between the two species in both a spatial sense (the opposition between river and bush) and a temporal one (the opposition between the wet and dry seasons). As I explained earlier, the contrast in environmental conditions between the wet and dry seasons is very pronounced, as is the contrast in the pattern of economic and other activities between the two gardening cycles which make up the year. Each of the two 'halves' of the year has its own strongly marked character; and the taboo against admixture of river and bush tubers is a way of expressing the dichotomy between these two dis- tinctive periods of time. The critical points are the transitions from one to the other; for it is primarily during these that people may for a while be eating both types of yam simultaneously and that contact between them is likely to occur. It is essentially to these interstitial periods that the prohibition against admixture really refers. During these intervals - neither one season nor the other - the seasonal dichotomy is symbolically preserved in the form of the strict physical separation of wet and dry season food. The overt reason for the taboo which the villagers themselves always give is that the two types of tuber are elder and younger brother to each other, and that they would fight if they were stored or cooked together.7 It is this fighting that would bring sickness and death to the household. Alata is the elder brother and esculenta the younger brother. In practice, this idiom is used to describe the relation between river garden and bush garden tubers in general. In real life there is in principle a considerable difference in status between elder and younger brother. The senior has a quasi-paternal authority over his junior and expects deference and respect 7 The terms for these kin types (ma'am and nyamus respectively) in fact denote elder and younger siblings of the same sex; yams however are treated as male, and for convenience I translate these terms in this context as 'elder brother' and 'younger brother'. 154</page><page sequence="15">Simon Harrison from him, particularly after their father's death. Succession to all forms of status is governed by adelphic seniority: an elder brother must marry before his younger brother; a younger brother cannot be promoted into any initiatory grade before his elder brother; and a younger brother should allow his elder brother to gain proficiency in magic and esoteric mythology before he does so himself. In describing alata and esculenta as elder and younger brother, it is this status difference that is being referred to: alata is superior to esculenta in ritual value, just as Avatip and the river are superior to the Numbundu and the bush. But the distinction between elder and younger brother is not simply one of social status but also one of time: in their birth-order in the case of uterine brothers, or in the order of their parents' marriages in the case of patrilateral half-brothers. Time always remains an integral part of the relationship between them: a constant time differential should be main- tained between the advancement of each in social status. The cultivation of the river and bush gardens involves an analogous time differential. The Avatip year, as I described above, is considered to start with the firing of the river gardens, and the firing of the bush gardens follows some four months later. Each stage of the bush garden cycle, from the firing to the harvest, is staggered about four months behind the equiva- lent stage in the river garden schedule. In Avatip time-reckoning, the cultivation of the river gardens proceeds first and the bush gardens follow after. As well as the idiom of elder and younger brother, alata are some- times referred to as ambandu (lit. 'the man at the head'), 'the pre- eminent one', 'the one who goes first', and esculenta as kwuker, 'the lesser one', 'the one who goes behind'. Now when the harvest of the river gardens takes place early in the wet season, some eight months have passed since the last harvest - the harvest of the previous bush garden crop. For this reason there is normally little chance of river and bush tubers coming into contact with each other during this mid-year transition from dry to wet. When the river gardens are harvested, all the bush tubers have either been consumed or else are in storage in the Amoku River yam-houses reserved as seed- yams for replanting. Over the transition from the wet to the dry season, on the other hand, the two harvests follow each other in quick succession, only some four months apart. The river gardens are first harvested early in the wet, and then the bush gardens are harvested at the very start of the dry. It is during this important transition - not simply from wet to dry but from the old year to the new - that contact between the two types of yam is most likely to occur and the taboos against this are most in evidence. When the bush yams - the food for the forthcoming dry season and the start of a new year - become available for consumption, the river tubers - representing the food for the wet season which ended the old year - are in the village yam-houses and usually still in the process of being con- sumed. The passage from the old year to the new is the mystically most dangerous period in the Avatip calendar, for it is during this intestitial period that 'fighting' between the two types of yam is most likely to happen as a result of the fact that the 'younger brother' tubers reach maturity while the 'elder brother' yams are still being eaten. There is a special procedure which each household adopts in order to prevent mixture of yams during the transition. A household normally postpones bringing bush yams into the village until all its remaining river 155</page><page sequence="16">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time yams have been eaten or planted and the village, as people say, 'is empty of river yams'. They of course begin harvesting the bush tubers as soon as they are mature, but they keep them in the bush garden yam-houses; and if they wish to consume them they do so in situ in the bush gardens themselves. Before the bush tubers can enter the village, people say, these yams must wait until the river tubers have 'made way' or 'opened the path' for them: the younger brothers cannot take occupancy of the village until their elder brothers have vacated it, in the same way that adelphic seniority governs succession to status in human social life. The transition from one year to the next is a period of danger both for the well-being of the community and for the preservation of a number of important conceptual oppositions connected with the classification of time. These dichotomies are preserved by translating them into an entirely spatial idiom: by keeping the bush yams in the Amoku River gardens as long as river tubers still remain in the village, the contrast between wet and dry seasons is transposed into the opposition between river and bush, wet and dry terrain. Yam Cultivation and the Age-grade System The ceremony which inaugurates the agricultural schedule at the start of the year is held by five hereditary ritual leaders caled simbuk, each of whom is the head of a ceremonial division known as a laki. Each simbuk and the men of his laki hold a feast of yams, during which all the male children born during the previous year are inducted into these divisions, usually into the same laki as their fathers. At the same time, an age-grade is formed: all the male children inducted into the laki system on the same occasion form an age-grade. If an age-grade has only a few members, it may in fact later be amalgamated with one adjacent to it, but in theory each age-grade consists of all the individuals born in the same year. Women too belong to the age-grade organization, but they are not inducted into laki, which are exclusively male ritual associations. Male age-mates refer to each other as nawindu; they call the grades senior to them their ma'amungkwusQ, 'the grades of the elder brothers', and the grades junior to them their nyamusungkwurd, 'the grades of the younger brothers'. The age-grade system is a kind of generalization of the elder brother-younger brother relationship, a sociocentric organization modelled after the distinction between senior and junior siblings. In principle, a man's social status increases automatically with age and, as with siblings, each age-grade is formally senior in status to its juniors. A man's companions and commensals tend to be his age-mates, so that an age-grade usually forms a closely-knit group. When food is served after a collective task such as house-building, the men eat in separate groups according to age-grade, and each grade is served its own portion. Men of different grades dislike eating together because, it is said, this kind of close contact between seniors and juniors would weaken the seniors and accelerate their ageing. It is mystically hazardous for elder and younger age-grades to eat together, in the same way as it is for the senior and junior yams to be cooked together. The principal activity which people associate with age-grade organiza- tion is brawling: in the past, fighting was an institutionalized feature of relations between adjacent grades. It was treated as a form of training for warfare and therefore encouraged. Brawls needed little or no provocation. Sometimes age-grades fought over women: each grade was expected to marry before any of their juniors, and if any anticipated them, the seniors 156</page><page sequence="17">Simon Harrison would assert their rights by provoking a brawl. On other occasions, they fought over food at feasts: if one grade considered that the grade junior to it had been served more or better food than itself, this too would normally lead to a brawl. Sometimes, age-grades would fight for no better reason than sheer excitement. An important point is that the focus of this aggression was the relation- ship between adjacent grades. There was no segmentary principle, such as Evans-Pritchard (1940:255) describes for the Nuer age- set system, by which two adjacent sets would fuse in relation to a third. It would have been improper for men of very different ages to brawl, because of the respect which juniors owe their seniors: the status difference between them is too great. It was, therefore, only between proximate grades - very near equals, with only a minimal status differential - that fighting took place. Essentially, brawling occurred as an attempt by one age-grade to reassert its seniority following a real or imagined challenge to it by the grade immediately junior. It was a response to a threat not simply to a dis- tinction in social status but to the distinction in time on which this is based. I suggested earlier that 'brawling' between the yams has the same significance. In both cases what is involved is, among other things, the jeopardizing of a specific classification of time. Fighting results from the conflation of senior and junior, and it represents the attempt to re-establish the distinction between them. When a set of male children are induoted into their age-grade and laki, the ritual leaders of their laki perform a brief magical rite over each of them: they spray them with a bespelled mixture of chewed betel-nut and ginger, and this is the formal act of induction. An important purpose of this rite is to impart, by means of ritual, a warlike disposition to the children, to give them ka'aw. Ka'aw denotes pride, aggressiveness, fighting- spirit: it is one of the central concepts in the Avatip male value system.8 In fact, the main responsibility of simbuk, the hereditary heads of the laki divisions, is to dispense fighting magic - magic to impart ka'aw - to the members of their laki throughout the latters' lives. To administer this magic is the primary function of the laki organization. The simbuk administers increasingly potent forms of fighting magic to the members of his laki on their promotion into successive initiatory grades. In the past, he also had the responsibility of dispensing this magic to them before they conducted raids. If one asks people what quality they value most in yams, they say it is ka'aw: above all else, they want their yams to be warlike and ferocious. It is this, they say, that enables the growing yam to drive itself into the ground, grow big, and resist disease and insect attack. It can be imparted to yams only through magic: all forms of magic and ritual for yams are meant to give them ka'aw. In the Avatip calendar, the first and most important of these rituals is the one I have just described. It begins the year's horticultural schedule and ensures the fertility of the entire village's yam gardens during the whole coming year. This ritual marks the end of one year's gardening and the beginning of the next: the point when the 'younger brother' yams, the year's last yam crop, are on their way into the village while the 'elder brother' yams are 8 cf. Bateson's discussion of the apparently very similar male ethos among the Iatmül (Bateson 1936). 157</page><page sequence="18">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time about to leave the village as seed yams for the new year's river gardens. It is during this interval that their paths are, as it were, most likely to cross and there is the greatest danger of their 'brawling'. The same ritual also inducts an age-grade, and so marks the point which divides one age- grade from the next, these similarly standing to each other in an elder brother-younger brother relationship. Any confusion of the elder/younger distinction between proximate grades, and between river and bush tubers, results in brawling, in one case actual and in the other imagined. Brawling signifies the temporal discontinuity between them, so that the ritual which marks this discontinuity is meant to impart fighting-spirit - the quality quintessentially expressed in brawling - to the children who are inducted and to the yams about to be planted. Yam production and the formation of age-grades are ritually synchro- nized, so that there is a kind of gearing together of what Evans-Pritchard (1940) called ecological and structural time (see Figure 2). Both have the same periodicity, cast in terms of a simple binary contrast between elder and younger brother. It is, then, a scheme based on a succession of repeated oppositions, a principle which Leach (1961:134) argues is per- haps the most elementary way of conceptualizing time. The concept of ka'aw is closely linked with Avatip ideas about anima- tion and growth. Without going into these in detail, fighting spirit is thought of as an intensification of the simple life-force, or kaiyik, which animates the body. Ka'aw is essentially a superabundance of a kind of élan vital. When the lifeforce is full, it manifests itself in the form of the self-assertiveness, physical courage, and other qualities that are summed up in the notion of ka'aw. Ka'aw, in both yams and men, is viewed simply as an intense expression of their capacity to grow and thrive, of their full- ness of lifeforce. The antagonism between alata and esculenta, and between age-grades, is seen as the natural outcome of the fact that in their process of growth they succeed one another and in so doing displace each other. Avatip time concepts revolve around the idea of an antagonism between senior and junior, elder and younger. I think one could summarize them as the notion of a continual process of violent displacement of the one by the other. It is this process of displacement, and so in a sense time itself, which is perpetuated in the annual ritual dispensation of fighting spirit to the year's new yams and the year's new age-grade. The creation of age-grades is an irreversible process, and senior/junior relations between grades are transitive; the sets in principle extend in- definitely into the past in increasing seniority and, potentially, into the future in increasing juniority. Yam gardening, on the other hand, is a closed cycle begun and completed each year, a continual repetition of the pattern eB/yB/eB/yB (see Figure 2). River yam crops and bush yam crops follow each other in alternation, so that brawling between them is a periodic event, likely to occur only for a short interval each year. Age- grades, however, permanently co-exist and brawling is a permanent feature of the relations between them. The disjunctions between successive years, which brawling signifies, are represented synchronically in the case of age- grades in the institutionalized aggression between them. A new age-grade is formed during the annual yam-brawling period, which marks the transi- tion from one year to another and the division between one grade and another. Yet, once formed, proximate grades continue regularly to re- enact this brawling as they move together through time. 158</page><page sequence="19">Simon Harrison , ^^ - iyB//eB| |yB//eBi » age-grades &gt;&gt; Fîg. 2 Synchronism of the yam -gardening schedule and the age-grade system While ecological time, as Evans-Pritchard wrote, is perceived as cycli- cal, and structural time as progressive (Evans-Pritchard 1940:95), they are in phase with each other and move to the same tempo. It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss fully the significance which yams have in ritual and in exchange; but essentially their value is based on the belief that, of all foods, they are the closest approximation to human beings. It is summed up in the expression: 'When we eat yams we are eating the flesh and blood of men'. Various mystical ties, as I have described, are thought to exist between yams and their cultivators. Gardening involves an intense degree of magical and kinaesthetic participation in every stage of the yams' growth. Yams are believed to be animate and, like men, their paramount attribute is their ka'aw, or fighting-spirit. The synchronism of yam production and the age-grade system is one of the ways in which yams and human beings are identified with each other, and therefore one of the ways in which the symbolic value of yams is maintained. Before European contact Avatip was politically autonomous and was chronically at war with most of its neighbours. Aggression was directed mainly against the Amoku River Numbundu, as I have explained. In the past, homicide and the taking of trophy-heads were important avenues to prestige, and entitled men to special prerogatives and insignia. The culture is one which places a high value on aggression and still continues to do so9. It is possible to see in the belief in brawling between river and bush tubers a symbolic reference to the hostility between Avatip and the Num- bundu. The same can I think be said of brawls between age-grades: as a form of training for warfare, a brawl was in a sense a miniature mock- battle between Avatip and its enemies, of whom the Numbundu were the archetype. At any rate, there is clearly a connexion of some sort between the village's traditionally hostile relations with its neighbours, the central place of the concept of ka'aw in the male ethos, and the aggressive imagery in which disjunctions in time are symbolized. In this paper I have dealt only with the symbolism of the annual cycle. Yet a second periodicity is recognized - a generational one - and this has an equally important place in Avatip symbolism. In this generational cycle, which I hope to discuss in detail elsewhere, the nature of time is conceptualized in essentially the same way as in the annual cycle. The notion of conflict between adjacent generations pervades Avatip kinship organization. The rise of each new generation is seen as a threat in certain respects to the one that produced it, each generation having eventually to dispossess the one above it of its authority. This idea is most dramatically expressed in the cycle of male initiatory rituals, which takes one generation to complete. The ritual cycle culminates in the induction 9 Nowadays, this aggression is expressed in inter-village sorcery feuds, sports contests and, occasionally, fist-fights; it continues to be dramatically portrayed, as formerly, in male ritual. 159</page><page sequence="20">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time of the novices into the third and highest ritual grade by the men of their fathers' generation, who then retire from active ritual life. The focal event in the ritual is a struggle between the initiators and novices for the control of the most important ritual sacra: what is enacted is the idea that the ritual authority of the seniors must be forcibly wrested away from them by their juniors. These two cycles make up the general framework of Avatip conceptions of time: an annual cycle connected with yam-gardening and the age-grade system, and expressed as the regular displacement of elder brothers by their younger brothers; and a generational cycle linked to the male cult and the system of initiatory grades, and represented as the displacement of fathers by their sons. Conclusion: a Comparison with Malu and Yuanamb I mentioned earlier that there are two Manambu-speaking communities upriver from Avatip; these, Malu and Yuanamb, are offshoots from Avatip dating from some six generations ago according to genealogical tradition. They are both much smaller than Avatip, their combined populations being less than that of their parent village. They do not have access to large areas of land off the river and are hemmed in by dense Numbundu populations, as a result of which they cultivate river gardens alone. As at Avatip, yam cultivation is inaugurated each year in a ritual in which an age-grade is simultaneously formed, and in which ka'aw is magically imparted to the new age-grade and to the yams. Yam produc- tion and the age-grade system are in other words synchronized and sym- bolically identified with each other just as they are at Avatip. And, as at Avatip, brawling between the grades was in the past institutionalized. But the point is that the dichotomy of river and bush gardens, and of alata and esculenta as elder and younger brother, simply does not exist; and as a result the equation between yam production and the age-grade system takes a rather simpler form. For there is no senior/junior relation- ship between alata and esculenta, no taboo on contact between them, and no belief that they brawl. Secondly, a number of symbolic oppositions which form part of this complex at Avatip do not do so in the case of Malu and Yuanamb, but are more or less unconnected with it: for example, there is no difference in ritual importance between alata and esculenta, even though the notion of differential ritual value exists in many other contexts; similarly with the dichotomies of wet season and dry season, river and dry land, themselves and the Numbundu. These opposi- tions are altogether as conceptually important as they are at Avatip, but they are not - as they are at Avatip - expressed together in the form of an alata/ esculenta river garden/bush garden contrast. There is in other words simply an annual yam cultivation cycle geared to the formation of age-grades, one age-grade and one yam crop being produced each year: a scheme conveying exactly the same 'message' as that at Avatip, but in a more elementary form. I suggested earlier that the system of yam gardening now practised at Malu and Yuanamb was originally also practised at Avatip before its expansion into the Amoku River bushland in the nineteenth century. Malu and Yuanamb probably broke away from Avatip long before this period; and it is possible that they carried this system with them and have since preserved it in a territorial situation analogous to that of Avatip 160</page><page sequence="21">Simon Harrison prior to its displacement of the Numbundu. It is likely then that the forms of symbolic classification I have just described for Malu and Yuanamb, or something very like them, originally also existed at Avatip; and that it was not until its territorial expansion began that these were elaborated into their present form. This expansion permitted the diversification of the Avatip economy to which I referred earlier. It is probable that these processes accompanied a growth of village population, accounting for its large size at the present time. One effect of the displacement of the Numbundu was that it became possible to make yam gardens on the Amoku; and these were used for the cultivation of esculenta while the original river gardens were reserved for alata. The practice of cultivating alata in separate gardens is, as I noted before, followed by a number of the land-based Ndu-speaking societies, and it is likely that Avatip imitated them - perhaps even the Amoku River Numbundu themselves. In short, it is likely that a set of inter- related changes took place at Avatip in the nineteenth century: territorial expansion, a shift away from a purely riverine economy, growth in popu- lation, and the elaboration of the symbolic complex connected with yam cultivation. It is possible to make a few deductions about the interplay of practical and purely ideological factors which led to this complex taking its present form. Given that Avatip is able to make bush gardens, the only time of year at which their cultivation can begin is late in the dry, because of the environmental conditions I described earlier. The other basic characteris- tics of the gardening schedule follow from this: that the river garden crop is eaten in the wet season and the bush garden crop during the dry; that their harvests follow each other some four months apart over the transi- tion from the old year to the new; and that the bush garden harvest begins when the river gardens are about to be planted. These conditions can be regarded as the only ones more or less imposed by practical necessity. They are the raw materials on which the symbolic elaborations at Avatip have been made. These elaborations seem to be of two kinds, as I suggested above. First, the distinction of river and bush gardens is used to express a number of other pre-existing dichotomies: one garden is allocated to alata and the other to esculenta; a lesser ritual importance is attached to the bush gardens so that a differential in ritual value is set up between the two species; alata is explicitly associated with the river, the village and with consumption during the wet season, and esculenta with dry land, the Numbundu and consumption in the dry. In this way a set of previously more or less unconnected dual classifications are integrated with each other. Secondly, the distinction between river and bush gardens, and between alata and esculenta, is used to create a number of further analogies between yam production and the age-grade system: the two yam species are described as senior and junior, in accordance with their order of cultivation; a ritual antipathy is posited between them and they are thought to brawl if they come into contact - their main brawling period, when the old year's bush gardens are being harvested and the new year's river gardens about to be prepared, being the interval in which each age- grade is formed. There are two points I would like to draw out from this comparison with Malu and Yuanamb. First, the difference between Avatip and the other two Manambu villages in the symbolic complex I have described is essentially a difference simply in the degree of their closure and redund- 161</page><page sequence="22">Yams and the Symbolic Representation of Time ancy - that is, in their effectiveness in conveying essentially the same information. The Avatip bricoleur has merely taken further than his Malu and Yuanamb counterparts the same basic system of ideas. Second, it was a change in the mode of subsistence that provided him with the means of doing so. None of them were working in a vacuum; but rather with the specific set of possibilities and constraints offered by their differing his- torical and economic circumstances. References Bateson, G.
