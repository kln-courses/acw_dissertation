<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes Fires threaten Tikal ruins LOUISVILLE (Aztlan/R. Wilk). Since April, 2000 a number of fires have been raging in the 576 square kilométré reserve of the Tikal National Park in Guatemala, primarily in the park's southwest quadrant. These fires have threatened an cient Maya sites as well as the area's wildlife. Park personnel have battled the blazes with very few resources. Of particular importance was the natural biological corridor that the Peten shares with Belize. A large area of dévastation can seriously threaten the biodiversity that the corridor enhances. At the beginning of May fires were also burning in Belize from Rio Hondo to Sarstoon, making the oppressively hot dry season even more uncomfortable. Some of the fires were deliberately set to clear land for milpa farming while many others are wildfires which can rage for days across miles of territory. Projected Mexican Law of Cultural Patrimony meets with firm résistance MEXICO CITY /LA PAZ (El loro/El Diario/M. Amparo Lasso). A projected law on the cultural patrimony of Mexico has provoked an ongoing storm of protest: archaeologists, stu dents, journalists, politicians and guerrillas, to name but a few, are fighting the PRI regime's attempts to privatize the nation' s cultural héritage. Presented to the Senate on April 28, 1999 with the endorsement of ail political parties as a replace ment for the existing law, the projected law has become the object of broadsides and activism, including protest marches, public forums, articles and essays in the press and discussion forums on the Internet, such as the electronic list "el loro" of INAH investigators. It has rarely been the case that so many varied sectors of society have taken a stand with regard to the law. Subcomandante Marcos, a leader of the Zapatista guer rilla movement in Chiapas, has also issued a communique, in which he states: "History is not for sale and we are united in our struggle to defend it." The new projected law, 28 pages in length, confers rights on states and municipios with regard to the protection and management of the cultural héritage. It aims to promote private initiative and reform of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH), which up to now has en joyed a virtual monopoly on the préservation of cultural treasures. To replace INAH a new decentralized public entity is to be created under the auspices of the Secrétariat of Public Education. This entity is to bring together also other bodies connected with the cultural patrimony. According to the text, the law encourages the participation of Citizens and relates for the first time the cultural patrimony to human Settlements, urban development and the protection of the environment. Its main promoter, Mauricio Fernández Garza, right-wing Sena tor from the Partido Acción Nacional, insists that the initia tive has the endorsement of all Senators and promises to organize a national Council before its ratification. However, critics, who point out that the law was drawn up without the backing of society and in a secretive, authoritarian manner, label it an "auction-sale law" for the patrimony. One of the most controversial points is the plan to issue concessions with regard to the use and commercialization of properties to "physical and moral institutions and persons". "It does not take much to imagine what could happen if some corporation like Coca Cola with its ample economic muscle were author ized to use, dispose of and watch over, for example, the ruins of Monte Alban", warned analyst Gilberto López y Rivas. The authors of the law answer that privatization is not being promoted and that it provides in a number of sections for sanctions of up to 10 years imprisonment for illegal excava tion, commercial transactions, export, use and transport of cultural treasures. The principal opponents come from INAH itself. Union ized workers at the Institute believe that the law intends to "concéntrate cultural treasures in the hands of a few", ignor ing "the interests of indigenous peoples" and putting "in the hands of politicians matters that require specialists". INAH trade-unionists have vowed that they will continue to protest actively. Organized in the Frente Nacional para la Defensa del Patrimonio Cultural, they have carried out protest marches in the Mexican capital. Düring the UNAM strike in 1999 stu dents also were involved in the protest and organized a campaign to gather signatures of those against the law. The debate has now reached the Senate, where previously una nimity reigned. Although the opposition party Revolución Democrática (PRD) subscribed to the accord in principie, it has now attacked it as "anticonstitutional, limited and elitist" and as a promoter of the privatization of the cultural legacy. Currently, a variety of forums are taking place so that specialists and Citizens can detect loopholes, omissions, er rors and erroneous concepts in the draught. Meanwhile, the cultural authorities are cautious and insisting on the necessity of major discussion. For now it appears improbable that the new law will be approved before the 2000 general élections [in July 2]. A new archaeological muséum in Antigua, Guatemala GRAZ (Karl H. Mayer). In the ex-convent of Santo Domingo in the town of Antigua Guatemala a new muséum displaying Precolumbian artifacts from various régions of Guatemala was opened recently. The Santo Domingo convent was founded in 1642 andpresently houses in its exten sive ruins the luxury hotel Casa Santo Do mingo and now also a muséum devoted to the Precolumbian past of Guatemala. Objects on exhibit in this small but interestingMuseo Arqueológico come from a private collec tion and encompass lithic and ceramic artifacts dating from the Preclassic, Clas sic, and Postclassic Fig. 1.

All of the objects are of unknown provenance, but stylistically the majority comes from the South Coast of Guatemala, some pièces are from the Quiche région and several items are apparently from the department of the Peten. As with all objects of unknown provenance, the authenticity of a few examples may be questioned. Among the stone artifacts is a large-sized monolith depicting on its four vertical surfaces human faces, very similiar in its composition to Kaminaljuyu Monument 10, three ceremonial hachas (Fig. 1), and a so-called mushroom stone. The ceramic collections consist of several anthropomorphic, male (Fig. 2) and female, and zoomorphic figurines, obviously stemming from the Tiquisate région, three large Classic period funerary urns in the Quiche-style, a Postclassic plumbate sculpture, several monochrome and polychrome, as well as carved Peten-style plates, bowls and cylindrical vessels. A few of the ceramics show Maya hieroglyphs. One of the Late Classic cylindrical Fig. 3. A codex style ceramic vessel portraying a deity head (Photo: K. H.

Haies (see: The Maya Book oftheDead: The Ceramic Codex, Charlottesville, 1981:222 223). Moreover, there is also a large ceramic vessel from Colonial times on exhibit.

At Antigua Guate mala another new muséum was inaugurated in March 2000, named "Colección 2000". This extraordinary muséum exhib its more than 250 Precolumbian archaeological artifacts of stone and ceramics from all over Guatemala, all legally registered by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia. The primary importance of this muséum is the high quality and in some examples the uniqueness of several Precolumbian objects. For many years the Directors of the Guatemala Glass Company (VIGUA) have been collecting and purchasing modern cry stal or glass pieces that have some similarity with Precolumbian art objects; finally more than 400 archaeological works were collected, also with the inten tion of preserving them in Guatemala.
