<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOTEMISM, ANIMISM AND NORTH ASIAN INDIGENOUS ONTOLOGIES MORTEN A. PEDERSEN Cambridge University This article examines the extent to which new theories of animism advanced by Descola and Viveiros de Castro are consistent with the indigenous ontologies of North Asia. Based on a survey of North Asian ethnography and on fieldwork in Mongolia and Siberia, it is proposed that an analytical distinction between animist and totemist modalities will shed light on indigenous ontologies in North Asia. Whereas the ontologies of Northern North Asia (NNA) are predominantly animistic in nature, the ontologies of Southern North Asia (SNA) are predominantly totemistic. This opposition falls in line with established anthropo- logical distinctions concerning North Asian societies, such as the one between 'horizontally' and 'vertically' organized social formations. Finally, adopting Viveiros de Castro's notion of 'perspectivism', I address the question of why, when perspectivist notions seem to thrive in NNA, the societies of SNA do not show them. This aim of this article is to show how different indigenous ontologies of North Asia can be described and compared through the three analytical categories of animism, totemism, and perspectivism. I seek to contribute to the recent revival of the animism debate within anthropology (Bird-David 1999; Descola 1992; 1996; Ingold 1998; Stringer 1999; Viveiros de Castro 1998), and aim to provide insights into a theme largely neglected by anthro- pology, namely the comparative study of the indigenous societies of North Asia. The indigenous societies of North Asia range from former deeply hie- rarchical tribal empires of the Mongolian grasslands to the current small egalitarian bands of reindeer-breeding hunters traversing the wilderness of Northern Siberia. Indeed, a geographical as well as cultural opposition between Northern North Asia (NNA) and Southern North Asia (SNA) is crucial for my argument. Partly following Levin and Potapov (1964), I see NNA as encompassing the extremely sparsely populated taiga and tundra regions of both Northeastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. Its indigenous people belong primarily to the palaeo-Asiatic language group (e.g. the Itelmen, the Koryak, the Chukchi, and the Yukaghir), but also include people of the Tungoso-Manchurian (e.g. the Even, the Evenki) and the Turkic language group (i.e. the Tuvans, the Yakut). SNA includes the steppe regions of the Mongolian Plateau as well as the forest-steppes of its northern fringe, such as the South Siberian Transbaikal region. The indigenous peoples of SNA belong primarily to the Ural-Altaic language group (e.g. the Halx, the Darxad, ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2001. J Roy. anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 7, 411-427</page><page sequence="2">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN and the Buriat), but also to the aforementioned Turkic language group (e.g. the Altays). This article must be seen as a somewhat bold attempt at a synthesis of a pool of quite different societies and locations, drawing on ethnographic descriptions from different historical periods. Much of the basis for my ana- lyses originates from the beginning of the twentieth century, another large set of data is of quite recent date, while very little information stems from the middle period, that of state Communism. This is mainly due to the re- strictions imposed on scholars during this period. While all of the indi- genous people mentioned have been subject to various forms of Communist political economy and state power, as well as earlier Russian and Chinese (Manchurian) imperial colonialism, some have remained largely independent (such the Halx of the present-day Mongolian Republic), while others (such as the Yukaghir of Northeastern Siberia) have been under a constant threat of assimilation, not only from colonizing states, but also from stronger indige- nous groups (e.g. the Yakut). So we must accept a certain level of generalization to reach the level of synthesis aspired to here. Regardless of the actual historical period described, I shall use the ethnographic present. Also, when I refer to a particular group or aspects of their social life, for the sake of clarity and brevity I shall gloss over most of the internal differences that are present - unless, of course, these are pertinent. Finally, and perhaps most problematically, I shall have to leave out an important issue, the effect that over 300 years of Russian, Chinese, and Manchurian presence in North Asia has had on conceptualizations of human and nonhuman social life. All this being said, the present analytical task is still worth undertaking. Few attempts have been made to generalize over the entire body of North Asian social life (notably Ingold 1980; 1986; Hamayon 1990; 1994). Inspired by Descola's (1992; 1996) andViveiros de Castro's (1998) recent general discus- sion of the Amerindian Amazon, and by Levi-Strauss's (1962; 1964) legendary synthesis of Aboriginal Australia and beyond, I attempt to establish two gov- erning modalities of the native ontologies of North Asia by both 'Amazoniz- ing' and 'Australizing' aspects of the social life of this region of the world. According to Descola, animism is a fundamental modality of human thought and action, alongside two other modalities, totemism and naturalism. Descola's (1996: 87-8) discussion of the relationship between the animist and totemic modes marks my point of departure. While totemic classifications make use of empirically observable discontinuities between natural species to organise, conceptually, a segmentary order delimiting social units (Levi-Strauss 1962 [1964]), animism endows natural beings with human dispositions and social attributes. Animic systems are thus a symmetrical inversion of totemic classifications: they do not exploit the differential relations between natural species to confer a conceptual order on society, but rather use the elementary categories structuring social life to organ- ise, in conceptual terms, the relations between human beings and natural species. In totemic systems non-humans are treated as signs, in animic systems they are treated as the term of a relation. My overall hypothesis is that both these two modalities lie behind all North Asian ontologies, but to different degrees and in different ways among NNA 412</page><page sequence="3">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN and SNA societies. Therefore, I need first to sketch animist beliefs in North Asia. Having done that, I will be in a position to single out what I take to be the fundamental principle of the animist modality, namely that of analo- gous identification. Following that, I will go through the same process as regards the totemist modality, first pointing out the existence of totemism as a North Asian ethnographic phenomenon, and then outlining its properties as a prime motor of North Asian ontologies. Following Levi-Strauss, I will call this principle 'homologous differentiation'. First, however, I must clarify what I mean by 'ontology', and how this is related to my use of'animism' and 'totemism'. Basically, I use ontology in its straightforward philosophical sense, as theories or understandings about what exists. Like Western philosophers engaged in metaphysical speculation,Yukaghir hunters and Mongolian pastoralists deal with the question of being, perhaps not so much through rigorous philosophical scrutiny as through social practices such as making sacrifices to the spirit-owners of wild animals or carrying out shamanist ceremonies for sick family members. By using the term in the plural, 'ontologies', I am opening up the possibility that not all human beings share the same ontology. If unwilling to promote a full-blown relativist stance, I do remain sceptical about whether North Asians share a 'Western naturalist ontol- ogy [where] the nature/society interface is natural' (Viveiros de Castro 1998: 473). Indeed, as I shall show, for the ontologies of both NNA and SNA, 'the space between nature and society is itself social' (1998: 473). The main difference between NNA and SNA ontologies, I propose, lies in whether the topology of the particular 'space' constituted by humans and nonhumans amounts to a boundless whole (animism) or to a bounded grid (totemism). The issue at stake, therefore, is really one of social ontology, but it should be kept in mind that the social is here not confined to the domain of human beings. Indeed, the proposed tension in North Asian societies between animist and totemist modalities is primarily a heuristic tool for analysing why social ontologies vary as one moves from NNA to SNA. Thus, here I take neither totemism nor animism as ontologies in their own right. Rather, I take them as two analytical categories, which I use to identify the different ontological principles through which NNA and SNA peoples organize their societies of humans and nonhumans. Animist identification in North Asia It is neither novel (cf. Bogoraz 1909: 277; Heissig 1980) nor contentious to say that the people of North Asia are animist. Consider, for example, the belief of the pastoralist Darxad Mongols that mountains have spirit-'owners' (ezed), with whom local people have to engage in a respectful manner, or the wide- spread North Asian belief in the human-like characteristics of the bear (e.g. Bogoraz 1909: 283-4; Ingold 1998: 185;Willerslev 2001). In his ethnography on the reindeer-herding Chukchi of Far East Siberia, the Russian explorer Bogoraz (1909: 281) writes: everything has its own voice (ge'mge-kuli'lin) or its own master (ga'mga-etr'nvilin). Skins ready for sale have a 'master' of their own. In the night-time they turn into reindeer and walk to 413</page><page sequence="4">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN and fro. The trees in the forest talk to one another. Even the shadows on the wall consti- tute definite tribes and have their own country where they live and subsist by hunting. 'Everything has its own voice', Bogoraz says, but what does that actually mean? One could produce numerous similar passages from various North Asian ethnographies and travel accounts, and use them to underscore a Tylorian definition of animism, implying that, for the native peoples of North Asia, all natural objects and phenomena have souls (but see Stringer 1999 for another interpretation of what Tylor meant). This would render North Asian people animist in the classical sense of the term, that 'century-old' concep- tion which 'amazingly ... appears revised little if at all' (Bird-David 1999: 67). But North Asian animism is not simply a belief in nonhuman souls, and it is not the case that all natural objects and phenomena are endowed with spiritual power all the time. Although a basic distinction between the 'cover' and the 'interior' (Jochelson 1908: 115; Ingold 1998: 194) of a given entity seems to persist across the region, it would be wrong to equate this distinc- tion with the Western one between body and soul. The main reason for this is that, both between different North Asian societies and within each of them, there are multiple and contradictory conceptions of what this interior aspect of a given nonhuman entity might be (cf.Viveiros de Castro 1998: 471). For some entities (most often wild animals, notably the bear), this quality certainly is very soul-like or human-like, but for other entities (such as, say, a cooking- fire) the interior aspect is seen as one instance among many of a more abstract spiritual quality (e.g. the fire spirit). Furthermore, and importantly, not every entity is endowed with such an interior spiritual quality, nor is this quality necessarily present in a given entity at all times (see below). Summing up the heterogeneous animistic beliefs of the Daur Mongols of the Manchurian and Inner Mongolian forest-steppes, Humphrey (1996: 85, emphasis added) proposes that, far from having a soul, What everything had had was its own kind of indeterminate energy ... [which was] corre- lated with what a particular entity looked like and its place in the landscape ... [This idea] allowed people to talk about the inner or concealed power of entities in the world and to have human-like intentional relations with them. If we take this statement as representative for the general North Asian picture, two things become clear. First, North Asian animism has less to do with homogeneous belief in nonhuman souls than with heterogeneous per- ceptions (cf. Ingold 1996) of a potential interior spiritual quality in things. Secondly, since most North Asian people do perceive things as having such interior qualities, and since such perceptions do usually involve endowing the given thing with anthropomorphic characteristics (Bird-David 1998: 76), it is fair to infer that the North Asia social realm is made up by both human and nonhuman beings (Humphrey 1996; Pedersen 1998;Willerslev 2001).This second point is of most interest here. This is because, whereas the first point addresses the content of North Asian cosmologies, the latter has to do with the form within which a given cosmology acquires its shape; that is to say, the particular 'mode of identification' (Descola 1996: 87) through which humans engage with nonhumans. 414</page><page sequence="5">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN Before going deeper into these matters, let me first look at some of the many cases of human-nonhuman social interaction in North Asia. Examples range from a governor of nineteenth-century Ulaanbaatar, who punished the sacred mountain Bogd Uul with a public whipping because the mountain had failed to fulfil its obligation to provide good weather (Humphrey 1995: 146), to the ongoing encounters between North Asian hunters and the spirits of the game which they pursue. The reindeer-breeding Tsaatang in Northern Mongolia, among whom I have worked, often told me about a deal they struck with the bears: if a Tsaatang hunter successfully tracks down a bear, and if the bear then in desperation crawls up into a Siberian larch (xar mod), then the hunter should refrain from killing the bear and simply walk away, leaving the bear with a sufficiently face-saving means of escape. The oppo- site, obviously, happens when any member of the Tsaatang camp walks in the taiga alone and unarmed, and is unlucky enough to meet a bear. In this case, the unfortunate person is well advised to climb any Siberian larch sufficiently high to keep the bear out of reach, and then just sit still, hoping that the bear will keep its part of the deal. The next example, from Yukaghir hunters from Northeastern Siberia, not only demonstrates how sacrifice is an exchange practice central to the repro- duction of human-nonhuman sociality (Hamayon 1994; Ingold 1986), it also points to a core feature of the Russian colonization of Siberia: 'Masters' of the forest are, in the Russo-Yukaghir conception, exceedingly fond of drinking brandy and of playing cards. Even now those hunters who are most successful in trapping are reputed by the Russianised natives to have bought their luck from the 'master' of the forest with brandy and packs of cards. The 'masters' of the forests are constantly playing cards with one another. The stake is some species of game, which may then have to pass from one to another after the play is over. This accounts for the migration of game (Bogoraz 1909: 287-8). Slightly recasting Descola's definition,Viveiros de Castro (1998: 473) defines animism as 'an ontology which postulates the social character of relations between humans and nonhumans: the space between nature and society is itself social'. This definition clearly fits the North Asian case, since, as we have seen, the realm of the social does not end with human beings; rather, it knows no ending. So, to put it rather simply, instead of having one nature encom- passing many human societies, we are confronted with one society of both humans and nonhumans encompassing, as it were, many natures. Also, while people in North Asia clearly distinguish between humans and nonhumans (Humphrey 1996;Willerslev 2001), this distinction cannot be collapsed onto that more fundamental division between intentional persons and unintentional things. The picture is complicated, however, by the fact that, just as some people are unfortunate enough to lose their soul, temporarily or for good, many animals and objects are, at any given moment, devoid of any interior quality. So, if North Asian animism allows for a limitless, total socialization of the world in principle, in practice this is only a tendency, because the totality will invariably be ruptured by countless asocial entities, thus giving rise to a cosmology strangely reminiscent of a Swiss cheese.' These ruptures, these holes in the cheese, are purely external, natural 'things' that have no mutual 415</page><page sequence="6">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN animistic relations, because they do not share any common social ground. While the hunter and the bear exchange their meat and sacrifices in the same social world, what is the relation between, say, a small grey stone and a piece of peeled wild onion? It seems, therefore, that whereas there is only one social world (shared by human and nonhuman persons alike), there is an infinite number of asocial locations, each inhabited by a non-person entirely left in its own void (hole), and hence totally disconnected from its fellow non-social entities, or things. Nature, as we know it, exists in North Asian animism, but not as a unified and unifying whole. Rather, the uniting factor is a super- sociality that weaves together persons of all sorts, be they humans, animals, or spirit entities. The basic shape of North Asian animist cosmology, therefore, is a whole with holes in it. Since animism 'conceptualises a continuity between humans and non- humans' (Descola 1996: 89), it seems to both imply and be implied by wider societal relations of a horizontal character. If people cannot perceive them- selves as potentially being in the shoes of others, if people cannot imagine themselves as Others (whether human or nonhuman) and Others as them- selves, then the very basis for animism is likely to break down because its ontological principle depends on an unbounded potential for identification. Indeed, a logic of endless substitutions seems intrinsic to animist thought, the principle that every element belonging to the whole (apart from its holes) can be interchanged with another. There are no radical discontinuities here, only continuous substitutions of Same becoming Other, and vice versa. The fundamental animist principle, I therefore propose, is one of analogous identification. I use 'analogous identification'' to stress that we are not faced with full identifications here, but only with partial ones. Obviously, North Asian people do not generally walk around regarding themselves as, say, wild reindeer and, no less obviously, a given North Asian person does not sud- denly conflate himself with another given North Asian person. What I mean, rather, is the ability to imagine oneself in someone else's position, and the ability to imagine someone else in one's own position; the scope of which imagination is in the animist case extended to include nonhuman beings.This latter ability, in fact, might be what Levi-Strauss (1964: 101) refers to when he singles out the primordial sympathetic relationship between human and beast as the only psychic state of which the content is indissociably affective and intellectual, and which the act of consciousness suffices to transfer from one level to another, viz., com- passion, or, as Rousseau also writes, identification with another, the duality of terms corresponding, up to a certain point, to the duality of aspect. Be that as it may, I suggest that, if too stark a differentiation or disconti- nuity is present in a society, then it will not be a suitable environment for animist analogous identifications, and such identifications will be displaced by another principle. In North Asia, it is reasonable to expect, animism can only really flourish where societal relations as a whole are horizontal in character. What, then, takes over from animism in North Asia as the horizontal axis tips toward the vertical one? The answer, I propose, is totemism. 416</page><page sequence="7">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN Totemist diferentiation in North Asia In this section I want to show that the central position occupied by animism in NNA ontologies is related to the predominance of horizontal relations of analogous identification in these societies and, conversely, that what seems to be the key position of totemism in SNA ontologies is correlated to the pre- dominance of vertical relations of homologous differentiation in that region. Put differently, whereas both animist and totemist phenomena are present in all North Asian societies, in any given society's ontology either animism or totemism will gain the upper hand, and the outcome will be contingent upon the given society's degree of 'verticalization'. I will begin by showing how totemism can be said to exist in North Asia, after which I shall discuss the more general question of the relationship between the animist and the totemist modality as the two blend in particular ontologies across the North Asian region. The argument for the existence of totemism in North Asia is somewhat less straightforward than was the case with animism. Although its presence has occasionally been alluded to (e.g. Even 1991;Jagchid &amp; Hyer 1979), no one, to my knowledge, has classified any North Asian society as totemist. There are several reasons for this. First, one would have to look very hard to find evi- dence in North Asia of totemism in the strict sense of the word; that is, as a particular relationship between social entities and natural species.3 Although various clan-based societies in North Asia do in fact name their clans after natural species (Cleaves 1982; Humphrey pers. comm.;Vainstein 1980), these are only emblematic and peripheral. Secondly, the concept of totemism has had a very bad press within anthropology since Levi-Strauss (1964) so con- vincingly deconstructed it nearly forty years ago. Unlike 'animism', which has remained acceptable, if not fashionable, within anthropology (but see Bird-David 1999), 'totemism' is widely taken to be illusory as a concept of universal applicability, and therefore one misleading to employ (cf. Hiatt 1969; Ingold 1998; Kessler 1971). However, totemism is not illusory in North Asia, at least in the strictly for- malist manner of Levi-Strauss. On the contrary, if one heeds Levi-Strauss's analytical lesson, then the body of North Asian ethnography swells with totemist material. All one needs to do is to look at this material with an eye to the possible existence of homologous relations of difference. Levi-Strauss famously argues that, whereas Victorian and functionalist scholars alike had mistakenly treated the problem of totemism as one of identities in content, totemism really is about identities in form. For Levi-Strauss (1964: 77), the existence of totemism is not about human affections for or identifications with natural entities, but is instead another product of the mental shuffling of binary differences: 'If we may be allowed the expression, it is not the resemblances, but the differences, which resemble each other ... The resemblance presupposed by so-called totemic representations is between ... two systems of differences.' For Levi-Strauss, then, it is not the possible (animist) identities between, say, Species A and Clan 1, or Species B and Clan 2, that matter (as both Frazer and Durkheim believed). Rather, what matters, what makes a society totemist, is the fact that the difference between Species A and Species B is similar to the difference between Clan 1 and Clan 2. 417</page><page sequence="8">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN A similar claim can be made concerning the relations between humans and nonhumans in SNA. There, the homologous sets of differences among humans and among nonhumans matter. I base this proposition on a point made by Humphrey (1996: 76), who writes that 'in Daur "shamanism" there was a broad homology between the ontology of natural objects or beings and the distinctive ritualised practises of specialists who had knowledge of them'. Consider the Table, which is a simplified version of Humphrey (1996: 56). The Table basically shows how the specific powers and abilities of dif- ferent social agents are symbolically and literally linked to the equally specialized properties of natural entities. For Humphrey, the kinds of power attributed to nonhumans on the left side correspond to domain-specific properties of human cognition (cf. Boyer 1994), just as the kinds of power attributed to humans on the right side correspond to fundamental diver- sities of social existence. Mongolian shamanism, Humphrey then goes on to argue, is basically about collapsing the boundaries between the various domains of human existence through a non-intuitive conflation of otherwise domain-specific ontological properties of natural objects. This shamanic de-naturalization enables certain entities (shamans, spirits) to undergo various metamorphoses, and thus gain the perspective of their fellow entities by a cir- cumvention of a social hierarchy which is otherwise highly rigid. Mongolian shamanism, in a sense, serves to produce a horizontal 'homunculus' within a social universe overwhelmingly vertical; an important point to which I return in my conclusions. We recognize in the Table the contours of a distinct totemist ontological principle. Clearly, this differs from the animist one in important ways. While the realm of sociality is still extended beyond humanity to include mountains, trees, animals, and the like as nonhuman persons, the realm of humanity is simultaneously cut up, thus giving rise to a cosmology very different from the Swiss cheese version characteristic of animism. There is no unifying whole here. Rather, we are confronted with a heterogeneous conglomerate of mutu- ally independent domains inhabited by humans as well as nonhumans. This is not a world laid out to perceive horizons and perhaps even go beyond them, a world devoid of boundaries and discontinuities. Rather, it is as if someone laid a grid over the world, leaving only the shamans with the ability to move between its numerous, discrete domains (see also Humphrey 1995; Pedersen 1998). Consequently, there is little room for analogous identification, since no one, apart from the shaman, can become another one. Instead, what seems to be at play are two homologous differentiations; a given human's domain differs TABLE.

PEDERSEN from those of other humans in the same way as a given nonhuman's domain differs from those of other nonhumans. Therefore, the central ontological prin- ciple among the Mongols (and, I hold, other indigenous peoples from SNA) is not animism, but totemism. In my discussion of animism in North Asia I made frequent reference to Mongolia and other SNA societies, which clearly showed the existence of animist ideas. This seems to pose a problem: how do such animist phenom- ena fit my overall conclusion as to the totemist character of SNA ontologies? Similarly, I could mention numerous examples from NNA societies showing the opposite to be true; that is, the existence of totemist ideas in ontologies supposedly governed by the animist principle. This is where the distinction between modality and reality becomes important: I do not claim that all social life in NNA is animist, nor do I view social life in SNA as the mere execu- tion of a single totemic principle. Rather, I propose that the outlined tension between the modalities of animism and totemism may clarify the rather messy ethnographic picture. What, then, might such a perspective on North Asian ethnography amount to? It does not amount to viewing SNA cosmologies as simply structural dete- riorations of an archaic shamanist principle of balanced reciprocity, one still to be found in a much purer form in NNA. Nor does it amount to regard- ing SNA pastoralist economies as degenerations of a similarly archaic hunting economy of sharing, also still to be found in NNA. I want to move away from any notion of a 'fall' taking place as one moves from the simple, hori- zontal societies of NNA to the more complex, vertical ones of SNA. So, instead of regarding the societies and ontologies of SNA as de-generated, I am much more interested in their mechanisms of self-generation (see Di Cosmo 1999; Humphrey 1994). His structuralist vocabulary notwithstanding, I there- fore find myself in sympathy with Descola's (1996: 93) claim that 'each culture, each historical episteme, articulates [metonymic and metaphoric schemes] to produce specific combinations, the nature of which vary according to the dominant type of scheme', and I would like to think that the totemist prin- ciple here outlined epitomizes a specific historical formation which one might call'the Mongolian episteme'. In North Asia, animism and totemism constitute two governing principles that, in their various combinations, map out a finite space within which each of the North Asian social ontologies can be roughly plotted. In NNA, the overall picture is one of animist analogous identification, whereas in SNA we are confronted with one of totemist homologous differentiation. Although the modalities are never manifested to an equal degree, both will always be present, which explains why, despite the fact that animist notions can be found in SNA societies and totemist ones in NNA societies, the former can right- fully be called totemic and the latter animist. Despite the tendency of different scholars to highlight different aspects of the North Asian societies, and taking into account their different theo- retical standpoints, the established wisdom concerning the differences between NNA and SNA boils down to a basic distinction between horizontal and vertical relations (Hamayon 1990; 1994; Humphrey 1994; 1995; Ingold 1980). Put simply, whereas the societies of NNA organize the world horizontally 419</page><page sequence="10">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN (through notions of charismatic leadership, egalitarian ethos, bilateral descent, direct exchange, an orally based shamanist religion, etc.), societies of SNA organize it vertically (through notions of inherited leadership, a hierarchical ethos, patrilineal descent, indirect exchange, a script-based Buddhist religion, etc.). Seen against this background, it becomes clear that I have introduced yet another analytical dichotomy, the distinction between animism and totemism, one which resonates with the established ones. Clearly, it makes sense that animist analogous identification is dominant in NNA ontologies, because this notion of the world seems to fit the overall horizontal nature of these social formations. And clearly, the overall vertical nature of the societies of SNA fits with ontologies the governing principle of which seems to rest on totemist homologous differentiation. For example, in traditional Yukaghir society, more-or-less any man is a potential leader (or shaman, or hunter), since 'social positions are meant to remain alternate' (Hamayon 1994: 81). So it also makes good sense that the Yughagir relationship to nonhuman beings works according to a principle of analogous identification. Conversely, in traditional Halx Mongol society, a given man is very likely not a potential leader (or priest or warrior), since he will be bound up in a hierarchy of patrilineal clans delineating for him a clear- cut territory to act within, in spatial, social, and existential terms. Hence, since such a man cannot identify with (imagine himself to be like) all other men, how should he identify with (imagine himself to be like) all other no-men? Much more, our man is likely to look only at the sort of no-man whose dif- ferences from his fellow no-men are homologous with those that distinguished our man from his fellow men. At this very point, our man will have become a totemist. Perspectivist exchange in North Asia In a highly innovative article, Viveiros de Castro proposes that a so-called perspectivist notion forms an essential part of most Amerindian cosmologies. Perspectivism, Viveiros de Castro (1998: 476) argues, is equally far from naturalism and culturalism, since it works according to the principle that 'the point of view creates the subject'. It follows that the presence of perspectivist beliefs in Amerindian societies reverses what Viveiros de Castro (1998: 478) regards as the Western notions of 'multiculturalism' and 'uninaturalism' into the very non-Western ones of 'uniculturalism' and 'multinaturalism'. This is because, whereas Western naturalism builds on 'the unity of nature and the plurality of cultures', perspectivism is founded upon a 'spiritual unity and cor- poral diversity' (1998: 470). In Amerindian societies, the subjectivity of humans and nonhumans is formally the same: nonhumans see the world as humans do. What they see, however, differs from what humans see, since the parti- cular media through which nonhumans see things differ from the medium through which humans see things. These media can be described as bodies. However, this is not simply the physiological body, but the 'affects, disposi- tions or capacities which render the body of every different species unique' (1998: 478). So, whereas humans and nonhumans have the soul as a subjec- 420</page><page sequence="11">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN tive form, their particular conglomerates of habitual affects render them dif- ferent from each other. Hence the remarkable notion that humans see humans as humans, animals as animals and spirits (if they see them) as spirits; however animals (predators) and spirits see humans as animals (as prey) to the same extent that animals (as prey) see humans as spirits or as animals (predators). By the same token, animals and spirits see themselves as humans: they perceive themselves as (or become) anthro- pomorphic beings when they are in their own houses or villages and they experience their own habits and characteristics in the form of culture (1998: 470). Now, asViveiros de Castro (1998: 472-4) notes, animism and perspectivism must clearly be very closely connected phenomena. I would go as far as to claim that perspectivism is a stronger version of animism. It seems to me that the conceptualization of nonhumans as persons (animism) must be a pre- requisite for the notion that nonhumans may see themselves as human sub- jects as well as see humans as nonhuman objects (perspectivism). So animism is the weaker form, and perspectivism the stronger, of human-nonhuman sociality. This conclusion opens up other potential localities of perspectivist thought, animist localities perhaps hitherto unexplored from this particular premise, amongst which is North Asia. The obvious question is, if animist ideas can be found all over North Asia, but primarily in NNA, does perspectivism also exist in North Asia? We shall see that perspectivism does exists in North Asia, but only in NNA. The further south one moves, the less one is likely to find examples of perspectivism in Viveiros de Castro's sense. However, a transformed ver- sion of perspectivism seems to thrive in SNA, namely an inter-human per- spectivism (humans becoming other humans) as opposed to the extra-human perspectivism (humans becoming nonhumans and vice versa) found in both NNA and the Amazon. In other words, as the totemist principle takes over from the animist principle in North Asian ontologies, another trans- formation occurs: inter-human perspectivism takes over from extra-human perspectivism. Jochelson (1908: 149), the famous Russian ethnographer and explorer of Siberia, writes about the Koryak of Far Eastern Siberia: The bear, the wolf, the ermine, the moose, the raven, and other birds and animals, are described as taking off their skins and becoming men, and vice versa. KIlu', a niece of Big-Raven, put on a bear-skin and turned into a bear. Eme'mqut and his wives put on wide-brimmed, spotted hats, resembling fly-agaric, and turned into these poisonous fungi. We see here a good example of North Asian perspectivism. Among the Koryak, humans can become nonhumans, and vice versa, by exchanging their own skin with that of their Others.You take on the skin of the bear and you become the bear. The bear takes on your skin, and it becomes you. But does the Other see itself as Other? Not among Amerindians, Viveiros de Castro (1998) informs us, for whom the Other will see itself as human, and thus humans as Others. Bogoraz's material from the Chukchi actually contains many examples of such a corporal grounding of the 'I' as opposed to its Other. The following (Bogoraz 1909: 295) one concerns a much-feared type of evil spirits called Ke'let: 421</page><page sequence="12">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN The ke'let are not exempt from attacks from shamans, who can deal with them in the same way as they deal with men. The ke'let, on their part, call shamans ke'let. If a 'spirit' drives with a reindeer-team and a shaman steps on the rear part of the runners of his sledge, the team will immediately stop, because the reindeer are aware of the presence of the shaman. The 'spirits', unable to understand what has happened, will seek for some natural cause. The same thing happens to men whose sledges may be stopped by 'spirits'. So the spirits drive reindeer sledges, as humans, and may be unfortunate enough to meet an evil human, as spirit, just as humans do when they drive reindeer sledges and bump into a pack of evil spirits. Indeed, 'the ke'let, on their part, call shamans ke'let'. Spooky as this is, it is also beautifully symmet- rical; it is the logic of the tail wagging the dog. Imagine a long, cold winter night on the Siberian tundra, unable to forget that the ke'let live very much like human beings, and are considered a tribe by themselves. They have vil- lages or camps, and move about the country with reindeer or dogs. They marry, and have children. Their young people go hunting and fishing, and the old men sit at home and try to read the future by the aid of divining-stones. The object of their hunts is exclusively man, whom they usually call 'a little seal'. Their divining-stone is a human skull, while men often use for this purpose the skull of some animal. It is said in a tale, - After catching a soul, they chop it to pieces, cook it in a kettle, and feed their children with it (Bogoraz 1909: 294-5). It is fair to say that the presence of perspectivism in Siberia has been well established by now. Both the Koryak and the Chukchi, however, are peoples of NNA. I have not been able to find any examples of pure perspectivist notions in SNA. This is not to say, however, that related notions of symmet- rical inversions between humans and nonhumans, or predator and prey, do not exist in SNA. For example, during my fieldwork among the Darxad Mongols, I was told that if a man goes hunting and suddenly meets, for example, a mountain antelope (bor gdoros), then everything that will happen from then on depends on who sees whom first. If the hunter (as subject) sees the antelope (as object) before the antelope (as subject) sees the hunter (as object), the episode is unproblematic and the hunter is free to kill the ante- lope. If, however, the opposite occurs, all sorts of problems arise because it is too late to back out of the situation. This occurrence means that the ante- lope is special and has power (huch). The hunter must take great care to kill the antelope in one clean shot because, if he does not, 'nature' may have an effect on him (baigalyn noloo). If the hunter misses this shot, he will need to engage a shaman (boo) or a Buddhist monk (lam hun) to have this power removed from him (for the related case from the Amazon, see Viveiros de Castro 1998: 483). While this example points to a symmetrical logic, and to an inversion of what is subject and what is object, it is not perspectivism in the strict sense. Actually, there seems here to be a tendency towards preventing any step towards such metamorphosis. As I pointed out earlier, shared alterity, and not general similarity, seems to be the preferred order of human-animal relation- ships in SNA as a whole. This differs markedly from the hunting situation among the NNA Yukaghir, amongst whom, as Willerslev (2001) remarks, a skilful hunter must allow 'a nonhuman animal Other [to] recreate him in its own image'. This is only allowed, however, because the Yukaghir hunter also 422</page><page sequence="13">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN has the ability to return unharmed to his human form, drawing 'away from [the] encounter with Otherness and reconstruct [his] self-identity as a human person'. Alternatively, if the Darxad hunter is unlucky enough to become 'infected' by a nonhuman, he must find a shaman in order to have its Otherness removed. Many similar examples of humans willing and able to exchange their own perspectives with those of nonhumans can be found in NNA, but I know of no such examples in SNA, nor can one find SNA examples of animals being able to become humans in the very 'straightforward', symmetrical way of the Koryak case. Perspectivism, in Viveiros de Castro's sense of the word, does not exist in SNA. There is, of course, one exception to this, the shaman whose very raison d'etre in all North Asian societies may be boiled down to an ability to switch between perspectives (see also Ingold 1998: 185;Viveiros de Castro 1998: 483). Basically, a shaman can be defined as a human person with the double ability to gain the perspective of another person, be that human or nonhuman, and then return un-transformed to his or her former state. We notice here the clear analogy between the practice of shamanism and that of hunting (see the Yukaghir example, above). However, there is a significant difference in the nature of the shamans' perspectivist exchanges in NNA and SNA.Whereas the spirits of the shamans in NNA are mainly nonhumans, those of the shamans in SNA are pri- marily humans, or ancestors (Even 1991: 193; Humphrey pers. comm.). That is to say, whereas NNA shamans must gain the perspective of nonhumans, shamans of SNA must gain that of other humans. However, in NNA and SNA alike, such shamanistic metamorphoses always take place with the aid of various zoomorphic spirits. Among the Daur Mongols of SNA, for example, the shaman employs two kinds of spirits, hojoor and onggor, and where the former are mostly made up by ancestors and other humans, the latter can 'take the form of wild animals, fish, or even artefacts' (Humphrey 1996: 189). Still, what Daur shamanism is essentially about 'is to manifest [the] fundamental and understandable [incidents and emotions of ordinary people] through the eyes of other people, people who [are] dead and [have] become spirits' (1996: 192, emphasis added). Thus, whereas in NNA animist societies the ultimate destination of the shaman is the nonhuman realm, in SNA totemist societies the ultimate destination of the shaman is the human realm. We have seen that the two basic terms of the North Asian perspectivist exchange undergo a transformation from being primarily human-nonhuman in NNA to being primarily human-human in SNA. As one moves across North Asia, the relative importance of human ancestor spirits and nonhuman animal spirits undergoes an inversion similar to the inversion of the internal hierarchy of animism and totemism that occurs over this region. Thus, just as animist beliefs are present in the SNA cosmologies, nonhuman spirits also play a certain role in SNA shamanism, but in neither case do they constitute the phenomena in question. Instead, the constitutive roles for cosmology and shamanism in SNA are played by totemist differentiation and human ances- tor spirits respectively. In other words, while the animist principle dominant in NNA ontologies gives rise to a primarily extra-human perspectivism, the 423</page><page sequence="14">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN totemist principle dominating SNA ontologies produces a perspectivism primarily concerned with inter-human metamorphosis. Some concluding remarks I would like to end by advancing a speculative hypothesis. ConsiderViveiros de Castro's (1998: 482-3) statement that, for the Amazon, 'if animism affirms a subjective and social continuity between humans and animals, its somatic complement, perspectivism, establishes an objective discontinuity, equally social, between live humans and dead humans'. How does this relate to North Asia? One possible answer would be that, while NNA societies, being both animist and perspectivist, relate to the dead in a way similar to the people of the Amazon,4 the totemist societies of SNA, being neither, are likely to relate to the dead in a different way. So, rather than seeing their relationship with the dead as one of objective discontinuity, the people of SNA regard it as one of objective continuity, because the people of SNA regard their relationship with nonhumans as one of social discontinuity rather than one of social continuity. What might such an objective continuity with the dead imply? It might be that the dead will relate to the living, not in the form of animate entities, but in that of inanimate entities. That is, far from taking abode in living non- human skin as animals, as in the Amazon, the deceased in SNA will dwell in dead nonhuman matter (mountains, amulets, etc.). Some of the ethnography from SNA sustains this point, particularly in the case of dead shamans. Accord- ing to Galdanova (quoted in Humphrey 1995: 151), the Buriats of Southern Siberia claim that dead shamans become cliffs (xada bolxo). But, even if it really is the case that SNA peoples' relationship to the dead shamans is objective (vis-a-vis inanimate objects), how can such a relationship be continuous? The answer probably lies in the role of the shaman as the only real 'free-mover' of the totemist societies of SNA. As the dominant totemist ontological prin- ciple of these verticalized societies ensures the confinement of people to discrete and mutually discontinuous units of existence, then it is left to the shaman, via his or her ability to break into and out of every single such unit, to re-evoke across the grid of homologous discontinuity the (animist) total- ity of analogous continuity. However, such an 'animist homunculus' within an overall totemist ontological form does not give rise to a perspectivism similar to the one implicated in the clear animist ontologies of NNA. Surrounded from all directions by social discontinuities, the SNA shaman is likely to estab- lish a continuity along a different axis of relatedness, the temporal one. And indeed, as we have seen, rather than attempting analogous identifications with present nonhumans, the shamans of SNA are much more interested in seeking to take on the perspective of past humans (ancestors). NOTES I am grateful to Lars Hojer, Martin Holbraad, Steven Hugh-Jones, Caroline Humphrey, Tim Ingold, Tim Morris, and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro for their perceptive comments on a first 424</page><page sequence="15">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN draft of this article. I would also like to thank anonymous Journal reviewers for their insight- ful comments. I thank also Bjoern Bedsted, Regnar Kristensen, and Michael Mahrt for stimulating intellectual company as some of the present ideas were originally formulated in Copenhagen. I also acknowledge the helpful advice of Poul Pedersen. Fieldwork among the Chukchi was carried out in the summer of 1992, and was kindly supported by the University of Aarhus, Denmark. The 1995-6 fieldwork among the Tsaatang was generously supported by Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik's Foundation, The King Christian X Foundation, Mindefonden, and the University of Aarhus. Doctoral research was carried out among the Darxad people for fourteen months between June 1998 and October 1999, and was most generously funded by the Danish Research Academy. 'This metaphor, however, only really works for a snapshot of a given animist cosmology, for such cosmologies are more dynamic than the Swiss cheese metaphor allows. This is because one given object might come to acquire spirit-power just as the spirit-power of another given object might come to an end. The holes in the animist cheese, as it were, constantly change position, as what before was empty becomes filled up and what before was filled up becomes empty. This instability of animist ontologies is captured by Ingold (1998: 184):'life, in the animic ontology, is not an emanation but a generation of being, in a world that is not pre-ordained but incipient, forever on the verge of the actual'. 21 am indebted to Eduardo Viveiros de Castro for this term. 3See, for example,'totemism' in Barnard and Spencer (1996). The term provides a continu- ing source of disagreement, but I think that the way I employ it here represents the most common anthropological understanding. However, in the important, specific context of Abo- riginal studies, the anthropological rendering of the term has changed from an original focus on the interrelationship between social groups and natural species (see e.g. Durkheim 1915; Elkin 1978; Frazer 1910) to a more recent focus on the 'set of linkages between people, land and ancestral beings' (Ingold 1998: 182). The Australian case represents an enigma, compared to North Asia. As we shall see, where the 'horizontal' societies of NNA can be said to be pre- dominantly animist and the 'vertical' societies of SNA can be said to be predominantly totemist, the Aboriginal societies of Australia, confusingly, seem to be largely totemist in their onto- logical principle while at the same time horizontal in their overall social orientation. I see no immediate solution to this enigma, though it may be that a novel reading of, for example, Spencer and Gillen's classical account on the Aboriginal tribes of Central Australia would reveal split ontologies, half-animist and half-totemist in terms of their governing principles (cf. Descola 1996: 96; see Spencer &amp; Gillen 1968: 119-27). Be that as it may, here 'totemism' signifies the existence of particular relationships between human and nonhuman classes. 4I am aware that 'the Amazon' unifies a region where ethnographic diversity is at least as great as in North Asia. I am also aware that some of the distinctions I propose concerning the differences in social ontologies across North Asia are reminiscent of social ontological differ- ences internal to the Amazon region. Hugh-Jones (1994: 35-44), for example, establishes an analytical distinction between 'horizontal shamanism' (HS) and 'vertical shamanism' (VS), where the former epitomizes the more 'classical' shaman - characterized by individualism, low soci- etal status, and moral ambiguity - and the latter represents a more priest-like shaman-type - characterized by hereditary role-ascription, high social status, and unambiguous moral wisdom. Hugh-Jones shows how Amazon societies vary in the prevalence of horizontal and vertical shamanism. Notably, in a few societies, such as the Tukanoa,'HS occurs together with VS' (1994: 33). When I here refer to the Amazon case, I mean primarily the social ontologies character- ized by horizontal shamanism in Hugh-Jones's sense. I do this because, although Viveiros de Castro's thesis about human-nonhuman perspectivism is intended to cover the entire Amazon, on the face of it, it seems especially apt for describing social ontologies of the HS kind. (I base this point solely on the distinction Hugh-Jones 1994: 38 describes between paye or HS type, and -kubu or VS type, shamans among the Tukanoa.) While Hugh-Jones does not directly describe perspectivist notions among the Tukanoa, he does mention what seems to be a crucial difference between the 'final destinations' of the particular metamorphoses of the paye and -kubu shamans. While the most powerful payes 'are able to transform themselves into [jaguars] at will' and thus 'see inside their patients' bodies and recapture their lost souls during curing' (1994: 39), the power of the ~kubus rests mainly on verbal spells and 'though the ~kubu has an impor- tant role in the prevention and cure of illness, his prime function is to effect the transitions ... that ensure the socialization of individuals, the passage of generations, and ordered relations 425</page><page sequence="16">MORTEN A. PEDERSEN between the ancestors and their living descendants' (1994: 43-4). In fact, although the -kubus undergo metamorphoses into animals (1994: 43), what seems to be at stake in the VS mode is the identification between living humans and dead humans (i.e. inter-human perspectivism), as distinct from the relationship between humans and nonhumans (extra-human perspectivism). So, while it would be premature to postulate a totemist modality working alongside an animist one in the Amazon (but see Arhem 1996; Descola 1996: 88), Hugh-Jones's material seems to suggest the possibility of a perspectivist transformation taking place as one's focus moves from the more 'horizontal' to the more 'vertical' societies of the Amazon, a transformation which would be similar to what we have seen to occur between NNA and SNA.

Le totemisme, l'animisme et les ontologies indigenes de 1'Asie du Nord Resume Cet article examine jusqu'a quel point les nouvelles theories sur l'animisme proposees par Descola etViveiros de Castro sont en accord avec les ontologies indigenes de l'Asie du Nord. Apres avoir passe en revue l'ethnographie de l'Asie du Nord et sur la base de travaux sur le terrain en Mongolie et en Siberie, cet article propose qu'une distinction analytique entre les modalites animiste et totemiste peut apporter de la lumiere sur les ontologies indig&amp;nes de l'Asie du Nord. Tandis que les ontologies du Nord de l'Asie du Nord (NNA) sont princi- palement de caractere animiste, les ontologies du Sud de l'Asie du Nord (SNA) sont prin- cipalement totemistes. Cette opposition est congruente avec les distinctions anthropologiques etablies concernant les soci6tes de l'Asie du Nord, telles que la distinction entre les forma- tions sociales organisees 'horizontalement' et 'verticalement'. Pour finir, en adoptant la notion de 'perspectivisme' de Viveiros de Castro, je souleve la question de pourquoi, alors que les notions perspectivistes semblent prosperer au Nord de l'Asie du Nord, elles n'apparaissent pas dans les societes du Sud de l'Asie du Nord.
