This idea does not seem to be carried forth into rabbinic literature. This is part of a wider move away from covenantal thinking, that we find in rabbinic literature. The changes in the theologoumenon concerning the inheritance of the land reflect larger changes within rabbinic thought. They do not concerning the inheritance of the land reflect larger changes within rabbinic thought. They do not constitute an active rejection of the idea, or a move away from the centrality of the land of Israel. Rather, they indicate the different agenda that is typical of rabbinic thinking. The land is related to the fulfillment of the commandments, which become the governing principal of its inheritance. Therefore, it is Israel who inherit the land, rather than the patriarchs. They inherit it by merit, rather than by the favors of a free Divine promise. Related to this change is the interpretation of the covenant with the fathers in terms of merit. The value of the fathers, too, is seen in terms of merit. Since the inheritance of the land relies mostly on the merits of Israel, the merits of the fathers serve another function. They are seen as guarantors of the cosmic order, and are related to the very existance of the world, rather than to the inheritance of the land by Israel. The paper documents the ways in which theological changes affect the hermeneutical process, as well as how through constant exposure to the biblical text,' the original theologumenon can surface, albeit in a limited fashion, within rabbinic literature.</page><page sequence="2">XXXVI Summaries Hannah Kasher MAIMONIDES' INTERPRETATIONS OF THE STORY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK The biblical story of the revelation of God to Moses in the cleft of the rock (Ex. 32:12 — 34:8) is interpreted by Maimonides in his various writings. In his introduction to tractate Avot, he discusses this story as conveying an anthropological-epistemological message that expresses human limitation. In Hilkhot Yesodeiha- Torah a theological argument is added, according to which the story of the cleft of the rock is not to be understood as portraying a corporeal God. In the Guide of the Perplexed the interpretation of the story appears in two contexts. At first its anthropomorphic expressions are explained and then it is discussed in reference to the divine attributes of action, which Moses sought to emulate in his leadership of the people of Israel. The paper analyzes Maimonides' interpretations of this story in each of the given contexts and dwells on the significant differences between them. Eliezer Schweid HERMANN COHEN'S PHILOSOPHICAL PROPHECY Hermann Cohen,s Neo-Kantian philosophy was a prophetical response to the break-down of Humanism all over Europe, and specifically in Germany. Through his philosophical effort to bridge up two main short-comings of Kant's philosophy he tried to save Kant's central Humanistic Ethical Message. In the first volume of his System, Cohen offered a solution to the problem of relation between Scientific causal-inductive logic and Philosophical A-prioristic deductive logic, through the invention of "the Principle of Beginning". In the last volume of his System: "Religion of Reason from the Sources of Judaism", Cohen offered a solution to the problem of relation between the Autonomy of Reason and Prophetical Divine Revelation, through the invention of the idea of "Co-Relation" between God and Man. Even Cohen's methodology in his "Religion of Reason" became prohetic. He started the discussion of Religious consciousness with the idea of Revelation,</page><page sequence="3">Summaries XXXVII elaborating it systematically through its own logic, then he deduced from its pure Practical Logic, the Logic of Ethical Will, the pure ideals of Messianic Realisation. This way Cohen's religious Philosophy has been transformed, into a Systematical mission of Prophetical Philosophy, the Philosophy of Redeeming Ethical Truth. This paper is an analytical interpretation of Cohen's Religious philosophical Methodology, defining him as a real modern Philosophical Prophet. Avi Sagi RELIGIOUS COMMAND VRS. LEGAL SYSTEM — A CHAPTER IN THE THOUGHT OF RABBI SHIMON SHKOP This article analyzes Rabbi Shkop's systemic theory of halakha. According to Shkop, halakha is a normative system composed of two distinct realms: legal and religious. The legal realm of halakha is autonomous in the sense, that its norms do not derive from Divine commandment but rather from rational cognition. Rabbi Shkop holds a type of natural-law theory, which entails that the norms of halakha's legal realm are of universal validity and are equally applicable to Jews and Gentiles. In contrast, the norms of halakha's religious realm are determined by Divine command, and apply to Jews only. Recognition of these two distinct realms forces Shkop to acknowledge the possibility of conflict between them. One result of such a conflict is, that performance of an act which is religiously forbidden may nevertheless generate legally binding consequences. By way of example, let us consider a case in which a man utilizes money gained via usury, in order to betroth a woman. Although usury is prohibited by a norm of halakha's religious realm, this in no way negates the usurer's ownership of money so obtained, as ownership is determined solely by the legal realm of halakha. Thus, the betrothal is halakhically valid, despite the fact that it was effected via usurious gain. Rabbi Shkop recognizes the problematic involved in his contention that a major realm of halakha does not derive its validity from Divine command. However, he points out that this is not essentially anomalous, because the very duty of human beings to obey Divine commands derives, ultimately, from autonomous rational cognition.</page><page sequence="4">XXXVIII Summaries Alexander Even-Chen TWO MESSIANIC TEXTS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT It is customary to think that Jewish Rationalist Thought in the Age of Enlightenment has rejected the Messianic Idea. Two texts composed by Jewish Enlightenment Philosophers shed a new light on Jewish Messianic Thought and suggest that the two may be reconciled. Both texts present a synthesis between Rationalism, Messianism and Nationalist sentiment.</page><page sequence="5">Summaries XXXIX Lawrence Kaplan JEWISH ORTHODOXY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BETWEEN TWO WORLDS Hillel Goldberg's monograph, Between Berlin and Slobodka, is, as its subtitle indicates, devoted to a study of six "Jewish transition figures from Eastern Europe" who made the difficult and wrenching move to the west: Rabbis Israel Salanter, Yitzhak Hutner, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and Joseph Zev Lipovitz, Rabbi Prof. Abraham Joshua Heschel, and Prof. Harry Wolfson. These major scholars and thinkers tried to bridge the gap — at times the abyss — between the world of rabbinic tradition and learning in which they were raised and which they had all so thoroughly mastered, and the highly skeptical and at times deeply anti-traditional world of Western culture which they encountered and which most of them similarly mastered. Goldberg claims to judge these individuals not so much on the cogency of their ideas, the depth and breadth of their learning, and the originality of their teachings, but on their success or lack thereof in somehow integrating the two clashing worlds within their very being, in arriving at a genuine synthesis expressed in their very lives. A careful and extended examination of Goldberg's judgements reveals, however, that his evaluations cannot be sustained and that what he is really offering us is a purely theological judgement in a scholarly garb. That is, Goldberg, who seeks to write his book both as a committed Orthodox Jew and an objective scholarly observer, allows the former stance to override the latter, and, in truth, judges his subjects in terms of their nearness to or distance from strict Orthodoxy. Moreover, the alternative analysis of the thought of these figures suggested in this review-essay, while necessarily sketchy and incomplete, leads to the tentative conclusion that they, to use Goldberg's ostensible criterion, were, despite tensions and contradictions, considerably more successful in integrating the worlds of traditional Judaism and Western culture than Goldberg would have us think.</page></plain_text>
