Ezekiel 34:18 man has lost His desolating privilege, and stands An equal amidst equals; happiness And science dawn though late upon the earth. EP. B. Shelley "The Daemon of the World," lines 438-441 ECAUSE twenty-five years ago I helped to light a fuse leading to this decade's explosion of ecological criticism of Romantic writers (even tossing a squib into the fireworks in 1994), I'm specially interested in the green fallout on our scholarship. Two recent collections in leading Romantic journals, Studies in Romanti- cism, 35.3 (Fall 1996), and The Wordsworth Circle, 28.3 (Fall 1997), offer evidence of why, for good or ill, ecology flourishes as a critical mode.' A fifty-year trend of scholarly undervaluation of the Romantics' phys- ical, intellectual, and ideological engagements with natural phenom- ena has been dramatically reversed. Ecological critics are recovering the dense ambiguities of authentic historical understanding buried in historicism. They enable us to appreciate the unusual fluidity with which diverse cultural activities interpenetrated in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries-perhaps the distinctive feature of that epoch. The distinguishing heterogeneity of what we call the Roman- I. These two collections are hereafter cited in the text as SIR and TWC. [</page><page sequence="2">58 Keats-Shelley Journal tic era requires criticisms that reject oversimplification, especially of its dynamic interdependencies. Ecological vitality, however, also provokes confusion, as appears in the Studies in Romanticism collection, in which several essays wonder about what ecological criticism is doing to Romantic studies. Ralph Pite opens the SIR issue by complaining of the difficulty in seeing "what distinguishes a green way of reading from all others" (SIR, 359). He suggests a source for his discomfort by presenting a reading of Wordsworth's "Nutting" as if no previous critic had ever commented on the poem. Pite nonetheless concludes by citing Aldo Leopold on "land ethic" as somehow relevant to Wordsworth's accomplishment, a citation inconceivable not many years ago, soon perhaps to be in- evitable. Pite's methodological bias resurfaces in Greg Garrard's more inter- esting essay "Radical Pastoral?" that he says (SIR, 464, n42) ought to be titled merely "Radical?" One may be puzzled by what his title does refer to, because most ecological critics are hostile to "pastoral." But Garrard's purposes are more polemical than historical, this writer being one of his targets. Criticism is disagreement, and Garrard raises some issues it might be useful to argue out, for example, the relevance of Spinozism to what he and I both call Romantic proto-ecological views. But fruitful argument depends upon accurate knowledge of previous work on the topic at issue (how we reached this point of dis- agreement), as well as of the position one disagrees with. Garrard accuses me (SIR, 45I), however, of being too cordial toward psycho- analytical readings of "Nutting." This is surprising, not alone because I was once accused publicly of being the only anti-Freudian in New York City, but also because the four pages (pp. 62-66) Garrard cites from my Ecological Literacy Criticism in fact urge superseding the "purely psychosocial interpretations that have dominated our criticism for two generations" with increased attention to the "literal circum- stances" of the boy "in the hazel grove," since to me Wordsworth's "sense of responsibility to nature" seems his ground for claiming to be a socially responsible poet.2 Garrard's misrepresentation repeats a characteristic defect of critics 2.

Ecological criticism, as is demonstrated by a majority of the essays in these two collections, takes account of the history of commentary that determines the form in which we encounter a literary text. Because it concentrates on shifting diversi- ties of fact and perspective, ecological criticism tends to focus on nuanced differentiations of its readings from those of its predecessors. Association with scientific disciplines seems also to revitalize tradi- tional standards of scholarly precision. Two other articles in the SIR issue display difficulties created by over-enthusiasm of apostles for a new dispensation. Jonathan Bate (editor of this collection) is recognized as a major popularizer of green Romantic criticism. In his critique of Keats's "To Autumn" he asserts that "Keats had an intuitive understanding of the underlying law of community ecology, namely that biodiversity is the key to the survival and adaptation of ecosystems" (SIR, I42). Even loyal envi- ronmentalists may wonder of what exactly such an intuition would consist. But four pages later Bate tests credulity further: "as Keats had an intuitive knowledge of the importance of illusory excess as a principle of community ecology, so Coleridge had an intuitive knowledge of the fractal structure of time and weather." To me, that's green garbage. Unnecessary, too. For Bate is making the valuable point that it is characteristic of Romantics to write poems built on careful observations of very specific weather phenomenena, thereby exemplifying what Garrard cites as a virtue of ecological critics, read- ing with the grain. James McKusick, in "Coleridge and the Economy of Nature," avoids intuitions, but through some slippery uses of "organic" and "holistic" exaggerates Coleridge's cordiality to the Enlightenment fondness for cycles. Major advances in Romantic thinking came through countering cyclical conceptions with articulation of open- ended processes--evolution being the spectacular example. But McKusick redeems himself with his description of Coleridge's "appreciation for the vital and evolving nature of language within a local environment" (SIR, 383). McKusick catalogs Coleridge's lexical innovations deriving from "his understanding of linguistic form as</page><page sequence="4">160 Keats-Shelley Journal the result of an ongoing conversation between the land and those who dwell upon it" (SIR, 383). Coleridge created an ecolect reflective of "local environmental conditions" and expressive of "his own dis- tinctive way of perceiving and responding to the natural world" (SIR, 384). McKusick also suggests that language innovation makes the 1798 version of "The Ancient Mariner" worthy of serious restudy. He emphasizes the early version's "ecotones"--a term picked up from the contemporary environmentalist Roman Coles: ecotones-with their intermingling borders-are especially fertile "spe- cial meeting grounds" charged with "evolutionary potential." . . . Yet the most profound ecotone... is the one that occurs on the dialogical edge between the self and the otherness of the world ... (SIR, 388) McKusick here focuses a major contribution offered by ecology to critical analyses: means to evaluate how writers manipulate interfaces between language and sensory experience of the physical environ- ment. The character of every piece of"nature writing" is determined by the shifting junctures between linguistic "reporting" and the phys- ical phenomena reported. At those edges of encounter one gains insight into the significance of how subjectivity and cultural tradition are interacting in representation of sensory experiences. A lot of such insight is provided by The Wordsworth Circle collec- tion, edited by McKusick. These specific acts of ecological criticism are notable for the detailed nature of both their textual analyses and their descriptions of historical contexts. Kevin Hutchings' study of Blake's Thel, for one instance, does full justice to his many predeces- sors, demonstrating, for example, how an ecological reading may productively reformulate even de Manian insights. Interpreting Har as "harmony" in the eighteenth-century sense of what Locke called "a great interlocking order," Hutchings shows that for Blake such Lockean harmony is a sinister disguise for its opposite. For Blake, a non-instrumental relation of humanity to nature can be dramatically articulated only through "a self-reflexive understanding of the envi- ronmental intrusiveness of language itself" (TWC, I73). Like McKusick, then, Hutchings uses an ecological approach to unfold in all its complicated uncertainty a pattern of shifting interre-</page><page sequence="5">Bards and Critics 161 lations between discursive practice and phenomenal facts. Because such interrelations characterize many of the most powerful and enduring Romantic poems, this method is appropriate to exploring the peculiar energy of Romantic imagining. In contrast to predictive and positive knowledge, ecological knowledge is unstable and indeterminate, based on the changing relationships, at any given moment, between entities which live not alone, nor for themselves. (TWC, 175) Ecological illumination results from a confluence of scientific research and hypothesizing founded on knowledge of previous stud- ies of and speculations about physical phenomena. Literary criticism that attempts more than cheerleading for feel-good environmental- ism, therefore, needs to be decently informed about contemporary scientific practices and assisted by a grasp of the historic development of these practices. The TWC essays show serious students of Ro- manticism leaving behind superficial references to relativity, the uncertainty principle, and chaos theory. Instead, they describe in detail how and why earlier scientific thinking and investigation took the forms it did, and thereby they make possible defining exactly their exchanges with literary discourse. These descriptions also refine our awareness of how current scientific discoveries and hypotheses affect our own perceptions. As Ashton Nichols observes in his discussion of "The Anxiety of Species: Toward a Romantic Natural History": Biology may not appear to determine destiny in the nineteenth century -as it so often does at our own cultural moment-but a Romantic nat- ural history helps to show how the "Nature" of Newton and Linnaeus becomes the "nature" of Stephen Hawking and Stephen Jay Gould. (TWC, 135) Knowledge of natural history helps Timothy Morton in his rang- ing SIR essay to reveal connections between "Shelley's Green Desert" and ideas of such moderns as Adorno, Benjamin, and Derrida, demonstrating how Shelley's conception of the natural world enabled him to become "an exemplar of intertextual, transferential discursive processes that can never be reduced to a fundamental element" (SIR, 429). Morton, proposing "ecography" as a term for this kind of crit-</page><page sequence="6">162 Keats-Shelley Journal icism, urges that ecography should become increasingly "reflexive, developing appropriate technologies of reading," which technologies will enable us to "use words like 'appreciate' alongside words like 'cri- tique.'" Morton here identifies the motivating force of the best essays in these two collections, a desire to register "both the problems and the pleasures of ecological discourse" (SIR, 427). Exemplary of these impulses is Tim Fulford's tracing out of Coleridge's involvement in the history of natural history. Against the conservatismJonathan Bate implies in his generalized advocacy of the Lake poets as opponents of environmental degradation, Fulford (making good use of work by Levere, Wylie, Alan Bewell, and Ann Shtier), shows Coleridge founding his radical politics on an under- standing of nature that put him in opposition to Erasmus Darwin, the chief popularizer of Linnaean botany in the 1790s. Fulford is alive to the multiple complexities of this antagonism. One of the poet's objections to Darwin's classifying system was that it disguised a mech- anistic debasement of religion. Also relevant was a matter of sexual poetics. Linnaeus' systemizing, of course, depended on sexual differ- entiations; his terminology explicitly drew parallels between plant and human sexual features. Even so, by the 1790os botany had become a fashionable study for women. Fulford argues that, in resisting Darwin, Coleridge came "to portray the act of reading as the com- pletion by an implicitly female mind of a text which the male author could not resolve by himself" (TWC, 125). Today, I suppose, one must wonder how a male would read a female author's text. But by artic- ulating the intricate struggles over the understanding of botany and its gendered social functioning in the Romantic era, Fulford escapes from restrictive binary thinking. He thus permits us to recognize sur- prising intricacies of 1790os sexual poetics. This suggests that ecological thinking applied to Romantic femi- nist and gender studies holds out promise of critical enrichment. Even skeptics recognize that ecological approaches are broadening the Romantic canon in more than one dimension. Yet when we include women poets and novelists (or nature writers of both sexes) in the Romantic canon, we achieve little unless we simultaneously utilize the new material to improve comprehension of precisely what historical forces produced both earlier exclusions and current inclu-</page><page sequence="7">Bards and Critics 163 sions. Fulford's observations, for instance, draw attention to the fact that Romantic women, because of various social restrictions (above all educational), were usually less able than men to take advantage of advances in scientific knowledge. I have begun to compile evidence of this through a comparative study of Romantic "nature poetry" written by men and women, a subfield so far unexplored in any sys- tematic fashion. There are, to give a quick example, two substantial Romantic poems dealing with the survivors of the Bounty mutiny on a Pacific island, Christina, The Maid of the South Seas, by Mary Mitford (with a little help from Coleridge), and Byron's The Island. The nature of the subject, with all its political and social resonances, makes for dramatic contrasts, especially in the two works' representations of a natural environment both poets knew only through engravings and second-hand accounts. Contrasting their narrative imaginings of such an "exotic" environment allows vivid differentiations of the effects of gender, political bias, social position, and education in the deploy- ment of linguistic conventions for evoking sensory experiences. Evidence that ecological approaches are already enriching other modes of criticism is provided by Onno Oerlemans' "Romanticism and the Metaphysics of Species" in TWC issue. Oerlemans fully controls the scientific history needed to explore through concrete examples subtle implications in Foucault's conjectures on epistemic changes. Oerlmans demonstrates how analysis of discourse focused on the "species concept" may calibrate precisely the Romantics' struggle with the problems that language is both an aid and an imped- iment to perception of natural phenomena. Putting into practice the Foucauldian idea that language hides its own reality, Oerlmans traces the Romantics' indebtedness to the eighteenth-century system of intellectual classifying that "imposes structure onto nature, and yet also reveals structure we might not otherwise see" (TWC, I39). This system the Romantics were determined to revise. Oerlemans here identifies an important reason why Romantic poets so often "hypoth- esized" within" if-then" rhetorical structures. He also develops some keen insights into the linguistic practices of Gilbert White and John Clare-using them finally as a contrast for an original and illuminat- ing reading of Shelley's "Mont Blanc." I want here, however, to emphasize his observations that White's</page><page sequence="8">164 Keats-Shelley Journal and Clare's focus on animal behavior was bound into their use of anthropomorphic language. Oerlemans credits this language with giving the observers' empirical interest in specific behavior a para- doxical double effect. It offers readers a sense of the proximity of human lives to animal lives, and at the same time dramatizes the sense of the "otherness, the final difference of each animal" as an individual (TWC, I43). Anthropomorphism (a major focus of current ecologi- cal thinking) is, indeed, the paradoxical center of Romantic writing, if not quite in the way Ruskin thought. Oerlemans correctly observes that Romantic "anthropomorphizing" does not necessarily involve projection of human qualities. It may urge the recognizing of shared attributes between distinct creatures. Such "lateral" or "affiliative" anthropomorphizing demanded extraordinary efforts of reflexive self-consciousness, because the Romantics wrote within traditions both spiritual and scientific that assumed hierarchical differences between human and animal life. This is one kind of language-use which displays the proto-ecological understanding of the Romantics in a fashion that simultaneously dramatizes our difficulties in finding a non-distortive critical vocablulary to describe their innovative accom- plishments. Oerlemans observes that Clare's idiosyncratic diction, grammar, and spelling force upon his readers "a sense that the reality described has been specifically perceived by a single observer, and that his obser- vation is not repeatable" (TWC, I43). The comment reveals why ecologically oriented critics are foremost in establishing Clare within the Romantic canon, are, in fact, opening the way to recognition of unique values in a range of undervalued poets, as well as elucidating heretofore unrecognized qualities in canonical works. Their analyses offer escape from imprisonment within the unexamined presupposi- tions which too often confine our critical thinking, because an eco- logical approach demands continuous reassessment of the adequacy of its descriptions of very different discursive systems for representing unique sensory experiences of natural phenomena. Perception of "Romanticism" as a set of mental and physical prac- tices intersecting with a set of self-transforming discourses is aided by W. John Coletta in another fashion through his analyses in "'Writing Larks': John Clare's Semiosis of Nature." Coletta argues that Clare</page><page sequence="9">Bards and Critics I65 illustrates the value for literary criticism of"landscape ecology," which concerns primarily "'edges' . . . 'patches' and 'spatial heterogeneity'" (rather than homogeneity) and "the dramatization of ecological dis- continuities" (TWC, 199). A critique thus focusing on peculiar rela- tions of linguistic representation to physical experience is inherently dynamic. It is also inherently resistive to dogmatic theorizing, because it depends on alertness to the continuous shifting of the critic's rela- tion to diverse "irregularities" in his text. Coletta's work, above all else, demonstrates that ecological criticism compels us to confront what decisively distinguishes us intellectually from the Romantics of two centuries ago: the effects (for good and ill) of mind-boggling advances of scientific research. Ecological criticism, like other critical modes, assesses literary rep- resentations according to current conceptions of the nature of reality. The special contribution of an ecological approach is its salience to today's understandings of what is "real," and therefore to today's "horizon of expectations." At this historical moment the influence of ecological ideas seems to surpass political or religious ones in defining our sense of the realities we must experience. That sense was shaped differently, for example, in the earlier seventeenth century. Or, for a contrast closer to home, contemporary psychoanalytic criticism man- ifests the impact of ecological concerns to which earlier psychoana- lytic critics were indifferent. The scientific "revolution" centering on the theory of evolution during the past fifty years has spawned socio- technological consequences impacting on the condition of virtually every living organism on the planet, including human beings and their cultures. This event-surely one of the most astounding achievements of human consciousness, and just as certainly terrifying in its potentially destructive effects-has transformed our ideas of what is real, what actually happens in our world, and what we can imagine as really happening. Within this horizon all critics must, unconsciously or consciously (and better if the latter), analyze and evaluate their texts in terms something like Leopold's "land ethic." We cannot today intelligently discuss psychology, social relations, ethics or economics-any cultural activity-without awareness that every human community partici- pates in encompassing biological communities. Consciousness of this</page><page sequence="10">166 Keats-Shelley Journal ecosystemic context opens new ways of studying literature. I offered a small example at the Wordsworth conference at Grasmere in the summer of 1997 by describing how "ecological visual perception" has changed our knowledge of the way humans actually perceive their environment.3 Research deriving from studies by J. J. Gibson, for instance, requires that we revise "point of view" explanations of how we see, because in fact human seeing always occurs along a "path of observations."4 Such a path (among other things) better accounts for the temporal dimension in visual perception. The implications for literary analysis of replacing "point of view" with "path of observa- tions" criticism are immediately apparent, and other of Gibson's dis- coveries are as important. "Affordances," for example, have recently been proposed as the basis of a new metatheory for film criticism. What today we call the Romantic era is especially interesting because in it are discernible beginnings of ideas developed by mod- ern scientists such as Gibson. Proto-ecological thinking, in fact, uniquely distinguishes the late eighteenth and early nineteenth cen- turies in Europe. It was then that the simultaneous flowering of what were to be called the life sciences (notably chemistry, physiology, biology) joined with geology to become inextricably engaged with evolutionary ideas. This interplay initiated what became true ecology, deriving from Darwin's full articulation of evolutionary theory and Mendel's subsequent outlining of genetic processes. The peculiar historical position of the Romantic epoch, of course, in no way diminishes the value of analyses of our horizon's relations to other eras. The latter half of the nineteenth century, the decades immediately following publication of The Origin of Species, for instance, overflow with illuminating and complex ecological issues. Epochs preceding the Romantic, however, from the eighteenth cen- tury back into darkest antiquity, belong-I believe-to a distinctively pre-ecological realm. In my view, authentically ecological attitudes are not possible until modern research sciences have reached a sophis- ticated state of development and are informed by at least a nascent sci- entific concept of evolution. This regards all life forms in themselves 3. Karl Kroeber, "The Presence of Absences: Were the Other Two Wedding Guests William Wordsworth and Fletcher Christian?," TWC 29.1 (Winter 1998), 3-9. 4. J.

These natural processes, therefore, continually embody the effects of chance. This conception has enabled the various sciences through their interactions to create what is not in itself a science: ecological understanding of organisms and ecosystems functioning with an "open," indeterminate coherence. Ecology is a creation of nineteenth-century European science. It is a cultural event. Its most momentous result may be the systematic explanation of how all human cultures originate in and ultimately depend upon earth's natural environment. Some, however, believe that it is better to understand "ecology" as attitudes toward the nat- ural environment that are ancient and articulated in diverse ways by many different peoples before the Romantic era. A few scholars, such as Donald Worster and Clarence Glacken,s hold this position on the basis of careful historical research, and with them I respectfully dis- agree. The majority taking this view, however, tend to rely on wilful ignorance or distortion of facts, often indulging in the rankest senti- mentality. I speak harshly of these well-meaning enthusiasts, because their good intentions could land us in the hell of a lethal instead of a beneficent environment. It is our responsibility to recognize the true historical processes by which we have become engaged in profoundly revaluing culture's relation to nature, and on that basis realistically to assess how to sustain and foster the interdependencies of the diverse communities which constitute the life of our planet. Threatening environmental crises are, at root, about what it means to be human in a godless cosmos. This is why responsible humanists could contribute to the resolution of problems produced by scientific technology. Current pressures of population (to cite a single example) leading to nutritional shortages and ravagings of earth's physical resources originated in scientific-medical discoveries. Science even fuels danger-fraught economic systems that undermine traditional socio-political control of scientific development itself. Because sci- ences depend upon some free flow of information, democratic soci- 5.

But transnational businesses and cartels paying heed to nothing but quick profit for a few are superseding political governments in controlling uses to which scientific technology is put. Democratic institutions, including universities, seem every day less able, and less willing, to assert the need for scientific responsibility. In these circumstances, it is dangerous to preach mindless nostalgia for a fictive pre-scientific past, or to shirk the intellectual labor of resolving the paradox that the most remarkable accomplishments of human intelligence now threaten to exterminate all civilization. I have recently been studying American Indian traditions, and in Artistry in Native American Myths (Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1998) I discuss at length unfamiliar Native American attitudes toward the natural world. We misunderstand these attitudes unless we recognize their difference from Judeo-Christian traditions when it comes to defining humankind's relation to nature. But Native American views are not precursors of contemporary scientific under- standing of ecological processes. American Indians, like ancient Greeks, Hebrew prophets, Romans, Arabs, Hindus, or Renaissance Florentines, included many intelligent people, all of whom lacked the foundation of systematized research science based on evolutionary conceptions that could have enabled them to arrive at authentic eco- logical ideas. No civilization before our own had any possibility of attaining the wondrously complex and exact interaction of diverse intellectual disciplines which make up scientific ecology. This new appreciation of the interdependencies constituting the natural uni- verse, however, derives from discoveries largely responsible for tech- nological developments that endanger the interlocking systems which support life on our planet. Insight into the emergence of this paradox is offered by the debates on the relation of nature to culture which climaxed in the eighteenth century. When (to overschematize for the sake of clarity) Rousseau postulates a "state of nature," he attempts to explain the paradox that if there is no divine source for culture, it must be a natural phenom-</page><page sequence="13">Bards and Critics 169 enon-even though scientific discoveries seem to show human cul- ture as different from all other features of the natural environment. This is why for Rousseau, Herder, and others in the mid-eighteenth century the question of the origin of language became so important. It is language, especially written language, that appears most vividly to distinguish human culture from the rest of nature. The open- ended and open-branching concept of evolution (to continue this fast-forward schematizing) was a solution to the apparent contradic- tion that human culture, originating "naturally" through its very capacity to conceive of "nature" as distinct from culture appeared to free itself from subjection to merely natural processes. The idea of evolution contains within itself the possibility of its own unpre- dictable development. It is not surprising, then, that writing about natural phenomena during the past two centuries has produced both scientific and liter- ary works singular for the depth of their insights into the relations of human behavior to events of physical nature. Critics of such writing are advantaged in defining ways in which problems of expression intersect with perceptions of how human beings do and may relate to their environments. Such definitions promise deepened understand- ing of functions unique to humankind's self-reflective powers. Pro- bing into the natural role of self-consciousness should lead to better evaluations of what might be our species' peculiar contribution to maintaining ecosystemic health in an evolving natural cosmos. We have an opportunity to prove the truth of Paul Valery's Romantically anti-Cartesian epigram: "'Man thinks, therefore I am,' says the uni- verse. Against the once popular modernist view that poetry makes noth- ing happen and poems should not mean but be, ecologically oriented critics propose that poems may "mean" a great deal. They can influence how people think and behave, because good poems affect how we think about how we think (and feel), thereby intensifying as well as complicating productive self-reflexivity, thus opening insights into different possibilities of thought and behavior. Criticism's value in increasing the practical efficacy of critical thinking can only be enhanced when infused with knowledge of the discoveries and</page><page sequence="14">170 Keats-Shelley Journal directing hypotheses of contemporary sciences. Essays I've discussed proffer evidence of this enhancement, but beyond these I want to call attention to the work of Gillian Beer, a scholar too seldom included among the ecologically minded. Besides allowing me to revisit the relation of language and biology, her dominant interest in post- Darwinian literature suggests an appropriately indeterminate closing perspective on Romantic ecological criticism. I leave aside her fine work on Darwin and fiction, along with her "Wave theory and the Rise of Literary Modernism," a model of scholarly exegesis of the interrelating of scientific and literary discourse. I only commend to Romanticists her essay "Darwin and the Growth of Language Theory."6 Beer, long interested in the interplaying between scientific and lit- erary writing, in this article demonstrates how analyses of discourse can reveal the activity in an author's mind of conceptions seemingly not relevant to his subject. Beer even shows that what such activity elides may help to orient thinking of someone in a different field. It is perhaps not surprising that she cites William Jones' suggestion in 1786 that the Greek and Latin languages "sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists," as relevant to Darwin's con- ception of the irrecoverable forms of "the one parent." More impor- tant, however, is her citation of Dugald Stewart's proposal that circumstances in the history of language, attach different meanings to the same words; and which often, by slow and insensible gradations, remove them to such distance from their primitive or radical sense, that no ingenuity can trace the successive steps of their progress. (lo7) Beer places this suggestion of non-deliberate processes of change alongside Darwin's emphasis upon the modifications which "'surely but slowly follow from the unconscious process' of natural selection" (i07). She then highlights Stewart's refusal to accept any static taxon- omy, his rejection of an essentialist view of language categorization anticipating what Darwin was to call "the vain search for the .. undiscoverable essence of the term Species" (i07). She observes, 6. Gillian Beer, "Darwin and the Growth of Language Theory," in Open Fields: Science in Cultural Encounter (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), 95-114.</page><page sequence="15">Bards and Critics 171 finally, that in standing against essentialism Stewart's language theory served as a useful precondition of evolutionary thinking, even though Stewart makes no effort to track linguistic evolution, because he believes the phases by which words change "no ingenuity can trace." Thus, Beer argues, the specifically biological investigation "was left over to be undertaken later in a different field" (O107). Her demon- stration of how "the branching diagram of Darwinian theory shares lots of patterns with that of the comparative grammarians of the ear- lier nineteenth century" (107-108) persuades both through its ana- lytic specificity and its sensitivity to the nuances of historical processes of omission as well as of positive influence. She thus exemplifies rewards to be found in historical criticism founded on concrete knowledge of evolutionary ideas, with perhaps the biggest prize being clearer definition of the subtle fashions by which imaginative uses of language not merely reflect but also initiate cultural trans- formations. Even as Beer wrote, Darwinian concepts were being dramatically refashioned, not least by revisions in the view of speciation's role in evolutionary processes. The orientation of these revisions is toward uncertainty, contingency, indeterminacy, as is perhaps most con- cretely illustrated by the expanding acceptance of Eldredge and Gould's hypothesis of punctuated equilibrium. Ecological apprecia- tion of the powerful yet fragile systems of interdependency under- girding all forms of biological activity (including culture) is now complicated by growing awareness of how arbitrary may be the beginnings of successful species, and how swiftly, for a sensational example, one rogue asteroid may annihilate species that have success- fully adapted for untold millennia. These changes do not merely make relevant again Romantic Cuvier's catastrophism. They derive from and encourage more careful assessments of humankind's self- reflexive consciousness, which attains its greatest power in imagina- tive works of both literature and science. Ecologically oriented critical thinking now offers the best means for evaluating how-and why-our culture conceives the operation of natural processes as we do, especially the degree to which our conceptions accurately repre- sent actual phenomena or merely project mental prejudices socially induced. On the basis of such evaluations depends our judgment,</page><page sequence="16">172 Keats-Shelley Journal surely the primary task of any who define themselves as humanists, of how at this historical moment we may best use our wonderfully unique, and uniquely dangerous, gift of linguistically empowered self-consciousness.
