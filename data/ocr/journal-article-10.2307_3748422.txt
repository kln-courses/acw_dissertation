<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MEANING OF BEAUTY A. H. B. ALLEN THEORIES of beauty are often divided into the objective and the subjective. I am doubtful whether a rigid distinction between the two can be maintained. It is difficult for an objective theory to assert that the impression of beauty is received quite passively, without any reaction or co-operation on the part of the subject, which is likely to be similar in the various cases. On the other hand it is equally difficult to deny that there is a strong presumption that, when reactions of a similar kind occur, whether called pleasure or what not, there is likely to be discovered some general similarity in the objects eliciting the reaction. Every theory must, in that case, admit that in the experience of beauty there must exist a relation between a subject and an object, and thus the difference between theories must be held to depend on whether emphasis is laid more on the subjective or on the objective side. The object of this paper is to ask whether, in the instances where the term beautiful is used, there is to be discovered a common element, either on the side of the subject or the object. The method proposed to be used is entirely empirical. That is to say, I want to cite instances of what in common usage is called beauty, in order to see whether any common element, or common elements, are to be found. We cannot of course confine ourselves to what is explicit and fully conscious in the mind. It is necessary to try to draw out what is latent and implied. What is not going to be attempted is to deal with the question whether there is in the nature of reality any standard or principle determining that some judge- ments of beauty are valid and true and that others are not, whether there can be any ultimate "rightness" or "wrongness" about them. It might be said that in that case our enquiry is rather psychology than philosophy. There is no need to quarrel over words. At least it can be claimed that such an enquiry is an indispensable preliminary to philosophy. It is always useful to give the reader some sort of a warning so as to prepare him for the general lines of the theory being advocated. The view to be advocated then is that in all cases of beauty the subject finds in the object an expression of some sort of feeling or emotion, in which he can participate. It may be called an expres- sionist theory. The theory to be rejected, mainly by implication, is that beauty is a quality of the forms of objects, grasped by the subject in a way generally similar to that in which other qualities of objects are apprehended. I2</page><page sequence="2">THE MEANING OF BEAUTY Undoubtedly it is not uncommon to hear the word beautiful used in a very wide fashion, merely as expressing very high commenda- tion. People say that they have enjoyed a beautiful meal, or had a beautiful (or perhaps lovely) holiday. In a sense this might be called common usage. But I don't think it need be taken very seriously. Most people would, I think, admit on reflection that it involves a certain hyperbolical stretching of language. They seem to feel intuitively, if somewhat vaguely, that there is a class of experiences in which there is a general similarity, those, for instance, which may occur in seeing a woman's face, a rose or a sunset, in contemplating a picture or a cathedral, and in hearing a symphony or a poem. Philo- sophers have given these experiences the general name of "aesthetic." To the ordinary man this would probably savour somewhat of pedantry, and there is not much point in introducing another tech- nical term which itself requires definition. Nevertheless it can be said to have a certain usefulness as indicating that there is a whole class of experiences marked off from the general field of value by a similarity among themselves, even if we can't at present describe that similarity more definitely. A certain preliminary clue to the definition of the aesthetic field can be given by the fact that beauty is generally held to be the opposite of ugliness. The two are regarded as complementary to, and implying, each other. The aesthetic field must include both facts, just as the field of value includes both goodness and badness. Ugliness has of course a much more restricted meaning than the opposite of that high degree of general excellence to which the term 'beautiful' is sometimes applied. We must bear in mind then that we have to define both beauty and ugliness in their ordinary usage. But we can hardly make further progress towards the further defini- tions required, unless we pass to concrete examples and consider what common qualities may be found in them. Our examples, it should be hardly necessary to say, must be taken from the realms both of nature and of art. There have been writers who have main- tained that the aesthetic field is the field of art only. It would be difficult to imagine anything in more flagrant contradiction with common usage than to say that the terms beauty and ugliness can- not be properly applied to natural objects. If then we are to consider both nature and art, it seems obvious to begin with nature. Nature is prior to art, men must have felt the first stirrings of aesthetic feeling in face of the objects of nature, before they sat down to fashion things, which induce similar stirrings in others. There is no more common use of the words beautiful and ugly than in respect of human forms and faces. These are almost the first things that occur to us when we hear the words in question. Can we analyse this application of the word beautiful? There are cases in B II3</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY which we call the human body beautiful merely qua animal organism. In such cases there must always be found symmetry, otherwise the figure would give a disagreeable impression of lop-sidedness. But also, when the body appears as fully developed, with all the signs of perfect health, there is given the impression that with this there must go a valuable consciousness of bodily life, a feeling, that is to say, of vitality and vigour. Such a sight infects us with a glow of sympathy, and we contrast it with the deviations from the normal which seem to us the signs of ill-health and a less valuable psychical life. Over and above a purely animal vitality the lines of the body are capable of showing psychic characters. A delicate and rounded form is interpreted as an index of the mind within, and so also is a form that is rugged and massive. But the lines of the body are carried on into the face, and it is above all in the face that we look for the expression of a character and indwelling spirit. Emotions are no doubt sometimes expressed in a purely transitory form. They may pass away and leave the general character of the face unaltered. But we can in tact hardly make a rigid distinction between the permanent and the transitory. The habitually felt emotions write themselves in the features in forms which we interpret as a liability to that parti- cular kind of emotion. Over and above the foundation of symmetry and physical health, there are three permanent or semi-permanent characters which most people would, I think, agree should be shown in a beautiful face. The first of these, and probably that which is fundamental, is happiness, or serenity, the character of a mind at peace with itself and successful in its activities. If a main interest is thwarted, or if two interests thwart each other and remain unsatisfied, there will be tension and discord, and the mind will be tormented with unsatisfied longing. Happiness is the opposite of this, the feeling of a balanced harmony in the mental life, though of course it is not impossible that it may be attained through the overcoming of disappointment and suffering. Happiness and unhappiness can express themselves in the permanent lines of the face. Tension and discord tend to show themselves in hard lines and frowns which are felt to be incom- patible with beauty. The smile on the other hand is a relaxation of the facial muscles and is the primary sign of a release from mental tension. While we do not ask that a beautiful face should always be actually smiling, yet we do ask that it should be free from hard tension, and should appear as serene and content, capable of further relaxation into the smile itself. With this there is required also a certain character of colour. With all races, in spite of differences of climate and habits, there is an association of light with cheerfulness and of darkness with depression. No doubt, as a rule, custom makes "I4</page><page sequence="4">THE MEANING OF BEAUTY men prefer their own racial types. But in all cases, I think, they would like to see a brightness, in the eyes at least, which would be inter- preted as a sign of vitality and joy, rather than a dullness which would seem to be a sign of both bodily and mental depression. "Radiant" is an epithet which we especially attach to beauty. The second character required to be expressed is that of tender- ness or love. No doubt it would be possible to say that the social instinct is one of the main instincts native to the human mind, and that, if it is defective or truncated, there could not in that particular case exist a fully developed harmonious character. This is true. But in addition to this there is a more direct and positive connection between love and the happiness that springs from a mental life at harmony with itself. A mind in violent opposition to its environment could not itself have the character of harmonious repose. It might have the values of force and intensity, but not that of restfulness. The mind of man tends of its own nature to act positively outwards in relation to other minds. If in harmony with itself, it will naturally tend to radiate its own harmony outwards in its relation to other minds. Otherwise it could not maintain its own internal feeling of harmony and peace. Either that feeling would become deadened by remaining shut up in itself, or else, if active tendencies towards others remained and were suppressed, there would be created a feeling of internal discord. For a world of conscious selves the rela- tion of harmony showing itself in positive form is the relation of love. It is possible to venture on a somewhat closer description of how this feeling can express itself in a face. It has been universally felt that, quite apart from extraneous associations, the feeling of love has a natural and inner affinity to gradual change or movement and that hard or hostile feelings have a similar affinity with abrupt change. The reason must be that the abrupt movement or change is bound to give a shock or disturbance to the environment, which the quiet and gradual movement avoids. Our ordinary use of words is evidence for this. We speak naturally of "gentle" curves, of colours melting "gently" into each other, and on the other hand, of abrupt change or transition as "violent" or "harsh." The words "violent" and "gentle" and others like them are used indiscriminately both of the physical and the mental. Always what we value and want to preserve must be handled gently. In the human face, as already remarked, the smile is a relaxation of the muscles. Directed towards another person it is held to be a natural sign of release from tension and a kindly temper of mind. On the other hand, the hard straight lines of the frown indicate tension of mind and hostility towards another. In the same sort of way we interpret the lights and colours in the eyes as meaning a melting tenderness, and we contrast this with the fixed glare of hatred and the abrupt flashes of anger. Both II5</page><page sequence="5">P H I L O S O P H Y poets and philosophers have written in this sense. Burke says: "So that to form a finished human beauty and to give it its full influence, the face must be expressive of such gentle amiable qualities as correspond with the softness smoothness and delicacy of the out- ward form."' And Shakespeare seems to think that, normally at least, the beautiful face should express a real inner tenderness. For there can live no hatred in thine eye, Therefore in that I cannot know thy change. In many's looks, the false heart's history Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell; Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be, Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell. (Sonnet 93.) There is a third psychical quality requisite for a human beauty which, though somewhat difficult to define precisely, may be des- cribed as restraint, delicacy, refinement. It includes 'purity,' though that term is usually understood as having an especial reference to sexual indulgence. Habitual self-abandonment to any of the grosser physical pleasures results in a loss of sensitivity to finer shades of enjoyment, and especially in loss of sympathetic awareness of the feelings of others. Such a character writes itself, so we generally believe, in features which are heavy, coarse and rough in outline. We speak of a "sensual" face, and it is usually considered ugly. Moreover, on the assumption that we are in the aesthetic attitude and detached from the practical interests of life, the unrestrained expression of any emotion of the selfish order, such as fear, anger or pride, tends to provoke an answering revolt on the part of a beholder. He will be inclined to stand away from the experienced and with- hold a participating sympathy. On the other hand, there is a general fineness and delicacy of mind which expresses itself in features which can only be described as themselves delicate and refined and are capable of reflecting the subtler kinds of feeling. There need not be a complete absence of force and power. But it should be, we feel, force not fully expended, but kept in reserve. We cannot, however, say that the unrestrained expression of any overmastering emotion is inimical to beauty. There is a glow of self-devotion which may light up even coarse features and be counted as beautiful. In that case we should probably say that the beauty is given entirely by the expression and exists in spite of the homeliness of the features. There would be, in these circumstances, nothing to prevent an onlooker from being himself infected by the emotion and sharing sympathetically in the devoted love of which he sees the signs. I Burke: On the Sublime and Beautiful, Part III, Section i9. ii6</page><page sequence="6">THE MEANING OF BEAUTY No doubt a certain distinction is usually made between the sexes in regard to the, qualities mentioned. The qualities of tenderness and delicacy are felt to be more appropriate in the female face. Activity, strength and forcefulness, both mental and physical, are what we look for in the male sex. Tenderness need not be entirely excluded. The mas- culine face and figure expressing strength as well as tenderness might well be called beautiful, though, we feel, less appropriately than the ideal female face and figure. One might indeed venture to say that most men would be inclined to resent being called 'beautiful.' They would feel it implied a certain tameness and lack of forcefulness. In the foregoing we have tried to describe only the simpler kinds of emotion or feeling as they show themselves in outward form. There are more complex and mixed emotions, for example anger or indignation against one person prompted by love for a third person. Our life in a family and society no doubt leads us to very fine dis- criminations of meaning in the attitudes and expressions of others. But the more complex they are, the more difficult is such interpre- tation. That attribution of inner or spiritual character, which, as we have maintained, leads us to call persons beautiful or ugly, can only take place on broad general lines. The more complex emotions can hardly write themselves in definite outward forms which can be called beautiful or ugly. We have little doubt about attributing to the higher animals a conscious life roughly similar to our own. The Arab horse, pacing over the desert, seems to be expressing an inner pride in its own capacity for speed and strength, while it restrains itself in self- mastery and keeps something in reserve. The gazelle may have a lightness and grace in its movements, bespeaking a light-hearted and happy disposition of mind. That which we call a graceful move- ment is one which shows a unity of direction and organic wholeness, and within this unity diversions and transitions carried out without friction or jerkiness, but rather with an easy successful mastery. The hippopotamus, on the other hand, though we may think of it as good natured and therefore regard it with a certain amused toler- ance, seems to us to express in its form and movements a heavy and coarse type of mental life. We should never call it beautiful, as we should the horse or the gazelle. We call animals beautiful or ugly according as they seem to bespeak in their shape and movements a kind of life into which we enter with satisfaction or its opposite. It is quite possible, so we may come to admit on reflection, that we may be mistaken in our attributions of mental life. The hippopotamus may be, for all that we know, as proud and sensitive as the Arab horse. But our immediate, and apparently incurable, tendency is to attribute a mental life on the basis of the analogy of our own expres- sive movements. "I7</page><page sequence="7">P H I L O S O P H Y As we proceed downwards in the scale to the less complex forms of life, reptiles, fish, insects, bacteria, plants, we become, so far as our rational and conscious thinking is concerned, more and more doubtful about attributing any sort of mental life. Finally, at the lower end, we may be inclined to assimilate the behaviour of the living thing to the mechanical or chemical reactions of the inanimate world. But it is extremely difficult to draw a hard and fast line at any point between 'living' and 'dead' matter. Some have refused to do so, and have supposed that the bond which holds an atom together may be in essence identical with the integrated wholeness of an organism. The attempt at rational thinking on these subjects is, however, not the whole story. There are other tendencies in us which are instinctive and not directly rational. There is an innate need in man to feel himself surrounded by a world of living beings, not by one which is entirely dead and unresponsive. To apply such labels as 'social' or 'gregarious' instinct, or 'primitive animism,' to this ten- dency is not an explanation. Such labels only put the explanation further back. What seems innate is an impulse to treat separate objects, confronting us and interacting with ourselves, as beings on the same plane of existence as ourselves, and to feel some satisfac- tion in so doing. It is certainly difficult to imagine that such an impulse ever had a beginning trom a state in which not a hint of it already existed. It looks like something inherent in mind (or life) itself. Be that as it may, it is clear that it is inborn in human beings as they exist now. Language, moreover, though consciously learnt and not inherited, embodies, as handed down from generation to generation, the ideas of our primitive ancestors. Hence it comes that animistic ideas continue to influence automatically the ideas even of the civilized and developed adult. Only now there is a difference from the primitive mode of thought. The tendency of the primitive mind is to treat as animate especially those objects which interact with its own life and may affect it for good or evil. The ideas of animism had their chief source in the interests of practical life, as is shown by their application in magical ceremonies. The more advanced mind has found that it works better to separate off a class of the inanimate and to treat it purely from the outside as something in the main inert and unresponsive. Where we continue to attribute life and mind to things is rather in the state of disinterested contem- plation, when we seem to give ourselves over to the object without regard to any immediate practical interest of our own. What we are describing is that psychological fact which has been called Einfiihlung in German and in English 'empathy.' Immediately and unconsciously, as it seems, we ascribe to an object, provided it gives us by its separable form some sort of an initial clue, the same ii8</page><page sequence="8">THE MEANING OF BEAUTY kind of emotion and feeling as we should have if we were in the situation of that object. There is no awareness that the attribution of feeling comes from ourselves. It seems rather as though it is the object that is infecting us with the feelings. The torrent is to us angry or impetuous, the slow river calm and lazy. A mountain peak may appear to us as though it had a keen and springing vitality of its own, by reason of which it penetrates to the upper air, over- coming those laws of gravitation which always bind down our actual movements. The form of the oak suggests a sturdy, rugged character, that of the birch one which is lighter, more ethereal and gracious. In the vegetative life of nature in general, at least in our temperate climate, there appears a slow unhurried rhythm of regularly repeated change, which contrasts with the abrupt changes and shocks which are always possible in human society. Combined with the rounded outlines and gently modulated colours typical of the English scene, this makes up the main part of the beauty of an English landscape. In a sunset too there may be a combination of qualities working together so as to produce a total effect of beauty. It is possible that the colours by themselves and by their contrasts and harmonies may produce a favourable physiological effect which is pleasant to us. But beyond and more important than this, there is the suggestion of psychical qualities. The colours melt into each other by insensible gradations, giving the effect of gentleness and tenderness. This effect blends with the suggestion of peace given by the slow change to darkness, the time of rest and sleep, in Henley's words "the sundown splendid and serene." And yet at the same time any incipient depression that might result is relieved by a sense of the opening up of an infinite distance, into which one can be drawn and released from the restricting bonds of the narrowly physical. It remains true that, as with persons, the attribution of spiritual characters, which leads us to call natural scenes and sounds beautiful or ugly can only take place on somewhat general lines. Complex individualized emotions can hardly be expressed by nature. Meredith said of the lark's song that it was Seraphically free Of taint of personality. This should not be taken to mean that it is devoid of all definite character. The notes of the dove are different from those of the lark. The one seems to us to express a peaceful and tender joy, the other a wholehearted and self-forgetting rapture. Both differ from the harsh and gloomy croaking and squeaking of various other birds. Each of them has its own broadly simple spirit and ethos. What all of them are free from are the complex individual peculiarities of our fellow human beings, adjustment to which in a society is so often bothersome. II9</page><page sequence="9">P H I L O S O P H Y Subconsciously, no doubt, in all these experiences we must retain an awareness of the 'unreal' nature of the qualities believed to exist in the object. But our whole state is one of detachment from the question of reality and unreality. We live in a whole of feeling, in which the cognitive distinction between self and object is suspended. The preliminary conclusion that emerges from the foregoing is that no object is beautiful unless it seems by its outward appearance to express a real human value, which the onlooker, being himself human, is able to share, and that the epithet of beauty is more specifically applicable when the valuable quality is a harmony of instincts or impulses resulting in inner peace, of which the active and positive side is a tendency to diffuse outwards the same spirit of harmony, and which is accompanied by a certain reserve and self- mastery in the expression of all the emotions. These valuable qualities can only be shown completely in a human form. Other things are called beautiful in so far as they approximate to such completeness, or show some one or other of the qualities mentioned. The objection that might perhaps be made is that each race naturally prefers its own type of beauty, and that what we have been saying has in view only the human type preferred by the modem races of European extraction. The answer is that the pre- ference of each race for its own type is mainly a matter of sex attrac- tion. But sex attraction has no direct relation to the aesthetic experience. Sex is one of the most important and urgent of the instincts of ordinary life, human as well as animal. The experience of beauty can only occur when men detach themselves from any thought of the satisfaction of such instincts and give themselves up unreservedly to live with the life of a contemplated object. It is probable that the nearer to the animal is the mental life, the less is man capable of that kind of disinterested contemplation, and the more he is under the sway of pure instinct. The true experience of beauty is only possible for a mind at a high stage of development. But obviously not all the forms given us in nature appear as carrying meanings with a positive value. Some, as indeed has already been implied, seem to embody feelings repellent to us. A mountain mass, however lofty, which is broad in proportion to its height and rises in an undifferentiated curve to a rounded top, may appear to us as a mere dull lump on the earth, or, if we vivify it at all, as something "crouching" or "squatting" on the earth. Many cactus forms seem as though they were the expression of a dull, clumsy and brutish kind of life, different from the free and graceful life of the lily or the rose. The tarantula looks like the embodiment of a savage cruelty which is at the same time mean and stealthy. The whole course of nature even, in certain climates, may seem to us neither restful nor beneficent, but rather harsh, violent and cruel. It is in I20</page><page sequence="10">THE MEANING OF BEAUTY experiences of this kind that we have the main source of the ugly. In all cases of pure contemplation, divorced from practical needs, there is the tendency for the mind to impute life outside itself, and merge itself in that life. In the case of the ugly that impulse exists but is opposed by other pre-existing tendencies of the mind. We can "understand" the inner life of the object, and to understand is an incipient re-living. Such re-living is repellent to the mind in virtue of its pre-existing principles. The mental state is therefore one of discord. The object still has a spiritual meaning. If it did not, it would cease to be ugly and become a purely material thing, indif- ferent as regards feeling. But aesthetic absorption cannot develop itself. There is the beginning of a felt separation between the mind and its object. Instead of there being one whole of feeling, which includes the mind and its object, the latter tends now to become something other than and alien to the mind. The value of successful attainment and the resulting harmony and peace is not the only value of life. Life is essentially conative, it is made up of the pursuit of goals. With attainment there is relaxa- tion and pleasure, which of itself is undoubtedly a value. But in the pursuit also there is a possible value, that of tension, vividness and excitement. It is not derived only from the anticipatory foretaste of success. It rather consists in the fact that, when all the powers, bodily and mental, are fully called out and engaged, life seems to be lived on a higher conscious level. Many have felt that, if all wishes were to be satisfied at once without effort, life would be intolerably flat and dull. The values expressed in beauty are essentially akin to those of success rather than those of pursuit. They are those of home-coming, of rest from effort and tension, and they are con- stantly liable to fall into that insipidity, which is sometimes called "prettiness." There can be not only objects which express harmony and repose, but also those embodying force, vigorous tension, a vivid and exciting life. In many aesthetic theories the experience of sublimity has been distinguished from that of beauty. The former, that of sublimity, has usually been analysed as consisting in an initial phase of abasement or fear in the face of great power, followed by a realization that it does not directly threaten danger to us and that we can thus participate in its life and enjoy the sympathetic consciousness of power. But, in view of the initial phase, this does not normally take place so unreservedly as with the beautiful. Some of the examples of "empathy" already given should perhaps be considered cases of sublimity rather than of beauty. A tremendous torrent affects us at first with awe and fear, as do some mountain scenes, such as the ice-fall on the approach to Mount Everest. It is not impossible that in these there may be a certain combination of the elements of beauty and sublimity. A 121</page><page sequence="11">P H I L O S O P H Y mountain peak may appear to soar into the sky, defying the down- ward force of gravitation. But in the lines of its form it may then suggest that, with its end attained and with the tension over, it endures permanently in a state of majestic repose. Anticipating for the moment the later discussion of art we can say that a similar state of majestic repose is what the Greek sculptors tried to express in their colossal statues of Zeus and Pallas Athene. An increased intensity and vividness of life can be attained in various ways, to some of which the term sublimity may seem hardly appropriate. But we must, I think, recognize a kinship between the experiences concerned. The primary effect of suffering is to disorganize and weaken the mental life. But a man may have the strength of mind to face the suffering and rise superior to it, obtaining in this wav a depth of character which he did not have before. This value, which we sometimes observe in real life, is that which the art form of tragedy aims at re-creating. As a manifestation of strength and power it has its affinities with the sublime.' Even some kinds of humour can be related to the same general value. In such characters as Shakespeare's Falstaff and Rabelais' Panurge we find a rollicking energy of life, life playing with itself in its exuberance, which exhila- rates us by its contagion. It is much more akin to the value of force and vividness than that of harmony and beauty. It has been asserted in the foregoing that the aesthetic experience occurs primarily in face of nature and prior to art, when men, con- templating nature with some measure of detachment from the practical interests of life, felt that the objects they saw were the expression of certain values of their own mental life. The impulse to art arises when a man, having had valuable experiences in life, or having been moved to imagine valuable experiences of the sort which could occur in real life, feels the need to externalize and record such experiences in a permanent form, both so as to make them clearer and more real to himself and to make them available for others to share. These ends may be obtained by the direct imita- tion of natural objects (including human and animal figures) which appear as either beautiful or sublime, or they may be obtained by other than directly imitative means, e.g. by descriptions in words or by the creation of visual or auditory patterns, which appear as expressing similar values. As there are two kinds of value pervading life, those of attain- ment and those of pursuit, there is of course a similar division to be found in the values of art. It has been brought out especially clearly in modern times. In much of specifically "modern" art, as it is usually called, there is a selection of scenes and figures that are I The subject has been more fully dealt with in my article in Philosophy, April 1942. I22</page><page sequence="12">THE MEANING OF BEAUTY tense and vivid rather than those of harmony and beauty. There has been a deliberate revolt against what is thought to be a tendency to tameness, insipidity or "prettiness," and a desire to jolt us into the pungent and exciting. Most modem artists would probably agree with Henry Moore when he said that "beauty in the later Greek or Renaissance sense is not the aim of my sculpture."' In literature there is the same contrast to be found. Take one of many examples which could be given. I have already referred to Henley's lines on sunset and death: My task accomplished and the long day done, My wages taken and in my heart Some late lark singing. Contrast this with Hopkins's "Spelt from Sibyl's leaves": beginning with the line:- Evening strains to be time's vast womb of all, home of all, hearse of all night. And ending with the line:- Where self-wrung, self-strung, sheath-and shelterless, thoughts against thoughts in groans grind. We should hardly call this beautiful in the sense of harmonious and peaceful. We should say that Hopkins has chosen for expression not the serenity of the sunset, but the tragic gloom of the end of day, with the winter sky seen through bare branches, while the intensity of the poet's feeling seems to force itself out in rhythms that are not flowing and graceful, but abrupt and laboured to the point of jerkiness. Of music it is difficult to say much, for two reasons; firstly because it is fairly clear that at present there is no adequate and accepted theory explaining the difference between harmony and discord in combinations and sequences of musical tones; and secondly because of the remarkable and unexplained differences between the kinds of music which different races and ages seem to enjoy. But in general terms, confining ourselves to the European tradition, we can see that the melody which is called beautiful is the one which, though it may pass through wanderings and deviations, yet always desires to reach an end term of repose, and that this depends on the principle of tonality. This principle has been given up by many modern composers, and the result for those accustomed to the older music may be very harsh and unpleasant. The fact is that these composers are not aiming at beauty. They aim at being vivid, pungent and exciting, at something which may have an effect like that of a bitter taste or a sharp cutaneous tingle, rather than at the soothing sensations of sweetness and softness. It is not the case however that this antithesis is confined to I Quoted by Herbert Read: Philosophy of Modern Art, 2o6 &amp; 7. I23</page><page sequence="13">P H I L O S O P H Y modem times. It runs through the history of art in all races and all ages. The figures of El Greco, sometimes contorted, stand out force- fully from their background, expressing a vivid intensity of feeling. Contrast with them the restfulness of tender feeling, depicted with a rounded harmony of form, in the Sistine Madonna and others of Raphael's pictures. In India we find the smiling Buddha, benignant and calm, which we are often inclined to call beautiful, and together with him strange figures of gods with many limbs, which seem grotesque to us, but which are plainly meant to show the manifold- ness of divine power and to excite terror or awe. In Mexican art there are figures of the Maya period showing balance and repose, while in Aztec art there are such figures as the goddess of death, showing her teeth in a cruel grin, the effect of which is increased by the symbolism of a necklace of skulls and a skirt of rattlesnakes. It should be hardly necessary to cite from Greek and Latin literature examples of vividness, energy and power as contrasted with those of pure beauty. We find however some recognition of the contrast even in the theoretical writings of critics. Longinus' treatise TEpt vi'ovs is usually translated 'on the sublime.' But i'oso is much wider than sublimity. The two chief sources of which he mentions are (i) grandeur of thought, (2) A vigorous and spirited treatment of the passions.' An outstanding example of the second which he gives is Sappho's Ode to Anactoria, which we should undoubtedly say is a poem showing intensity of feeling, vividly portrayed by accumu- lated images, but hardly sublime in the narrower sense. In this and other cases which he gives the value is one of power and energy, as contrasted with that of beauty. There have been objections made to the theory that art is the reproduction of valuable experiences, actual or imagined, which it is necessary to notice briefly. They can be summarized under two headings. i. If art is only the reproduction (or imagination) of valuable experiences, it could have no specific value of its own. The value of art would consist in the fact that, by its imaginative creations or re-creations, it is able to give us valuable experiences, which would otherwise be denied us. This vicarious satisfaction by means of the imagination would be nothing but a pis aller, the best substitute available when we cannot have the real thing, but only a second- hand affair after all. 2. The theory might be applicable to the directly representa- tional arts, such as painting and literature, which are capable of giving us scenes which it would be possible to have in real life. But it would not be applicable to the non-representational arts, such as music and the decorative visual arts, including architecture, which I C VIII, p. I3 of translation by Havell.

As regards objection i, if it is admitted that both natural scenes and the imitations of them by art can be appropriately called beau- tiful, the objection is not in strictness relevant to our analysis of beauty. Take any natural scene, say a view on Derwentwater or Loch Katrine. This scene in actual perception, a photograph of it, and a painting of it can each of them be naturally and appropriately called "beautiful." If this is the case, then each of them must be said to possess the essentials of beauty. And yet it is the fact that common opinion does pronounce that there is some special and distinctive value in art which is not found in nature, and if we are trying in this essay to interpret common usage, we should, by denying the distinctive value of art, contradict our own principles. I should agree that there is a distinctive value in art, which can be summarily described as follows. Every activity which takes place in the actual material world and in contact with other living beings is accompanied, because of this setting, by various strains and tensions. The activity, whatever it may be, takes place with a certain amount of friction and impediment. When the activity is represented in idea only, these frictions can be almost entirely eliminated. In the re-creation of the other values of life, the artist can add emphases different from those of the original, and give to the whole a different aura or atmosphere, resulting from the sense of freedom in the world of the imagination. This is, I think, what Wordsworth was thinking of when he said that, if he were a painter, he would add to his picture:- The gleam, The light that never was on sea or land, The consecration and the poet's dream. and William Watson has a similar thought: Forget not, brother singer, that, though prose Can never be too truthful or too wise, Song is not truth, not wisdom, but the rose Upon truth's lips, the light in wisdom's eyes. It does not seem necessary to develop the topic further here.' Though beauty may, in the imaginative work of art, be given a different spirit and form from that of real life, yet the content must be pro- nounced the same in both cases, that is to say, the outward sign and I A number of other theories could be quoted in support: e.g. Volkelt, System der Aesthetik, Vol. I, p. 42i et seq.

I25</page><page sequence="15">P H I L O S O P H Y expression of a fundamental inner harmony, which is necessarily psychical. The second objection mentioned above raises the question of aesthetic form. In a full discussion of this whole subject it would be necessary to make a preliminary investigation into the role of form in ordinary perception. It is not possible to do this fully here. It may suffice to make a short summary and to say that while the mind requires some differentiation in its field of perception and rejects complete sameness, or complete uniformity, at the same time it has a preference, within the differentiated field, for regularity and order. It wants the world confronting it to be made up of closed and separate forms, rather than an indiscriminate chaos, and further it prefers that these forms shall have some regularity, showing an intelligible law of their construction. In the apprehension of such regular and intelligible forms, there is given a feeling of intellectual ease and successful power, which has its own value. It may be an element in the total experience of beauty, just as the intellectual dis- turbance of the irregular may be an element in the experience of ugli- ness. But such values and disvalues are not peculiar to the aesthetic sphere. They are of the same kind as those occurring in science, in so far as it is an impulse to seek laws and uniformities. In aesthetic experience these values are not of such importance as in science. No doubt visual and auditory patterns must have some regularity or symmetry, if they are to be accepted as beautiful. But there are many works of art, particularly in literature, commonly recognized as possessing some element of beauty or greatness, which are very irregular in form, their whole value lying in the content expressed and not in their form. No doubt we sometimes look at forms in this purely intellectual way, and very often of course we look at the shapes of material things only in order to see whether they fit in with the practical purposes of our lives. But, as has been already stated, in the aesthetic experience we detach ourselves both from the practical interests of life and from the impulses which aim at the scientific knowledge of nature. We surrender ourselves to live in the life of the objects given to us. Contemplating in this way the shapes and movements of natural objects we can obtain in an imaginative form either valuable experiences, or others which are repellent to us and we reject. When we follow with our eyes even very simple shapes and patterns, a straight line, a curve, or a rectangle, it will tend to appear to us as the resultant of a movement which has been carried out and crystallized into a permanent form. In this way it can appear to us as expressive either of values or of disvalues. We need not go further into the origins of artistic creation. But it is plain that, when man began to construct artefacts, he very soon went beyond, the neces- I26</page><page sequence="16">THE MEANING OF BEAUTY sities of mere use and began to make forms which might be expressive of values, both for his own enjoyment and that of others. In so far as he copied the forms of nature he naturally chose those which seemed to him "good" and avoided the "bad." In so far as he created new forms not directly copied from nature, he similarly tried to give them a life expressive of positive rather than of negative value. Thus, to take very simple instances first, the straight line or the even curve is capable of being thought of as showing a firmly defined kind of movement and so as being decided and strong, whereas a line that is irregular and wavers will appear as expressing a spirit of weakness and hesitation. It is thus that we get the dis- tinction in aesthetic value between patterns which we call bold and flowing and those which we call feeble and uncertain. A graceful line is one suggesting a movement which effects its transitions with a harmonious ease and without friction and jerkiness. That which we call especially a beautiful pattern, as in the Arabesque or an illuminated scroll, is one which appears as the resultant of a series of graceful movements, balanced against each other and crystallized into a permanent whole, to which a further vitality may be given by a harmonious colour scheme. More complex human creations have nearly always been made for use and not only for ornament. There may be in these cases a fusion between the emotions connected with the use of a building and those expressed by the mere form of the structure. The soaring columns of a Gothic cathedral may give the impression of an aspiration upwards towards the divine, the vista of the nave, choir and altar may give that of the mysterious, with- drawn and holy. Auditory patterns are more difficult to deal with than spatial ones. We can see that in a beautiful melody there is suggested a sort of balanced form of movement. But the beauty is also dependent on the relations between the pitch of the various tones, which must have a certain concordance with each other. There exists no theory of the mutual agreement (or harmony) of successive tones which is accepted as even in any degree plausible. To some extent there must be involved the element of a merely sensory pleasure. Some writers on music have said that in a beautiful tune there seems to be a union of the sensory and spiritual which is unique and not to be accounted for.' No writer on general aesthetics is likely to accept this. It would mean admitting not only a unique musical value, but also presumably unique pictorial, architectural, etc., values. This would be the negation of a science (or philosophy) of general aesthe- tics. We can only hope that further progress, particularly perhaps in physiology, may help to solve the riddle of beauty in music. In the foregoing analysis of the experience of beauty a funda- I See Hanslick, Vorn Ausikalisch-Schonen, I32-3. I27</page><page sequence="17">P H I L O S O P H Y mental part is attributed to the process of "empathy," as the psycho- logical fact essential to aesthetic value both in the contemplation of nature and the creations of art. There are certain writers who have accepted such a theory for some kinds of art, but denied that it can be applied to all.' In empathy the work of art which we find beautiful is an objectification of our own pleasure in activity and our own vitality. An art reproducing this kind of value, so it is said, can only occur in a people whose relation to nature admits of this pleasure in its contemplation. But there is another kind of art, arising espe- cially in primitive peoples. These peoples, tortured by the confused and fleeting forms of the outside world, were governed by an immense desire for rest. The happiness which they sought in art lay, not in sinking themselves in the things of the external world, but in taking the individual thing out of its arbitrary and accidental character, in eternalizing it through approximation to abstract form, and in this way finding a resting point in the flux of appear- ances. Worringer gives as instances the dead form of the pyramid and the suppression of life in a Byzantine Mosaic.2 This, which he calls the impulse of abstraction as opposed to that of empathy, has reappeared in modem times as the expression of a despair ot and withdrawal from the world. Plausible as this analysis may perhaps seem, I would still main- tain that all aesthetic value, of which beauty is one kind, must consist in the affirmation of something positive and not in a mere suppression and denial. For a conscious human being there can be no value in a negation that leaves nothing positive to continue. All that there could be would be a value existing in the momentary awareness that the individual mind was passing into nothingness. There can be a value, of course, in a self-surrender to what is thought of as a larger whole of life, but the larger whole is necessarily con- ceived as possessing some sort of super-consciousness that includes the individual consciousness. The stiff figures of Egyptian frescoes and Byzantine mosaics are still alive. There has been no complete suppression of life, but an attempt to impose on the living form the character of the fixed and eternal, taking it out of the flux of mor- tality. The formal figures and the long steady gaze of the rows of eyes in the Ravenna Mosaics or the Wilton Diptych still mean life, but it is life informed with the solemnity of the eternal. There is a value expressed in them, that of any enduring strength, a solemn I See Worringer, Abstraction and Empathy, Transl. Bullock (I953), espe- cially I4-17 and 133-5.

Though the methods may be different, the end result in terms of human experience is that which we obtain from the major gods in the middle period of Greek sculpture. We can give ourselves up to this experience in a state which is that of empathy. Such values can only be called emotional. If gaiety and triviality are emotional, so also are solemnity and seriousness. Emotional states are not only temporary commotions of the mind. They can be steady and lasting, giving a background colouring to whole stretches of the mental life. The fundamental problem of aesthetics has often been put in the form of asking whether the aesthetic judgment "this is beautiful" is objective or subjective, i.e. whether it resembles saying "this thing is yellow" or saying "this thing is pleasant to me." The answer which I have tried to give is that it is like neither. It is much more complex. It is similar rather to a record of the process in which we are aware of the events of another mind; that is to say, neither objective nor subjective, but inter-subjective. It would be a case of individual mind seeking to discover other individual minds, akin in spirit to itself, in its environment. Sometimes the events attributed to another mind are repellent to us, and then the other mind tends to become an object over against us, its otherness being empha- sized. Sometimes they are congenial to us and then we tend to share sympathetically in them and to lose the sense of separation from the "other." In the case of beauty the experiences attributed to the "other," being of the nature of joy, tenderness and delicacy (or per- haps some part of them), are such that we can give ourselves up to them without reserve. In such a whole of feeling there can be as a rule no sense of illusion. Our feelings are real to us, and we have no call to question them. In so far as later we may reflect rationally on our mental process and become aware of a process of inference from external appearance to indwelling spirit, it becomes feasible for us to become aware of the possibility of illusion. In the case of human beings we have every right to believe that, while there is always a certain gap of uncertainty as between bodily manifestation and mental event, yet as a rule our interpretation of the former is correct. As we proceed downwards to the "lower" forms of life and to material things we have to admit there must often be illusion in the attribution of spiritual qualities, even though it is difficult to draw a hard and fast line at any point. Whether anyone who shares a pantheistic belief with Wordsworth and other poets is entitled to feel that such a belief affords a certain justification for the attribu- tion of spiritual qualities to material things is at least doubtful. A soul diffused throughout the universe would be quite a different thing from a plurality of souls each with its separate material body. We are not called on to pursue this subject here. It is consistent with C I29</page><page sequence="19">P H I L O S O P H Y our general treatment in this essay to call beauty an attribute properly applicable only to the phenomenal and the finite, not to ultimate physical reality or to the whole of things. Where we have to struggle to comprehend the infinitely great and the infinitesimally small, the world of galaxies and that of the interior of the atom, we have quite got beyond the sphere in which aesthetic adjectives are usable. In the case of art, we know for certain that the object created by the artist, if we take it strictly by itself, cannot share in our valuable experiences. Yet the artist himself must have had them or he could not have created objects which express them. Thus in art we can believe that the experience which we enter into and re-live is that of the artist himself. It is not a legitimate charge against these ideas that they are "anthropomorphic." I would suggest that to us as human beings it is only human experiences that are intelligible, and so that it is not only legitimate but the only available procedure to try to under- stand beauty in general by reference to the standard of human beauty. Anthropomorphic standards are the only ones available to us. There are theories of beauty which try to take us beyond human experience and tend to lead into the semi-mystical and the vague. I have tried to set against these a concept of beauty as a human experience describable in definite psychological terms, linking it with other valuable human experiences. 130</page></plain_text>
