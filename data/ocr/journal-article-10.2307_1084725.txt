<plain_text><page sequence="1">Off Target Again: A Response to Schnaiberg Schnaiberg's letter commenting on Becoming Modern and its authors has a rather "doomsday quality" to it that leads the reader to infer substantial personal hostility towards Inkeles and myself on the part of our would-be executioner. There is also, undoubtedly, a substantial amount of ideological hostility, based apparently on Schnaiberg's view (shared by several others) that the concepts of individual modernity and societal modernization are conservative, capitalist ideas having no or little relevance to the major social and psychological processes of the contemporary world. We would deny that characterization, argu- ing that the concepts are relatively neutral politically if properly un- derstood. Societal or institutional modernization is a process of such wide- spread note and concern-and a concept of such pervasive general use and utility in various social sciences as well as in public affairs</page><page sequence="2">Letters -that its purported "death" is a much exaggerated report, to para- phrase Mark Twain commenting on reports of his own death. Becom- ing modern and individual psychosocial modernity are concepts re- ferring to a process and state that are thought to parallel at the indi- vidual level of system reference the broader process of societal mod- ernization at the societal (or social system) level of system reference. The concept of individual modernity grows out of a widely accepted and useful social psychological perspective on human behavior that inquires into the socializing impact of social structures and processes upon individual beliefs, attitudes, personality, and behavior. In view of the apparent ideological hostility to the modernity con- cept referred to earlier, it is interesting to note that Marx was a lead- ing exponent of this social psychological approach when he argued that people's places in the economic structure of society determined their interests, outlook, and behavior (as members of various classes). It is also interesting that one of the foremost recent sociological radi- cals and students of Marx, C. Wright Mills, was so intrigued by this relationship between personality and social structure that, with Hans Gerth, he wrote one of the classic statements of this theoretical ap- proach (Character and Social Structure). But whoever invented, has used, or likes this social psychological approach to understanding individual character and behavior is re- ally beside the point. What is important in social scientific terms (which we take to be the principal current frame of reference) is whether there is or is not some demonstrable empirical relationship between a particular configuration of social structure and a particular pattern of individual character and behavior among those exposed to that social structure. And the test of our argument about the utility of the individual modernity concept must be sought, therefore, in em- pirical data on the relationship between what may be termed modern social structures and what may be termed aspects of modern indi- vidual character and behavior. The test of the value of the individual modernity concept is most assuredly not whether it is the only or even a very important factor in determining societal modernization (we shall return to this point later). Schnaiberg accuses Inkeles and myself of failing to address the various criticisms of our work raised in the several years prior to the publication of Becoming Modern. Yet the book is replete with attempts to meet all manner of criticisms we received bearing on the substance of our study. We made dozens of presentations of the results before numerous different audiences, and tried to sift out and deal with as many of the most telling criticisms or "challenges" (as we refer to them generally in the book) as we could. The fact that we were doing February 1976 301</page><page sequence="3">Letters this is the major reason why the analysis and writing of this book took us so many years longer than we planned. What probably bothers Schnaiberg (and perhaps others of our critics) so much is that we did not identify the sources of many of these "challenges" by name. We were primarily concerned with the intellectual and substantive aspects of the criticisms, and we are of course grateful for all those criticisms which helped us to refine and strengthen our analysis and exposition. The primary purpose of the volume was to make an integrated and coherent exposition of our study and its results. Now that we have accomplished this to our satisfaction, we are more than ready to deal with remaining criticisms as best we can and as they come to our attention. Until recently, our major effort has simply been devoted to finishing the central exposition of the study. Schnaiberg complains that Becoming Modern really tells us very little that is new about the causes of individual modernity. To reverse Schnaiberg's fallacious (because anthropomorphic and hypostatizing) metaphor of death, we might say that the birth of a new concept (such as individual modernity) in the social sciences is usually first met with denials of its relevance and utility, then subsequently by arguments that it is not new and that we knew it all the time. Leaving aside questions of the origin of the individual modernity concept (other than to say that we did not invent it), we believe a major contribution of our work to be the rigorous and systematic comparative attempt to measure individual modernity and its relation to specific individual modernizing experiences that involve exposure to modern social structures. What is new in our findings, therefore, is not so much that a certain kind of modern social structure (be it a formal school, fac- tory, agricultural cooperative, or mass media system) has a significant effect on individual modernity. Rather, what is new is our attempt to determine how much of an effect such social structures have and how comparable the effects are across countries having widely differing cultures. We did try to find out what in the factory has this modernizing effect on men (contrary to Schnaiberg's implication), but our conclu- sion was that only very modest differences in the effects of factory experience can be observed in factories of very widely differing character. Hence, it must be the most basic aspects of factory social structure that are responsible, aspects that are relatively invariant among factories. This is one reason why we would expect that similar results to ours would be found in similar projects performed in Cuba, China, Poland, Japan, or elsewhere. We do not argue that education or factory experience or any other single kind of exposure to a modernizing social structure is aprerequi- 302 School Review</page><page sequence="4">Letters site of individual modernity, contrary to Schnaiberg's implication. We are convinced that there are many different paths to individual mod- ernity and many different combinations of modernizing experiences that will result in such individual modernity. We have merely tried to focus attention on a few important paths and to measure their impact. Precisely how these different paths work their modernizing effects is a matter to be addressed largely by future research. We have a theory about how it works, as stated generally in our book, but the detailed proof of what types of learning are involved, and how, was not at- tempted by us. Only now that there is solid comparative evidence for the modernizing effects we hypothesized does it make sense to pursue such matters. For Schnaiberg to suggest such pursuit, as he does, is an admission of the reality of the effects on individual modernity he elsewhere vehemently denies. Schnaiberg attacks our measurement of individual modernity on a number of grounds. One criticism is that we abandon quickly our theoretical approach to scale construction and let the computer make our scaling decisions. This is false. All our OM scales reported in the book were derived from our theory. The direction of every item in every OM scale was based on what our theory suggested, even if (in a small percentage of instances) the item in a given country turned out empir- ically to be related in the wrong direction. All three OM scales (OM-1, OM-2, and OM-3) mentioned first in chapter 6 are purely theoretically derived, using different degrees of theoretical stringency (in terms of agreement among project analysts) and different types of item inclu- siveness (in terms of including behavior and information items or not). The OM-500 and OM-519 scales differ in being based on both theory and empirical coherence, eliminating those items that did not fit significantly with the large majority of OM items in terms of item to scale correlations. Further, all the major OM scales are highly intercorrelated, both the purely theoretical OMs-1, 2, and 3, as well as the mixed derivation OMs-500 and 519 (p. 96). It is particularly noteworthy that the large and purely theoretical OM-3 scale correlates approximately .9 with the latter two OMs that are used extensively in subsequent analyses. Further, we performed nearly every analysis reported in the book on all major OM scales, though for simplicity and reasons of space we report mainly on OM-500 in the book. The results when any other major OM scales are used turn out essentially the same; and if the shorter OM scales are used (as in a current article in the International Journal of Comparative Sociology), the main difference is that the results are a bit weaker in strength, owing to lessened OM scale reliabilities as a function of length. As for the fact that some items in some OM February 1976 303</page><page sequence="5">Letters scales correlate in the wrong direction relative to our theory, or do not correlate significantly in the right direction with the bulk of the items, this is to be expected. Indeed, if we had found our theory were perfect in every detail, that would be surprising. What counts is the overall "batting average" of the theory, not the presence of some items that are absolute or relative failures by various criteria. Schnaiberg is also confused, as usual, about our use of scale re- liabilities to confirm the quality of our theoretical construction of individual modernity. We offer the scale reliabilities and item to scale correlations of the theoretically pure OMs-1, 2, and 3 as primary support for the theoretical coherence of the OM syndrome as we hypothesized it. We also offer the scale reliabilities of OMs-500 and 519 for the reader's interest in assessing the confidence that may be placed in these measures as dependent variables in subsequent analyses. We are, of course, quite aware that the reliability of the latter two scales, with items selected on the basis of internal consistency, is not a strict test of the power of our conceptual scheme. Schnaiberg seems to complain also of the multiplicity of OM scales as if we had constructed them merely to confuse the unsophisticated reader. Quite the contrary, we constructed the multiplicity of scales in order to take account of a variety of possible criticisms that any single scale might be subject to. Each OM scale represents a different ap- proach to index construction in one manner or degree. And as noted earlier, we analyzed the results for all of them. We then reported in the book mainly on the results for OM-500; but the conclusions would have been the same on every significant point had we used OM-3 or even OM-1 in the book. Checking these analyses for different kinds of OM scales is again one of the reasons why the book was so long in coming. Schnaiberg's remark about our using the median cutting point for each item in a given country in devising our OM scales is also off the mark. For the kinds of OM scales reported in our book we were primarily concerned with cross-cultural conceptual equivalence, so that we could perform essentially six independent tests of our theory about how modernizing experiences affect individual modernity. To accomplish this, we sought as much variation in individual modernity as possible within our samples in each country by using a median cutting point of each country's own response distribution for each item, though we began with what we considered to be conceptually equivalent items across all six countries based on our detailed model of the modern man. We did not argue in the book that a point of OM scale score in one of the countries studied was identical with a point on the same kind of 304 School Review</page><page sequence="6">Letters scale in the other countries. We merely argued that the OM scales used were conceptually equivalent and that increments on a given scale in one country were similar in meaning to increments on that scale in other countries. The broad similarities in the strength of independent variable effects we observed across countries testify, however, to the fact that not only are the socially structured experi- ences similar in their impact on OM scales and individual modernity across nations but the OM scales themselves have very similar quan- titative meanings across countries. And finally, we have constructed another set of individual modernity scales called the "IM" scales that attempt to have strictly comparable quantitative meaning across the countries and samples we studied (based on virtually identical word- ing and cutting points in all countries for the subset of items used). As usual, these more strictly comparable scales give the same results as we have found for any other of the major or minor OM scale varia- tions we examined. Schnaiberg, like other critics, asks of what consequence is the indi- vidual modernity syndrome if it exists. He points out that it cannot account for the recent history of the nations involved, which is cor- rect, but of course it was never meant to do so nor is that a legitimate test of its value as a concept or of its importance as an element of the general modernization process taking place in societies all over the world today. The fact that other factors in a vast and complex histori- cal process such as modernization may be more important than a given factor does not make that factor unimportant, especially if one is alert to critical differences in level of system reference. We would argue that at the individual level of system reference where the aim is to understand the character and behavior of the common man in developing countries (among other things), the individual modernity syndrome and the individual modernization process that produces it are of great importance. The factors that produce societal modernization and their relative strengths involve different questions, although one factor in societal modernization is likely to be the aggregate level of individual moder- nity in prior time periods. Our study was not intended to show, nor have we claimed its relevance to explaining, what factors make for optimal societal modernization (whatever one's view of that may be). What we have shown is that individual modernity can be rather accu- rately measured in different countries so that future studies of societal modernization might do well to measure aggregate individual modernity over time as one factor in the dynamic process of societal modernization. Finally, Schnaiberg cites a recent paper by Armer as the crucial February 1976 305</page><page sequence="7">Letters evidence that should make all empiricists abandon individual moder- nity as a useful concept. From what I know of the paper, substantial multicollinearity of individual modernity and various demographic factors could easily account for the negative findings. But more im- portantly, "as any respectable empiricist knows" (to use Schnaiberg's tactics), a single confirmation or disconfirmation does not make or break a theory or hypothesis (and that of course includes our own study). All phenomena, particularly social and psychological phenomena, tend to be distributional in nature, so that there will always be circumstances, methods, and samples, to say nothing of analysis modes, that will permit one to accept or reject the existence of any concept of interest. Furthermore, the work of Robert Rosenthal on the social psychology of science has shown that the outcome of investigations is often strongly influenced by the interests or biases of the investigators. Under such circumstances, the quality of one's methodology and analyses becomes paramount in importance if the results are to be valid. And the long term truth value of a theory or hypothesis is best judged on the basis of a large enough body of independently per- formed research projects of high quality dealing with the subject of interest. It seems to us that many other researchers have also and independently confirmed the existence of something like the indi- vidual modernity syndrome (whatever items were used and whatever the syndrome was called.), including Armer and Schnaiberg, although they hotly deny it (choosing to see the level of interrelationship of various modernity items and scales as too low to be indicative of a modernity syndrome, whereas we would prefer to view the same data as evidence for a significantly, if only loosely, coherent syndrome). The Suzman chapter in the 1976 Annual Review of Sociology will review a good deal of this literature. On the other hand, it is still too early to tell empirically what differ- ence individual modernity makes in a variety of realms not actually measured by the OM scale or its equivalent. But then one would not expect a great deal of research to take place on the consequences of individual modernity until the existence of such a syndrome was quite firmly established. On the basis of our own and other studies both prior and subsequent to ours, we would argue that the existence of an individual modernity syndrome is pretty well established, as are a number of the important individual modernizing experiences that tend to produce it (though much more research is still needed on the details of such socialization/resocialization processes, and on the vari- ety of modernizing settings that exist besides schools and factories). Hence the time has come for a good deal more attention to the de- 306 School Review</page><page sequence="8">Letters monstrable behavioral consequences of individual modernity. If Schnaiberg has his way, that kind of further research will not be done because Schnaiberg "knows" that the individual modernity syndrome does not exist; and even if it did, it would turn out to be unimportant. Lesser mortals without his direct pipeline to Truth might still want to pursue empirical research in the area (though Schnaiberg has moved on to bigger and better things). One person's tombstone is another's milestone, and vice versa. Time will tell which is a more apt description of Becoming Modern.
