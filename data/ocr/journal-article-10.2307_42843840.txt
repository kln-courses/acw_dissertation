Silverman, University of California, Los Angeles [Ed. note: All page references in the text refer to Emile Gallé 's Ecrits Pour l'Art, Paris: Laurens, 1908] During the second half of the 19th century, European and Ameri- can artists sought to reunite art and craft and quested for an or- ganic style of interior design. Historians of art and culture have characterized these arts and crafts movements as "anti-modern- ist," as expressive reactions against technology and the emerg- ing mechanization and rationaliza- tion of social life. This inter- pretation dovetails with the ten- dency of historians of industrial- ization to view craft production as incommensurate with economic modernization. Yet the arts and crafts producers rarely manifested such a simple reactive stance against modernity. One area in particular suggests how craft ar- tists formulated complex and multi-facted responses to modern- ity: the interplay between art, craft, the market, and the ma- chine. In this paper, I will recover the vital interaction be- tween innovative craft style, mechanized production, and the modern consumer market in the case of Emile Gallé of Nancy, one of the originators òf French art nou- veau. A study of Gallé' s art, glass, and furniture factories il- lustrates the compatibility of artisanal tradition and economic innovation. It offers a case study of the adaptiveness , inven- tiveness, and progresiveness that Michael Piore and Charles Sabel have identified in the craft sec- tor, and will aid us in reevaluat- ing the "mass production paradigm" as the only road to modernity . [1] A practicing artist and writ- er, Emile Gallé was a member of the French avant-garde, and af- filiated with Symbolist poets, sculptors, writers, and painters, among them Count Robert de Montes- quieu, the young Marcel Proust, August Rodin, and Edmond de Gon- court. As an artist and philoso- pher, Gallé was deeply committed to exploring an alternative world beneath the surface of sensory ap- pearances. He conceived his glass and furniture products as sugges- tive vessels evoking the nuances of emotional states, the instabil- ity of the psychological depths, and irregularity and continually changing forms of nature . At the same time, he was trained to in- herit his father's business, a manufacturer of luxury artistic glass and faïence. Gallé did take over the family enterprise and developed the very forms of artis- tic modernism in the context of the commercial manufacture. As the factory manager, director of labor, and marketing salesman for his own manufacturing business , he was constantly pulled back to the pressing realities of the ma- terial world and successfully de- veloped an innovative and profit- able enterprise. His rich artis- tic imagination and technical skills as an artisan were matched by his diverse business talents; he actively shaped an internation- al clientele, invented new methods 39</page><page sequence="2">of labor organization, and incor- porated the most advanced technol- ogy into the process of fine craft production. How can we reconcile this profound devotion to the im- material, to the poetic flight from the world, with the focused anchorage in the world, with ma- terial success? How did Gallé simultaneously embrace modernist artistic theory and advanced eco- nomic practice? Gallé was not a split self, nor did he experience a tension between his aesthetic assumptions and his economic behavior. He forged a fragile balance between the imperatives of his artistic ideals and the demands of his com- mercial practice. I will suggest that Gallé integrated his belief in an impalpable and mysterious reality and his economic activi- ties by running his business on the basis of his aesthetic and philosophical assumptions . He elaborated a factory work policy, an attitude towards workers and the work process, and a production schedule which confirmed his ideal of nature as the source of crea- tivity, continual renewal, and unity in diversity. By transport- ing his aesthetic principles to his factory, Gallé subordinated economic profit and efficiency to his metaphysical and organic pro- gram. Emile Gallé was born in 1846 in Nancy, a center of both 18th- century rococo elegance and a vital tradition of luxury crafts . His father, Charles, had learned the craft of decorative porcelain design and worked closely with the skilled artisans in his small fac- tory. He made his name by revi- talizing part of the rococo lega- cy; rediscovering the ceramic molds from the 18th-century Lor- raine faïence manufacture at Saint-Clement, he re-issued them from his factory in many patterns . By the 1850' s , Charles Gallé had established a solid reputation for quality craft production and the patronage of many aristocrats of wealth and name, including Napo- leon II and Empress Eugénie. The Lorraine tradition and the paternal example formed the dual bases of Emile Gallé' s forma- tions. At the Nancy Lycée impéri- ale, Emile excelled in Latin, rhetoric, and French literature. After school hours, Emile learned drawing and decorative design and began at the age of 15 to supply floral compositions for glass and pottery decoration executed at his father's factory. From an early age, Emile expressed a fascination for nature . He wrote later that his family spent much of their time together in the garden, and that the family shared a "love for flowers," and a "cult of nature" (p. 239). At the lycée, Emile studied under the famous botanist, Professor Emile Godron, from whom he learned the variety and classi- fications of the many species of plant life. Between 1862 and 1866, he studied language, botany, and technical drawing in Weimar, Germany, and accompanied his fa- ther on business trips. In 1866, Gallé began on-site apprenticeship in the Saar Valley Meisenthal glassworks of Burgun, Schwerer &amp; Company, under the direction of his father's friend and partner, Mathieu Burgun. The war of 1870-71 shattered the Franco-German bases of Emile Gallé' s youthful apprenticeship. At 24, he enlisted in the infan- try and saw his native Lorraine partly annexed to the new German empire. While he did not fight for long, the Franco-Prussian War nourished what came to be Emile' s intense nationalism and anti- German sentiment. 40</page><page sequence="3">In the three decades after 1871, Gallé expanded and trans- formed his father's glass and faïence works and added a new factory for fine furniture manu- facture. Yet Emile Gallé super- ceded his father in the widespread public and official recognition granted him by the late 1880' s . In 1889, Gallé was decorated as an Officer of the Legion of Honor by the French government, who cele- brated his artistic crafts as agents of national economic salva- tion: in the context of increas- ingly intense international compe- tition, Gallé' s special products were officially construed as evi- dence of the inimitable gôut and qualité française which would as- sure France a coveted position in the luxury consumer market. The types of objects produced by Gallé, destined both for pri- vate patrons and the consumer mar- ket, were marked by a single and innovative artistic program: the creation of craft objects whose forms derived solely from living nature. Gallé rejected his fa- ther's design legacy, which he characterized as too imitative of outmoded 18th-century rococo pat- terns . As an initiator of French art nouveau, Gallé called for a new and modern style for the 19th century. Rather than the excesses of Second Empire pastiches, and the anachronistic heraldry of the rococo, Gallé quested for a new design language built on the sci- ence, poetry, and nuances of flora and fauna (pp. 237-276). Emile Gallé 's cult of nature pressed a science of observation into the service of a metaphysi- cal and metapsychical project. This formulation of a French mod- ern style as a nature style of in- terior decoration was made possi- ble by his profound adoration and immersion in the richness and va- riety of organic life. Gallé' s biographers have characterized his theory of life and attitude to- wards reality as "pantheistic" and as a form of "mystic naturalism." [2] This spiritual attitude had anchorage in a technical mastery evident in the many lengthy arti- cles on plant typology and classi- fication that he contributed to the Bulletin de la Société nan- céienne d'horticulture, and in his role as the editor of this journal after 1880. Yet Gallé' s scientific exper- tise was always a vehicle for other anti-positivist ideals. He construed nature not as a stable system presented to the senses, but as a vitalist reservoir pul- sating beneath the surface of ap- pearances. His was a nature of the dessous mystérieux (p. 16), where being was caught in an irre- vocable process of becoming. Gallé' s metamorphic and meta- physical attitude towards nature was shaped by Romantic and Symbol- ist art. Gallé stated that he read and re-read the work of the Nancy artist, Grandville, whose Les Fleurs Animées offered a com- pelling visualization of the con- tinuum of being; Grandville pre- sented plants invested with human characteristics, expressions, and emotions (pp. 212-216), thus fuel- ing Gallé' s anthropomorphism. He construed nature as a living force, where "secret voices" "ca- ress us" (p. 270). Gallé' s writ- ings reveal how he rejected the boundaries between animate and inanimate nature. He personified flowers and plants, describing them as women, who "smiled," "com- forted," and "seduced us" with the nuances of their lovely skin and variety of their outfits . In an 1894 evaluation of a flower show, Gallé discussed the hydrangea as a blossom of "exquisite nuance and 41</page><page sequence="4">tenderness" "which has put on its garden-party attire, its evening- gown, in order to please us" (p. 77). In the same article, Gallé called the rose the "eternally adorable queen" who "induces us to dream and dizziness" by the "scent of carmine, the flattery of nu- anced colors, and the velvety feel of its caress" (pp. 81; 102). Gallé tranferred this anthropomor- phic conception to his glass and furniture objects modeled on or- ganic forms; he conceived his works as "talking glass and furni- ture" - verreries et meubles par- lantes (p^ 316-317 ; 324 ; 337 ) , whose vitalist qualities confirmed the continuum of being Gallé as- sumed to unite animate and inani- mate objects. Gallé showed considerable in- terest in the poetry of Baude- laire, Mallarmé, and Maeterlinck. In an explication of his naturist art, "Le Décor Symbolique," Gallé cited passages from Les Fleurs du Ma 1 as statements of man's quest to penetrate the mysteries of na- ture, and, by extension, the re- cesses of his imagination (pp* 219-220). Gallé absorbed from literary Symbolism the use of na- ture in art as a means to evoke and suggest a reality beyond the world of sensory appearances. Rather than a model for descrip- tion and illustration, Gallé construed nature as Baudelaire did, as a "temple," a "forest of symbols" which could trigger, by association and ambiguity of mean- ing, emotional states and the elu- siveness of non-phenomenal reality (pp. 210-236). As a Symbolist, Gallé aspired to convey in his or- ganic art forms a sense of the im- material and impalpable; calling his work musique sans son and images sans formed Gallé conceived his nature-art as vessels of a pouvoir suggestif (p. 216). Gallé bound his work to Symbolism by is- suing glass vases dedicated to emotional states, among them the vases de tristesse, captured in dark hues and flowing contours . He further allied his art to Sym- bolism by carving inscriptions from Symbolist poems along the surfaces of his glass and furni- ture, inviting the spectator into the netherworld of Baudelairian "voyages," to hear the "murmuring depths" of the ocean and to attend to the "language of flowers and all things mute" (pp. 120-127). Gallé' s vision of nature of a dessous mystérieux extended not only to the world of outer organic life but to the inner world of the psyche. This conception of nature was directly informed by new French psychological discoveries elaborated by Freud's teachers, Doctor Jean-Martin Charcot of the Salpêtrière, and his rival, Doctor Hippolyte Bernheim of Nancy. From Charcot, Gallé absorbed the knowl- edge of the interior world as a sensitive nervous mechanism, and claimed that his art represented the exteriorization of the inter- nal world of the "vibrating," "palpitating" "life of the nerves." From Bernheim, Gallé be- came fascinated with the unstable, fluid, and febrile qualities of mind that Bernheim claimed shaped man's new-found receptivity to hypnosis and suggestion. Gallé considered his organic art works as agents of suggestion, as hyp- notic "inducers" of the "dream state" (p. 102; pp. 217-228) and as triggers of alternative, often hallucinatory mental states, what he once called the metapsychoses de nuances (p. 75; 198; pp. 139-141) . The philosophical, aesthetic, and psychological bases of Gallé' s vision of nature contributed to three essential assumptions, which would reappear as the organizing 42</page><page sequence="5">principles of his factory social relations and production policies . First, Gallé emphasized nature as the epitome of renewal, as the source of the unfixed and the con- tinuously changing. Renouveau was a central concept in Gallé ' s many writings and appeared in his art objects. He celebrated nature as bound to an eternal cycle of change -- daily, seasonal, and personal. This cycle transcended the vicissitudes of politics and history in an organic rhythm of birth, life, death, and rebirth. Gallé dedicated many of his de- signs to the theme of organic re- nouveau . Among them was a large armoire, called "Renouveau," which depicted the seasonal cycle of the harvest, from seed to wheat to chaff to seed, and a huge decorat- ed wedding bed whose headboard and endframe illustrated the passage from "Aube to Crépuscule." Second, Gallé glorified na- ture as a divine artificer, who never repeated herself; no plant, flower, or insect, however small, was ever exactly like any other. This model of the inexhaustible variety in nature nourished Gallé' s commitment to individual uniqueness and creativity. Gallé developed an ideal of the crafts- man as a "magician" who approached materials to "incarnate his dream" (pp. 350-352). Gallé saw the tools and varied substance of the applied arts as the multiple "stuffs to bend to his fantasy." Nature provided Gallé with the imperative to strive to transfig- ure all matter according to the nuances and shifts of individual mood and thought . Finally, Gallé formulated a vision of nature as a system of unity in diversity. The innumer- able and unique forms of organic life functioned by the coordina- tion and differentiation of parts in a whole. Gallé was awed by nature's binding power, which directed multiple and unique parts to an interdependent totality. The concept of the unity in diversity characterizing nature, along with the notions of creativ- ity and continual renewal, were transposed into social principles underlying Gal lé' s organization of labor and production. Let us now turn to a discussion of Gallé' s arts and crafts factories. Gallé' s father had provided his son with the land and build- ings for the manufacture of luxury glass and ceramics. Emile Gallé transformed the paternal inheri- tance by expanding the work-force, building new facilities, and in- corporating new and advanced tech- nology into the craft work pro- cess. Between 1884 and 1895, Gallé reshaped the glassworks into a large factory of over 300 work- ers, established a new furniture factory, brought in new gas-fueled furnaces and acid baths for the glassworks, and motorized machine- tools and mechanized saws for the furniture factory. By 1895, Gallé supervised a tri-partite craft manufacture consisting of glass, faïence, and furniture factories, situated in a wooded glen a few hundred yards from his family home (pp. 294-371). Gallé' s three-part factory ensemble in the woods was framed by a huge sculpted oak-carved por- tal, through which workers passed on entering each day. The portal, designed by Gallé in collaboration with the cabinet-maker and sculp- tor, Eugène Vallin, depicted parts of an oak tree and its leaves. Across a central panel of the door Gallé inscribed his naturist mot- to: "Nos racines sont au fond des bois" (p. 133). This motto ex- pressed both Gallé' s personal 43</page><page sequence="6">vision and the stylistic program of organic craft arts he directed and designed in the factories. The Gallé glassworks, the largest of the manufactures, con- sisted of a spacious two-story building, punctuated along the walls with tall, broad windows. The first floor contained the fur- naces where the glass was blown by the traditional teams of the se- nior glassblower ( souffleur) , his assistant (grand garçon), and a young apprentice ( gamin] . The furnaces were heated by the new method of coal-gas burners . In the central area of the factory on the second floor was Gallé' s own atelier, filled with plant speci- mens and shelves brimmming with vases, where Gallé experimented with designs and techniques. Sur- rounding Gallé' s atelier were the studios of his collaborators, who worked with him on new designs and techniques and prepared molds for varying types of glass vases, gob- lets, bowls, and flacons. The main area of the second floor en- compassed skilled craft workers engaged in a number of decorative functions, which were executed on the surface of the blown glass ob- jects. These decorators included enamelers, engravers, carvers, painters, and polishers, each of whom contributed a specialized part to the many stages of produc- ing a decorated glass object. The glassware produced at Gallé' s factory followed a two- tiered system. One part of pro- duction was devoted to pièces uniques , or pièces d ' art, which were luxury objets d ' art, either individually commissioned or cre- ated in a limited edition series . These items were personally de- signed by Gallé and his assis- tants, were usually free blown rather than blown in molds, and then elaborately decorated and finished. The clients for these items included illustrious figures from the worlds of politics, the arts, aristocracy, and finance, such as Edmond de Goncourt, Maur- ice Barrés, Marcel Proust, Madame Waldeck-Rousseau, Comtesse Gref- fulhe, Sarah Bernhardt, the Mar- quise de Bantes, Queen Elizabeth of Rumania, Baroness Adolphe de Rothschild, Jules Ferry, Antonin Proust, Tzar Nicholas II of Russia, and Louis Pasteur. The second part of Gallé' s glass manufacture was devoted to la série, - objects for the com- mercial market. This type of item was blown in molds and was typi- cally a "cased glass vase" whose relief surface was achieved by a new chemical technique of acid baths. The series production of these commercial vases combined the chemical process with skilled hand-craft labor. The blown and cooled vases were covered with white patterns, stencils really, which were painted in by hand by men and women decorators . The decorators covered the stenciled areas with acid-resistant bitumen of Judea. Then the vases were dipped in hydrofluoric acid baths by other workers, and the protect- ed pattern area emerged as a re- lief design. After repeated dip- pings, the vases were finished by hand polishers. Gallé' s furniture factory, a new addition completed in 1889, revealed similar characteristics to the glassworks. To maximize the comfort and health of his co- workers, he installed efficient water and heating systems and pro- vided numerous windows, suffusing the inner space with light and air from the outer wooded glen. The windows of the factory opened onto a parterre teeming with plants and flowers as a living library of de- sign. One room in the factory 44</page><page sequence="7">housed a library of botanical and dendrological illustration as well as a collection of natural history specimens (p. 360 and 366). Like the glassworks, Gallé' s furniture factory encompassed a multiplicity of skilled artisans who contribut- ed a particular skill to a multi- staged process for the completion of a single product. The work force was headed by Gallé himself, who collaborated with cabinet- makers and glass-designers on the type and shapes of objects to be executed. Gallé' s furniture pro- duction adhered to the two-tiered system which characterized the glassworks' commissioned pieces, uniques and furniture en série destined for the commercial mar- ket . Both the woodworks and the glass factory comprised a diverse number of skilled craftsmen, who plied their specialized artistic functions in tandem with advanced technology. In the case of the glassworks, the acid baths made possible a serial production of cased-glass vases, though this chemical process was preceded and followed by intricate individual handiwork. In the furniture fac- tory, new motor-driven machine tools were used in the initial stages of production. Gallé in- stalled a mechanized blade, which rapidly cut the basic shape, limbs, or other structural parts of furniture, which were then as- sembled, finished, and decorated by hand. The machine, nicknamed la toupie, the spinning top, was capable of building up a speed of three thousand revolutions per second and could cut 6 to 12 wood pieces per minute. This initial cutting process speeded up the structural preparation of the wooden parts, which were then re- leased to the deft individual hands of a variety of artisanal decorators . The coexistence of mechaniza- tion and skilled craftsmanship in Gallé' s factories should incite us to reevaluate the assumed subver- sion of craft skill by the advent of new technology. In Gallé' s case mechanization consolidated rather than eliminated fine craft handiwork. In the furniture fac- tory, the mechanical saws liberat- ed the artisans from the most rou- tinized and difficult of the early cutting prodecures, facilitating their concentration on the complex assemblage and intricate decorat- ing stages. The serial production of both glass and furniture was made possible by the new chemical and mechanical processes, which increased the volume of output without sacrificing the skilled handiwork executed by the artisan- al teams. Gallé himself explained how advanced technology could be adapted to artistic purposes; rather than replacing the individ- ual craftsman, mechanization bol- stered his position by rescuing the craftsman from the tasks too tedious and arduous to be done consistently by hand. With the aid of the machine, the skilled craftsman was freed to express the "intelligence and taste" that characterized a quality product (p. 364). In this regard, Gallé explicitly criticized John Ruskin for his regressive anti-mechaniza- tion. The machine was here to stay, claimed Gallé, and rather than lashing out against it, men should harness it to their own purposes (p. 196). Gallé' s friend and patron, Roger Marx, went on to challenge the English assumption that the division of labor was inimical to craft production. While the En- glish were wedded to a medieval myth of "one man, one product," the French tradition of quality crafts, from the Gobelins, Sèvres, 45</page><page sequence="8">and Aubusson manufactures to the pages of the Encyclopédie, was rooted in a complex and vital division of labor. Since the 17th century, argues Roger Marx, the highest quality crafts necessitat- ed the most extensive division of labor, in which a number of skilled artisans contributed a special part to the completion of one luxury item. If the machine as the enemy of craft was an En- glish myth, so too, according to Roger Marx, was the Ruskinian "division of labor as the division of man. "[3] Gallé1 s manufactures extended that French tradition in which the highest quality craft items were the product of the col- laborative efforts of a variety of skilled artisans, who contributed their particular talents to an in- tricate and multi-staged process. The marriage of mechanization and fine craft in Gallé' s facto- ries also suggests that certain sectors of the 19th-century craft industries were better able to adapt to advanced technology than others. Pierre Du Maroussem, a fin-de-siècle French analyst of the craft trades, discovered im- portant internal divisions within all of the major craft industries, from woodworking to toy making. Gallé' s manufactures would fit in- to Du Maroussem' s category of the haut luxe craft operation, the pinnacle of a three-tiered system of craft production. The haut luxe house, according to Du Maroussem, was able to afford ex- pensive new technology and could also use it to the benefit of skilled craftsmen. Much like the case of Gallé' s factories, Du Maroussem discussed how machines were used to free the skilled ar- tisan from routinized tasks to specialized artistic ones . In craft manufactures belonging to the sectors beneath the luxury houses, which would include the glass bottle works of Carmaux examined by Joan Scott, mechaniza- tion could have a completely dif- ferent and deleterious effect on craft skills. In the Carmaux glassworks new mechanization in- tensified production and threat- ened skills; in Gallé' s manufac- ture, mechanization increased out- put and consolidated skills. While Carmaux glassworkers , men- aced by a de-skilling impact of mechanization, formed a union to protect their craft, Gallé" s work- ers left no record of political agitation. Gallé' s writings sug- gest that his specialized craft work force was instilled with pride and identification with their co-worker-patron . Gallé' s ability to instill pride and cooperation in his craft workers partly derived from his special organic credo, which had moral, social, and commercial im- plications. Gallé directed his factory in accordance with the principles of his organic vision; he transposed his philosophical assumptions of nature as the source of renewal, creativity, and unity in diversity into social re- lations of production. For his laborers and himself he sought an organic work environ- ment. Not only were the three craft manufactures nestled in a wooded glen, but the outer air, light, and plants were always ac- cessible to the work force through the massive windows that marked all the buildings . The planted parterre and organic reference library in the furniture factory further emphasized the visibility of nature's forms in the midst of the factory. For Gallé himself, the factory represented the or- ganic integration of home and work-place. In his writings Gallé lamented that modern industrial production forced workers "far 46</page><page sequence="9">from their homes" (p. 226). In- stead he located his residence a few hundred yards from the fac- tory. And Gallé' s own atelier in the center of the factory posi- tioned him as physically present and closely bound to his crafts- men. The vision of an eternal cy- cle of patterned change and meta- morphosis in nature contributed to Gallé' s commercial policy. His glass and furniture objects con- tinually varied; even in his seri- al production he refused to stan- dardize and constantly changed the type, size, and shape of his craft line. In glassware, for example, the height of vases ranged from between 3 and 51 centimeters; in the 26 years between 1878 and 1904, there were 27 different dimensions for 42 types of items produced. In the furniture se- ries, Gallé shifted production types from small end-tables to other varieties of petits meubles, and had craftsmen draw oñ 5Ü0 types of special woods for surface inlay work and structural assem- blage. Even when certain glass or furniture types were becoming com- mercially successful, Gallé chose to vary, rather than regularize production. Financial incentive and the profit motive were subor- dinated to the ideal of creative renewal . Gallé sought continual inven- tion and was devoted to a relent- less experimental and creative process. Gallé was never satis- fied with any one type of object and consistently tried new tech- niques in developing his wood and glass pièces uniques. Rather than perfecting solutions already dis- covered, Gallé repeatedly moved on to new discoveries, engaging in risky experimentation rather than repetition. In the early 1890 's, for example, he began experiment- ing with chemical oxidations dur- ing the firing process, in order to achieve unprecedented colored streaking effects within the glass skin. Gallé ceaselessly expanded his repertoire of enameling on glass, evolving new enamel hues for firing on the glass at a se- ries of different temperatures. In 1897, he shifted to a new pro- cess which he invented: marquetry on glass, which involved a complex and very difficult procedure of pressing lumps of colored glass into the warm body of the object, which set in during the cooling process to resemble inlaid pat- ternings . Each of these technical experiments, and their execution, was very costly; they necessitated long periods of heating, cooling, and reheating, in which the risk of breakage and mistakes was very high . The final element of Gallé' s philosophically-inspired mode of production emerged in his organ- ization of the work process as a system of unity in diversity. He placed a premium in his manufac- ture on the variety of individual artisans who contributed their special skills to the completion of a single product. Gallé had the technology and technical knowledge to standardize produc- tion, which could have been used to eliminate some of the costly and multiple individuated steps that were orchestrated in the cre- ation of his quality craft items. Yet Gallé chose to retain the many skilled contributors to his pro- ductions in their integrity. He did not aspire to maximal effi- ciency and cost-cutting regular- ization; Gallé adhered to a work process which validated his moral vision of the unity and essential diversity in nature (pp. 346-367). Gallé' s respect for the com- plex collaborative process in 47</page><page sequence="10">quality craft production was nourished by "his own activity as a practitioner in the factory set- ting; he worked closely with other glass and wood craftsmen through- out his career and was deeply in- volved in the associative network that made his continually changing ideas for designs into concrete realities. Gallé' s reverence for unity and diversity in nature, and his valuing of the individual con- tributions to the whole product, were further expressed in an un- usual feature of his craft crea- tions: Gallé had his collaborators sign some finished products, alongside his signature. The in- clusion of testaments to the vari- ety of individuals who collaborat- ed in the long process from design to execution in the making of a craft object was very rare; it was a hotly debated issue in the French arts and crafts movement and was certainly absent in other manufactures of Gallé' s type, such as Tiffany and Company, and Bac- carat. Gallé' s acceptance of the indispensability of his co-workers in their signed presence in final products revealed his special mul- tiple roles as patron, chief in- ventor, skilled craftsman, and or- ganic visionary. Conclusion The unity of organic theory, artistic modernism, and manufac- turing practice in the case of Emile Gallé should induce us to reevaluate the modernist character of the arts and crafts movement. It should help us to rethink our assumptions concerning the in- herent tensions between arts and crafts on the one hand, and the machine and the market on the other. Gallé incorporated ad- vanced technology into his craft manufactures and adapted it to artistic and artisanal purposes . And Gallé also subordinated the quest for economic profit and maximal efficiency to the demands of his naturist philosophy. Thus, despite its costliness, Gallé con- tinually opted to change models rather than to standardize and to invent new techniques for produc- tion at the very moment when earlier techniques and models were becoming commercially suc- cessful. Gallé elaborated a fac- tory system and an attitude to- wards the work process that con- firmed his ideals of nature as the source of renewal, creativity, and unity in diversity. The relationship between art and manufacture in the case of Gallé may also contribute to an historical debate concerning the interplay of cultural ideals and economic decision-making among French industrialists. Gallé' s ability to direct a modern factory system according to aesthetic and philosophical principles has a striking resonance in French his- tory. In the classic thesis, French entrepreneurs are distin- guished by their capacity to sub- ordinate venturesome economic ac- tion and imagination to familial and cultural values. Yet if Gallé may illuminate this broader ten- dency in French economic history, he was also unique; for he did take risks, in action and imagina- tion, in the context of his fac- tory and production. These were risks, however, not in the service of mammon; Gallé construed them as risks that became "exaltation" by using the "modern scientific fac- tory" as a vehicle for "the flight to the land of the netherworld." Gallé' s many factory practices also provide a sterling example of the multi-valence and progressive- ness of craft production. Gallé translated scientific knowledge, technical modernism, and philo- sophical ideals into factory out- put. 48</page><page sequence="11">the resources and flexibility of the craft sector and the short- coming of the mass production modernization model are found in Michael J.
