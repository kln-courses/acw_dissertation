Francesco di Giorgio Martini, the similitude between man and city Diana I. Agrest Architecture from Without: Body, Logic, and Sex Somewhere every culture has an imaginary zone for what it excludes and it is that zone that we must try to remember today. For something to be excluded two parts are necessary: something inside, some defined entity, and something out- side. In our world of architecture and architectural ideol- ogy there is such an inside, the body of texts and rules developed in the Renaissance that, as a reading of the clas- sics, established the foundations for Western architecture, and which I call the "system of architecture." This inside has been transformed throughout history, sometimes more profoundly than at others; and even through the apparent breaks of the first decades of this century, it has remained at the very base of Western architectural thought. Logocentrism and anthropomorphism, in particular male anthropomorphism, have underlain the system of architec- ture ever since Vitruvius, read and rewritten in the Renais- sance and through the modern movement.2 This system is defined not only by what it includes, but also by what it excludes, inclusion and exclusion being parts of the same construct. Yet that which is excluded, left out, is not really excluded but rather repressed; repression neither excludes nor repels an exterior force for it contains within itself an interior of representation, a space of repression.3 The repressed, the interior representation in the system of architecture that determines an outside (of repression) is woman and woman's body. The ideological construct of the architectural system determined by an idealistic logic and a concomitant system of repressions becomes apparent in the role sex plays within it. The logic in the system of 29</page><page sequence="2">00 C a 77I t me 71 e u (o ? o "opt tr:C"4c t??evfrnvo rferr 3,Zb (7 no twneA&amp;se Vtac 4 Ip~ wkr i t on/?

Society establishes a certain kind of symbolic order where not everyone has an equal chance of fitting. Those who do not fit have to find their place between symbolic orders, in the interstices; they represent a certain symbolic instability. These are the people often called odd, abnormal, perverse or who have been labeled neurotics, ecstatics, outsiders, witches, or hysterics.4 In strange ways, woman has been placed in this category when she has tried to establish her presence rather than limit herself to finding a way of "fit- ting" within the established symbolic order. Woman has been allowed to surface from the space of her repression as a witch or as a hysteric and thus has been burned or locked up, ultimately representing the abnor- mal. Women who are the bearers of the greatest norm, that of reproduction, paradoxically embody also the anom- aly.' It is through her body and through the symbolic order that woman has been repressed in architecture, and in dealing with body and architecture the obvious question, What body? is the key to the unveiling of many mysterious ideological fabrications. Asking what body is synonymous to asking which gender, for a genderless body is an impos- sible body. In many of the important texts of the Renaissance, that is, the founding texts of Western architectural ideology, the body in architecture is not only an essential subject, but one, moreover, indissolubly linked to the question of gender and sex, a question that has generated the most extraordinary metaphors in the elaboration of an architec- tural ideology. The reading of these texts is a fundamental operation in the understanding of a complex ideological apparatus that has systematically excluded women through an elaborate mechanism of symbolic appropriation of the female body. Two scenes will be presented here, two scenes of architec- ture: Scene I, The Book of the Renaissance, and Scene II, The Text of the City. SCENE I: THE BOOK OF THE RENAISSANCE The Scene of the Repressed: Architecture from Within Architecture in the Renaissance establishes a system of rules that forms the basis of Western architecture. The texts of the Renaissance, which in turn draw upon the classic Vitruvian texts, develop a logocentric and anthropo- centric discourse that establishes the male body at the center of the unconscious of architectural rules and config- urations. The body is inscribed in the system of architec- ture as a male body replacing the female body. The Renaissance operations of the symbolization of the body are paradigmatic of the operations of the repression and exclusion of woman by means of the replacement of her body. Throughout the history of architecture, woman has been displaced/replaced not simply at a general social level, but, more specifically, at the level of the body's rela- tion to architecture. Architecture as a Representation of the Body The texts of the Renaissance offer a certain clue to the mode in which man's appropriation of woman's place and body in architecture has occurred in a complex process of symbolization that works at the level of architectural ideol- ogy, therefore at an almost unconscious level. Several texts are exemplary of this procedure in various degrees, particu- larly Alberti's De re aedificatoria, Filarete's Trattato d'ar- chitettura, Di Giorgio Martini's Trattato di architettura civile e militare and his Trattati di architettura, ingegneria e arte militare. And, of course, we cannot forget Vitruvius, whose De architectura libri decem is at the base of every Renaissance text. In the several steps in the operation of symbolic transfer- ence from the body to architecture, the first is the relation- ship established between man and nature through the notions of natural harmony and perfection.6 Man is presented as having the attribute of perfect natural proportions. Thus the analogical relationship between architecture and the human body appears to ensure that the natural laws of beauty and nature are transferred into 30</page><page sequence="4">Agrest architecture. The body thus becomes a mediator, a form of "shifter. "7 It is in Vitruvius that we first encounter the significant notions that will later be variously reelaborated. His text clearly posits the issue of the human body as a model for architecture, particularly in his chapter "On Symmetry in Temples and the Human Body," where he relates symme- try to proportion: The design of a temple depends on symmetry, the principles of which must be carefully observed by the architect. They are due to proportion, in Greek avanoyia. Proportion is a correspondence among measures of the members of an entire work, and of the whole to a certain part selected as standard. From this result the principles of symmetry. Without symmetry and proportion there can be no principles in the design of any temple; that is, if there is no precise relation between its members, as in the case of those of a well-shaped man. Further, it was from the members of the body that they derived the fundamental ideas of the measures which are obviously necessary in all works, such as the finger, palm, foot and cubit.8 The relationship between architecture and the human body becomes particularly important at the moment in which the issue of the center - a preoccupation that fil- ters throughout the history of art and architecture in its many symbolic roles - acquires a very specific meaning. Then again, in the human body the central point is naturally the navel. For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centered at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square.9 The center is represented by the navel, which becomes a metonymic object or a "shifter" in relation to gender. It is a true shifter in that it transforms the body into geometry, nature into architecture, the "I" of the subject into the "I" of the discourse. The relationship between these two "I's" is what allows the constant shifting of genders.'0 This type of formal relationship between the body of man and archi- v YP c RN~w.At nip' , ? . . .. ; .... . . . ............. ..

Di Giorgio, the generation of proportional systems from human physiognomy assemblage 7 tecture, developed by Vitruvius, will be everpresent in the Renaissance texts. An analogical relationship between the body (of man) and architecture can also be found in Alberti's De re aedificatoria: The whole Force of the invention and all our skill and Knowl- edge in the Art of Building, it is required in the Compartition: Because the distinct Parts of the entire Building, and, to use such a Word, the Entireness of each of those parts and the Union and Agreement of all the lines and Angles in the Work, duly ordered for Convenience, Pleasure and Beauty are disposed and measured out by the Compartition alone: For if a City, according to the Opinion of Philosophers, be no more than a great House and, on the other hand, a House be a little City; why may it not be said that the Members of that House are so many little Houses ... and as the Members of the Body are correspondent to each other, so it is fit that one part should answer to another in a Building; whence we say, that great Edifices require great Members."I Alberti is never as direct in his analogies as Vitruvius or as other architects of the Renaissance. His text offers a far more elaborate system of metaphorical transformation by which he develops specific notions that allow for the devel- opment of an abstract system in a discourse that incorpo- rates the "laws of nature." If what we have here laid down appears to be true, we may con- clude Beauty to be such a Consent and Agreement of the Parts of the Whole in which it is found, as to Number, Finishing and Collocation, as Congruity, that is to say, the principal law of Nature, requires. This is what Architecture chiefly aims at, and by this she obtains her Beauty, Dignity and Value. The Ancients knowing from the Nature of Things, that the Matter was in fact as I have stated it, and being convinced, that if they neglected this main Point they should never produce any Thing great or commendable, did in their Works propose to themselves chiefly the Imitation of Nature, as the greatest Artist of all Manner of Compositions; . Reflecting therefore upon the Practice of Nature as well with Relation to an entire Body, as to its several Parts, they found from the very first Principles of Things, that Bodies were not always composed of equal parts of Members; whence it happens, that of the Bodies produced by Nature, some are smaller, some are larger, and some middling.12 32</page><page sequence="6">Agrest The process of symbolization takes place by relating the body as a system of proportion to other systems of propor- tion. The body, transformed into an abstract system of formalization, is thus incorporated into the architectural system as form, through the orders, the hierarchies, and the general system of formal organization that allows for this anthropocentric discourse to function at the level of the unconscious. Transsexual Operations in Architecture Vitruvius and Alberti point the way to the incorporation of the body as an analogue, model, or referent, elaborating a system for its transformation into a system of architectural syntactic rules, elements, and meanings. Filarete and Di Giorgio Martini, further, eliminate the original ambiguity of the gender of the body in question by making explicit that the human figure is synonymous with the male figure. A different ambiguity will appear instead, the ambiguity of gender or sex itself. In a rather complex set of metaphori- cal operations throughout these texts, the gender of the body and its sexual functions are exchanged in a move of cultural transsexuality whereby man's everpresent procrea- tive fantasy is enacted. Filarete starts by making sure we understand that when he refers to the "human" figure or body, he means the male figure: As I have said, the building is constructed as a simile for the human figure. You see that I have shown you by means of a simile that a building is derived from man, that is, from his form, members, and measure. Now as I have told you above, I will show you how the building is given form and substance by analogy with the members and form of man. You know that all buildings need members and passages, that is, entrances and exits. They should all be formed and arranged according to their origins. The exterior and interior appearance of the building is arranged effectively in such a way that the members and passages are suitably located, just as the exterior and interior parts and members are correct for the body of man.'3 Here the conditions are present for the development of a double analogy and for possible exchanges and combina- tions in the body considered as interior and/or exterior.

Di Giorgio, anthropometric architectonic elements the most common and apparent analogical relationship between the body of man and architecture we are faced with the exterior. In bringing about the interior, another set of metaphors will be possible, particularly those that allow for the permutation of gender. In order to elaborate on the question of the interior of man, Filarete does not stop at the formal analogy; his symbolic operations lead him to develop his most extraordinary metaphor, that of the building as living man: [When they are] measured, partitioned and placed as best you can, think about my statements and understand them clearly. I will [then] show you [that] the building is truly a living man. You will see it must eat in order to live, exactly as it is with man. It sickens or dies or sometimes is cured of its sickness by a good doctor. In the first book you have seen, as I have demonstrated to you, the origins of the building and its origins in my opinion, how it is proportioned to the human body of man, how it needs to be nourished and governed and through lack it sickens and dies like man.14 In this manner he slowly and steadily builds up a symbolic argument that unfolds from the building created as a for- mal analogue of the male body, from which even the 33</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 7 orders are derived, to the building as a living body. If the building is a living man the next necessary step in the argument is its birth and its conception. It is at this critical point that another body will be incorporated: that of the architect himself. You perhaps could say, you have told me that the building is similar to man. Therefore, if this is so it needs to be conceived and then born. As [it is] with man himself, so [it is] with the Building. First it is conceived, using a simile such as you can understand, and then it is born. The mother delivers her child at the term of nine months or sometimes seven; by care and in good order she makes him grow.'5 If the building is a living man, someone must give birth to it - and here the architect appears in the role of the mother. The figure of the architect becomes feminized in the act of procreation: The building is conceived in this manner. Since no one can con- ceive himself without a woman, by another simile, the building cannot be conceived by one man alone. As it cannot be done without woman, so he who wishes to build needs an architect. He conceives it with him and then the architect carries it. When the architect has given birth he becomes the mother of the building. Before the architect gives birth, he should dream about his con- ception, think about it, and turn it over in his mind in many ways for seven to nine months, just as a woman carries her child in her body for seven to nine months. He should also make var- ious drawings of this conception that he has made with the patron, according to his own desires. As the woman can do noth- ing without the man, so the architect is the mother to carry this conception. When he has pondered and considered and thought [about it] in many ways, he ought to chose (according to his own desires), what seems most suitable and most beautiful to him according to the terms of the patron. When this birth is accom- plished, that is, when he has made, in wood, a small relief design of its final form, measured and proportioned to the fin- ished building, then he shows it to the father. 16 Filarete takes this transsexual operation to its extreme by transforming the architect into a woman - or better, mother. He proceeds to state that just like a mother, the architect must also be a nurse, and "with love and dili- gence" he will help the building grow to its completion: As I have compared the architect to the mother, he also needs to be nurse. He is both mother and nurse. As the mother is full of love for her son, so he will rear it with love and diligence, cause it to grow, and bring it to completion if it is possible, if it is not, he will leave it ordered.', Filarete pushes his argument all the way to cover the var- ious aspects involved in the building: A good mother loves her son and with the aid of the father strives to make him good and beautiful, and with a good master to make him valient and praiseworthy. So the good architect should strive to make his buildings good and beautiful." First woman is excluded (repressed) by making architecture an image of man as an analogue to man's body and, as we have seen, to the point of turning it into a living organism. Then, in an extraordinary operation that I call here archi- tectural transsexuality, for which her repression is essential, woman is replaced - her place usurped by man, who, as the architect, possesses the female attributes necessary for conception and reproduction. Filarete's texts are greatly complemented by those of Fran- cesco di Giorgio Martini. In his Trattato di architettura civile e militare and Trattati di architettura, ingegneria e arte militare, Di Giorgio uses similar analogies between the human body and architecture, but in his case the anal- ogy is proposed at the scale of the city. One should shape the city, fortress, and castle in the form of a human body, that the head with the attached members have a proportioned correspondence and that the head be the rocca, the arms its recessed walls that, circling around, link the rest of the whole body, the vast city. And thus it should be considered that just as the body has all its members and parts in perfect measurements and proportions, in the composition of temples, cities, rocche, and castles the same principles should be observed.19 Di Giorgio further develops this argument so that the ide- ology can be better translated into specific formal systems: Cities have the reasons, measurements, and form of the human body. I am going to describe precisely their perimeters and parti- tions. First the human body stretched on the ground should be considered. Placing a string at the navel, the other end will create a circular form. This design will be squared and angles placed in similar fashion. ... 34</page><page sequence="8">Agrest Thus it should be considered just as the body has all the parts and members in perfect measurement and circumference, the center in the cities and other buildings should be observed. .... The palms and the feet would constitute other temples and squares. And as the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, the veins, intes- tines, and other internal parts and members that are organized inside and outside the body according to its needs, in the same way this should be observed in cities, as we shall show in some focus. 20 The reading and reuse of Vitruvius takes on a new dimen- sion in Di Giorgio, for it is not only part of an analogical discourse between the body (male) and the city, it is at the same time central in a representational discourse where the roles and places of male and female body in relation to architecture are swiftly exchanged. It is in shifting from the external appearance to the internal functions and order of the body that we will be faced once more with a transsex- ual operation. And so as it has been said that all the internal parts [of the human body] are organized and divided for its government and subsistence, in the same way that inside and outside parts of the body are necessary, it is that each member of the city should be distributed to serve its subsistence, harmony, and government. ... I therefore say that first of all the main square [piazza] should be placed in the middle and the center of that city or as close as possible, just as the navel is to man's body; convenience should go second to this. The reason for this similitude could be the following; just as it is through his navel that human nature gets nutrition and perfection in its beginnings, in the same way by this common place the other particular places are served.21 But this can only be an analogy after some operations of substitution are performed: The umbilical cord is the tie to the mother, the woman. Di Giorgio says "like the navel is to a man's body," yet the relationship of the man's body to the umbilical cord is one of dependence. He does not pro- vide nourishment; rather, he is nourished by the mother at the beginning of life. Thus for this analogy to work for the city, the female body should be taken as the symbolic ref- erence; instead, it is replaced by the male body and man's navel is transformed into the city's "womb." In the produc- tion of this architectural analogy man's body is functionally transformed, feminized. iI St'- \5, c i p or*V vyl" itt iJVor~ 6. Di Giorgio, II Monte Athos Although Di Giorgio never mentions the sexual organs, they have an analogical presence in some of his designs for cities, where the male sexual organ occupies the place pre- viously analogically assigned to the various parts of the body. That which has been taken must be negated; it is the denial that goes with repression. I propose three instances in this play of substitutions: First, the male body is projected, represented, and inscribed in the design of buildings and cities and in the texts that establish their ideology. The female body is suppressed or excluded. Second, the architect himself is presented as a woman in relation to the reproductive creative functions, 35</page><page sequence="9">assemblage 7 7. Di Giorgio, fortresses operating as a "literal" sexual replacement. And third, the male body becomes the female body in its functions of giving nourishment, that is, life, to the city; man's navel becomes woman's womb. It is remarkable that the replacement of the female body by the male body always occurs in relation to the maternal function: reproduction. It has been said that we live in a civilization in which the consecrated - religious or secu- lar - representation of femininity is subsumed by the maternal.22 In this perspective, the whole operation appears to be a veiled representation of the myth of Mary. In Filarete, the architect, a man, gives birth like a woman. In Di Giorgio, the center of the city, based on the configu- ration of man's body, gives subsistence, like a woman's body, through the umbilical cord from the womb to the rest of the city. In one case men's fantasies of conception and reproduction are placed in the figure of the architect, in the other they are set in the principles organizing the formal configuration of the city. Woman is thus sup- pressed, repressed, and replaced. Suppressed, in the analogical relation between body and architecture. It is man's body that is, according to the clas- sic texts, the natural and perfectly proportioned body from which architectural principles and measurements derive. Repressed, in the model of the city. Woman's unique quality, that of motherhood, is projected onto the male body. Thus woman is not only suppressed, but indeed her whole sexual body is repressed. Replaced, by the figure of the architect. The male, through a transsexual operation, has usurped the female's reproductive qualities, in the desire to fulfill the myth of creation. Motherhood more than womanhood has been appropri- ated, but motherhood has always been confused with womanhood as one and the same: the representation of femininity is subsumed by the maternal. In the art of the Renaissance, Mary, Queen of the Heav- ens and Mother of the Church, was an everpresent figure. It is in this ideological context, that of Christianism, that the treatises of Alberti, Di Giorgio Martini, and Filarete were developed. (Fantasies of male conception can also be found in the texts of other men, including St. Augus- tine.)23 The power of this ideology was evidenced in the mode of representing religion and its concomitant myths. A most powerful one was that of the Virgin Mary. The nature of the mother/son relationship between Mary and Christ and the belief in the immaculate conception leads toward the possibility of pregnancy without sex: woman, rather than being penetrated by a male, conceives with a non-person, the spirit. This conception without sex (sin) is the negation of sex as an essential part in the reproductive process, and ultimately, in the birth of Christ. This religious ideology was all-encompassing. In a move of perfect ideological representation in a particular subregion of ideology, that of architecture, the architect, by usurping the female body, can give birth to buildings or cities, and just like Mary, he can conceive without sex, through spirit alone. Man is thus placed at the center of creation. The architectural treatises mentioned here develop a sys- tem of rules elaborating an ideology that allows for the transformation in philosophy, Christianism, and the power structure of the Church to filter through the subregion of architecture.24 Woman (mother/Mary) was necessary as an imposing image within the system; woman outside that system, if not suppressed, had to be burned. On the one hand, Mary; on the other, heretics and witches, those who pointed out the system of repressions and the possibility of a certain demys- tification. Men's mechanism of the assumption of the maternal role, through Christianism, may also be a mech- anism of masculine sublimation.25 36</page><page sequence="10">Agrest SCENE II: THE TEXT OF THE CITY The Return of the Repressed: Architecture from Without The system of architecture from within is characterized by an idealistic logic that can assume neither contradiction nor negation and, therefore, is based upon the suppression of either one of two opposite terms. This is best repre- sented by the consistent repression and exclusion of woman. Woman does not fit the symbolic order; she is offside, in the cracks of symbolic systems, an outsider. It is in that outside that we stand. It is from that outside that we can project better than anyone the critical look. Woman can place herself from without the system of architecture by accepting heterogeneity and by including positively the negated, woman herself. In the ideological realm of architecture this implies the negation of the "sys- tem of architecture" through a critical work and the inclu- sion of the denied, the excluded, the hidden, the repressed. This discourse from without incorporates heterogeneous matter, includes negation, and is psychoanalytical and his- torical. Woman, representing both the heterogeneity of matter through her body26 and the historical negation of her gender, is in the perfect position to develop such a discourse. Woman, a discourse of heterogeneity, "represents the negative in the homogeneity of the community. "27 To take a place from without the system is not simply to include what has been negated, or excluded, or to surface the repressed: a more complex process occurs. The classic architectural project of the city (as a body) is a reflection in the mirror of a totally formed, closed, and unitary system. We are dealing now instead with a representation of a frag- mented body. 28 The architect cannot recognize himself or his system of rules in the mirror of the city as did Di Gior- gio or Filarete. The body as a metaphor of the fragmented architectural body, which cannot be recomposed within the system of architectural rules, will be that referential outside. It is the explosion, the fragmented unconscious, where the "architectural body" does not reflect the body of the sub- ject, as it did in the Renaissance, but instead reflects the perception of the fragmented body as the built text, a set of fragments of languages and texts, the city. The body can- not be reconstructed, the subject architect/man does not recognize itself in architecture as an entity in front of the mirror. The system has been broken; architecture cannot be recognized again as a whole. We will take that built social unconscious of architecture, the city, a text, for it is not the result of the creation of a subject, product of a logocentric, anthropomorphic system. There is no subject. Here are only fragments of texts and languages to be read, and in this reading they traverse the subject, in the position of reader-writer. The Street: Streetwalkers The city presents itself as a fragmentary text escaping the order of things and of language, a text to be "exploded," taken in pieces, in fragments, to be further decomposed in so many possible texts, open in a metonymy of desire. To design is not to reclose but to affect the openings and be affected by them to play an intersection between the two subjects, that of the reader and that of the writer, by an operation of shifting through the "I." The subject gets caught in the text and becomes part of the text. This subject, woman, writes as she reads, where the repression has failed, where the system is fragmented, and where she does not want to be reconstructed by finding in it the reflection of an enclosed, homogeneous, unitary sys- tem. She reads there and activates the absence of the repression/replacement of her body. The street is the scene of her writing, with her body fol- lowing the role that she is given in the evaluation of her body as merchandise. The street is the scene of architec- tural writing. The private realm is the scene of the institu- tion, where woman and her body have an assigned place: the house. Wife in the kitchen. Whore in the street. 37</page><page sequence="11">assemblage 7 38</page><page sequence="12">Agrest 8. Diana Agrest, Park Square, Boston: A Fiction, 1978 39</page><page sequence="13">assemblage 7 Rather than worshiping the monuments, we take the streets, we "play house," taking a critical view of the family as a hierarchical system and of the rules of architecture that go with it. The city is the social scene where woman can publicly express her struggle. She was/is not accepted in the institu- tions of power; she is dispossessed (of her body) and is with the dispossessed. The public place is a no-man's-land ready to be appropriated. The scene of the city, of the street, of the public place is that of the dispossessed; there she is "at home." (A place outside the accepted institutions is taken and assumed through various texts and readings of an open and heterogeneous quality.) Reading from Without I think of this project. I have a vision, a realist image of unreal events. It flows without knowing like a mystic pad; the city like an unconscious of architecture unveils itself, three modes of time in three analogues of experience: per- manence, succession, simultaneity. A register of urban inscriptions, these three together - now I am reading, now I am writing - the boundaries are not clear. I can read the words, the unsaid, the hidden, there where no man wants to read, where there are no monuments to speak of an established and unitary system of architecture. Like an optical illusion the grid becomes an object, then the fabric, then the object again. The apparent contradic- tion and undialectical opposition between object and fabric at the base of this process develops a text from the inclu- sions and juxtaposition of these opposite terms. All of a sudden an erasure, the erasure necessary to remark, reinstate the obvious not seen, the tabula rasa that could become fabric, the object that would rather be a public place. The refoules (repressed) of architecture, the public, the negation all become the material of my fictional configura- tion. The (project) marks I make are organized through a contradiction - a negation through an affirmation. Negate the city to affirm the city. It is the affirmation of the era- sure of the city in order to reinstate its trace. The critical reading is taken from the subject: I am spoken through the city and the city is read through me. Notes This text originated in the fall of 1971 as a proposal for an article to be entitled "Architecture from Without: Matter, Logic, and Sex." Although my interest in the mate- rial was very strong at that time, I did not have the opportunity to develop it until 1986-87. The orig- inal abstract was only four pages long, but it contained all the ele- ments necessary to develop this article. During the process of development, I realized that the second part, "Architecture from Without," could not be expanded in the same manner as the first part, "Architecture from Within." For the later section posits a prem- ise for and an approach to critical work. I believe that this critical approach to architecture is present in my work produced throughout these years in practice, theory, criti- cism, and teaching. I want to thank Amy Miller and David Smiley and especially Judy O'Buck Gordon for her initial incentive and persistent interest in this essay. 1.

I told you they were called by their Greek names, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian. The Doric I told you is one of the major quality; the Corinthian is in the middle, the Ionic is the smallest for the reasons alleged by the architect Vitruvius in his book [where] he shows how they were in the times of the emperor Octavian. In these modes the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian corre- sponded in measure to the form or, better, to the quality of the form to which they are proportioned. As the 40</page><page sequence="14">Agrest building is derived from man, his measures, qualities, form and pro- portions, so the column also derives from man: The polished columns, according to Vitruvius, were derived from the nude man and fluted from that well-dressed young woman, as we have said. Both are derived from the form of man. Since this is so, they take their qualities, form and measure from man. The qualities, or better Ionic, Doric and Corin- thian, are three, that is large, medium and small forms. They should be formed, proportioned, and measured according to their quality. Since man is the measure of all, the column should be mea- sured and proportioned to his form" (Alberti, De re aedificatoria). 13.
