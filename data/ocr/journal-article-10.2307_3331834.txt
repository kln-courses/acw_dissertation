<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art and the Public HENRY P. RALEIGH In the last quarter of the 18th century Denis Diderot railed against the duplicity of art dealers and collectors, the proliferation of amateurism, and the vulgarization of popular taste. Like other Enlightenment minds, Diderot was interested in improving the status and the cultural level of le peuple. The problem he struggled with was how to popu- larize art without sacrificing its inherent quality, a dilemma that would persist for another several hundred years. Diderot lived in the waning days of Rococo art and the dwindling days of the elitist aristocracy that had bred it. Emerging to replace both was an art and a social system purportedly for the people. Neoclassicism was all at once demo- cratic, autocratic, pedagogical and lasciviously moral. Diderot faced up to the practical difficulty of his ideal and concluded, unhappily, that "taste is a matter of caprice"; the preferences of le peuple in art were at best unpredictable and at worst predictable of the least desirable attributes of art. Someone must act as guide and setter of exemplars for popular taste. As Diderot saw it, the function of the art critic was interpretive and instructive. Technical matters were best known to the artist, but ideas, the meaning of art, fell to the wisdom of the critic who, in turn, would educate the public. Diderot wrote for the French Salon exhibitions - among the first of the public showings of art in Western cultural history. Le peuple perhaps did require knowledgeable interpretations of art and thus was conceived the profession of the art critic, in terms hardly different from today's definition. HENRY P. RALEIGH is professor of film history and art criticism at the State Uni- versity of New York - New Paltz.

RALEIGH Not quite a century later a singular event occurred which, for that moment at least, moved art out of the critic's domain and squarely into the critical arena of the public-at-large. In 1863, Louis Bonaparte dramatically responded to the growing criticism of the conduct, espe- cially the politics of jurying, that surrounded the official Salon exhibi- tions. The scandal of the Salon of 1863 served as the crisis point and the emperor ordered a simultaneous exhibit of all those artists' works that had been rejected from the official showing. To deal with the furor over the rejections he decided to let the public itself judge the validity of the complaints. The Salon des Refuses did not actually fulfill Bonaparte's purpose--many good artists withdrew from the second Salon for fear of being associated with artistic riffraff. But as many remained to exhibit and take whatever lumps or laurels might come their way. Manet's Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe was subjected to particular ridicule. Whistler's The White Girl, on the other hand, re- ceived a critical recognition it had not enjoyed when shown previously in London. The raucous, scornful behavior of the public in their newly found role of judge was described by Zola in his novel, L'Oeuvre. The novice critics discovered that art was of unsurpassed entertainment, a revelation that became entrenched in public attitude. Maurice Denis, painter and writer, would speak scathingly of a public ever greedy for novelty. Whatever the public wanted the artist had to satisfy in some measure. If he was to survive it seemed necessary to place his works before the audience. In addition to the Salon exhibitions of both official and un- official art, artists quickly saw the advantage of arranging their own one-man shows in order to attract the fickle public. Courbet did so in 1855, Manet in 1867. The gallery system had begun. More significantly, an unprecedented relationship between the artist and his new patrons was instituted. This relationship, since first arous- ing Diderot's suspicions, has continued to be viewed unkindly by a suc- cession of commentators, some of considerable importance and influ- ence. Harold Rosenberg, for example, in Art on the Edge, suggests that it is with the Salon des Refuses of 1863 that the aesthetic position of the art object, after having reached a peak in humanistic regard, begins to fall into decline. The rank of the art object plummets to a position where it is equal to the value plane of commonplace things: "... a rejected art exists on the same metaphysical level of ordinary objects, if not a lower one."' The denial of transcendence to the art object is turned into the desired condition of moder art, the exclusive modus operandi of the</page><page sequence="3">ART AND THE PUBLIC 51 avant-garde. Only public ridicule and rejection of his objects will adequately nourish the avant-gardist and assure him of the success of his efforts. It matters little what is rejected so long as original in the respect that it has never before been denounced. In the act of denunci- ation the artist and public are joined as strange bedfellows - a partnership formed with some initial reluctance and resentments. Salvador Dali was severely scored by his Surrealist comrades for his bla- tant social climbing and publicity mongering. Soon, however, all artists learned the merits of publicity, particularly of the sensational kind. Rosenberg again comments: "The twentieth century has taught the practical and spiritual urgency of social recognition. To fail to exist publicly is hardly to exist at all."2 The artist must be in the public eye and mind, much as a movie star, interesting and newsworthy. And the art object, like the film, may take second place to the artist - the medium serving instead as the vehicle which presents and portrays a personality. The public's ritual denunciations of artistic oddities are conveniently arranged by the art museums which have become less depositories of old aesthetic treasures and more the stage on which the public may officially perform its obligatory part in the drama of con- temporary art. The standards for such showmanship have been set by several well-known art institutions, notably New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. If hustling modern art to the public has been the central occupation of the publicly supported museums of fine art, promoting the goods to be hustled has fallen the lot of the arts funding agencies. The Na- tional Endowment for the Arts and state arts councils have deserving reputations for encouraging experimentation in art media and urging public confrontations with the results. Performing a similar although oblique service, and so obvious that they are taken for granted, are the art programs that flourish in nearly every public elementary and sec- ondary school and university system in the country. Public funds pay both for future art practitioners and audiences. Since the 18th century the public's embrace of the arts has consider- ably increased in scope and strength of grip. Only a complete elitist would deny society any sort of touch with the high arts. Still, very few have been cheered by the union. One notable exception has been Sir Herbert Read who did make every effort to see something beneficial in a marriage of art and the public. Like many classic thinkers who had spoken of art in social, pedagogical terms, Sir Herbert, the champion of early moder art, confessed readily to a similar stand, believing that society is dependent upon art as a "binding, fusing and energizing</page><page sequence="4">52 HENRY P. RALEIGH force." Sir Herbert held to strong sociological-political views which permeated his speculations on the state of art and culture in his time. He saw in the emerging forms of modernism much promise of a social renewal and salvation. He found extraordinary relationships between the formalism of Cubist concepts of art and the Jungian aspects of the Surrealist movement prior to World War II. Reviving Clive Bell's older and less satisfying notion of "significant form," Read defined art as the container of "symbols of the unconscious," archetypical forms in the abstract, capable of uniting society to its collective psyche. Read was soon to be disappointed, first in the direction taken by the new art and next by the society it was intended for. Despairing quickly of artists' willingness or ability to accept responsibility for serving society, Read disapproved of the selfish excesses of expressionism. He turned to public education as the most suitable and perhaps the only viable system for promoting the social goods of art. Art education was to take up the challenge and through its labors bring about the victorious revolution in social sensibilities. In all of this Read hoped to demolish the aristocratic myth of the art object and its aloof, supporting institu- tions, a nagging hangover of the outmoded, self-indulgent traditions of an old art: "... a defunct art, perpetuated by defunct institutions."3 Yet something had to replace these and what it would be was not an easy matter for it involved the "complete social reorientation towards art." Social epochs, like individual artists, can be aesthetically inspired. Read called for the investigative resources of psychology, of social his- torians, and of educationists to provide the kinds of information needed to secure "a perfect equilibrium of the sensuous and intellectual facul- ties...."4 These indeed were the requirements of a truly creative age of people. Everyone should paint a picture, compose a poem. Did not T. S. Eliot write a great poem in his spare time? In this society of artists some will be specialists, useful ones like industrial designers and architects. All will be artist/citizens enjoying the liberation of the deeper senses. These powerful projections of Sir Herbert were never to come true. Somehow society had soured along with its educational systems. Those educational reforms he once advocated met with defeat. Writing in Art and Alienation, his last collection of essays, Read stated that these had "not [been] sufficiently realized by many of my fellow workers in this field."5 In short, socialism appeared a failure; the ideologies of society compromised art and neglected to respect its autonomy. The revolution of modem art ended in exhaustion and it was caught within</page><page sequence="5">ART AND THE PUBLIC 53 the restricting, sterile bounds of "technological rationality," absorbing rather than revolting against the numbing values given in the social ideologies. Read's interest in the moral preachments and predictions of Herbert Marcuse is not surprising. Although their historical alternatives were widely at variance, both saw that a humanism grounded in technologi- cal ideals leads to certain cultural abortions. For Read, the civilization contemporary to him was "visually chaotic." Nowhere could be found "a style of art that springs spontaneously from the basic social and eco- nomic realities of our way of life."6 Marcuse too speaks of the "obscene merger of aesthetics and reality." He believed the art of the past was produced as the consequence of alienation, objects created to conceal the "defeated possibilities, the hopes unfulfilled and the promises be- trayed." This separate, antagonistic function of art is inexorably dimin- ished in industrial societies. Art becomes grossly distorted as it struggles to retrieve a bare semblance of privacy and estrangement in a society whose networks of technological communications quickly ingest and regurgitate the works of artists to the public. Cultural forms, past and present, are mediated to the masses and are therefore devalued, altered in original form by the processes of reproduction necessary to spread them over ever-widening cultural areas. Read could not really accept Marcuse's argument in its entirety but with an amount of bitter relish he does quote Marcuse's description of modem social aesthetics: "The developing technological reality is undermining not only the traditional forms but the very basis of the artistic alienation - that is, it tends to invalidate not only certain 'styles' but also the very substance of art."7 The ideals of a technological society are realized in a "peaceful exis- tence" where there are no problems, no unsatisfied needs. Where proper alienation cannot occur naturally it must be artificially induced - such is the role of the modem avant-garde. Even this becomes increasingly difficult in a world where few human activities can remain hidden from the media of communications. After centuries of aesthetic evolution, western civilization has brought art up to the level of a normative value. Along with freedom and the pursuit of happiness, art is and should be a good for everyone. It is the universal subscription to this value standing that permits and en- courages a publicly supported art. It has led at the same time to a curious democratization of the arts, a demand for easy access to art that, to many observers, reduces and corrupts creative originality. Susan Sontag, writing in The New York Times, sums it up: "That</page><page sequence="6">54 HENRY P. RALEIGH the modernist sensibility had created new boundaries for popular cul- ture and was eventually incorporated into it - this is a fact that no- body who has cared for culture can ignore or should fail to treat with high seriousness."8 Denis Diderot may have had something to worry about. The apathy of the fine arts today, the dearth of innovation, the enfeebled repeti- tions of its former glories - is all of this the inevitable consequence of art having been infected by the standardized mediocrity and the law of averaging that critics claim characterizes the mass of society? Specu- lation over the demise of art is not uncommon today. One of the themes of the Seventh International Congress of Aesthetics in 1972 was "Contemporary Art: Death of Art?." The revivalist trend in the fine arts of the '70s often seems composed of small paeans to a tradi- tion perhaps ended. But the question of art's end can be too easily and too quickly asked. The value status of art is generic and not the special attribute of a single painting or sculpture. Other objects, other forms may serve the value function as well. Those who lament over the declines inflicted on art by the intrusions of society have in mind certain forms of the arts, even certain styles within these forms. It may certainly be that, just as an older artistic style cedes to a new one because it is no longer expressively adequate, so an entire form of art may similarly suffer. The conditions that produce these fates are exceedingly complex, still tangible because the history of the arts is filled with forms that declined in artistic and social usefulness. The height of official academic art, an approved public art, had been reached by the 1860s. Under the attacks and ideological advances of early modernism, it rapidly lost its en- trenched social, political, and aesthetic advantages. Academic art, like its predecessors, was a narrative art supreme. From its inception moder art was vehemently antinarrative, soon to become literally incompre- hensible except to the initiated. In short time, artists and critics were to speak of another Academy. It appeared that the moder "Art Establishment," although more loosely organized than its 19th-century counterpart, was just as doctrinaire. The point in time at which the destinies of academic art and mod- ernism were to collide signaled the first experiments in a new visual form that was as naturally given to realism and narration as moder art was naturally opposed. By the 1890s, when the historic position of modem art was assured, the narrative role of cinema had been clearly</page><page sequence="7">ART AND THE PUBLIC 55 and irrevocably established. Film could have gone in other directions; it did not, probably because of its public origins. It was conceived as a simple storytelling art and remained so. In the beginning the stories were told only to the lowest and least consequential of the social audi- ence. Crude in technique and dramatic conception, equally crude in its emotional evocations, film was, quite by intention, the most vulgar form of public entertainment. These first habitual viewers of film were made up of the illiterate, the unemployed, drunks and that shadowy class of people who, having no honest afternoon occupations, fre- quented the nickelodeons. In the United States such mongrel assortments of film lovers were fleshed out by goodly numbers of immigrants to the large cities. Neither education nor language were a barrier to sitting transfixed before fifteen minutes or less of absurdly naive but nonetheless encouraging silent morality repeated over and over throughout the day. The rich were bad and, unless abjectly penitent, normally lost all their wealth or went straight to hell. Unmarried sex was not only unpleasant but eventually led to insanity for the lucky ones and death for the less fortunate. It was a near guarantee that poverty and virtue, if enjoyed together, would be rewarded by happiness. It is difficult to imagine that a better educated middle and upper class would find any attrac- tion in these brief and primitive film episodes so divorced from every level of social reality. Indeed, after the first flush of interest in the novelty of moving images, the largest part of the audience returned to vaudeville and "legitimate" theater. After all, the viewing of film then was somewhat painful due to the gross flickering of the projected light and was thought to be physically damaging. But by the end of World War I film was well on its way to becoming the primary middle class entertainment and art form. How did this happen? Not because film grew to mature sophistication. It simply grew in length-the "feature" - and became more expertly pieced together by masters like D. W. Griffith and finally, to complete the winning over of the middle class, was housed in elegant film theaters in the better neigh- borhoods. Film, now over eighty years old, never entirely completed its child- hood for it is still essentially a simple storytelling art, no more compli- cated, no less interesting, as easily comprehended as Homer's Ulysses or L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz. The evolution of film, remark- ably swift compared to any other of the visual arts, is overwhelmingly that of technique. Film's development is little marked by radical</page><page sequence="8">56 HENRY P. RALEIGH changes in concepts or aesthetics. What made D. W. Griffith the great director of his time was surely not sophistication or the insight of his filmic messages or symbolism. Griffith was as much, if not more, a purple dramatist as any of his era. His gifts lay in the application of technical innovations, the ability to convert slow-moving sentiment or blunt, trite actions to a fast-paced, vastly more exciting visual and narrative experience. Even with the introduction of sound and the possibility of a literal- ness and a naturalism not permitted the silents, little of a revolutionary nature occurred in film save, again, an increase in the illusion of reality and a greater range and dimension of its entertainment appeal. The basic themes of sex (love) and violence (adventure) remained as be- fore. Where the history of American film has been accompanied by censorship restraints of such thematic material, European film has been marked by powerful governmental interests and controls. The existence of both these factors is testimony to the "public" nature of film, as vulgar now, as socially influential as at its birth. Only an art of the people would attract such a strong degree of politi- cal, religious and secular restrictions. As quickly as the small store-front theaters sprang up, the news media and concerned church and civic groups launched their campaigns against the immoral effects of film on the youth of the nation. Public-spirited agencies, such as the Gen- eral Federations of Women's Clubs, the Lord's Day Alliance, and the New York Christian Endeavor, heaped clamorous abuse upon the base- ness and vileness of films as a whole, the Hollywood film studios, and actors and actresses specifically. The attacks met with a measure of success and eventually there was drawn up, without legal basis, the infamous Production Code, an extensive list of restrictions and pro- hibitions on film content, dialogue, themes, and visual situations. Among numerous other forbidden displays, the Production Code out- lawed the depiction of drugs, excessive drinking, and the photograph- ing of an unwed couple anywhere within camera view of a double bed. The Code neatly incorporated an assumption regarding the in- dissolvable union of public to art and wrote it into its own justifications. One of these is ample evidence of the uncommon relationship of film to society: "This art appeals at once to every class; this art reaches places unpenetrated by other forms of art." Since Plato expelled the artist from his Republic, no society has been so protected from damage by its own art form. So closely has the public and the film been identified with each other that for most of this art's</page><page sequence="9">ART AND THE PUBLIC 57 history, a short one to be sure, it has barely ranked as an art at all. Only with the rise of auteur theory has film begun to be seriously con- sidered a high art form - this perhaps because la politique des auteurs better fits our traditional belief in the one-artist, one-masterpiece con- cept. As distinguished a critic as Dwight MacDonald held firmly to the opinion that film was a second-class art due to its dependence on the tasteless masses. Gilbert Seldes, in the Introduction to his book The Great Audience, retracts a prediction he had made twenty-five years earlier, in 1925. He had then prophesied that popular entertain- ment, including film, would some day "be accepted and criticized on the same basis as the fine arts."9 Society was once more to disappoint; to the makers and consumers of the mass entertainments the idea of "the work of art as an imperishable object is totally foreign."'0 The argument offered by Seldes and others, that film, after all, is aimed at capturing the fifteen to twenty-one year old audience and its attraction drops off sharply at the older age groups, might have held in the post-World War II years when attendance at films fell severely in a losing competition with television. These critics had not reckoned on the rise of the European and American film enthusiasts who saw the film as a genuine art, unique to the 20th century and more, an art whose history was brief enough to make possible the observation of its deliverance and formation. The numbers of admissions to contemporary film are considerably less than the peak of one-hundred million weekly in 1946, but add to the current figure of somewhere around twenty million a week the uncountable numbers of university students and leisure-time film fanatics who regularly view the historic course of the film from samplings of its fairly short career. Add also the millions who watch television reruns of films and the audience for film may likely exceed that of every other form of art. In any of the arts such historic reviews, systematic or random, are taken for granted and automatically count in the total audience of admirers, critics, and appreciators of the art. The economics of film, the need to better-than-break even, may ap- pear to tie the medium forevermore to the tastes and purses of the public. Auteur theory notwithstanding, film is singularly an art made possible only by a large number of creative and technical minds. In a great many respects film is a group art, by a group and for one, even to its involvement with basic and recurring themes of popular culture. Its symbols are, and must be, those in cultural currency. No matter how shallow or profound, obvious or subtle the symbols of film, all are</page><page sequence="10">58 HENRY P. RALEIGH perceived in the context of realism that is peculiar to film. That curious sense of "now," the illusion that the filmic events are ever occurring in the viewer's own time, gives to the moving images and symbols of film a quality of life and immediacy that is possessed by few arts. This inexorable realism of the film is the tie that binds the audience to the form in a rather symbiotic relationship. Film has counted on an audience maturation at least equal to its own growth in technical ad- vances. Frequently the audience is underestimated by the filmmakers but this has been more the case in the past. Film, despite its commer- cial cautions, has, for the most part, opted to move with and often slightly ahead of the audience and has had to do so to stay competi- tively alive. One of the noteworthy aspects of the history of film is the appear- ance of sudden jumps in the movement of filmic art, most often asso- ciated with specific nations and at specific points in time. In a socio- logical analysis of this phenomenon, George H. Huaco suggested that certain cultural conditions must be present, their occurrence providing the most encouraging environment for leaps in film evolution. One of these is of special interest since it is so peculiar to the social orientation of film: "... a climate of political norms... favorable or tolerant."'l The British filmmaker Thorold Dickinson adds one other condition to Huaco's outline: "The capacity of a sufficient audience to appreciate the results."12 The swift developmental history of film does show that such an audience, in sufficient numbers and sufficiently appreciative, was there to support this art. Certainly, the history of film would have quickly ended had there not been wide public backing. A comparable position, vis-a-vis the public, has seldom been known in the arts of western culture. For the visual arts the closest approxi- mation may have been that period in painting and sculpture when there were conjoined a credible narrative symbolism with an accom- modating visual documentation. Renaissance art knew a general audi- ence who understood the art as a kind of anthropomorphic communi- cation of their social values and beliefs. It enjoyed as well an elite, educated, and aristocratic audience who aesthetically understood and patronized these forms of art. Film knows also a critical, sympathetic elite and its general audience is undoubtedly far greater, more inclusive internationally, than was the public for the iconographic arts of the Renaissance. It is possible that an art that either willfully or inadvertently removes itself from the</page><page sequence="11">ART AND THE PUBLIC 59 predominant social value systems and becomes incapable of absorbing the feelings and meaning of its own time will, sooner or later, have little to nourish its creative appetite. It will, in effect, devour its own being. Perhaps this may be the fate of contemporary visual art, thus completing the course and prophecy of the art-for-art's sake movement that ushered in twentieth-century aesthetics. In contrast, it may be argued that film, in addition to drawing from the richness and infinity of the symbolic variations incorporated in common folk themes- as real and as varied as the society of people that generates them- manifestly benefits from a technological com- plexity that assures it of the formal capacity and potential to accommo- date these infinite varieties of personal and public expressions. And, remarkably, these expressions are given shape in the visual and tem- poral modes that the social components most easily comprehend and assimilate. This extraordinary and powerful relationship of an art to a people, despite the admonitions that have passed onward from the 18th century, may well be the condition that once, long ago, prevailed in all social arts and is the ingredient that yet remains in our humanistic, normative value definition of the arts. As old as film itself is the criticism that it fails in portraying a true and meaningful version of reality and propagates instead a misleading, immature, even dangerous mythology. Social realist criticism would see the film as primarily a political, pedagogical vehicle - a medium that calls to action rather than passively entertaining. But film in this mode has never proved of popular success and the great audience seems still to be most drawn to the myth perpetuating films, the forms that offer up the illusions of brief superiority in love, in battle, in supraordinary affairs of life. If this is a failure, it is the failure of the best moments of any of our visual arts - those marvelous times when they have de- picted a kind of mythological perfection, deliberate abstractions away from gross reality. The French critic, Andre Bazin, has defined film as an art which enters into the "reconstruction of a mythic reality." This appears to include those features of film which render it popu- larly enthralling at the same time it is perceived as a slice out of the real world. All myths are a lie in the sense that they make no attempt to duplicate reality and serve rather, to borrow from the arguments advanced by Levi-Strauss, as a force that mediates between the real and the hoped-for. The meanings of human myths are found in their structures, not their contents. Some small gratitude might be extended</page><page sequence="12">60 HENRY P. RALEIGH to film for there is little in contemporary culture that is willing and capable of transmitting the myths of peoples so swiftly, so entertainingly, and with such technical proficiency.
