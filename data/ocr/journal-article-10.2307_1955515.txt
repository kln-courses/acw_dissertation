<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judicial Biography and the Behavioral Persuasion J. WOODFORD HOWARD, JR. Johns Hopkins University The task of this paper is to appraise the rela- tionship between judicial biography and re- search in judicial behavior. Interest in this sub- ject suggests that fashions come and go in more places than hemlines. A generation ago, an APSA symposium on judicial biography de- bated the problems of the genre exclusively in terms of legal, historical, and literary analysis.' No reference was made to the social sciences, nor was any defense thought necessary for their absence. Meantime, the rise of the behavioral persuasion has produced profound changes in the study of judicial processes,2 while signifi- cant judicial biographies have continued to be produced.3 A reassessment of judicial biogra- phy as a research technique is in order in light of these developments.4 I "The Writing of Judicial Biography-A Sympo- sium," Indiana Law Journal, 24 (1948), 363-400. The stimulus for this paper was the 1969 APSA panel in honor of Alpheus T. Mason and Carl B. Swisher- pre-eminent judicial biographers among political sci- entists. I wish to acknowledge my debt to both and expressly to include my own work in the following criticism of biographies. 2 See, e.g., Glendon Schubert (ed.), Judicial Be- havior (Chicago: Rand McNally &amp; Co., 1964); sym- posium, "Social Science Approaches to the Judicial Process," Harvard Law Review, 79 (1966), 1551-1628; and Joel B. Grossman and Joseph Tanenhaus (eds.), Frontiers of Judicial Research (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1969). 'See, e.g., Alpheus T. Mason, Harlan Fiske Stone: Pillar of the Law (New York: Viking Press, 1956). The biographical medium apparently has declined in popularity among younger political scientists. Peltason found that from 1951-54 more than one-fourth of political science doctoral dissertations completed in public law were biographical in character. From 1957- 64, the figure for biographical dissertations in progress was 14 out of 70 or one-fifth. The 1967-69 in-progress figure was 10 out of 109 or less than one-tenth. See Jack W. Peltason, "Supreme Court Biography and the Study of Public Law," in Gottfried Dietze (ed.), Essays on the American Constitution (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall Publishers, Inc., 1964), p. 215; American Political Science Review, 61 (1967), p. 849; P.S., 1 (Summer, 1968), p. 46; and P.S., 2 (Summer, 1969), p. 433. 4For a wider appraisal, see Lewis J. Edinger, "Po- litical Science and Political Biography," Journal of Politics, 26 (1964), pp. 423, 628. Students of political leadership apparently doubt the relevance of judicial biographies. Edinger excludes them from the fine bibli- ography in his Political Leadership in Industrialized Societies (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1967), pp. 348-66. Another recent bibliography omits biog- raphy altogether. "Theory and Research in the Study of Political Leadership: An Annotated Bibliography" (Public Affairs Research Bureau, Southern Illinois University, 1969). This appraisal of the relationship between ju- dicial biography and judicial behavior research will proceed in two ways: (1) conceptually, by comparing the two as modes of inquiry; and (2) empirically, by making an inventory of the behavioral content of 15 leading judicial biog- raphies. Although the accent is on biography, the central theme is that judicial biographies and judicial behavior research are complemen- tary. Conceptually, they have important com- mon premises and problems as well as major differences. Empirically, judicial biographies also offer considerable insight into judicial be- havior. If closely read, they yield a substantial number of hypotheses worthy of empirical in- vestigation and validation. When viewed as case studies in judicial politics, judicial biogra- phies thus become closely related to behavioral inquiry. And their strengths and weaknesses fall into place as reflecting properties generally associated with case study as a mode of politi- cal analysis. For clarity it is necessary to specify what is meant by the terms "judicial biography" and "behavioral research." So many studies of indi- vidual jurists have been written with such dif- ferent purposes, credentials, and sources that I have narrowed the field for comparison.5 By "judicial biography" I mean a life-study of a judge written substantially as a case-history in the judicial process. While different balances may be struck between the classic biographical goals of portraying character and career, the prime object is to describe and relate the judge's personality, background, and belief sys- 5 Useful lists and typologies of judicial biographies may be found in Robert M.

Pelta- son, "Supreme Court Biography and the Study of Public Law," in Gottfried Dietze, loc. cit.; and Alan Westin, Book Review, Yale Law Journal, 66 (1957), 462. This analysis excludes works that are not book-length. Shorter, but often high-quality biographi- cal studies of jurists may be found in the Dictionary of American Biography; the International Encyclo- pedia of the Social Sciences; "Studies in Judicial Biography," Vanderbilt Law, Review, vol. 10 (1957) and vol. 18 (1965); Allison Dunham and Philip B.

A search of the literature tempts one to invoke Plato via Mr. Justice Stewart: behavioralism like pornog- raphy is immanent; we cannot define it but know it when we see it.7 Given the youth and diversity of the movement, and in order not to restrict inquiry to the moods or methods of the moment, it seems preferable to deal with the "behavioral persuasion," an orientation to the empirical study of politics which may be identi- fied by four attributes: (1) The unit of analysis is the behavior of persons (whether individuals, group, or system) rather than of institutions. (2) The search is for regularities in the deter- minants of political behavior. (3) The goal is systematic, explanatory theory rather than de- scription of discrete or historically specific events. (4) Quantitative methods are preferred as more reliable, replicable, and valid expres- sions of empirical propositions about politics than other methods, assuming that all methods rest upon simplifying assumptions and manipu- lation of data.8 I. Judicial Biography and Behavioral Research Compared Several similarities and differences emerge when judicial biography and behavioral re- search are compared as analytical approaches. The first similarity, seldom discussed, is that they both commonly rest on inarticulated epis- temology. Although the problem is too intricate for elaborate discussion, unconscious assump- 6 This conception of biography has the disadvantage of excluding several types of biographical works- encomia, philosophic studies, and character studies- which collectively comprise the lion's share of a vo- luminous literature, especially about Supreme Court justices. But it highlights the one common denominator of the leading biographies: each illuminates relation- ships among a personality (independent variable), his court or institution (intervening variable), and his polity (dependent variable). Younger students may be surprised to learn that lawyer John P. Frank, using different nomenclature, called those relationships the only justification for writing judicial biography back in 1948. "The Writing of Judicial Biography . op. cit., pp. 374-75. TJacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964). 8 The discussion draws heavily from Heinz Eulau, The Behavioral Persuasion in Politics (New York: Random House, Inc., 1963); Robert A. Dahl, "The Behavioral Approach in Political Science," American Political Science Review, 55 (1961), p. 763; Neil J. Smelser, Essays in Sociological Explanation (Engle- wood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall Publishers, Inc., 1968); James C. Charlesworth (ed.), Contemporary Political Analysis (New York: The Free Press, 1967); and David Truman, "The Impact on Political Science of the Revolution in the Behavioral Sciences," in Eulau (ed.), Behavioralism in Political Science (1969), p. 38. tions about the nature of observation are treacherous pitfalls for the unwary. Is there an "'objective" history which can be reconstructed as it happened, or is history merely a selective rendering of the past through the lens of the present? Is there an objective reality or imma- nent corpus of facts to be discovered, or is em- pirical validation merely the congruence of two conceptual frameworks-our common-sense perceptions of everyday reality and a set of hy- potheses to be tested? What is the scope of in- tersubjective meaning among researchers and researched? While one might expect behavioralists to be more rigorous about these matters than judicial biographers, only the most careful scholars of either persuasion emphasize the relativity of observation-a relativity which led to Vol- taire's remark that history is the tricks the liv- ing play on the dead. Leaders, to be sure, are usually less guilty than their followers. Alpheus T. Mason, for example, while zestfully attack- ing Justice Sutherland for unawareness of per- sonal biases, perennially shakes his seminar with the theorem: "facts never speak for them- selves; facts are ordered by theory." Carl B. Swisher, in my opinion, was sensitive to obser- vational dilemmas when he insisted that the general reveals itself through particular illustra- tions. Yet, for most of us, recognizing first premises is largely implicit, often for the other fellow, and seldom done with the candor of Cardozo, who conceded the "inescapable rela- tion between the truth without us and the truth within."9 Actually, few students of judicial af- fairs deserve any medals for self-conscious grappling with the philosophy of history or sci- ence as it affects their subject. Second, both judicial biographers and judi- cial behavioralists share common problems of value-laden selectivity regarding questions asked, choice and classification of variables from indeterminate numbers, criteria of rele- vance, and interpretation. Judicial biographers have been criticized by Peltason and others for indulging in personality cults, for choosing sub- jects and evidence according to subjective and nonverifiable assumptions of interest, impor- tance, and personal empathy.'0 The results, like other forms of case study, have been unrepre- sentative and unreplicable biographical cover- age, along with tensions over standards of rele- vance best exemplified by lawyers' criticism of Mason's Brandeis for inadequate attention to 'Carl B.

Tompkins, political scientists' criticism of King's Fuller for ignoring such landmarks of judicial legislation as the Svigar Trust Case, and Fairman's criticism of nearly everybody for ne- glecting briefs." Much of this criticism is justified, but not the implication that the behavioral persuasion of- fers an escape from parallel problems of selec- tivity. One vexing example is the issue whether votes or opinions are superior measures of judi- cial power. Justice Jackson once asserted that Supreme Court opinions explaining decisions are more important than case results. Students of doctrinal development readily accept that proposition, though the reverse may be true of politicians and mass publics. The quantitative impetus, on the other hand, appears to have boxed some interpreters into the conclusion that all that counts are votes. Clearly both votes and opinions can be measures of influence, both may be expressed in quantitative or quali- tative terms, and neither can precisely measure personal attitudes on collegial courts for the simple reason that both votes and opinions are subject to group influences.12 Similarly, the degree to which our inferences are biased by method is an issue infrequently faced. Strikingly diverse images of jurists emerge from the varying analytical frameworks used in judicial research.13 They range from the judges trapped in their logic and virtue of 19th- century memoirs to the judges seemingly trapped in their ideologies of 20th-century be- havioral studies; from the rational poker-players of economic or gaming models to the hardy indi- vidualists of conventional biographies in which discrete personal and situational factors domi- nate choice. Which image is a closer fit to ac- tual behavior? One must posit a conceptual framework of reality, also selected a priori and usually following some biological, economic, or theatrical metaphor before making measure- ments, quantitative or otherwise. Accordingly, both biographers and behavioralists. usually presume rational models of the judicial process. A third and critical common characteristic is the choice of single individuals as the focal point of analysis. Judicial behavior research is 11304 U.S. 64 (1938); U.S. v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1 (1895). Charles Fairman in "The Writing of Judicial Biography . . . ," op. cit., p. 365. 12 Cf. my "On the Fluidity of Judicial Choice," American Political Science Review, 62 (1968), p. 43, and Glendon Schubert, "The Dimensions of Deci- sional Response," in Grossman and Tanenhaus, op. cit., p. 163. 13 Louis S. Loeb, "Judicial Behavior: Themes and Variations," Public Administration Review, 26 (1966), p. 126. not limited to this focus, of course; but some judicial voting bloc and most attitudinal ana- lysts use that focus as a starting point, and few scholars reject the assumption that individual jurists make value choices affecting public pol- icy. While that assumption is surely plausible even at political-system levels, it is important to recognize some of the conceptual implications of the single-actor focus. For one thing, it goes against the grain of most contemporary social science. Collective rather than individual be- havior so dominates the inquiry of modern his- torians and behavioral scientists that personal- ity is either assumed away or forms residual categories. Champions of the "human element" and leadership study have made little headway in any social science. Not even psychology uses the individual focal point in the same fashion as judicial biography or jurimetrics. Psycholo- gists are primarily concerned with the influence of external events on the whole personality rather than the influence of aspects of personal- ity on political events-a difference which warns against uncritical borrowing from that quarter.'4 Hence, by focusing on the causal chain of person-&gt;policy, both judicial biogra- phers and attitudinal behavioralists occupy the same unpopular boat. Further, those who inject process into the equation (person-&gt;process --policy) are asking extremely ambitious ques- tions requiring causal explanation at three lev- els-individual, group, system. Institutionalists, aggregationists, and systems analysts hold con- stant at least one of those. Psychologists cut their risks by controlling the collective behavior affecting individuals. For all their mutual com- plaints about the deficiencies of the other's cau- sal inferences, the tension between judicial biographers and attitudinal behavioralists is not so much over frames of reference as over dif- ferent degrees of formalization and methods of establishing causal links. Both conceptualize the source of decision as internal to individual ac- tors. A particular manifestation of focal-point kinship is the location of biographers in con- flicts that have accompanied the behavioral em- phasis in judicial research. One element of ten- sion rises from group versus individual focus. Put crudely, advocates of the group-struggle approach, such as Peltason or Truman, are concerned with power flows and demands upon decision-makers (inputs) leading to public pol- icy (outcomes) in continuing processes of con- 14Eulau, Behavioral Persuasion, pp. 85 ff; Smelser, op. cit., pp. 39-41, 100 ff.

Greenstein, Personality and Politics (Chicago: Markham Publishing Co., 1969).</page><page sequence="4">1971 Judicial Biography and the Behavioral Persuasion 707 flict resolution. Behavioralists such as Schubert plumb the attitudinal determinants of individual behavior in the conversion stage of systems analysis, leaving "in-depth" determinants to the undeveloped field of political psychology. Biog- raphers, with their loose talk about "personal philosophy" and "social forces," have a foot in each camp. Sharing the attitudinalist's individ- ual focus, they echo complaints that the group- struggle perspective subsumes individual varia- tions of perception, cognition, and intensity to the point that group generalizations often com- mit reductionist and anthropomorphic fallacies. Less explicitly, however, they also echo the criticism of attitudinalists for factoring out ex- ternal political demands and results to the point that the most important questions at the inter- face of law and politics are never asked. More interested in describing complexity than in sim- plifying theory, biographers commonly com- plain that both group and attitudinal analysts neglect a host of intervening, institutional, and interpersonal factors within collegial courts to the point that the explanatory power of either combat or stimulus-response models is over- stated. Thus they argue that the Supreme Court is not just another interest group or "black box," that different decisional processes in gov- ernment institutions produce different out- comes, that attitude no more determines behav- ior than behavior confirms attitude. Contrary assumptions are dismissed all too often as over- reactions by methodologues against the exces- sive formalism of the past-a case of throwing law-court babies out with the bath-rather than what they commonly are: simplifying assump- tions taken for data control and theoretical rigor. Whatever one's view of these tensions, it is evident that part of the debate over behavioral- ism among students of judicial affairs are con- flicts over levels of analysis. As such they are merely a judicial variant of a larger problem common to all social science explanation. The micro-macro issue is a recurring one, perhaps more difficult than the overdrawn institution- behavior dichotomy of earlier debates over be- havioralism, because we cannot talk about ev- erything at once and because observers, being human, tend to exaggerate the relevance of their subject and convert different focal-point choices into different wave lengths. The afflic- tion, while normal, is not irremediable. The therapy is recognition that description and ex- planation must proceed at both individual and collective levels, that the relevance of personal, social, or cultural factors varies with the level of explanation sought, and that we are not dealing with a parochial problem but one which cuts across other social sciences, includ- ing history, on whose experience we can draw.'5 So far we have argued that most biographers and behavioralists share common adversities of epistemology, selectivity, and units of analysis. A fourth similarity is a common bundle of legal realist premises that men instead of rules decide cases and that one determinant of judicial choice is personal values. The volitional aspect of judging has affected nearly every major school of American jurisprudence since Jus- tice Holmes made these assumptions re- spectable. Without them neither judicial biogra- phy nor behavioralism makes much sense. Some- times forgotten, however, are the subtle effects of realist assumptions on the concepts of law and policy-making. The definition of law as what judges do, as Schubert points out, changes law from an immanent to a behavioral concept.16 Law is judicial behavior. Further if we con- centrate on how and why instead of what ques- tions, the concept of law shifts from an output to a never-ending process. An astute reader of our literature recently remarked that he gath- ered the impression that judges were forever deciding but that nothing was ever decided. A behavioral concept of law virtually obliterates the distinction between what law is and how it is made.17 That is why biographies such as Ma- son's Stone were controversial even among le- gal realists, and for reasons other than the com- plaints about invasions of privacy which have accompanied life-histories since Plutarch. Modern judicial biographers concentrate in- creasingly on how and why questions and less on character, legal content, and ethical valida- tion-the who, what, and for what questions which scholars past and lawyers present regard as legitimate parts of the biographical task.18 In blunter words, judicial biographies are ba- sically case studies in judical politics. Their au- thors are essentially empiricists, describing and 15 Eulau, op. cit., pp. 89, 122; Smelser, op. cit., pp. 40, 100 ff; and M.

In terms of the four attributes of the behavioral persuasion described above, ju- dicial biography and behavioral research are united on the first criterion of analytical unit. Less explicitly, however, biographical descrip- tion often includes group and institutional struggle, a shift of gears reconciled with the single-actor focus by rather vague explanations that judges internalize and thereby represent the outlooks of various interests and social groups. Group access, in other words, is indi- rect and personalized. The primary differences of approach among biographers and behavioralists thus lie with the other three attributes of the behavioral persua- sion-regularities, theory, and method. Gener- ally speaking, biographers do not search for regularities in judicial behavior. They often as- sume the most important uniformities, some- times with awkward results. For example, lead- ing biographers are ambivalent about whether judicial decisions are a composite of personal values. Their general propositions to that effect are soon qualified by assertions that some inter- vening variable, e.g., bargaining or "self-re- straint" by their judge, mediated between pol- icy values and action.19 Biographers, individual and collectively, have not really decided whether attitudes and behavior are proximate. The difference between their general and par- ticular propositions neatly illustrates what hap- pens to personal variations when explanation shifts from individual to collective behavior. Biographers, too, make simplifying assumptions about individuals in order to discuss groups. The third attribute-theoretical impulse- points to the key distinction. Despite judicial biography's heuristic potential, its animus is de- scription, not theory. No judicial biography rests upon an explicit, much less uniform theo- retical framework. Rarely do biographers ex- ploit their studies by way of suggesting theoret- ical refinements and implications. Seldom do they even compare their own findings with other biographers'. This difference between de- scribing how and explaining why, in my view, is far more important than current conflicts over the fourth count of method. While theory and method are closely entwined, it misplaces emphasis to make the dividing line means rather than ends. Since political science lacks a unique methodology, there is nothing inher- 9 Cf.

Field: Craftsman of the Law (Washington: The Brookings Institution, 1930), pp. 167, 239 versus p. 81; Mason, Stone, pp. 299, 425, 612, 733 versus pp. 232, 330, 350, 487, 630, 773. ently wrong with case studies or with borrow- ing from historians as opposed to other disci- plines. The real questions are the purposes of the borrowing and the explanatory yield. Just as few biographers have utilized descriptive statis- tics, so David J. Danelski and Walter F. Mur- phy have demonstrated the behavioral possibili- ties of historical data.20 It bears repetition that behavioralism and quantification are not co-ex- tensive. Choice of method turns on relative reli- ability and costs for the data and purposes at hand. The central differences between judicial biog- raphy and behavioral research thus boil down to this difference of emphasis: biographers are interested mainly in empirical description, be- havioralists in prediction and systematic expla- nation.21 Even this difference, however, is often one of degree. The best biographers have al- ways attempted to explain as well as describe- sometimes too much. The best behavioralists have always relied on trained intuition to avoid the trap of politically naive research. In any event, no problem of principle exists between theory and description. The two obvi- ously must go together. Since both biographers and behavioralists ask how and why questions, they share similar research problems. Both study the same universe of behavior as reflected in votes and opinions, and therefore select the same phenomena as dependent variables to be explained. Both tend to treat the same phenom- ena as distinctive causes and therefore tend to specify from an indeterminate number the same causal or independent variables. Both share realist assumptions as well as focal point and engage in the humbling procedure of mak- ing inferences from manifest collegial behavior about individual judicial minds. Both are com- monly denied the tools of survey sampling and controlled experiment, which support a techno- logical revolution in the social sciences, and must therefore improvise as best they can. While no one should minimize their method- ological differences, or the agonies of their sep- arate aspirations to art and science, it is plain that their differences are primarily the degree of theoretical explicitness, the weight given to certain intervening variables, and the means of 20 "The Influence of the Chief Justice in the Deci- sional Process," in Walter F.

In time, at least the latter differences may ap- pear less distinctive than what unites them. When perspectives clear over methodological issues we may find that individual-oriented be- havioral research has more in common with judicial biography than with aggregative forms of social science inquiry now seemingly united by similarities of method. Perhaps that was C. Herman Pritchett's meaning when he concluded that Carl Swisher, however he might have dis- liked the thought, "was one of the first . . . 'judicial behavioralists.' "22 Behavioralism, of course, involves more than unit of analysis. But, conceptually, judicial biography and judicial be- havior research have never been antithetical. By virtue of common subject matter and realist outlook, the one was a step to the other and a far greater departure from what had gone be- fore than now appears. Indeed, when the em- pirical content of judicial biographies is exam- ined from a behavioral perspective, biography and behavioral research relate not merely as historical continuities but also as complemen- tary techniques. HI. A Behavioral Inventory of Judicial Biography Complementary relations, like shotgun wed- dings, may please neither side of this affair. But in order to assess the behavioral potential of ju- dicial biography, I have made a crude inven- tory of behavioral propositions-or assertions easily translatable into them-contained in fif- teen leading judicial biographies. This proce- dure is not meant to suggest that a proposi- tional inventory can substitute for theory. An inventory, however, does make it possible to judge the empirical yield of judicial biographies from a common frame. The biographies cho- sen, though not exhaustive, are leading works picked mainly on grounds of availability. The behavioral propositions contained in them have been grouped into eight summary categories of behavioral research. Table 1 summarizes this inventory. The entries are the number of prop- ositions in each category found in each biogra- phy. Totals and averages are also reported, in- cluding total number of propositions per 100 pages.23 To clarify interpretation, it should be 22 "In Memoriam, Carl Brent Swisher," Villanova Law Review, 13 (1968), 708.

(Boston: Houghton- stressed that the table is based upon generous standards of what constitute behavioral propo- sitions. If the standard were insistence on crite- rion three-hypotheses derived from explicit theoretical frameworks-there would be no be- havioral propositions whatever. This I take to be evidence enough of disinterest in theory among biographers. If the standard were quan- tification, the total number would be small-27 in all and no more than 5 in any one work.24 The vast majority of propositions, in other words, have been translated into behavioral terms; hence, purists might prefer the label "be- havioral-like" propositions. To illustrate the procedure, Swisher's explanation of Taney's at- titudes and behavior in terms of Southern planter origins translates into a socialization hy- pothesis that social class background is a deter- minant of judicial attitudes and voting behav- ior, which can be tested for judges generally or for Taney alone by single-actor value analysis such as that which Schubert used for Justice Jackson.

Cause-effect propositions are included, moreover, regardless of how contradictory or empirically unverified they may seem. "Propositions" do not mean validated ones. Counterbalancing such generous standards is lack of repetition. Swisher in 1930 unequivo- cally stated the core of "political jurispru- dence": the Supreme Court is merely one among many power centers.26 The message did not change with repetition. Given the selectivity of the inventory, I do not pretend that it is anything more than one man's slicing of the cake. But taken for what it is, the inventory tends to support rather than refute Pritchett's contention of behavioral stir- rings in biography. The argument is that judi- cial biographers were early or proto-behavioral- 2' Swisher, Field, pp. 203-204.</page><page sequence="8">1971 Judicial Biography and the Behavioral Persuasion 711 ists in the sense of the behavior they studied and their attempted explanations. This argument is buttressed when a raw count in fifteen judicial biographies produces a total of 2,232 behav- ioral-like propositions (for an average of 149 per biography). Though a parallel proposition- count in behavioral literature would presumably produce much smaller quantities, it is illuminat- ing that biographers attempt causal explana- tions to the extent that Beveridge's Marshall (1916) contains 237 behavioral-like proposi- tions, Swisher's Taney (1935) contains 151, and Mason's Stone (1956) contains the most of all, 340. Even the most "legalistic" work, Paschal's brief life of Justice Sutherland, has 81. Qualifiers also may take comfort in the as- sociation, at least at the top end, between prop- osition production and consensus about quality. Mason, Beveridge, Pusey, and Swisher lead the pack. Is not explanatory insight rather than lit- erary style the primary reason for their pres- tige?27 Since counting propositions tells little about their content, the more important question is: what kinds of information do judicial biogra- phies produce? A detailed content analysis of propositions in fifteen biographies is beyond the scope of one paper, and the shaky empirical foundations of many propositions make yield assessments risky. But a preliminary appraisal leads to the conclusion that the accumulated empirical findings of judicial biographies relate to behavioral inquiry-positively, by generating hypotheses worthy of empirical validation; neg- atively, by making the search for regularities, theory, and rigorous methods indispensable. In support of that conclusion I shall summarize briefly the highlights of propositional content within each category of the inventory by de- scribing: (1) how biographies handle such in- formation, (2) some illustrations of the propo- sitions that appear in biographies, and (3) some suggested hypotheses that merit empirical exploration. Personality. The strongest impression in this category is biographical neglect of the personal- ity roots of judicial behavior. Not only does personality generate a relatively small number of propositions, but they are overwhelmingly superficial rather than in-depth observations "Although the sample of authors is too small for meaningful correlation, students of biography may be interested that the inventory (1) suggests no rise in the quantity of behavioral-like output through time, (2) offers little support for tempting distinctions be- tween biographical schools-e.g., a political jurispru- dence school i la Swisher or an attitudinal school i la Mason, and (3) shows no large variances by pro- fession of author. drawn from psychological models. Reid, for ex- ample, distinguishes the judicial styles of Holmes and Doe in terms of contrasting needs for public approval. 28 The personalities of Waite, Taft, Hughes, and Stone are described as well suited to judicial roles.9 Yet the under- lying elements of such propositions are seldom articulated or related via personality theory. Most biographies, it is true, exploit the medi- um's strong suit-human interest. What table or scale can match in appeal the portrayals of Field's cussedness, Hughes' imperiousness, or Doe's eccentricities? So long as people yearn for vicarious experience-the personal tri- umphs and tragedies of eminent men-biogra- phy needs no further justification. From a sci- entific viewpoint, human interest actually may be biography's worst enemy. Surface descrip- tion is so easy. Another hazard presents itself if justices like Frankfurter and Murphy, heeding Clio's claim, write memos for future biogra- phers.30 Then we may have to reverse Voltaire: history becomes the tricks the dead play on the living! These problems are normal hazards of his- torical method. More serious is the limited yield of descriptive biography concerning the personality determinants of judicial behavior. No Freudian inferences, adolescent identity crises, or psychosomatic illnesses jar these pages, though such concepts are central in psy- chological analyses of other political leaders, and we know that judges underwent similar ex- periences.3' Can Justice Miller's intense aboli- tionist commitment be traced to a childhood trauma of watching his Mammy being flogged? Can Chief Justice Fuller's skill as a presiding officer be attributed to ingratiating traits devel- oped as a result of his parents' 1833 divorce?32 Individually, biographers suggest several scraps and clues but make little of them. The cumulative product is hardly more sub- stantial. The only regularity found in these fif- teen studies concerns leadership.

From that uniformity it might be inferred that judges are homo politicos in robes, politicians without difference. On the other hand, if these biographers are correct in asserting that each chief justice on the list (Marshall, Taney, Fuller, Waite, Taft, Hughes, Stone, Shaw, Doe) developed a distaste for po- litical office before appointment, then collec- tively they offer the germ of an important hy- pothesis about selective socialization. This hy- pothesis relates to basic theoretical issues of po- litical leadership, uniformity versus uniqueness, and a- long-neglected question posed by Lass- well-the interplay of office and personality.33 Even so, the least satisfactory state of bio- graphical knowledge concerns the relation of personality to judicial behavior. That is ironic in view of the premises of the medium. Yet ju- dicial biographers as a class lack "the tools and the daring" to plumb the psychological roots of judicial behavior.34 Attitudinal analysts, unfor- tunately, come off no better with in-depth anal- ysis, and aggregationists seldom try. Personally, I have reservations about psychobiography as a solution, but if psychological models would help overcome the general discomfort of politi- cal scientists about personality analysis or the particular discomfort of biographers about gen- eralization, then resources invested in both sin- gle-actor and aggregative studies would be worthwhile.35 A mine of information awaits psychologically-trained observers so inclined. Socialization and Recruitment. With the ex- ception of Mason's Taft, all the biographies surveyed relate political attitudes and behavior to social and party background characteristics. Perhaps the clearest causal connections be- tween class origins and judicial behavior are Swisher's explanations of Taney's conduct in Dred Scott and of Justice Story's predilections generally.36 Beyond describing the effects of background on value systems, biographers also assert more particular socialization proposi- tions, such as paternal influence on political ideology and party identification (Marshall, Johnson, Waite) or family influence on choice 33Harold D.

One is professional socializa- tion. How did all these successful lawyers, as alleged, escape the "corporation lawyer" taint? The other is the noninfluence of religion. Why did the intense religious partisanship of the times escape most of these jurists-or their biographers? The political party basis of recruitment to high appellate courts is so uniformly proposed in these biographies as to pass for conventional wisdom. On closer examination, however, the strength of the party variable in judicial selec- tion appears to decline when mixed with other criteria such as age, section, or professional prestige. The strength of the party variable also declines as a decisional determinant when mixed with other intervening variables. While several biographies assert a sectional or party basis of voting behavior in particular deci- sions, there is little support for the pervasive behavioral generalization that party is the strongest background-behavior correlation. The main reason is that biographical description is overwhelmingly discrete. Hence, for both so- cialization and recruitment we may conclude that (1) biographies yield familiar information long since absorbed into behavioral hypotheses, and (2) the task nonetheless remains un- finished. Inputs. The notion that judicial biographers consider courts in splendid isolation from the political environment is not supported by these studies. External demands and supports con- stitute the largest quantity of propositions (more than 1?3) about the way judges behave.

Verification, of course, is something else again. Although biographers seldom test their own propositions, they are suggestive at several lev- els of explanation. At cultural levels, for in- stance, they identify clusters of environmental variables, such as economic and social condi- tions, which are germane to theories of legal change and political development. At lower lev- els of generalization, so many biographers talk about the party pressures and interest configu- rations confronting adjudicators that it is odd that none overtly subscribes to an interest- group theory of judicial politics. In addition, bi- ographies collectively provide our richest source regarding observance of judicial proprie- ties.43 Several of these biographies also confirm a favorite proposition of leadership study-sit- uational ambiguity increases scope for individu- ality.44 Some biographies tacitly accept de Tocqueville's proposition that judicial power is ultimately the power of public opinion. Other biographies assert that judicial policy-making is inherently incremental and that certain conflicts are not amenable to judicial resolution. Surely these assertions bear so closely on questions of uniformity and uniqueness, not to mention nor- mative debates and institutional designs, that recommendations for empirical validation need no elaboration. With inputs we come to the most developed subject, the area of greatest professional over- lap among political scientists and with other disciplines. This overlap is important, because it suggests that the basic analytical problem is not the range of political phenomena thought 40 Mason, Taft, pp. 18, 20ff., 30.

The above observation also applies to the process of converting personal values and other inputs into decisions. Although behavioral decision- making models are more explicit, there is little substantive difference in what biographers and behavioralists regard as relevant to conversion and the intra-court relations which operate, hy- pothetically, as intervening variables between attitudes and behavior. Biographies are filled with analysis of personal values-e.g., Taft's commitment to stare decisis or Waite's to the Union-and evaluations of their influence in such decisions as the Child Labor and Civil Rights Cases.45 Many propositions in this cate- gory concern individual "role of the Court" conceptions, which usually convert into role perceptions that in given cases either con- strained or rationalized a judge's policy predi- lections. Even more than behavioralists, biogra- phers also describe a mass of interpersonal fac- tors that mediate between personal attitudes and collegial action. Leadership styles, strate- gies, freshman socialization, bargaining, inter- nal organization-all these and more compli- cate the mix. The first serious scholarship re- garding intra-court interaction was undoubtedly biographical, and Peltason with reason regards the findings as biography's major contribution.46 The difficulty is that biographical description of "inner workings" suffers the same defects of imprecision, discreteness, and nonverification, noted earlier, which gave rise to the behavioral persuasion. No biography compares in preci- sion or alertive power to the explicit, behav- iorally-influenced model used in Murphy's Ele- ments of Judicial Strategy (except possibly Ma- son's Stone, which draws partially on the same data). On the other hand, biographies supply untapped raw materials for generating and re- fining hypotheses about decision making.47 "Mason, Taft, pp. 251, 262. Magrath, op. cit., p. 153. 46 Peltason, op. cit., p. 233. "For example, cross-reference suggests one theoret- ical refinement.

Hughes dominated conferences to the point of torpor, but dissent rates suggest that Hughes hardly dominated the policy output of his court in the sense of Mar- shall, Shaw, or Doe. If a chief justice's effectiveness as task leader is measured by dissent rate, Taft comes off as more effective than Hughes. Cf. Danelski, op. cit.</page><page sequence="11">714 The American Political Science Review Vol. 65 They highlight personal behavior and relate it to interpersonal behavior, one of the most diffi- cult and therefore neglected linkages in empiri- cal analysis. And they retain historical perspec- tive, which permits attention to attitude change. In much jurimetric research, by contrast, atti- tudes are perforce static, and group processes are subsumed under personal attitudes in order to achieve operational definitions.48 Apart from serving as data sources, biographies thus com- plement behavioral research by providing par- tial correctives for necessary shortcuts. Outputs. Generally speaking, what character- izes inputs holds also for legal and political out- puts. Most of these biographies do attempt to assess the political impact of judicial decisions, though usually in formal, institutional terms and by a case approach which eschews broadly functional generalizations. Many of the propo- sitions merely report public opinion responses to particular judges and decisions-e.g., Mar- shall's unpopularity after the Burr trial or his popularity after Gibbons.49 The accuracy of the measurement also leaves much to be desired. While Beveridge, Mason, and Pusey used news- papers to illustrate public reactions and Fair- man occasionally Shepardized cases, biogra- phies are simply outclassed by modern impact analysis.50 Still, the cumulative message is un- mistakable: judges make public policy. Functionally, this proposition is probably ov- erdone. That judges make policy is the begin- ning, not the end, of sophistication. Sophistica- tion begins with differentiation of policy roles ac- cording to time, subject-matter, and institution.51 Biographies generally offer only spasmodic attention to issues of uniformity and unique- ness at this level. Yet on revisiting the liter- ature, this reader was struck by the freshness of a few. Their works go beyond case description by offering functionally relevant ideas, such as not-so-new roles in system maintenance, con- flict resolution, legitimation, and public educa- tion.52 For example, Beveridge implies and 48 Exceptions are David J. Danelski, "Values as Variables in Judicial Decision-Making," 19 Vanderbilt Law Review, 721 (1966); Dorothy B. James, "Role Theory and the Supreme Court," Journal of Politics, 30 (1968), p. 160; and Glendon Schubert, "Jackson's Judicial Philosophy," op. cit., p. 940. 49Beveridge, op. cit., III, pp. 357, 528, 595; IV, pp. 396, 454, 517. " See, e.g., Theodore L. Becker (ed.), The Impact of Supreme Court Decisions (New York: Oxford University Press, 1969). 51 See Martin Shapiro, Law and Politics in the Su- preme Court: New Approaches to Political Jurispru- dence (New York: The Free Press, 1964). 52 See, e.g., Beveridge, op. cit., IV, p. 279; Swisher, Swisher says that pre-Civil War justices consoli- dated their own power as architects of a legal order favoring business elites and capitalist de- velopment.53 Fairman implies and Magrath says that post-Civil War justices reconsolidated their power by helping to re-establish a racist legal order favored by white middle classes.54 Compare how closely these conclusions match Dahl's concerning the relations of justices to dominant, law-making coalitions. Fairman ac- tually anticipates Dahl's argument that political recruitment is the mechanism of harmonizing the two.55 Who-said-it-first is not the name of this game. The point is merely to reaffirm the rele- vance of judicial biographies to understanding the systemic effect of judges' lives, however im- precise the measurements and imperfect the linkage between single actors and larger sys- tems. m. Summation While accenting biography, we have consid- ered the relationship between judicial biogra- phy and judicial behavior research in two ways. Conceptually, we compared them as modes of inquiry and concluded that: (a) they are re- lated by common questions, assumptions, and research problems, and (b) they are distin- guishable mainly by relative concern with de- scription and systematic explanation. Empiri- cally, we made an inventory of behavioral-like propositions and concluded that: (a) judging by proposition production, judicial biographers may be considered early or proto-behavioral- ists; and (b) judging by proposition content, ju- dicial biographies relate to behavioral inquiry -positively by offering rich description and ex- planatory insight about determinants of judicial decisions, conversion processes, and judicial policy roles; negatively by stimulating demands for closer attention to regularities, theory, and more reliable measurements which underlie the behavioral persuasion. Together, these conclu- sions resolve into a theme that began as inartic- ulate major premise. As a mode of analysis, ju- dicial biographies are complementary to behav- Field, p. 203 and Taney, pp. 415, 419; Mason, Brandeis, pp. 518, 560, and Stone, pp. 302, 426, 443, 533, 591, 605, 645. 5 Beveridge, op. cit., III, pp. 49, 75, 178; IV, pp. 276, 396, 446, 453-54, 517.
