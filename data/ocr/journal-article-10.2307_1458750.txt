<plain_text><page sequence="1">Buddhism and Zen. By RUTH S. MCCAND- LESS AND NYOGEN SENZAKI. New York: Philosophical Library, 1953. 91 pages. $3.75. Although brief, repetitious, and overpriced, this book is a handy summary of Zen Bud- dhism suitable for beginners. Some basic doctrinal concepts, some short statements of useful practices, and some semi-illuminating attempts to describe the undescribable, are drawn from the brief Sho-do-ka, "Song of Enlightenment," by the eighth century priest Yoka-daishi or read into its passages by in- terpretive commentaries by Nyogen Senzaki. The Sho-do-ka and its commentaries are sup- plemented by a translation of a few recently discovered notes by Bodhidharma, famous sixth century importer of Buddhism from India to China, a page of "Suggestions for Zen Students" by Zen Getsu, who lived about the ninth century, and the authors' answers to "ten questions most frequently asked by non-Buddhists." Zen appears, to non-Zenists, as a bunch of contradictions. This book advertises Zen which "never advertises itself." The book attempts to describe enlightenment but "no one can describe enlightenment to another." "There is no other way but silence to express it properly." "If you wish to see the Buddha, you must look into your own inner-nature; this nature is the Buddha himself." Yet, "Do not desire to become a Buddha. If you do, you will never become one." However, all this does not bother the Zenist whose favorite teaching device is the ko-an, "a problem given to the student for solution, the answer to which cannot be reached intellectually." En- lightenment arrives only suddenly, when de- sire and intellect disappear in a peaceful, but alert and enjoyed, indifference. He who is proud that he is a Zenist is not a Zenist, and he who knows he has arrived has not arrived, for in Zen there is neither pride nor knowl- edge. The authors take some blunt slaps at Chris- tianity: "Buddhists left anthropomorphic ideas behind twenty-five centuries ago." "There is no blood stain on the history of Buddhist proselyting. In no instance have they tried to destroy the customs of other faiths or countries by ridicule or force," but "the Christian-Moslem view has usually been that destruction must precede construction. ." Needless to say, the open-minded reader will find the book challenging. ARCHIE J. BAHM University of New Mexico</page></plain_text>
