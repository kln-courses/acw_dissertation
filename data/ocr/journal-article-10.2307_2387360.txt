This amphibian suffered a major decline dtiring the first half of the twentieth century, due partly to habitat destruction but mostly to successional changes in its specialized biotopes and anthropogenic acidification of breeding sites. In addition to site and species protection, extensive autecological research over the past 25 years has provided the foundations for an intensive, 3-year species recoveryprogram funded by the statutory nature conservation organizations (English Nature and the Countryside Councilfor Wales). This pro- gram was based on habitat management and reintroductions to restored sites andfollouled similar but less in- tensive efforts. Management of heath and dune habitats focused on restoration and maintenance of early stages of seral succession, initially through physical clearance of invasive scrub and woodland vegetation and later by the reestablishment of grazing regimes similar to those prevalent in earlier centuries. In some cases ex- tra breeding pools were provided to either increase or stabilize natterjack toad populations that had become reliant on one or very few pools at small sites or to promote range expansion within large habitat areas. By 1995 proactive conservation work had been carried out at 29 (69%Y,) of the 39 sites with extant native popula- tions, including 8 during the recovery program. Twenty reintroductions also had been attempted, including nine during the program. At least six reintroductions resulted in the foundation of expanding new popula- tions, and an additional eight have shown initial signs of sticcess. Conservation methods developedfor Bufo ca- lamita should provide a useful precedent for long-term conservation of early successional habitats and species.

Introduction In the past few years concern has increased about declin- ing amphibian populations in several countries around the world, especially with respect to species living at high altitudes and in habitats not obviously vulnerable to direct impacts from human activities (Blaustein &amp; Wake 1990; Wake 1991; Blaustein et al. 1994a; Pounds &amp; Crump 1994). The extent to which amphibians are declining more than other groups is the subject of contention, partly because they seem to have fared no worse than other taxa (i.e., reptiles in Europe [Beebee 1992] and ver- tebrates in general [Smith et al. 1993]), but also because of the inherent difficulty of distinguishing between long- term declines and natural short-term fluctuations in popu- lation sizes (Pechmann &amp; Wilbur 1994). Nevertheless, some species seem to be in trouble; causes include habi- tat destruction (Cooke &amp; Ferguson 1976; Dodd 1991), pesticide pollution (Hazelwood 1970), spread of patho- genic diseases (Laurance et al. 1996), increased road traf- fic (Fahrig et al. 1995), introduction of alien species such as Rana catesbiana in Spain (Arano et al. 1995), and en- hanced UV-B irradiation (due to damage to the atmo- spheric ozone layer) causing increased egg mortality (Blaustein et al. 1994b). It is unlikely, therefore, that am- phibian declines around the world share a common cause (Griffiths &amp; Beebee 1992)-multiple factors will often play a part. Similarly, multiple factors contribute to losses at a local scale. The UV-B effects, for example, can act syn- ergistically with both low pH and with infection by patho- genic fungi (Kiesecker &amp; Blaustein 1995; Long et al. 1995). The natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) is a native of western and central Europe, but in the northern part of its range it is confined to a few specific habitat types, particularly coastal sand dunes, saltmarshes, and inland heaths (Beebee 1983; Fig. 1). A massive decline during the early part of the twentieth century resulted in the species disappearing from more than 75% of its histori- cal sites in Britain, particularly from those on the heath- lands of southern and eastern England (Beebee 1976). In the mid-1970s only about 40 natterjack sites (defined as discrete areas of terrestrial habitat with varying numbers of breeding ponds) remained. Numerous factors are thought to have contributed to these declines. The spe- cies was protected by law in 1975, and by 1994 more than 80% of localities with natterjack populations also had statutory habitat protection as sites of special scien- tific interest (Banks et al. 1994). We report on the conservation work carried out both before (1970-1992) and during phase one of a species recovery program (phase one extended over the 3 years 1992-1995) for natterjack toads in Britain. This included (1) the restoration of early successional habitats on heaths and dunes; (2) the maintenance of these habitat stages by sustainable economic methods; (3) countering 0 Extant native site 0 Historical site extinct before 1970 1K A10 ?

Background Information Extensive autecological studies were initiated during the 1980s to determine natterjack habitat requirements and the causes of decline. These studies identified aquatic and terrestrial habitat features of critical importance to natterjacks. Bufo calamnita is adapted to early succes- sional stages that are inherently unstable, such as sand dunes, upper salt marshes, and river flood plains. The adaptations are manifest as two life-history features with habitat implications: (1) a specialized feeding behavior in which invertebrate prey are actively pursued over open ground and (2) small larvae that grow rapidly and metamorphose after only a few weeks in the pond (Banks &amp; Beebee 1988; Denton &amp; Beebee 1994). Impor- tant terrestrial habitat features for natterjacks include ar- eas of bare ground (usually sand) on which to forage and in which to burrow and hibernate; areas of short vegeta- tion (&lt;30 cm high) sustaining prey invertebrates; and generally open (unforested) terrain promoting high sum- mer ~ teprtre tgondlvl mpratauai ai Conservation Biology Volume 11, No. 6, December 1997</page><page sequence="3">Denton et al. Natter]ack Toad in Britain 1331 tat features include shallow, exposed (usually ephemeral) pools with warm water (&gt;200C) to sustain rapid tadpole growth rates; circumneutral pH (6.0-8.5); and few pred- ators or tadpole competitors. Natterjacks also benefited in the past from the anthropomorphic creation of habi- tats with these properties, such as heathlands sustained by timber cutting and livestock grazing. Direct habitat destruction, including agricultural recla- mation, afforestation with conifer plantations, and urban construction, was substantive but not the most impor- tant reason for the widespread disappearance of Bufo calamita (Beebee 1977, 1983). Of greater significance was seral succession on heathlands, and to a lesser ex- tent on dunes, from the early stages typified by very open habitat with dwarf shrub or grassy sward commu- nities to later stages characterized by extensive scrub and tree invasion. This alteration of habitat structure cre- ated conditions suitable for the common toad (Bufo bufo), which has clearly displaced natterjacks over large areas that, apart from successional changes, are other- wise little different from historical descriptions (Beebee 1977; Denton &amp; Beebee 1994). Bufo bufo does not sur- vive well in the early-successional, open conditions of heaths or dunes, but it encroaches after scrub-mediated alterations of microclimate. The early spring breeding of B. bufo produces tadpoles that out-compete those of the later-breeding B. calamita (Banks &amp; Beebee 1987; Grif- fiths 1991). The deterioration of heath and dune habitats due to successional processes has been extensively documented in Britain and is associated with major losses of other rare fauna and flora (Van der Meulen 1982; Marrs et al. 1986; Webb 1986, 1990) dependent upon these distinctive ec- osystems. Although coastal dunes represent one of the few examples of primary habitat remaining in Britain, most dune systems and probably all heathlands were used for low-density livestock grazing until the end of the nineteenth century. Apart from the most exposed loca- tions, such as frontal dune ridges, this type of manage- ment now seems essential for their perpetuation (Fuller &amp; Boorman 1977; Webb 1986). Indeed, the heathlands of northwestern Europe are almost entirely anthropogenic in origin and were grazed continuously (and occasionally burned) after the major forest clearances that created them some 5000 years ago (Webb 1986). Furthermore, the oligotrophic and dystrophic pools that form on leached heathland substrates are highly vulnerable to an- thropogenic acidification. Natterjacks require circum- neutral ponds for successful reproduction; in at least one site a fall in pH due to recent atmospheric pollution ren- dered the major breeding pool too acidic for natterjack larval development (Beebee &amp; Griffin 1977; Beebee et al. 1990). It seems likely on the basis of previous natterjack records and recent pH measurements that acidification has occurred elsewhere on heathlands and must have af- fected other elements of the freshwater biota. About 36% of the surviving natterjack populations in Britain averaged less than 100 adults over 10 years of monitoring (Banks et al. 1994), giving rise to concern that they may be below minimum viable population sizes (Laan &amp; Verboom 1990; Nunney &amp; Campbell 1993). Frag- mentation and isolation of surviving populations has also increased, and recent investigation has revealed very low levels of genetic diversity in British B. calamita popula- tions (Hitchings &amp; Beebee 1996), posing long-term risks from environmental, demographic and genetic stochas- ticity. Adult population density of B. calamita is directly related to breeding pond density (Beebee et al. 1996), and it is often possible to increase population size by dig- ging more ponds. Also, amphibians may exist as metapo- pulations in which source and sink breeding pools some- times coexist within interconnected habitat patches (Gill 1978; Sjogren 1991). Creation of a network of ponds of varying depths should improve prospects for maintaining metapopulations because one or more ideal depth (deep enough to persist until metamorphosis, but not so deep as to harbor large numbers of predators) is likely to be available every year irrespective of weather conditions. Although work on natterjack toad conservation started in the 1970s, the concept of undertaking recovery pro- grams for threatened species in Britain was only recently promoted by the statutory conservation organizations (Whitten 1990). In 1991 the species recovery program was launched by English Nature; by 1996 the program en- compassed almost 100 species projects. The projects have three phases: "pre-recovery" in which recovery feasibility is assessed; "phase 1" in which intensive work to improve status is carried out, usually over 3-5 years; and "phase 2" in which follow-up work over at least a decade consoli- dates and secures the gains made during phase 1. Bufo ca- lamita was among the first suite of species included in the recovery program because of the large amount of auteco- logical information already at hand by 1991. Rationale and Methods Restoration of Early Successional Habitats on Heaths and Dunes In the absence of management or as a consequence of anthropogenic stabilization of habitats (such as preven- tion of dune accretion by beach cleaning), many natter- jack sites have progressed to late stages of seral succes- sion. A variety of evidence was used to assess what the habitat had formerly been like at these sites and to guide objectives for restoration. This included photographic records of successional change, accounts by local natu- ralists, and specific information about changes in natter- jack populations or in numbers of competitor species. On both heaths and dunes, restoration involved re- moval of invasive scrub and woodland, mostly buckthorn C,onservration Bio:logyr Volumec 11, No. 6, December 1997</page><page sequence="4">1332 Natter]ack Toad in Britain Denton et al. (Hippophae rhamnoides) and birch (Betula spp.) on dunes, and birch, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and gorse (Ulex europaea) on heathland. In dune systems this was often achieved by means of heavy machinery, mostly track vehicles with blades or grab-arms, leaving disturbed grass and herb layers with extensive areas of bare sand but without destroying the soil profile. These restorations created habitat structures similar to those of early succes- sional stages of the kind still maintained naturally by wind action on exposed frontal dune ridges. Natural accretion was encouraged, where possible, by the cessation of beach-cleaning operations and by restricting access by motor vehicles. On heathland in which the heather (mostly Calluna vulgaris) understory survived, scrub was usually removed by manual cutting to minimize dam- age to the shrub layer. This was necessary because heath- ers take several decades to reach maturity and are easily killed by mechanical trampling, which leaves the habitat unsatisfactory for many of the rarer species. In this habitat areas of exposed substrate were created by rotovation of patches or tracks interwoven among stands of undis- turbed heath. Stumps of deciduous scrub or tree species, if not removed, were treated with herbicides to prevent regrowth. All cut vegetation was burned to remove as many nutrients as possible from the ecosystem. Maintenance of Heaths and Dunes by Sustainable Economic Methods Long-term maintenance of early successional habitats by economically sustainable methods was an essential objec- tive after completion of restorative management. The re- introduction of management regimes that achieved this aimn in the past-notably low-density (&lt;1 animal/3 ha) livestock grazing to control or prevent scrub regenera- tion-was the method of choice. Sheep or cattle were used on different sites; some were grazed for all and oth- ers for part of the year. Ease of establishing grazing re- gimes varied. Some dune and upper salt marsh sites have always been grazed, but others required prior erection of stock-proof fencing and acquisition of animals, gener- ally on a lease-lend basis with local farmers. Countering Anthropogenic Acidification of Breeding Pools Natterjacks require circumneutral pools for successftil development of their spawn and tadpoles. Anthropo- genic acidification is considered a major threat on heath- lands, where the oligotrophic pools are weakly buffered. Direct evidence of acidification is expensive and time- consuming to obtain, but it was available for one site (Beebee et al. 1990). Elsewhere, inferences about likely acidification were made on the basis of historical infor- mation about water quality, especially records of plants typical of circumneutral water and of previous successful use by natterjacks within the past century. Two methods Conser-vation Biology Volulme 11, No 6, December 1997 were employed to restore acidified heathland ponds to circumneutrality. At three sites the minimum quantities of Ca(OH)2 necessary to raise pH to between 6.5 and 7.0 were added to ponds in powder form early in the spring before toad breeding started. Amounts were kept as low as possible to avoid the development of calciphile com- munities, which would be atypical of heathlands, and it was generally necessary to make additions every year or every second year to maintain the circumneutral pH necessary for natterjack development. A second method at one large site exploited the shallow and ephemeral nature of natterjack breeding ponds. In this case the thin silt bed with its accumulated sulphate load was scraped away when the large (10-ha) pond desiccated in sum- mer. After refilling, this pond had a pH of over 5.5, com- pared with less than 4.5 before scraping, for several years afterwards (Beebee et al. 1990). Enhancement of Population Size Small, isolated populations are especially vulnerable to extinction, which has significant management implica- tions. Population size is related to availability of breed- ing habitat (Beebee et al. 1996); consequently, enhance- ment of populations as well as development of a functional metapopulation may be possible through pond creation. Minimum viable population size is not known for this spe- cies, although colonies of less than 100 adults have per- sisted for many generations, and this number was adopted as a minimum target size for all populations pending ftir- ther study. Pond creation was therefore considered appro- priate at all sites with small toad populations and where there was evidence of lowered water tables, which re- duces the breeding success of toads at existing ponds. Natterjacks favor ephemeral pools with very shallow margins that desiccate around midsummer in a year of average rainfall. Pond excavation was usually carried out by means of heavy machinery, with care being taken to generate basins of appropriate shape and depth (less than 1 m maximum depth in midwinter) and in particu- lar to avoid overdeepening. Ponds created on heathland sites were in some cases lined with concrete to counter acidification and retain water above natural water tables. New ponds were subsequently monitored both for use as spawning sites and also to determine whether meta- morphosis was successful. The former was quantified by counting of spawn strings and the latter by estimation, to within an order of magnitude, of toadlet production. B. calamita females usually deposit a single spawn string each year, laid in shallow water (&lt;10 cm) and not inter- twined with those of other animals (Beebee 1983). Count- ing spawn strings is therefore a useftil method for estimat- ing adult numbers (sex ratios are usually about unity). The long-term effects on adult population size, judged by total spawn string production at a site, were also monitored over the years subsequent to pond creation.</page><page sequence="5">Denton et al. Natter]ack Toad in Britain 1333 Reintroductions to Restore Historical Range An important objective of the recovery program was to reestablish the species at a series of representative sites that would, as far as possible, reconstitute its historical range. This procedure falls within the definition of rein- troduction accepted by the World Conservation Union (1994). Priority was given to localities on heathlands in southern and eastern England, following as close as pos- sible to well-documented historical records. Sites were chosen in which habitat was judged either already suit- able or easily made so. Management was carried out as necessary to restore both terrestrial and aquatic habitat features, and then natterjacks were introduced as spawn. The equivalent of two full strings, about 5000-6000 eggs, but as samples from several strings to maximize genetic diversity, were translocated per year for 2 consecutive years. These were usually taken from the nearest native population on the same habitat type. Survival to meta- morphosis was monitored by estimating toadlet emer- gence to within an order of magnitude. Re-introduction success was measured against three criteria: (1) initial success, when at least tens of toadlets emerged in at least one of the two reintroduction years; (2) intermediate success, when adults returned to breed within 3 years (the age of sexual maturity) of the beginning of reintro- duction; and (3) complete success, when breeding con- tinued at the site for at least 5 years, adult numbers re- mained stable or increased over that time, and toadlets from second-generation spawn were produced. A failure was ascribed to any attempt that did not result in adults returning and breeding successfully within 10 years of the first spawn translocation. Results Restoration and Maintenance of Terrestrial Habitats Problems from successional processes were more acute in some habitats than others (Table 1). All the few re- maining heathland sites were affected, about 50% of dune sites but less than 10% of salt marshes. The contin- uation of livestock grazing on most salt marshes and on many dune systems largely accounted for the lower lev- els of scrub invasion, and conservation effort was tar- geted at the heath and dune sites most at risk. These in- cluded two of the three remaining heathland sites, where in each case tens of hectares of pine, birch, and gorse were removed. Common toad invasion at two of the heathland sites was lower than on many others where succession had progressed, apparently for site- specific reasons (heavy grazing by wild rabbits [Oryctol- agus cuniculus] at one, acidification of all the deeper pools at the other), probably explaining why natterjacks persisted there. By contrast, common toads were so nu- Table 1.

Scrub problems were less widespread on dunes, partly because successional processes are inherently slower in exposed coastal areas and partly because about 40% of dune sites were still grazed by domestic livestock. Scrub invasion on some dune systems became acute in recent decades, however, and in one particular locality on the Merseyside coast the alien shrub Hippophae rhamnoides spread so rampantly that B. calamita was replaced by B. bufo over more than 70% of the dunes between 1970 and 1985. Although open habitats are provided by initial distur- bance of the ground during scrub clearance, further management is required to sustain the habitat structures required by B. calamita and other key elements of early successional fauna and flora. In the absence of grazing, it was necessary to carry out clearances every few years. B. calamita increased in numbers or extended its range on four sites with extensive clearances. Trends at four of the managed sites are not yet clear, although natterjacks certainly persist, whereas at the other two managed sites clearance was less complete and natterjacks have continued to decline. By 1995 scrub clearance had been carried out at 10 of the 16 sites deemed to require it, in- cluding three large-scale exercises during phase 1 of the recovery program. In view of the endangered status of B. calamita, no sites were left deliberately uncleared as controls because early work indicated the importance of open habitats to this species (Beebee 1977), but natter- jack populations remained precarious or were maintained by artificial methods (such as removal of common toads) at the six sites where scrub removal was not possible. Sites where grazing was maintained appeared to be much poorer habitats for common toads than were un- C:onserva?tion Biolo)gy Volumel 1I1, No 6, December 1997</page><page sequence="6">1334 Natter]ack Toad in Britain Denton et al. grazed sites (Table 1). Grazing has persisted in more than 80% of salt marshes, and in this habitat natterjack populations generally thrived best, needing little or no scrub control. Over the past 10 years grazing regimes have been reestablished at seven sites with a view to maintaining early successional stages in the long term, including two initiated during the recovery program. One major area of natterjack habitat (a large section of the Merseyside dunes) was targeted before and during the recovery program. Clearfelling of a pine plantation and reintroduction of sheep grazing was achieved on part of the site, whereas scrub removal from another 40 ha was completed in preparation for grazing in future. Much more time will be needed before it will be possi- ble to make a proper assessment of the effects of the new grazing regimes on natterjack toads, but studies comparing grazed and ungrazed habitats have proved encouraging with respect to both utilization by this spe- cies and to decreased occupancy by B. bufo (Denton &amp; Beebee 1996) and the reappearance of other species typical of early successional stages. Restoration and Management of Aquatic Habitats Anthropogenic acidification of breeding ponds was spe- cifically identified at one of the surviving heathland sites of B. calamita and has probably affected others from which the species has disappeared (Beebee et al. 1990). Although control of pollutant emission and consequent relief of ecosystem acid loads must remain the long-term goal, this is unlikely to be realized within the time neces- sary for amphibian conservation at sensitive sites (Jug- gins et al. 1996). During the 1980s, therefore, addition of quicklime (annually) or removal of bottom sediment (as a single exercise) were carried out on the acidified site at two separate pools with pH of less than 4.5. Both treatments restored pH to circumneutrality, and both ponds were subsequently used for spawning by natter- jacks. Tadpole mortality in the two ponds remained higher than in naturally circumneutral pools, however, apparently because numbers of invertebrate predators became exceptionally large, and no metamorphic suc- cess has yet occurred in either pond (Banks et al. 1993). In contrast, neutralization of pools with quicklime at an- other heathland site prior to a reintroduction during the mid 1980s was successful, and a natterjack population to- tally dependent on these pools has become established there; lime addition has also created conditions that sup- port natterjack development through to metamorphosis in several previously acidic ponds in a third area. A common management approach at many sites has been to create totally new ponds (Table 2). This was of- ten necessary to rescue populations because historical breeding sites were damaged or destroyed, but another frequent objective was to increase adult population sizes. The intention in these cases also was to stabilize Conservation Biology Volume 11, No. 6, December 1997 Table 2. Pond creation at natterjack toad sites in Britain since 1970."

Pond creation was therefore usually targeted to localities where population size was small (&lt;100 adults) or en- dangered by pond loss. Because most natterjack popula- tions fell into one of these categories, over the past 25 years over 200 ponds have been created, spread be- tween about 67% of the extant sites, including 15 con- structed during the recovery program. At all sites at least one and usually most of the ponds were used by natter- jacks within 1 or 2 years of their creation. In about half of the sites the new ponds rescued the populations from probable extinction, as judged by the absence of suc- cessftil reproduction in any other water body. Overall more than 65% of populations provided with new ponds were rescued or increased (as measured by spawn string counts) in the years following pond creation. This type of management has proved successful on all habitat types, but not every population responded with substan- tive size increases. Failures could be attributed to poor siting (two instances), inadequate terrestrial habitat man- agement accompanying pond creation (two instances), or overdeepening after misjudgement of water-table low- ering (three instances). Efforts are currently being made to rescue populations using ponds suffering from the wa- ter-table problem by making the pools shallower. To be successful, therefore, restoration or creation of ephem- eral ponds requires careful planning and execution, in- cluding measurement of water-table fluctuations over several seasons. Reintroduction Returning natterjack populations to areas where they re- cently have become extinct has proved increasingly suc- cessful over the past 25 years. Out of 20 attempts at rein- troduction, only 6 have definitely failed according to the criteria we defined (Table 3), and 5 of these were the first efforts of the early 1970s. All three reintroductions to dune sites have succeeded within the limits of judge- ment possible at the present time, although only one is</page><page sequence="7">Denton et al.

The 6 unsuccessful efforts, all on heathland, failed by the first criterion, and no suc- cessful metamorphosis was recorded at any of them for reasons subsequently related to poor water quality in the ponds. Of the remaining 11 attempts on heathland, 5 have been completely successful and 6 are too recent (&lt;3 years old) for anything other than a preliminary as- sessment, although all produced toadlets in their first year and have thus satisfied the first criterion. New ponds were created at all three of the dune sites simply by excavating below the water table, whereas on heathland the situation was more complex. All the fail- ures utilized natural water tables, whereas only 4 of the 11 more successful ventures relied on this source. Three of these 4 are 7 or more years old and have generated self-perpetuating natterjack populations, although one site requires occasional addition of quicklime to main- tain circumneutral pHs in the two breeding ponds. One of the other 7 sites, the first successful natterjack trans- location (started in 1980), has created another very large population in eastern England that relies entirely on a single pool with a butyl plastic liner.

The remaining 6 sites, including one longstanding success, (&gt;10 years) have concrete-lined ponds. Supportive management for reintroductions has included scrub clearance at 2 of the 3 dune and 7 of the current 11 heath sites and the establishment of grazing at 1 dune and 2 heath sites. Discussion Conservation measures for natterjack toads in Britain have improved in effectiveness over the past 25 years as critical habitat features have been identified and the much broader issues associated with habitat manage- ment were successfully addressed. It is in the arena of early successional habitat conservation that work on B. calamita has proved particularly relevant. It is well known that open habitats are often maintained by graz- ing regimes (Dix 1959; McCune &amp; Cottam 1985); many such ecosystems in temperate zones arose following an- thropogenic forest clearances and have been maintained by regular disturbance ever since, although some were developed naturally by large herds of wild herbivores (Van Wieren 1995) or wind erosion on exposed coastal sites. Even on these, however, grazing by domestic ani- mals has played a part and has become more important in recent decades following declines in wild herbivores and the introduction to many sites of alien tree and scrub species (such as Rhododendron ponticum and Hippophae rhamnoides). The coincidence of these plant introductions with the mass extermination of rab- bits, the main natural herbivore of these habitats, during the mid-twentieth century by myxomatosis infection led to widespread overstabilization of dune systems in Britain (Fuller &amp; Boorman 1977). In addition, livestock farming on such marginal land became increasingly uneconomi- cal and mostly ceased by the early years of the twentieth century. Conservation of heaths and dunes therefore re- quires the clearance of a large backlog of scrub and tree invasion, followed by reinstatement of management prac- tices necessary to maintain early successional habitats, most especially low-density livestock grazing. Fire, al- though used elsewhere and occasionally used on heath- land to restore early successional stages, has deleterious long-term effects on vegetation structure and is generally less appropriate than the use of livestock (Bullock &amp; Webb 1995). Although grazing is unlikely to be economi- cal from the point of view of commercial agriculture, it seems likely to be the cheapest as well as the most effec- tive way of maintaining such habitats for conservation purposes. After the initial costs involved in perimeter fence installation and livestock purchase are met, mainte- nance management by grazing should at least break even and may even be marginally profitable (Kottmann et al. Conservation Biology Volulme 11, No 6, December 1997</page><page sequence="8">1336 Natter;ack Toad in Britain Denton et al. 1985). Comparable situations elsewhere in the world are attracting similar solutions (e.g., wetland management for bog turtles [Clemmys mublenbergii; Tryon &amp; Herman 1990]), but there is still considerable scope for experi- mentation with grazing regimes. It will certainly be ifn- portant to establish the most appropriate times of year to use livestock and to avoid overgrazing and the range of different problems (including vegetation damage and im- poverishment of reptile fauna) that can result from it (Jones 1981; Fleischerer 1994; Noss 1994). At the species level, short-term measures for B. calam- ita have mainly involved pond creation or restoration. Mostly, ponds have been put in place following destruc- tion of or serious damage to the original breeding sites, including the lowering of the water table by land drain- age, overgrowth with scrub or rank vegetation, and an- thropogenic acidification. These were therefore essen- tial rescue measures and have largely succeeded in their aim of maintaining viable natterjack populations, at least for a few years. A secondary objective was to increase toad numbers at many sites, taking account of the need to maintain assumed minimum viable population sizes (of about 100 adults) and adequate metapopulation structures in the face of long-term threats from environ- mental, demographic, or genetic stochasticity (Nunney &amp; Campbell 1993; Harrison &amp; Hastings 1996). Evidence shows that natterjack population size is limited by pond availability and that increasing pond numbers can have positive effects on population size within a decade (Banks et al. 1993; Beebee et al. 1996). But at more than half the sites where pools have been created for this purpose there is as yet no evidence of a significant change in toad population size. As discussed earlier, reasons for these failures include inappropriate installations and insufficient terrestrial habitat management. We believe that two particularly important points have emerged from this recovery program: (1) it is es- sential to take into consideration all aspects of a species' ecological requirements and to ensure that management is in place to address them and (2) the conservation of threatened species requires a holistic approach at the habitat scale. Thus, while certain small-scale habitat ma- nipulations, such as the creation of breeding pools for B. calamita, may be justified for the conservation of spe- cific species, they are unlikely by themselves to be suffi- cient to ensure the long-term survival of populations. Our approach has been to integrate specific habitat man- agement needs to allow the persistence of this species within the objectives of managing for early successional communities. Reintroduction is a stringent test of autecological knowl- edge, and success rates with B. calamita have improved commensurate with ecological study. Reintroductions have therefore constituted valuable bioassays of the con- servation management methods described earlier. Be- cause historical localities for amphibians are often not Conser-vation Biology Volume 11, No. 6, December 1997 known precisely, reintroductions were often made to a general area from which natterjacks were recorded, rather than, for example, to a specific pond or marsh. Success rates of amphibian reintroductions have been in contention (Dodd &amp; Seigel 1991; Burke 1991), but in general they have been higher for common rather than rare species. Early efforts with B. calamita were justi- fied primarily as rescue operations and used animals from sites in the process of destruction; they failed be- cause aquatic and terrestrial habitat requirements were not well understood. Since 1980, however, reintroduc- tions have mostly been successful by the criteria out- lined in the section on rationale and methods; during the recent recovery program confidence was high enough to initiate 8 new sites. At all of the 15 reintro- duction sites initiated since 1980, ancillary management operations have also been carried out to restore or im- prove terrestrial or aquatic habitats, including scrub clearance (8 sites), pond creation (all 15 sites), and the introduction of grazing regimes (3 sites). The intention was to improve the quality of the entire ecosystem, and thus benefit a wide range of species, as part of the nat- terjack reintroduction program. It will of course be necessary to develop and execute conservation plans for B. calamita beyond phase 1 and into phase 2 of the formal recovery program. Such de- velopments are currently well advanced, and a full-time supervisory officer has been employed to oversee an ex- pansion of management methods, especially the restora- tion of livestock grazing regimes. Partnerships between many different people and organizations have been and will continue to be essential for success. These include statutory bodies, voluntary organizations, and private in- dividuals. Other recovery programs world-wide have demonstrated the value of intensive treatment for a rela- tively short time that leads to longer-term strategies, in- cluding ones for endangered amphibians (Alytes mu- letensis; Bloxham &amp; Tonge 1995).
