<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Puritan Origins of the American Self. By Sacvan Bercovitch. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1975. x + 250 pp. Appendix, notes, and index. $15.00. ) This book examines the "rhetoric of American identity" and the "sources of our obsessive concern with the meaning of America" (p. ix). Sacvan Bercovitch's starting point is "Nehemias Americanus," Cotton Mather's biography of John Winthrop in the Magnalia Christi Americana (1702). The Puritan found in spiritual biography "a reliable model of christic identity" (p . 24), but more important than the "exemplariness of Nehemiah" was the "idea of the exemplary American" (p. 35). As "Nehemias Americanus," Mather's Winthrop "proclaims the forward movement of redemptive history" (p . 55). Mather's use of the term "'American" fused sainthood and nationality, for America became "not merely associated with the work of redemption, but intrinsic to the unfolding pattern of types and antitypes, itseft a prophecy to be fulfilled" (p. 89). Placed firmly into the context of sacred history, America was also given "the status of visible sainthood" (p. 108). As a result, Ameri- can nationalism could become anthropomorphic, not in a secular sense, but in an eschatological framework of spiritual biography. The key to these developments was "a wholesale inversion of traditional hermeneutics" (p. 109), a shift in focus from biblical to secular history. The Puritan conception of self was uniquely that of "American Israelites, the sole reliable exegetes of a new, last book of scripture" (p. 113). Indeed, Mather turned America into a "superindividual"--"microcosm of the worldwide work of redemption, and macrocosm of the redemptive work underway in each of its chosen people." The result was what Bercovitch calls "auto- American-biography" (p. 134), a blending of national prophecy and spiritual biography into prophetic autobiography. Were the story to end with Mather, "Nehemias Americanus," and the Magnalia, readers would be left with an interesting literary artifact, a new appreciation of Mather's genius, and a book principally of interest to students of the Puritan mind and psyche. But Bercovitch carries his argument one significant step further. New England Puritan rhetoric was adaptable to later generations; it provided a useful framework in which secular values--human perfectibility, for example, or the American way--could be inverted into "the mold of sacred teleology" (p. 136). Major figures in America's literary tradi- tion, Edwards through Emerson, turned to "auto-American-biography" for a "celebration of the representative self as America, and of the American self as the embodiment of a prophetic universal design" (p. 136).</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 383 This book will challenge-and perhaps affront-many readers. Social his- torians will object to the offhand assertion that "hysteria, breakdowns, and suicides were not uncommon" in Puritan New England (p. 23). Students of the national character and American mythology may doubt whether the dis- tinction between the Puritans' vision of America and that of all other New World colonists was as sharp and as lastingly important as Bercovitch claims. And the uninitiated will balk at the language of hermeneutics and the jargon of "auto-American-biography." Nevertheless, Bercovitch makes an impor- tant contribution to scholarly understanding of the intellectual strategies and innovations of Puritan rhetoric and their importance to American Roman- ticism.
