KAUFMAN HARVARD DivINITY SCHOOL "What we desperately need is a theological ontology that will put in- telligible and credible meanings into our analogical categories of divine deeds and of divine self-manifestation through events .... Only an ontology of events specifying what God's relation to ordinary events is like, and thus what his relation to special events might be, could fill the now empty analogy of mighty acts, void since the denial of the miraculous." Langdon Gilkey 1 THE concept, "act of God," is central to the biblical understand- ing of God and his relation to the world. Repeatedly we are told of the great works performed by God in behalf of his people and in execution of his own purposes in history. From the "song of Moses," which celebrates the "glorious deeds" (Ex. 15:1 i1) through which Yahweh secured the release of the Israelites from bondage in Egypt, to the letters of Paul, which proclaim God's great act delivering us "from the dominion of darkness" (Col. 1:13) and reconciling us with himself, we are confronted with a "God who acts." 2 The "mighty acts" (Ps. 145:4), the "wondrous deeds" (Ps. 40:5), the "wonderful works" (Ps. 107:21) of God are the fundamental subject-matter of biblical history, and the object of biblical faith is clearly the One who has acted repeatedly and with power in the past and may be expected to do so in the future. I However hallowed by Bible and by traditional faith, this notion of a God who continuously performs deliberate acts in and upon his world, and in and through man's history, has become very problematical for most moderns. We have learned to conceive nature as an impersonal order or structure.

All are understood to proceed from natural causes and to lead to natural effects; in no case is it necessary to invoke the special action of God to account for such occurrences. Indeed, we have learned, especially in the last three or four hundred years, that it is precisely by excluding reference to such a transcendent agent that we gain genuine knowledge of the order that obtains in nature, are enabled to predict in certain respects the natural course of events, and thus gain a measure of control over it. The deliberate exclusion of reference to the action of God in the understanding of nature does not, of course, involve a claim that nature has become transparent to man, that there is no longer mystery in this world before which we must stand in awe. But it does mean that a particular kind of mystery is excluded: it is not to an inscrutable but personal will, apt in any moment to act in new and unpredictable ways, that such features of our world are to be referred, but simply to the mystery and obscurity of the cosmic process itself, whose infinite scope and impenetrable depths our limited minds cannot fathom. It is precisely this question about the kind of mystery which nature manifests that is at issue in the modern theological dis- cussion of miracle. The proponents of a doctrine of miracle as interruption of natural order claim that any view which holds that such deliberate acts of God do not (or cannot) occur reduces or obscures the genuine mystery in our lives, hidden ultimately in God's inscrutable will; for it involves the claim that the basic (and inviolable) order or structure of nature is in some real sense discernible by us. But those who deny the appropriateness of this view can claim that it is precisely the doctrine of miracle which refuses to face the mystery of existence, for it disposes too easily of the unusual or uncomprehended by referring them to that which is supposedly known and can be trusted, viz., the will of a God who loves and redeems his creatures; thus, the proponents of</page><page sequence="3">ACT OF GOD 177 a doctrine of miracle erode the genuine mystery of our existence, seeking to overcome their anxieties as personal beings in an im- personal world by the postulation of a purposive and personal God as its Creator and Lord. In this argument it is clearly the opponents of miracle who have won the day. Few any longer are disposed to explain the occurrence of particular events by referring them directly to God's intervention in the natural order. Although many theologians still wish to say such occurrences are possible "in principle" (for "with God all things are possible," Mt. 19:26), it is clear that both their practical decisions and actions and their theological theories are controlled by the assumption of the fun- damental autonomy of natural order. In view of the fact that this is completely inconsistent with the supposedly authoritative biblical conception of God as one who continuously acts in and upon nature as its Lord, it is little wonder that contemporary talk about God sounds hollow and abstract, and for many of us has become uncomfortable and difficult. A frequently proposed way out of this dilemma is to concede that nature, as we experience it and have learned to describe it in science, is indeed autonomous and self-contained, but that God acts in man's history, revealing himself, covenanting with man, rescuing men from the various forms of bondage into which they have fallen. Though nature may be ruled by impersonal iron necessity, history is the realm of freedom and purpose in which values are cherished and ends are pursued; though teleological conceptions may well obstruct and even make impossible the work of the natural scientist, without such categories as purpose and act the historian could not even begin his work. Hence, if God is to be conceived as one who acts, it is in terms of our experience of history that we must understand him: he is one who acts through the events of history as history's Lord. Although in our understanding of nature we are instructed by modern secular science, in our interpretation of history we can be believers. The shallowness of this proposal - though it has often been enunciated in the desperation of contemporary theology - should be immediately apparent. In the first place, no one conceives of or experiences "history" in this kind of sharp isolation from "na- ture." All historical events take place within the context of natural</page><page sequence="4">178 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW process and order, and involve the movements and reordering of physical bodies and material objects of many sorts. Moreover, many natural events - one needs think only of rainfall and drouth, earthquake and disease, birth and death, etc. - have significant historical consequences. It is impossible to speak of history as though it were a realm of freedom and decision entirely separate from nature. Certainly the biblical perspective is not characterized by such nonsense. It is a measure of the desperation of contemporary theology and faith, in the face of the power of the modern scientific world view - a desperation already manifest in Kant's metaphysical agnosticism 3 to which such theological views are heavily indebted - that this way out was attempted at all. It will not do to speak of God as the agent who made it possible for the Israelites to escape from the Egyp- tians, if one regards it as simply a fortunate coincidence that a strong east wind was blowing at just the right time to dry up the sea of reeds. The biblical writer's view is coherent and com- pelling precisely because he is able to say that "the Lord drove the sea back by a strong east wind" (Ex. 14:2 1), i.e., it was be- cause, and only because, God was Lord over nature, one who could bend natural events to his will, that he was able to be effective Lord over history. In the second place - even if the sharp bifurcation of nature and history could be made intelligible - referring acts of God to historical events really helps very little to resolve the funda- mental problem. For the modern experience of and interpretation of history, just as surely as the modern view of nature, is entirely in terms of intramundane powers and events. We may well agree that history is a realm in which decision and action, pursuit of ends and appreciation of value and meaning, have genuine reality and effectiveness; we may be prepared to argue that some mea- sure of genuine freedom and creativity must be presupposed to account for the creation and cumulation of culture, teleologically modifying nature in such diverse ways. But this certainly does not incline many of us to speak of God's free and creative ac- SIt should be recalled here that according to his own testimony in the First Critique KANT had "found it necessary to deny knowledge, in order to make room for faith" (B xxx [Kemp Smith trans.], cf. B xxivff.).</page><page sequence="5">ACT OF GOD 179 tivity in and through the historical process. Indeed, the orien- tation of the modern historian explicitly precludes such extra- worldly reference: his task is to explain and interpret the move- ment of man's history entirely by reference to the interaction of human wills, the development of human institutions and tradi- tions, and the effects of natural events and processes, i.e., exclu- sively in intramundane terms. Doubtless he may refer to historic decisions and to creative ideas and imaginative visions, but these are always the work of human political or military leader, artist or philosopher or dreamer. Never does he invoke a transcendent agent to explain what has occurred and never does he suppose it necessary, or even intelligible, to refer to some injection into the human historical process from beyond in order to understand even the most radical historical reversals or the most creative beginnings: all are to be understood by reference to human powers and actions in the context of the natural world. It is not out of some unbelieving perversity that the modern his- torian thus thinks and writes; rather, since this is the way we in fact experience history, this is the only way in which it is in- telligible to us. Nor is this an attempt to ignore or reduce the mystery of the historical movement in which we are immersed by disregarding its depths and obscurities; few would claim to understand "where history is going" or "the pattern of history." The mystery remains. But it is the mystery and obscurity of human creativity and wilfulness, the mystery and incomprehen- sibility of cosmic process, not the mystery and inscrutability of the purposes and will of a personal and loving God who is moving the world toward a consummation known only to him. Inasmuch as our modern experience and understanding of his- tory is quite as secular as our experience and understanding of nature, the concept, "act of God," can no more readily be in- terpreted by reference to historical events than to natural. But since the root metaphor which informs the western notion of God and gives it its special character is that of a supreme Actor or Agent, it is little wonder that the notion of God has become empty for us, that "God is dead." I An agent is experienced and 'There are, of course, many other contributing factors to contemporary un- belief, e.g., the experience of massive evil in our time. But the problems with</page><page sequence="6">180 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW known in and through his acts; since we no longer grasp events as genuinely acts of the transcendent God, the Agent himself has faded away for us into little more than a word inherited from our past. In this situation three alternatives confront us. The first, and probably most common, is to grant that "God is dead," that is, that life is to be understood in humanistic and natural- istic terms; if the word, "God," is used at all, it will only be in perfunctory and conventional ways, not out of the awareness and conviction of a genuine trans-human agent. The second, followed, for example, by Paul Tillich, is decisively to reinterpret the no- tion of God in such a manner that the conception of agent is no longer implied; then the reality of God will be sought in other di- mensions of experience than "acts." The third, which I shall attempt here, is to subject our ordinary notion of "act" to a re-examination to see whether it is possible to reinterpret the con- ception of "God's act(s)" in a sense to some extent continuous with ordinary usage but nevertheless theologically significant and philosophically intelligible. If the conception of God's "act" can be developed as the fundamental metaphysical category for interpreting his relation to finite beings, the theological task is much facilitated. God himself can be viewed as Agent, one who has intentions and pur- poses which he realizes in and through creation; and thus his creative, providential and redemptive activity can be rendered intelligible in fairly straightforward terms, reasonably continuous with biblical language. Such a defining image of God is not only advantageous when interpreting the heavily anthropomorphic terminology about God's love, mercy, justice and wisdom; it also provides a way to interpret his transcendence,5 thus pre- serving his radical independence and aseity even while making possible an understanding of his relation to the world. Further- more, if it is possible to understand God as an active being in this quasi-personal sense, it is much easier to work out the complex which we are concerned in this paper have a certain logical, if not existential, priority over such difficulties. ' See my two papers, Two Models of Transcendence, in The Heritage of Chris- tian Thought, ed. R. E. Cushman and E. Grislis (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965), and Transcendence without Mythology, Harvard Theological Review 59 (1966), 105-32.</page><page sequence="7">ACT OF GOD 181 metaphysical problems having to do with his relation to other agents, men.6 Conversely, if "act" language is given up in the- ology, or is subordinated to the language of being or cause or process, it becomes very difficult to regard much of the traditional terminology as anything more than poetic metaphor or outright equivocation. II An act (as we ordinarily think of it) is something done or per- formed, a deed; it is a particular and generally a very specific event brought about by an agent. Acts may be of shorter or longer duration (e.g., the act of tying my shoe, or the act of writing this paper), and although an act always has a certain unity governed by the end or objective that is being pursued, it need not be com- pleted in a single unbroken stretch of time but may be interrupted and then resumed (as in the act of building a house or writing a book). But in all cases a particular act has a certain unity and specificity; it is some particular thing achieved, a definite deed done. It is not mere activity, but activity bound together and given a distinct order and structure by the intention of an agent to realize a goal. The goal-seeking which is characteristic of an act must be distinguished from the immanent teleology which Aristotle as- cribed to living organisms. The latter simply follow out patterns built into their very structure and handed on from generation to generation, e.g., the acorn becoming an oak which again pro- duces more acorns. In the case of an act this ruling pattern does not exist: instead, the agent deliberately posits the end which he intends to realize - and it may be something quite new, which had not existed before or which he had not done before. Thus, an act involves an element of creativity not characteristic of lower forms of life than man. The cumulation of such (creative) acts pro- duces the historical order, culture, a new order of being superim- 6 When "act"-language is used in this way to interpret ultimate reality, free- dom and creativity are given significant place on the metaphysical ground floor, in contrast with cosmologies that make either causal or teleological order (or some form of chance or indeterminism) fundamental. Thus, such a position can provide a metaphysical grounding for human freedom and creativity which is simply un- available to other cosmological or theological positions.</page><page sequence="8">182 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW posed on the process of life and not to be simply identified with it. To understand the teleological movements of living organisms, which involve the repetition of unfolding patterns long since es- tablished - the acorn simply becoming another oak - it is neces- sary only to postulate that the same pattern somehow be trans- ferred from generation to generation. The purposive movement of an act, however, inasmuch as it is no mere repetition of pre- vious pattern but involves creative production of the new, cannot be understood in this way. In this case there must be an agent who performs the act, i.e., a reality in which is lodged the teleo- logical intention to be realized through it. Such an agent must be capable both of formulating the intention to be realized in the future (i. e., he must have powers of imagining the presently non- existent) and of working through time in such ordered fashion as to realize his goal. The successive moments of time here are bound together not by a pre-established pattern implanted in the organism but by the purposive activity of the agent. Thus, act and purpose should not be reduced to Aristotle's notion of the teleology at work in all organisms; our proper model here is hu- man purposive behavior. Acts may be broken down or analyzed into constituent acts (or sub-acts) each of which makes its necessary contribution to the larger act. Thus, my act of constructing a bench will include within it many sub-acts of hammering, sawing, measuring, etc. Each of these, involving as it does its own unification of activity toward a particular goal, can be considered an act in its own right. Fastening one board to another is a particular act, but so is driving in each of the nails used to secure that board; and we may, if we choose, regard each blow on the head of a nail as itself a distinct act. But there is a limit below which acts may not be further analyzed into constituent acts. We would not, for ex- ample, regard the movement of the hammer through each separate inch of the path toward the head of the nail as a distinct act; such fractions of activity in which no end, not even a subordinate one, is attained, though essential constituents of the act of hitting the nail, are not themselves acts. To be regarded as an act, the move- ment must realize some posited objective, however slight or un- impressive, e.g., striking the nail. The same sort of rule governs</page><page sequence="9">ACT OF GOD 183 the upper limit of the size and inclusiveness of an act as the lower: so long as the sub-acts are bound together into a single overall teleological unity, we may speak of them as one act. Thus, build- ing a house is a particular act, but it may be viewed as part of the larger act (if done with this larger end in view) of establish- ing a village or even founding a nation. Moreover, several in- dividuals, or even groups, can participate in the same act, if their activity is ordered toward a common end (cf. an "act of Congress"). We would be hesitant, however, about describing the complicated and long historical process of, for example, the rise of science as an act. This is not because of its complexity per se, but because the many constituent events of this develop- ment can hardly be conceived as ordered toward and controlled by some definite end posited by some particular individual or group, i.e., it is difficult to see this process as an act performed by an agent (even a collective agent). Although many acts doubt- less contributed to this development, the peculiar kind of unity to which the term, "act," points, does not characterize the process as a whole. An "act of God," now, in the literal meaning of the phrase, would be a deed performed by God, i.e., an event which did not simply "happen," but which was what it was because God did it.7 Certainly this is the picture of the "mighty acts of God" which we find in scripture. Here God does things just as do men: he enters into battle, he makes covenants with his people, he builds and destroys cities and nations, he cares for the poor and help- less and brings to judgment the wicked, he comforts the afflicted, he causes the sun to shine and the rain to fall, he brings plagues and destruction but also healing and well-being, he has created this very world in which we find ourselves and he will yet create new heavens and a new earth. Each of these is a particular act done by God either simply on his own initiative to further his ends or in response to something done by men. 7 We can still sense something of this meaning even in the conventional or legal usage of the phrase to designate a terrible catastrophe--such as being struck by lightning or destroyed by storm--even though such events are now understood to be due entirely to impersonal natural causes; their unexpectedness, man's powerlessness before them, their terrifying impact on human affairs may still evoke some sense of a powerful and inscrutable will working his way through the events of nature.</page><page sequence="10">184 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW It may be supposed that the difficulty which we moderns feel with such talk of God's acts arises simply and entirely from our being unwilling or unable to think in terms of supernatural causes of historical events. And thus, on the one hand, tradi- tionalists may declaim in the name of faith against what they regard as modern unbelief, while, on the other, secularists will laugh at the naivete of those who suppose God really does some- thing. These contrary positions both arise from the common as- sumption that an act of God is to be thought of as a particular miraculous event which God directly causes,8 and as long as this conception is left undisturbed, the impasse cannot be resolved. In order to do so, it will be necessary both to analyze with more subtlety certain roots of the modern difficulties with the notion of God's acts and also to elaborate more fully some of the im- plications of the previous analysis of an act for the notion of God's act. III The modern difficulties here do not arise exclusively, as is often supposed, from our unwillingness to believe in some trans- cendent cause of events; they arise quite as much from our in- ability to conceive these events themselves, in view of the way in which we (necessarily?) conceive nature and history. In this paper I shall confine myself largely to the second problem, leaving questions about the mode of God's causal impingement on the world for treatment elsewhere." According to the modern view events are not conceived as individual atoms which are more or less independent of the natural sIt may be observed here that though AQUINAS worked out an elaborate doc- trine of "second causes" which he held were the usual media of God's work, he maintained that God could and sometimes did work directly and immediately, and this possibility was regarded by him as theologically indispensable (Summa Theologica, I, Q 0o5), as indeed it is if one works with a theory of second causes like Thomas'. But it is precisely this way of conceiving God's direct and immediate action in particular events that is no longer plausible or intelligible. 9Though I would not be inclined simply to adopt A. N. Whitehead's or Charles Hartshorne's organismic models for rendering intelligible God's impingement on the world, certainly much is to be learned from their careful and detailed treat- ments of this matter. The principal difficulty with them, it seems to me, is that God's effective initiative and autonomous agency are rendered highly problematical, and I am concerned to keep these at the very center.</page><page sequence="11">ACT OF GOD 185 and historical context or web within which they fall. All events are interrelated and interconnected in many complex ways such that to think or to describe any particular event always involves us in reference to those events which preceded it as necessary conditions for its occurring, to those events which surround it and thus specify it by both defining its boundaries or limits and pro- viding the context within which it falls and the background against which it is perceived and known, and to those everwidening circles of events which it will condition and shape in a variety of ways. One of the greatest of Kant's achievements in the First Critique was his demonstration that we not only think in terms of such an interconnected and unified web of events, but that such a unified whole is a necessary condition for having experience at all, i.e., that it would not even be possible to experience totally isolated and unconnected particulars. The success of modern natural science in describing, predicting and in some measure controlling events in the natural order is due precisely to the discovery of ways to discern and formulate fundamental struc- tural regularities obtaining between events (laws of nature); but just this growing success makes it increasingly difficult even to conceive what an event occurring somehow independently of this web might be.'o A similar development has occurred in his- 10E.g., is it even possible, any more, to think clearly what is meant by the "virgin birth"? It might be supposed that this idea is clear enough: it involves conception without the activity of a male partner. But how are we to think of such conception? Are we to suppose that at some point a male sperm appeared within Mary's womb, there fertilizing an egg? If so, how are we to think of this? Were the requisite number of atoms and molecules created instantaneously and out of nothing within Mary's body and somehow infused with life? How is it possible to conceive this in view of the assumptions (indispensable to science) about the conservation of mass-energy, and of the slow evolution of life? If we do not suppose a male sperm was somehow created in Mary's womb, do we think of this conception as without benefit of fertilization at all? Or did the egg fer- tilize itself? I am far from contending that any or all of these questions can be or need be answered; my point is that the way we have come to think of conception and birth under the tutelage of modern biology makes it inevitable that such questions will arise. For we cannot clearly think (though we can, perhaps, imagine) what an event without prior finite causes and conditions would be (and in many cases, as in conception, we know a good deal about what these essential conditions are), and so, no matter at what point in the process of conception and birth we begin, we inevitably and necessarily inquire about the antecedent conditions. The very definition or concept of event implies for us such connection with indis- pensable antecedent (finite) conditions, and it is no longer possible for us to think an "event" as simply supernaturally caused. That is, for us all chains of events, such as the growth of the boy Jesus, presuppose preceding chains of events, such</page><page sequence="12">186 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW torical work. The great achievement of modern history is its success in developing methods of analysis, criticism and evalua- tion of the "sources" with which the historian works, methods that enable the historian to give a wholly satisfactory and con- vincing interpretation of the order and character of the events with which he is dealing without reference to anything beyond the historical process and its natural context. The presupposition of modern historical understanding (as of scientific knowledge) is that each new event emerges out of, and can and must be under- stood in relationship to, the historical context in which it appears. Though it may qualify and transform the future course of that history in significant ways, it never appears within the historical process as an inexplicable bolt from the blue. When a historian has to deal with remains so fragmentary that he is unable to propose a hypothesis about their proper place in the on-going movement of history, he never assumes this was because of some supernatural origin; to do so would imply a conception of breaks in the historical process which would vitiate even the possibility of knowledge of the past. His conclusion (rightly) is that we simply do not have sufficient evidence to say what happened here. But there is no question in his mind (or ours) that if we did have the requisite evidence, we would be able to understand in intra-historical terms the events in question. Not only is secular history written in terms of such assumptions; the whole enter- prise of modern biblical criticism and interpretation proceeds as the development of Mary's pregnancy, and these in turn presuppose other chains; and this continuous recursive movement may not be halted simply ar- bitrarily. The question, then, is whether it is even possible to think clearly the idea of a supernaturally caused event, or (what is the same thing) the occurrence of a finite event without adequate finite causes, or whether such a notion is not quite as self-contradictory as the notion of a square-circle. Cf. SCHLEIERMACHER: "... every absolute miracle would destroy the whole system of nature ... Since . . . that which would have happened by reason of the totality of finite causes in accordance with the natural order does not happen, an effect has been hindered from happening, and certainly not through the influence of other nor- mally counteracting finite causes given in the natural order, but in spite of the fact that all active causes are combining to produce that very effect. Everything, therefore, which had ever contributed to this will, to a certain degree, be an- nihilated, and instead of introducing a single supernatural power into the system of nature as we intended, we must completely abrogate the conception of nature." (The Christian Faith [Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 19281, ? 47, 2.)</page><page sequence="13">ACT OF GOD 187 (quite properly) on the same basis." Without such assumptions about the continuity of the historical process, the analogy of preceding events and periods with our own (secular) experience, and the necessity of criticism of documents, it would not even be possible to think what a historical event is, as Troeltsch long ago clearly perceived.12 It should not be supposed that this modern conception of na- ture and history as a web of interrelated events that must be understood as a self-contained whole is a somewhat arbitrary move, that we could just as well, if we pleased, go back to earlier notions of a much looser weave in the nature of things such that occasionally events without finite cause might appear. The development toward the modern conception was a necessary and natural one fostered by an increasing awareness of the conditions of knowledge and experience; and the tremendous growth of modern scientific and historical knowledge is both its consequence and confirmation. Nor should it be supposed that the discovery of certain indeterminacies on the micro-atomic level opens the door once again to the older conception. I have not been arguing for a (quasi-mechanical) determinism of all events by their antecedents, but rather that the modern pursuit of knowledge presupposes the interrelation and interconnection of all events in an unbroken web. That there may be some measure of "play" or indeterminacy on the atomic level, and that there is genuine creativity and self-determination on the human level, I am quite prepared not only to admit but to argue. But this indeterminacy and this freedom occur within and are continuous with contexts such that statistical descriptions can always be made and are usually quite precise, and (in the case of human actions) under- standing in strictly human terms is demanded. My point is that it is precisely the gradually developing awareness of the inter- connected web of events which has made possible the high-level description and understanding characteristic of modern science " A good recent analysis which shows clearly why this must be the case, as well as how theologians and biblical historians have often sought to evade the full implications of this matter, will be found in VAN A. HARVEY, The Historian and the Believer (New York: Macmillan, 1966). 1 See the essay, Ueber historische und dogmatische Methode in der Theologie, Gesammelte Schriften (Tiibingen: Mohr, 1913), II, 729-53.</page><page sequence="14">188 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW and history. Therefore, it is no longer possible for us to think (when we think clearly and consistently) of individual or par- ticular events somehow by themselves: every event is defined as a focal point in a web that reaches in all directions beyond it in- definitely; 13 it is never grasped (in our modern experience) as an independent substance that can exist and be thought by itself alone. This being the case, we can see why we have great difficulty with the traditional notion of "act of God." This phrase seems to refer to events which have their source or cause directly or immediately in the divine will and action rather than in the con- text of preceding and coincident finite events: indeed, the finite nexus apparently need not be thought as conditioning the newly injected event in any significant way at all, though a chain of consequences within the finite order presumably ensues from it. Acts of God in this sense, seen from man's side, are absolute beginning points for chains of events which occur - not at the "beginning" of the world and history - but within ongoing natural and historical processes. It might be supposed this could be made intelligible through viewing the movement through time of nature and history under the metaphor, for example, of a flowing river, with new streams (acts of God) from time to time emptying into the onward flow, thus becoming part of the cum- ulating rush of waters; but here also, we must remember, such streams can always be traced by a recursive movement to their (finite) sources somewhere back in the hills, precisely what this notion of God's acts renders impossible. I want to emphasize that the problem we are here considering does not arise in the first instance out of difficulties connected with conceiving a transcendent agent; it is rather the difficulty - even impossibil- ity - of conceiving the finite event itself which is here supposed to be God's act. That is, the problem here is not that such acts invoke a no-longer-believable mythology of some being beyond 13 It is, of course, A. N. WHITEHEAD who has worked out most fully both the necessity of conceiving events in this way and also the full cosmological implica- tions of such a conception. (See, e.g., Science and the Modern World [New York: Macmillan, 1925], esp. ch. 7; and the doctrine of "actual occasions" in Process and Reality [New York: Macmillan, 19291.) Without committing oneself to WHITEHEAD'S theology, one may learn much from his ontological and cosmological analysis and construction.</page><page sequence="15">ACT OF GOD 189 this world (however serious that problem may itself be); it is rather that what is said to happen in this world, in our experience, is not intelligible. An "event" without finite antecedents is no event at all and cannot be clearly conceived; "experience" with tears and breaks destroying its continuity and unity could not even be experienced. It is incorrect to suppose, then, that all that is required here is a reformulation of our categories so as to make room for an occasional act of God; the problem is that certain logical preconditions of connection, continuity and unity must obtain if there is to be any experience at all (Kant), and pre- cisely these conditions are contradicted by the notion of par- ticular "acts of God" being performed from time to time in his- tory and nature. Or, to put the matter in a somewhat different way: it is impossible to conceive such an act either as a natural event or as a historical event, i.e., as occurring either within nature or history; in short, it is impossible to conceive it as any kind of event (in the finite order) at all. Our experience is of a unified and orderly world; in such a world acts of God (in the traditional sense) are not merely improbable or difficult to believe: they are literally inconceivable. It is not a question of whether talk about such acts is true or false; it is, in the literal sense, meaningless: one cannot make the concept hang together consistently. IV Having noted certain difficulties for the modern consciousness with the notion that God performs particular more or less indi- vidual acts in history, let us return now to the earlier analysis of act to see whether there are possibilities of reformulation. I will be able to present here only in brief outline a way to conceive God's act in analogy with human acts and yet so as to be not inconsistent with the requirements of modern scientific and his- torical work; many important details, relating both to the (ana- logical) concept of God as Agent and his mode of affecting finite processes, remain to be worked out."4 However, if the proposed '1 For some suggestion of my way of treating some of the problems (though by no means all) connected with conceiving God as Agent see my two papers on personalistic conception of divine transcendence (Two Models of Transcendence, op. cit., and Transcendence without Mythology, op. cit.) Much remains to be</page><page sequence="16">190 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW reconstruction is successful, the (analogical) concept of God's act can be utilized as the fundamental metaphysical category for interpreting his relation to finite reality, i.e., as the form of all his diverse relations to the world, the schema which gives them intelligible unity. If we are going to understand the fullness and diversity of creation in its manifold relations to the one God, we must have a concept which is at once general enough to cover the infinite complexity and manysidedness of those relations and still gives them a sufficiently unified form to be intelligible. I suggest that the notion of act, having the specificity of referring immediately to an agent and yet the generality of comprehend- ing all the relations into which an agent can enter, can provide the basis for developing an analogical concept appropriate to perform this function. Two points particularly must be recalled from the earlier dis- cussion. a) Comprehensive or complex acts may be analyzed or broken down into constituent elements and sub-elements, some of which are themselves simpler acts, some biological or physical processes or motions; or, stated conversely, simple or particular acts are often phases of overarching complex acts - we will call these "master acts" - which unify and order various sorts of behavior and otherwise disconnected stretches of time. b) That which makes an act an act is the deliberate ordering of behavior toward the realization of a previously posited end. I want to argue now that the customary interpretation of particular relatively restricted events - the crossing of the Red Sea, the dispersing of the hosts of Sennacherib, the virgin birth or resurrection of Jesus - as particular acts of God is too simple. For it overlooks the significance of the relation of "simple acts" to "master acts." It is the master act, rather than each simple act taken by it- self, that renders any given piece of activity intelligible. Simple acts, being constituent phases of a complex act, are always sec- ondary and derivative; for they are not performed simply for the sake of their own end but rather as a step toward the master done, however, especially on the problem of conceiving God as effecting his pur- poses within and for history. Resolution of this issue will depend in part on the success with which one is able to conceive how a human agent effects purposes, and then drawing out the analogy to interpret the divine activity.</page><page sequence="17">ACT OF GOD 191 end - the nail is not hammered simply to get it into the board (that is a subordinate objective) but in order to build the house. Doubtless certain subordinate acts must be performed in order to complete the complex act, but they have their purpose and gain their character from the latter, and we can be said to "under- stand" them only when we see them in the light of the master end. Thus, we do not find it particularly illuminating to say simply, "The carpenter is driving nails," for that in itself is hardly mean- ingful activity; rather, it is when we see that the carpenter is nailing together boards in order to construct a house that we understand what he is doing. If we are to understand properly the phrase, "act of God," then, we should use it first of all to designate the master act in which God is engaged, not the particular and relatively limited events which might first attract our attention. The latter must be regarded as secondary and derivative, to be grasped and in- terpreted in the light of God's master end, not in their own terms. This means (for a monotheistic theology) that it is the whole course of history, from its initiation in God's creative activity to its consummation when God ultimately achieves his purposes, that should be conceived as God's act in the primary sense. In the biblical documents God is not portrayed as one who per- forms relatively disconnected and unrelated acts not leading in any particular direction or toward any definite goal; he is one who planned "the end from the beginning" (Isa. 46:Io), and his activity throughout history is ordered toward his ultimate goal, the final establishment of that "kingdom which has been destined for [his creatures] from the creation of the world" (Mt. 25:34 Goodspeed). Even the appearance of Jesus Christ far down the course of history "was destined before the foundation of the world" (I Pet. 1:20), and what he brought into history is to be understood as but a foretaste or anticipation of the final glorious consummation. The movement of history as portrayed in the Bible is no mere succession of events - not even a succession of "acts of God" - leading to no clear goal or end: from its begin- ning and throughout, it is given shape and direction by the ulti- mate objective which God is bringing to pass. Since, as we ob-</page><page sequence="18">192 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW served previously, activity proceeding from a single agent and ordered toward a single end, no matter how complex, is properly to be regarded as one act, this whole complicated and intricate teleological movement of all nature and history should be regarded as a single all-encompassing act of God, providing the context and meaning of all that occurs. It is, of course, an act that has not yet run its course, an act that will not be finished until the eschaton. This conception of God's master act does not run into the same difficulties with the modern presuppositions about the unity and structure of nature and history as did the notion of various rel- atively independent act-events. For here God's act is not a new event that suddenly and without adequate prior conditions rips inexplicably into the fabric of experience, a notion consistent neither with itself nor with the regularity and order which ex- perience must have if it is to be cognizable. Rather, here God's act is viewed as the source of precisely that overarching order itself: it is God's master act that gives the world the structure which it has and gives natural and historical processes their direction. Speaking of God's act in this sense in no way threatens the unity and order of the world as a whole."5 It is meaningful to regard the fundamental structures of nature and history as grounded in an act (of God), however, only if we are able to think of them as developing in time. An act is in- trinsically temporal: it is the ordering of a succession of events toward an end. If we could not think of the universe as somehow developing in unidirectional fashion in and through temporal processes, it would be mere poetry to speak of God's act. For this reason, prior to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, while a static-structural view of nature prevailed, it was very 1" JoHN MACMURRAY even argues that the "only way" in which we can con- ceive the world as a unified whole is by thinking it as "one action" (The Self as Agent [London: Faber &amp; Faber, I9571, 204). For if the overarching unity of the world were conceived simply in terms, for example, of the category process, it would be "a world in which nothing is ever done; in which everything simply happens; a world, then, in which everything is matter of fact and nothing is ever intended. We should have to assert, in that case, that there are no actions; that what seem such are really events" (219). That is, the concept of process cannot comprise the unity of the entire world because it cannot contain our own actions as part of that overall unity.</page><page sequence="19">ACT OF GOD 193 difficult to think of nature as ordered by God's act in any further sense than being created (and sustained) by him. But a scien- tific revolution occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: geologists began to see the earth not as a more or less static given, but as having a history through which it developed through many ages to its present form; biologists came to see life not merely as a structure of species, but as a unitary evolutionary process in continuous development from lower forms to highly complex ones; and astronomers even discovered that the supposed- ly eternally stable heavens actually manifested a continuously ex- panding movement through billions of years, seeming to go back to some primeval originating "explosion." In short, scientists came to think of nature, in all her levels and forms, as in his- torical process, as moving and developing and evolving in time. Thus, to conceive the whole cosmic movement as comprehended within a single "act" through which God is achieving some ulti- mate purpose is consistent with the modern understanding of nature as in process of evolutionary development."6 It will be objected immediately that science finds no evidence of teleological or purposed order in this movement, that the most which can be observed is simply a kind of natural evolu- tion. With this I will not quibble: I am not claiming here that the cosmic process provides evidence for believing in a God ac- tive through it; I am claiming merely that the evolutionary pic- ture of nature and life currently painted in our scientific knowl- edge is not inconsistent with such belief. The purpose that in- forms an act is an interior connection between the various phases of events known to the agent who is performing it, and is seldom directly visible to external observers, especially to those who can see only a tiny fraction of the total act in question. If God is acting through the process of nature's development over bil- lions of years to accomplish some ultimate objective, this would hardly be apparent in the observations of lowly men, with a life- span of a mere three score years and ten and careful scientific 1 It is not consistent, of course, with the assumption that nature is not grounded in anything beyond herself; but that is a different point from the one I am making in this paper, and one which deserves full discussion in its own right, though it cannot be pursued here.</page><page sequence="20">194 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW observations and records going back at most only a few hundred years. To use a geometrical figure: one could hardly expect man to discern the teleological curvature of the movement of world history as a whole when he has accessible to his direct inspection scarcely more than an infinitesimal arc of that curve. Such teleological activity by a cosmic agent could be known only if he should in some way choose to reveal it to his creatures.7 Thus, to conceive the entire movement of nature and history as the expression of one overarching act of God is consistent both with the meaning of the term, "act," and with the modern understanding of the cosmos as in evolutionary development. True, no evidence has been offered here to sustain such a view of an ultimate teleology working in nature, and I do not propose in this paper to offer any. That would involve us in an examina- tion of the grounds, psychological, historical and logical, for be- lief in God, and it would require sketching out doctrines of God and of revelation. In short, it would lead far beyond the scope of the present inquiry. We are concerned here with the very restricted objective of clarifying and reinterpreting the notion of God's act in such a way that it will be intelligible in the light of current scientific and historical assumptions about the inter- connectedness of all events. Unless this can be done, all speech about God as "Lord" of the world, as providentially guiding his- tory, as loving and merciful father of mankind, as active agent in any significant sense at all --speech that is essential for Christian and Jewish faith - is hollow and empty, whatever be one's grounds for believing in God. Both the present sort of analysis (dealing with God's relation to the world) and explora- tion of the wider question of the grounds for speaking of God at all will be required if the highly problematic status which all such talk presently has is to be overcome. '71 cannot here go into the complicated question of whether God has revealed himself and, if so, how this is to be understood. Suffice it to recall that precisely this is the Christian claim: the knowledge of God and of his purposive activity in and for the world is not attained primarily through observation of nature but rather through his self-disclosure. "For he has made known to us in all wisdom and insight the mystery of his will, according to his purpose which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth" (Eph. 1:9-1o).</page><page sequence="21">ACT OF GOD 195 V Having proposed an interpretation of "act of God" in its pri- mary and widest meaning, as designating the overall movement of nature and history toward God's ultimate goal, it is necessary to return in conclusion to the more customary understanding of the phrase as referring to particular events in which God does something "unusual" or "special" in history. Is this ordinary meaning of the phrase to be ignored or dispensed with entirely? Is it not such particular acts in which faith believes and for which prayer cries rather than a cosmological overview? Have we not so transformed - and, some might say, "watered down" - the meaning of God's activity as to render it religiously irrelevant or empty? To these questions two remarks may be addressed. (i) The question whether the phrase, "act of God," can have any ref- erential meaning at all is primarily intellectual or theoretical. In saying this I do not mean to ignore or disparage religious or ex- istential aspects of this problem, for they are also there; but the principal difficulty here is that our understanding of the world, of experience, of history, has become such that there seems no way to conceive or imagine cosmic purposive activity working in events. That is, it is the theory informing all our experience and thought that appears radically inconsistent with that older personalistic (or anthropomorphic) theory of the world which everywhere informs the biblical literature and our most funda- mental theological conceptions. Unless this problem of theory, of conceptualization, of the basic categories of experience can be re- solved, we are condemned either to live in an intolerable tension between our religious language and life and the rest of experi- ence - a tension always threatening to disintegrate and destroy both the self and its faith - or to give up Christian faith and talk as outmoded and no longer relevant to the actual structures of our lives and world. It is a problem in theory, then, which we must address here, and it should not surprise us if the treatment of that problem will be, in the first instance, theoretical. We must find some way to think about the world once again with the categories of act and purpose if we wish to continue using these</page><page sequence="22">196 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW categories to speak of God and his relations to men. I freely admit, therefore, that I am proposing here a rather theoretical understanding of the notion of God's act. The principal point I have tried to emphasize in this paper is that it is no longer possible for us to view the events in nature and history as relatively independent occurrences, each to be perceived and interpreted more or less in its own terms; for us the world has become a unified whole such that particular events are always experienced and understood in terms of their struc- tural connections with the rest of experience, as described and clarified by scientist and historian. The order or structure of the whole thus has a kind of precedence, with us, over any par- ticular happening, and we are inclined to discount even our own immediate experience - e.g., to regard it as hallucinatory - if it cannot be understood in terms of that underlying and omnipres- ent order. In the more loosely textured world of earlier genera- tions particular "acts of God" could be experienced and accepted more or less in their own terms, no matter how extraordinary they might appear, for who could say what character a new event might have? In our tightly structured world it is necessary to find place for God's activity in the fundamental order of things before it is even possible to speak meaningfully of his acting in particular events, for the conception of the latter and the very criteria with the aid of which we perceive and interpret them is derivative from and dependent upon our understanding of the basic order. Hence, if we are to speak of particular acts of God at all, we must first learn to speak of his act in and through the structure and movement of the whole. It is precisely a way of conceiving that act which is proposed in this paper. (2) This proposal of theory, however, opens up once again a way to understand the notion of particular acts of God of more limited scope. These are not to be regarded (as in the traditional mythology) as more or less spur-of-the-moment decisions in which God does something in history in quite unexpected and inexplica- ble fashion: they should be understood (quite consistently with the eschatological orientation of much biblical, and all New Testament, thought) as functions of and subordinate steps toward God's ultimate goal. The master act of God (which he has not yet</page><page sequence="23">ACT OF GOD 197 completed) is the temporal movement of all nature and history toward the realization of his original intention in creation. This complex act comprises many events and processes of all sorts as its constituent phases and elements. Some of these, themselves teleologically ordered toward certain subordinate ends or goals which are necessary steps toward the master end, may quite prop- erly be regarded as (subordinate) acts or sub-acts performed by God as he works out his purpose: a master act (as we earlier noted) is usually made up of a variety of subordinate acts. Assuming (on the basis of Christian claims) that God has revealed something of his purposes for man and the world, it is possible to discern, with the help of modern knowledge of nature and history, some of the stages (sub-acts) through which the created order has moved as God has gradually been performing his master act. The creation of the solar system, the emergence of life here on earth, the evolution of higher forms of life and finally man - each of these (as well as many other natural processes and events) represents an indispensable step toward the realization of God's ultimate objectives for creation. Further- more, the crucial phases of the actual movement of human history, and the emergence of Heilsgeschichte within that history, can be regarded as further subordinate acts of God, e.g., the beginnings of agriculture and later of civilization, the development of in- creasingly complex and interdependent modes of social, political and economic organization making possible differentiation and specialization in socio-cultural life, the emergence of primitive religious cultus and conceptions (especially in the Near East) providing a background against which faith in Yahweh could ap- pear. Such specific events of quite limited scope as the remark- able escape of a few Hebrew tribes from Egyptian slavery, the creation of the Israelite kingdom under Saul and David, and the later exile and return of the inhabitants of Judah are acts through which God moved human history and consciousness toward a fuller awareness of who he is and what his purposes for creation are. Within this sequence, the ministry and death of Jesus Christ can quite properly be understood as the supreme act through which God at once made himself known to man and began a radical transformation of man according to his ultimate purposes</page><page sequence="24">198 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW for man. Events in other cultural histories and the more recent events in western history may all in this way be seen as gov- erned or guided by the activity through which God is moving the whole of creation toward the eschaton, as subordinate acts within God's master act.18 Thus, the whole course of history (including the history of nature and the evolution of life) can be apprehended once again as under God's providential control. This does not mean, of course, that every natural or historical event need be or should be regarded as a distinct sub-act of God; only those events which move the creation forward a further step toward the realization of God's purposes could prop- erly be so designated. There are many natural processes, for example, which, though originally set in motion by God's crea- tive activity, now function as fundamental rhythms or orders which support and sustain the more complex processes of the teleological movement, thus giving the world a certain constancy and structure. It would hardly be appropriate to regard the continuing steady functioning of such processes as new "acts of God"; they are, rather, the product of his earlier (creative) work, still sustained by him no doubt, but now serving as the (relatively completed) foundation on which he can build as yet unrealized superstructures. Furthermore, when certain finite pro- cesses evolved through the various stages of life to the level of conscious and free behavior, the purposive activity of finite agents 18It will be evident from this description that God's act must not be con- ceived under only one image of activity, e.g., the carpenter making a table or the farmer cultivating a field or the parent educating his child. Within the schema of God's act we are including: (a) his creation and maintenance of the material orders of nature, and also his ordering them in such a way that life can emerge from them; (b) his creation of life and his ordering it through an evolutionary process in which higher and more complex forms gradually emerge from lower and simpler forms, ultimately producing self-conscious life; and (c) his creation of the culture-producing being, man, his guidance of man's historical development so as to make possible the emergence of a genuinely free and responsible being, and his dealing with free (and sinful) man in such a way as to redeem him from his self-imposed bondage and enable him to become what had been originally in- tended. Obviously the forms of "act" appropriate to all the diverse forms of finite being here represented--ranging from bare matter to free spirits--and appropriate to the objectives God is seeking to accomplish with each will be quite various, and it would be a gross error in our theological construction if we attempted to assimilate them all to one form of (human) act, e.g., that of man the maker. It is essential that we develop our analogies from the full range of human activities if we are going to render God's relation to his world in- telligible by means of the basic schema, act.</page><page sequence="25">ACT OF GOD 199 began to appear within the historical process. Inasmuch as these acts in and of themselves, even though teleological in form, had (and have) their sources and goals within the finite order itself, they are not necessarily to be considered as direct sub-acts of God. Indeed, they could and often did (and do) go counter to God's purposes and acts, as with man's falling into cumulating patterns of sin. On the Christian view, perhaps only once in his- tory - the march of Jesus to the cross - has there been a direct one-to-one correspondence and coincidence of human activity with divine. Only those natural and historical events which di- rectly advance God's ultimate purposes - i.e., those which are essential constituent phases or steps of God's master act - may properly be regarded as (subordinate) acts of God within nature and history. This understanding of God's subordinate acts does not in any way undermine or threaten the unified and structural character of experience, or the methods or conclusions of science and his- tory. For between particular events and overarching structures and continuities, the same formal relationship obtains in the theological interpretation as in that of modern history or science: in all these cases the particular is seen in the context of, and/or as a phase of, a more comprehensive whole. Of course, the theo- logical view posits a teleological movement in that whole which is not discernible to the naked scientific eye, but this eschatological goal in which faith believes does not itself disclose to faith the complex of particular historical steps through which God must move to achieve his end; man becomes aware of these only a posteriori, as creation gradually moves onward through its his- torical course and man learns to discern the several phases of that movement in his science and history. There is here, then, place both for the most rigorous application of scientific and historical methods to the analysis and interpretation of (past) experience and also for faith that the temporal movement of the whole, in- cluding the particular developments of our individual lives, is under God's providential care. It must be admitted that the doctrine of providence here en- tailed is more austere than the pietistic views often found in Christian circles. God's subordinate acts here are governed</page><page sequence="26">200 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW largely by his overarching purposes and ultimate objectives, not simply by the immediate needs or the prayerful pleas of his children. This is no God who "walks with me and talks with me" in close interpersonal communion, giving his full attention to my complaints, miraculously extracting me from difficulties into which I have gotten myself by invading nature and history with ad hoc rescue operations from on high. This is the Lord of heaven and earth, whose purposes we cannot fully fathom and whose ways are past finding out (Rom. I1:33). "It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers" (Isa. 40:22). His thoughts are not ours, and our ways are not his (Isa. 55:8). He has brought this world into being for his own reasons, he is moving it through a history in accordance with his own objectives, and he shall accomplish his purposes when the eschaton comes. Doubtless we men, both as species and individuals, have place within those purposes, and certain of his sub-acts are responsive to our acts; in this we can rejoice, finding meaning for our lives and comfort for our souls. But the place we have is his to determine and assign, not our own; at the very most our lives are but almost infinitesimal constituents in his all-comprehending act, and his responsiveness to the par- ticularities of our activity must be understood as a function and phase of his master act ordering all human and cosmic history. Though faith grounded on the conviction that in Christ God has disclosed his true nature and will may trust confidently until the end that he will deal with us justly and with love, we should hardly expect that he can or will bend his cosmic activity much to meet our private and peculiar needs or wishes. Indeed, it is precisely this steadfastness in his own purposes that makes him the faithful God: who could entrust himself to one who changed course with every turn in the breeze? Christian piety has too long been nurtured largely on those psalms and other biblical materials which portray God as a kind of genie who will extricate the faithful from the difficulties into which they fall; it is this erratic and fickle God who cannot be reconciled with the modern understanding of the order in nature and history. Far better would it be to nourish our piety on the paradigmatic Christian story: a man praying that this cup might</page><page sequence="27">ACT OF GOD 201 pass from him, but submitting his will to God's, no matter what the consequences; that prayer answered not with legions of angels to rescue him but with lonely suffering on a cross, culmin- ating in a cry of despair before the moment of death - and then a resurrection of new life, new faith, new hope, new love, in a new community born after his death. The God who works in this fashion to turn the darkest despairs and defeats into further steps toward the realization of his beneficent ultimate objectives, without violently ripping into the fabric of history or arbitrarily upsetting the momentum of its powers, is one who can also be conceived as working steadily within and through the closely textured natural and historical processes of our modern experi- ence: he is a God who acts, a living God, the adequate object for a profound faith, and his action is not completely unintelligible to a mind instructed and informed by modern science and history.</page></plain_text>
