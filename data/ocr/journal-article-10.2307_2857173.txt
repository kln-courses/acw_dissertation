Alberti s intentionwas not only to give a theory g t for practice but also to integrate architecture with a broad interpretation of the new humanist culture. The treatise, begun sometime in the I440S and substantially completed by I450, begins where his della pittura of I43 5 had left off; it therefore be- longs to that fertile period in his career before he had endulged in the actual practice of architecture. Still primarily a man of letters, it was to other humanists that he addressed himself and to other humanists that he must have owed his primary debt.1 From the very first Alberti consistently emphasizes a broad role for the architect. He must deal with design in a natural world and he must satisfy social requirements with his design. In the Preface to the treatise Alberti states: Him I call an architect who, 6y an admira61e and intelligent theory and method is a61e to devise with thought and invention and to complete through execution 6y means of tlle movement of great weights, and the conjunction and amassment of 60dies, all those works which can, with the greatest 6eauty, 6e adapted to the uses of mankind: and to 6e a61c to do this he must llave a thorough insight into the no61est and most . . curlous SClenCes.&lt; 1 For the extent to which architectural design was not exclusively the concern of archi- tects see two important new studies: Ernst Gombrich, 'The Early Medici as Patrons of Art', Italian Renaissance Studies, ed.

I [61 ]</page><page sequence="2">62 ALBERTI AND THE HUMANIST ARCHITECT There is much here from Vitruvius, but Alberti's departure from Vitru- vius' definition, not his obvious debt, should be emphasized.3 Alberti transposed Vitruvius' method of design, based on what the ancient theorist had called ratio, to 'an admirable and intelligent theory' and then added a method which was also admirable and intelligent. To the general demand of antiquity that the arts be produced by reason Alberti adds the demand that thought, or continuing intellectual process, be the guide for the architect.4 Alberti's definition of the bui]ding is also new. It is a kind of 60dy consisting, like all other 60dies, of design and of matter; the first is produced 6y thought, the other 6y nature; so that tlle one is to 6e provided 6y the application and the colltrivance of the mind, and the other 6y due preparation and choice.5 Again Alberti departs from ancient thought, most importantly from that of Vitruvius' stoicism. He knew that the stoics, as Seneca had ex- plained, had recognized only one cause through which matter assumed a form or an order, and that was the maker. Seneca rejected Aristotelian and Platonic positions and proposed that the real cause of form in a work 'is surely Creative Reason in other words, God'. ('Ratio scilicet faciens, id est deus.')6 The first part of one of Seneca's examples would have served as the complete example for Vitruvius' entire simple-mind- ed system: In order to produce or cause a statue, bronze is given form by the artist. Alberti disagreed. Material does not come to the architect without some previous form; the artist is not the first to give form to the material he works with. Alberti's Renaissance architect enters the wish to express my gratitude to Professor Paul Oskar Kristeller for his help in adapting the translations, and to him and to Professor Rudolf Wittkower for their generous assist- ance during the preparation of an earlier version of this study. 3 See Richard Krautheimer, 'Alberti and Vitruvius', Acts ofthe XXth Congress oftlle His- tory of Art, II: The Renaissance and Mannerism, ed. M. Meiss, Princeton, I963, pp. 42-52. (This volume will be cited in future as XXth Congress.) 4 P. 0. Kristeller has pointed out that according to the ancients an art can be taught and learned.

Alberti's insistence on the peculiar virtu of the artist marks the artist as unique, a distinctly modern concept. 5 De re aed., Preface, I 5. 6 Seneca, Ad Lucilium epistolae moYalesX ed. and trans. by R.

WESTFALL 63 world of nature at a later stage, so to speak, when material already has a natural form and would continue to have it so long as Creative Reason or God effects it. To use material meant that the artist reforms it, and that is a diff1cult process which in itself requires the continued effort of the architect's intellect. Alberti explained that to give form to matter is a process which has three elements: the mind designs, the hand operates on material, and nature supplies the qualities of'heaviness, lightness, thickness, clearness, durability, etc.'7 The operations of these three elements are clearly in- terdependent, and the operations of the mind are superior to those of the hand and will be successful only if they work in conjunction with the operations of nature. The operation of the mind is the chief part of designing in architec- ture, and Alberti carefully explained how the architect proceeds. We can in our thought and intelligence contrive perfect forms of 6uildings entirely separate from matter 6y settling and regulating a certain disposition and conjunction of tlle angles and lines.8 The perfect forms he mentions here are pure geometric shapes found especially in nature; they are not forms freely invented in the mind. Alberti explains that 'it is manifest that nature delights principally in round figures, since we find that most things which are generated, made, or directed by nature are round.'9 Nature also favors figures of six sides, the shape in which bees and other wasps fashion their hives.10 Nature works with straight lines and also with curves;1l the geometric shapes in a building must be regular and even because they are so in nature;12 and arches should be parts of pure circles if they are to be strong.l3 Historians have invented a source other than nature for Alberti's per- fect forms, and this raises a point which will be examined below. A1- berti himselfnamed two more sources beyond nature. One of these was the building remains of antiquity.

The second source of perfect forms was the works of painters. Painters he called 'those most accurate searchers after everything that is beautiful'; their works may contribute elements of beauty and of ornament to the architect's works.l5 It is clear from della pittura that painters searched for their forms in nature, so to take from painters was again to take from nature, although rather indi- rectly. On the whole, however, antiquities and painters' works make rather vague and unsatisfactory contributions; Alberti stresses the role of nature because the most important parts of design derive directly from God's, not from man's, works. In proceeding with designing, the perfect forms must be rationalized for adaptation or imposition upon material during construction, be- cause 'architecture as a whole consists of design (lineamenta) and con- struction (structura)'.16 In a long passage Alberti shows how as he de- signs he gradually modifies his first ideas as he takes material and their natural qualities into account.l7 As a guide in this process Alberti intro- duced three so-called principles of design and one allusive and extremely important overriding criterion. These elements fill out his definition of the process of design and provide the fundamental principles for the creation of beauty in architecture. The three principles are number, finishing, and collocation; their meaning and sources are described in book IX. Alberti defines number as the correct or appropriate quantity of elements based on correspond- ences to what is found in nature. Animals, for example, move on an even number of feet and have an uneven number of apertures; a build- ing, therefore, should have an even number of supports and an uneven number of entrances and exits. Several other numbers, such as five, sev- en, nine, and forty, are particularly favored by nature; five embodies the ternary principle, seven represents the number of planets, and nine 14 G. C.

WESTFALL 65 the number of spheres. Forty is a ninth part ofthe days ofthe year, more or less. Six is especially favored because like any natural object it con- sists of nothing but its own parts. Six is the number of sides of the hexa- gon which, according to the philosophers, is like a circle in that a circle is all angles and the hexagon's side is the radius of a circle. The number six, the hexagon, and the circle are interchangeable; some geometric forms and simple numbers can be used interchangeably in architectural designs just as they are found to be interchangeable in nature.18 Alberti cited these philosophers' opinions and thereby left nature to enter another source for the remaining principles of design, finishing, and collocation.19 Finishing is Alberti's term for 'a certain mutual cor- respondence of those several lines by which the proportions are meas- ured' in their length, breadth, and height. Finishing controls number and means proportions in the three dimensional space of the building. Proportions explicitly have their source in philosophy rather than in na- ture, although natural objects and events do show a constant analogy to one another in that they are all proportioned. Musicians (that is, prac- ticing philosophers) who delight our ears with numerical, proportionate relationships of sounds supply the architect with proportions which will delight our eyes. The third principle, collocation, 'which relates to the situation and position of the parts' of a lDui]ding one to another, receives little explanation because it is a factor which depends primarily upon the vzrtu or the innate ability of the architect rather than upon the soundness of his method or the extent of his lear1ling.20 The ancient ar- chitect was in a position to learn rules of art because he came from the upper classes. The Renaissance architect, however, had to receive his potcntial abilities at birth, and these abilities could only be refined by educatic)n. He must be innately able to collocate the properties of archi- tecture, the principles of nature, and the principles of philosophy, and to bring them into an ordered relationship to o1le another.21 Collocation is the innate ability of the architect to put things together. Alberti's ideas about numbering, finishing, and collocation are more complex than his ideas about the perfect forms because on the former Alberti bases the fundamental duty ofthe architect: he must satisfy social 18 De re aed., I.viii.s7-sg; vrI.iv.ssI; and IX.V.8Ig f. 19 De re aed., IX.V.8Io fE., and developed in subsequent chapters.

Alberti said that number, finishing, and collocation are those 'three things in which consist the foundation of beauty'. 'But there is something further,' he states, wliich arises from all tllese when tlley are put togetller and joined and 6y wllich the whole appearance and 6eauty is wondcrfully illumined. This we call collcinnitas wllicl we say is tlle product of grace and decoru1n. Yet it is the task and function of concinnitas to compose 6y a perfect proportion tlle parts rvllich 6y nature are otherwise separate in such a way that they mutually correspond to tileir kind.22 Concinnitas, which might be translated congruity, is intrinsic to bodies of nature and to the members of those bodies; especially important is that conctnnttas is a part of every action of man's life and of every pro- duction of nature.23 Concttlnttas is an extension of collocation in that it brings together the intentions and abilities of the architect and the in- tentions and achievements of God in creation and of man in society. Through his concern with concinnitas the architect enters society. After having dispatched the process of design in the first three books (with its amplification in book IX), Alberti moves on to discuss society and its buildings and the architect's production of beauty, the last two topics of the treatise. In the Preface Alberti had said that architecture is not only 'inexpressibly delightful' but is also 'of the greatest convenience to mankind in all respects, both public and private; and in dignity not inferior to the most excellent [arts].' The social purposes of architecture, or the functional purposes of a building, are determined by social re- quirements, not by the architect alone.24 In books IV and v Alberti wrote much less in the role of an architect than in that of a humanist; he did, indeed, discuss practical points, but rather than solve problems as 22 De re aed., IX.V.8I5. E. Panofsky, Idea, contributo a//a storia de//'estetica, trans. Ed- mondo Cione, Florence, I952, p. 32, n. I2s(a), cites this passage as an expression of Pla- tonism or of the doctrine of Plotinus. The next passage, in which Alberti defines orna- ment, he calls Ciceronian, citing the de natura deorum, I, 79. Giovanni Santinello, Leon Battista Alberti, una visione estetica del mondo e della vita, Florence, I962, pp. 224-228, says the concept of concinnitas is based on Cicero and rhetoric; he recognizes the Platonic ele- ment, p. 232. He also correctly recognizes the central importance of concinnitas, and the deepening of the concept of beauty between books VI and IX; see pp. 228-238. 23 De re aed., IX.V.8I5. 24 Alberti's concept of the history of architecture also placed tremendous emphasis on function as a qualitative standard. As Krautheimer outlines Alberti's history of architec- ture: 'an architecture of mass (firmitas) born in Asia merges in Greece with grace (venus- tas), and finally, in Rome, with usefulness (utilitas).' Op. cit., p. 48. Utility achieves great- er importance than the other two factors because it is Roman and because it shows a higher achievement by man, since it took the mind of man the longest to contrive satis- faction for utility's demands.</page><page sequence="7">CARROLL W. WESTFALL 67 an architect he listed specifications and requirements as if he were a com- missioner outlining a building program for an architect. When, how- ever, in the next set of books, books VI through IX, he takes up the next topic, he spcaks more specifically from an architect's point of view. The next topic is beauty itself as an independent attribute of a build- ing. It is a complex subject in which Alberti must eventually incorporate the material of the two previous sections, as he states explicitly in the in- troduction to book VI. He lists three properties which all buildings must satisfy; the first two ofthese, that they be 'stout and strong for duration' (ad perpetuitatem firmissima) and 'that they be accommodated to their respective purposes' (ad usum apta) he has already discussed. With these two conditions he has finished discussing the architect's personal role in designing buildings and of society in creating demands for particular buildings and can now move on to discuss beauty. The third condition requires that building;s be 'pleasant and delightful to the sight' (ad gratiam et amoe1litatem paratissima).25 He first casts about for the proper word for and definition of beauty. In Vitruvius he found no satisfaction because the ancient architect had defined each term with more terms, and then arrived at the three condi- tions of strength (firmitatis), utility (utilitatis), and grace (venustatis).26 Alberti accepted all three conditions (although he substituted the term aptum for utilitatis), but at the third condition he balked. Grace is assured, Vitruvius had written, 'when the appearance of the work is pleasing and in good taste, and when its members are in due proportion according to correct principles of symmetry.'27 This concept of grace or beauty included neither durability nor social usefulness; it did not indi- cate that beauty incorporated the previous two conditions within the third. Thus Alberti abandoned Vitruvius' definition of beauty and with it his terminology. He replaced his own meek 'pleasant and delightful to the sight' with the forthright term beauty (and ornament pulchri- tudino et ornamentum), and he proceeded with his definitions. In book VI he defined beauty in the individual building: it is a 'har- 25 De re aed., VI.i.445 26 Vitruvius, de arc11itettura, ed. and trans. F. Granger, 2 vols., New York and London, . . .

Each topic is a separate subject. He is still writing about the building and its parts, not about allusive concinnitas, although concin- nitas is a factor in the definition of beauty he is developing here. Finally he comes, as he says, 'once more to those points which I had promised to inquire into, narnely, wherein it is that beauty and orna- ment universally considered, consist, or rather, whence they arise.'31 How does an intellect produce beauty; what is 'that property . . . which in its nature makes a thing beautiful'?32 That property is concinnitas; it guides nature as ske produces beauty; it had earlier been defined as guid- ing every action of man's life. Cozlcinnitas, then, can only refer to the architect's method of inte;rating social demands and the design proce- dure which uses perfect forms, material, number, finishing, and colloca- tion. Concinllitas is the archway over the gateway to beauty universally considered; its twin supports are natural materials and social require- ments. In subjecting natural material to beauty the architect is brought into direct confrontation for good or for bad with nature, which in Alberti's thought was best represented by good and bad Fortune. In a short dia- logue written just before he began de re aediJScatoria, Alberti explained that man is affected personally by Fortune and that Fate is a collective term for Fortune as she affects society or the affairs of men.33 Fortune 28 De re aed., VI.ii.447. 29 As Orlandi points out in his note 3 to this passage, the definition is similar to Cicero's in Orator, I49, I64 f.; and Brutus, 287, 325; see also for a resume of sources cited for this passage, J.

Great masses of bodies which have great weight are dii1- cult to deal with, but he CAll prove his understanding of design and his control of Fortune when he moves and manipulates them with facility.35 Buildings are continually subjected to hostile natural forces some of which arise frotn defects of design, others of which are inherent in na- ture. None of these defects is 'incapable of being corrected'.36 Time is a subject of Fortune; it is a property of nature which gradually allows natural forces the heat of the sun, damps, frosts, winds to operate on the material of natural objects.37 Time, which in dellafiamiglia Alberti had called a cosa preziosissima, could also be the architect's ally.38 In de re aediticatoria he emphasized the importance of careful consideration of design over a period of time, for time was the architects chief critic.39 If man overcomes Fortune he will acquire riches and, more impor- tantly, as Petrarch in the more austere fashion of tlle trecento had taught Alberti, fame and heavenly virtue.40 The practice of the liberal arts con- trols the destructive elements of Fortune operating through time and in nature a1ld makes them useful to mankind.41 A vainglorious liberal ar- tist will only produce disaster; an architect is neither to perform his work with the desire for empty, earthly glory, nor to work with a pa- 34 Alberti had spelled out the choice quite clearly in the prologue to I Libri della famig- lia, ed. Cecil Grayson (Opere volgari, I), Bari, I960. 35 Alberti's concept of engineering derived from his interpretation of nature as an or- dered, geometric system; structural forms were solid when regular and they were made regular through perspectival methods. The concept had been pioneered by Brunelleschi. See tor this concept in general: P. Sanpaolesi, La cupola di Santa Maria del Fiore: II pro- getto, la costruzione, Rome, I94I; the same, 'Ipotesi sulle conoscenze matematiche, statiche e mecchalliche del Brunelleschi', Belle Arti (I95I), 457-554; and, for the difSer- ences between the Florentine system of'perspective engineering' and north Italian and north European engineering in this period, J.

The architect will achieve fame by means of careful design, proper choice, and conscien- tious execution; to conquer Fortune with a sure intellectual method is to acquire timeless fame. Partial evidence of successful conquest is the dur- able, useful, and beautiful building. The problem of durability and of natural materials was of no concern in Alberti's previous artistic treatise, della pittura, because the painter did not work with natural material but only with its appearance in objects. The other support of the gateway to beauty, social requirements, was the main concern ofthat treatise. Because de re aedificatoria grewnaturally out of della pittura, it is essential to recapitulate here briefly some of its most salient points.43 Alberti offered timeless fame to the man who wisely and conscien- tiously exercises the liberal art of painting if his innate virtu equips him for its practice. The intellectual foundation of painting is perspective. The painter uses perspective to examine natural objects mathematically and intellectually and then to represent them objectively on a painted surface; from poets painters obtain subjects for istorie which are the painter's highest products and are to move the observer from vice to virtue. Since it is more important for the painter to produce a convinc- ing representation of a didactic allegory than a precise, perspectival representation of natural objects, perspective is more important as a theoretical, scientific foundation for painting than it is as a tool used by the painter. The architect, on the other hand, uses perspective to investigate na- ture; witllout it, he would be unable to discover those important perfect forms. Since Alberti had said in della pittura that mathematicians, not painters, deal with objects deprived of material he must already have had in mind the basic conception concerning the perfect forms of build- ings which he would spin into the architectural theory. But in della pit- tura he only once began to approach a discussion of the perfect forms, and that was in a passage in which he deprecated artists who ignore na- 42 De re acd., IX.Xi, 43 See my article 'Alberti's View of Painting and the Liberal Arts' to appear in the Jotlrnal of the History of Ideas.</page><page sequence="11">CARROLL W. WESTFALL 71 ture and therefore depart from and lose sight of the 'idea delle bellezze'.44 This term is usually translated 'idea of beauty' but it is certainly looser than that; it is 'idea of beauties', and is really of little substantial use to the painter. It only makes the istoria more effective but the istoria is based esselltially on poetic invention. For the architect, perspective is more important because it reveals the geometric shapes around which nature generates or makes natural objects; it allows the architect to co-ordinate the operations of mind, hand, and nature in construction because it al- lows the architcct to penetrate into the creative process of God's nature through direct, visual observation which can be applied to the process of design. A building made of design and material is a part of nature based on the theory of perspective, while an istoria is a part of poetry conveyed by a technique founded on perspective. In the theory of ar- chitecture perspective moves from the subordinate role it had had in the theory of painting to the central, superior one which allows the intellect to control Fortune and serve society.45 Alberti did for the architect what he could not do for the painter: he introduced him into the widest possible field of activity where he could participate in natural and social events. His effectiveness depends upon his understanding of nature's processes and society's requirements. The architect orders both material and events, and successful ordering pro- duces beauty, for beauty is not only a graceful design in itself but is also the control of material to make a durable building and the aptness of a building for its purpose. Through beauty the architect directly affects society because a beautiful design has an effect on citizens and on civic 44 Alberti, della pittura, ed. Luigi Malle (Raccolta di fonte per la storia dell'arte, vol. 7), Florence, I950, p. I07. (For an English translation see On Painting, tr.John Spencer, New Haven and London, revised edition, I966, p. 63.) 45 The interpretation proposed by G. C. Argan and others that perspective was de- veloped by Brunelleschi as a tool for architectural design and subsequently developed by Alberti in the theory of architecture has come under attack recently by Howard Saalman in his review of Eugenio Luporini, Bru1lelleschi,forma e ragione, Art Bulletin, XLVIII (I966), 442-445* Saalman bases his criticism on the interpretation on his reading of de re aed., II.i., esp. 99, but fails to recognize that, I) Alberti condemns the use of fancy renderings of projected buildings to give an inflated impression of the proposal, and 2) separates the product of the painter (a painting) from the product of the architect (a buildlng) when he points out the differences between painter and architect; in other words, Alberti does not do what Saalman says he does: issue an 'emphatic injunction against perspective as a tool for the architect', by which Saalman must mean during the process of design. I am sup- porting here the 'Italian thesis', as Saalman calls it, for which see in addition to those cited in his review, R.

Only by understanding the relationship between architecture and poetry will the social role of the architect and the didactic potential of architecture be made clear. In Renaissance poetic theory there were two levels of didacticism, one overt and the other subvert. Boccaccio had explained overt didacticism by noting that poetry arranges . . . meditations in a fixed order, adorns the wllole composition with unusual interreaving of words and thoughts; and thus it vWils trutll in a fair and fitting gar- ment of fiction.48 Allegorical frescoes painted according to the prescriptions of della pittura and decorating buildings as explained in de re aediJVcatoria would fully exploit this application of the liaison between poets, painters, and archi- tects.49 More to the point for architects, however, was the hidden and veiled truth beyond mere allegory which again Boccaccio discussed: 'What name,' he asks, should be applied to those parts of the Revelation of Jolm the Evangelist expressed with amazing mastery of inner sense, though often at first glance quite contrary to the trutll in wllich he llas veiled the great mysteries of God.50 Boccaccio was quoting St. Jerome, whose ideas Salutati developed in this way: These verses delight everyone with their graceful form, and while they catcll tlle ear with tlleir sweet and rhythmic flow they enter the soul and seize upon tlle innermost places of the heart.5l 46 Bialostocki, 'The Power of Beauty', op. cit., passim. 47 There is an important difference, however. The painter addresses each citizen indi- vidually; whereas the architect addresses citizens collectively, or at least emphasizes the collection of citizens rather than each citizen in turn. 48 Boccaccio, Genealogia deorumgentilium, trans. and discussed by C.

WESTFALL 73 Leonardo Bruni incorporated these ideas into a defillition in the Life of Dante of I436, which emphasized the verse making activity of the poet: The name of poet connotes an excellent and admirable style in verse, veiled and shad- owed with gracefulness and with high deceitfulness . . . only he who is supremely ex- cellent therein is called a poet.52 In each statement the theorist indicates that something moves the hearer directly; it is some harmony of sounds, some music which is in poetry itself. In architecture such a harmony would be provided by the second principle of design, finishing or proportions, which Alberti had based on philosophy and for which he had cited musical proportions as analo- gous to architectural proportions. It has long been kllown that here A1- berti is emphasizing a relationship between a microcosm such as the central temple of a city and the cosmos, that is, God's universe of har- mony, order, and proportion.53 It has even been suggested that in using this concept Alberti allied himself with the newly revived interest in Neoplatonism.54 But call what he says here be connected with the llew Renaissance Neoplatollism? There is no published work preceding de re aediJVcatoria's writing which adumbrates a new, Renaissance concept of Neoplatonic artistic 52 L. Bruni, Vita di Dante, ed.

Alberti is loosely taken to be a Renaissance Neoplatonist because his name is often juxtaposed with discussions of au- thentic Neoplatonists. See for example, Bialostocki, 'The Power of Beauty', op. cit., p. I7: 'Andre Chastel stressed the interest of Alberti in neoplatollism [A. Chastel, Marsile Fici et l'art, Geneva and Lille, I954, I07 ff.], .... Wittkower also connects Alberti's "inborn sense" with the Neoplatonic tradition in Renaissance thought', at which point Bialostocki cites ArcXlitcstural Principles, p. 27. Chastel indicates clearly (pp. I08-I09) that Alberti's treatise contains Pythagorean elements exploited by the Careggi academy, but no more. Of della pittura Chastel states that it is 'inclinees vers les propositions du nouvel humanisme platonicien', (I08) and of the treatise on architecture: 'I1 n'en faut pas conclure qu'Alberti fut sur tous ces points debiteur des doctrines neoplatoniciennes: c'est imposee aux philosophes de l'Academie de leur "pythagorisme"'. (I09) Wittkower also stresses Pythagorean elements, and in a confusing passage which moves from Alberti through Cusa to Pacioli and includes a mis- leading note to Gombrich's study ('Icones Symbolicae, the Visual Image in Neo-Platonic Thought', Jorlrnal of tlle Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, XI [I948], I63-I92) on Neopla- tonic intuitions, he manages to suggest to Bialostocki the misleading impression quoted above. These three instances indicate that the idelltity of the Platonic tradition Alberti was following has not been sought and that Alberti call therefore easily be incorrectly linked by the unwary with Ficino. Similar examples abound in the literature; it would only be tiresome to cite them here.</page><page sequence="14">74 ALBERTI AND THE HUMANIST ARCHITECT production.55 The Platollic concept of thefuror poe;ticus appears in Italian art treatises first in Luca Pacioli's Divine proporzione of I509, but this is less an art treatise than a treatise on proportions which by that time painters under the aegis of Leonardo had incorporated into their theo- retical structure. (It should be recalled that proportions are not discussed ill della pittura except as simple measurements.) The writings of Agrippa of Nettesheim which also appeared in I509 apply the concept directly to artistic creations, but his sources seem to be Northern, not Italian.56 It was not until after I453 that Marsilio Ficino, perhaps with the assistance of Alberti, introduced a fully developed commentary on the furores with the related notion that forms in the mind are ideas which partici- pate directly in the idea of God without the intermediary of God's crea- tion, nature.57 Ficino had notoriously little to do with art. Alberti would have kncywn of the concept of Platollic ideas from Plato's Republic and other works available by then,58 as well as from Seneca's Letters, Cic- ero's Orator, and writings of Augustine which transmitted essential sec- tions of Cicero's and Plato's thought; but the development of this con- cept as it applied to sound, sight, and proportions by the time Alberti was writing de re aediJVcatoria was both distinctly different from Ficino's development of it, and quite traditional. The concept that the furores 55 There was Neoplatonism of a new stripe, at least new to Italy, however, in Pletho's lectures in Florence in I43 8.

WESTFALL 75 moved the artist was 'in the air', but prior to Ficino it had not been de- veloped systematically in a manner significantly diSerent from the tra- ditional interpretation, especially by Alberti in the architectural treatise. The traditional interpretation which Ficino could easily develop was well entrenched in the writings of Boccaccio, Salutati, and Bruni, who all touched on the co1lcept of divine inspiration in one way or another. There has existed, they said, a class of poets which enjoyed access to divine knowledge, or at least has been allowed to convey it. According to Bruni's Life of Dante, a person becomes a poet in olle of two ways: One of these is through his own p;enius, excited and aroused by some inward and hid- den force which is called frenzy and possession of the mind.... So in poetry some be- come poets through an inner excitement and through a certain application ofthe mind. This is the highest and most perfect liind of poetry; whence some say that poets are divine, others call them sacred, and others prophets.59 Bruni cited three examples of divinely frenzied poets: St. Francis, the Christian saint, 'who knew more of God than do the theologians through study and letters',60 and the pagans Hesiod and Orpheus. Bruni did not invent the notion. The middle ages had never lost it since its development in antiquity.61 Boccaccio had referred to the poet on several occasions as one possessed when he formulated his poetry. 'This poetry . * . is a sort of fervid and exquisite invention, in speech or writing, of that which the mind has invented.'62 Boccaccio did not cat- egorically separate poets as did Bruni, and he did not clearly identify the source of the frenzy. As late as the turn of the century humanists in Florence did not look among themselves for a frenzied poet; the poet was considered a disciplined grammarian who knew llis classical heri- tage. Salutati for example equalled and surpassed the ancients, according to Bruni, because of his 'almost divine intellect'.63 It was only later, in the Life of Dante, that the method this intellect used became the basis for a definitio1l of the other and certainly more common type of poet. Poets ofthis type 'create their poetry by means of knowledge and study, by discipline, art, and forethought'.64 Dante was in this second, lower 59 Bruni, op. cit., p . I07. 60 Ibid. 61 See E. R.

The emphasis of the definitions of both poet and architect is the same: Because he lacks direct frenzied in- spiration which would supply perfect forms from an idea immanent with the Godhead, the architect or the poet uses his innate virtu in fol- lowing a disciplined theory and method; the source for the poet is an- cient eloquence which tells of the acts of great men of the past (history is part of nature), and the source for the architect is nature. The parallel between the architect in Alberti's writings and tlle poet in Bruni's is quite striking, but only according to the definitions in the Life of Dante. This is clear from another condition of poetry which Bru1li inherited from his predecessors and transformed in that Life. Boccaccio had stressed the idea that even for the rare, inspired poet, poetic fervor is not enough. It only 'sharpens and illurnines the powers of the mind' and then this inspiration must be 'wrought out by art'.66 'Indeed, the word poetry,' Boccaccio continues, does not have 'the ori- gin that many carelessly suppose, namely, poio, pois, wllich is but Latin fingo, fingis; rather, it is derived from a very ancient Greek word poetis, which means in Latin exquisite discourse (exquisita locutio).'67 Here Boccaccio reversed the emphasis of the definition; he wished to stress the effect of the poetry, not the process used in writing it. Salutati and Bruni at the turn of the century did not revise this thesis, but in I436 Bruni returned to what Boccaccio had rejected: 'I say then, that this name poet is a Greek name, and as such means one who makes.'68 The verse he makes is still important; it results from 'excellence of style, that is, the syllables, measure, and sound pertain only to him who speaks in verse.'69 Because verse is used, poetry is placed in a separate class from other means of conveying virtuous, didactic messages; verse alone has the ability to convey those hidden meanings which will serve the didac- tic purposes of eloquence on the subvert level. Verse differs from other fortns of eloquence as architecture differs from painting. The proportions visible in buildings in the finishing al- 65 Sallust and Livy qualified as poets since they wrote history. Ibid., p.

WESTFALL 77 low a building to convey a didactic meaning which can move the viewer directly and soothe and stir the heart and soul, as we have seen. Furthermore, as Professor Wittkower has explained, the microcos- mic church (temple) in Alberti's theory is able to convey to men through proportions the mysterious harmonies of the universe.70 But how does the visitor receive these proportions and harmonies? Alberti had derived the proportions from God through music and philosophy and had superimposed them upon and woven them into the numbers and forms which he had derived from God through nature. Orpheus the musician/philosopher had illvented music;71 even for Bruni Orpheus was a poet who was given his poetry in an internal frenzy. Only at second hand, from the poets, philosophers, and musi- cians, did the architect receive frenzied ideas. Plato and other ancient philosophers were other sources for proportions and for some numbers which the architect investigates, but nature is the most importa1lt source xfor the most important element, the perfect forms; and in searching in nature the architect uses his eyes, Alberti's constant ally in the treatises on art. In della pittura the velo sottilissimo had taught the eye how to ob- serve nature. So too, the beholder of the painter's product must look. The ear is necessary to hear the sounds of the verse which conveys har- monies. It would seem that in architecture the eyes must perceive the 11armonies within the forms. Alberti may have had in mind a direct spiritual rapport between the proportions of the building and the mind, intellect, and soul of the observer, but he does not say so directly.72 Only later will the basis of design for artists and poets arise not from the dis- ciplined observation of nature but directly from the spiritual rapport between man and God. Proportions derive not so much from nature 70 Wittkower, ArcXlitectural Principles, I and IV. 71 D. P.

See also Wittkower, ArcZlitectural Principles, p. 27, n. 2; and Bialostocki, 'The Power of Beauty', passim. The nearest he does come to saying it con- tains an emphasis on the importance of vision as well as the ability to know quality in- stinctually. See de re aed., II.i.95 f. Giannozzo Manetti, in his description of the renovations of St. Peter's Basilica proposed by Nicholas V with Alberti's assistance, is perhaps the first person closely related to Alberti to draw attention to anthropomorphic or nzan-as- microcosm and to cosmic references in an architectural design. Manetti carefully stated that neither man nor the cosmos was a source Nicholas had in mind; indeed, Manetti states that he had discovered them himself through contemplation of the design. See the text of the relevant section from Manetti's life of Nicholas published by Torgil Magnu- son in Studies in RomanQuattrocentoArchitecture, Stockholm, I958, pp. 35I-362, 1l.

This hardly seems likely. For Alberti, the architect makes an ordered environmerlt in which men will be moved to desire virtue through the vision of beauty and orna1nent. He said this allegorically in Tranquillita dell'animo.74 The city he describes in de re acdificatorza is such a place of harmony and order. The city is beautiful when all the buildings irl it satisfy the social re- quirements he outlined in the secorld section of the treatise, wllen they are durable according to the requirements of the first section, and when their design is controlled and ordered according to the process of design irltroduced in the first section and explained in the third section. Throughout the treatise there is a liberal feeling of discovery and ex- ploration, of inventiveness and of rational thought which the architect himself, alone alld unassisted by traditional techniques and metllods, uses in his design process. The body of man, for example, is rejected as a microcosmic model and as a natural object with a special claim to au- thority.75 It is no more important as a source of perfect forms and num- 73 For this entire problem see Karl Giehlow, 'Die Hieroglyphenkunde des Humanis- mus in der Allegorie der Renaissance',Jahrbuch des kunsthistorischen Sammlungen des allerh.

Bonucci, Florence, I843, I, 7-I26; 77. 75 Cassirer has said ofthis concept that it is 'one ofthe basic motifs ofthe Renaissance', and he calls it microcosmic, but in the sense Pico had in mind, that man is a free-willed, intellectual creature independent of place or of predetermined value predicated upon out- side forces or definitions. This concept 'seemed to be the middle ground where the Ren- aissance concept of nature and its concept of humanitatis met and reciprocally determined each other. As a symbol, as an image of nature, man is as much related to nature as he is distinct from it'. (Original emphasis.) Individual an1d Cosmos, p. IO9. No later theorist would maintain so great a distinction between man and nature. Fila- rete is at times absurdly anthropomorphic in his theoretical foundations for design.

Alberti's thesis is completely removed 79 frozn what may be called a medieval position in which the artist is to uncover a pre-existent universal order and establish that order on its appropriate scale and in its appropriate position within its hierarchical context. Alberti invented a new method from ancient and traditional sources; as he uses that method to design buildings he discovers perfect forms and numbers for himself, that is, he discovers forms through his own observation of nature, and he discovers proportions in his own knowledge of philosophy. His source of beauty and of order is in the intellectual process which he as a liberal artist follows. Alberti does not consider himself a tool within history directed by providential inter- vention. Fortune will intervene in his works, but she will cause harm only when the architect chooses to play lightly with that fickle goddess. The intellect of Alberti's architect must be like God's, but with domin- ion over only the terrestrial matters that affect him; and the measure of his success is in how well he can promote an ordered environment for others like himself and in cooperation with a like-minded humanist pa- tron. Since his rewards for success in this effort are everlasting virtue and fame, Alberti's architectural treatise traces a program of civic activity clearly within the mainstream of early Renaissance humanist thought.

Lotz, 'Ein Dionakratesdarstellung des Francesco di Giorgio,' Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Instituts in Florenz, v (Ig37/42), 428-433; 428; states that Francesco di Giorgio raised the concept of anthropomorphic proportions for architecture to the status of a postulate.</page></plain_text>
