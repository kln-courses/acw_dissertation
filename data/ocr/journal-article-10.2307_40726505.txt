Ser. 35(1981-83) WOMEN AND POLITICAL POWER IN THE TRADITIONAL T'O-PA ELITE: A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF THE BIOGRAPHIES OF EMPRESSES IN THE WEISHU JENNIFER HOLMGREN Australian National University It is often suggested that under the influence of a freer nomadic life-style, the Chinese woman in the Northern Dynasties and subsequent T'ang period enjoyed a degree of freedom and independence unsur- passed in later centuries of Chinese history. Both written and archaeo- logical records have been used to demonstrate this view of medieval Chinese society. Archaeological relics show women of this time indulg- ing in pastimes and activities considered shocking by later generations of Chinese scholars, while written records reveal a relatively high in- cidence of female-initiated divorce and remarriage among the upper- classes. Then there are the records of such politically powerful women as the Empress-dowagers Wen-ming X^(d. 490 AD)1 and Ling S Abbreviations used: CS Chin-shu M. Peking, 1974.

However, within this theory of greater freedom for women in medieval Chinese society, very little thought has been put into delineat- ing the exact nature of the non-Chinese or nomadic contribution to this situation. Taking only one aspect of the hypothesis- the relatively high political status of women at this time- it is not difficult to see that the presence of two influential empress-dowagers at the Northern Wei court in the latter days of T'o-pa rule in north China tells us very little about traditional T'o-pa attitudes to female participation in political affairs. Neither does it tell us much about the unique qualities of Chinese society in the Northern Dynasties. Examples of politically influential consorts and empress-dowagers can be found throughout the gamut of Chinese history. Moreover, it still has to be demonstrated how a relatively mobile day-to-day life-style, as found among the northern pastoral peoples, leads to a relatively high political status for women in these and neighbouring societies. The first chapter in the dynastic history of the Northern Wei (WS 1) deals with the lives of T'o-pa leaders in the century before the foundation of the Northern Wei state, while the first nine biographies in the chapter on empresses in the Wei-shu (WS 13) deal with mothers and wives of those leaders. In this paper the material in these two chapters of the Wei-shu will be used to investigate the nature of the traditional T'o-pa leadership structure and the political role it assigned to women on the eve of the foundation of the Northern Wei state. It is hoped that such an investigation will provide a more solid founda- tion for comparing the status of women in upper-class Chinese and nomadic societies. ming and the Northern Wei Necropolis at Fang-shan.

It was put back into the Wei-shu by Sung historians in the tenth century who used the seventh century T'ang version of the chapter found in Pei-shih 13. The Sung historians also used material found in the Northern Ch'i encyclopaedia, Hsiu-wen tien yü-lan'&amp;%WM H , and a private history written in the ninth century by Kao Ch'ün Ü5^ and his son.6 Unfortunately, these latter two texts are no longer extant. The Pei-shih, however, has survived, and a comparison between the tenth century Sung version of the biographies in Wei-shu 13 and those found in Pei-shih 13 reveals no significant differences between the two texts. Thus, for all practical purposes, we can regard our present version of the biographies in Wei-shu 13 as a seventh century compilation by T'ang historians who had access to Wei Shou's original work. An annotated translation of each relevant biography in Wei-shu 13 can be found in the appendix (A) to the paper. For convenience, each biography has been numbered and then divided into numbered para- graphs (P). Thus, A 7, P 3 refers to the third paragraph in the seventh biography in the appendix to the paper. An important part of the annotations to the translations is the discussion on the ethnic and social background of each woman's family. Understanding the history of the woman's family both in her own time and during the period of compilation of the text proved to be an essential pre-requisite to per- ceiving the political status of women in traditional T'o-pa society through the various sino-centric biases and distortions in the text.

Lady Tou came from the same Hsien-pi background as the T'o-pa. First known to the Chinese as the Mo-lu-hui ¿&amp;|i[Bland then as the Ko-tou-ling Ifc S B? , her people later became an important distaff clan in the early T'ang period.8 However, Lady Tou herself seems to have made little personal impact on T'o-pa affairs during her lifetime. Moreover, it seems that she had no significance for the ancestry of the royal Northern Wei line. Her children, if she had any, are not known. Wei Shou may have included her biography in his text in default of knowledge about Li- wei's other wives and out of respect for Tou T'ai H . The latter was connected with the royal house of Northern Ch'i through his wife who was a sister of Kao Huan's M Sc wife née Lou II .9 For T'ang historians, Lady Tou's life raised questions about the maternal ancestry of the T'ang royal line since T'ang T'ai-tsung's mother had come from this clan.10 By the T'ang period, members of this family were claiming Chinese ancestry dating back to the Han era.11 While the retention of this biography in Pei-shih 13 may have been a tribute to the Tou family, it may also have been a subtle re- minder to T'ang readers about the true nature of T'ang T'ai-tsung's maternal ancestry. Lady Tou's biography attempts to present her father, Tou Pin R, as one of Li-wei's faithful supporters and we are left with the impres- sion that the rebellion by her brothers was an isolated affair in a steady alliance between the T'o-pa and the Mo-lu-hui peoples.12 However, Wei-shu 1 indicates that the alliance between the two groups actually rested on very uneasy ground.13 T'ang records of the Tou family go further than this and show that from the end of the third century, the 7) TCTC, pp. 2459-2460. 8) Al: n.3.

Sixteen years later, on the eve of Sha-mo-han's return, Li-wei was persuaded to get rid of him. This was done and the Tzu-chih t'ung-chien claims jealousy by Li-wei's other sons as the motive.15 However, Wei-shu 1 shows that the T'o-pa nobility at this time feared increasing Chinese interference- both political and cultural- in their affairs and saw Sha-mo-han as the vanguard of a new wave of Chinese activity in their ranks.16 Li-wei may well have shared these fears about a son he had not seen for so many years. We do not know who Sha-mo-han's mother had been. If it was Lady Tou, we could assume that Li-wei had also feared his son might try to avenge his mother's death. However, the sources give no hint of this. After Sha-mo-han's murder in 277, the Chinese, with the help of the Wu-huan prince, K'u Hsien^K , managed to sow discord among the T'o-pa by spreading the rumour that Li-wei, regretting his son's death, was about to take revenge on those responsible. Thus when Li- wei died in that same year, T'o-pa power in the north had been serious- ly weakened by internal dissension.17 Li-wei's place was taken by his fourth son, T'o-pa Hsi-luä&gt;§i (r. 277-286). Then came another of Li-wei's sons named Cho^ (r. 286- 293). After Cho's death, the leadership went to Sha-mo-han's youngest son, T'o-pa Fu jjjî (r. 293-294). 18 After Fu, the succession reverted to 14) Yao Wei-yüan, p. 176; A l:n. 3. 15) rcrc, pp. 2459, 2505,2541,2548. 16) WS 1, pp. 4-5. 17) The Chinese Machiavelli behind these events was Wei Huan^ïi. Huan was Inspector of Yü-chouÜW which lay to the east of li-wei's territory. In 275, Huan had asked the Chin emperor for ' permission to detain Sha-mo-han on his way home. By 277, when the latter was released, Li-wei had been persuaded to do away with him. Wei Huan then bribed the Wu-huan prince, K'u Hsien, to spread the rumour that li-wei wanted to avenge his son's death. See TCTC, pp. 2541-2548; WS 1, pp. 4-5. 18) TCTC, p. 2613 has Fu the son of T'o-pa Cho. WS 1, p. 5 has Fu the youn- gest son of Sha-mo-han.

Wei-shu 1 indicates that the selection of T'o-pa Fu as leader in 293 was made on the basis of his ability and popularity.20 His appoint- ment over and above both his uncle, Lu-kuan, and his two older brothers, Yi-yi and Yi-lu, illustrates the T'o-pa concern with capability in leadership. Age or strict adherence to laws of consanguinity took second place in the minds of the T'o-pa when selecting their leaders, for although they maintained a hereditary aristocracy, they nevertheless had to ensure that within that aristocracy supreme command always went to a capable adult well-versed in nomadic military strategy. The outcome of this concern was the system of fraternal succession where brother succeeded brother and nephew succeeded uncle. Such a system was not unique to the T'o-pa but shared by many nomadic societies on 19) TCTC, p. 2614; WS l,pp. 5-6. 20) WS l,p. 5.</page><page sequence="7">WOMEN AND POLITICAL POWER IN THE T' O-PA ELITE 39 the fringes of China at this time.21 It guaranteed continuity in com- petent leadership by ensuring the succession of the oldest, most capable male adult within a well-defined lineage. Thus, unlike the Chinese system of succession by primogeniture, the T'o-pa system had a high degree of flexibility in order to avoid the investiture of a minor or weakling.22 There may have been one other factor in the selection of T'o- pa Fu over his two older brothers in 293. If we trace the ethnic and cultural background of Sha-mo-han's three sons through the biographies of their mothers in Wei-shu 13, we find that Lady Lanffi, the mother of T'o-pa Fu, was of Hsien-pi origin.23 Lady Feng£J, the mother of T'o-pa Yi-yi and T'o-pa Yi-lu, seems to have been of Chinese origin.24 Thus, T'o-pa Fu may well have been chosen not only for his leadership qualities but also because the T'o-pa aristocracy preferred the "purity" of his ethnic and cultural heritage over the mixed heritage of his half- brothers, Yi-yi and Yi-lu. Although Lady Feng's (A 2) origins are by no means certain, a Chinese background for this woman does not conflict with what we know of Sha-mo-han's history of residence at the Chinese court. A Chinese origin for this woman not only explains the investiture of T'o-pa Fu over his older brothers, but also T'o-pa Yi-lu's partiality for Chinese advisers and his unwavering loyalty to them in the face of opposition from his own people. Lady Feng's reburial ceremony, carried out during her son's leadership, was attended by representatives of various Chin princes. It symbolized the new era of close Sino/T'o- pa contacts under Yi-lu's rule (295-316).25 21) K. A.

Internal</page><page sequence="8">40 JENNIFER HOLMGREN By 313, Yi-lu had shifted his people further south into the region of Ta-t'ung ^[h| in Shansi. There he set up a semi-permanent capital along Chinese lines.26 Under mounting criticism from a faction led by his deceased brother's wife, Lady Wei fi (A 4), and possibly his own son,27 Yi-lu maintained his outdated policy of alliance with the Chin court until his death in 316.28 Thus, Yi-lu's career became of some interest to later Chinese historians following the history of Sino/T'o-pa relations. In conformity with historical models acceptable to the Chinese mind, these historians gave Yi-lu's mother, Lady Feng (A 2), the rank of empress. Lady Lan (A 3), the Hsien-pi mother of T'o-pa Fu, was relegated to the position of concubine. Tftis is particularly interesting since it was Lady Lan who was the ancestress of the royal Northern Wei line. For later his- torians, the history of the Northern Wei dynastic line apparently took second place to interest in Sino/T'o-pa relations and Chinese influence in T'o-pa affairs. Fortunately, in dwelling on the biography of Lady Feng, the depiction of the Chinese ideal of succession by primogeniture in Wei- shu 13 goes somewhat astray and we are able to determine much more accurately than would otherwise have been the case some óf the biases of the T'ang historians who compiled the text. The selection and arrangement of the material in Wei-shu 1 3 is indicative of the seventh century concern to elevate the status of certain clans prominent in the early T'ang period. It also reflects the T'ang desire to extract from T'o-pa behaviour, patterns which conformed as much as possible to traditional Chinese historical models. Thus, without reference to anarchy and warfare between the Chin princes did not begin until the beginning of the fourth century. It was in that period, 301-305, that T'eng, as Inspector of Ping-chou #jW , and Yung, based in Yü-chou MJ&gt;H , desperately needed T'o-pa help against the Hsiung-nu. Thus it seems that the compilers of WS 1 placed the date of Lady Feng's reburial ceremony some 6-10 years too early. See CS 37, pp. 1096-1097 for the biography of Ssu-ma T'eng; CS 59, pp. 1615-1622 for the biographies of Ssu-ma Ying (d. 306) and Ssu-ma Yung (d. 307). 26) TCTC, pp. 2752-2753, 2806-2807; WS 1 , pp. 8-9. 27) TCTC, pp. 2814-2819; seen. 28 below. 28) He was murdered by his son, Liu-hsiu.

A diagram of succession in the early T'o-pa leadership as seen through the biographies of empresses in Wei-shu 13 shows a direct line of filial succession running from T'o-pa Li-wei in the third century to T'o-pa Kuei, the fourth century founder of the Northern Wei state. The most striking anomaly in this picture is the biography devoted to Lady Wei (A 4), the wife of T'o-pa Yi-yi.

Normally, this would have meant her exclusion from the text on empresses of the Northern Wei period. However, there were strong reasons why the Chinese historian felt compelled to devote some attention to this woman. As we have seen, Tang interest in early T'o-pa history lay primarily in depicting Sino/T'o-pa relations</page><page sequence="10">42 JENNIFER HOLMGREN and the growth of Chinese influence in T'o-pa affairs. Lady Wei was the only woman of Chinese origin29 who made an impact during her lifetime on the fortunes of Sino/T'o-pa relations. Moreover, her activities had a destabilizing effect on the political security of the line descending from T'o-pa Fu to the founder of the Northern Wei house. Her life-history thus gave the Chinese historian an opportunity to pro- pagandize about the evil consequences of allowing women control in government affairs (see below). A comparison of the material in Wei-shu 1, which is an original part of Wei Shou's sixth century text, and that in Wei-shu 13, basically a compilation of the T'ang period,30 indicates a difference in outlook between Chinese historians of the early sixth and seventh centuries. Wei-shu 1 makes little attempt to hide the peculiarities of the T'o-pa system of succession. Wei-shu 13, however, gives the reader the impres- sion of a reasonably smooth-functioning system of direct filial succes- sion. This suggests the possibility of considerable tampering by T'ang historians with at least the arrangement if not the content of the origi- nal material in Wei-shu 13. It also indicates the particular biases and interests of T'ang historians, the history of Sino/T'o-pa relations, the ancestry of various important seventh century clans, and confirmation of the validity of their own assumptions about various behavioural patterns. In the case of Lady Feng and Lady Lan, the rationale for Lady Feng's elevation to the rank of empress by the historians is obvious. Of Chinese origin, with a family name connecting her to an important Chinese clan of the Northern Wei and T'ang periods,31 married to a T'o-pa murdered for his supposed pro-Chinese attitudes, and mother of a T'o-pa ally against the Hsiung-nu, Lady Feng necessarily had to take precedence over the Hsien-pi mother of T'o-pa Fu. We can only speculate on the possibility that in the original sixth century text, Lady Lan had received more attention from Northern Ch'i historians than she did from those of the T'ang period. It is worth noting that although the Lan clan actually produced as many, if not more, prom- 29) A4: n. 2. 30) See n. 6 above. 31) Aim. 2.</page><page sequence="11">WOMEN AND POLITICAL POWER IN THE T'O-PA ELITE 43 inent officials in their day as did the Feng, such men rarely receive biographies of their own in the histories commissioned or edited in the T'ang period. The fact that Lady Lan was T'o-pa Kuei's great great grandmother may have saved her biography from complete deletion by the T'ang historians. Thus, as far as we can tell, neither Lady Tou, Lady Feng, nor Lady Lan (A 1-3) made any personal impact on T'o-pa affairs during their lifetimes. Lady Tou's murder in 247,32 Sha-mo-han's murder in 277, and the succession of Lady Lan's son in 293 all suggest that the early T'o-pa leadership was preoccupied with averting the danger to its independence inherent in the establishment of politico-marriage alliances with other powerful groups. One of the main guarantees against interference in the affairs of the leadership by women or distaff relatives associated with neighbouring peoples was the flexibility of the traditional system of fraternal succession. With such a system, physical or psychological domination of the elected leader was theoreti- cally impossible. It is significant that Lady Wei's (A 4) period of influence in T'o-pa affairs spanned the years when Chinese power in the north had collapsed completely and her sons were capable adults, able to govern in their own right. When Lady Wei's husband T'o-pa Yi-yi died in 305, her son P'u- ken iriB attempted to succeed to his father's portion of the realm. However, he was too young and lacked the necessary experience in military leadership. In 307, his uncle, Yi-lu, reunited the three territo- ries under his own command. P'u-ken did not, however, disappear from the T'o-pa scene. He remained in a prominent position serving under Yi-lu's leadership along with the latter's son, Liu-hsiu AftS .33 When Yi-lu died in 316, P'u-ken had gained the experience necessary to become undisputed leader of the T'o-pa peoples.34 His career empha- sizes the flexibility and importance of experience and capability in the T'o-pa system of succession. When P'u-ken died one month after his investiture as leader in 316, his mother, the Lady Wei (A 4), proclaimed her infant grandson 32) A 1,P l,n. 5. 33) WS l,p. 7; TCTC, pp. 2735,2784-2785,2800. 34) ^l,p. 9; TCTC, p. 2830.</page><page sequence="12">44 JENNIFER HOLMGREN (unnamed) as leader.

In attempting to secure the succession of a series of young or minor leaders, Lady Wei was inadvertently acting as an agent of siniciza- tion among the T'o-pa by promoting the concept of direct filial succes- sion. Her own role was to be that of empress-dowager, regent and de facto ruler for a minor chosen according to the Chinese law of primogeniture. However, her attempts to secure the succession of a minor were foiled firstly by her brother-in-law, Yi-lu in 307 and then by the premature deaths of both P'u-ken and his infant son in 316. Although Wei-shu 1 suggests that P'u-ken's son died a natural death, it is obvious that Lady Wei, at this time, would have had little chance of successfully promoting herself as regent for such a young ruler. This is not to say, however, that she had little support for her other policies. The tussle for power between her family and that of Yü-lü 35) rere, pp. 2831, 2840; WS l,p. 9.</page><page sequence="13">WOMEN AND POLITICAL POWER IN THE T'O-PA ELITE 45 (c. 316-321) involved issues of more immediate concern than a discus- sion of succession theory. At stake was the important question of political alliances. In 316, P'u-ken had dismissed Yi-lu's Chinese advisers and their supporters.36 Apparently, his plan was to placate the Liu Hsiung-nu. Yü-lü, however, refused to establish an alliance with these people.37 This may have been because of squabbles within the Hsiung-nu leader- ship and the impending split of Northern Han (308-319) into two factions. By 321, Lady Wei had enough backing among the T'o-pa for her pro-Chao (319-349) policy to have Yü-lü murdered and her second son T'o-pa Ho-ju Mill declared leader.38 Both Wei-shu 1 and the Tzu-chih t'ung-chien state that although Ho-ju succeeded Yü-lü in 321, he did not actually take control of government affairs until the end of 324. It seems that his mother, Lady Wei, governed the T'o-pa during those years.39 Whether this means that Ho-ju was a minor or that he simply agreed with his mother's ideas and cooperated with her is very difficult to determine. All sources state that Ho-ju was Yi-yi's son. Therefore, he must have been at least 16 when he came to power in 321. In the light of Lady Wei's extraordinary power between 321 and 324, and Ho-ju's sudden death not long after he began to rule in his own right, we could specu- late on the possibility of a power struggle between mother and son during those years and a not-so-accidental death for Ho-ju. However, such speculation leads straight into the trap set by the Cninese his- torians-interpreting these events through the mirror of Chinese histor- ical models and prejudices. A deliberately careful and subtle wording of the texts may have been meant to lead us, rightly or wrongly, to just such conclusions. If Ho-ju was considered by his contemporaries to be a minor in 321 , it would indicate that Lady Wei had been successful in persuading the T'o-pa to accept an immature ruler backed by a female regent. However, as we have seen, the degree of his immaturity is questionable. 36) TCTC, pp. 2830-2831 'WS l,p.9. 31) WS l,p.9. 38) TCTC, p. 2891. 39) A4,P 1; WS l,p. 10; TCTC, p. 2891.</page><page sequence="14">46 JENNIFER HOLMGREN As Yi-yi's son, he must have been on the verge of acceptability at the age of 16.

There is the possibility, however, that Ko-na was the son of Lady Wei by a second husband. The existence of the custom of levirate among the T'o-pa peoples, and the consistent refusal of Chinese his- torians-in particular T'ang historian- to acknowledge this fact41 gives rise to speculation that after Yi-yi's death in 305, Lady Wei might have married her brother-in-law, T'o-pa Yi-lu. A second marriage to T'o-pa Yi-lu c. 307 would explain the ease with which Yi-lu had amalgamated his brother's territory into his own in 307, and explain the protection given to P'u-ken after that date. Lady Wei's biography (A 4) is short but the disapprobation of the Chinese historian is well evident. Her crimes are listed as the murder of Yü-lü, the seizure of power, sending envoys to the state of Former Chao, and finally, domination of the government to the extent that Tai ft, the T'o-pa state, earned the nickname "The Woman's Realm." The only charge not levelled against her is that of marrying her deceased husband's brother. This may have been out of deference to the reputation of T'o-pa Yi-lu, son of Lady Feng and ally of the Chin court. The hackneyed phrase "fierce and jealous," used to de- scribe Lady Wei's character, reveals the bias of the historians towards this woman. It is unfortunate, but nevertheless typical of Chinese dynastic history writing, that the lives of many such women were dismissed with such meaningless clichés as this. The black portrait given Lady Wei is further highlighted by the biography given Lady Wang 3£ (A 5), a paragon of wisdom and resource- fulness. Lady Wang's biography gives us the impression that it was 40) TCTCy p. 2939; WS l,p. 10. 41) Apart from the case of Lady Ho-lan (A 7) discussed below, other records of levirate practices in T'o-pa society survive from the sixth century. One such case involved the sister of Empress-dowager Ling (n.2 above) who married her deceased husband's brother (a member of the royal T'o-pa household) c. 525-528.

In fact, at least four of Yü-lü's sons survived this event to become contestants for the T'o-pa leadership at various stages. One of these sons was T'o-pa Yi-huai!^(r. 329-335/337-338). In conformity with the presentation of a smoothly functioning system of primogeniture within the T'o-pa leadership, the Chinese historian in Wei-shu 13 neglected to mention Yi-huai's mother, the Lady Ho-lan USI .42 Lady Ho-lan is not even given a biography as Yü-lü's con- cubine as was Sha-mo-han's wife née Lan (A 3). Doubtless this was because the founder of the Northern Wei state, T'o-pa Kuei, was not one of her blood descendants. Moreover, the Ho-lan, like the Lan of A 3, were of Hsien-pi origin and generally received scant attention from Cninese historians in the seventh century.43 Unlike the Tou clan of A 1, the Lan and Ho-lan never adopted a false genealogy claiming Chinese origin. However, the Ho-lan did play an important role in the establishment of the Northern Wei state at the end of the fourth century (see the discussion on A 7 below). Again, we can speculate on the probability that the original sixth century chapter on empresses in Wei-shu 13 had contained a biography of Yi-huai's mother. However, we should also keep in mind that as some of the Ho-lan families were instrumental in the founding of Northern Chou c. 550, they may have been viewed rather unfavorably by Northern Ch'i historians in the sixth century.44 In 329, the Ho-lan managed to unseat Ko-na from the T'o-pa leadership. Yi-huai assumed the leadership and promptly sent his half-brother, Shih-yi-chien, to Later Chao as a hostage in order to forestall any threat from them to back Ko-na's claim to the leader- ship.45 Ko-na then fled to the Yü-wen, relatives by marriage through 42) Yü-lü had taken Ho-lan Ai-t'ou's daughter in marriage and given one of his own daughters to Ho-lan Kofël .

Lady Wang is represented as the model of virtuous motherhood- protective, wise and retiring. The fictitious story of her protection of the young Shih-yi-chien, taken directly from Ssu-ma Ch'ien's WIJIJS Shih-chi, helps to maintain this image of the triumph of good over evil.51 In this respect, the statement that Lady Wang was entirely responsible for the revival of T'o-pa fortunes in 338 is somewhat suspect. The story in Lady Wang's biography about Shih-yi-chien 's plan to build a new capital to the south of P'ing-ch'eng ¿pM in 33952 seems to point to a certain degree of influence by Lady Wang after Shih-yi- chien's succession to the leadership. The biography of Wang Chien £g , Lady Wang's brother's grandson, also indicates that Shih-yi-chien's maternal relatives enjoyed some favour under his rule (338- 376). 53 However, it is extremely difficult to determine how much influence Lady Wang's family had had in T'o-pa affairs before Shih-yi-chien came to power. The Wang may have been instrumental in persuading T'o-pa Kua, who was an extremely popular candidate for the leadership himself,54 to bring Snih-yi-chien back from Later Chao in 338. How- ever, one must suspect that this move was made primarily to placate Later Chao and thwart any attempt by them to forcibly place Snih- yi-chien in the leadership. The fact that Lady Wang's clan later pro- duced some prominent officials for the Northern Ch'i, Northern Chou, Liang and T'ang rulers55 and the fact that they were later regarded as a Chinese clan, makes one suspect that her importance has been exaggerated in Wei-shu 13; her biography having been developed primarily as a foil to that of Lady Wei. The latter seems to have been of much more importance during her lifetime than Lady Wang whose only real claim to fame was her blood relationship with the founder of the Northern Wei state, T'o-pa Kuei. 50) A5,P3. 51) A5,P l,n.6;5C43,p. 1738. 52) A 5,P 2; TCTC, p. 3030. 53) WS 30, pp. 709-711. 54) WS 14, p. 349. 55) A5: n. 2.</page><page sequence="18">50 JENNIFER HOLMGREN T'o-pa marriage alliances with the Liu Hsiung-nu to the south- east and the Ho-lan Hsien-pi to the north-east began during the leader- ship of Yü-lü (r. 3 16-32 1).56 Under his son, Shih-yi-chien, ties with these peoples were further strengthened.

By 344, when it seemed that the Mu-jung had successfully survived an attack by Later Chao, T'o-pa/Mu-jung differences were patched up and Shih-yi-chien took one of Mu-jung Huang's daughters.60 This woman (A 6) became the mother of T'o- pa Shih5l(d. 371) and was thus grandmother of the founder of the Northern Wei state, T'o-pa Kuei.

Later that year, she gave birth to T'o-pa Kuei.64 According to her biography, she later had another son, T'o-pa KubÄH ,65 Elsewhere we learn that by 376 she had had two sons; Kub and the Prince of Wei.66 Kub's own biography states that he was the son of T'o-pa Han. One of Han's other sons was T'o-pa Yi#, the Prince of Wei.67 Since Han was Shih's brother, it seems that the T'o-pa, like other nomadic peoples on China's northern borders,68 practised levirate where a wife, upon the death of her husband, remarried one of his surviving brothers.69 The work involved in the reconstruction of Lady Ho-lan's second marriage to her brother-in-law indicates the unwillingness of Chinese historians to record such customs. Chinese culture had a strict social taboo against such marriages, and in cases where the woman was to be represented as a model of virtuous conduct, reluctance to record such customs was particularly strong. In 376, Fu Chien's 7?g general, Fu Lofë, attacked the T'o-pa. Shih-yi-chien was sick and his forces were unable to withstand the Ch'in armies. The T'o-pa thus withdrew to the north of the Yin ranges until attacked from the north by the Kao-ch'e MM people.70 This pe- riod of T'o-pa history shows that the T'o-pa were by no means yet settled into a pattern of sedentary living. When the threat of attack became too great, they were still able to pack up and move their people and possessions- cattle and horses- over long distances.

The flight across the Yin ranges in 376 is referred to in Lady Ho- lan's biography.71 The story about the carriage wheel and Lady Ho- lan's supplication to the supernatural, like the story of Lady Wang's (A 5) protection of the infant Shih-yi-chien, is almost certainly ficti- tious. It is also misleading since at that time both Shih-yi-chien and six of his adult sons by the Lady Mu-jung (A 6) were still alive. T'o-pa Kuei was only four years old. Nowhere but in the Chinese mind would he have been considered near the succession. The conquest of Tai was made easy for Fu Lo by the murder of Shih-yi-chien and most of his sons after the return south in 376. Tai was divided into two; the administration of one area going to the Hsiung-nu, Liu K'u-jen gPJJ$:t, a T'o-pa ally, and the other going to his relative and enemy, Liu Wei-ch'en j$Jg .72 Both men had previ- ously taken T'o-pa wives and Liu K'u-jen himself was the son of Shih- yi-chien's sister. Kuei and his mother went to live with Liu K'u-jen's family.73 In 384, Liu K'u-jen was murdered and his younger brother, Liu (T'ou) Chüan (gg)#, came to power. A year later, he was murdered by K'u- jen's son, Liu Hsienlg. By that time, T'o-pa Kuei was fourteen years old and Liu Hsien decided to get rid of him too.74 Lady Ho-lan's biography (A 7) relates her part in Kuei's escape from the Liu clan and his return to her relatives, the Ho-lan.75 In the events of this time, we can see again the interlocking relationship between the leaders of these three groups: Liu Hsien's brother was married to T'o-pa Kuei's 71) A7,P2. 72) Shih-yi-chien was murdered by his eldest son, Shih-chiin.

Obviously, traditional T'o-pa</page><page sequence="23">WOMEN AND POLITICAL POWER IN THE T'O-PA ELITE 55 society, like that of the Ch'i-tan,76 did not observe the Chinese pro- hibition on cross-generation marriages. Kuei's marriage to Liu Chüan's daughter (A 9) produced the second Northern Wei emperor, T'o-pa Ssu (p|, while his marriage to his mother's sister produced T'o-pa ShaolS (see below). The Tzu-chih t'ung-chien account of Kuei's flight to the Ho-lan in 385 states that many of Shih-yi-chien's former advisers also fled to the Ho-lan at that time.77 In Lady Ho-lan's biography, we are told that the Ho-lan were not willing to give their support to Kuei's claim to the T'o-pa leadership, and that Kuei's relative, Liang-kan gH1 , forcibly opposed him.78 However, the fact that Kuei was made T'o-pa leader in that same year,79 and the fact that Liang-kan knew that Kuei had long been aware of his opposition to him,80 suggests that the opposi- tion to electing Kuei leader of the T'o-pa peoples was fairly minimal. Kuei obviously had the backing of most of Shih-yi-chien's former advisers and most of his mother's Ho-lan relatives. Lady Ho-lan's biography seems to be a reconstruction by later historians of the hazy events of 385-6 with the aim of providing more graphic detail for the history and more credit for Lady Ho-lan as mother-protector of the young founder of the Northern Wei state. Once in power, Kuei did not make the same mistake as his pre- decessor, Yi-huai, in hastily dispatching his Ho-lan allies. However, he did ensure that their powers were severely curtailed. He gave his uncle, Ho-lan Nalft , largely ceremonial and non-functional positions in the new administration and gradually broke up the Ho-lan confederacy by scattering its peoples. Once T'o-pa power in the north became firmly established, Ho-lan influence on the leadership gradually waned.81 76) Wittfogel and Feng, History of Chinese Society: Liao, pp. 211-212. 77) TCTC, pp. 3349-3351. 78) A7,P5. 79) TCTC, p. 3357. 80) TCTC, p. 3351. 81) The line through Ho Yüehfö , a brother of Kuei's maternal grandfather, held some important posts under T'ai-tsung (r. 409-423).

The following year saw the formal declaration of the Northern Wei state with T'o-pa Kuei as its first emperor.85 Two years later, in 400, Mu-jung Pao's daughter be- came the first real empress of the T'o-pa peoples; her predecessors were only granted that title posthumously.86 Lady Mu-jung's suitability for the position of empress was deter- mined by a peculiarly non-Chinese and (as far as we can tell) non-T'o-pa custom.87 An image of each candidate was cast in molten metal and the success of Lady Mu-jung's cast indicated her suitability for the role of empress.88 Thus, while the establishment in 398 of a Chinese style state with its emperor and imperial dynastic shrine indicates a degree of familiarity among the T'o-pa with Chinese procedure, the use of this custom to formalize the appointment of the empress suggests that the degree of sinicization at this stage was very superficial. More- over, the continued use of this custom in the selection of empresses in the early part of the fifth century89 suggests that the concept of a 82) T'o-pa Ku had been sent as an envoy to Mu-jung Ch'uiÜ in 390.

Ware, "An ordeal among the T'o-pa Wei," Toung-pao 32 (1936): 206-207 has been misled on this matter by assuming Erh-chu Jung^^^to have been a Hsien-pi or T'o-pa leader. For the T'o-pa, the use of metal divination seems to have been restricted to the selection of empresses after the establishment of the Northern Wei state. It is therefore probable that they borrowed the custom from the Hsiung-nu . 88) A8,P2;A9,P2. 89)A8;A9;H^5'13,p.315, biography of Empress Chao-ainée Yao$fc.</page><page sequence="25">WOMEN AND POLITICAL POWER IN THE T'O-PA ELITE 57 legal and formally appointed empress, or the idea of having a main or principal wife, was something alien to the traditional T'o-pa mind. Prior to Lady Mu-jung's entry into the harem in 397, Kuei had married the Hsiung-nu daughter of Liu Chiian (A 9). By 400, this woman must have been at least 30 years old.90 Her only champion at court, her brother, Liu Lo-ch'enUM , was either dead or had lost his usefulness to the T'o-pa cause.91 Lady Liu's other relatives, like her cousin, Liu Hsien, were actively working against the expansion of T'o- pa power in the north.92 Thus, as A 8, P 1-2 suggests, it was not difficult for Mu-jung Pao's daughter to obtain a monopoly on Kuei's affections. When T'o-pa Yi suggested that she be set up as empress, Kuei was only too happy to oblige. In this case, the metal-casting of images was used to formalize the emperor's and the court's wish. With Later Yen completely decimated, neither Lady Mu-jung nor her rela- tives had any chance to interfere in the internal affairs of the T'o-pa leadership. Her elevation to the rank of empress would, however, serve to placate the many officials and commoners forcibly transported to P'ing-ch'eng from the Mu-jung homelands. Our sources make no mention of Lady Mu-jung after 400. She apparently had no male children by Kuei93 and even her date of death went unrecorded. It seems she played no role at all in the T'o-pa government of her day. However, as Kuei's legal consort, she became of some consequence to later Chinese historians. For them, the posi- tion of first empress was one which demanded a degree of interest and respect. Thus we can assume that the Chinese historians are not mis- leading us when they suggest that Lady Mu-jung played no active part in T'o-pa political affairs. Lady Liu's biography states that in 409 she was forced to commit suicide because an ancient Wei law demanded the death of a woman 90) Presumably she was somewhere between 15 and 20 when first married to T'o-pa Kuei. 91) liu Lo-ch'en's dates are unknown.

Moreover, our records suggest that Lady Liu's son was never formally declared heir-apparent.95 As we have seen, T'o-pa survival depended largely upon capable leadership well-versed in military strategy. This resulted in a relatively flexible system of succession which precluded the idea of fixed filial succession and a pre-determined heir-apparent. The concept of having a fixed system of succession by primogeniture was thus Chinese.96 Traditional T'o-pa society had no need for a law demanding the suicide of the mother of the heir-apparent. It was the adoption of the Chinese dynastic system in 398 which produced this law in T'o-pa society.97 However the compilers of Wei-shu 13 failed to see the connection between the traditional T'o-pa system of succession and the appearance of the law on compulsory suicide for the mother of the heir-apparent in 409. They attributed the law to traditional T'o-pa culture rather than to the process of adjustment to the new system of dynastic succes- sion at the beginning of the fifth century. Since Wei-shu 13 is basically a T'ang compilation, we can assume that the opinion about the origin of the 409 law, expressed in A 9, P 3, is that of a T'ang historian.98 Wei-shu 3, taken from Wei T'an'sgTÄ Hou Wei-shu compiled in the Sui period,99 comes much closer to the 94) A 9, P3. 95) WS 2, p. 41; WS 3, p. 49; TCTC, p. 3554 only say that he was appointed Prince of Ch'i in 403. 96) See Tao Tien-yi, "The System of Imperial Succession during China's Former Han Dynasty ," PFEH 18 (1978): 171-191. 97) In his discussion of T'o-pa sinicization (dealing mainly with institutional history) Wang Tseng-ts'aii#^, "Pei Wei shih-ch'i te Hu-Han wen-t'i" dbi£B$fflföÄJ3 WSMyYu'Shih hsüeh-pao #Ä Wß 3 , no. 2 (1961): 2 also comes to the conclusion that the law on compulsory suicide derived from T'o-pa contact with Chinese culture. However, he concludes from this that by the early fifth century, the T'o-pa were completely at home with Chinese culture. He also makes the mistake of referring to Lady Liu (A 9) as Chinese. 98) See n.6 above. 99) Li Cheng-fen, "Wei-shu yüan-liu k'ao," pp. 336-370.</page><page sequence="27">WOMEN AND POLITICAL POWER IN THE T'O-PA ELITE 59 truth of the matter. There, the historian has T'o-pa Kuei explaining to his son about the precedent set by Han Wu-ti in 88 BC.100 Han Wu- ti had forced the mother of his young (and second) heir-apparent to commit suicide in order to prevent her taking power after his death.101 This rather extreme and unique solution to Han problems102 -perhaps inadvertently referred to on some occasion by one of Kuei's Chinese advisers- may have impressed the T'o-pa emperor as a solution to his own worries about female and distaff interference in the leadership after his death. It is also possible that the words quoted in Wei-shu 3 are those of a Chinese historian attempting to translate into Chinese idiom what was a peculiarly T'o-pa problem, continuation of the traditional male-orientated military dictatorship within the Chinese dynastic and bureaucratic organization. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Sui historian was probably better attuned to the T'o-pa mind than his T'ang counterpart. Reference to Lady Liu's suicide also occurs in the Wei-shu chap- ters on astronomy. In 406 and 407, court astronomers predicted the poisoning of the emperor, internal strife involving palace women, and the dismissal of the heir-apparent.103 If these predictions were not made with hindsight, but are genuine predictions from those years, it is likely that they prompted Kuei on the disastrous course of action which ended in his own murder and the execution of his son, Shao, in 409 (see below). The action taken by Han Wu-ti in 88 BC may have seemed the perfect answer to prophecies of internal strife involving women of the harem. The 409 law was thus a result of Sino/T'o-pa cultural contact dur- ing the late fourth and early fifth centuries.

As we have seen, the succession of a young or incompetent prince, dominated by a female regent, had no place in the traditional T'o-pa leadership system. Even with the succession of an adult prince, the leadership could not be sure of eliminating distaff interference in the administration. Chinese history abounded with stories of the di- sastrous results of allowing empresses, concubines or distaff relatives some measure of power.104 These fears were most prevalent among Chinese Confucian officials with whom the T'o-pa leadership had some contact after the conquest of Later Yen in 397. We can assume that Chinese fears about female and distaff interference in government affairs played an increasing role in T'o-pa misgivings about the role of the empress and empress-dowager in the Chinese system of dynastic succession during the fifth century.105 As mentioned above, in his early days, T'o-pa Kuei had strength- ened the T'o-pa/Ho-lan alliance by taking to wife his maternal aunt who bore him T'o-pa Shao. According to Shao's biography in the Wei-shu, Kuei's mother opposed the match because her sister was already married, and being of some beauty, was bound to have a deleterious effect on the stability of the state.106 This mode of expression is peculiarly Chinese and not that expected of a non-sinicized Hsien-pi woman of the fourth century. Since it illustrates a very common Chinese historiographical lesson on the destructive consequences of obsession with feminine beauty, it is likely that these objections were 104) See A. R.

The fact that they are placed right at the end of Shao's biography makes them analogous to the "historian's comments" at the end of each chapter in the dynastic history . Just as Lady Ho-lan's objections to the marriage between her son and her sister illustrate the truth of certain Chinese values and historical models, so the depiction of T'o-pa Shao, the offspring of that marriage, as wild and unruly serves to whitewash the last years of Kuei's rule and to illustrate the veracity of cause and effect cycles in these his- toriographical models. Shao's biographers state that because he was wild and uncontrollable, Kuei, blaming the prince's mother, had her locked up and planned to murder her.107 However, Shao's biography also shows that his patricidal action to save his mother had considerable support both within the palace and in the bureaucracy. When Kuei was aroused at night by Shao's intrusion into the palace, his bow and knife were not to be found, and when Shao's brother, Ssu, came to power, he had soldiers, eunuchs, and several tens of palace officials condemned to death for complicity in Kuei's murder.108 Thus the internal evidence in Shao's biography about his part in Kuei's death is somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, the histo- rians describe him as a wild parricide, and on the other, as having con- siderable support within the palace and bureaucracy to save his mother and get rid of the reigning emperor. Presentation of Lady Ho-lan's son as wild and unruly surely stems from the Chinese concern to illustrate the veracity of traditional Chinese historiographical models. In this particular motif, unfilial conduct and patricide were the results of Kuei's previous lust for his mother's sister and the murder of her first husband.109 The incarceration of Lady Ho-lan in 409 came directly after the murder of several competent officials, the execution of T'o-pa Yi Kuei's half-brother, the forced suicide of Lady Liu (A 9) the mother of Kuei's eldest son, and the extermination of over hundred Mu-jung 107) WS 16, pp. 389-390. 108) WS 16, p. 390. 109) WS 16, p. 390.</page><page sequence="30">62 JENNIFER HOLMGREN families who had tried to return tö their homeland in the east. Ssu-ma Kuang 1r|JSÌ5fc concluded that T'o-pa Kuei was violently insane,110 and one may suppose that T'o-pa Shao received the support he did because of his father's instability of mind. However, although Kuei was undoubtedly ill at this time,111 there was some method in his mad- ness. His brother, Yi, was a competent and experienced military leader. In the traditional system of T'o-pa succession he would certainly have had precedence over Kuei's sons in a contest for the leadership. It is possible that Yi's so-called rebellion in 409 was a premature attempt by some members of the leadership to oust the ailing emperor from power and replace him with his more competent brother. Conclusion T'o-pa independence in north China during the third and fourth centuries depended very much on the ability of its leaders to contain the expansion of other nomadic groups in the region. Until the latter part of the fourth century this was achieved mainly through a series of transient military alliances with the Chinese (A 2, A4), the Tou (A 1), the Wang (A 5), the Ho-lan (A 7), the Mu-jung (A 6, A 8), the Yü-wen, the Lan (A3) and the Liu Hsiung-nu (A 9) leaders. As we have seen, these alliances were usually cemented by marriage contracts. In a system of fixed filial succession, such marriages would have left the T'o-pa extremely vulnerable to distaff interference and internal subver- sion of the leadership. The traditional system of fraternal succession minimized this danger for it secured the election of the most capable male in the same generation as, or older than, the outgoing leader. Adoption of the Chinese system of filial succession at the end of the fourth century left the leadership exposed to the political machina- tions of distaff groups operating through the position of empress or empress-dowager. T'o-pa Kuei's murder of his brother, the forced suicide of his eldest son's mother and the planned murder of his second son's mother in 409 were aimed at eliminating the possibility of distaff power and internecine disputes in the leadership after his death. 110) TCTC, pp. 3614, 3619.

Traditional T'o-pa society lacked any equivalent of the Chinese empress, empress-dowager or regency governments. Neither T'o-pa women, nor those married into the T'o-pa elite, had any legitimate opportunity to exercise political power. Neither had they any indirect means of influencing the leadership. Women in T'o-pa society were merely passive instruments in cementing temporary politico-military alliances with outside groups. While we cannot generalize from this about conditions in other nomadic societies of the time, the T'o-pa example does illustrate the naivety in assuming a direct and simple relationship between independence and mobility in daily life-style and the political role of women in these societies. It also cautions against hasty conclusions about nomadic influence on the political status of women in medieval Chinese society.</page><page sequence="32">64 JENNIFER HOLMGREN APPENDIX A 1 The Empress of Shen Yuan née Tou P 1 Shen Yüan's1 empress came from the Tou clan. She was the daughter of Pin,2 the elder of the Mo-lu-hui people.3 When Pin was on his death-bed, he warned his two sons, Su-hou äüß4 and Hui-t'iíãIS, to serve the emperor faithfully. Then he passed away. As the emperor was to attend the funeral rites, Su-hou and some others planned a rebellion. Word of this leaked out and came to the emperor's notice. Aware of their unfaithfulness, he made plans in preparation. A man was secreted in the palace and early in the morning he took a dagger and killed the empress.5 Word was hastily sent to Su-hou and the others that the empress had died a violent death. Taking alarm, they fled. When they returned, they were seized and killed. Notes to A 1 : 1) Shen Yiian-ti was T'o-pa Ii-wei. 2) Tou Pin has no biography in the WS.

They then became known as the Ko-tou-ling or Ko-t'u-lin$z¿$E2$. See Boodberg, "Language," p. 177 on the Hsien-pi meaning of Ko-t'u-lin. They retained that name until the time of YenjR , who shifted south to Loyang with the T'o-pa court at the end of the fifth century.

Feng TouJäis the earliest known member of the Hsien-pi group. He flourished in the late fourth century about a hundred years after the Lady Feng of A 2. Since the historians make no connection between him and the Lady Feng (WS 51 , p. 1 134) we can assume that they did not regard Lady Feng as belonging to this clan but to the Chinese clan of Po-hai. The Chinese Feng clan reached their apogee of power under the Mu-jung rulers of Later Yen and the early rulers of Northern Wei.

It produced at least seventeen officials of rank five and above for the Northern Wei rulers and another eight high ranking officials for the Northern Ch'i. Although the Feng continued to produce high ranking officials during the early T'ang period, they do not seem to have been considered one of the great northeastern clans of the T'ang. See D. Johnson, "The Medieval Chinese Oligarchy" (Ph.D. Thesis, Univ. California, Berkeley, 1970), pp. 311-340. It is possible that some of the high status individuals of the T'ang period who claimed descent from the Feng of Po-hai were in fact descendants of the Shih-fen Hsien-pi peoples. 3) Emperor Huan was T'o-pa Yi-yi.

When young, the empress had been chosen to enter the eastern palace because of her beauty and disposition. She gave birth to T'ai-tsu.3 P 2 When Fu Lo attacked the state, the empress took T'ai-tsu and fled from the troubles to the northern regions with some of the advisers of the former ruler. After a time, the Kao-ch'e made a surprise attack and the empress got into a carriage to take them south. On the way, they had trouble with one of the linch pins of the carriage. The em- press was afraid. Raising her face towards the heavens, she said: "Is it meant that the heir to the state is to be exterminated? Only the supernatural can help us now." Suddenly, the fault in the wheel cor- rected itself and they were not overturned. They travelled over a hundred // coming to safety in the southern regions of the Ch'i-chien Mountains -fc^ili.4 P 3 Later, liu Hsien sent someone to kill T'ai-tsu. The emperor's paternal aunt was the wife of K'ang-ni /CH, Hsien 's younger brother. She knew about the plot and secretly informed the empress. Liang Chüan ü# also came to warn of the trouble and the empress ordered T'ai-tsu to flee. That night, Hsien was made drunk by the empress. Towards daybreak, there was a disturbance among the horses in the stable and Hsien sent someone to investigate. The empress then wept and said: "At first all my sons were here. Now all have perished. Who has done this deed?" Thus Hsien did not send someone in pursuit 2) The Ho were Hsien-pi originally known as the Ho-lan. See L. Bazin, "Re- cherches sur les parlers T'o-pa," Toung-pao 39(1949-50): 290-291 for the Hsien-pi meaning of the word "Ho-lan." Like the Tou (A 1) and the T'o-pa them- selves, the Ho-lan do not seem to have had much contact with the Chinese before the end of the third century. The earliest known member of the group is Ho Ko, Lady Ho-lan 's grandfather. Like the Lan and the Mu-jung clans of A 3, A 6 and A 8, the Ho-lan reached the apogee of their power in the fourth and early fifth centuries. Although they continued to hold important official posts right up to the T'ang dynasty, they were not given very sympathetic treatment by T'ang historians. Few were considered deserving of their own biographies in works edited under the T'ang rulers. See Yao Wei-yüan, Pei-ch'ao hu-hsing-k'ao, pp. 32-38; WS 83 A, pp. 1812-1813 for the biography of Ho Na, brother of Lady Ho-lan; Chou-shu 20 , pp. 33 5 -339 ;LHWT, pp. 538-539. 3) T'ai-tsu was T'o-pa Kuei (r. 398-409). 4) For a discussion on this event see p. 53 above.</page><page sequence="39">WOMEN AND POLITICAL POWER IN THE T'O-PA ELITE 7 1 of T'ai-tsu who was able to get away to the Ho-lan. The Ho-lan were not yet ready to accept him as leader, but the empress' cousin, Yüeh f£ , gathered a crowd of followers and served him with full ceremonial.5 P 4 Hsien was angry and was going to kill the empress. She fled during the night to K'ang-ni's family where she was hidden for three days in a spirit cart.6 K'ang-ni gathered his family together and went to his brother to beg on her behalf. And so she escaped death. When troubles arose among Liu Hsien 's supporters, she fled back to her own clan. P 5 Later, the empress' brother, Liang-kan, jealous of T'ai-tsu 's ability to capture men's loyalty, raised an army and surrounded the travelling palace.7 The empress came out and said to Liang-kan: "What will you and the others do with me when you have killed my son?" Liang-kan was ashamed and withdrew.8 P 6 Later, Kub, the Prince of Ch'in, the youngest of the empress' sons, was sent as an envoy to Mu-jung Ch'ui of Yen who detained him.9 When Kub did not return, the empress became sick with anger and kept to her bed. In the first year of the Huang-shih era, she passed away at the age of 46 sui.10 She was buried with the ancestors in the 5) See WS 83 A, p. 1813 for Yuen's biography. 6) According to the commentary in TCTC, p. 335 1 , the 1 'o-pa Kept tne images of their deities in a movable cart.

After the wording in TCTC, p. 31 13, I have assumed that the statue was of the lady herself.

In T'ai-tsu's last year6 the empress died according to this old law. When T'ai-tsung came to the throne, he honoured her posthumously and offered sacrifices for her in the ancestral temple.
