<plain_text><page sequence="1">210 JSAH, L:2, JUNE 1991 the reader is that Harry Thaw may have inadvertently done White a favor by shooting him that balmy June night when both attended the opening of Mamzelle Champagne at White's own Madison Square Garden. Regrettably, the coverage of White's architecture falls well below the high standard set in the purely biographical passages. The social analysis is rich; the architectural analysis is meager. A great deal is revealed about White's clients, particularly their social interconnections, but there is, as in Baker's earlier Richard Morris Hunt (Cambridge, 1980), a marked lack of awareness of, or interest in, architectural matters. In discussing the rebuilding of Jefferson's Rotunda at Charlottesville, for example, we are told that "a new fireproof roof was built as a dome" (p. 226), but there is no mention that this was a Guastavino tile dome to ensure its resistance to future fires. Nor is there any mention of the fantastic intersecting paraboloidal Guastavino vaults that White proposed in his plan for West Point. Too often the discussion of buildings jumps across time periods, making any perception of the morphological development of White's ar- chitecture almost impossible. Perhaps readers should not expect an interest in White's pro- fessional life, for as the subtitle indicates, Baker's is an account of The Gilded Life of Stanford White. As the book progresses, the reader feels White's social whirl accelerating until his life, as White himself declared in a letter, was "more like hell than anything else" (p. 354). How White managed to get any worth- while designing done at all might be a reasonable reaction on the part of a reader unfamiliar with the buildings White actually did complete. Perhaps the greatest fault of this book is that, while it will certainly appeal to those interested in the prurient aspects of White's life, it will most likely fail to persuade those unfamiliar with White's architecture to examine the buildings more closely. When the architecture is discussed by Baker, it is often presented principally as the decorative instrumentation of the clients' social climbing. Perhaps, in this, Baker's book is less a reflection of the 1890s than of the 1980s, when so much American urban architecture was merely gaudy staging created by self-aggrandizing financial manipulators. It might be hoped that Lawrence Wodehouse's book would be better than Baker's. Certainly his study, published in the Garland Series of Outstanding Theses in the Fine Arts from British Universities, focuses on White's architecture. Presented to the University of Saint Andrews in 1980, it was revised for publication in the series. It is not clear, however, whether the White materials deposited at the Avery Library were consulted, or if the Saarinen papers at the Archives of American Art were examined. In too many respects the sources consulted are the standard ones, leading to such old (and misinformed) conclu- sions as that the World's Columbian Exposition was classical in style because "Easterners imposed pristine white Classicism upon Chicago in 1893" (p. 6), when in fact it was a conscious decision made by all the architects, including Sullivan, to create the greatest uniformity throughout the ensemble. There is also confusion about such facts as the origin of White's name, for where Wodehouse asserts that Stanford was named after his grandfather's brother, Baker claims that the name came from David Stanford, a close friend of Richard Grant White who was asked to be the boy's godfather. No conclusive proof is given by either author to settle the matter. Wodehouse's study suffers from even more organizational disjointedness than does Baker's: in chapter 1, after briefly describing how Stanford White and Bessie Springs Smith met in the early 1880s, Wodehouse jumps to a lengthy description of their summer home at Box- Hill, Smithtown, as well as their city residence on Grammercy Square, both extensively remodeled in the first years of the twentieth century to reflect White's taste in interior design toward the end of his life. Wodehouse's study is best in treating White's clients. The most satisfactory discussions focus on the relationship between White and the Mackays, particularly Katherine Duer Mackay, in the design, construction, and embellishment of their Long Island home, Harbor Hill. This material is essentially a repe- tition of his essay on the Mackays published in Winterthur Port- folio (XI, 1976). Another plus is an appended list of White's commissions and designs, grouped by building type. Less satisfactory are the later chapters of Wodehouse's book, which discuss White's buildings in stylistic categories, again necessitating jarring chronological leaps. It seems difficult to understand how the treatment of the Villard house, and the contribution of Joseph Morrill Wells to this pivotal design, can be concluded without any recognition of the new evidence presented in publications already five years old, especially Wil- liam C. Shopsin and Mosette G. Broderick, The Villard Houses: Life Story ofa Landmark (New York, 1980). Although admittedly Wodehouse wishes to focus on White the architect, it is most surprising that he should discuss White's murder, the subse- quent vilification, and the resurrection of White's artistic rep- utation in a chapter of only two pages! In the concluding chapter, dealing with the later critical perception of White's work and of academic classicism in general, there is no mention of any of the publications that appeared following the Beaux-Arts ar- chitecture exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1975, most especially Richard Guy Wilson's essays in The American Renaissance (New York, 1979). Most grievous of all is the comparatively low quality of pro- duction and information in relation to the high cost of the book. That writers today work with word processors on computers is nearly a given, but it is an insult to the potential reader that Wodehouse's manuscript was printed for photoduplication by Garland on a nine-pin dot matrix machine incapable of properly producing descenders. Additionally aggravating is the combi- nation of software and printer that was unable to print European language characters. Here and there a few accents were drawn in by hand, but this seems to have been a hit-or-miss undertak- ing. It is an affront to ask $110 for this kind of presentation. Although we can learn much about White as bon vivant and designer from these two books, particularly Baker's, the task of reevaluating White as an architect remains to be done. The mass of White's papers and letters at the Avery Library will need to be sifted again with a view to understand the buildings and the evolution of their design, and another study written, before we will get to know White the architect as a complete man.

MOLLMAN, editor, Louis Sullivan in the Art In- stitute of Chicago: The Illustrated Catalogue of Collections, New York: Garland, 1989, 302 illus. $180.00. The new edition of Louis Sullivan's System of Architectural Ornament According with a Philosophy of Man's Powers (1924), sponsored by the Art Institute of Chicago, is one of the most beautiful architecture books produced lately, folio-size and im- peccably printed on heavy-stock paper. Not only is this an ex- traordinarily handsome volume, but, more to the point, it offers new, important insights into Sullivan's system of ornamenta- tion, and these are clarified and expanded in a competent essay by Lauren Weingarden. No book could be a more welcome addition to the Sullivan bibliography, given the current icon- ographical trend in his scholarship, a trend admirably summa- rized by Robert Twombly in the opening sentences of his Louis Sullivan: His Life and Work (1986): "Had anyone asked Louis Sullivan what he was in a word, and had he been willing to answer, he might have said he was a poet, perhaps an artist, but probably not an architect.... His buildings were, to be sure, calculated solutions for practical problems arising from mundane matters. But they were also the working out of instincts and inspirations about the nature of those problems. Least of all were Louis Sullivan's buildings about themselves." Sullivan's intellectual interests were broad, and each of them had a bearing on his iconography, but two stand out above all: Emanuel Swedenborg and Herbert Spencer. One of Sullivan's lifelong interests was to master an architectural expression of Swedenborg's correspondences. According to Swedenborg-the eighteenth-century Swedish mystic, philosopher, and scien- tist-love and wisdom are God's most important attributes; they emanate from Him and sustain the universe. He also believed that universal rationality, or wisdom, comes into harmony with the masculine principle of the cosmos, and emotion, or love, with the feminine. Since to Swedenborg the realms of the phys- ical and the spiritual were part of a transcendent totality, he posited that correspondences of wisdom-love, reason-emotion, and masculine-feminine existed between the two spheres. From such concepts, Sullivan finally learned that the heroism he sought as a result of becoming one with nature could be achieved only by accepting the dictates of the universal law; by striking a balance, not so much of sophia and agape, but of reason and emotion; and by expressing these in art as masculinity and fem- ininity. In that scheme, the feminine was superior to the mas- culine, and Sullivan's great aspiration was to allow the feminine element in design-the gorgeousness of the building-to dom- inate the composition completely, and to conceal the masculine- rational sense of geometry that sustains it and gives it order. Nature behaved similarly: the leaves and flowers of a shrub conceal the branches that give it measure, order, and rhythm. Transcendentalizing Herbert Spencer's mechanistic concep- tion of the universe was Sullivan's other major iconographical goal. To Spencer, matter, motion, and force were the constants of a universe mechanically conceived. He believed that force produced motion, that motion determined the diffusion of mat- ter, and that, conversely, concentration of matter slowed down motion. Fundamental cycles of evolution and dissolution grew out of each other, and this continuous creation of the universe was "the law that transcends proof." Sullivan extolled these concepts with fanatical zeal because he thought that they brought objective validity and scientific verification to ideas that in reality came from the transcendentalism that suffused his romanticism. To him, Spencer's philosophy sanctioned the belief that the subjective and the objective evolve into each other and are in- terchangeable because they are both reflections of the same transcendent rhythms. Lifting himself up to the level of Natura naturans, in his architecture Sullivan sought to evoke ideas of mineral, plant, and animal through geomorphism, phytomor- phism, and anthropomorphism, and to express the three natural realms in ways that seemed as if each evolved out of the other two in rhythms that brought new dimensions to Spencer's con- ceptions. In his "Essay on Inspiration" (1886)-possibly the most succinct statement of his beliefs-Sullivan came to the conclusion that nature's secret lay beyond a progression of life to death to life again. The elemental rhythm sustaining the all in all led him to "the strangely complex thought of rhythm- for all is rhythm" (Sullivan, "Essay on Inspiration," in Narciso G. Menocal, Architecture as Nature: The Transcendentalist Idea of Louis Sullivan [Madison, Wis., 1981], p. 166). Sullivan first achieved an iconography expressing a synthesis of ideas of Swedenborg and Spencer in his ornamental designs of the late 1880s; developed it further in his skyscraper designs of the 1890s; and finally gained its splendid maturation in his twentieth-century banks. In one of the most consciously am- biguous architectural iconographies ever devised, he forced el- ements of his architecture to express their objectively functional character while symbolizing at the same time opposing subjec- tive meanings at levels deeper than ever before envisaged. Be- cause the signification of the elements of his architecture shifts constantly from one meaning to another, the observer's under- standing of each element alternates from the objective to the subjective, from the real to the imagined, from the ponderous to the soaring. But the system is even richer. While ambiguities of meaning may be shifting from the objective to the subjective on one level, the subjective signification, within itself, may concurrently be changing meaning on another level. Such may be the case, for example, with a pier, which may express com- pression at the same time that it seems to soar. Yet, while that pier is acting simultaneously in both categories of the objective and the subjective, it may be expressing as well two other op- posite subjective meanings. Its dominant color, brown, may express masculinity; the gorgeousness of its polychromy, fem- ininity. Making the iconographic ambiguity even richer, the browns of that pier also accord with a subjective representation of the Midwestern landscape. The observer realizes all these meanings, not at the same time, but one after another. Thus, appreciation of Sullivan's architecture becomes as rhythmic as his adaptation of Spencer's theories. One thing becomes another to evolve into a third. Attaining such an iconography was Sul- livan's highest achievement. Embedding symbol within symbol and change within change, his work stands for the essential rhythm that supports the cosmos; it rushes toward "the mind's native land," as Mallarme put it when describing something entirely different. The present edition reveals A System of Architectural Ornament as Sullivan intended it to be: as the statement of a system of iconography that he believed to be universal because he saw it as a reflection of that of nature. The story of how the work developed is well known. A group of Chicago architects, all Sullivan's fellow members at the Cliff Dwellers Club, "con-</page><page sequence="3">212 JSAH, L:2, JUNE 1991 ceived the idea that he should perpetuate his name and philos- ophy in some enduring form" (p. 7). The Burnham Library of the Art Institute was brought into the project, as well as Charles Whitaker, editor of the Press of the American Institute of Ar- chitects. The result was that publication, well known to archi- tectural historians, in which Sullivan synthesized his ideas on ornamentation and illustrated them with twenty plates of pro- digious design. Sullivan wanted the original edition with re- productions in halftone, but because of technical difficulties, not to say cost, Whitaker, who became in charge of the project, chose a linecut process printed in gray ink. Sullivan came to detest the plates, finding them dull and dead rather than alive and breathing in their own atmosphere. All subsequent editions of A System have reproduced the plates of the original edition. Happily, the present edition does not. By choosing a two-color process for reproduction-which is even better than the one Sullivan intended-each slight foxing of the paper and each nuance of Sullivan's pencil become amazingly clear. Further- more, for the first time, as John Zukowsky states in the preface, all thirty-six 81/2 x 11 in. sheets of Sullivan's holograph text and sketches are reproduced as full-scale facsimiles, each on a right-hand page. Since the accompanying left-hand page carries the text in print noting all of Sullivan's editorial corrections and emendations, the reader can easily reconstruct Sullivan's thought processes. But of course, the glory of this edition is the twenty drawings of A System, superbly reproduced for the first time in full, albeit not full size (the original drawings are 29 x 233/4 in.), but with all the text and titles that Sullivan rightly con- sidered to be of capital importance, and which were expunged from all previous editions, including the first. If only for this, we should be grateful to the Art Institute for the present edition because now Sullivan's intentions emerge clearly. The thesis of Weingarden's essay is the only correct one, in my opinion, and she unfolds it masterfully. She states that Sul- livan meant the drawings in A System "to illustrate systemati- cally a literary treatise concerning the metaphysical origins and philosophical principles of his design procedure" (p. 11). She also posits that "to guide the reader to a metaphysical under- standing of his exegesis, Sullivan arranged his treatise verbally and visually as a gradual transition from the conceptual to the perceptual" (p. 12). According to Weingarden, Sullivan linked his system to an aesthetic theory of the creative process, and he developed it in three phases: the sensory, the spiritual, and the practical. Each phase follows an evolutionary pattern where the inorganic be- comes organic, the ideal becomes real, and the subjective be- comes objective. Concerning the plates of A System, Weingar- den notes that in the drawings Sullivan translated the dialectical synthesis of the objective and the subjective into a system of visual symbols by making use of a duality of geometric elements and naturalistic botanical motifs. Beginning with plates 1 and 2, Sullivan introduced the square and leaf forms "as the ele- mental syntax of the inorganic and the organic, [and] from then on he used Spencer's law to define organic growth as the gradual, dialectical process through which the simple becomes complex, the indefinite becomes definite, and polar opposites attain dy- namic equilibrium" (p. 15). Sullivan developed further his ideas on the inorganic-organic duality in plates 3 and 4, and now, in this new edition of A System, we come to know his intentions fully. Inasmuch as this edition publishes for the first time all the different blocks of Sullivan's text that had been deleted previously, we finally have Sullivan's all-important definition of morphology. To Sullivan, "morphology is a process whereby an original form gradually changes into another form" (p. 124). Here we have a further validation of the many transcendentalist interpretations of Sul- livan's work with which some of us have been involved. The previously deleted titles of plates 5 and 6 also teach us much. Five is "The Value of Axes [Life is Infinite]," and 6 is "Manipulation of Variants in a Given Axial Theme"-theory and practice, as it were. Furthermore, now that Sullivan's def- inition of morphology has been made available to us, his state- ment on plate 5 gains new life because it now has a fuller meaning. Sullivan wrote: "Any line straight or curved, may be considered an axis, and therefore a container of energy, and directrix of power. There is no limit to variations or combi- nations, or to the morphology possible" (p. 128). That is to say, in ornamental design, axes are the determinants of morphology; they are like ever-growing branches shooting out leaves and blossoms, as well as new branches, which become new axes by themselves. The third step in Sullivan's program (after showing the du- ality of the organic and the inorganic and the morphological importance of axes) was to devote the rest of the treatise, be- ginning on plate 7, to what he called "the doctrine of paral- lelism" (p. 133). Parallelism, to Sullivan, was far more than a geometrical device to establish rhythm and measure-although it was that as well. He considered it to be "mystical." By what Sullivan saw as "the powers of the imaginative will," man becomes co-creator; "his creations are but parallels of himself," as well as expressions of "the parallelism between man and nature" (p. 137). In architecture, parallelism is expressed geo- metrically and, more profoundly so, in curvaceous rhythms of ornamentation. Moreover, by stressing the importance of par- allelism through word and drawing, and by insisting on the existence-and even mystery-of hidden morphological rhythms of growth, dissolution, and new growth, Sullivan, without so stating, brought A System full circle in his theory and returned to the beginning, to the "Essay on Inspiration," to "the complex thought of rhythm-for all [or the all in all] is rhythm." Weingarden also goes into the question of "sources," and her essay becomes less interesting there. While her argument that during his year at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts Sullivan became aware of Charles Blanc's Grammaire des arts du dessin (1867) is cogent, and he may well have been influenced by it, it may be too much to say that under Blanc's influence Sullivan became a Neoplatonist. One usually thinks of a Neoplatonist as a person who generally seeks the expression of the ideal, often even to the exclusion of the characteristic. Sullivan, ever the romantic, always sought an expression of the character of the building he had at hand, never of the pure archetype; and in this respect Sullivan's interest in typology should not be confused with a search for the archetype. Along this vein, Weingarden-applying her previous re- search-also considers Ruskin as a Sullivan source. It is possible that Weingarden, here, may be reading too much in what may be a mere superficial similarity. Weingarden bases her argument on statements Ruskin made in Modern Painters. While it is un- deniable that some of Ruskin's pronouncements in Modern Pain-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 213 ters have a curious Sullivanesque avant la lettre ring to them, it remains to be proven that Sullivan ever read Modern Painters. It is well known that Ruskin was anything but systematic, and his statements on ornamentation in The Seven Lamps of Architecture (the one Ruskin book Sullivan may have read) are in opposition to Sullivan's theories because of Ruskin's insistence in Seven Lamps on a mimetic conception of ornamentation in reference to nature. Sullivan never sought to imitate the appearance of nature per se; his aim, as Weingarden herself reminds us in her essay, was to imitate nature's process of creation; his was the ecstasy of the "co-creator." One reason that it is difficult to gauge the extent of Weingarden's belief in how pervasive these influences were on Sullivan is that in her epilogue she comes to no conclusion about them. Readers, therefore, are left free to interpret at will the author's beliefs. Since Weingarden does not circumscribe Blanc's and Ruskin's influences on Sullivan in her interpretation, the reader-at least this one-has no choice but to question whether her avowal of these influences goes beyond acceptable confines. In spite of these shortcomings, Weingarden's essay is indeed a welcome addition to the Sullivan bibliography. Her recon- struction of Sullivan's process of creating A System approaches virtuosity, and it is an excellent complement to this edition of A System of Architectural Ornament, the one that surely will be considered definitive for many years to come. John Zukowsky and the Art Institute of Chicago are to be warmly congratulated for their superb effort. The other book under review, Louis Sullivan in the Art In- stitute of Chicago: The Illustrated Catalogue of Collections, edited by Sarah C. Mollman, former assistant editor for art and architec- ture at the Art Institute, and currently assistant editor at Inland Architect, is another effort of the department of architecture of that museum. As the title implies, this is an illustrated catalogue of the collections. Rather than following the internal logic of Sullivan's devel- opment (as I, for one, would have preferred), the material was divided into five sections following the order in which it is filed in the museum. The first section, "Architectural Drawings by Sullivan, D. Adler and Co., Adler and Sullivan and Successor Firms"-with 103 illustrations of twenty-seven buildings and projects-presents us with a rich collection of working drawings and blueprints spanning from the John M. Brunswick andJulius Balke Factory, Warehouse, and Lumber-Drying Plant (1881- 1883) to the facade of the William C. Presto Music Store (1922), Sullivan's last executed commission. Included in this collection are the drawings for the Standard Club (1887-1888) and its addition (1892); some ornamental drawings for the Auditorium Building; the George M. Harvey house (with Queen Anne gables that remind us of Frank Lloyd Wright's Oak Park house of the following year); the plans and elevations of the Schiller Building (1890-1892); the plans of the Victoria Hotel (how much did Wright have to do with the elevations?); and the elusive facade for a hotel (c. 1892-1893), where winged figures appear for the first time under the eaves of a Sullivan design. There are also later projects: the People's Savings Bank and St. Paul's Methodist-Episcopal Church (1911-1912), both in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; the project for the Carl Bennett house (1911- 1912), Owatonna, Minnesota; the Van Allen Store (1913-1915), Clinton, Iowa; the Merchants' National Bank (1913-1915), Grinnell, Iowa; the Home Building Association Company (1914- 1915), Newark, Ohio; the Farmers' and Merchants' Union Bank (1919), Columbus, Wisconsin; and the already-mentioned Krause Music Store facade. The second section, "Architectural Drawings by Sullivan As- sociates and Followers"-with forty-four illustrations of thir- teen buildings and projects-presents work by Dankmar Adler subsequent to the dissolution of Adler and Sullivan, by Parker Noble Berry, and by Homer Grant Sailor. Of interest in this section is Adler's Isaiah Temple, an 1898 design that stylistically harks back to the 1870s. The intensely Sullivanesque design of Berry is well represented by five projects, and the more pedes- trian style of Sailor by three. A design sketch for the facade of an unidentified building to be located at Forty-eighth and Champlain Streets, Chicago, is listed as "possibly an indepen- dent Frank Lloyd Wright project" (p. 122). The third section, "Architectural Fragments," lists the fifty- three pieces of Sullivan ornament in the museum and carries fifty-three illustrations, but not all items are illustrated; some of the pictures are of the buildings from which the fragments came. All the familiar and not-so-familiar pieces are there. Among the latter are fragments from the Rothschild Store (1880-1881), the Jewelers' Building (1881-1882), the Rosenfeld Building (1881-1882), the Selz house (1883), and some little-known pieces from the Chicago Auditorium. Among the familiar pieces are the outstanding reconstruction of the Chicago Stock Ex- change Building Trading Room and the standard assortment of elevator grilles, door knobs, cast-iron stair railings, and terra- cotta fragments. The fourth section-with ninety-six illustrations of ninety- six drawings-consists of "Non-Architectural Drawings." The twenty plates of Sullivan's System of Architectural Ornament are there as well as a collection of assorted drawings. Salient among those are twelve sketch copies by Sullivan of composite orna- ment from Ruprich-Robert's Flore ornamentale (c. 1875), his studies of the orders after a French edition of Vignola (also c. 1875), sketches of grotesque heads, his Paris pen-and-ink draw- ings of cocottes and brothel scenes, and his numerous 1878 and 1879 sketches of nude men and women in classical pose. A charming drawing inscribed "To my Grandmother" (1867) and a map of Maine (1868) attest to Sullivan's childhood ability as a draftsman. The fifth section-with only four pictures illustrating 2 out of 202 items-is a catch-all labeled "The Sullivaniana Collec- tion, the Van Allen Correspondence, the Whitaker Correspon- dence, Bound Manuscripts and Plates, and Medals." It remains unclear to me why, in this section, with its wealth of materials, the editor chose to illustrate only a 1912 letter of Parker Noble Berry to his father and the commemorative medal awarded to Adler and Sullivan for their participation in the World's Co- lumbian Exposition. With the publication of Louis Sullivan in the Art Institute of Chicago and Louis Sullivan: A System of Architectural Ornament- two very important books that will become indispensable to Sullivan scholars and to students of American architecture-the Art Institute of Chicago continues to assert the fact that it has the most productive department of architecture of any museum in the nation.
