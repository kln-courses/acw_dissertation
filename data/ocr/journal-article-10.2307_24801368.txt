<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Life and Writings of Edmond Pezet (1923-2008) Pierre Gillet, SAM In the context of Buddhist-Christian dialogue in Thailand, the life and writings of Fr. Edmond Pezet (1923—2008) are remarkable. He lived among the poor and in a Buddhist monastery, and he also experienced the eremitic life in the forest. Accord ing to the Indian Zen master Ama Samy, "Pezet gained an intimate experience and knowledge of Buddhism by living with Thai monks." Here I introduce a recent Soci ety of the Auxiliaries of the Mission (SAM)1 work that offers a biography and some writings of Edmond Pezet, Edmond Pezet, a Priest among Buddhist Monks in Thailand.2 This publication is a collection of various writings of Edmond Pezet: correspon dence and nine articles published in various magazines in French, Thai, and English. It has been edited by Henri Huysegoms, a Zen practitioner in Japan for the last forty five years, and Pierre Liesse, an activist who worked for a couple of years in Thailand. These authors have been impressed by two characteristics of Pezet. First, because he was born in a very poor family in rural France, Pezet identified himself with poor people working hard to earn their living. Second, he was a very committed scholar who successfully learned to speak English, Thai, Lao, Sanskrit, and Pali. Edmond Pezet did his military service in Vietnam, where he was the helpless wit ness of torture committed by his regiment fellows on Vietminh suspects. This led him to return there in the future as a missionary, to compensate for the harm he saw caused to the Vietnamese people. Back in France, he completed his study of theol ogy. In 1947, his father was crushed by a truck in front of his eyes. He managed to combine his study and work on the land to provide for his family's needs. He served as a priest in the diocese of Cahors (France) for a few years. Afterwards, he joined SAM in Belgium. At the end of 1956, he was sent in the northeastern part of Thailand. Faithful to the objectives of SAM, he wanted to serve the local bishop unconditionally, but he quickly noticed a painful reality. Christians and clergy alike followed "a religion, with a dreamlike heaven, rose-water-scented, as its goal, and, in order to get there without fail, certain 'tricks,' recipes, ceremonies and representations accompanied by a goodly number of rags and trimmings, where one cannot very easily see the connection between the two things."3 He wrote that he was stunned to see the way religion was taught to catechumens. They were asked to assimilate, by memorizing Buddhist-Christian Studies 34 (2014) 195-198. © by University of Hawai'i Press.

This inadequate education went hand in hand with a lack of knowledge of Buddhism, sometimes accompanied by scorn. "The Christians were deliberately uprooted from the spiritual richness and religious experience of their race . . . especially the clergy! (kept apart from their people from the age of 10 to 27). They were taught to administer on the model of the French parish priest of last century."4 His Thai bishop, to whom he opened his heart, did not see any problem in that situation and advised him to get used to it, but for Pezet it soon became unbearable. In 1970, Pezet's life took a decisive turn. He went to Bangkok. There, he learned Sanskrit and Buddhism at the university level, and for three years lived in the house of a Buddhist monk, helping him to write introductions to Buddhism for foreigners. It made him discover a world of spiritual wealth he had not suspected. What he learned was not a new doctrine presented as absolute truth, because Bud dhism does not present its core teaching that way, but a "doctrine" that is expressed exclusively in existential values, something not to be taught, but experienced. Bud dhism, he discovered, does not deal with transcendence, because it does not engage in speculative discussion. In Buddhism, this transcendence can only be perceived in the depth of immanence. In a letter of that time, he noted that his bishop had warned him not to convert to Buddhism, but he added: "Yes, I am 'Buddhist,' just as I am Thai at heart, like 'them,' and I won't become any more so . . . but I know what I mean by that: and as a result I am only more consciously in Christ. I know that the wisdom of the Buddha is no more outside the Spirit of Christ than any human spiritual wealth ... In fact, I believe that a Christian Buddhist must draw on the insights of the Buddha (and of India) to find new treasures in Christ's message."' In 1974, Pezet traveled extensively in India and spent six months in the monas tery of Chevetogne in Belgium to discover the spirituality of the Eastern Orthodox churches. In his view, this eastern spirituality was much more attuned to the Indo Thai culture. Coming back to Bangkok in 1975, Pezet found a political situation in turmoil. The Thai government had ordered all foreigners to be gathered in one place near Ubon in the North. He thus joined a group of forest hermits for three years, and this gave him a new experience and insight into monastic life. The next year, 1976, while visiting his previous parish, he spent an evening with a group of Christians, narrating his experience. The following day, the parishioners built a hermitage for him and asked him to become their monk. He was accepted and lived there, collecting his rice in the morning and meditating in the Buddhist way. In 1979, he was moved by the terrible situation of the Khmer refugee camps near his place along the Thai—Cambodia border, and he worked there in the filth, among the sick and the dying people: a real nightmare. The Catholic diocese in which he had worked wished to create a big monastery to compete with the Buddhist monks. Pezet refused this option and had finally to leave Thailand and come back to France. There, he was busy translating various books like Un bouddhiste dit le christianisme aux bouddhistes, written by the Venerable Buddhadasa</page><page sequence="3">NEWS AND VIEWS 197 Bhikku. For two years, 1987—1989, he came back to Thailand as a retired man and wrote, at the request of his friend Fr. Coster, various leaflets in Thai language present ing Christianity to Thai Buddhists. He died in France in 2008. REMARKS ON PEZET S WRITINGS Let us now outline the Buddhist path as Pezet presented it in his writings. He at first sought to clarify some misunderstandings and to explain that the way of the Buddha can, to a great extent, enrich and strengthen faithfulness to the way of Jesus. Whoever tries to define the existence of a Supreme Being puts this Being as an object in front of an "I." But Buddhism denounces this dualism. The absolute cannot be posited as an object, and the "I" that is asserted is illusory. Buddhism, speaking of "non-self," does not, however, deny the personality: The most radical, non-theistic Buddhism, the 'path of non-self,' of empti ness,' which seems to dispense with any 'personal' value, in theory at least, in fact only seeks to 'empty out' the inappropriate and egocentric attachment to one's individual 'self,' as elevated into an absolute value. The values of what we call 'the person' are designated 'non-self.' This should not be interpreted as a negation or denial of 'self,' but as the transformation of the individual self, its reversal. It is the negation of egocentrism, kenosis, 'emptiness,' (An-Atta).6 Meditation as practiced in dialogue should lead to contemplation. This is the only way to overcome a dualistic view of reality. It is only by the faithful practice of medi tation that does not become attached to any thought, even the most valuable one, that we can discover naked reality in its mystery. It is to this depth in inner dialogue that the dialogue with a "You," the supreme interlocutor of "I," should lead. This way of immanence was called by St. Augustine as "God more intimate to me than I am to myself." By becoming one with the depths of one's being we can, like Moses, come out of the "Cloud of Unknowing" unwittingly transfigured: The spiritual attended in amazement at an unveiling. To him has been given to see suddenly the truth (the meaning) of things of life. After that, we cannot be like before. Yet, though, everything is the same, as the 'spiritual' is not some one who is apart. [. . .] The Absolute keeps its whole mystery. What he gives to see is the meaning of things, their ultimate meaning, and their ultimate truth for us. This is the meaning of the Absolute experienced by us. To realize the Absolute in our lives, that is the Way. f. . .] This is already making the Divine alive, in its existential reflection experienced by us through imitation, which is participation; this is all that can be done now. But isn't this not enough? [. . .] Whatever the word used to mean the Unspeakable, the 'Unspeakable' is not said. It is above all names! Knowing this, it is not illegitimate to talk, like the Bible or Christ himself, in an anthropomorphic about God, if it is hum bly, without any pretence, aware of our limitations. Faith is always humble; it is rational speculation which is always tempted, or otherwise, of not being humble.7</page><page sequence="4">198 BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES This last quote shows how Buddhism can help us to free ourselves from our tendency to consider our views as absolute truth. Beliefs desecrate the mystery of the ultimate. The purification and self-denial recommended by the Buddhists can make us perceive the "uncovered" reality that is there in the nakedness of its mystery and lead us to a more humble fidelity to the way shown by Jesus in order to fulfil our humanity. According to Pezet, if we consider Buddhism and Christianity as religions, a dia logue between them is unthinkable for the reason that dialogue is possible only in the case of beings of the same kind. Christianity teaches some truths to be believed. Buddhism does not hold any, he asserted: "If it is true that enriching encounter and dialogue is only possible between like and like, it must seem obvious that there is nothing to be gained from attempts at dialogue with Buddhism, whether on the basis of our religious beliefs, or of our dogmatic canons, or of our theories of systematic theology or scholastic philosophy—for the simple reason that, from the viewpoint of the Buddhist interlocutor, these things are of little importance or interest."8 For him, Buddhists and Christians can only truly converge by faithfully pursuing the path to self-emptying. True dialogue should be a quest for final truth based on a life in accor dance with our deepest nature. Pezet recalls for us that contemplative life is the ideal place for an encounter between practitioners of the way of the Buddha and of Christ. This alone will create real intercommunion.
