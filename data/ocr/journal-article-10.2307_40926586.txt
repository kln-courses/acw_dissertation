<plain_text><page sequence="1">Between Athlos and Arbeit: Myth, Labor, and Cement Devin Fore Against those reveling in the demise of Utopian discourse at the end of the Cold War, Andreas Huyssen made the unfashionable claim fifteen years ago that utopia was still with us. Even a cursory glance at developments in the cultural landscape since then- from Fredric Jameson's massive volume on uto- pia, Archaeologies of the Future, to the peripatetic art installation project Uto- pia Station- would seem to confirm the accuracy of Huyssen's prognostic. At the moment when capitalism had lost its great ideological other, the Soviet Empire, the noplace of utopia assumed the latter's function as a cache of alter- native social designs within the post-Cold War world order. But this transi- tion did not leave the contents of utopia unaffected. As Huyssen explained, this transition reversed the polarity of utopia, as it were, making the past into the site of its investments rather than the future. With the demise of the east- ern bloc, Utopian thought turned back the clock and began to focus on what Huyssen called "memories of utopia." This shift from a "futuristic pole toward the pole of remembrance" pursued what is, in effect, a nostalgic variant of uto- pianism. "In this search for history, the exploration of the noplaces, the exclu- sions, the blind spots on the maps of the past is often invested with Utopian energies very much oriented toward the future."1 1.

With the exhaustion of certain neo-avant-garde impulses that were the legacy of a futurist-oriented modernism, the tempo- rality of Utopian discourse began to mutate already in the 1960s, when his- tory and the past became central loci in the work of several German artists and authors. Among the cultural producers named in Huyssen's discussion of this "return of history" in the 1970s is the German Democratic Republic (GDR) playwright Heiner Müller, one of the leading agents, as Huyssen suggests, in this "confrontation of history and fiction, history and representation, history and myth."2 Indeed, Müller offered a succinct formula for this nostalgic uto- pianism when he once characterized his work as "a memory of the future."3 Taking Huyssen's observations about the retrospective orientation of Uto- pian thinking in the 1970s as a point of departure, this essay considers Mül- ler's specific contribution to this transformation of the Utopian imaginary. It focuses, in particular, on Müller's use of myth. If Müller's works from the 1970s already anticipate positions that were articulated fully only after the official end of the Cold War and the removal of all remaining barriers to global capi- talism more than twenty years later, this is because Müller recognized from within East Germany that capitalism's great ideological other had already dis- appeared long before 1991. The works that Müller wrote during and in the wake of the Neues Ökonomisches System der Planung und Leitung (New Economic System of Plan and Control, or NES), which was a Party policy implemented in 1963 to restructure the GDR's economy according to the principle of self- regulation and post-Fordist methods of flexible production, registered the destruction of socialism already in the 1960s. For Müller, the NES's updated and modernized version of technocratic "socialism" was indistinguishable from state-administered capitalism. It was, as he put it, "the canonization of wretch- edness, the birth of a caricature of 'real existing socialism.'"4 Müller's response was to rewrite classics of antiquity such as Oedipus Rex (1967), Philoctetes (1968), and Prometheus (1969). The NES inaugu- rated the period conventionally known in Müller scholarship as the play- wright's "mythical" period. Against the background of the NES, his preoc- cupation with myth during these years could not have been more untimely or unwelcome, so stark was the contrast between Müller's archaicisms and the 2.

His deployment of ancient myth was a trenchant critique of this blind enthusiasm for technocratic prog- ress. Because of its inherent anthropomorphism, myth raises the question of the human body's status in modern systems of rationalized labor. Miiller's retelling of the stories of Hercules and Prometheus, for example, resituates the feats of these ancient heroes within the NES's mechanized regime of produc- tion and thereby foregrounds the repressed moment of the NES- namely, the human origins of labor and value. Against the NES's shiny cybernetic and fully automated future, Müller's insertion of figurai myth into modern pro- duction processes insists on the ineradicable human component of work. At issue in Miiller's surrealistic encounters between industrial machine and myth- ical hero is the relationship between modern production and living, figurai labor, which is grounded in the worker's body. This confrontation between the NES and myth plays out the dialectic of abstraction and anthropomor- phism that, according to Karl Marx, organizes the division of labor. At the same time that he explores the dialectic of labor and technol- ogy on the level of the content of his mythical plays, Müller also conceives of myth as itself a force of production. And so, while the first half of the pres- ent essay considers myths of labor, the second half considers myth as labor. Made of accumulated cognitive labor, collective experience, and practical knowledge, myth is, Müller wrote, "an aggregate, a machine, onto which other new machines can always be coupled."5 It is a powerful noetic resource, Hans Blumenberg notes in his massive study on myth as a cultural technology, Work on Myth.6 Müller was interested, specifically, in the dialogue that myth makes possible across historical time. It contains transmissions from the deep past. From this "utopia in reverse"- to borrow another formulation from Huyssen7- myth becomes in Müller the medium for a necromantic conversa- tion between living and dead labor. In this regard, Müller's myth-"machine" corrects a certain bias in modernity toward the present. While contemporary society has mastered the aspect of spatial difference through the innumera- ble telecommunication media that allow us to manipulate space and distance at will, myth reminds us that our facility with temporal difference remains woefully underdeveloped. In a society that has lost its sense of history, Müller deploys myth to cultivate temporal difference and make possible a dialogue across time. 5.

Returning in 1920 from the civil war to Pleasant Colony, his hometown on the Black Sea, the Bolshe- vik Gleb Chumalov heads directly to the plant, ready for work, but finds that the townspeople have converted the abandoned cement factory into a stall for livestock, which is now overgrown with weeds and smells of manure. Like the fifteen million lives lost in the civil war, the factory, too, is a casu- alty of the conflict that reduced the industrial capacity of Russia to less than 20 percent of its prerevolutionary levels. The campaign to reopen the cement factory sets off Cemenfs plot, which follows the Bildung (education) of the hotheaded revolutionary Gleb as he must learn to reconcile his prerevolu- tionary habits with the new social forms emerging in the reconstruction era. In the postromantic age of Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP), Gleb must temper his rash impulses and master less obviously revolutionary forms of labor such as party organizing and bureaucratic management. These less spec- tacular modes of production appear in Cement alongside the wild orgies of shock labor and voluntarist excesses of the entusiasty that were the stock-in- trade of the production novel as a genre. Into Gladkov's reconstruction narrative Müller interpolates several mythical narratives. For example, he transforms Gleb's homecoming into "The Return of Odysseus," the scene with the engineer Kleist into the "Liberation of Prometheus," and the scene in which Dasha, Gleb's wife, announces the death of their daughter into "Medea Commentary." Müller didn't have to dig very deep to uncover the mythical subtexts, which are already quite pronounced in the socialist-realist original. Already in his 1926 review of the novel, the Russian formalist Osip Brik drew attention to Gladkov's use of mythical pro- totypes such as Hercules and Achilles. Like so many socialist-realist texts, Gladkov's book tries to inscribe itself into a mythical past while simultaneously projecting itself into a mythical future. The u-topic no-place of the factory is historically ambivalent, part prelapsarian Eden and part postapocalyptic wreck- age. The factory building and its quarry are a locus for the forces of reconstruc- tion as well as the site for an archaeological excavation into deeper registers of time. The book consequently has a curiously unresolved time structure, Brik noted, split between the "heroic" time of myth and the "historical" time of everyday existence.8 Its conflicted chronotope, to use Mikhail Bakhtin's term for the time-space matrix of a text, oscillates unstably between the closed time 8. Osip Brik, "Pochemu ponravilsia Tsement," Na literaturnom postu, no. 2 (1926): 30.</page><page sequence="5">Devin Fore 129 of myth and the unfinished time of the novel. Aware of their dual roles as both characters in a novel and heroes in a legendary tale, Gladkov's charac- ters themselves exhibit a notably metaliterary consciousness about their contri- bution to the project of Soviet mythography. Ivagin, for example, rhapsodizes to Gleb: "Our children will imagine us great heroes, and will create legends about us. ... It will all be reflected in their imagination as an epoch of heroic exploits and titanic achievements. And we- you and I- little grains of dust in an immense mass, we shall seem to them as giants. The past is always general- ized and exaggerated."9 Given the status that Gladkov's text would soon share, along with Maksim Gorky's novel Mother, as the template for all socialist- realist novels, such a prediction- that future generations will idolize them- is all too prescient. Into the already highly mythicized narrative of Gladkov's book, Mül- ler then inserts three additional mythical tableaux that focus on Achilles, Prometheus, and Hercules. Here too production is the theme. These mythical intermedia depict the ancient heroes in acts of labor that become increasingly abstract, as labor detaches itself from the human body and becomes less and less anthropomorphic. In the first intermedium, Müller retells the story of Achilles' slaughter of Hector, emphasizing in his account the ransom of Hec- tor's corpse for gold from his family; then comes Prometheus, whose tale represents the mythic origins of work itself (it was, of course, out of revenge for Prometheus's theft of fire that Zeus hid man's livelihood in the soil and thus delivered mortals over to a finite lifetime of arduous labor); and the last of the mythic intermedia in Cement depicts the confrontation between Hercules (a symbol in the GDR of the proletariat) and the Hydra of Lerna (conversely, a symbol of the bourgeoisie), which, in Müller's retelling, ends not with the tri- umph of the hero but with the unholy biomechanical union of Hercules with the Hydra, proletariat with bourgeoisie. Cement's three mythical intermedia portray turning points in the his- torical development of regimes of modern production. First, the exchange of Hector's body for gold suggests the appearance of money as an instrument of universal equivalency that converts the physical body into abstract value. The theft of fire by Prometheus allegorizes the birth of craft and technology, that is, the inauguration of a system of primitive accumulation that will eventually produce the factory machine as the apotheosis of capital. The interval between the laboring body and the product of its labor is radicalized, then, in the last 9. Fyodor Vasilievich Gladkov, Cement, trans. A. S. Arthur and C.

Over the course of the three intermedia that track the emergence of modern production, the human figure is increasingly attenuated until, with Hercules, it explodes into the space of the stage. Müller depicts with particular vividness and brutality this final stage in the dehumanization of work, where the body is systematically dismembered and assimilated to an alien apparatus. As Hercules tracks his prey, he fol- lows the trail of its blood into a strangely animate forest. At first brushing up against him gently, the trees and branches in this forest soon begin to size up the hero more systematically: "The caress turned into appraisal. As at the tailors' he thought, the branches circled his head, then his neck, his chest, his waist, etc., until they had taken his measurements from head to toe. . . . The automatic nature of the process irritated him. . . . This [forest] was studying his skeleton, the number, strength, arrangement function of the bones, the con- nection of the joints."10 Only when the operation becomes unbearably pain- ful does Hercules realize in his panic that the wood that envelops him is itself the quarry he is stalking, that "the forest which he believed he was walking through had been the beast for a long time." The forest, Hercules dis- covers, is a Taylorist machine designed to extract the labor power from his liv- ing body. "Reduced again and again in steady destruction to his smallest com- ponents" (Müller, Cement, 39), Hercules is absorbed into a space that seems itself to be uncannily alive. The factory machine in which Hercules finds himself begins to calculate and engineer his every movement, and as the hero cedes control of his body to the measuring apparatus that extracts his vitality, the distinction dissolves between him and the Hydra. All agency is blurred. "Adjust to the movements of the enemy. Evade them. Anticipate them. Meet them. Adjust and don't adjust. Adjust by not adjusting. Evade by attacking. Attack by evading" (Müller, Cement, 40). The body of Hercules, the laborer, merges with the machine, and the mythical hero becomes indistinguishable from the stage's very scenography. The playwright Müller depicts modern industry's de-anthropomorphization of labor onstage through the most literal of means, that is, by assimilating the actor to the scenery. This assimilation, this loss of distinction, is reflected in the breakdown of the text's grammar: "In 10. Heiner Müller, Cement, trans. Helen Fehervary, Sue-Ellen Case, and Marc D.

It is clear, then, that the scholarly convention of distinguishing Müller's "production" plays of the 1950s from his "mythical" plays of the 1960s needs to be revised, since he actively sought to undermine this distinction by insert- ing production themes into ancient myths, and vice versa. Müller's retelling of the myths of Achilles, Prometheus, and Hercules as narratives about pro- duction commits an interesting historical anachronism, since ancient myths did not- in fact, could not- depict scenes of labor. The Greeks did not know "labor" as such. Fields were cultivated, houses were built, and textiles were woven in ancient Greece, of course, but for most of antiquity there was no single term to designate all of these activities collectively. Farming, construc- tion, and weaving had no more in common conceptually for the Greeks than swimming, baking, and telephoning do for us. In an essay on the psychology of labor in ancient Greece, Jean-Pierre Vernant observed that the Greeks had no equivalent for our word work.u The word used to characterize Hercules' feats, ponos, applied to any activity involving strenuous effort; a different word, ergon, to work in the fields; and still another, poiesis, to technological manu- facture. Numerous other words in ancient Greek designated distinct productive activities, all of which today would fall under the general category of work but which were fundamentally incommensurable to the ancients. Abstract labor, then, is a thoroughly modern category. The sociologist Oskar Negt has explained the historical development away from an anthropo- morphic context of production toward the modern notion of abstract labor: A farmer in the Middle Ages realized the properties of his labor by inter- acting with the field or with animals, by observing the weather; these were of course all very important labor properties, on which the success of the harvest depended. This farmer had to develop aptitudes and properties that were decisive for the success of his process of production. The properties of this labor were embedded in a working and living community that occurred naturally; they did not exist apart from this context and did not need to find an object through which to be realized. But with the process of primitive 11. Jean-Pierre Vernant, "Some Psychological Aspects of Work in Ancient Greece," in Myth and Thought among the Greeks, trans.

Labor as a category of reality, Arbeit sans phrase, labor as mere labor capacity- that is a modern category.12 The radical nominalism of the Greek lexicon for those diverse activities that, to the modern Western mind, would all qualify as "work" (ponos, ergon, poe- isis) confirms Marx's observation that the emergence of the abstract concept of labor becomes historically possible only in the context of an economy in which every form of work aims to create a product or service destined for circulation in a market structured by universal exchange and relative value. Marx writes that "the example of labor shows strikingly how even the most abstract cat- egories, despite their validity- precisely because of their abstractness- for all epochs, are nevertheless, in the specific character of this abstraction, them- selves likewise a product of historic relations, and possess their full validity only for and within these relations."13 As Vernant shows, the psychological discrepancy between ancient and modern notions of labor is reflected in each culture's respective lexical resources. Thus it is striking to discover that Müller wrote abstract labor, literally, into the language of the myths. He describes, for example, Prometheus's sufferings and Hercules' efforts alike as Arbeit (work). This deliberate anachronism in fact appears in nearly all of Miiller's mythical plays. Thus in Prometheus (1967-68), based on Peter Witzmann's translation of Aeschylus's fifth-century tragedy, Müller generally deviated little from Witzmann's version- with one important exception: Müller's use of Arbeit to translate the Greek athlos, which Aeschylus had used to describe the sufferings of the Titan Prometheus and which Witz- mann translated variously as "struggle," "contest," or "tribulation."14 Müller subsumes all of these diverse acts under the single rubric of "work." In the text's very lexicon, then, Müller reiterates the same process of abstraction that is depicted across the mythical intermedia of Cement. By anachronistically ren- dering the word athlos as Arbeit, Müller turns a concrete, embodied activity into a process that has no connection to the body and its capacities. 12.

If athlos denotes an inherently anthropomor- phic notion of work in which the body is still bound to a concrete context of action, Arbeit belongs to an episteme that no longer presumes this connection between labor and the body. The modern world has lost the connection between production and the body that underpinned the Greek understanding of labor. Vernant has explained, for example, that the ancients considered work nec- essarily bound to the inborn capacities of human anatomy. As Georg Lukács pointed out in his Aesthetics, work was for the Greeks always anthropomor- phic because it was based on slave, that is, human, labor.15 Because, moreover, the Greeks never fully distinguished technical forms from the natural body, they regarded the machine not as an autonomous substance but as an exten- sion of human organs. Vernant explained that, for the Greeks, the technologi- cal object "transmits and amplifies man's force rather than acting by virtue of its own internal structure and producing an effect through a mechanism of a type different from human exertion."16 Gradually, however, technology lost its human contours. Liberated from the immediacy of the anthropic context of production, labor also lost its mimetic foundations, externalized to the point that labor became completely abstract, neither figurai nor figurable. Put into the Taylorist machine, as Müller shows, Hercules is literally disfigured. This constitutes the paradox, the impossibility, of Müller's conjunction of ancient myth and modern production. If, as Blumen- berg observes, "myth has something to do with the nameless being given names, the formless receiving forms, the bestiary becoming human, and that, which is already human in form [des Menschengestaltigen] being humanized," and if the locus of myth is "the origin and continuance of the figure that is man [Menschengestalt]" then this humanist anachronism can have no easy place in modern systems of production.17 Yet Müller insists again and again that the connection between the body and production, between athlos and Arbeit, must be addressed. The body of the worker must be factored into the technocratic schemes of the NES. 15.

There the eponymous hero harnesses and redirects powers outside himself to wash out the stables of Augeas. After a series of burlesque attempts to overpower the shit that, despite his efforts, piles higher and higher, Hercules at last realizes that a single person cannot clean the stables in a day and decides to enlist natural forces to accomplish his task. Hercules succeeds in his task only by repressing the impulse to clean up the shit himself and learning to take action obliquely. Only by redirecting the river through the stables can he finally clean them out. He must learn the distinction that Novalis once posited between "direct" drive mechanisms, based on applying primary force, and the more elliptical, "indirect" causality of hydropower.18 But- and this is Müller's dia- lectical twist- in mastering the situation, Hercules makes himself superflu- ous. By using the river to do the work for him, he replaces his own hand with the water. "The river is my hand and my power," he states.19 Hercules' collabo- ration with the river is brought about by the hero's ability to assimilate forces and technologies outside his own body. The paleoanthropologist André Leroi- Gourhan called this capacity of the human to synthesize itself with alien forces "exteriorization."20 Yet the anthropotechnical strategy of exteriorization comes at a certain price, Leroi-Gourhan and Müller suggest. This dystopic aspect shows up in the later Hercules intermedium from Cement, where the hero is quite literally "exteriorized," where he is broken apart ("reduced again and again ... to his smallest components") and spatially assimilated by the machine that embraces him ("the machine which he was ceased to be"). As a conse- quence of this machinic embrace, that is, of increasing technical exterioriza- tion, the human's "natural" contours are lost. Bernard Stiegler, an important commentator on Leroi-Gourhan's work, notes a paradoxical feature of "the power of humanity": "The greater humanity's power, the more 'dehumanized' the world becomes."21 Technical progress and human "liberation" from nature 18. In a set of fragmentary notes on Galvinism and electricity, Novalis distinguished between "direct and indirect effects- for example, the effect of a built wheel on the gear rods is a direct effect; by contrast, the flow of steam and water when a built wheel is pressing against the valve is just an indirect effect." Indirect tools attenuate the mimetic basis of labor. For an engaging discussion of direct and indirect effects in Novalis, see Jocelyn Holland, "From Romantic Tools to Technics: Heideggerian Questions in Novalis's Anthropology," Configurations (forthcoming). 19.

Leroi-Gourhan recognized this paradox already in 1964, when he wrote that humanity "may very soon be confronted . . . with the problem ... of its rehumanization."22 That was also the year in which Müller published Herakles 5. As the first year of the NES, it was a pivotal year for labor politics in the GDR. The auton- omization of the economy under the NES bore a striking resemblance to the effect of Lenin's 1921 NEP, which had reestablished limited private owner- ship to invigorate a market crippled by the civil war. Like the NEP before it, the GDR's NES laid the foundation for a class of non-Party bureaucrats who, it was hoped, would bring about new levels of economic efficiency. With promises of a Wissenschaftlich-Technische Revolution (Scientific-Technical Revolution), this technical intelligentsia unleashed a second wave of Taylorist rationalization while curtailing Party control mechanisms in many economic sectors. In essence, the NES removed social and political criteria from man- agement of the national economy, subordinating the latter instead to cybernetic principles of self-regulation. At the second Bitterfelder conference of 1964, this paradigm of self-regulation was even imposed on GDR authors, who were repositioned within the NES as a cultural "subsystem" of the state's new cyber- netic order.23 The autonomization of the forces of production struck many East Ger- mans as a fetishization of technology and a concession to free-market capi- talism. Indeed, hard-liners could detect no difference between the concept of self-regulation and capitalism's "invisible hand." The new cybernetic principles "implied to many critics in the socialist world an abandonment of the Marx- ist vision of a practice based in the experience of class struggle in favor of a 'system-neutral,' 'value-free' technocratic reason."24 Among these critics was Müller, who regarded the implementation of NES principles as "the canoniza- tion of wretchedness, the birth of a caricature of 'real existing socialism.'" For Müller, such a system, which could operate only by violently expropriating labor power, openly contradicted the GDR's claim to be a state built on princi- ples of nonalienated labor. His decision to rewrite Cement in 1972, the year after the NES was abandoned, indicates Müller's awareness of the resonances between his own era and that of Lenin's NEP, which was the background 22.

As the maverick GDR scholar Fritz Mierau noted, the year 1973 "clearly reaches back everywhere into the Soviet year 1921."25 A line from the apparatchik Badjin in Müller's play summarizes NES strategy: "Since we can't eliminate capitalism, we'll exploit it" (Müller, Cement, 30). But to exploit capitalism, Müller reasoned, is to become capitalism. As Müller explained in a commentary on the play, Gleb's transformation from revolution- ary to a member of the technocratic managerial class was the basic design of Cemenfs narrative: "You can picture Chumalov here at the end in normal suit and tie. That's the development of the play, from the first scene where he comes in in his soldier's rags."26 Müller depicts the expropriation of labor power from the body as a form of extreme violence. While Gladkov's original text contained numerous scenes of the confiscation of material property, Müller's Cement, written in the wake of the Scientific-Technical Revolution, understands these processes of expro- priation more abstractly. The Bolsheviks in Müller's Cement commandeer not objects but labor power as such, life itself. And in this case, requisitioning life is just the opposite of taking life away: expropriating life in Müller's Cement means denying the subject a right to death. Instead of killing their enemies, good Bolsheviks capitalize on them. So, for example, the hour arrives when Gleb can finally avenge himself on the engineer Kleist, who during the civil war had ordered that Gleb be tortured to death, yet Chumalov decides at this moment not to kill the engineer but to incorporate him along with his intel- lectual capital (his expertise as a trained specialist) into the state apparatus. "You've been expropriated, Engineer," he states, "and now the Revolution owns your head." The play's final line, spoken by the apparatchik Chibis to a group of Cossacks and whites, reiterates this theme: "In the name of the work- ing people we call upon you to place your energies at the disposal of the Soviet Republic" (Müller, Cement, 64). In a commentary on this sentence, Müller explained that "the accent here is not on reconciliation with the enemies of socialism, but rather on the possible uses of their labor power for the prole- tarian state" {Cement, 67). Social struggle and violence persist, Müller would seem to suggest, even after the conclusion of the civil war, although the expro- priation of labor power in modern systems of production relocates the conflict to the economic sector. Here one sees the influence of Ernst Jünger, whose 25. Fritz Mierau, "Zement- fünfzig Jahre danach," in Fyodor Vasilievich Gladkov and Heiner Müller, Zement (Leipzig: Reclam, 1975), 515. 26.

Following Jünger, Müller argues that labor expropriation in regimes of industrial labor inaugu- rates what is in effect a perpetual state of civil war. While the Scientific-Technical Revolution's system of cybernetic regu- lation claimed to give birth to the so-called postindustrial economy of the information age, this technocratic pseudometaphysics, Müller shows, can never leave behind the human body entirely. But the NES irreversibly disfigures the human body. Because modern labor is fundamentally nonanthropomorphic, and thus by nature undramatic and unstageable, all of the attempts to depict the anthropic origins of labor generate for Müller only perverse and disturb- ing tableaux. In Cement's encounters between mythical heroes and methods of modern production, it never ends well for the hero. After the rationalized factory has extracted labor power from the worker's physical body, it leaves behind only the most creaturely of bodies as its by-product. In her 1958 book The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt gave a species name to the being made by systems of mechanical production: animal laboram, which she defined as a purely biological being, a creature stripped of all qualities save the very fact of its being alive.27 The modern laborer is defined not politically or socially but metabolically, as an organism. The working body is "bare life." In fact, Marx had already identified the particular mode of dehumanization at the core of modern labor when he repeatedly characterized the proletariat in Capital as vogelfrei, "free but outside of the human community and there- fore entirely unprotected and without legal rights."28 Vogelfrei, which etymo- logically means "free to be eaten by the birds, since the body of an outlaw could not be buried," perfectly describes the creaturely bodies in Müller's plays.29 Müller's stage refuses to inhume bare life. Instead, it leaves this bio- logical by-product to rot before the spectator's eyes. While the creaturely fig- ures and tableaux of Müller's plays are strongly influenced by the baroque 27.

Bare life appears particularly powerfully in the mechanomorphic imag- ery of Cement, where the symbiosis between the human and its technical prostheses literally exteriorizes the human, exploding the body nightmarishly into the surrounding space. Hercules, we saw, is assimilated by the Taylorist machine of the Hydra. Prometheus, too, merges into the setting as a miner- alized amalgam: "Time, weather and bird feces had made flesh indistin- guishable from metal, and both indistinguishable from the stone" (Müller, Cement, 26). The era that began with Gladkov's Cement, Müller wrote, "will come to an end with the unity of human and machine- the next step in evolu- tion."30 The body that merges with the machine in Müller's play looks quite different from the industrialized body in Gladkov's book, which culminates in a scene depicting the complete integration of the cement factory, the rhyth- mic mass of workers, and the mountainside itself into a single undulating body. The marriage of flesh and metal in Müller's play resembles not the indus- trial superman vaunted by Gladkov but the human ruins of Otto Dix's Card- playing War Cripples of 1920.31 Against the rationalist fantasy of perfectly efficient production, Müller calls attention to the abject surplus of the body, which piles up everywhere, from the decomposing animal manure in the defunct cement factory to the bird shit and vomit that fuse Prometheus's body to his fetters and the mountain.32 Reconstruction and rationalization cannot be accomplished vithout waste matter, whatever the technocrats may think. The Thebians m / ; akles 5 may expect to have their meat without manure, but excrement remains, as Augeas reminds Hercules, "the other condition of the flesh."33 There is no production without putrefaction, no industry without creatureliness. 30.

For Müller, it is Georg Büchner- "the poet of creatureliness" par excellence- who gave the most vivid rendering of vogelfreies life in the character of Woyzeck, a simian and subhuman "open wound" that will not heal: "Somewhere, his body perhaps swings itself forward on his hands, shaking with laughter perhaps, toward an unknown future that perhaps will be his crossbreeding with a machine, propelled against the force of gravity in the frenzy of rockets."

Cement is never able to resolve the tensions between factory work and everyday exis- tence completely. This lack of resolution, anomalous among early Soviet pro- duction novels, certainly explains the appeal of Gladkov's book to Müller. Already in "Love Story," a short narrative from the early 1950s, Müller strug- gled with the inscrutability of revolutionary affect in the era of reconstruc- tion.34 Gladkov's text depicts the reconstruction of the cement factory with great keenness, but the restructuring of intimacy and human relations remains an incomplete project. "Finally we shall have to have a revolution within our- selves as well," the Bolshevik Polia explains to Gleb, who remains troublingly beholden to prerevolutionary sexual mores. "Yes," she states, "there must be a ruthless civil war within ourselves" (Gladkov, Cement, 213). Gladkov showed that Bolshevism demanded more of the Soviet populace than just rebuilding factories and restoring the country's industrial capacity. Indeed, the greater challenge was how to reconceive human relations themselves in accordance with the new social ideals. Gladkov's book suggested that it is in fact simpler to implement revolutionary political slogans than to transform the stubborn habits of everyday existence. At the moment when "the revolution is entering into its second phase, into revolutionary everyday life," Anna Seghers wrote in a 1927 review of Cement, "the head is faster than the heart": "It was easier [for Gleb] to let himself be shot for the revolution than to recognize the revolution's conclu- sions at home, where, for example, the body of his wife is involved."35 Ulti- mately, Gladkov's book may not have been able to resolve the tension between industrial labor and the work of intimacy- which are gendered and coded allegorically in the figures of Gleb and Dasha- but it must be credited at least for recognizing that a work about production must also somehow address the conditions of human intersubjectivity, those superstructural elements shunted aside by the fanatics of heavy industry. In this regard, Müller's inclusion of Prometheus into Cement reveals a certain insight, since the myth of Prome- theus connects the origins of technology (the Titan steals the divine fire and gives craft to man) and of labor (man is condemned forever to toil for his liveli- hood) to the origins of intimate relations: as a result of Prometheus's theft, man 34.

Production, in other words, is inseparable from reproduction. Yet the concrete strategies for mediating between the productive and the reproduc- tive spheres are never specified in Gladkov's book. The question of how to connect the two remains just that: a question. A structural consequence of this irresolution is that the novel follows two narrative arcs simultaneously- Gleb rebuilds the factory while Dasha reconstructs everyday life- without these two agendas ever coinciding. "Somehow love will have to be arranged differently," a puzzled Dasha tells Gleb (Gladkov, Cement, 292), although the problems of how love should be configured after the revolution and how it is to be reconciled with new regimes of production are never settled. Brik noted in his review of the book that this disconnection mars the structure of the text itself: just as the creaturely and emotional aspects of human existence can- not be reconciled with factory labor, the Dasha plot and the Gleb plot cannot be reconciled narratologically. Because a form of social organization capable of integrating moments of affect and intimacy into the public sphere of pro- duction continues to elude the characters, the two distinct narrative threads of Cement must remain asymptotic, Brik notes. Gleb overcomes saboteurs, the whites, the malingerers, and material scarcity to rebuild the cement fac- tory, while Dasha overhauls the cultural institutions of quotidian life, creat- ing, for example, a cooperative kitchen and a center for collective child care (although it is in this same center that their daughter, Niurka, later dies, it seems, from lack of affection). The relationship between Gleb and Dasha deteriorates, and the family falls apart, but Gladkov offers no explanation for these failures. Human intimacy becomes only more enigmatic in the post- revolutionary period, as Walter Benjamin observed in a 1927 review of Glad- kov's novel: If the forces of command and domination really become feminine, this will bring about change in those forces, in the age, and even in the Feminine itself. Moreover, it does not mean a change into a vague humanity in gen- eral, but will present us with a new, more mysterious countenance, a politi- cal enigma if you like, a sphinx-like expression, compared to which all the old secrets of the boudoir are no more than outworn riddles.36 36.

"Dasha's face must look like the Sphinx," he urged.37 Having to this point focused exclusively on the depiction of mythological nar- ratives in Müller's plays, we have neglected his understanding of myth as itself a mode of labor with a concrete use value. Müller was interested not just in the contents of myth but in its form. Myth is a particular cultural technology and resource. Echoing Marx's definition of capital as "geronnene kollektive Arbeit" (coagulated collective labor), Müller proposed that myths be understood as "geronnene kollektive Erfahrungen" (coagulated collective experiences).38 Made out of the sedimented capital of human history, these precipitates of collective labor were for Müller invaluable resources, inventions, and devices that, despite their apparent obsolescence, can be actualized in the present day. Myth is an apparatus, he wrote, "an aggregate, a machine, onto which other new machines can always be coupled. Myth conveys energy until the grow- ing energy explodes the circuit of culture."39 As a cultural technology, myth is itself a productive force. Take Hesiod's didactic Works and Days, a compre- hensive user's manual for everything from crop rotations to moral conduct that suffuses its mythical narrative with the laborer's practical know-how. For this reason, Wilhelm Wundt considered mythical thinking a relay between empiri- cal sensation and abstract ideation. In his 1904 Völkerpsychologie (Social Psy- chology) he wrote that "Mythos ist in Vorstellung und Wandlung gewandelter Affekt" (myth is affect that has been converted into fantasy and morphosis).40 It is a transformer of thought. Myth contains not abstract axioms but diagrams for thinking and systems of relationality. This explains its particular robust- ness and durability. Although myth conveys no specific informational content, although it fails to mean anything, myth structures experience and bodies of cultural knowledge. It is paraconceptual rather than preconceptual. As Ver- nant explained, "The device of mythology has the role of a formal framework, an instrument of thought. . . . Through its syntactical and semantic organiza- tion the language employed by myth in itself represents a way of arranging 37. Müller, in conversation with Case and Fehervary, 77. 38.

Blumenberg's inquiry into the anthropological sources of mythical thinking builds on the work of the philosopher Arnold Gehlen, who defined the human organism as a Mängelwesen (deficient being) in need of intermediate elements that can distance it, at least partly, from the shocks of experience in the immediate present. Such, for Gehlen and Blumenberg, is the role of myth, which, like other symbolic cultural orders such as metaphor, pro- vides Entlastung (relief) for a being that would otherwise be paralyzed and crushed by the exigencies of reality {Weltzwang). By giving anthropomorphic form to the "chaos of the unnamed," by particularizing our existential dread, Blumenberg explains, myth ruptures the "absolutism of reality." Insofar as myth humanizes an inhuman world, it functions like other systems that organize and orient the existence of humans. Like technology, the cultural body of myth that humans inhabit is not, in other words, an anthropological given but an invention that they interpose between their organism and the outside world. "The organic system resulting from the mechanism of evolution becomes 'man' by evading the pressure of that mechanism by setting against it something like a phantom body. This is the sphere of his culture, his institutions- and also his myth."42 Myth, Blumenberg concludes, is both a symbolic form and a technology. Gehlen and Blumenberg argue that mythical thinking gives rise to a par- ticular experience of temporality- that mythical thinking is even at the origin of the experience of time as such. This is why Prometheus is one of the most robust and irrepressibly actual figures from the pantheon of ancient myth. The emblem of "fore-thought," Pro-metheus reveals that the human experience of temporality is inseparable from humanity's birth into technology. A human "is ultimately an anticipatory creature," Gehlen notes. "Like Prometheus, man is oriented toward what is removed, what is not present in time and space; in contrast to the animal, he lives for the future and not in the present."43 This 4L Jean-Pierre Vernant, "The Reason of Myth," in Myth and Society in Ancient Greece, trans.

As direct manual activity is detoured through each of these modes of cultural artifice, an interval opens between action and effect. And this "hiatus," as Gehlen called it, attenuates a human's ontological presence, scattering him or her over the axis of time. By creating a "second nature," that temporal interval that we call culture, humans acquire memory and historical senses, a past and a future. During our centrifugal evolution, which sees the center of human existence migrating increasingly outward, human conscious- ness is dispersed over time just as the human body is extended into space. We have circled back to Leroi-Gourhan's notion of exteriorization: "The tempo- rality of the human, which marks it off among other living beings, presumes exteriorization and prostheticity: there is time only because memory is 'artifi- cial,' becoming constituted as already-there since its 'having been placed out- side of the species.'"44 It is in Negt and Alexander Kluge's collaboration Geschichte und Eigensinn (History and Obstinacy) that we find the traditions of anthropol- ogy and historical materialism configured in the manner most resonant with Miiller's work. If Marx's Capital provided the foundational analysis of forces of production in all of their objectivated, material forms from factory machin- ery to communication technologies, Geschichte und Eigensinn examines the other, human half of this complex, as it were: the living forces of production, the anthropology of labor power, the biological foundations of political econ- omy. The capitalization of the body begins with primitive accumulation, the first spur of the division of labor. "In the same way that the commodity is the basic cell in the system of production and valorization, primitive accumula- tion is for Marx the secret history of the concretization of labor power in a given industrial society."45 The task of Negt and Kluge's book- the recovery of this "secret history"- aligns them closely with Miiller's project to stage the anthropomorphic sources of labor under the NES. As the foundational act of division and exteriorization, primitive accumulation makes possible the his- torical organization of human labor capacities, what Friedrich Engels famously 44.

W. F. Hegel explained, the epistemology of human consciousness (the distinction between subject and object). Division is the ontogenetic seat of human consciousness and abstract thinking, but it is also the source of a permanent condition of social alienation. Negt and Kluge point out that these are two aspects of a single process of psychological distancing that makes us alien both to others and to ourselves: The faculty of intelligence presupposes something seemingly simple: a capacity for sacrifice [Hingabefähigkeit]. To get something, I must give away something; to have something, I must leave something for the other [muß ich etwas im anderen belassen]: in other words, I must have developed the capac- ity not to possess something else in its entirety. To acquire this capacity, I must already know from my own experience that I can part with a piece of myself. (Geschichte, 450) Like production, thinking requires one to be able literally to sever and remove part of oneself. Intelligence is by nature oblique, as Hercules discovers in Her- akles 5 when he uses the river as an "indirect" tool to clean out the Augean stables. Humans learn to exteriorize their energies but thereby become, para- doxically, something less than human. "No [labor] process can succeed through a direct approach," Negt and Kluge write. "The process must outwit either nature or another member of society or an enemy, so that they yield their power against their will. The system of precise manipulations [Feingriffe] and trick- ery is the original seat of intelligence insofar as the latter emerged within the productive labor capacities" (Geschichte, 450). The division of labor introduces an interval not just between the pro- ducer and the object, then, but also between the producer and himself or her- self and thereby inaugurates a permanent transformation in the affective econ- omy of the human organism. Although this gap increases as industrialization compounds the processes of division to ever higher orders, the purpose of pro- gressive political projects of course cannot be the abrogation of the division of labor and a return to the primitive mode of existence that preceded the intro- duction of the interval between the laborer and his or her object. Rather, the 46.

How can these remote objects once again be made perceptible? How can the things separated from us by the division of labor be resocialized, made once again into our intimates? How would it be possible to recover, we could ask with Müller, the anthropic source of abstract labor? "While our senses for what is close to us [Nähesinnen] work well," Negt and Kluge observe, "we have not yet cultivated senses for what is distant [Fernsinnen]. Above all, the latter senses do not con- stitute a society. This is the political problem of the present and a distortion of the basic relationship to history" (Geschichte, 597). If the act of production requires externalizing and parting with a piece of oneself and thus presup- poses, as Negt and Kluge suggest, a capacity for sacrifice, then a crucial politi- cal task is learning to recognize those products of labor as objectivated pieces of man, as part objects that the subject has entrusted to others. To span the dis- tances that have developed out of the division of labor, these detached relations must once again be rendered sensuous by cultivating Fernsinnen. Müller's own project reminds us, moreover, that this distance is not just spatial but also essentially temporal. Hence his interest in myth as a device to cultivate specifically historical Fernsinnen. Humans, Gehlen reminds us, are "oriented toward what is removed, what is not present in time and space." Yet our society seems to have tended to only the first half of this equation, to time. From the "spatialization" of thought in so-called postmodernity to the contemporary urban experience of topographical compression, today there is everywhere evidence that our society and its media have conquered spatial extension. The current age has developed a superabundance of spatial Fern- sinnen in the form of telecommunication technologies. But the powers of the temporal imagination have atrophied with this shift toward the spatial. Symp- tomatic of this shift is the loss of the Utopian imaginary, the loss of the very possibility of a place that exists outside our own time. Although we live in a condition of "existential uneven development," as Fredric Jameson puts it, we lack an ability to differentiate and navigate the multiple, overlapping time frames that we inhabit. Jameson describes this condition as "the end of temporality."47 Myth was, for Müller, a principal instrument for developing the missing capacity for temporal distinction. The "coagulated collective experiences" of myth make it possible to inflect and articulate time. Against the now-prevalent 47.

All of the things that have ceased to exist here- the iron curtain, and the things that stand for it, the Wall- could of course now be considered instru- ments for slowing down a historical process. Stalin was the last one to apply the brakes, and Hitler was the great accelerator. . . . There is this customary idea that the revolution is a moment of acceleration. Perhaps that's not at all right. Perhaps it is always a matter of arresting time, of slowing time down The Commune was ... a matter of slowing down For example, shooting at clocks, arresting time. And arresting time of course also means gaining time, it means stopping the decline and keeping the end open, it means stalling.48 Reaching across historical cycles that are much longer than an individual's life span, Müller uses myth to excavate the collectivities that lie dormant deep within cultural memory. "Labor capacities that have split off can . . . become active again even after two or three hundred years," Kluge suggests.49 Myth, which occupies a register of slow, geologic time outside history, becomes for Müller a device for recovering these forgotten anthropological capacities. Müller's interest in time's plasticity is perhaps most manifest in his preoccupation with the dead.50 The insistent presence of the dead in his plays establishes the possibility of a dialogue with those who have come before and thus enables a productive relationship to history. In mythical-production plays such as Cement, this solidarity with bygone generations is part of the project to rehumanize capital, whether in its material forms, such as factory machin- ery and technology, or in its cultural forms, such as myth and art. On the open- ing pages of his Eighteenth Brumaire, where he discusses the "process of world-historical necromancy," Marx famously noted that "men make their own history, but not out of loose pieces and not under circumstances they 48.

The tradition of all dead generations weighs heavily [wie ein Alp' on the minds of the living."51 Nowhere does the tradition of dead generations weigh as heavily on the minds of the living as on Müller's stage. The defunct factory in Cement- which Gladkov had already described as being "like a dead planet" {Cement, 14)- is not just inorganic matter; it is also the mineralized remains of those who came before. The factory is itself the material precipitate of human relations and a blueprint for society, which is why Marx once described the industrial factory as "das aufgeschlagene Buch der menschlichen Wesenskräfte" (an open book of the essential powers of man) and as "die sinnlich vorliegende menschlische Psychologie" (human psychology given sensuous form).52 The locus of Cement is for Müller simul- taneously a factory and a crypt, both a means of production and a site where labor power is entombed. Just as there is no strict division between living and dead labor, which are brought into a metabolic exchange by processes of pro- duction, it is impossible to distinguish categorically between the biological and the mechanical. "The cement of tomorrow is made of today's dead," the engineer Kleist states in Müller's play. "Bones and lime Chumalov. / Soviet power. Our factory. Revolution" {Cement, 402; 24). As Haiina Stephan points out in a text comparing Gladkov's and Müller's versions of Cement, Müller focuses far more on the factory itself than Gladkov does;53 indeed, Gleb's interactions with the factory have an even greater role in Müller's play than his relationship with Dasha. For Müller, Gleb's relations with the dead and the factory are more important than his relations with the living. If industrial capi- tal is the tomb of living labor power, then rehumanizing capital- liquefying and liberating the "coagulated collective labor" that it contains- requires rais- ing the dead, "the cement factory is a grave," says Gleb. "This is the resurrection" (Müller, Cement, 51). The Bolsheviks, it must be noted, never excelled at such necromancy. Just one year after the Russian revolution Bakhtin already expressed dismay 51.

The Bolsheviks, who took a liquidationist attitude toward the past, perpetuated this prejudice for the present and the future by privileging the living over the dead. The dangers that arise by favoring the living over the dead were a great concern of the cosmist philosopher Nikolai Fedorov, who demanded in Filosofila obshchego dela {Philosophy of the Common Task) that socialism stop discriminating against the dead, that it stop prioritizing the cur- rent generation's perspective and agendas. This, Fedorov argued, can only lead to an extremely shortsighted form of socialism. He reasoned that the only egal- itarian society would be one in which the dead could participate equally in the state. He concluded that true socialism would require resurrecting the departed laborers from whom the present generation continues to profit.55 Socialism, in other words, must stop exploiting the dead and establish an egalitarian society that reaches across time, a society concerned with the welfare of both the pres- ent generation and of generations past. For similar reasons Müller considered the dead a decisive constituency in the communist system, although his understanding of communist necro- mancy was far more materialist, far less theological than Fedorov's. "We com- munists / will also have to liberate our dead," Gleb states laconically (Müller, Cement, 41). Socialism requires attending to the dead who constantly shadow the characters of Cement as the "phantom body" of technology. Müller thus gives the last scene of Cement the apt title "The Liberation of the Dead." So important was this concept for Müller that he repeated it two years later in the stage directions for the production play Traktor, this time with reference to the techniques of the Soviet documentary filmmaker Dziga Vertov: "The libera- tion of the dead takes place in slow motion?'56 It isn't necessary to invoke the positions of Bakhtin, Fedorov, and Vertov, however, to understand the centrality for Müller of capital's anastasis.

Bertolt Brecht concluded his 1934 Threepenny Novel with a similar vision of the Judgment Day. Like Miiller's couplings of ancient myth and industrial production, The Threepenny Novel was concerned with how to represent figurally and concretely non- anthropomorphic systems of modern labor. As Brecht's collaborator, Elisabeth Hauptmann, explained in 1930, Brecht felt that "the (great) form of the drama has until now not been suitable for representing either modern processes [such as the mechanisms of a large corporation], or the lives of people who rule our age, or even story lines with episodes. Such things, he said, are not dramatic in our sense."57 The Threepenny Novel, Brecht's project to narrativize the abstract mechanisms of capital by giving them sensuous artistic form, was closely related to Sergei Eisenstein's ambitious, but unrealized, proposal to create a film of Marx's theoretical opus, Capital. One of the great achievements of Brecht's novel is that it motivates the mechanisms of capital over four hundred pages without a single actant. There are characters, of course, but ultimately they are not actors in the story. In modern society, agency is dispersed among numerous actants across time. It is the system that acts, as in an Emile Zola novel. Brecht's detective novel frames this modern condition as an essentially forensic problem: murders and thefts take place in the book, but the responsi- ble parties cannot be identified. Each illicit deed is, to quote Siegfried Kra- cauer, a "Tat ohne Täter" (act without an actor), a crime without a criminal.58 At the end of the novel Brecht asks how it would be possible to pay off all of capital's debts, as it were, to track down all of the human agents "behind" every commodity. This, again, is a forensic question. Brecht answers it with an apocalyptic Judgment Day, the "greatest arraignment of all time."59 To tell the story of a great commercial enterprise such as MacHeath's empire of B. shops, Brecht suggests that it would be necessary to reconstruct exhaustively the labors of all generations past and present. And so the dead are subpoenaed at the end of The Threepenny Novel. "Everyone who had ever set foot on this earth was allowed to voice his plaints."60 Presiding from a place outside his- torical time (the location of this trial is a Utopian construction par excellence), the judge begins to interview everyone from the owner of one of the failed 57.

As the inquiry proceeds, however, it becomes clear to the judge that he could never fulfill completely the living generation's obligation to the dead. With the elaboration of the division of labor, it has become virtually impossi- ble to reconstruct the "origin" of the modern commodity. In The Threepenny Novel the judge's confusion mounts until he begins to rave at the dead: There is the wall of the house- where is the bricklayer? Is he ever really paid in full? And this paper! Someone had to make it! Was he sufficiently compensated for it? And this table here! Is there really nothing owed to the man who planed the wood for it? The washing on the line! The line itself! And even the tree, which didn't plant itself here. This knife here! Is every- thing paid for? Fully? Of course not!61 As Brecht shows, it is impossible to arrive at that elusive desideratum of the physiocrats, a foundational or natural "origin" of value. The working body, that anthropomorphism that propels the mechanisms of capital, is nowhere to be found. Behind each instantiation of dead labor is yet more dead labor. And the debt to the dead can never be fully repaid, as Müller insisted in a set of interviews that was titled, with a nod to both Shakespeare and Freud, Ich schulde der Welt einen Toten (/ Owe the World a Dead Man).62 Brecht's works, Louis Althusser once remarked, are riven by the insu- perable division between quotidian chronological time and fulfilled suprahis- torical time, two "forms of temporality that do not achieve any mutual integra- tion, which have no relation to one another, which coexist and interconnect, but never meet each other, so to speak."63 Althusser's analysis of the conflicted temporal structure of Brecht's works, a central feature of the Brechtian legacy inherited by Müller, explains the latter's unconventional and notably morbid version of utopianism. Like the synoptic view of human history that concludes Brecht's Threepenny Novel, Müller's own liberation of the dead, a Marxist ver- sion of Judgment Day, takes place in a utopia outside sequential historical time. As Frank Kermode points out, there is a close connection between utopia and 61. Ibid., 391. 62.

This noplace hovers in a state of Kairos, Kermode observes, "an instance of what [psychologists] call 'temporal integration'- our way of bundling together perception of the present, memory of the past and expectation of the future, in a common organization. Within this organization that which was conceived of as simply successive becomes charged with past and future: what was chronos becomes kairos." Kermode further notes that even secularized societies "still need the fullness of [time], the pleroma; and it is our insatiable interest in the future (towards which we are biologically orien- tated) that makes it necessary for us to relate to the past."64 It is not surprising, then, that Gladkov's Cement had a particular appeal to Müller, since the tempo- ral structure of Gladkov's novel openly exhibited this tension between chronos and kairos. This, as we saw, was the point that Brik made in his 1926 review of Cement, where he argued that the book oscillates irresolutely between the quotidian registers of everyday life and the mythical time of legend.65 Miiller's interlacing of chronos and kairos, of history and utopia, returns us to the phenomenon that began our inquiry, namely, what Huyssen called "utopia in reverse," the mode of the Utopian imaginary sustained by the tension between "history and fiction, history and representation, history and myth." Yet Miiller's version of utopia seems darker and more apocalyptic than con- ventional utopias. When Müller reanimated myth in the 1960s, these prehis- torical archaicisms indicted the NES's ideology of progress by giving a voice to past generations, to the dead whose share in the present was repressed and obscured by the futurist orientation of the Party's economic policies. Stripped of its optimistic character, utopia functioned for Müller as a tactical position from which to denounce a Party policy that was ultimately indistinguishable from a capitalist economic system. His version of utopia, in other words, was critical and strategic rather than sentimental. The utopia of myth becomes important again after the fall of the Wall, . when, as Müller noted in 1991, capitalism "no longer has any alternative or any enemy outside of itself."66 When our sense of the future has passed away 64.

Katerina Clark offers a related analysis of the socialist-realist novel, which is marked by a '"fatal split' in terms of mode: the novel depicts 'what is' (i.e., it uses the realist mode) / the novel depicts 'what ought to be' (i.e., it idealizes reality, the Utopian or mythic mode)." This "proclivity for making sudden, unmotivated transitions from realistic discourse to the mythic or the Utopian" Clark designates as the "modal schizophrenia" of socialist realism {The Soviet Novel: History as Ritual [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000], 37). 66.

The "blind spots on the maps of the past," he reminds us, are "often invested with Utopian energies very much oriented toward the future." Kermode wrote sim- ilarly of the apocalyptic impulse, noting that "it is our insatiable interest in the future (towards which we are biologically orientated) that makes it necessary for us to relate to the past." Given the vital connection for Müller between the dead and the future, and given our own precarious position between a bygone utopia and an apocalypse to come, Miiller's necromancy cannot be dismissed as simple morbidity. The future is built out of bones and lime. "Again and again we have to exhume the dead," Müller explained the year after the Wall fell, "for our future can only come out of them. Necrophilia is a love for the future. We have to accept the presence of the dead as partners or obstacles in dialogue. The future can only come into being through dialogue with the dead."67 67.
