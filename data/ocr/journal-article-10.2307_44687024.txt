Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Collision performance of automotive seat systems has been a subject of inquiry since crash research was in its infancy. However, when federal standards were initiated in 1968 regarding seat system performance, they became the baseline for automotive design, and later became the topic of numerous debates in terms of occu- pant crash force and energy management. This subject of energy management as it relates to seat design has been extended and expanded in the current time period. This paper will discuss current design trends in automo- tive seat design collision performance in terms of new data recently becoming available. Also, due to recent proposals and discussion regarding modification of FMVSS 207, a review of seatback performance data in a dynamic environment will be presented. Any proposals regarding the modification of FMVSS 207 require careful evaluation and quantification of seat system goals. Iden- tification and establishment of beneficial characteristics of seat structures and how these characteristics can be evaluated in both static and dynamic environments is cru- cial before any discussion of seat system performance goals can be established. Since approximately 1993, the Federal Government has conducted a substantial number of rear-end crash tests that provide new data that can be utilized to evaluate and better understand the static and dynamic performance of automotive seat systems. Procedures for evaluation and analysis of this data will be discussed, along with a review of current energy management capabilities of seat systems. Recent research on the energy analysis of rear impact collision exposures will also be included and dis- cussed. INTRODUCTION Research on the collision performance of seat systems has spanned nearly five decades and has analyzed vari- ous aspects of the crash environment as it relates to occupant-seat interaction. The federal government began addressing the issue in the mid-1 960's. FMVSS 207, which specified a minimum seat strength and perfor- mance requirement, was introduced along with dozens of other standards relating to various safety aspects of auto- motive design. The initial seat standard followed a GSA requirement for seats in vehicles sold to the government and was based on Society of Automotive Engineers rec- ommended practice J879. Although research on various aspects of seat design had been conducted since the mid-1 950's [1]*, the require- ments of FMVSS 207 and FMVSS 202 introduced a num- ber of changes into seat designs, including improved head support and increased strength requirements for seats. This government interest, as well as an increase in awareness of the extent to which motorists were incur- ring injuries in rear-end collisions, generated additional interest in the occupant kinematics or motions of the occupant in the seat system during these types of crashes. Full scale crash testing conducted in the 1960's [2,3,4] evaluated a number of seat-related issues, includ- ing an evaluation of various seat design concepts. This early research identified the head motions that applied forces to the neck and caused hyperextension or "whip- lash." The evaluation of dummy motion under various crash conditions with various seat restraint systems gave researchers the foundation necessary to better under- stand occupant protection requirements for rear-end colli- sion exposures. Some recommendations from these earlier studies however, proved to be impractical and introduced potential new problems that many felt could increase, rather than reduce, the potential for serious injury during certain crash exposures. Early crash test research evaluated a wide range of severity levels for various seatback heights and strengths, as well as the effect of various occupant anthropometry and positions within the occupant com- partment. One observation from this work indicated that an occupant who is effectively "tied" to the automotive structure by an integrated belt system that was attached to a rigid seat structure could ride out a collision, depend- ing almost entirely on the vehicle structure for energy management [5]. Unfortunately, if the occupant was sep- arated or offset in some manner from this rigid seat sys- tem, the absence of a yielding seatback that could moderate the crash forces, substantially increased * Numbers in brackets designate references at end of paper 1891</page><page sequence="2">acceleration levels and resulting injury potential [6]. The- v ooservations reinforced the conclusion that yield- ing seatback structures were required to protect occu- pants over a wide range of collision exposures. STATISTICS Since 1968 there has been an enormous amount of data collected that can assist in analyzing the rear-end colli- sion with respect to its associated injury exposure. Avail- able statistical data is segmented into various categories including overall frequency, severity levels, serious inju- ries (AIS 3+), and HARM. REAR IMPACT FREQUENCY -As a category of colli- sion type, the rear-end impact is the most common type of collision. Although it accounts for nearly a third of all collisions, it accounts for only 3 to 5 percent of all serious or fatal injuries. Figure 1 depicts the overall frequency of rear-end collision exposure to risk of AIS 3+ injuries [7,8]. The data depicted is from NASS files, which represents collisions where at least one vehicle is towed away. It is observed in this data, that almost 70 percent of all rear- end collisions have occurred before serious injury risk becomes an issue. Further analysis of these same data indicates that 85 percent of the rear end collision expo- sures are at a delta-V or crash severity of approximately 32 kph (20 mph) or less. Again, it is noted that this data is taken from collisions where the severity level was suffi- ciently high to have had at least one vehicle towed away from the accident scene. Because of that omission, the frequency data is biased toward higher severity levels than would be the case if the large number of non-tow- away rear-end collisions were included in this data. This high number of low-speed collisions results in a large number of lower severity injuries (AIS-1). 70 -ļ FREQUENCY^^^ 60 NASS DATA 77-79 ~ / / ' ^ ' NASS DATA 80-94 g 50 ■ ] / ^ X ' (rollovers excluded) - I / AIS 3+ RISK Î 30 - / / A / Î § - ' / / / ' ' //• /s / / ' //• £ 20 - / // 0 -I 1 1 I i 'i' 1 ^ -*■ I - - " 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Crash Severity (mph) Figure 1 . Crash Severity vs Frequency / Risk Published research by Malliaris and others [9,10,11] pre- sented the technique of HARM to evaluate injury expo- sures in various impact modes. This method employed the frequency and societal cost factors associated with injuries as a function of various severity levels. Part of the research included an evaluation of the rear impact mode and its associated HARM. It was observed that an overwhelming majority of the injuries was occurring from "non-contact" and from frontal structures. As seen in Fig- ure 2, the "non-contact" HARM was seen to be dominat- ing the influence of injury exposure. This finding is important due to the lower severity implication of the "non-contact" and 'Iront" structures. Meaning if one assumes these exposures are due to "whiplash" and rebound effects, then the stiffness of the seat plays a sig- nificant role in those injury exposures. Other researchers have also reported this observation [10,12]. Figure 2. Distribution of HARM (NASS 1976-86) to Front Seat Unrestrained Occupants by Source of Most Severe Injury (Single Rear- Impact Event) Low Severity Injuries in Crashes - Stifter or "rigidified" seats have been shown by a number of research studies to have a greater potential for "whiplash" associated inju- ries in rear-end collisions [7,13,14,15]. While the exact mechanisms concerning these injuries are still somewhat unclear, studies back in 1967, as well as today, have shown that the general kinematics and injury potential associated with the "whiplash" phenomenon appear more frequently in stiffer and stronger seat designs ver- sus the more yielding seat designs. This tendency for increased neck injury becomes an important consider- ation when one evaluates the effect of strengthening cur- rent seat designs. If the force levels required to plastically deform a seat are increased, then the forces currently responsible for many of the lower severity injury and HARM are increased as well. This could have sub- stantial implications on the frequent, lower severity colli- sions where current seat designs are performing reasonably well. 1892</page><page sequence="3">FEDERAL STANDARDS There are three Federal Standards directly addressing rear impact collision performance. These are Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 207 (FMVSS 207), which generally addresses seat performance, FMVSS 202 that deals with head restraints and FMVSS 301 , which generally addresses fuel system performance but provides a body of data that is useful in seat collision performance analysis. FMVSS 207 - FMVSS 207 was initiated in 1968 to require automotive seats to withstand certain forces related to the rear-impact collision environment [16]. The recommended practice and federal standard generally specifies the following: 1. Seat anchorages and seatbacks must be able to withstand 20 times their weight in the forward and rearward directions. 2. The seatback must be able to withstand a moment about a seating reference point of 373 newton- meters (3300 inch-pounds) in a rearward direction. 3. If belt restraints are directly attached to the seat, the seat system must also be able to meet belt attach- ment requirements. The prescribed method of compliance testing generally requires attachment of a force application device to an upper cross-member of the seat frame structure. The procedure dictates that the force required to deform the seat rearward then be utilized to compute the moment about the H-Point described in the standard. Other research has evaluated various methods of pro- ducing more realistic seat testing procedures. In 1967, Severy [2] described a testing method that has been uti- lized over the years, and in 1987, Strother [9] described a slightly modified version of this test. These testing proce- dures evaluate the seat in a fully trimmed condition, and apply the load near the center of gravity of the occupant torso in a manner that more closely simulates crash con- ditions. Additionally, by utilizing a "body block", represen- tative of an occupant torso, this evaluation technique provides some basis for evaluating seat trim resistance and pocketing effects. Currently, there are ongoing inquiries and research to revisit Federal standards and the applicable Society of Automotive Engineers' recommended practices regard- ing seat crash performance to determine if updates are appropriate. Most seats currently exceed the existing standards by large margins [17,18]. Recent proposals and discussions have centered on the development of a static or dynamic testing procedure to potentially require a certain minimum level of energy absorption by the seat. Other suggestions have been made to limit rearward motion. A later section will discuss occupant energy dis- sipation by seating systems during automotive crashes. Also, the potential effect of limiting rearward motion is addressed by evaluating dummy occupant performance during rear-end crash tests. FMVSS 202 - FMVSS 202 is the federal standard that specifies requirements for head restraints to reduce the frequency and severity of neck injury in various collisions [19]. This standard essentially addresses low to moder- ate severity rear-end collision exposures. The federal standard specifies that for individual seat systems the headrest portion (in a fully extended condition) be no less than 271/2 inches from the seating reference point and 6% inches wide. Additionally, under prescribed conditions of backrest deflection, the headrest must be able to with- stand a 200 pound force over no more than 4 inches of headform deflection. This standard has general seat geometric and static load performance requirements. With all of the new data becoming available with respect to "whiplash" kinematics and the general focus on addressing lower severity inju- ries, the standard is currently under review for revision purposes. Part of the review and consideration is to make it more compatible with FMVSS 207, such that one performance standard would not reduce the benefits of the other one. In light of substantial amounts of new bio- mechanical data on lower speed head and neck kinemat- ics, this effort is proving to be an extremely difficult task. FMVSS 301 - FMVSS 301 is the safety standard related to the general performance of the vehicle fuel systems [20]. It was developed on the premise of limiting fuel spillage during and following a crash. The federal stan- dard generally specifies several tests including a rear moving barrier crash at 48 kph (-30 mph). These tests, especially as currently structured, provide substantial seat performance data. Seat and Occupant Performance - In the rear moving barrier crash, the vehicle is impacted by a 4000 pound rigid barrier moving at approximately 48 kph (-30 mph). Normally, the struck vehicle undergoes a 24 to 32 kph (15 - 20 mph) delta-V (AV). Over the years, some of the tests have utilized instrumented dummies. First, Hybrid II anthropometric test devices (ATDs) were utilized and then Hybrid III ATDs became the standard. When instru- mentation has been present, it generally has shown accelerations and neck motions that did not produce inju- rious values. In many of these tests, the severity level imparted on the vehicle and occupant typically is high enough to fully flex the seat system. This occurrence has been termed by some as "seat back collapse" and has been considered to be a seat failure, doing nothing towards absorbing the energy of the occupant. Contrary to these opinions, data from the rear moving barrier crash tests shows that actual energy absorption by the combi- nation of vehicle structural crush and seat deformation has served to absorb occupant energy and to limit colli- sion forces that otherwise would be transferred directly to the occupant. 1893</page><page sequence="4">GOVERNMENT RESEARCH REGARDING SEAT CRASH PERFORMANCE - The federal government (NHTSA) has revisited the issue of "seat back failure" on various occasions. In the mid 1970s, the issues relating to seat yield as a function of injury potential were visited. After considerable discussion and analysis, it was deter- mined that seats as currently designed were targeting the severity levels that had the greatest potential for injury, and therefore had good strength characteristics for miti- gating those injuries. In 1989 and continuing to the present time, NHTSA has been evaluating seat crash performance. In 1992 they issued a statement reaffirm- ing the advantages of yielding seat designs. They also recommended additional research to further evaluate the question of potential improvements in seat design to additionally reduce injury exposures [21]. Notwithstanding the good crash performance of seats in most collision exposures, a number of seat designs are showing a trend toward incorporation of restraint systems and additional inflatable restraints for side protection. Other designs attempt to better control occupant motion with the intended purpose of reducing neck hyperexten- sion. Most of these new features require additional and more complex structures built into seating systems; some of these additions result in seat designs becoming stiffer and more bulky. As a result of these changes, the rear energy management capabilities and associated prob- lems are changing and becoming more complex. Modified FMVSS 301 - Since about 1993, NHTSA has modified the test procedure of the rear moving barrier crash test to obtain further information regarding occu- pant-seat forces and motion. This new procedure essentially requires instrumentation of the driver Hybrid III, the seat and the seatbelt in order to gather information regarding performance of the seating system (see Appendix 1). A small number of these tests have been evaluated by the authors to provide a better understanding of the occu- pant kinematics and associated timing. Additional analy- sis of a greater number of tests will be required to more completely develop the trends and determine more detailed relationships. However, the evaluation of the data thus far generally supports the older research as it relates to injury exposure. The injury levels as predicted by the ATD instrumentation and associated calculations of injury criteria generally show values well within human tolerance limits. Although this finding is not new, it is felt that with the acceleration and seat rotation data now being obtained, it will be possible to better evaluate the force and energy levels as a function of seatback rotation and deformation during the collision. Generally, the seat structure absorbs energy and resists dummy inertial force through a substantial portion of the rotation. Some testing shows that this phenomenon is evident through a backrest rotation in excess of 60 degrees as measured from vertical [22], Earlier research has reported seat effectiveness through only 45-50 degrees in terms of retention abilities in a rear impact mode [5]. Figure 3. Graph of Seatback Angle and Crash Accelerations as a Function of Time Figure 3 depicts selected data obtained from an instru- mented FMVSS 301 rear crash test and plotted on the same graph to show various relationships. One is able see the relationship of the dummy acceleration levels to the seat rotation and vehicle velocity data. This data shows that the seat resists force over a longer time period than the vehicle crash pulse, thereby absorbing a significant amount of energy. The concept of how this energy absorption occurs has been over-simplified in pre- vious research [23]. Static Seat Testing - In November 1998, Molino of NHTSA [24] published a report concerning a project that included testing of current production automotive seats. In this project, 48 seats representing 25 different configu- rations were tested. The average seatback moment was approximately 1273 newton-meters (11,266 inch- pounds). A typical test example is depicted in Figure 4. Both the driver and passenger seats were tested and are represented on the same graph. One of the two seats was deformed through its ultimate strength and beyond, usually to an angle of 60 to 70 degrees with respect to vertical, if the seat structure permitted. The sister seat was then tested through 75 percent of the rotation of the first seat, and was then unloaded to determine its restitu- tion properties. It is important to note that the restitution of the seat depends on its relationship to the ultimate strength and not necessarily on its complete rotation [25]. A graph depicting Molino's restitution analysis is shown in Figure 5. This information was determined through rota- tion-dependant data as opposed to more appropriate strength-based data. Furthermore, the restitution char- acteristics of a given seat will change depending on the applied load. 1894</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4. Static Seat Test Data Shows Elastic Properties of Seat Figure 5. Molino Restitution Data In the report, Molino defines the yield strength as being the force at which the seat structure has moved into the plastic regime, causing the seat-loading curve to shift by approximately 5 percent away from the elastic slope. As seen in the load-deflection curve of Figure 4, loading curves typically have a linear portion in the first part of the curve that is typical of the elastic range of a material. It then translates into the non-linear range of its force- deflection curve. It was reported that on average, the yield strength of the seats tested was in the range of approximately 60 percent of the ultimate load. This find- ing is an important factor when considering the crash severity level at which seats will elastically spring back to their upright and undeformed position. Since the forces applied to an occupant will increase as the severity level of a crash increases, if the seat does not reach perma- nent yield at an appropriate severity level, potentially more severe injuries due to rebound effects could occur. Considering the elastic range of recent seat designs and if the trend increases toward stiffer seats, there is a valid concern regarding injuries increasing in frequency and in severity level (i.e. AIS 1 increased to AIS 2, etc.). EVALUATION OF ENERGY CHARACTERISTICS IN SEATING SYSTEMS The evaluation of energy management in seating sys- tems requires the identification and evaluation of multiple characteristics. These items not only include the static moment strength, but also the dynamic moment capabili- ties of the seat system, seatback restitution, seatback stiffness and overall energy capacity. Relationships between static and dynamic characteristics have to be identified before any evaluation can be completed. Direct application of static seating performance as a predictor of dynamic seat performance cannot be completed without careful analysis and verification of applied assumptions. Static seat testing can be performed to determine the ulti- mate moment capabilities of a seat. General practice has been the application of a horizontal load located at the upper cross member, or using a body block that applies a horizontal load approximately 9"-1 4" above the H-point. This moment arm is typically 10"-17" above seat pivot points. This type of evaluation also allows the mea- surement of the stored and returned energy. The ratio of stored energy to energy returned is an important charac- teristic in the evaluation of seat performance. This char- acteristic cannot be determined for the entire deformation range of the seat through a single static seat test since it has been found that restored energy is a function of the applied moment. In order to adequately determine these characteristics, the seatback must be loaded and unloaded from various applied forces, measuring the hys- teresis at each level. 50- # ' ***.

Lundell Restitution Data Research (WHIPS) completed by Lundell in 1998 [25], wherein a typical production seat was statically tested through a series of increasing moment applications mea- suring the hysteresis at each level, demonstrated the relationship between the applied load and restitution. As illustrated in Figure 6, restitution is a function of the load applied, peaking at lower loads while dropping off linearly as seat back angle increases. Excessive elastic restitu- tion is an undesirable characteristic that has to be identi- fied and attenuated, if possible. Evaluation of the energy capacity of a seat through static seat tests requires the evaluation of certain variables and clear identification of important cause and effect relationships between static and dynamic loads. 1895</page><page sequence="6">The assumption of a single moment arm representing occupant loading has to be examined and re-evaluated. A general assumption made in the past has been to apply 60 to 70 percent of the occupant weight with a moment arm of approximately 1 0"-1 4". Figure 7 illus- trates the moment arms about the H-point of a Hybrid III at three center of gravity (CG) locations; the head, the chest and the pelvis (lower torso). For this analysis it will be assumed that the lower legs and feet contribute little to the effective moment applied to the seatback. Figure 7 - Diagram of Hybrid III CG Reference Points from H-Point The weights at each CG location used in this evaluation of the dynamic applied moment are 11 pounds, 56.2 pounds, and 76.3 pounds for the head, chest and pelvis, respectively. It is important to note that while the total weight equals 143.5 pounds, it cannot be assumed that each CG inertial force is applied during the same time interval. Utilizing dynamic rear moving barrier crash tests, and specifically the acceleration data at each loca- tion, actual moments can be calculated as a function of time. The weight of the seatback was neglected in these calculations. The energy capacity of a seat derived from static seat tests has to be carefully evaluated and analyzed. The relationship between the dissipation of the kinetic energy of an occupant and the static energy capacity of a seat has been addressed incorrectly in past research [23]. The assumption that the kinetic energy of an occupant is solely dissipated into the seat structure, as postulated by some researchers, proves to be an incomplete assump- tion. Figure 8. Example of Model Representing Fixed Rear Barrier Impact As an example, in Figure 8 a vehicle is shown traveling rearward into a fixed barrier. The vehicle, seat and occu- pant can be represented by a spring-mass system within a spring-mass system (diagramed above the vehicle in Figure 8). The vehicle and the occupant are traveling with a velocity V. The kinetic energy of the system can be found to be as follows: KE*. = '/2lmv! =1/2 (M,„, -Vj + -V.,»2) As can be seen in Figure 8, the occupant's deceleration contributes to the force acting on the rear structure (Kveh) and therefore the work done. If the seat design within the vehicle is perfectly rigid, the kinetic energy of the occu- pant is transferred through the rigid seat system and con- sequently is absorbed by the rear structure of the vehicle. However, if the seat system absorbs energy by some form of yielding and deformation, then there is energy dissipated by the seat that does not go into the rear struc- ture energy absorption. This concept is modeled in the equation below and seen in the barrier test example (Fig- ure 3), where the seat system continues absorbing energy well after the crash pulse has ended. Eveh =1/2 KvehX2 =1/2(M,„ -VJ+Ã-(Mocc -Vj)) Where: Eveh = Energy absorbed by the vehicle structure X - Percent of occupant kinetic energy absorbed by the vehicle structure (rigid seat: X =1) 1896</page><page sequence="7">Hence, the energy absorbed by the seat can be described by the following: E «a, =l/ÌMocc -vjļii -a)=m„ e Where: E ¡¡em = Energy absorbed by the seat system M 0 = Moment about seat pivot point 0 = Angular displacement of seatback Because of this relationship between occupant, seat and vehicle, the energy capacity of a seating system cannot be completely evaluated without looking at the collision environment. The postulation that the energy absorbed in a static test can be used directly to determine maxi- mum delta-V, or threshold velocity where occupant reten- tion is lost, does not take into account the vehicle factors for evaluation of energy management as shown by the mathematical model. ENERGY MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS Although crash analysis research [26] as well as existing statistics point to the effectiveness of current seat designs, considerable discussion and study continues to focus on the question of injury reduction with respect to AIS-1 injuries. Additionally, the less frequent but poten- tially more severe question of spinal and head injuries at higher crash exposure levels, as well as the potential adverse effects of current yielding seatback interaction with other occupants within the passenger compartment remains to be solved. Some have suggested that both the low-speed AIS-1 and the higher-speed AIS-3+ injury problem can be solved by merely increasing the strength of seatbacks to some sub- stantially higher level and then somehow limit the total amount of deflection that can occur, no matter how severe the collision [23]. This "solution" would be similar to a restraint design for frontal collisions that would sense the severity of the collision and would instantly adapt itself by changing the elongation characteristics of the belt webbing and the deployment characteristics of the airbag. Current technology does not allow this type of crash sensing and corresponding component modifica- tion that would be necessary for such a solution to be properly applied to seating systems. In order to gain insight into the relative advantages of var- ious design approaches for seat systems, it is necessary to not only consider the various types of injury exposures, but also to evaluate the crash environment in more detail. For example, if we consider the overall environment for a front-seat occupant in a rear-end collision, we see that several factors may come into play, depending on the seat system and the crash exposure considered. Figure 9. Diagram of Different Crush and Displacements in a Vehicle-to- Vehicle Crash The following sections represent four conceptual exam- ples of different seat-vehicle combinations. Figure 9 depicts the crush and displacements referenced in the examples that follow. The mutual crush represents the combination of striking vehicle and struck vehicle dynamic crush damage. During the crash, the struck vehicle and the occupant are displaced forward certain distances indicated in each of the following conceptual examples. RIGID SEAT IN A CONVENTIONAL PASSENGER CAR - First, consider a system where the seat is a theo- retically rigid attachment to the car and does not provide any structural energy absorption during the crash. Figure 10 shows a simplified crash profile for such a con- dition. In this example, the mutual vehicle crush provides the primary energy absorption mechanism for both vehi- cle and occupant. During the crush phase, the struck vehicle is accelerated and is displaced forward a distance of approximately IV2 feet. In this hypothetical crash, the occupant is inertially displaced a small amount, (a dis- tance of three inches) into the seat upholstery but does not deform the backrest structure and therefore the seat structure does not absorb any energy. In this 1897</page><page sequence="8">hypothetical crash example with a delta-V of 20 MPH, the acceleration rate for the occupant is approximately the same as that of the struck car which is 20 g's. The occu- pant's effective delta-V is also only slightly higher than that of the vehicle C.G. since there is little elastic rebound from the seat upholstery. Figure 1 0. Crash Velocity Profile of an Occupant in Close Proximity to a Rigid Seat at Impact YIELDING SEAT IN A CONVENTIONAL PASSENGER CAR - The next condition to be evaluated, represented in Figure 1 1 , is the same crash pulse as the previous exam- ple, except that the seat structure is allowed to deform during occupant inertial loading. In this example, the seatback deforms such that the occupant's upper torso displaces rearward a distance of approximately one foot while the car is accelerated forward approximately 2Vz feet. Note that by allowing the seat back to yield, the resulting longer acceleration time and distance for the occupant acceleration phase lowers his acceleration to 1 0 g's, or half the rate of that with a non-yielding seat. Figure 1 1 . Crash Velocity Profile of an Occupant in Close Proximity to a Yielding Seat at Impact RIGID SEAT IN A CONVENTIONAL PASSENGER CAR WITH FORWARD DISPLACED OCCUPANT - Both of the previous examples assume proper seating position for the occupant. In this example, a starting position with the torso six inches ahead of the seatback is assumed. As depicted in Figure 12, the occupant acceleration is delayed by its 6 inch offset and then has a similar 3 inch cushion/body compliance displacement into the rigid seat structure utilized in the first example. However, now the occupant has to "catch up" to the vehicle velocity in approximately a quarter of the time of the first example. The resulting accelerations for the occupant increase dramatically to more than double the rate in the first example where the occupant started its impact in contact with the rigid seat. This increase occurs because the occupant is not attached to the car during the critical first portion of the crash phase. Figure 12. Crash Velocity Profile of an Occupant in a Rigid Seat, Slightly Out of Position at Impact YIELDING SEAT IN A CONVENTIONAL PASSENGER CAR WITH FORWARD DISPLACED OCCUPANT - Lastly, consider the same starting position of the previous exam- ple except the seat structure is allowed to deform. As depicted in Figure 13, the effect of a similar six inch offset on the occupant in a yielding seat is relatively small. The seatback yield properties serve to limit the rate of accel- eration that can be applied to the occupant, even when he is not able to utilize all of the vehicle crash pulse. It should be noted that under this "out of position" condition for the yielding seat occupant, the actual rearward dis- placement has increased, due to the delayed interaction with the seat. Therefore, issues of ramping and increased neck motion may exist as a result of this increased displacement within the passenger compart- ment. However, when the occupant becomes "out of position" the pelvis will interact with the lower seat struc- ture before the upper body, thereby decreasing the 1898</page><page sequence="9">relative energy left to be absorbed by the upper torso and head. As the angle between the torso and seatback increases, so does the effective force component of the upper torso and head acting through the pelvis. Figure 13. Crash Velocity Profile of an Occupant in a Yielding Seat, Slightly Out of Position at Impact EVALUATION OF ACTUAL CRASH PULSES INVOLVING MOVING BARRIER TESTS - It can be seen from the preceding analyses that vehicle structural char- acteristics play a significant part in determining seat per- formance during a crash. The following analysis of actual crash data demonstrates various factors that must be considered when evaluating seat design modifications. Data files have been obtained from the referenced crash test reports and overlaid in graphical form to depict the relationship of the accelerations normal to the seatback, velocities, and seatback angle, all as a function of time [27,28,29]. Any comparison of moving barrier tests with actual car- to-car crashes must consider the fact that the barrier by design has no energy absorbing capability. For this rea- son, the extent to which the striking vehicle in a car-to-car crash absorbs energy and thereby extends the crash pulse must also be considered. Conventional Seat - Conventional Vehicle - The follow- ing example demonstrates crash charact-eristics of a conventional 4-door passenger car. The vehicle is of cur- rent design and normal construction for such a vehicle. As depicted in Figure 14, the delta-V of the vehicle is achieved in a time typical for this type of vehicle when struck by a moving barrier. Note the peak values for the three acceleration curves. The pelvis peaks at approxi- mately 50 milliseconds, the chest peaks at approximately 80 milliseconds, and the head peaks at approximately 130 milliseconds. Figure 14. Graph of Seatback Angle and Crash Accelerations as a Function of Time - Conventional Vehicle with a Yielding Seat. The phase lag shown in the curves demonstrates how extending the load normal to the seatback over a longer period of time contributes to the effectiveness of the strength and performance characteristics of the seat sys- tem. Examination of the curve representing the seatback angle over the crash duration demonstrates this perfor- mance. In Figure 15, the dynamic seatback moment about the H-point as a function of time as well as the energy absorbed as a function of seatback angle are plot- ted. Figure 15. Seatback Moment and Absorbed Energy as Seat Yields Rearward This representation is a preliminary analysis of the seat- back performance based on measured values of acceler- ation along with analyzed values of geometric position. It is observed that due to early pelvis interaction with the lower seat geometry, initial loading into the seat system occurs quickly. However, due to the lag and follow-up of the chest and head, the load is sustained over a longer period of time adding to the effective energy absorption. 1899</page><page sequence="10">Figure 16. Graph of Seatback Angle and Crash Accelerations as a Function of Time - Stiff Vehicle with a Yielding Seat Conventional Seat - Stiff Vehicle - This example depicts a stiffer SUV-type vehicle. This vehicle represents the kind of structure and associated response that one could expect out of SUVs, trucks, minivans and vans when struck by a moving barrier. As depicted in Figure 16, the delta-V for the struck vehicle is achieved in a little more than 50 milliseconds. It should be noted that the barrier is not absorbing any energy, hence the response in the vehicle structure and associated occupant is more severe than in a normal vehicle-to-vehicle crash. However, again it is interesting to note that three discrete peaks in acceleration exist for the pelvis (~70 milliseconds), chest (-100 milliseconds), and the head (-150 milliseconds). As depicted in the graph, the occupant responses are slightly higher than in the previous example. The seat- back angle graph depicts a general change in slope at approximately 100 milliseconds. It can be hypothesized that the steeper portion of the seatback angle curve is due to the early loading and interaction with the mass of the pelvis. Furthermore, a second point of inflection occurs just before 150 milliseconds. This appears to cor- relate well with the mass of the head providing additional loading. During the crash, the occupant is retained inside the seat system and reaches the vehicle velocity at the end of the seat deformation. The moment in this dynamic environ- ment is calculated using the previously described weights and moment arm distances illustrated in Figure 7. As was also indicated earlier, the moments were calculated using the "x" axis accelerations, since it is assumed that these accelerations remain approximately normal to the seatback. The energy absorbed by the seat in this dynamic environment is obtained by integrating the moment versus angular displacement. As indicated in Figure 17, the seat system resists force and absorbs energy through a substantial amount of rotation. In the static seat test seen in Figure 18, total energy absorbed was evaluated up to an angle of 60 degrees and was found to be 3662 in-lbs. Equating this energy to the kinetic energy of the occupant (X =0) the maximum delta- V or threshold velocity, where seat energy absorption would be exhausted under a simplified energy analysis, would be 7.4 mph. If 70% of the weight of the occupant were used, as proposed by some researchers, the maxi- mum delta-V would be 10.6 mph. Utilizing the delta-V of the vehicle from the dynamic test of 16.5 mph, these numbers indicate that after complete seat yield the occu- pant would have a residual velocity of 5.9 to 9.1 mph in a rearward direction relative to the vehicle. However as previously noted, examination of the film from the onboard cameras indicate very little, if any, residual velocity of the occupant. This observation is confirmed by examination of the neck data that indicate no increased loading at the point of maximum rearward excursion. Figure 1 7. Seatback Moment and Absorbed Energy as Seat Yields Rearward Figure 1 8. Graph of Static Seat Test Data for SUV Vehicle From analysis of these tests it can been seen that the basis for the previously referenced over-simplified calcu- lations is incorrect and it under-estimates the actual energy absorption of the seat/vehicle system as it per- tains to occupant retention. Therefore, while energy absorption measurement in a static test indicates energy 1900</page><page sequence="11">absorption characteristics of the seat structure itself, it cannot be applied directly as an overall evaluation of seat collision performance. Deflection-Limited Seat - Stiff Vehicle - The next exam- ple is of a two-seat vehicle with a rear bulkhead located a short distance behind the two seats. As in the concep- tual examples, this crash test demonstrates the responses of a compact stiff vehicle with seatback rota- tion limitation. Figure 19 shows a pre-test photograph alongside a post-test photograph of the driver dummy. As shown in the photograph the occupant head has an initial separation from the seat headrest of approximately 4 inches. The graphical data depictions of the various acceleration values are shown in Figure 20. Figure 1 9. Pre and Post Test Photographs ot the Driver Dummy position It is observed that the characteristic phase lags of the three discrete acceleration peaks are substantially reduced. The peaks of the pelvis, chest and head have occurred within 10 milliseconds of each other, as opposed to the 30-50 millisecond lag found previously. It is reported in the crash test report and observed in the onboard camera film that the dummy head sustains its high accelerations through contact with the seat head- rest. Figure 20. Graph of Seatback Angle and Crash Accelerations as a Function of Time - Stiff Vehicle with Limited- Yield Seat. Depicted in Figure 21 is the calculation of the seatback moment as a function of rotation angle. The 30,000+ inch-pound resistance indicated in Figure 21 is provided by interaction with the rear bulkhead, which limits motion in a rearward direction. The indicated energy absorption of the occupant is no more than that of a conventional passenger vehicle configuration. However, this energy absorption occurs in less than half of the time and dis- tance than a conventional seatback, thereby producing high acceleration values on the dummy occupant. Figure 21 . Seatback Moment and Absorbed Energy as Seat Rearward yield is limited by rear Bulkhead. 1901</page><page sequence="12">Figure 22 depicts a sequence of interior video stills of the driver dummy taken from the onboard camera. The dummy head at the start of the crash is shown to be for- ward of the headrest. The seat rearward deflection is lim- ited to approximately 18 degrees of seatback rotation. Early in the crash sequence the occupant deforms the backrest in a normal manner. The seat rotation is then stopped and the occupant "bottoms-out" against the structure. As a result of the limited amount of available deformation, or yielding, the accelerations experienced by the occupant are significantly increased. The peak acceleration level recorded by the head is 161 g's. This high acceleration value leads to a HIC which exceeds recommended limits at a crash severity where head accelerations are generally not severe. Figure 22. Occupant interacts with deflection-limited seat and rebounds rapidly. CONCLUSIONS • FMVSS 207 and FMVSS 202 are the Federal Stan- dards directly addressing the performance of seat- backs and head restraints. These standards are currently under review to be updated. Any change in the requirements should take into account the energy management considerations of current seat designs when considering potential benefits arising from stronger seats. • New data from recent government static seat testing shows a moderate trend toward stronger seat designs. Any effect of this trend on injury rates remains to be determined. • Restitution analysis conducted in the government seat research does not take into account the relation- ship of restitution to the applied load. However, the elastic to plastic transition in the load-deflection curves occurred at an average of 60 percent of the ultimate load of the tested seats which has important implications of the elasticity and resulting rebound effects of stronger seat designs. • Early research focused on identification and introduc- tion of basic concepts for controlling occupant kine- matics. More recent research has identified additional details concerning occupant kinematics and injury potential adding to the ability to better understand rear impact kinematics. • Evaluation of the frequency of rear-impact collisions shows this impact mode to be a very common colli- sion; however, the majority of rear collisions take place at severity levels where risk of serious injury and fatality are extremely low. • Lower-severity types of injuries are heavily repre- sented and the effect of strengthening seats has important implications on this injury level range. • As new seat designs become more complex and stronger to incorporate new features and safety devices, the potential adverse consequences not only to the occupant within the seat, but also on those behind and adjacent to the seat need to be evaluated. • A mathematical model was presented depicting the various factors involved with an energy analysis of seat crash performance. Energy management analy- sis and thus seatback collision performance cannot be completely evaluated without careful analysis of both the seat and the vehicle collision environments. • Velocity-Time graphical analysis is an important tool in evaluation of seat performance and occupant force levels. A conceptual analysis approach was pre- sented depicting the results of different seat-occu- pant combinations. It was shown that as an occupant becomes "out of position" for the rigid or "rigidified" seat systems, the force and resulting injury levels increase dramatically. • An evaluation of new data surrounding the recently modified FMVSS 301 standard was presented. It was shown that current seat designs are performing well by absorbing significant energy at this severity exposure. Detailed examination of the data revealed the timing of load application from dummy acceler- ometer data. This analysis shows substantial energy absorption characteristics due to delayed interaction and duration of loading. • An example was shown that depicted a deflection- limited seat with a slightly "out of position" occupant. This example directly addresses the problem of arbi- trarily limiting rearward motion given the kinematics of potential head to seat interactions. 1902</page><page sequence="13">• Additional analysis must be done to further identify the relationships between static and dynamic data. Further analysis will also be required to evaluate the neck injury properties and associated relationships to the presented data. • A new concept in energy analysis for automotive seats has been presented. This analysis took a basic understanding of energy dissipation factors present in rear collisions and constructed an over- view of energy management analysis. It was shown that a simple application of the energy equation for an assumed mass of the occupant to obtain a "threshold" delta V does not take into account how the crush of the vehicle affects the energy of the occupant and how the stiffness of the seat, in terms of rear deflection affects occupant motion and injury potential.
