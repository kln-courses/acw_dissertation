Gane Institute of Archaeology Andrews University  Andrews University Seventh-Day Adventist Theological Seminary  Berrien Springs, MI 49104 Berrien Springs, MI 49104  cchadwic@andrews.edu gane@andrews.edu The 2009 excavation season at Tall Jalul, Jordan, unearthed three inscribed objects:  (1) half of an unusual stamp seal with Hebrew script and part of a scene that may consist  of a worshipper in front of a stand, (2) an Ammonite ceramic bulla, and (3) a fragment  of an Ammonite ostracon.

The baseline is flat and the lower part of the letter  is shaped like an angular hook. Herr describes this as  a perfect Hebrew form (Herr 1978: 91), and there are  several parallels for this kind of lamed in Hebrew seals  (Avigad 1997: 186, fig. 447; Herr 1978: fig. 70), but it  is not seen in Ammonite or Moabite (cf. Avigad 1997;  Herr 1978). By contrast, the main stroke of an Am- monite lamed would be vertical at a 90o angle (Herr  1978: fig. 43), and the bottom part of the letter could  be rounded like a hook or horizontally straight out, as  in our letter “L.” The mem inclines to the right, but not to the same  degree as the lamed. The small upper strokes of the  mem are parallel to each other and close together. The  long downstroke, slanted down to the left, curves at  the bottom more radically to the left, in typical He- brew fashion. By contrast, the Ammonite mem is not  slanted; the downstroke goes straight down. Also, the  upper strokes are typically not parallel (Herr 1978:  figs. 44, 71). In Moabite, the head strokes can be par- allel but appear commonly at a 90o angle, not slanted  as in our seal (cf. Avigad 1997: fig. 1006). The head  of the mem also tends to be larger in Moabite (Avigad  1997: 372; Herr 1978: 154). Fig. 1. Stamp seal with impression.

Herr points out that whereas the patronym com- monly appears in Hebrew seals of the seventh century  (Herr 1978: 82), the single name was characteristic of  the eighth century, as was the presence of iconography  (Herr 1978: 82; Hestrin and Dayagi-Mendels 1979:  56; Sass 1993: 198). If the Hebrew identification of  our seal is correct, this places it between the eighth  and seventh centuries b.c. Interestingly, the Bible re- cords that King Jotham of Judah (eighth century b.c.)  conquered the Ammonites and exacted tribute from  them (2 Chr 27:5). Such an event could explain the  presence of a Hebrew seal in Ammonite territory about  that time, but it could have arrived there through other  circumstances.4 In terms of likely iconography above the single line  of text, the partial depiction may be reconstructed as  a cult scene with a man standing in profile in front of  a stand. Preserved are what appear to be the bottom  parts of two legs and feet facing right (in the impres- sion), and what could possibly be a stand, or an ankh  sign. A thin line connects the legs in what may be in- terpreted as the hem of a long garment (see fig. 1c). The kind of scene just described is a common  motif  in Northwest Semitic seals, but according to Sass,  there are no known Hebrew seals of a worshipper be- Fig. 2.
