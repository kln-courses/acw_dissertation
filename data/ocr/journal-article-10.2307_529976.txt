Geib Navajo Nation Archaeology Department Flagstaff, Arizona Helen C. Fairley National Park Service Grand Canyon, Arizona Some measure of chronometric control is essential if the important symbolic content ofprehis- toric rock art is to be fully exploited for interpretative purposes. The relative stylistic chronol- ogies proposedfor rock art in various regions of the world are hypotheses needing to be tested. Two recently-processed radiocarbon dates provide the first chronometric evaluation of the suggested chronology for Fremont anthropomorphic depiction on the northern Colorado Pla- teau of the North American Southwest. A perishable artifact associated with a large picto- graph panel was dated 1200 ? 80 years b.p., while AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) dating of charcoal pigment of a pictograph from an adjacent site yielded an age of 675 ? 55 years b.p. These radiocarbon determinations have important implications for the cul- ture history ofsouth-central Utah. The dates come from previously-unrecorded rock art sites that exemplify the elaborate nature ofanthropomorph pictographs in the extreme sE portion of the Fremont region. Introduction Dating prehistoric rock art is notoriously difficult, yet without a chronology, prehistoric pictures can not be ac- curately linked to the cultures that produced them. As Schaafsma (1985:241-242) observes, "if rock art imagery is to be successfully integrated with its cultural matrix, a necessary step for its use as an archaeological resource, there has to be some means of locating it in time." A variety of methods have been used to provide relative chronological ordering of rock art (e.g., Meighan 1981; Schaafsma 1980:13-17), but the temporal and cultural placement of specific images or styles is still largely con- jectural. The relative stylistic chronologies proposed for various regions of the world are hypotheses that require testing. Some preliminary testing has been done using experimental methods for dating rock art (e.g., Bard, Asaro, and Heizer 1978; Dorn, Nobbs, and Cahill 1988; Dorn and Whitley 1983; Loy et al. 1990; van der Merwe, Sealy, and Yates 1987), with some results generally cor- roborating suggested style sequences and others indicating a need for revision. We report two radiocarbon dates that provide for the first time an important chronometric eval- uation of the suggested chronology for Fremont anthro- pomorphic depiction of the northern Colorado Plateau of the sw United States. The dates come from previously- unrecorded rock art sites that exemplify the elaborate na- ture of anthropomorph pictographs in a zone of interac- tion between the Fremont and the Anasazi, two horticul- tural populations occupying adjacent portions of the Colorado Plateau. Background Glen Canyon, situated in south-central Utah, is one of a series of spectacularly scenic canyons cut by the Colorado River and its tributaries into the uplifted geologic strata of the Colorado Plateau (FIG. 1). Parts of the Glen Canyon north of the Colorado River, especially in the Escalante River Basin, contain material remains of a Fremont oc- cupation, including rod and bundle coiled basketry, Emery and Snake Valley gray ceramics, distinctive figurines and moccasins, and "Fremont Dent" maize (Fowler 1963; Gunnerson 1959). Though not directly dated, this Fre- mont occupation was thought to have been contempora- neous with an Anasazi occupation of Glen Canyon that spanned approximately two centuries from about A.C. 1050-1200 or 1250 (Fowler 1963:13; Fowler and Aikens 1963:9; Lister 1964:20).</page><page sequence="2">156 Dating Fremont Rock Art in Utah/Geib and Fairley N 0 10 20 miles N San Rafael 0 20 km Desert , 4,River Par- a MonuHeen .

The SE portion of Utah and the NE portion of Arizona, showing Glen Canyon in relation to major topographic features and drainages. The general location of the three rock art sites described in this article is marked with a triangle. Rock art, particularly in the form of broad-shouldered, often horned anthropomorphs, is another material trace of the Fremont occupation of Glen Canyon. Most Fre- mont rock art in Glen Canyon occurs north of the Colo- rado River, and is well represented in the Escalante River Basin. The Davis Gulch pictograph panel (Gunnerson 1959:150, fig. 46) is an outstanding example of rock art in this basin, and recent survey has documented other fine examples of Fremont rock art panels (e.g., Eininger and Metzger 1985; Geib, Fairley, and Bungart 1986). Schaafsma (1980:166) notes that "the hallmark of Fre- mont rock art everywhere is the broad-shouldered human figure in ceremonial regalia." A tapering torso and horned or other elaborate headgear are typical, as are heavy neck- laces of dots or solid "yokes," earrings, and sashes. There is also a variety of production techniques, including solid pecking, outlining, incising, drilling, and painting, with multiple techniques often combined in a single figure. Schaafsma (1971, 1980:163) believes that regional vari- ation in Fremont rock art corresponds to Marwitt's (1970) five regional variants of Fremont culture. Two of these variants, San Rafael and Uinta, include the Fremont ex- pression on the northern Colorado Plateau; rock art of the latter is designated as the "Classic Vernal style," while the "San Rafael style" characterizes the former (Schaafsma 1986:223). Fremont rock art of the Glen Canyon area is classified as part of the San Rafael style (e.g., Schaafsma 1971:7, 55-57, fig. 2). Dating of the Fremont rock art styles is based on the temporal placement of Fremont culture in general, a sub- ject of past controversy (e.g., Ambler 1969; Gunnerson 1969; Marwitt 1970). Marwitt's (1970:137-145) chro- nology, which is now generally accepted, places the San Rafael Fremont, and by extension the San Rafael rock art style, between about A.c. 700-1200. Given that the Fre- mont occupation of Glen Canyon is thought to date roughly A.c. 1050 to 1200 or 1250, the associated rock art of this area should be of corresponding age.</page><page sequence="3">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 19, 1992 157 vw : V.4: :: ::::: ls : : :::: N?- i:-i.:. :..: V:::: : IN . _ : -_ : -: : :.:. ::-- : : .

Environmental setting of the three rock art sites. The series of arrows denote the single set of prehistoric hand- and toe-holds pecked into the rock face to access Dios Blancos. The Sites Location and Setting The three adjacent sites examined in this paper are lo- cated in a canyon that drains the southern portion of the Waterpocket Fold and empties into the Colorado River in Glen Canyon (FIG. i). This canyon is at the extreme SE limits of Fremont territory, in what has been viewed as a boundary zone between Fremont and Anasazi populations (Jennings 1978:95). Indeed, evidence of both Fremont and Anasazi habitation occurs in this canyon (Geib, Fair- ley, and Bungart 1986) and in adjacent canyons of the Escalante drainage north of the Colorado River (Fowler 1963; Geib, Bungart, and Fairley 1987; Gunnerson 1959; Lister 1958). While Anasazi habitations occur north of the Colorado River, no Fremont habitations and few Fre- mont remains have been documented south of the river. The three sites are located in SE-facing alcoves formed in Navajo Sandstone (FIG. 2), a massive, crossbedded, Jurassic dune deposit exposed over large portions of the Colorado Plateau. Two of the sites, Horned Men Alcove (42KA2738) and Ceremonial Cave (42KA2739), are sit- uated next to one another at the level of the principal alluvial terrace in the canyon. The third site, Dios Blancos (42KA2836), is situated in a hanging alcove immediately upslope from Ceremonial Cave, at an elevation 30 m above the floodplain. These sites are directly across the canyon from an easy access route leading to the Water- pocket Fold (see FIG. 1). Dios Blancos is a rock art site only; it lacks structural or artifactual remains of habitation. Diverse trash and features at the other two sites led us to conclude that each could have functioned as a habitation, at least for part of the year. The sites are situated where potential farmland</page><page sequence="4">158 Dating Fremont Rock Art in Utah/Geib and Fairley :.. .. .. ..........................:...............................................................

Adjacent to arable land, protected from precipitation, and facing the sun, these lower shelters provided ideal living locations for horticul- turalists. Horned Men Alcove The 600 sq m of dry, mostly-level living space of this well-protected alcove is littered on the surface with cul- tural remains, including grinding tools, ceramics, flaked lithics, food scraps (maize cobs, cucurbit rinds, bone), and various other organic remains. (Preservation of ancient organic artifacts and debris is normal in the arid Southwest if they are protected from precipitation or ground mois- ture.) Buried, charcoal-stained cultural strata are visible in profile along the eroding front of the alcove. Exposed features include bell-shaped cists excavated into calcified sediment and a rectangular, dry-laid, low-walled structure built against the rear wall of the alcove. Several large roof spalls are covered with grinding surfaces, sharpening grooves, pecked depressions, and meandering lines. Sim- ilar pecked elements occur on the sloping bedrock of the alcove wall, along with the anthropomorphic pictographs for which the site is named. Ceremonial Cave A somewhat restricted entrance and dense tree growth impart a cave-like darkness to this shelter (FIG. 3A). The 670 sq m of protected floor space exhibits a paucity of surface cultural debris, an apparent consequence of post- occupational alluvial and eolian deposition, plus an abun- dance of cow dung. The most obvious evidence of occu- pation includes a large roof spall covered with grinding surfaces and four panels of anthropomorphs painted along the back wall. Some artifacts and charcoal-stained soil are exposed in an arroyo cut at the front of the alcove. Dios Blancos This higher alcove is a shallow overhang that faces from east to south in a broad arc. Only the south-facing portion is at all protected from precipitation, and here is where the principal pictograph panel is located (FIG. 3B). This panel extends about 35 m along the alcove wall and up to 3 m above the narrow ledge that served as a walking and working surface. A few faint traces of other picto- graphs are evident in less protected portions of the alcove. Dios Blancos is accessible only by a single series ofhand- and toe-holds (steps) that have been pecked into the nearly sheer rock face immediately next to the entrance of Cer- emonial Cave (see FIG. 2). Natural weathering of the fri- able sandstone has completely obliterated all but the lower 3 m of the steps, and those remaining are shallow, unus- able depressions. Owing to the friable nature of the sand- stone, it is likely that the steps would have been unusable a century or two after being made. We reached the alcove in a helicopter and are perhaps the first visitors to the site, certainly the first historical visitors, since the artists left the canyon. The only feature besides the rock art is a small, squarish cairn on the narrow ledge of the alcove immediately in front of the best preserved and most dramatic portion of the rock art panel (FIG. 3B). Sandstone spalls from the alcove were crudely stacked to form this cairn, which stands about 50 cm high and 60 cm across. This feature contained a worked stick, the single artifact found at the site. The Rock Art Horned Men Alcove The principal rock art figures of this alcove are a series of full-body anthropomorphs, roughly 1.3 m in length, that occur along the eastern portion of the back wall (FIG. 4). All figures appear quite similar, although some are so exfoliated that we cannot be certain of this. They were created by a combination of incising and polychrome painting, with drilling used for decorative touches in a few instances (FIG. 4B). The rock surface was first prepared by grinding it smooth; then the figures, including feet, hands, and horned headgear, were completely outlined by incision. The torsos are shaped like disproportionate hour- glasses, with the upper two-thirds separated from the lower third by belts or sashes defined by one or more abraded horizontal lines, combined in some cases with white or gray paint. The flaring lower portion of the torso appears to represent a skirt or kilt. The entire bodies of some figures, including appendages, are painted gray, but in other figures the body is apparently unpainted except for the kilt. In the latter cases, the incised lines outlining the body were filled with gray paint. Nearly all of the figures have simple, solidly painted, yoke-type necklaces. These are executed in white paint if the torsos are painted gray, but for unpainted torsos the yokes are painted in gray (or gray over red in one instance). Some of the heads are bucket-shaped or blocky while others are round. One figure has a distinct neck with a series of lines incised across it as decorative treatment; lines are also incised across the face of this figure and may represent tattoos (FIG. 4B). At least two of the figures clearly have pendant earrings painted in gray and dark gray. All but one of the figures have elaborate multicolored headgear with upright, curving horns. Most of the head- dresses have a horizontal red band sandwiched between horizontal white and gray bands, but in two instances</page><page sequence="6">160 Dating Fremont Rock Art in Utah/Geib and Fairley A B Figure 4.

B) Close up of torso and head of a figure that measures 1.1 m from horn tips to hem of "kilt"; note the incised lines used to frame the body outline and for facial decoration; the body is unpainted and the "yoke" consists of gray over red; the headdress consists of a gray band above a red band above a white band, and the horns are painted in white; this figure is clearly superimposed over at least two previous anthropomorphs of the same style, one of which had horns consisting in part of drilled holes. there are short, red, vertical lines. The horns are usually painted in white, but at least one figure has horns of multiple alternating bands of gray and white pigment, with each horn consisting of two white lines between three grey lines. Two of the figures apparently hold a fringed staff, a theme repeated at Ceremonial Cave and Dios Blancos. In one case the staff is defined by an abraded line filled with white paint. Thirteen short lines painted white with gray tips are pendant from the staff and could be representa- tions of eagle feathers (see Smith 1952:175). An un- painted fringed staff is incised diagonally across the torso of another figure (FIG. 4A). Ceremonial Cave There are traces of at least 26 polychrome anthropo- morphs grouped into 4 panels along the back of this alcove (see FIG. 3A). The lower bodies of most of these poorly preserved pictographs have been lost to exfoliation. The most complete figure measures 1.4 m in height from the bottom of its kilt to the horn tips and the other figures apparently were of comparable size or slightly shorter. At</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 19, 1992 161 least four figures have fringed staffs, including one with a red fringe at Panel 1. The figures of each panel are gen- erally similar to those of Horned Men Alcove and clearly of the same style. There are, however, differences among each of the four panels, particularly with respect to pig- ments and details of the heads and upper torsos. For example, charcoal is a principal pigment only for Panel 1, where it was used to paint the bodies, heads, and horned head gear of five partially preserved figures (FIG. 5) (three other figures are evidenced by partial, incised body out- lines). At least three of the Panel 1 figures have upright slightly curved double horns in charcoal and two of these have short lines dangling from them. In contrast, of the six anthropomorphs still partially discernible at panel 2, one has a single white "feather" protruding from near the center of its gray headband, while the others have horns of single white lines outlined by gray lines, with short white and grey lines dangling from their mid-portion; four of these are unusual because of their widely splayed horns. A distinctive feature of Panel 4 is the yellow, red, and white pigment used to outline the bucket-shaped heads for two of the three partially preserved anthropomorphs. Dios Blancos There are over 30 separate figures, mostly anthropo- morphs, painted in white clay on the unprepared surface of the alcove (FIG. 6). These figures extend about 35 m along the alcove wall and up to 3 m above the narrow ledge that served as a walking and working surface. Many of the figures are faded and difficult to discern due to weathering of the paint by precipitation blowing onto the paintings or running down the face of the alcove. This weathering has eroded much essential detail from some figures, making their outlines appear unusual. Where most protected, the figures are the sharpest and most dramatic (FIG. 7). Various horned or capped anthropomorphs are the principal subjects of the panel; important secondary ele- ments include wavy lines and fringed lines, both frequently superimposed over the anthropomorphs. One of the fringed lines is clearly held by both hands of one anthro- pomorph. The figures of this panel are distinctive from those of the other two sites in both style and technique of production. A high degree of variation characterizes Figure 5. Five of the largely faded anthropomorph pictographs of Panel 1 at Ceremonial Cave, site 42KA2739. A sample from the charcoal painted horns and upper headdress band on the central figure has an AMS radiocarbon date of 675 - 55 years b.p. (AA-5223). N?l WWI mm AlwQ MSI, AW ?M, xMMMI lw e5b::.

It is worth mentioning that the fringed line motif might be represented in miniature by a category of perishable artifact designated as "problematical objects" (Morss 1931:74), split sticks folded back and wrapped around on themselves creating a fringe (FIG. 8). These items were part of the distinctive assemblage of material remains that Morss (1931) used to define the Fremont culture. They have been recovered from both late Archaic (preagricul- tural and preceramic) and early Fremont contexts (agri- cultural, plain gray pottery only) at a variety of Utah sites (see Hewitt 1980:72; Schroedl 1976:70-75). One ex- ample was recovered from an alcove 1 km downstream from the rock art sites considered here (FIG. 8). Dating Dios Blancos The worked stick recovered inside the rock cairn at the base of the pictograph panel (see FIG. 7) was securely held by the stones and must have been placed there during the cairn's construction. This cairn and the pictographs are the only evidence of alcove use, access to which was im- possible prior to pecking the hand- and toe-holds up the rock face. Consequently, we believe that the cairn and the rock art panel are contemporaneous. It stretches credibility to imagine that someone pecked the steps up the cliff face to the alcove just to leave a stick under some rocks. It also seems implausible that later visitors would have built the cairn and deposited the stick without adding rock art to the alcove, though this possibility can not be entirely ruled out. All of the figures are painted with the same white pigment and are similar in style and subject matter. De- spite crowding, there are no superimpositions of the an- thropomorphs, and the wavy and fringed lines that overlay these figures appear to be essential, symbolic elements of the overall composition. The stick (FIG. 9) (L. 250 mm, D. 11 mm) is the worked twig of a shrub (cf. Rhamnus sp.). When green, the stick was split in half, debarked, and partially shaped by shaving or whittling; one end was rounded by abrasion. A radio- carbon date on this stick avoids the "old wood problem" (e.g., Smiley 1985), since it was worked while green, and there is a maximum of three growth rings. A portion of the stick submitted to Beta Analytic for standard radiocarbon analysis yielded a date of 1200 + 80 years b.p. (Beta-21236). The calibrated midpoint of this date is A.c. 870 with a one sigma age range of A.c. 689-897 and two sigma range of A.c. 660-1000 (cali- 7 broken Figure 8. So called "problematical objects" that might be miniature representations of the fringed lines held by some of the Fremont an- tropomorphs: top; from an alcove (site 42KA2754) located about 1 km down-canyon from Dios Blancos, it measures 7.5 cm long and is broken on one end; bottom, a whole example from Cowboy Cave showing the opposite side from that of A, this item measures 13.8 cm long (redrawn from fig. 33 in Hewitt [1980:74]). bration based on the 1987 CALIB program using the 20- year data set; Stuiver and Reimer 1986). Based on the very likely association of this artifact with the panel, we believe that its '4C age provides an accurate estimate of the time period when the Dios Blancos pictographs were painted. The stylistic, technical, and compositional unity of the pictographs lead us to conclude that only one gen- eral period of painting is represented at the site. Ceremonial Cave Trace amounts of organic carbon in rock art pigments can be directly dated using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) (e.g., Loy et al. 1990; van der Merwe, Sealy, and Yates 1987). Although the AMS technique is well estab- lished, its use for the direct dating of rock art is only beginning to be explored. A drawback of '4C is its destruc- tive nature, since pigment must be removed. The amount of surface area needed to produce a useful date depends on the thickness of pigment application, the quantity of organic carbon in a pigment, and the acceptable counting Figure 9.

(Beta-21236). 10 cm</page><page sequence="10">164 Dating Fremont Rock Art in Utah/Geib and Fairley error. Owing to the minute quantities of material required for AMS dating (as little as 40 millionths of a gram; Loy et al. 1990), no panel need be seriously damaged, so the scientific gains of the procedure far outweigh the partial losses. The horns and upper headdress band for one of the panel 1 figures retains a relatively thick coat of charcoal pigment (see FIG. 5). Thin sandstone flakes covered with the charcoal pigment were removed from the alcove wall directly into aluminum foil using a knife. Most of these flakes were small, naturally-loosened exfoliation spalls. About 2 sq cm of pictograph surface area was removed to provide a sample with a small sigma. Analysis was carried out by Douglas Donahue of the NSF Accelerator Laboratory, University of Arizona. Prep- aration and processing of the sample proceeded normally, and the accelerator analysis gave a '4C age of 675 - 55 years b.p. (AA-5223; 'C delta value is -25.4). The cal- ibrated midpoint of this date is A.C. 1284, with a 1-sigma age range of A.C. 1272-1379 and a 2-sigma age range of A.C. 1250-1400. One concern about this date is whether wood charcoal was used to paint the figure, since the "old wood problem" could potentially result in an overestimation of age. Given the probable importance of painting the anthropomorphs, it is conceivable that special, identifiable wood would be burned to prepare the charcoal pigment, in which case the old wood problem might not apply. In this particular case, since the date suggests a more recent age for Fremont rock art than commonly assumed, age overestimation does not seem a major concern. If old wood charcoal was used, then Fremont rock art is potentially younger still, and the issues raised about this date in the discussion below would still apply. It is also possible that the pigment was contaminated in some way, and that the date underestimates the period of painting. No environmental contamination such as bird or bat guano, water staining, or lichen growth was dis- cernible during sample removal. There was, however, a thin layer of smoke soot on the rock surface over which the anthropomorphs had been painted. This smoke stain, however, would potentially result in age overestimation. Discussion and Implications We have obtained two divergent dates for Fremont rock art at adjacent sites, with a difference of several centuries. The Dios Blancos date is near the beginning of Marwitt's (1970:143-145) proposed temporal span for the San Ra- fael Fremont (ca. A.C. 700-1200), and, by extension, Schaafsma's proposed temporal span for San Rafael Style rock art. The date is partly corroborated by a cross-media comparison with clay figurines from Gates Roost (Gun- nerson 1959:44, fig. 15), an excavated site in Twenty-five Mile Canyon of the Escalante River Basin. A recently- dated maize sample from Gates Roost has a calibrated 1- sigma age range of A.C. 564-664 (Geib and Phagan n.d.). Four of the clay figurine fragments associated with this date are lower torsos with "kilts" of vertical clay fillets that are comparable with the lower torsos of anthropomorphs of Dios Blancos that exhibit painted "fringes." The Dios Blancos date is, however, at odds with the traditional argument that the Fremont occupation of Glen Canyon was from about A.C. 1050-1200 or 1250 (e.g., Fowler 1963:13; Fowler and Aikens 1963:9; Lister 1964:20). The dating of Fremont symbolic expression to the 9th century provides prima facie support for an earlier Fremont presence in Glen Canyon. This follows from the belief that rock art is at least as significant as other material remains for defining cultural commonality (see Schaafsma 1985:267), and that absolutely-dated rock art provides a sound basis for tracing the spatial and temporal distribu- tion of cultural groups. Additional recent radiocarbon determinations for non- art sites of the Escalante River Basin reveal an overlapping series of dates spanning the centuries from about A.C. 200 through 1000, with the Dios Blancos date in the later third of this distribution (FIG. 10). Since many of these radiocarbon determinations prior to A.C. 1000 are on maize from excavated Fremont sites such as Triangle Cave, Sheep Horn Alcove, and Pantry Alcove in Harris Wash (Fowler 1963), it is evident that Fremont horticulturalists occupied the Escalante River Basin much earlier than orig- inally thought. Indeed, the unbroken date distribution supports the proposition that the Fremont occupation in Glen Canyon developed out of a preceramic "ancestral" culture that occupied the area during the first few centuries after Christ (Geib and Bungart 1989). Since the Dios Blancos panel was apparently painted 500-600 years later, there is a potentially long period during which the rock art style could have developed. The size and complexity of the Dios Blancos panel certainly suggests that it is the product of a relatively long tradition of rock painting. Given that the proposed preceramic Fremont occupa- tion north of the Colorado River in Glen Canyon is at least partly contemporaneous with the Basketmaker II an- cestral Anasazi occupation south and east of this river, the similarities between Basketmaker II and Fremont anthro- pomorph depictions noted by Schaafsma (1971:139-141, 1980:181) may reflect a long period of contact between separate ethnic groups.

(1989); Geib, Bungart, and Fairley (1987); Geib and Phagan (n.d.); and this report. Dates without symbols are on wood charcoal; A = artifact, B = bean, C = maize, G = grass, J = juniper twigs, R = rock art, S = squash. Dates on cultigens and grass have been corrected for "3C fractionation. but, by virtue of recent radiocarbon dating, such a gap is no longer apparent. She hypothesized that elaborate an- thropomorphic depiction of the Fremont and the Basket- maker groups "is connected with historically related sha- manistic practices" (Schaafsma 1980:180). It seems equally plausible that anthropomorphs might have served as a visual lingua franca of social comparison (Wiessner 1989). The rock art of the central Glen Canyon region is just one aspect of material culture during the period from about A.c. 200 to 1000 that reflects a sharp spatial dis- continuity coinciding geographically with the Colorado River. Rock art, particularly elaborate anthropomorphs, may have been one means to overtly symbolize ethnic affiliations and differences. The Dios Blancos date was processed first, and initially we thought that the rock art of Ceremonial Cave and Horned Men Alcove was of comparable antiquity. Despite obvious stylistic differences between the Dios Blancos an- thropomorphs and those of the other two sites, it seemed that "functional" differences could account for the stylistic variability-a difference between public and non-public rock art: the upper alcove, with limited access and no evidence of habitation, serving a different pictorial pur- pose than the easily accessible, and apparently inhabited lower alcoves. Though the possibility of non-contempor- aneity was entertained, the magnitude of disparity be- tween the two dates was unexpected. In hindsight, tem- poral differences provide a parsimonious explanation for the contrasts between the Dios Blancos pictographs and those of the other two sites. There are two important questions concerning the rel- atively late date for Ceremonial Cave: 1) is there any evidence in the nature of the rock art itself that might refute or support its temporal placement?; 2) is there any evidence for occupation of the area during the time period in question? With regard to the first issue, a critical bit of information is the lack of any superimposition of other rock art over the anthropomorphs, either at Ceremonial Cave or at Horned Men Alcove. The latter site clearly had evidence of Anasazi occupation and the presence of some Anasazi-like petroglyphs on the alcove wall. The only in- stance of superimposition was historical cowboy graffiti at Panel 4 of Ceremonial Cave. Also of importance with regard to the first question is the fact that for the dated figure and many other figures at Ceremonial Cave and Homed Men Alcove, much of the rock surface had been</page><page sequence="12">166 Dating Fremont Rock Art in Utah/Geib and Fairley ground smooth prior to executing the anthropomorphs. Since traces of paint, incised lines, and other marks are apparent next to and under some of the ground surfaces (see FIG. 4B), the grinding could have been done to erase rock art of earlier periods. This might be expected for a late use of the site. Polly Schaafsma (personal communi- cation 1990) has reached a similar conclusion for ground rock surfaces of 18th-century Navajo rock art sites. It is perhaps noteworthy in this regard that the rock surface of the earlier Dios Blancos panel was not ground prior to painting. As concerns the second issue, there is conclusive evi- dence that the canyon was occupied during the time pe- riod of the Ceremonial Cave radiocarbon date. This evi- dence consists of two small brush structures built against one side of a large cave. The structures have walls of juniper branches, broken from trees while green, and floors (bedding) of grass up to 5 cm thick. Juniper twigs from one structure yielded a radiocarbon date of 570 +- 130 b.p. (GX-10503; Agenbroad et al. 1989:350). To verify this significant date, a sample of the grass floor from one of the structures was recently processed, yielding a date of 610 ? 50 b.p. (Beta-38341). An average of these two contemporaneous dates is 605 ? 47 b.p., calibrated 1-sigma age range of A.c. 1289-1402 and a 2-sigma range of A.c. 1279-1418. Two grinding slabs are the only ar- tifacts firmly associated with these structures. If we accept the Ceremonial Cave date, then San Rafael style Fremont rock art lasted far later than previously thought, up through the time period that is critical for clarifying the poorly understood demise of the Fremont during the time A.c. 1250 to 1350 (see review in Lindsay 1986). Fremont sites dating to this late time period are scattered throughout central Utah and clustered along the NE Utah-Nw Colorado border (Liestman 1985; Lindsay 1986; Talbot and Wilde 1989). The Ceremonial Cave date is, however, the latest determination on Fremont remains from the San Rafael area. A 14th-century date from one of the Bull Creek sites (42WN981) is on a non-cultural charcoal lens buried in alluvium (Jennings and Sammons- Lohse 1981:17). If Fremont groups were occupying por- tions of Glen Canyon during the latter part of the 13th century, they would have closely followed the Anasazi, who were abandoning the region during this time. Since there are no tree-ring dates younger than A.c. 1275 for the latest Anasazi habitations on the highlands immedi- ately south of Glen Canyon (Bannister, Dean, and Rob- inson 1969), it seems reasonable that these people must have completely left the area by A.c. 1290. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that the Anasazi had retracted from the Glen Canyon lowlands by about A.c. 1260 (Lipe 1970:136). Perhaps scattered Fremont populations were taking up temporary residency in areas and sites recently vacated by the Anasazi. This possibility has a bearing on the interpretation of a localized Fremont rock art style of Canyonlands National Park, SE Utah, known as the "Faces Motif" (Noxon and Marcus 1985). This style, which consists of elaborate painted anthropomorph torsos and heads with close sim- ilarities to Fremont figurines (Schaafsma 1971:52), is commonly associated with western Mesa Verde architec- ture and ceramics (Noxon and Marcus 1985). Sharrock (1966:61-67) speculated that the Mesa Verde Anasazi borrowed Fremont rock art motifs, while Ambler (1970) suggested that the rock art may have been painted by Fremont hunters predating or contemporaneous with the Mesa Verde occupation. In light of the Ceremonial Cave date, it is plausible that the Faces Motif postdates the Mesa Verde occupation, the panels having been painted by Fremont who reoccupied the abandoned structures and sites in Canyonlands. As with the Ceremonial Cave and Horned Men Alcove pictographs, the Faces Motif paint- ings are not superimposed by other aboriginal depictions, and in a few cases they are superimposed over other styles of rock art (e.g., site 42SA1629). Conclusion We have reported two radiocarbon dates for Fremont anthropomorphic depiction in Glen Canyon-a standard date on a perishable artifact that we believe was securely associated with a large, inaccessible rock art panel, and an AMS determination directly on charcoal pigment of an anthropomorph from an adjacent site. Both of these dates provide important new insights into the culture history of south-central Utah and raise many new questions for fu- ture investigation. Opportunities to directly date rock art must be pursued, for without a firm basis for historical ordering, rock art can not be fully exploited in archaeology; research would remain in a classificatory-descriptive mode. Accelerator radiocarbon dating has greatly increased the potential for directly dating rock paintings, but this procedure has yet to be fully exploited in rock art research. Certainly we must not ignore the numerous and diverse potential sources of error in radiocarbon dating (see Smiley 1985), but it is equally important not to let hypothesized stylistic chronologies dictate which dates are acceptable and which are not. The great promise for providing chronometric control to place prehistoric rock paintings in temporal relation to one another is of undeniable significance, and one that should be brought to fruition through well- designed research programs for dating rock art in various</page><page sequence="13">Journal of FieldArchaeology!/Vol. 19, 1992 167 areas. It will be especially important to investigate various potential sources of contamination and seek to identify the origin(s) of the organic carbon fraction in dated pig- ments.
