Osaka: National Museum of Ethnology, 1984 The primary focus of Kuroda's work is the civil-religious organisation and annual cycle of religious festivals of two highland Mixe towns. The author's fieldwork was carried out in the mid-seventies, when both towns were ex- periencing drastic socioeconomic change with the opening up of a road and the advent of several state development agencies and renewed Catholic missionary activity. These develop- ments, particularly the road, transformed both towns from relatively unimportant Mixe vil- lages into focal, intermediary marketing towns between the national economy and the villages in the hinterlands. Kuroda meticulously docu- ments and analyses the changes in the civil- religious organisation and rituals resulting from these developments. The author's comprehen- sive description of western Mixe social organ- isation and community festivals is, in view of the paucity of information on this important Oaxacan group, a welcome contribution to the ethnographic literature. In marked contrast to the ones studied by the author, the majority of Mixe villages are not marked by drastic economic growth and strong federal and missionary influence. It is this factor which limits the generic extent and validity of many of the author's conclusions, such as that the hierarchical religious cargo system is not widespread among the Mixe. Since the author is concerned with Mixe ritual, she also discusses what she terms the 'sacrificial complex'. Yet, like Ralph L. Beals before her, she never got beyond describing the remnants of rites which she encountered in the countryside nor does she have a clear idea of the belief system underlying these rituals. Although her translation of Mixe 'objects for devotion' appear to be elements of nature, they are in fact anthropomorphic divin- ities whose titles are derived from the natural world. The proverbial notion of deities being projections of the forces of nature is, surprising- ly, reflected upon by the Mixe and rejected. Although the author is entitled to focus on Catholic feasts rather than native-oriented rituals, she goes beyond her data to state, for example, that native rituals are poorly de- veloped and unelaborate (p. 91, 183); that the Mixe have no indigenous rituals for rainfall (p. 92) and that Mixe shamans do not pray when sucking object-intrusions (p. 94). Mixe rituals are anything but 'poorly developed' and it is in fact an oration which shamans recite under their breath, which enables them to remove object- intrusions. Although the majority (85 per cent.) of the people in both municipalities studied live away from the community centre in centripetally- dispersed hamlets and homesteads, Kuroda did not study the way of life there and rehed unduly</page><page sequence="2">572 BOOK REVIEWS upon bilingual development workers and Salesian missionaries for her information. Had she walked past the gatekeepers and taken 'the narrow road to the deep north', in the spsrit of her illustrious countryman and poet- traveller Matsuo Basho, her conception of Mixe reality and research results would have been somewhat different.
