<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE IN GOD: A REPLY CHARLES HARTSHORNE 1YJ.ETAPHYSIGS is a difficult subject. Anyone who writes a book in it and then reads a review of the book will be ready to admit this, whether or not he was before. I find certain passages in Julian Hartt's review of my Logic of Perfection1 obscure or misleading and I suggest the following efforts at clarification. I am not attempting to assess blame for any misunderstandings. This is largely a fruitless undertaking. Perhaps I wrote badly. Or perhaps it is impossible to write well for every type of reader, philosophical and theological. Memory, says my critic, is as anthropomorphic as will, and Spinoza forcibly argued against admitting will in God. But, since Spinoza's argument on this point rested squarely upon the premise, which I reject, that God is wholly immutable and devoid of con tingency, why should this be brought up as an objection to my position? Also, how "human" is unqualified or perfect memory? As Bergson well points out, forgetting is the primary operation in man. And of course I attribute the perfected form of will, as well as of memory, to God. Is God the efficient cause of creatures? I have never denied and often affirmed it. What I have denied is only that He is their exclusive and completely determining efficient cause, the reason being that in this philosophy (a) every individual is partly self determining and (b) every concrete effect has numerous causes, among which God is supreme but not sole. Yet God is as truly efficient as anything is, and even this is an infinite understatement since he alone is universally and with ideal efficiency causative. To call the supreme or eminent creative power "the creator" is a natural and, properly understood, a correct expression. To deny flatly that God creates the world is misleading, and I have avoided 1 This Review, XVI (June, 1963), pp. 749-769.</page><page sequence="2">290 CHARLES HARTSHORNE doing so. Such a denial fits Aristotle far better than it does me. ("Creation ex nihilo" I do reject as a proper definition of the eminence of the divine creativity.) That "becoming includes being" means that the total reality, what becomes and what does not become, itself ?ecomes. Simi larly, the total truth, including both necessary and contingent truths, is itself (the total truth) contingent. Correlating con tingency with becoming, and reality with truth, we see that becoming is the inclusive form of reality. It follows that the purely necessary, which does not become, can only be an abstrac tion from the total concrete reality. This was my real "dialectical move against Findlay," that the ontological argument need not commit the absurdity of deriving something concrete from an abstract definition?provided one grants that God merely qua necessary is abstract, and that the concrete God is contingent and undemonstrable. Here we come to a subtle ambiguity which seems to haunt portions of the review. Since what is concrete and contingent in God is not demonstrable, while the God of a particular worshipper, his God, is concrete, it seems that the God of the Proof has little to do with religion. Yet there is a connection, for included in the divine necessity to which the Argument concludes is the abstrac tion, necessarily concretized somehow, in appropriate relation to whatever world exists. Thus the reviewer's suggestion that deity might, like justice, be an unactualized ideal having being only as such (as an abstraction) merely amounts to the declaration that the Proof is invalid. Perhaps so, but the reviewer did not show that it was. I define "existence" in general as that the abstraction, whatever one is in question, is "somehow concretized"; and I dis tinguish the necessity (in the divine case) of the that from the con tingency of the how. Hartt seems to envisage the line between necessary and contingent as coming, not between that and how, but between both, on one side, and the bare unembodied abstrac tion, divineness or perfection, on the other. But this is to miss entirely what my move against Findlay actually was. (Findlay himself, incidentally, does understand it.) That Hartt hasn't grasped this point seems to be shown, for example, by his saying that it cannot be because He is abstractly</page><page sequence="3">ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE IN GOD: A REPLY 291 perfect that God has access to all the past. On the contrary, "having perfect memory" is an extreme abstraction (it specifies not a single concrete item of the things remembered) and in this abstractness it is connoted (as somehow actualized) by the neces sarily concretized divine Unsurpassability. Memory of this or that actual event is concrete, but the contingency of any particular memory is quite compatible with the generic necessity of "re membering whatever events there are to remember." The reviewer seems not to have noted the difference between the variable, "remembering whatever has happened" and the value of the variable, "remembering this which has happened," where "this" is a demonstrative in use. My whole reasoning depends upon this distinction, as much as upon anything. To know that God remembers all that happens we need only understand the necessity of his existing as Unsurpassable. To know what events he remembers and how, concretely, he envisages them, we must not only know what events have occurred, we must also inspect the actual divine states of awareness. To do the latter, unless in some extremely meager way, is beyond us. But just to know that "nothing escapes the divine memory," this very abstract truth, is infinitely easier, since it contains only empty abstractions, only ultimate generic terms like awareness, past, and nothing. In metaphysics one must give heed to the logical levels of the concepts involved. Similar distinctions apply to the question, does God act lovingly? Yes, the position is, necessarily He performs loving acts, appropriate to whatever world there is. What world and what acts are contingent; but that appropriate acts of love are performed is necessary. What then does God, out of love, do for the world? At least, he inspires it with a basic order (the laws of nature), and everlastingly cherishes the creaturely lives in their realized actuality. Is this all? Not if it would be inappropriate and contrary to perfect love to stop at this point. All I insist upon is that it could not be appropriate or expressive of love to deprive even the least creature of its due amount and kind of freedom. Love cannot be less than the wish to have others exist as genuine actualities, and in this philosophy this means, as partly self</page><page sequence="4">292 CHARLES HARTSHORNE deciding agents, whose fortunes depend, therefore, in part upon themselves and their neighbors. Professor Hartt, like countless others, is so little impressed by the human type of freedom that he thinks a single step downward would reach zero, no freedom at all. Has he never seen a dog make doggish decisions? I have heard a distinguished student of animal behavior give a vivid description of a parent fish making one. And how is it possible not to see the difference between freely deciding upon this little animal movement rather than that, and freely deciding whether to live in this human mode rather than that? If I use the word "freedom" to cover both, this has nothing whatsoever to do with the dignity or lack of it in the alternatives of action involved. I am using the word, not rhetorically or evocatively, but in cold literal prose to designate a range, as small as you please in some cases, only not zero, of really open possi bilities for an animal, or subanimal, individual. The dignity of man is not in his being the only creature confronting such a range, but in the extent and dimensions of the range. To decide how to use words, for instance, in complex significant grammatical patterns is so far beyond any other terrestrial animal that one could almost call the difference infinite. I seriously think that the gap between Hartt and myself here is that I have given a good part of a lifetime to this problem and he has given it a mental glance or two. Human freedom, as power to resolve causal indeterminacies, is not so close to zero that there is no room below us for more trivial kinds of such power. And indeed every infant must pass through some of the lower stages before reaching the rational or human level. Nor does it give single electrons any great dignity to say that their actions are not fully determined causally. It is determined that they cannot do anything very great! Incidentally, how intimately does a theologian know atoms or electrons, that he can make abso lute negative inferences about their nature? Even an expert is limited in his access to these rather mysterious entities. To make positive metaphysical (purely generic) statements about all con crete and singular entities, on the basis of categorial arguments, with atoms or particles as mere illustrations, is another matter. It is said to be hardly a motivation to strive for good rather than evil that our acts and their results will be ideally remembered.</page><page sequence="5">ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE IN GOD: A REPLY 293 Here too I think only a mental glance can have been given the ques tion. Look at the concern people show to be appreciated and remembered even in the imperfect human way ! And if one loves God, does one want to present him with evil to suffer (for I believe, with Berdyaev, Whitehead and others, in a suffering deity)? Or is Hartt saying that he at least cannot love God unless He has certain other properties than those specified? It seems this must be it. I would never say that God "enjoys but does not command" realities. He commands them in an ideally appropriate way; I hold only that this cannot include making their freedom a mere semblance. The sole "limitation" upon divine power is that it be genuine, and this means power over things which themselves are genuine, that is, also have some power. In the "refutation" on p. 759 I find some ambiguities, to say the least. If, it is urged, God proposes to change himself, this proposed result cannot be perfect or necessary, for then, by the Proof, it would already exist. Of course the proposed state can not be perfect in the absolute or static sense of "usurpassable, even by the being itself." And it also certainly cannot be necessary. But this is all quite consistent with my position. Divine states are contingent and surpassable, but this is compatible with God's being unsurpassable by another than himself. Unsurpassability, except by Himself, is the perfection I attribute to deity, and employ in the Ontological Argument. However, the states too are perfect in the appropriate sense: for instance, they involve perfect knowl edge of their de facto world. About that world there is nothing further left to know. The criterion governing God's transformation of himself can not, we are told, be at once perfect and merely abstract, or without concrete existence. Here too my distinctions are ignored. The criterion is perfect qua ideal, and also it has always existed in some concrete application, since no divine self-transformation is the first. That not all possible concrete applications are actual is because, as I explain, they are not compossible. An ideal calling for exhaustive concretization would be a false or absurd ideal, not a perfect one. Regarding the reviewer's question whether there are such things as possibilities: if other worlds were possible, that is, if God</page><page sequence="6">294 CHARLES HARTSHORNE was free to create differently and with different results, and if the creatures have had some slight freedom to do otherwise than they have done, then this is all the possibilities my position needs. I grant that a possible world is not an entity, comparable to an actual world; yet the freedom to do this or that, and to know this or that as actual if it is made actual, neither being antecedently or eternally determined, is enough to introduce contingency not only into the world but into God. Is God constituted by his response to the world? Not exclu sively, for he is also constituted by his responses to his own ante cedent responses. And no particular world was required, while for world in general his own power is sufficient guarantee. Are the cells the real agents in a person? Surely not, except in dreamless sleep. If one supposes otherwise, then a cell, by the same reasoning, would have as its real agents the molecules, and these the atoms, and so on. Rather, on every level, atom, cell, man, the most concrete agents are the "actual entities," the "expe rient occasions." I have never said that a person is merely an organism, in the normal biological meaning. Only in a gen eralized sense of "whole whose parts contribute value to it" is the psycho-physical person termed an organism. But even here "whole" means sequence of experient-occasions on the human level which, in a measure, sum up the events making up the subhuman parts. As for the "formal identity" of a growing purpose, why not, since each occasion can inherit this from its predecessor? Only, the purpose is relatively abstract, compared to the actual expe riences. As for memory, when a human individual has his first experience, there must either be no memory, or memory of a past in which that individual was not present. I hold that the latter is the reasonable view. Also that even perception is awareness of the past, but of the non-personal past. So I do not think it is correct to argue that awareness of the past requires prior presence of the remembering person. Inheritance from the past is not to be explained: it is the way in which causality is made intelligible, the real answer to Hume. Such inheritance is an aspect of creative synthesis, the principle which explains everything though nothing</page><page sequence="7">ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE IN GOD: A REPLY 295 explains it. We experience illustrations of the principle, we do not derive it from something else. I should probably be grateful to Professor Hartt for taking my book seriously and wrestling so earnestly with tenets rather un congenial to him. The University of Texas.</page></plain_text>
