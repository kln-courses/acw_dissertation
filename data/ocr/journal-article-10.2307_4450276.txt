<plain_text><page sequence="1">6 Biology Today Q Birdmen Maura C. Flannery Department Editor The title of this column might seem rather sexist. After all, there are many women who are ornithologists and even more who are amateur bird watchers, so why focus on the men? Quite simply, it's because I want to devote this column to two of my favor- ite writers about birds who just happen to be men: Lawrence Kilham and Alex- ander Skutch. I have read several books by each of these authors and have fallen in love with the way they mix hard evidence on bird behavior with admiration for the organisms they are studying. Since I plan to discuss primarily their work, I couldn't find a more appropriate- or succinct-title than "Birdmen." Lawrence Kilham On several occasions, I have men- tioned that I came to read a particular book because I happened to get it at a rock-bottom price. This may seem like a rather anti-intellectual way to choose reading material, but it has worked to my benefit on several occasions. I had seen Lawrence Kilham's book On Watching Birds (1988) advertised, but I had no real desire to buy it. I am not a bird watcher, and the title implied that this was a manual on how to pursue Maura C. Flannery is Associate Dean, and Professor of Biology and Chair of the Division of Computer Science, Mathematics and Science at St. John's University, Jamaica, NY 11439. She earned a B.S. in biology from Marymount Manhattan College, an M.S., also in biology, from Boston Col- lege and a Ph.D. in science educa- tion from New York University. Her ma- jor interest is in communicating science to the nonscientist. She has developed biology courses for crimi- nal justice majors and for communi- cations and journalism majors, as well as courses in reproductive biology and exercise physiology. this popular hobby. But when I found it on a remainder table priced at $1.50, I was willing to take a chance, espe- cially when I discovered it contained a chapter on one of my favorite topics, "Instinct for Beauty and Love of Ani- mals." Though On Watching Birds does con- tain some advice for those who wish to spend time observing animals, it turned out to be more a personal mem- oir of someone who might be called an amateur ornithologist rather than just a bird watcher. Kilham is a retired virol- ogist who developed a love of nature early in life. He went to Harvard as a zoology major, but turned to history and literature before going on to med- ical school. His interest in birds inten- sified when he married because his wife Jane, also a physician, is an avid bird watcher. After service in World War II, Kilham worked with John End- ers, who received the Nobel Prize for his research on growing the polio virus in culture. Kilham studied the mumps virus, moving on to the National Insti- tutes of Health in 1949 and eventually to Dartmouth in the 1960s, where he worked on the relationship between viruses and cancer. All this time, Kilham was also a serious bird watcher. He writes that early in his career he wondered if his interest in birds would cut into his interest in viruses, but he found that, I need not have worried. I enjoyed the freedom of my amateur approach to birds so much that I used the same approach when pursuing viruses (p. 115). He found that when things weren't going well in his viral research, his productivity in bird work went up and vice versa, so he always had some work to encourage him to keep going with both areas. In a 1964 article on Kilham in the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine, George O'Connell writes that over Kilham's desk is the maxim: leisure is the mother of discovery. For Kilham, this leisure involved him not only in virology and bird watching, but also in the history of medicine, particularly in the work of physician-naturalists. All these forms of leisure were very fruitful for Kilham. He lectured on the history of medicine to medical students, received a Re- search Career Award from Dartmouth for his viral work, and published nu- merous articles on bird behavior in ornithology journals. Wherever he was working- or vacationing- he and Jane took time to study birds. In Costa Rica, he found the heat difficult to take, but: I think these initial dJifculties made what we found later the more enjoyable. Adap- tation made the difference. Whereas at home walking makes mefeel better, at Palo Verde it made me feel worse. And, mira- bile dictu, the less I walked about, the more I saw (p. 62). On Sapelo, an island off the coast of Georgia, he studied pileated wood- peckers, and in Africa, he observed the behavior of white casqued hornbills near Entebbe. He writes that from the hornbills he learned that: I succeed best with opportunistic studies, topics thatfit in with the country where I am living and with work I am doing (p. 21). Perhaps it is because woodpeckers can be found in both the north and the south that they became the focus of many of Kilham's observations. He re- calls that these studies began in 1956 when he was walking near the Chesa- peake and Ohio Canal in Maryland wondering if he could find birds in the United States that would be as engross- ing as the hornbills had been in Africa. As he was considering this problem, he saw some blue jays trying to steal acorns from red-headed woodpeckers: Then an idea came to me. Why go farther? Why not study these birds? Keep with them, I said to myself, and something will turn up (p. 32). 180 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 59, NO. 3, MARCH 1997</page><page sequence="2">He kept with them even as he vaca- tioned in Florida and later moved to New Hampshire, so he was able to observe a variety of species. While at Dartmouth, he spent at least an hour a day observing woodpeckers and other species in a woodlot near his home. These observations led to the book, Woodpeckers of Eastern North America (1983), which is a thorough guide to several woodpecker species. Kilham's work on birds intensified when he retired from Dartmouth at the age of 70 in 1980. He then began exten- sive observations on crows and ravens, and in 1989 published The American Crow and the Common Raven. The book contains a wealth of information on these birds, but it is also a very per- sonal book which makes it much more than a monograph on bird behavior. For example, Kilham discusses his ex- periences with hand-raised ravens. He manages to convey his love for these creatures while also noting that he made significant observations on their behavior such as those on a raven he raised which had the rather unimagi- native name of Raveny: One of Raveny's steadier occupations was storingfood and objects. He tried to do so within a few weeks of fledgling, but had difculties finding suitable covering mate- rials.... The amount of efort he put into caching was related to how much he prized what he carried (p. 205). Like many other observers, Kilham notes the intelligence of crows. In his book, he tries to show that "crows think consciously and make decisions as part of their daily lives" (p. 169). Tail pulling is a common habit among crows. A crow can rob another by pulling its tail. Crows also work to- gether. In mobbing, a number of crows caw together as they pursue, surround, or face either other crows in territorial disputes or predators that are particu- larly threatening. Kilham is also one of the few to observe anting among American crows in the wild. In this behavior, a crow takes ants in its beak and rubs them into its skin. This rather odd behavior seems to be a way to control feather mites and soothe skin irritations. [I am reminded here of David Quammen, a good nature writer with a rather ironical tone, who has a tongue-in-cheek essay on anting in crows (1985). Quammen attributes this behavior to the crows' intelligence: they are easily bored and the stimula- tion they get from anting is somewhat akin to drug use in young people.] While Kilham's observations on birds are fascinating, what interests me most about his writing are the insights he gives into why he studies nature in the way he does and why he derives so much pleasure from it. I say "studies nature" rather than "studies birds" be- cause Kilham hardly limits himself to feathered creatures. He writes that: readers may wonder why, in a book on watching bird behavior, I occasionally give an account of watching some mammal. I feel that it does not pay to be too narrowly focused (1988, p. 27). It is because of this attitude that, while sitting in the field waiting for birds to appear, Kilham also takes careful notes on any other animals that might be around. To this practice we owe his interesting observations on beavers, pi- kas and crocodiles. As to advice on bird watching, Kil- ham recommends: Don't hurry. Sitting in one place and observing carefully leads to a deeper un- derstanding (1988, p. 24). He also writes about a problem with this approach: There is probably no greater barrier for most people to watching birds or animals, or to studying anything else, for that matter, than the idea of being alone (1988, p. 163). Because of his desire for solitude, Kil- ham and his wife often make their observations separately. This has the added benefit of giving them a great deal to tell each other at the end of the day. Kilham also argues that when you are studying nature, you are never re- ally alone because you experience a oneness with other life. At the close of his book, Kilham writes that what he likes about behav- ior-watching is that it "not only strengthens my bonds with the beauty of nature, but also my empathy with living things" (1988, p. 171). It is ulti- mately this empathy that comes through most clearly in Kilham's writ- ings and makes them so attractive. It is also empathy that makes Kilham such a good observer of behavior; he identi- fies with his subjects so closely that he is able to glean a great deal from his observations. Alexander Skutch Empathy with his subjects is also a hallmark of Alexander Skutch's work. I first encountered Skutch through an article he wrote called "Miniatures and Giants" (1983a). It was about the influ- ence of size on biological form and function. There I found some novel ideas on the problems of very large and very small animals. I next read Skutch's book, Lfe Ascending (1985) in which he discusses evolution from the point of view of increasing sensitivity of the senses. But it was when I read his Nature through Tropical Windows (1983b) that I decided I wanted to write about Skutch. In it, he describes what he can observe from his home in a forest clearing in Costa Rica. I particu- larly liked the chapters on the exploits, over a number of years, of a family of house wrens. Skutch received a doctorate in bot- any from Johns Hopkins University in 1928. He then went to Panama on a fellowship for botanical research, and while there, became fascinated with the birds of the area: Looking into the subject after my return to well-stocked libraries, I learned that the birds of Central America had been so thor- oughly collected and described that the probability of finding new species was remote but that very little was known about the lives of these beautiful creatures (p. 3). So, like Kilham, Skutch became a stu- dent of bird behavior. As his interests shifted from botany to ornithology, the Depression made it difficult to get re- search support. While museums were willing to spend money on bird speci- mens, Skutch found killing birds for this purpose distasteful, so he sold col- lections of plant specimens instead, and used his spare time to study birds (Skutch 1971). Eventually, he bought a ranch in Costa Rica and with the money he makes there and through grants, he has spent his life studying the birds of Central and South Amer- ica. Skutch's (1983c) Birds of Tropical America is a great resource; it is filled with information on a large variety of bird species. The emphasis is on behav- ior, particularly mating behavior, but also foraging and care of young. For example, Skutch was the first to de- scribe the way some birds, particularly young adults, will assist parents with the care of nestlings. A more personal view of tropical birds and of how Skutch came to know them is given in A Bird Watcher's Adventures in Tropical America (1977) and in A Naturalist Amid Tropical Splendor (1987). Skutch writes of the difficulty of travel in forest areas in South America and of the friends he made in remote regions, but most of all, he writes of birds and of the thrill of making discoveries under such trying conditions. Skutch is now in his 90s and is still producing interesting books. He must have a huge mine of information about the birds he has observed over the BIOLOGY TODAY 181</page><page sequence="3">years, and he continues to draw on that treasure trove in interesting ways. In 1989, he published Birds Asleep in which he writes that: studying how birds sleep may not be as exciting as watching them in full daylight .... But to know how they pass the more obscure half of their lives is necessary to round out our picture of their habits. This knowledge brings a sense of intimacy that is deeply satisfying (p. xi). Since birds are much less obvious while sleeping, it could only be some- one with the wealth of information Skutch has accumulated who could write such a book. In it, Skutch de- scribes many behaviors including how birds conserve energy on cold nights; wrens, for example, huddle together in large groups and many birds in the high Andes sleep in rock crevices. The environment in which birds live is ob- viously related to bedroom choice; the blue-throated green motmot of Central America sleeps in burrows in roadside banks and in the steep, bare slopes of washouts, while sanderlings and other sandpipers often sleep on the beach balancing on one leg. In his most recent book, Skutch fo- cuses on a topic which is dealt with at least tangentially by anyone studying bird behavior, and that is The Minds Of Birds (1996). In the Preface, Skutch ad- mits that "I am far less certain of what goes on inside their heads than of what they do visibly" (p. xv). But with over 70 years of experience in observing bird behavior, Skutch is ready to set down his thoughts on what kinds of thinking birds are capable of engaging in. He realizes that he can be accused of anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to animals, but he notes that: when we recognize that we can hardly imagine any psychic state that we do not from time to time experience ourselves, the rigid avoidance of anthropomorphism might exclude the possibility of attributing to nonhuman animals any psychic life at all (p. xvi). Skutch sees most bird behavior as innate, such as the woodpecker finch's use of a cactus thorn to poke into crevices in search of insects. This be- havior "is an example of crystallized intelligence-a habit born of an innova- tive mind that no longer requires such a mind for its exercise" (p. 112). At the end of the book, Skutch writes that: the more profoundly and sympathetically we study birds, the stronger grows our intuition that they are conscious, until it becomes almost a certainty, and the less remote from us they appear (p. 164). In other words, as we get to know them, there is a meeting of the minds, which makes it possible for the human mind to appreciate the bird mind. This only occurs when birds are studied "profoundly," in the fashion of Kilham and Skutch, where enough time and solitude are allowed for such commun- ion to occur. Another theme that has grown stron- ger in Skutch's later work is the impor- tance of beauty to living things. This theme was discussed in Lfe Ascending, but it is the major focus of The Origin of Nature's Beauty (1992). Skutch argues that an appreciation of beauty has an adaptive advantage. If animals were not attracted to the beauty in nature, they might be less able to withstand hardships: If the azure of the sky and the verdure of the terrain were as depressing to an animal as certain drab colors can be to us, its vital processes and its will to live might be adversely afected, so that in the struggle for existence it would be less successful than some related animal who, instead of being depressed, was pleasantly excited by these widespread colors (Skutch, 1985, p. 147). Of course, there are also other adaptive advantages in which beauty can be seen as more than just a pleasant side benefit: Much beauty in nature would never have arisen in the absence of animals with vi- sion. Even certain of the means whereby animals escape their enemies-concealing and warning coloration-have contributed to nature's beauty. To the mutually bene- ficial interactions of plants with the polli- nators of their flowers and dispersers of their seeds we owe much of the loveliness of vegetation. The colors and adornments of many of the most beautiful animals, above all birds, have been promoted by preferen- tial mating (p. xv). But Skutch doesn't just dwell on vi- sual beauty. It is not surprising that as an observer of birds, he also discusses the beauty of bird song, relying heavily on the work of another birdman, Charles Hartshome. Hartshorne was a philosopher by profession, and like Kilham, was an amateur ornithologist. His Born to Sing (1973) is an extensive analysis of bird song, including infor- mation on the uses of song, the differ- ent types of songs, and the different singing abilities of various species. Skutch argues that: no one has presented better reasons for believing that birds have aesthetic feeling, that the songs of many are music, and that they enjoy singing than Charles Hart- shorne (p. 260). Being a philosopher, Hartshome is interested in analysis, in breaking a phenomenon down into its component parts, and this is what he does with bird song. Skutch approvingly cites the method Hartshorne developed for the "objective assessment of bird song" (p. 232). The six criteria of song quality are loudness; complexity; absence of inter- ruptions; tone; organization, including rhythm, melody, and theme and varia- tions; and imitativeness, the ability to reproduce the songs of others. This may seem like analyzing a beautiful phenomenon to death, but Hart- shome's point is that with these crite- ria, the different singing abilities of birds can be classified. For Skutch, the fact that some birds are much more accomplished singers than others indi- cates that, like other traits, this one is more highly evolved in some species than in others. Other Birdmen While I've focused on Kilham and Skutch, there are many other birdmen who have also written good books on the subject. There are really a great number of these, so I'll just mention the ones I've come across and particularly enjoyed. An old one is The Charm of Birds. I was attracted to it because its author's name is Viscount Grey of Fal- lodon (1927). He comes from a tradi- tion very different from that of Kilham and Skutch. A member of the British nobility, Grey describes the birds on his estate and his experiences both ob- serving and hunting birds. He writes of when he was first a member of Parlia- ment in the 1890s and was forced to spend a great deal of time in London, away from his land and his birds. He became friendly with the man who took care of the waterfowl in St. James Park and visited him often "to hear news of the breeding waterfowl and to be shown various nests" (p. 182). An- other birdman with political interests is Louis Halle, who wrote on the interna- tional political scene, but like Kilham, found that an interest in birds added to, rather than detracted from, his career interests. Since he traveled widely, Halle was able to observe birds in such widely different regions as India and the Alps. Jake Page (1993), on the other hand, sticks closer to home and writes pri- marily of the birds he has seen near his home in the Washington, D.C. area. I bought this book because I opened to a page with the line, "Terns have always made me feel good" (p. 39). The book is filled with such observations and with a great deal of information Page has 182 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 59, NO. 3, MARCH 1997</page><page sequence="4">gleaned from a variety of sources. An- other writer on birds of the eastern United States is Pete Dunne who works at the Audubon Society's Cape May Bird Observatory in New Jersey. Dunne's (1986) Tales of a Low-Rent Birder is less reverential than those of most of the other writers I've cited. Since Dunne is a professional, it is not surprising that he is more involved with the process of birding and the people who do it. He writes of a birda- thon, a weekend event when bird watchers compete to identify the most birds. Dunne presents a very different view of birding, one that is much more communal than that of the other authors. Though Kilham and Skutch find bird watching en masse distasteful, it is im- portant to remember that for many people it is the comradery of this pas- time which makes it so attractive. This is clearly the case for George Levine (1995) whose essays in Lfebirds inter- weave thoughts on birds with thoughts on his relationships with the people who watch birds with him. For Levine, birding definitely has a social function; he deepens his relationships with peo- ple by sharing the experience of bird watching with them. Levine is an En- glish professor and the author of Dar- win and the Novelists (1988), but LWebirds is not a work of science. While I didn't learn much about birds from this book, I found it very emotionally satisfying, and more than any other book I've read, it made me want to get out and do some bird watching myself. Another of my favorite bird books is My Way in Ornithology by Olin Sewall Pettingill, Jr. (1992). Like Kilham, Pet- tingill developed an interest in nature early in life, spending the summers on his grandparent's farm. He went on to major in ornithology at Cornell Univer- sity, and the book recounts his years as an undergraduate and then as a doc- toral student there. Like Skutch, Pettin- gill finished his schooling during the Depression, and spent several years on various jobs and research projects which took him from Virginia to Can- ada. The book ends with Pettingill be- ginning his first academic appointment as a professor of ornithology at Carle- ton College in Minnesota. Like Skutch and Kilham, Pettingill weaves together his life experiences with information on birds. I think this is what I find so attractive about their work. They are able to convey some- thing of the emotional experience of bird watching, and I think that they are all very good at what they do because of this emotional commitment rather than in spite of it. Science is often portrayed as an endeavor in which feelings play little role because feelings can blind the scientist and ruin objec- tivity. While this is all true, it is only half the picture. A project will be suc- cessful only when a scientist is totally committed to it. How could these bird- men sit for untold hours in hot, humid forests or cold, wet swamps unless they were totally involved in this work both intellectually and emotionally. What also marks the work of Kilham and Skutch is their emphasis on the individual; they are both experts at recording individual observations. Sometimes a particular behavior, once noted, is seen again and again, but some remain unique sightings. Yet these are worth mentioning too. They give a more complete picture of a spe- cies' range of behavior and make the narrative more fascinating. In each of their books, Kilham and Skutch give hundreds of facts like these, but what prevents these books from becoming mere catalogs is the way these facts are woven into stories about the birds, and about the birdmen who watch them.
