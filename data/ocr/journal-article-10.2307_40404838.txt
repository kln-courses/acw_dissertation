Such an interpretation, to be credible, would need to be grounded in a ma- terialist account of religion's origins and power. Marx and Engels, before calling for proletarian revolution and long before Volume I of Capital, specified that criticism of religion must precede all criticism. Yet neither they (nor later Marxists) developed a clear definition, nor spelled out the assumed relationship between dis- belief and working-class liberation. Since - throughout the so- called Era of Secularism (roughly, from the Enlightenment to World War II) - working classes have tended to be more religious than middle classes, the "problem" of religion remained an ob- stacle to Marxian politics. Thus the failure of the Marxist critique not only left this problem unresolved, but, more importantly, left secularism itself intellectually disarmed against the resurgence of religious belief that followed the Second World War. CULTURE AND POLITICS through the late 19th and first half of the 20th centuries provided the cutting edge for the anti-religious heritage of the Enlightenment. When Marx chose for his doctoral thesis a comparison of two classical ma- * An earlier version of this essay was presented in October 2003 as a discussion paper at the Labor History Seminar directed by Professor Marcus Rediker at the University of Pitts- burgh.

And lest there be any doubt as to his views on religion, he included in his foreword (1841) a romantic in- vocation of Prometheus: Philosophy makes no secret of it. Prometheus' admission: "In sooth all gods I hate" [Aeschylus, Prometheus Unbound] is its own admission, its own motto against all gods, heavenly and earthly, who do not acknowledge the con- sciousness of man as the supreme deity. . . . Prometheus is the noblest of saints and martyrs in the calendar of philosophy. (ME, 1964, 13-4.) Three years later, in a critical essay on Hegel, Marx wrote that criti- cism of religion "is the premise of all criticism," and went on to char- acterize religion as "the opium of the people"(41-2). All this was 20 years before the first volume of Das Kapital in 1867 and four years before Marx and Friedrich Engels, now partners, issued their famous challenge in the Communist Manifesto: "The proletarians have noth- ing to lose but their chains. . . . Workingmen of all countries, unite!" (ME, 1998, 77). These quotations and titles are well known; what I need to stress is their chronology. Criticism of religion preceded both the call for proletarian revolt and the analysis of industrial capital- ism. The order of priority conveyed a sense that socialist theory as developed by Marx and Engels began from, and remained deeply grounded in, the rejection of religion. If such were the case, one would expect to find religion clearly defined and its negation centrally located within the dialectic of class conflict. That indeed has been a widely held assumption, but almost certainly mistaken. The fact is that religion is nowhere clearly de- fined in Marxian writings, nor is the relation between disbelief and working-class revolution fully spelled out. Religion is generally linked negatively to ideology, the latter understood as false consciousness promoted by the ruling class (Seliger, 1977, 30-1, notes 20, 21); but whether religion simply forms part of ideology, or necessarily existed prior to it, remains unexplained. This lack of precision in theorizing religion - as I will argue in what follows - hampered Marxian prac- tical politics throughout the 19th and 20th centuries; and, at longer range, undercut the dominant secularism of the modern era, thus leaving the way open for the resurgence of religious belief following the Second World War.</page><page sequence="3">310 SCIENCE à? SOCIETY 1. From Feuerbach to the Manifesto Marx and Engels tell us that their break from Hegelian idealism (and presumably from religion as well) was inspired by Ludwig Feuer- bach's Essence of Christianity (1841). Feuerbach had proposed a ma- terialist account of religion: humans in primeval times imagined gods in their own image, then projected and worshipped those same gods; as they came gradually to realize the gods were reflections of them- selves, so they would gradually recognize the divine essence of their humanity. Marx and Engels adopted a similar but no less ambigu- ous formulation. Prometheus in Marx's doctoral thesis appears pro- foundly Feuerbachian, as does the fuzziness of the boundary drawn there between human and divine.1 Well versed though he was in Greek mythology - knowing that Prometheus, born of gods and titans, had to be a god - Marx nonetheless assigned him human status: "noblest of saints and martyrs in the calendar of philosophy." Was Marx speaking directly or metaphorically? If divinity is a property of the human species must it not also be inherent in the cosmos? Had Feuerbach simply substituted a Spinozean pantheism for Christianity's orthodox theism? (Israel, 2001, 159-74). And Marx and Engels con- curred in this? They soon distanced themselves from Feuerbach, yet they would not hesitate to impose on proletarians the god-like tasks of Prometheus. Despite these ambivalences of concept and definition, Marx and Engels themselves remained non-believers and foes of institutional religion. This heritage from the Left Enlightenment they powerfully impressed on their followers, thus helping to insure that Marxism through the next century and a half would serve as a prime target for religion's multitudinous defenders. At the same time - more than any other 19th-century tendency of radical anti-capitalism - Marx- ism remained open to labor unionism and working-class politics. Marxian activists proved influential leaders in both these enterprises. It may not be irrelevant, therefore, to ask how successful they were in pursuing the party line on religion, and whether it proved an asset 1 As accurately rendering this "fuzziness," I quote a comment by Richard Lichtman at a symposium on "Marxism and Christianity" organized by Herbert Aptheker in 1968: "Feuer- bach's 'reduction' of religion . . . must not be misunderstood. . . . The process is one of exaltation for the intention is not to lower God and religion to mere anthropology, but to raise man to the level of the divine" (Aptheker, 1968, 75). For reference to varying con- cepts of religion held by Marx and Engels, see note 4, below.</page><page sequence="4">MARXISM AND RELIGION 31 1 or a hindrance in organizing workers; nor to inquire why Marx and Engels chose to make criticism of religion the "premise" for their project in revolutionary political economy. Obviously my purposes in this essay are global, although the degree to which I can fill them out remains modest. At most, I can sketch contours of the questions just posed (which for me at least are new ones), and suggest tentative answers. I will begin with the last question first. An appraisal of how Marx and Engels positioned them- selves with respect to religion at the middle of the 19th century, and why they took the stance they did, points more or less logically to an examination of how that stance worked out later for their followers. The research required for such an examination on any national - let alone global - scale is immense. Some of it has already been done. In the U. S. field, however, which provides boundaries for most of my presentation, if much has been done I have not yet encountered it. Consequently, I will be speaking tentatively (some might say eva- sively) in the middle portions: that is, I will move as quickly as pos- sible to the 20th century and talk more about personal experiences in the labor movement than about archival discoveries. Finally, we need to ask - and this will bring me to the concluding section - why pursue such questions at all? For me, as for most of my academic colleagues within 15 years or so of my age, "god talk" - talk about religion - seemed both useless and distasteful. Had we not been raised during the Era of Secularism? What has religion to do with the history of modern times? We were forgetting that the so-called Era of Secularism itself has a history that began with the Enlightenment and ended just after the Second World War.2 Since then it has been in self- destructing mode. To bring us into our own post-secular era, let me quote a contemporary scholar of religion who recently edited an an- thology bearing the title, Marx on Religion. "In the twenty-first century," he writes, "religion promises to be a major historical force for the first time in four hundred years. ... In this new century the values Marx fought for . . . may find their most effective advocate in world religions." While the first part of this statement seems directly accurate, the last part I think remains dubious (Raines, 2002, 12-13). 2 There is an immense literature on secularism and religious revival. For present purposes reference to Matthew Arnold's "Dover Beach" (1867) and Newman's Apologia pro Vita Sua (1947, 123, 181, 221-2, 236); then Shapley, 1960; Cox, 1965; McLoughlin and Bellah, 1968; Cox, 1995 will be sufficient.</page><page sequence="5">3 1 2 SCIENCE äf SOCIETY Now: to Marx, Engels and the line on religion. We need to note that their careers fall within the opening cen- tury of the Era of Secularism. Non-belief, for the first time in more than fifteen hundredyears, was becoming intellectually - even to some extent socially - tolerable. Orthodox religionists, Protestant or Catho- lic, still controlled most major institutions such as city and state gov- ernments and universities throughout Western Europe, yet faced increasingly articulate resistance from educated opponents among the upper classes. Thus, for example, when John Stuart Mill in En- gland declared that the "whole of the prevalent metaphysics of the present century" comprises a "tissue of suborned evidence in favor of religion" (Mill, 1969, 72), he was saying approximately what Marx and Engels were saying, and targeting the same German idealist meta- physics they were rebelling against. While for Mill the main enemy was Kant, it was of course Hegel for Marx and Engels. Different though the systems of these philosophers were, it would not be inaccurate to describe both as idealist constructions designed to protect religion. Protect it against what? Against the oncoming Era of Secularism: against the rise of skeptical rationalism; against cumulative disillusion- ments attached to the memory of religious wars that had raged across Europe for almost 200 years; against the encroachments of empiri- cal science into orthodox belief. Marx and Engels in all these con- troversial areas stood on solid ground to the extent that their peers in class status and education were likely to remain tolerant toward criticisms of religion which many of them already shared (Carver, 1989, 1-59). Yet no such immunity would attach to radical criticisms of class hierarchy. The Hegelian dialectic in a broad sense had idealized the cosmos as ongoing spiritual process. More narrowly, that portion of it paralleling human history could be analogized to Christian doc- trine. God's decision to create a world populated by creatures (in- cluding humans) established the antithesis. Conflict stemmed from the willed act of human creatures to use their God-given liberty for rebellion against the Creator. Resolution, after many turns of the dialectic, must await the advent of Christ, begotten out of mortal flesh by divine spirit, and thus providing the synthesis within which the opposites - mortal and divine, Creator and created - will at last be rejoined. According to the famous legend, Marx had arrived at his class interpretation of human history by an intellectual tour deforce,</page><page sequence="6">MARXISM AND RELIGION 313 that is by translating Hegel's idealist dialectic into a materialist one. Instead of pushing the narrative through a progression of metaphysi- cal abstractions, the dialectic would now be made to convey human class struggles in the language of historical realism. A full-dress presentation of the materialist dialectic occurs in the Communist Manifesto (1848). There are some baffling conceptual problems about this transformation, of which I will mention (at this point) only one. If history comprises a series of struggles in which exploited (therefore antithetical) classes overpower one another to establish each in turn its own dominance, there would seem no pos- sible escape from this repetition unless a class formation occurred which somehow had the power (or lack of power!) to break out of the cycle. Recalling the original model - that is, the Hegelian dia- lectic that symbolically enacted the Christian story - it is obvious the crucial role belonged to Christ, who by his sacrificial death terminates the long chain of contradictions between creator and created. Yet when this idealist dialectic is turned upside down and all the actors become "real, active men, as they are conditioned by a definite de- velopment of their productive forces," what sort of class formation could be expected to play a comparable role? (ME, 1970, 47). "The idea - fundamental for Marx from then on - " writes the Marxian historian, Eric Hobsbawm, "that the proletariat was a class which could not liberate itself without thereby liberating society as a whole, first appears as 'a philosophical deduction rather than a product of ob- servation'. . . . 'the proletariat makes its first appearance in Marx' writings as the social force needed to realize the aims of German philosophy . . .'" Needed, that is, to materialize the idealized figure of Prometheus (Hobsbawm, 1998, 22-3). 2. Prometheans to Proletarians Did Hobsbawm say deduction? He did. Marx and Engels always insisted on their socialist theory as scientific rather than Christian or Utopian. Science, however (at least as understood in the 19th cen- tury) , rests not on deduction from alleged universais, but inductions from empirical observation. Engels, in The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845), had provided an empirical and shattering portrayal of the beginnings of capitalist manufacturing. His work undoubtedly contributed to the predictive accuracy of Capital, on</page><page sequence="7">314 SCIENCE &amp; SOCIETY which the two authors later collaborated; yet it hardly offers much evidence for the Promethean (or Christ-like) role assigned to prole- tarians in The Communist Manifesto. A horde of ragged women and children swarm about here, as filthy as the swine that thrive upon the garbage heaps. . . . The race that lives in these ruinous cottages . . . must really have reached the lowest stage of humanity. . . . The neglect to which the great mass of workingmen's children are con- demned . . . brings the enfeeblement of the whole race. . . . Liquor is almost their only source of pleasure. ... As inevitably as a great number of working men fall prey to drink, just so inevitably does it manifest its ruinous influ- ence upon the body and mind of its victims. (Engels, 1987, 98, 132-3.) How could a "race" so reduced in vital energy and self-esteem find courage to break free from religious superstition and raise the banner of revolt? Engels, no less an enthusiast than Marx, did his best to discover empirical answers to this question. "Faulty education," he speculated, "saves [the new proletarian] from religious prepossessions, he ... knows nothing of the fanaticism that holds the bourgeoisie bound . . ." (151). For Engels, raised in a hardshell Calvinist milieu (Carver, 1989, 1-30), any estrangement from religion, even if arrived at by default, was a positive factor; and he found hope also in the first flickerings of class consciousness. "The English workingman who can scarcely read and still less write, nevertheless knows very well where his own interest and that of the nation lies" (Engels, 1987, 141). "They begin to perceive that, though feeble as individuals, they form a power united. . . . The consciousness of oppression awakens . . . the workers attain social and political importance" (148). Entries such as these re- main few in number, cautious and tentative in tone, whereas the over- whelming thrust of Engels' book is on despair and degradation - disease, malnutrition, wretchedness of the workers, suffering and death of their women and children. Yet only three years later, when these same proletarians reappear in the Communist Manifesto, they have taken a new lease on life. A key passage describing their "condition" - and announcing their historic mission - runs as follows: . . . modern industrial labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him [the proletarian] of every trace of national character. Law, morality, religion, are</page><page sequence="8">MARXISM AND RELIGION 3 1 5 to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests. . . . All previous historical movements were move- ments of minorities. . . . The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present so- ciety . . . cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air. (ME, 1998, 48-9.) What a contrast! The industrial worker, reborn, transcends not only bourgeois nationalism, but bourgeois law, morality, religion as well; and not by default but as a result of purposeful thought. Decon- structing the mysteries of ideology, the proletarian energizes "the immense majority" of humankind (there is no empirical evidence whatever in Engels' book to support this assertion), whose fate now rests on the integrity of working-class consciousness. Here is a trans- formation comparable to the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and we need to understand they share some of the same ingredients. The new proletarian rises up as culture hero for the workers of the world, revealing to them the "self-evident truths" of their condition, which - like the axioms of Euclidean geometry on which they are modeled - compel total acceptance and actions that accord therewith (Engels, 1987, 50, 65). Yet I think it can be shown (as I will try to do in the next section) that many of the difficulties Marx and Engels encountered - difficulties endemic to working-class politics throughout the next century and a half - stem from this mismatch between the idealized proletarian and a Marxian commit- ment to stand at an empirical level with the real world. 3. Dialectics of the Welfare State Two mistakes of Marx and Engels in the 1840s were their antici- pation of immediate revolution and their belief that proletarians must necessarily reject religion (64, 151, 243). On both points, Engels had pushed beyond what his observations of English working-class life could sustain, and Marx went along with this. Together, they developed a historical argument building upward from peasant revolts in the 17th century, through the great revolutions of the 18th and Chartism in the 19th - all securely anchored within real (empirical) history - then, however, leaping to an imagined future insurrection led by England's</page><page sequence="9">3 1 6 SCIENCE &amp; SOCIETY proletarians which would engulf the nations of the world (ME, 1970, 66-88). Revolution, Engels wrote in 1845, soon "must break out . . . in comparison with which the French Revolution . . . will prove to have been child's play" (Engels, 1987, 64). Then came the revolutions of 1848, which they supported (Engels in military action in the Rhine- land); but viewed as bourgeois and constitutionalist (Carver, 1989, 80, 86) - merely preliminary to the proletarian insurrection they were predicting (Kiernan, 1987, 22). Many years later, blaming him- self for their failed prophecy, Engels ascribed it to "youthful ardor" (Engels, 1987, 38, 46). I am concerned here with Marxism itself, not with apportioning credits and demerits between its founders. I sup- pose Marx to have been no less youthfully ardent than Engels; they were barely two years apart in age; both were gripped by expectations that perhaps led them to transcend - or at least go beyond - what the empirical evidence warranted. Moreover, especially with respect to religion, they were hampered by misperceptions inherent in their class background. Secularism, as I noted earlier, had, by the early 19th century, become tolerable in educated middle-class circles. But this was not the case for lower-class cultures. Engels acknowledged that most of what he knew about re- ligion in the mill towns came from reports of parliamentary and governmental committees (Engels, 1987, 128, 157-8). Conservatives were Anglican, Liberals likely to be Unitarian; each had their own agendas to push. Both would be suspicious of Methodist chapels and hostile to radical sectaries such as those described by E. P. Thomp- son (1993), or (for an earlier period) Christopher Hill (1975). The mills already were recruiting Irish immigrants (Engels, 1987, 123- 6) ; some doubtless brought their Catholic faith, which to Anglicans as well as Unitarians would seem worse than none at all. I suspect that Engels, with respect to religion, missed a good deal of what was going on around him in Manchester and Birmingham. In part, then, due to their incarnation of Prometheus, Marx and Engels were mistaken both in their prediction of revolution and their belief that industrial workers would reject religion. The latter seemed crucial, at least during the 1840s, because they believed loss of reli- gion necessary for that total alienation from bourgeois values which they expected would launch the proletarians into revolutionary orbit. It was non-occurrence of this revolution that established the politi- cal landscape within which Marxism and religious faith pursued their</page><page sequence="10">MARXISM AND RELIGION 317 complex relationships throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the political economy of that landscape has already been thor- oughly mapped, I will simply note some of its main features and set them aside for reference. Industrial capitalism burgeoned in West- ern Europe and North America. So also did the industrial working class. Because industrialists required some degree of willing coopera- tion from their work force, a symbiotic relationship which we now call welfare-state capitalism developed between the two. Welfare-state capi- talism spread rapidly in Europe, slowly and painfully in the United States. Its logic pointed to working-class partnership: subjects would be called citizens and granted benefits that raised them (presumably) above the level that prevailed outside their national boundaries. Grudg- ingly, the old-style craft unions made room for new "non-skilled" in- dustrial workers; rapidly in Europe, slowly and painfully in the United States. In Europe, labor parties proliferated, many with socialist pro- grams; in the United States, where universal (male) suffrage had pre- ceded industrialization, workers took part as voters (seldom as leaders) in the two-party system. The keystone of welfare-state capitalism was industrial growth. The bigger the pie, the larger its individual slices. Growth made possible maintenance - sometimes even improvement - of working-class liv- ing standards without requiring changes in the hierarchical structure of society. Thus it mitigated class conflict and provided a buffer against revolution. Welfare states faced outward. Both sides (capital and labor) strove to upgrade the enterprise at the expense of other nations, in- cluding similarly structured welfare states. We know by hindsight that world war would be the eventual outcome, but such grim scenarios were not yet readily visible during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Labor radicalism, inside each welfare state, shorn of revolution, produced a pseudo-middle class of trade union officials and social democratic politicians who served their constituents as spokesmen and mediators. Continuing across successive life spans, these circumstances generated a class consciousness that was unique to the labor force of industrial capitalism. Although Marx and Engels could hardly have perceived it as totally emancipatory, it proved protective and serviceable within national boundaries, so long as economic growth continued more or less uninterrupted. That of course was a big "if." Outwardly functioning as partnerships, welfare states worked inwardly as controlled arenas of class conflict. Although the conflict</page><page sequence="11">3 1 8 SCIENCE äf SOCIETY was basically that of labor against capital, both sides (labor especially) remained internally divided. A Weberian image of this apparatus would look like a seesaw with the socialist workers at one end and religious workers on the other. The capitalist-controlled government in the middle gives occasional nudges this way or that for fine tun- ing. We are now deep into the Era of Secularism, which as we know penetrated working classes less than other levels of society. Although details obviously differ from nation to nation and time to time, the seesaw image remains approximately on target, I think, for welfare states throughout the western world. The social relationships it por- trays entail several important corollaries. Marxian labor activists, whatever their own class origins, will necessarily pursue their activi- ties in working-class communities that are likely to be more religious than the norm for the society at large. Vulnerable to accusations of teaching disbelief and corrupting Christian morality, they will be hampered in defending themselves since they are known already as members of a movement, or party, that denies religion. Their logi- cal counter-move will be a class-solidarity appeal charging religion (or whatever branch of religion dominates the community) with betraying the workers by supporting their employers. Such indict- ments, containing enough empirical reality to make them persuasive, nonetheless introduced subtle shifts in the original Marxist stance on religion - shifts, that is, from critiques of religion itself to forms of anticlericalism that sometimes seemed more concerned with purify- ing religion than criticizing it. 4. In the Vanguard of the Working Class I argued earlier that the Marxian concept of the proletariat was partly religious in origin, since the Prometheus by which it was in- spired anticipates the sublimated Christ of Hegel's dialectic, as re- converted by Feuerbach into "human beings . . . products of nature" (ME, 1964, 224). The notion of an elite, destined by its knowledge and courage to save the remainder of the tribe, or community, or species- at-large from its own cowardice and ignorance, is hardly a new idea, and historical examples are by no means only religious. Dispensing esoteric, saving knowledge has always proved a source of power and public esteem (Pagels, 1981, 168, 176). If proletarians, by letting slip the revolutionary moment, showed themselves less than Promethean,</page><page sequence="12">MARXISM AND RELIGION 3 1 9 members of the various Marxist parties that came afterwards were not averse to assuming that role. It was, I think, Lukács who coined the term "imputed consciousness" (Lukács, 1971, xviii-xix, 51-2, 344- 5) , to express what working-class persons would be thinking and doing if they thought and did as their (more advanced) Marxist fellow workers admonished them (Seliger, 1977, 58-9, 61, 86, 91). Work- ers of course had to have been created equal in the Enlightenment sense, yet divergent levels of discipline and theoretical perspective did develop among them. So while the party's rank and file carried the consciousness-raising burden with respect to fellow workers outside the party, cadres of presumably more experienced leaders pursued comparable tasks inside. This division of labor generated conflict. Local activists pushing short-term issues collided with national leaders trying to preserve or reformulate long-range socialist objectives. One side charged the other with having forgotten the realities of working-class life; the other responded with accusations of "economism" and "vul- gar Marxism." Neither could prevail, since their real problems re- mained insoluble. The epithet "vulgar" especially conveyed an elitism that often attached to party leadership. It signaled insensitivity to actual condi- tions under which real people lived (and died) . Moreover - and here I think we get to the heart of the matter - it made differences be- tween so-called "pure" and "vulgar" tendencies seem like factional divisions, whereas actually they were more like alternating percep- tions of reality inside the same individuals as they faced the ongoing routines of industrial labor and party organization. Once the revolu- tion failed to happen, there had to exist in every Marxian conscious- ness an agonizing perception that the more effectively one coped with day-to-day needs of keeping oneself and one's comrades alive, the longer would be postponed any final reckoning with capitalist exploi- tation. This might be described as the dialectic of welfare capitalism. The welfare state, for its Marxist inmates, came to be like something out of Dante's Purgatory. I sometimes imagined Lenin organizing a revolution in Purgatory, or - to call up B. Traven 's famous title - serving as political commis- sar for the Rebellion of the Hanged. Confronting a world already more appalling than that of Marx and Engels, Lenin attempted what may have been the final effort to checkmate industrial capitalism by ratcheting up Promethean styles of organization. Thus the subliminal</page><page sequence="13">320 SCIENCE äf SOCIETY religious connections of the Promethean metaphor merged into, and reinforced, the practical necessities of radical party building in the 20th century. When I joined the Communist Party in Chicago in the early 1940s I remember experiencing a warm glow of pride at having assumed my responsibility in the "vanguard of the working class." And I remember hearing an American Communist of German descent who had visited the homeland during the Weimar regime, describe the revolutionariness of German working-class radicals: "Yes! We are for the revolution! We prepare for it! We educate our children for it! But just don't let the Revolution happen on Sunday. Sunday is our day with the children to the seashore, the mountains, the sports park, music ..." Spoken ironically but with bitterness (Hitler was then at the height of his power) , the speech conveyed an elitist rebuke by suggesting that real proletarians would have been out preparing their political (and physical) defenses - as no doubt many of them actu- ally were. Yet after waiting a hundred years for the Revolution, when does it come time for a day in the park? Members of Marxist parties were likely to be ambivalent about the leadership roles I have been char- acterizing as Promethean, or Leninist. These have indeed unleashed world-shattering heroes of modern times. I need mention only two to more than make my point: Eugene Debs, Che Guevara. I could cite half a dozen others, far less famous, from personal knowledge. Such people indeed were (and are) Promethean; although I think this ought to be attributed more to their consciousness of themselves as humans than as heroes of a gnostic vanguard. Yet the same style of organization, in other circumstances, proved elitist, abrasive, divisive, self-serving. It contributed to failures of social democratic parties and the disasters of the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc nations. I referred to it earlier in a context of irony, but that is too gentle. The style is destructive, paradoxical, paralyzing. Its paradox is that it claims divine, or transcendental, sanction for propositions that are (merely!) human inductions from empirical observation. Well, yes: Marx and Engels did know Prometheus was a god, but that was back yonder in Greek mythology. What they wanted for their own times was a myth about human beings who became gods by discovering for themselves how to make fire; and do science (ME, 1970, 47). So, yes: they were hoping to use the certainty of an abstract idea-system (scientific laws?) to underwrite the vast uncertainties of</page><page sequence="14">MARXISM AND RELIGION 321 class struggle and socialist revolution. Engels in later years began gathering material for what was to have been a major work titled Dialectics of Nature (Haldane, 1940, vii-xvi) . He was searching, I think, for some cosmic machinery that would cause the non-teleological unfolding of material sequences to move in a "progressive" direction. He left that project unfinished. We can only guess what Marx would have thought of it since he died a decade earlier. 5. Religion Among the Vanguardists Marx and Engels made clear that they were not advocating re- pression of religion by force. Socialist and Communist parties have always in theory disavowed forcible repression, although actual prac- tice at certain times and places was doubtless different. The Soviet Union permitted itself a state-sponsored program for propagation of the (anti-religious) faith and I presume Soviet bloc nations did likewise. Thus the foreword to a volume of selections titled Marx and Engels on Religion issued by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publish- ing House in 1957 contains the following admonition: . . . great importance attaches to the directions given by the classics of Marxism that the struggle against religion must not be pursued by adminis- trative interference in the affairs of religious people but by profound and systematic scientific atheist propaganda. (ME, 1957, 10.) The foreword was signed by the "Institute of Marxism-Leninism of C.C. [Central Committee] CPSU." Marx and Engels had seen no need for special education but assumed that when the material base of religion - class exploitation - was finally abolished by proletarian revolution, religion would fade from consciousness. Even in societ- ies that actually experienced Communist revolutions, however, no such fading away occurred; and Marxists would not have expected it to occur in capitalist welfare states where the "material base" contin- ued rampant. What was the stance toward religion, then, of Social-Democratic and Communist parties during the welfare state era? Did they make ¿^conversion an issue of party discipline, or simply leave it to per- sonal choice - as for example in selecting a trade, or choosing be- tween monogamist and pluralistic modes of sexuality? Since neither</page><page sequence="15">322 SCIENCE &amp; SOCIETY Marxist theory nor, so far as I know, the researches of labor historians, has come up with any definitive answer to this question, I will turn here to personal experience and my own not-altogether-empirical observations. Individuals attracted intellectually to Marxist thought were generally at the same time separating themselves from theistic beliefs and denominational affiliations. This was my own route and probably was typical for people of middle-class background in the United States and Western Europe, whose cultural socialization (even nowadays) still reflects the great sweep of Enlightenment anti- clericalism. But that of course was not the only route of entry, espe- cially for working people in periods of sharp class struggle such as the Great Depression. Radicalized workers, attracted by the militancy of Marxist-led organizations, were then likely to be turned away by the hostility of those same organizations to religion. In the United States, these patterns remained typical, especially for African Ameri- cans (Kelley, 1990) and Irish working-class communities. Undoubt- edly this thwarted party growth. Party regulars, eager for new recruits and mindful of warnings against "repression," might try to softpedal religious questions; yet in a milieu where (as in most party clubs) study of the "classics" was always on the agenda, that was not easy to do. The result would be either that the new recruit dropped out, or dropped religion - the former being the more probable outcome (Saxton, 1997, 144-9). Marxists, then - however they had arrived at their persuasion - usually described themselves as atheists or non-believers, although they seldom pushed an anti-religious line aggressively. During my years in the Communist Party it was not unusual to be involved in group discussions, sometimes individual grillings, aimed at uncover- ing and eradicating traces of white racism or male chauvinism; but I cannot recall having ever heard of such an inquiry with respect to religion. The fact is, religion was not much talked about and I sus- pect that was the case in other radical groups and organizations as well. For this there were two compelling reasons, which have, how- ever, opposite slants. Among radicals I knew during my years as a history professor, religion stayed on the back burner because it seemed uninteresting and irrelevant. Some of us - if for example we were working in political history - might decide that Lutheran pietism had played a major role in the voting behavior of second</page><page sequence="16">MARXISM AND RELIGION 323 generation Germans in the Midwest; but for us, now, in our immedi- ate lives, this would seem - how shall we say it - academic. In younger days, however, when I was a seaman, construction worker and labor unionist, the reason for avoiding religious talk was that it was divisive and potentially dangerous. The Era of Seculariza- tion, as already several times noted, had less impact in working class communities than in others; and the era itself ended soon after the Second World War. This means that radicals, Marxists, party work- ers, labor organizers, often found themselves attempting to operate in communities where religion was widely held and powerfully insti- tutionalized. Sometimes this virtually precluded organizational activ- ity; at other times, however - thanks to the catastrophic nature of industrial capitalism (which has grown worse, not better, since Marx and Engels scrutinized it) - workers and their families would be pushed toward radicalism by the stringency or injustice of their eco- nomic circumstances. They might then begin to break away from religious institutions or (more rarely) push the institutions along with them. In either case, religion became a storm center of conflict and tension. Upsurges of religion could destroy laboriously constructed networks of confidence; they increased the vulnerability both of or- ganizers and organized. Many a Marxist organizer doubtless wished (as occasionally I did) that Marx and Engels had kept their mouths shut about religion. To study labor conflicts from inside the gardens of academia (as I have been privileged to do since becoming a historian) is to be sheltered, partially, from the hostilities they engender. While on one hand this makes research move more easily, on the other it softens (and distorts) the hard bite of reality. I want to call up from personal experience two episodes, vividly remembered, which highlight for me the absolute relevance and immediacy of the religious problem in labor conflict. 6. Sheep and Shepherds When I was going to sea during the Second World War I some- times wrote articles for the New Masses describing conditions in At- lantic and Mediterranean ports I visited. I knew several of the editors and when I was in New York, "on the beach," they would take me to</page><page sequence="17">324 SCIENCE àf SOCIETY lunch in lieu of payment for the articles. The New Masses had its of- fice in the famous old loft building on 12th or 13th Street, east of Broadway, which also housed the Communist Party and Daily Worker. Even in those days a guard at the elevator gate checked your busi- ness and frisked you for concealed weapons. As we waited, my editor introduced me to the man ahead of us, who turned out to be Louis Budenz, managing editor of the Daily Worker. I had not met Budenz and never saw him again; but I see him there yet, a stocky, tired- looking middle aged man in his not-very-new overcoat (New York can be bitter cold in February) waiting his turn for the up-elevator. Born in the 1890s in Indianapolis to a staunchly Catholic, mar- ginally middle-class family, Budenz, after working for the Catholic Young Men's Institute, moved leftward, serving as a state manager in LaFollette's 1924 presidential campaign, and with the onset of depres- sion threw himself into the movement for industrial unionism where he became a labor journalist as well as a courageous and of ten jailed strike leader. Joining the Communist Party in 1935, Budenz worked as labor editor of the Daily Worker. He went to Chicago to set up a new (but short-lived) party paper, then back to New York in 1940 to the top post at the Daily Worker (Packer, 1962, 121-77). Approximately at the time I met him, he had determined to return to the faith of his child- hood. He was laying plans with Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, the celebrated Catholic head-hunter and savior-of-souls, to conduct this transforma- tion in a manner that would prove as damaging as possible to the Com- munist Party in which, meanwhile, Budenz continued to function as a leading member. "At the Daily Worker," he recalled, "I criticized copy, made proposals and revisions on pieces to back the [party] line - and fingered a rosary in my pocket as I did so" (Budenz, 1947, 346). Bishop Sheen was well connected for the public relations of soul- saving, his other most newsworthy conquest being Clare Booth Luce, wife of Henry Luce, who in turn was CEO of Time/Life, and self-styled inventor of the term, "the American Century." Sheen arranged for Budenz and his till-then-common-law wife to be properly united in a "secret" ceremony at St Patrick's Cathedral (leaked to the press ahead of time) . Budenz then issued a statement featured by newspapers and radio stations all over the western world in which he announced that "by God's grace" he had returned "fully to the faith of my fathers," and ended by declaring that Communism and Catholicism were ir- reconcilable. "Communism ... is in unending conflict with religion</page><page sequence="18">MARXISM AND RELIGION 325 and true freedom" (349). The date was October, 1945. The United Nations had concluded its founding convention in San Francisco three months earlier. Budenz joined the graduate faculty at Fordham in 1946. He became virtually a full-time consultant to the FBI and various congressional un-American activities committees. According to Harvey Klehr's biographical sketch in American National Biography, Budenz testified in at least 60 trials, hearings and deportation cases and appeared as a government witness in the first Communist Party Smith Act trial (Klehr, 1999, 3:872-3; Packer, 1962, 121-4). In October 1945, 1 was on a ship loaded with ammunition origi- nally intended for the invasion of Japan, which had been rendered unnecessary, so the story went, by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was January 1946 before I got home - home being now San Francisco, where my wife had moved earlier with our two children. My first shore-side job was working for Harry Bridges, presi- dent of the West Coast Longshoremen's Union (ILWU). My task was not to organize longshoremen (who were already organized) but to take part in what seemed a marvelously promising enterprise, the Committee for Maritime Unity (CMU). Maritime and shore-side work- ers in those days (and still today, to the extent they are organized at all) were divided among ten or twelve old craft unions, constantly feuding among themselves and sabotaging one another's bargaining and organizational efforts. The two largest (and newest) of these were the West Coast Longshoremen's Union and the National Maritime Union (NMU) , based mainly in Atlantic and Gulf ports. Each of these unions had come together during the Depression through ferocious strikes and intense waterfront warfare. Both had adopted partially industrial organizational forms; both had joined the CIO; both had been constructed by Marxist-oriented activists; and now (1946) both brought forward as chieftains tough, charismatic figures who had distinguished themselves in earlier struggles by their courage, hon- esty and radicalism. Counterpart to Bridges was Joseph Curran, presi- dent of the National Maritime Union. Constructing the Committee for Maritime Unity ran rather smoothly. Workers understood and approved its purpose. The old hard-line craft unions (Harry Lundberg's Sailors' Union of the Pa- cific especially) maintained an angry opposition, but enough middle and left oriented unions signed on to make a nationwide strike viable. In the summer of 1946 I went with Bridges and other CMU staffers</page><page sequence="19">326 SCIENCE àf SOCIETY to Chicago for strategy meetings with Curran and CMU people from the East. Bridges and Curran, well-acquainted from previous encoun- ters, worked together efficiently, if not very cordially, figuring out how the CMU would negotiate for (and control) the multiple unions of which it was composed; and how to organize the strike itself, since, as everyone knew, negotiations with the shipping and longshoring associations were certain to deadlock. That they did. The CMU then shut down the nation's ports on all three seacoasts. Picket lines were solid; no effort was made to break them; within about a week nego- tiations were under way again which led to fairly substantial wage gains (against the escalating postwar price inflation) and a scattering of other benefits for the participating unions. This strike had been short, well-organized despite the enormous span of its operations, peaceful, and moderately successful; one might describe it as a textbook model of the kind of strike union leaders hope for but don't often get. It established the pre-eminence of the Longshoremen's Union and National Maritime Union in the mari- time industry. It stood in prominent contrast to setbacks and violent opposition labor had been encountering in 1946. Only a few months earlier President Truman had broken a railroad strike by threaten- ing to draft strikers into the military, and actually pushed such a measure in Congress, thereby paving the way for the Taft-Hartley Act (1947) , which by comparison would seem mild. In retrospect, it is clear that segments of America's industrial capitalist establishment - eager to roll back concessions unwillingly made to welfare state-ism during the Depression - were now exploiting the anxieties of postwar re- conversion to reduce organized labor, especially its militant indus- trial wing, to paper tigers. Many signs pointed in that direction. The CMU strike represented a small but significant sign pointing to the possibility of a different agenda. Early in 1947 Curran resigned as co-chair of the CMU, accompa- nying his resignation with a denunciation of the Communist Party, the apparent implications being, first, that the CMU was a Commu- nist front, and, second, that its efforts to unify the maritime working class served the interests of the Soviet Union. Curran, a Catholic or ex-Catholic, had been under pressure since the early 1940s by the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists (ACTU) to break his long alliance with radical left wingers and Communists who had played a crucial part in building the union. The Catholic Trade Unionists,</page><page sequence="20">MARXISM AND RELIGION 327 increasingly influential after the war, had previously always demon- ized Curran and sought to defeat him in elections. They now praised him, and in his next run for re-election (1949) stood among his stron- gest supporters. Curran's resignation of course torpedoed the CMU. It also proved devastating to his own union, since it left many of the NMU's most militant and experienced members defenseless not only against the ACTU, but also against Taft-Hartley prosecutions, depor- tation proceedings, attacks by local and congressional red-hunting committees; above all to blacklisting by the Coast Guard, which con- trolled the issuance of Coast Guard passes, essential to every work- ing seaman (Seaton, 1981, 663, 156-8, 208, 218, 231-2, note 55). 7. Ideology or Utopia? Louis Budenz wrote in his autobiography that the most decisive of his several encounters with Bishop Sheen occurred nine years before he reached his own decision to leave the Communist Party and return to Catholicism. During the first year of the Communist Party's so-called Popular Front period (1937), Budenz, having just taken over the Daily Worker editorship, had opened a public debate with Sheen. The debate began with hostile declarations on both sides, but Budenz, pursuing the conciliatory line of the Popular Front, hoped it might move to more harmonious levels. When Sheen sug- gested they meet for lunch, Budenz accepted, and "in an obscure corner" of a midtown hotel grill room the two men talked "for an hour in earnest, quiet tones." "He was not disposed to contradict me in our face-to-face discussion," Budenz recalled of their conversation. "What he did, instead, took me totally by surprise." Monsignor bent forward and exclaimed: "Let us now talk of the Blessed Virgin!" For those who are beyond the bounds of belief, this incident will have little significance. They will not comprehend what went on in my soul at those words. . . . "Very well," I said simply to Monsignor. He saw that I was deeply moved. And so he spoke of the Mother of God. ... Of all the epi- sodes that have crowded my varied career, this memento to Mary was the most electric, the most awe-inspiring. . . . (Budenz, 1947, 155-64.) Whether or not one concurs with Budenz's view of who the good guys and bad guys in this narrative are, there is no doubt the story itself conveys the enormous influence of religion in governing human</page><page sequence="21">328 SCIENCE &amp; SOCIETY behavior, even (or especially) under circumstances of intense class conflict. How can we explain this power? The answer may seem easy and obvious for believers like Bishop Sheen and the ex-Communist Louis Budenz, but bafflingly difficult for secularists like myself. My own ideas about history, class conflict and industrial capitalism are predominantly Marxist; but I do not think what Marx and Engels wrote about religion provides an adequate explanation of its power. Let me begin (as Marx did with Hegel) by turning the Budenz episode upside down. We can call it a thought experiment. Not long before he joined the Communist Party, Budenz had been a strike leader at Auto-Lite in Toledo, Ohio. The issue was industrial union- ism. Auto-Lite's management brought in the National Guard, which shot several striking workers, killing two. Suppose we imagine now that one of the CEOs at Auto-Lite arranged a clandestine meeting with Budenz and offered him a faculty appointment at Fordham if he would denounce other union leaders as Communist dupes and testify against them on charges of incitement to violence. Budenz asks for a day to think this over. He then consults his spiritual adviser. The adviser, however, is not Fulton J. Sheen but someone more like Dor- othy Day, for example, of the Catholic Worker (Seaton, 1981, 55). "Let us talk now about the Virgin Mary," says the adviser (this quotation of course is imaginary) : "Mary, Mother of God, gave her son to die on the cross to liberate the world's oppressed and downtrodden masses. How could you even think of betraying her trust by selling out the workers who rely on you?" (Day, 1952, 220-1). Is such a scenario conceivable? One might think it could not have been for Marx and Engels, since it makes religion liberating rather than oppressive. Yet some of their writings point to that conclusion. "Religious distress," Marx wrote in 1844, "is . . . the expression of real distress and the protest against real distress . . . the sigh of the oppressed creature ..." (ME, 1964, 42, vii-xiv). Engels attributed Christianity's spectacular rise in the Roman Empire to enslaved and exploited populations3 and he represented the Hussites and Anabaptists as religiously inspired rebels fighting to liberate peasants from feudal- ism (Raines, 2002, 203-37). Why might not religion then inspire working-class rebels against industrial capitalism? The fact is it has 3 That Engels was mistaken as to the social milieu of early Christianity - now generally lo- cated among urban artisans and trades people (Meeks, 1983, passim) - does not invali- date his attribution of sometimes liberating potentials to religion.</page><page sequence="22">MARXISM AND RELIGION 329 done so - a dramatic (and relatively recent) example being that of Liberation Theology in Latin America. While it may be true that most such movements have been crushed by their respective ruling classes and dominant clergies, that can be explained by noting that religion generated privileged hierarchies which usually merged into the exist- ing ruling class. These causal connections might be seen as contingent (as Marx and Engels apparently perceived them); or as resulting nec- essarily from the social power that religion placed in the hands of its professionals. Max Weber and Karl Mannheim (long after Marx and Engels) attributed to religious movements a maturation process that would make them "utopian" (Mannheim, 1936) , or charismatic (Weber, 1963, xxxiii-xxxv, 2, 46-79), during their earlier phases (consequently open to liberationist politics); but afterwards defensive or "ideologi- cal," hence at the service of reactionary politics. 8. The Failed Critique Marx and Engels, as I noted earlier, were by no means clear in their ideas on the origins of religion. They generally (but not always) characterized religion as reactionary because of its customary alliance with ruling class ideologies. Ideology was treated negatively, as ob- scurantism intended to conceal class exploitation. They sometimes spoke of religion and ideology as identical, or of the one (religion) as contained within the other. They even suggested that religion had been invented for ideological purposes. These explanations all shared a common problem of placing religion's starting point fate in human culture, since they all began by enclosing religion within ideology; and ideology (understood in the Marxian system as a by-product of gender and class exploitation) must have originated with the division of labor. But that left dangling the question of whether religion it- self existed before class society.4 Feuerbach, by contrast - who traced religion back to the begin- nings of human culture - had described it as "man's earliest and 4 Over the span of their writings Marx and Engels tried out various concepts of religion. The major themes are covered, I think, by the following citations: ME, 1970, 47, 51; ME, 1998, 48, 58; Marx, n.d. (c. 1936), 91-2; ME, 1964, 147-8. Engels in 1876 summarized what was probably their collective view at that late date: "Tribes developed into nations and states. Law and politics arose, and with them that fantastic reflection of human things in the human mind - religion." Religion then became the core of "the idealistic world outlook" which since ancient times had "dominated men's minds" (Engels, 1972, 258-9).</page><page sequence="23">330 SCIENCE àf SOCIETY also indirect form of self-knowledge"; religion epitomized "the child- like condition of humanity" (Feuerbach, 1957, 13). What remained significantly different between the Marxist and Feuerbachian varia- tions was that whereas one locked religion into ruling-class ideology, the other opened possibilities for links to lower-class movements such as Liberation Theology or Anabaptism. Given their assumption that all ideologies must be exploitive, Marx and Engels generally favored their own version over the Feuerbachian (Engels, 1941, 18, 24-5). Yet they were at the same time hard-pressed for a materialist account of religion that could free them from the idealist epistemologies that dominated German (and most other philosophy) in the 19th cen- tury. Their initial enthusiasm for Feuerbach's Essence of Christianity was precisely for this reason. Thus they uncritically borrowed his definition which - aside from being incompatible with their own views on ideology - was not really a definition at all, but a loose- limbed, romantically-inclined description. To incorporate this into their own writings had the effect of inhibiting more far-reaching materialist investigations, whether by themselves or their followers (Carver, 1989, 126). Reinhold Niebuhr, in an impressive introduction to a collection of Marx and Engels on religion (1964), accused them of making a major error by "wrongly" assuming that empirical epistemology must necessarily point to materialist hypotheses (Niebuhr, 1964, vii-ix). I suspect it may have been the other way around: that having already determined on materialist history, they were looking for a compat- ible epistemology to introduce it. Niebuhr's criticism, however, car- ries a revealing corollary. In this golden age of science, he is saying, we are obligated to work from empirical epistemologies, yet remain free to pursue hypotheses - including causal explanations of reli- gion - idealist or materialist, as the empirical evidence seems to war- rant. Although I remain unpersuaded by Niebuhr's assurance that any final hypothesis must be idealist (i.e., religious), his observation helps to explain the continuing liability of materialist thought to lapse into escapist idealisms. 9. Causes (and Consequences) of the Failed Critique The materialist interpretation of history has always stood at the center of Marxian efforts to construct a thought-system about the</page><page sequence="24">MARXISM AND RELIGION 331 human condition. No materialist interpretation, however, could com- mand persuasive power unless it were grounded in a materialist ex- planation of religion itself. That, as Marx insisted from the beginning, had to be the starting point, the opening "premise of all criticism." Yet to reinterpret history in materialist terms is a terrifying under- taking. Even such bold travelers as Marx and Engels sometimes backed off. So, after their transition from Hegelian idealism to his- torical materialism - feeling obligated, apparently, to provide his- tory with a "progressive" inner compass - they had installed their world-lifting role for the proletariat. Was this a temporary failure of nerve? Engels, writing many years later (1888) in a retrospective sum- mary of their relations to Feuerbach, suggests (on the contrary) that it expressed an outlook long shared by himself and Marx: All successive historical systems are only transitory stages in the endless course of development of human society from the lower to the higher. Each stage is necessary, and therefore justified for the time and conditions to which it owes its origin. (ME, 1964, 218.) I agree with Niebuhr that to invoke a "necessary" progress from "lower to higher" amounts to an essentially idealist and unsubstantiated in- trusion into what had been projected as a materialist rendering. So far as internal logic is concerned, that would suffice to discredit it; and if to this we add the conceptual problems referred to earlier - lack of clear definition, uncertainty on when (and how) religion entered culture, fuzziness as to its relationship to ideology, and, fi- nally, their own contradictory opinions of its revolutionary potential - we will be obliged to conclude that Marxism (as developed by Marx and Engels) did not entail a necessary rejection of religious belief. To have spelled this out in public discourse would have strength- ened the Marxian cause. Although it could hardly have altered the basic balance of power - since capitalism's entire apparatus backed by revealed and institutionalized forms of religion stood on the other side - it would have eased the way for working-class anticlerics to support socialist politics, and might have raised the tolerance level within Marxist parties for philosophers like Ernst Bloch (Hudson, 1982, 1-20), and for some of the Frankfurt School scholars (Jay, 1973, 56- 7) who were trying to reconcile materialist history with spiritual or pantheist notions of the cosmos. Certainly it would have encouraged</page><page sequence="25">332 SCIENCE à? SOCIETY research into historical circumstances under which religious beliefs actually had acted as liberating forces; and, most importantly, would have pushed serious theorizing of means by which believers and non- believers (without mutual deception) might collaborate for com- monly held (even if limited) objectives. The difficulties referred to above - which might have been par- tially resolved by more open discussion - all involved inconsisten- cies in the party line on religion. Beyond these, however, lie the more implacable demands of credibility in the real world. Religion, as in the Budenz episode above, exerts controls over human behavior which seem to transcend materialist explication. Whence comes this capacity of clerical hierarchies to impose acquiescence in belief sys- tems that defend and legitimate ruling-class exploitation? The ques- tion poses a choice of alternatives: to seek transcendental answers as Niebuhr (along with most of our political-cultural establishment) has done; or, as Marx and Engels attempted, to construct an effective secular explanation. Their failure in this latter endeavor was due in part to over-reliance on Feuerbach; although it would be more accu- rate to say their reliance on Feuerbach was due to certain assump- tions they shared with Feuerbach and never quite left behind even after they left Feuerbach behind. Feuerbach had populated heaven and earth with candy saints and sugar plum angels. Marx and Engels, operating on a scale far grander but no less anthropomorphic, be- lieved that somewhere out there in the cosmos Beethoven's chorus from the Ninth would still be singing the "Ode to Joy." I am of course mis-speaking myself in saying they "believed." I don't know what they believed; but when they ascribed world-lifting powers to proletarians or cosmic transcendence to the Dialectic of Nature, it seems they must have been holding to something like this. Karl Barth wrote in criticism of Feuerbach that he did not know death. Barth believed death was part of religion (Feuerbach, 1957, vii, x-xxxii). Materialists would want to add that death must be part of any secular explanation of religion. A secular explanation of reli- gion would be comparable to a non-ideological account of ideology. Such an account would derive the ideological constructions of any particular class from real historical circumstances of that class; and so also - to complete this comparison - an effective secular expla- nation of religion would be one that grounded the construction of religious belief in real, historical circumstances of the human spe-</page><page sequence="26">MARXISM AND RELIGION 333 cies. Part of the difficulty, of course, resides in the fact that religious origins long precede historical evidence about the human condition. Any explanation therefore must be in part hypothetical, although this should hardly have deterred Marx and Engels, who had often shown themselves capable of bold hypotheses. In any case they were well aware that all modern science remains, in principle, hypothetical. Both men admired Darwin (Carver, 1987, 238-9). By the 1860s they began using Darwinian concepts to explain the relationship of consciousness to labor. Thus, already, they were arguing that when biological evolution arrived at that level of complexity we call con- sciousness, human animals for the first time would find themselves capable of consciously purposeful labor - that being, in the Marxian view, what principally distinguishes humans from other animals (Engels, 1972, 243-64). Pursuit of a similar line of thought with respect to religion would have pointed to hypothetical explanations well beyond what they had inherited from Feuerbach. Sketchy and tenuous though such explanations must still have been at that time, simply the effort to construct them would have demonstrated a conviction that reli- gion - like other elements of the human condition - must sooner or later prove accessible to secular, materialist reasoning. Thus they could have focused attention on the need for such a breakthrough as a crucial step in the Marxian agenda.5 Doubtless there were reasons why this was not done. Marx and Engels were committed to their analysis of industrial capitalism. They were getting older. Marx was in poor health. Their financial resources 5 How far could they have gone beyond Feuerbach? Prior to the scientific advances of our own era, most developments that contributed to "going-beyond-Feuerbach" had already happened while Marx and Engels were still alive. Among these were Darwinism itself, which they took to immediately; and the work of early anthropologists, especially Edward Tylor, with whom they were certainly acquainted (McLellan, 1987, 37). Tylor's definition ("belief in Spiritual Beings") could have served Marx and Engels very well. The defini- tion has continued to reappear in secular accounts of religion (Tylor, 1958 [1871], 8; Radin, 1957, 7-9; Shapley, 1960, vi; Wilson, 2002, 44-5), which usually anchor "belief to psychological causation (terror of death) - a linkage at least as ancient as Greek and Roman classics (Atran, 2002, 13, 67, 269). Marx, schooled in the classics, doubtless had read the Roman poet, Publius Statius, who wrote, during the first century of our so-called Chris- tian era: "Fear, first of all, produced gods in the world" (Burkert, 1996, 31; Lucretius, 1951, 158). These various components were readily available in the last 20 or 30 years of their lives. Why did they not put them to use? The question probably is unanswerable; yet it may be worth recalling that Engels apparently perceived no connection between the advent of human consciousness and terror of death; and that Marx, when, as a very young man, he determined to begin his doctoral thesis by rejecting religion, chose for that pur- pose the upbeat message of Prometheus rather then the grim realism of Publius Statius.</page><page sequence="27">334 SCIENCE äf SOCIETY were meager. To complete Das Kapital, they raced against the dimin- ishing time and energy of their lives. How could one demand more than that? As to their followers, striving over the decades to win working-class support for socialist politics, they were more likely to be evading religious conflicts than promoting secular (therefore con- troversial) theories about the origin of religion. Nonetheless, I think it a pity Marx and Engels, or later genera- tions of Socialists and Communists, did not push beyond Feuerbach. To have done so would have established a solid ground for the en- tire Marxian system, repaying, in part, its debt to the Radical Enlight- enment, and linking it forward conceptually and ideologically to those scientific breakthroughs which (by the end of the 20th century) would be expanding the potential scope of materialist explanation. As I suggested at the outset, Marxian culture and politics provided the cutting edge of anti-religious thought throughout the Era of Secu- larism. To this can now be added, by way of conclusion, that failure to complete the Marxian critique left secularism itself isolated, and intellectually disarmed, against the resurgence of religious belief that followed the Second World War.
