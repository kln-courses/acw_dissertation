<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYYK, 1962 SECOND PRELIMINARY REPORT By JAMES MELLAART THE EXCAVATIONS AT Qatal Huiyuik, the neolithic city mound in the Konya Plain, which were begun in 1961 1 were continued during the summer of 1962. The second season of excavation began on 7th June and lasted until 14th August, sixty working days, with a labour force which never exceeded thirty-five men, mostly trained under our foreman, Veli Karaaslan, at Beycesultan and Hacilar. Once again our trusted ustas included Rifat Qelimli, Mustafa Duman and Bekir Kalayci. Survey equipment and transport for the expedition were generously provided by Turkse Shell, Ankara. The 1962 season was financed by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropo- logical Research, New York, a bequest from the late Mr. Francis Neilson, the Australian Institute of Archaeology and its President, Mr. W. J. Beasley, The British Academy, the University of Edinburgh and the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. In addition the Director had a personal fellowship from the Bollingen Foundation, New York. Once again we are most indebted to the Turkish Department of Antiquities and its Director, Bay Ruistem Duyuran; to the Vali of Konya, Bay Rebii Karatekin; the Kaymakam of Qumra, Bay Adnan Kizildagh; to Bay Mehmet Onder, Director of the Konya Museums; to the Director and members of the Sulu Ziraat Istasyonu' at Qumra and to the numerous other local dignitaries for their help and assistance, hospitality and interest. The expedition staff consisted of Mrs. Mellaart, photographer; Mrs. Grace Huxtable, artist; Miss Fiona Greig, conservator; Dr. Hans Helbaek, palaeoethno- botanist from the National Museum, Copenhagen, who spent five months in the Konya Plain, both before and during the dig; Mr. N. Alcock as surveyor; Miss Birsen Guloglu from Istanbul, Mr. Ian Todd from Birmingham and Mr. John Farrar from Canterbury Universities as assistants and Bay Behget Erdal as representative of the Department of Antiquities. At home in Britain, Miss Anne Louise Stockdale and Mrs. Huxtable have now finished the final copies of the wall-paintings from the first two seasons' work at Qatal Hayik. The plant remains are being studied by Dr. H. Helbaek; the animal bones by Dr. Dexter Perkins, Jr. No C 14 dates are yet available for Qatal Huyuk. We are further indebted to Dr. S. J. Rees-Jones of the Courtauld Institute, London, for identification of the paints of our wall-paintings; to Dr. G. F. Claringbull, Keeper of the Department of Mineralogy, British Museum, for the identification of certain stones and to Dr. I. C. J. Galbraith of the Bird Section of the Department of Zoology of the British Museum for the identification of a bird skull. Wood samples have been identified by Professor A. Berkel of Istanbul University (Forestry Department), through the courtesy of Professor Asaf Irmak. 1 See First Preliminary Report, in AS. XII, 1962, pp. 4x-65.</page><page sequence="2">44 ANATOLIAN STUDIES To all these scholars and to many others not here mentioned by name we are extremely grateful for their help and co-operation. After the conclusion of the excavations, the first autumn rains revealed further wall-paintings (P1. XVIIIb), and after prompt notification by Messrs. Jean Perrot and Mark Glazer, my wife and I were able to clean and record them in early October. SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF THE 1962 CAMPAIGN The second season of excavations at Qatal Hiiytik fully confirmed our impres- sion of the previous year that this site is of exceptional importance. Apart from the discovery of further wall-paintings and reliefs in plaster, rich sculpture in stone and clay, all providing an as yet unparalleled wealth of evidence for Early Neo- lithic religion, we now have such surprisingly advanced technological features as the use of copper, obsidian mirrors and the earliest textiles on record. Moreover there is now evidence to illustrate the transition from a non-pottery-using culture to one in which pottery prevails and at the other end of the sequence there are numerous links with the Late Neolithic culture of Hacilar IX-VI (c. 6000-5400 B.C.). In the absence of radiocarbon dates the Qatal Hiiytik culture may be dated in the seventh millennium B.C. and typologically it certainly appears to precede the Late Neolithic of Hacilar. Excavations during 1962 kept on the whole to the two main areas dug in the previous year: area A on top of the mound and area E on the west slope. The upper area was enlarged a little towards the north and two superimposed shrines belonging to building-levels II and III were discovered. Part of the area was eventually taken down to building-level VI, which here on top of the mound has a floor level some Io m. above the level of the plain. In the lower area (E) a large complex of rooms of Level VI was excavated completely. This lies on the slope of the mound gradually rising north and eastwards to a level of about Io m. above the level of the plain. From this then it is evident that a mound with a height of about 35 feet or more (the depth of deposit below plain-level is still unknown) lies below the heavily burnt building-level VI which we are inclined to date to c. 6500 B.c. In other words, two-thirds of the height of the mound remains to be investigated. Apart from these two main areas a small sounding was made below the large building found in Level VII in 1961 and just to the west of it. A large building of Level VIII was cleared and some walls of building-levels IX and X (the latter with a wall-painting) were found, but no pottery was encountered below Level VIII. As the size of the area was too small for these results to be conclusive, it is hoped that in 1963 the problem of the first appearance of pottery can be solved by digging on a wider scale. Pottery is so scarce even in Level VI that it would have been possible to dig a 5-metre wide trench through the E complex without finding a single sherd ! Such negative evidence based on narrow trenches could easily lead to false interpretations. From the evidence so far obtained it appears that after building-level V the lower part of the west slope of the mound was not covered by any buildings (at least not in the areas excavated). The settlement seems to have receded during levels IV, III, II towards the top of the mound and we may perhaps suggest that the great " skirt " on the east side of the mound dates from this later period. This might find some support in the surface finds from this area (supplemented by finds from the canal dredging) which yield plentiful pottery and obsidian tools of relatively late (i.e. post-Level V) date. Confirmation of this theory can of course only come from excavations.</page><page sequence="3">EXCAVATIONS AT CATAL HOYUK, 1962 45 EXCAVATIONS IN THE UPPER AREA (A) A Shrine of Building-level II (Fig. I) While extending the A area northward we came upon a shrine of building- level II, immediately north of room A III, 7 (see last year's plan, AS. XII, I962, Fig. 3). Because of its proximity to the surface of the mound, this building was badly preserved, but its plan and contents had survived intact. In the isometric drawing (Fig. I) all its main features are shown. A rectangular main room, measuring 5 - Io by 4"-50 m., provided with the customary two platforms and raised bench along the east wall (cut away), is entered through a low doorway at the south-west corner. Along the south side of the room, two ovens are partly built into the south wall and directly east of it a deep diagonal impression marks the :yxl .Ic.u.-, .,? ~c~:? ~7.~?: ... ,? .~~?? .?tr ,:?~P ~I:: r~ :isi.i " ~~s:~i~j ~if~t~??~?? iir, ~)~i~f~ ii~rri s ZI~? r ,~~~ "", ; a-;:r?: ~li?* c?,l ?? ~r- " ?,. .: ? ~?i 11~;1 'i ~=~i',~l??;tS~'~s~~ :i~'~'= ......

The opening in the roof also acted as a smoke hole for the ovens and the hearth. The hearth, a fine rectangular structure about I m. square, was provided with a raised kerb and with the low bench and platform west of it and had been coated carefully with red painted plaster, renewed not less than three times. On one end of the platform stood a " bull pillar ", made of brick and incorporating the horn cores of a bull. The narrow doorway led into a shaft, which must have contained a movable wooden ladder. From the same shaft two other similar doorways led (a) into a storeroom containing two plaster bins for grain, along the east side, and (b) into a series of</page><page sequence="4">46 ANATOLIAN STUDIES storerooms communicating through similar porthole-like doorways with one another, along the west and part of the north side. The unusual features of the building are, besides the red plastered hearth and floor, two further wooden posts, carefully plastered and painted red and a low panel of wall between them, decorated likewise. This is unusual on the west wall of a building at gatal Huiyuik, though standard on the east wall. The contents of the room confirmed the impression that this was not an ordinary house. Between two coats of red plaster there were remains of grain, which had evidently been burnt on the ceremonial hearth. All round the hearth lay the scattered remains of a group of seven clay figurines ; whereas an eighth and much larger figure was found in the grain-bin of the south storeroom (the nearest to the south wall of the main room). A ninth figure, broken and made of white limestone, was found in the opposite storeroom against the north side of the building. Scattered all over the floor of the main room as well as in the storerooms along the west side of the building were at least seven small deposits of grain, and legumes, giving the impression of individual offerings. Four " stamp-seals " of baked clay with incised designs and about a dozen pottery vessels together with much obsidian, some chert and flint and several hundred palettes, pounders, querns and polishers (mainly from the north store) completed the inventory. The building had been destroyed by fire, like all the surrounding houses. No burials were found below the floor. At the moment this is the latest building at (atal Huiyiik that may be con- sidered as a shrine. It lacks, however, the wall-paintings with which such buildings are frequently decorated in the earlier levels of this site. So far, no trace of any painting, whether geometric or figural, has been found at Qatal Htiytik later than Level III, but the presence of geometric wall-painting at the Early Chalcolithic site of Can Hasan with patterns virtually identical to those of some stamp-seals from (atal Huiyiik II-III 2 suggests that the tradition continued, if not at (atal, then elsewhere in the Konya Plain. Red painted panels, posts, benches, etc., however, are still frequent and the red painted hearth and part of the floor continue traditions which go back to the Aceramic neolithic period at Hacilar (c. 7000- 6500 B.c.).3 Many of the finds found in this building already foreshadow the somewhat later Late Neolithic period at Hacilar (c. 6000-oo400 B.c.).4 The clay figurines and the pottery especially look like prototypes for those at Hacilar and in the obsidian industry we may now note a distinct decadence. Flint and chert become a little more common and among the obsidian tools and weapons blades greatly increase in importance. At the same time spear and javelin heads appear to decrease in size and frequency, compared to arrow-heads, and the quality of craftsmanship is no longer so high as in the earlier levels. All this may mean a gradual shift in the economy with hunting losing its earlier importance. Slingstones also increase in frequency, but maces are as common as before. These are of course weapons which are just as efficient against human enemies. At Late Neolithic Hacilar slingstones and maces are the only armament and there is no evidence for bow and arrow, javelin or spear. Ninety per cent of the chipped-stone industry consists of blades and a tendency towards such a development is already manifest in 9atal Hiytik, Level II. 2 AS. XII, 1962, P1. II (cf.

After its destruction by fire the entire building was remodelled with panelled walls, thickly coated with white plaster and then filled in with a clean fill of decayed mudbrick containing not a single object. After the fire it had evidently not been used and the care taken over its remodelling previous to its filling-in suggests again that we are not dealing here with a private lioise, but a shrine.

In the case of the remaining shrines (E VI, 1o, 14, 31, and A VI, i) the rooms were already partly filled with masses of burnt brick of walls fallen and fused in the fire which made clearance with stone tools impracticable. Under those circumstances more debris from other buildings was added and no attempt was made to clear and replaster them, so that they were found intact with their contents. The others had been more or less cleaned out. The main room, measuring 5-Io by 4-20 m., showed the standard plan with engaged plastered posts, benches, platform, ladder imprint, hearth and oven. A low doorway led into an adjacent room on the south side which probably contained the wooden ladder leading to the roof. The walls of this room still standing about I '5 m. in height had been covered with wall-paintings except on the stretch of south wall behind the oven and over the main central platform against the east wall. Unlike most wall-paintings at iatal Hiiyiik, the ones in this shrine cover the entire wall and are not confined within panels horizontally delimited. Preservation appears to be uneven ; in the north-east corner of the room there is only a single layer of paintings preserved (red triangles) and that one is unfinished. On the southernmost third of the east wall the same unfinished triangles cover an earlier painting in beige consisting of what for simplicity's sake may be described as quatrefoils and barbed zigzag lines (P1. IIIa). On the south half of the west wall there are, however, four phases of painting : the first with quatrefoils in red outlined in pink and associated with " crenellations "; a second of two vertical rows of stylised quatrefoils in bright red, outlined in pink; a third of unfinished triangles and a fourth of deep red dots and V's, which continue on the western section of the south wall (Pl. IIIb). In the north-west corner a bold kilim pattern (P1. IVa) in deep red, grey and white covers the entire north half of the west wall and rounding the corner continues over the north wall, where it covers beige and pale red quatrefoils, zigzags and a labyrinth pattern (Pl. IVb). Here also there are dots and V's but in a more orderly arrangement and in a different colour. The red triangles which cover the other walls show that it had been intended to continue this pattern over the greater part of the room. Being unfinished it gives one a clue as to how the painter proceeded. First he put down the red triangles, leaving space enough for the white ones; then he put in the grey ground in stripes, leaving white lines round the red triangles, and third and finally he repainted the white lines. This final over-painting in white was clearly to be seen in the most perfect areas. There are some pleasant irregularities in the design, just as we find them in woven (woollen) kilims to this day, and the way in which the pattern goes round the corners of the building gives one the feel of a wall-hanging. The composition of the design leaves little doubt that what we see here is meant to be a neolithic kilim and the probability that kilims already existed at this time, tentatively suggested in the previous report,5 is now considerably strengthened not only by further paintings of them but by the actual discovery of woven woollen fabrics in building-level VI (see below). The painting of the kilim, the third in the series that decorated the walls of this building, is easy enough to interpret; the other patterns, on the other hand, defy interpretation. That they had a meaning to these people is obvious; the way in which a certain motif is repeated in association with others excludes a theory 1 AS.

Some of the " quatrefoils " are faintly reminiscent of the figures in the rockshelter of Beldibi 6 without being identical, but their nearest parallels are possibly to be seen in the " hands " and " flowers " of the wall-paintings from House E VI, i 7 and the crosses, " double-axe," etc., from House A VI, 6 (see below), the meaning of which, unfortunately, escapes us. Such then are the wall-paintings of the second shrine of Level III, and com- pared to the scenes of hunting and bull-worship which decorate the first shrine (see AS. XII, 1962) they show an altogether different atmosphere. In the first we have scenes of the hunt, animals captured or worshipped-things one can under- stand-whereas in the second we have a kilim and numerous scenes of symbols, unintelligible to us. It might be wrong to think of the first shrine as a " male " shrine and the second as a " female " shrine, for even at such a late date as the classical age of Greece one aspect of the Great Goddess was very much concerned with hunting (Artemis), whereas another (Athena) was patroness of arts and crafts. However, if put in a different way it may well be that in the first shrine only men and in the second only women worshipped, but whether they worshipped the Goddess as " Mistress of Animals " and patroness of the hunt or as the " Great Goddess, mistress of life and death, protectress of women, patroness of the arts," etc., makes little difference, for at this period there can be no doubt that the supreme deity was the Great Goddess, whatever her name and whatever the aspect under which she was worshipped. This is of course speculation, not scientific fact, but it is the archaeologist's duty to try to interpret his material as well as he can. Room A III, ii Immediately north of the first shrine was a room, the north wall of which at one time had been decorated with a hunting scene of which only a small part had survived, below a geometric pattern in black on white, resembling the kilim in the second shrine, which surrounded an orange-painted niche. The surviving fragment shows (P1. Va) a hunter pursuing a stag and fawn. Below this group there is shown a dog (?) and the hindquarters of another small animal. The hunter has just released the arrow and the drawing of this figure in full movement-but schematized-is very reminiscent of the Mesolithic rock paintings of East Spain.8 The scene itself is of course very like the Red deer hunt from the antechamber of the first shrine, described in AS. XII, 1962. The room in which it was found is also probably part of the same shrine complex, and was whitewashed after the fire prior to filling-in. Further Finds In and Below the First Shrine (A III, r) of Level III In the previous report we described the scene of the dancers on the east wall of the first shrine and deplored its destruction by classical trenches.9 In 1962 we sank a sounding below this building and were fortunate in finding numerous further fragments of this wall-painting which had slipped from the wall into the trench, so that their approximate position in the scene could still be ascertained. Although very fragmentary (and often impossible to preserve) the additional bits and pieces now allowed Miss Anne Louise Stockdale to reconstruct the entire painting, which measured 12 feet (3.65 m.) in length up to the vertical post.

It may belong to the same scene, which in that case occupied the entire east wall. Along this wall the lowest horizontal panel had not been decorated except in a deep niche below the large stag in the south-east corner. In it were found the remains of a further painting, badly preserved, which may be restored as a stag's head. The platforms against the east wall of the building covered a number of secondary burials (whereas none was found in the second shrine or in the Level II shrine). One of the well-preserved skulls had been treated with red ochre and the straight line in which the paint stops on the brow suggests that a skull cap soaked in red ochre was put on the bare skull (P1. XXVa). Some of the paint still bore a clear impression of cloth. One of the dead had been provided with a necklace of stone and dentalium beads. In Level IV, a building below the first shrine of Level III seems to have been a normal dwelling. On a projection on the north wall (which here takes the place of the earlier plastered wooden post) there remained a small wall-painting (P1. Vb), showing two running males besides a not well-preserved animal, probably a bull, which seems to be charging a third (fallen ?) figure at the extreme left. Again here is a scene full of movement and particularly interesting are the exaggerated long heads of the men. The hair of the figure on the right is shown in black. This scene was painted over at a later period to which the limbs near the top and the right of the scene belong. The strange object behind the running man defies interpretation. The lowest panel in the north-east corner had been painted a plain red as in many of the Level VI buildings. Rich secondary burials were found below the platforms of this building, accompanied by an obsidian mirror, and necklaces and armlets of various stones and bone. Beads of blue, turquoise-green and white apatite alternate with amber- coloured or pink striped fossil coral, whereas others were of red, white, grey limestone and black beads of coal. Below this building we found another of Level V, poorly preserved and without any features or burials, resting directly on the massive remains of a very large shrine of Level VI (A VI, i) which had been destroyed in a tremendous conflagration. The Level VI Shrine in Area A (A VI, i) (Figs. 3, 4 ; P1. VI) The shrine consisted of a main room, c. 6 m. square and provided with plat- forms against three sides, an unusual arrangement. Along the south wall there was, once again, the mark of the ladder reaching to the roof, an oven or cupboard in the wall and a rectangular hearth in front. The building was entered from a subsidiary room (containing two ovens) and gave access to an L-shaped storeroom, through a door set in a post-and-plaster screen (see Fig. 3). On either side there were raised platforms, and that on the right side upon entering was provided with a low alcove in the wall. Red painted grooves emphasize the panelling of the walls. Cult paraphernalia are massed along the east wall (Fig. 4). The north-east platform had red-painted walls below the groove and was provided with two " bull pillars ", rectangular brick structures incorporating the horn cores and part of the connecting skull-bones of bulls (P1. VIa). In one phase these had been painted red in front with a white band on top and a white circle left in reserve. Another stood on the edge of the platform next to the wooden ladder, but it had fallen over. The well- preserved condition of these " bull-pillars " now solves a problem, for both in 1961 and 1i962 we had observed the marks of such in nearly all shrines and most houses. The custom of erecting these can be traced from Level II down to Level VIII and</page><page sequence="17">iy i t I 1 i ' , r "t _ ..  ~c r: FiG. 3.

From their position in the shrines their sacral nature is beyond doubt; they were not altars and did not serve any domestic purpose. They " protect " the most intimate part of the building-the bed or divan (for this is what the platforms are) on which the inhabitants slept and under which their ancestors reposed. Their function therefore seems to correspond with the Christian cult symbol of the crucifix, and its purpose was probably to ward off evil spirits, both from the living and the dead. That these neolithic people should have chosen as their symbol of protection the bull, the most terrifying and powerful animal within their ken and at the same time the symbol of life and male creation in the guise of the son and husband of the Great Goddess, is only natural. As a protector of the living and the dead the bull-god c ,iwas omnipresent, but nowhere is there such a strong suggestion of bull-worship ts ?1i this shrine where a carefully profiled and plastered bench contains the horn coreQ of six bulls set in a row with a seventh placed in the high projection at the end below the plastered wooden post against the wall. There is no trace of any wear on this bench--on which it would be difficult to sit for obvious reasons. Thi" magnificent structure (P1. VIb) frankly defies interpretation. All one can safely. safe is that it was not an altar--there are no traces of sacrifice in any of our shrines, nor was any provision made for them, such as drains or sinks 'br the collection o~ blood."1 In the reconstruction (Fig. 4) the wall has been restored a littie above the red-painted groove. In actual fact it survived only up to this point and it is therefore unknown whether the central part of the wall bore the usual decoration with wall-paintings or animal heads in relief, as seems likely. The building was destroyed by fire and two large roof beams, running east to west, were found in the debris. The wood has been identified as oak (Quercus sp.) and Juniper (Juniperus sp.). Very few objects were found in this room, mainly obsidian lance and arrow- heads, and the anteroom also was sparsely furnished. Here there were two ovens against the south wall, numerous food remains and two pots. Access to the main room of the shrine and the courtyard outside (west side) must have been through a hole in the roof by means of a movable ladder, for as in every other building at Qatal Htiyuik there were no outside doorways.12 In the L-shaped storeroom of the building a number of interesting finds were made. The floor was covered with matting of marsh grass and on it lay the carbonized remains of two circular baskets (P1. VIIa), a wooden meat dish, 0-5 m. long, oval in shape with carved ledge handles at the shorter ends; two polished stone maceheads, one with a thin and swingy wooden handle, o 63 m. in length, the other with a bone handle; and a number of obsidian and flint weapons. Then there were three horn cores of cattle, spare parts, so to speak, and a very fine painted clay figurine, modelled with a grace that is yet unmatched in Early Neolithic Anatolia (Fig. 29), and a number of the usual polishing stones. Houses and Wall-paintings of Level VI in the Upper Area (A) It is clear that the shrine described above formed part of a complex of rooms and courts, of which only a small portion has yet been excavated.

Of the four rooms, three had wall-paintings (the fourth had lost its plaster). In house A VI, 4, so small that it was probably inhabited by a single person, impressions of a number of red hands, and fingers and toes and of a child's foot were found near the doorway (P1. VIIb). In house A VI, 5, the lowest panel of the wall over the main platform carried an intriguing geometrical pattern in red, badly destroyed but repeating itself so that the entire painting can be restored (P1. VIIIa). Superficially it resembles triangles, house plans and ladders, but its meaning is-as so often-unknown. Hardly less strange is a panel from house A VI, 6 (P1. VIIIb), showing a stylized bull's head modelled on the bench and painted a deep red, orange and white. To the left of it there are a number of stars and crosses; symbols painted in orange and white. The second object from the left might be interpreted as a " double-axe ", but this is far from certain. The cross in the middle is painted in bright orange and purple manganese paint to which a mineral (" glimmerschiefer ") has been added to make it sparkle. Above it to the right a dark red " crenellation " links it to one of the " stars " or rosettes and a number of small red human figures appear here. Best preserved are a fat (and steatopygous ?) female and a man holding a bow. To the right is a small figure like the quatrefoils in the second shrine of Level III and beyond it a female with arms and legs uplifted, in a position of childbirth, which occurs on a monumental scale in the plaster relief in the first shrine (E VI, 8) in the lower area (see p. 6 I and PI. IXa). Above it is another small group of two figures, one of which holds a bow. These are, at the moment, the earliest representa- tions of the human figure at Catal Huiyiik. In the upper register there are remains with points in orange, outlined in white and with reserve designs in the same colour. Certain of these symbols may be compared to those from the Second Shrine in Level III and some of the small figures are reminiscent of Beldibi. These wall- paintings were, as usual, hidden below thick coats of white plaster. EXCAVATIONS IN THE LOWER AREA (E), BUILDING-LEVEL VI (Fig. 5) Compared to the discoveries made in the lower area on the slope of the mound, those described above were of relatively minor importance. During the first season we had stripped a portion of the slope in order to gain a rapid glance at the remains of earlier levels which here reached the surface and we had found extensive building remains of levels IV, V and VI (see AS. XII, 1962, Figs. 4-6). The sixth building level showed abundant signs of having been destroyed in a great conflagration and the few buildings excavated were found to be well preserved and rich in finds, making further excavation imperative. During the 1962 season we therefore cleared the whole area, measuring about 40 by 20 m., down to this burnt Level VI and extended where necessary in order to obtain a complete building-unit surrounded, on at least three of its sides, by open courts or courtyards (Fig. 5) and without a single doorway giving access to it from the outside or from the surrounding courts. After two seasons' work at natal Htiytik, it is now abundantly clear that not a single house was entered directly from a courtyard or the street; on the contrary, the only way in and out was via the roof.l3 Strange as this may seem, there are numerous ethnological parallels for such a state of affairs; numerous Americo-Indian villages practise this system 13 See note I2.</page><page sequence="21">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYOK, 1962 55 5/092 1?41: Wt ...... _'"i ': "' : .? . o43o 7:667 13:r its 030 7-JZ_ - U:1?l iss 7.0:8' 40.* ft 0 -- --- FIG. 5.

Open spaces are shown in darker shade. and nearer home we find the same in a number of the more remote villages in Central and Eastern Anatolia and western Iran. Nor is Qatal Hiiyiuk the only case in Anatolia, for the basement structures at Hacilar I or at Can Hasan in the Konya Plain itself show that this system-which is evidently defensive-continued to be in</page><page sequence="22">56 ANATOLIAN STUDIES use right down to the end of the Early Chalcolithic period. The system, impractic- able as it seems to us, had distinct advantages, mainly defensive. There was really no need for a large defensive wall (which for all we know may exist-we have not yet looked for it) : all one needed were stretches of wall (or houses with a blank outer wall) between the building complexes. The rooms at the northern end of our block nearest the river may be the beginning of such a link. The chance of an enemy forcing an entry into the city through blocks of houses must have been small and the efficacy of the system is suggested by the fact that throughout the eight building levels so far investigated there are no traces of massacre or pillage. It is clear then that to enter a block of rooms one had to ascend the flat roofs of the block by a (movable) ladder from a court or courtyard. A good sense of direction would be required, especially at night, to find one's own dwelling, but one acquired it, no doubt, early in life. Most rooms were provided with two ways of entry, a wooden ladder, fixed in the south wall of the house and opening on to the roof more or less above the hearth (the smoke escaped through the same hole and through the windows which were probably set just below the eaves) or by way of a movable ladder put in a shaft, which in addition may have served as a light-well and ventilation shaft. The well-preserved plaster near the ladder or in the shaft shows that both were provided with a protection on the roof against inclement weather. In our reconstruction (Fig. 6) we have provided lean-to shelters such as we find to this day in Eastern Anatolia, but the possibility that there was a verandah of wood and wattle and daub, a sort of partial second storey, must be left open. As the building complex was constructed on the slope of a mound (Fig. 7), it rose both towards the east and the north. Each house has its own walls and this becomes understandable for only in this way could adequate lighting be ensured. The rooms rose in tiers and so did the roofs (and floors), each rising just enough over its lower neighbours to allow for windows in the west and south wall. The light so provided would mainly illuminate the east and north walls of each room and it is here that the working, sitting and sleeping platforms and any form of decoration are placed to take full advantage of the light. The comparatively dark south end of the house (there was of course the opening in the roof above) was given over to the domestic tasks of cooking and baking. The shaft may have provided additional light and by having a second opening, good ventilation could be ensured. The system may seem highly sophisticated, but we are not dealing with simple village communities ! Towards the southern and eastern end of the block a slightly different arrangement of rooms may be noticed on the plan and this is easily explained by the fact that lighting arrangements required a different orientation. It will be fascinating to find some time that the whole process is reversed on the eastern slope of the mound, where the light comes from the east. So far all the buildings recovered in both areas received their light from the west or the south, which suggests that we have not yet reached the top of the ancient mound. The plan of this building unit-in the absence of communicating doorways one obviously cannot decide whether it is one or numerous buildings-would no doubt be described by some modern architects as " agglutinative ". This, by the very meaning of the word, means that things were stuck on to each other, in this case rooms. The objection, architecturally speaking, is that there was a lack of planning, in fact a random agglomeration of diverse elements, haphazardly thrown together. This is obviously not the case here for it is obvious from the plan that the building unit of E VI falls into two parts, each built on a different terrace. Although the upper terrace looks somewhat rambling, the very reverse is evident</page><page sequence="23">:?-'? ?? r-i ~j~t~z` i I ??i?l . ~..1 ~ ~i~`' 51~ ., ~.~ O r~ qi~~SE~ E~-~ ;r Kh, 11Tliry ~dB~ 1S~~b?4a a ??r~ 41111~a ~-~pg ~(Y~ ~?

These four shrines form the centre of the block and they are arranged within a cruciform pattern of storerooms (E VI, 17, I and 9) running north to south and a large room (E VI, 13, 15, I6) running east to west. Many of the lines of walls run straight for more than a single building, suggesting clearly that the entire plan was well laid out (even if less well executed). Here there is no more case of " agglutination " than there is in, e.g. the Cretan Palaces. On the contrary, the buildings were planned and it is very clear how they were planned, for outside each of the shrines there is at least one important dwelling, and sometimes more. Each of the four shrines is provided with its store- room, often directly accessible from it, in the same way as the houses are normally provided with a secondary room for the purposes of storage. One shrine (No. 31) and six houses occupy the upper terrace, whereas on the lower ten houses are arranged around four shrines (Nos. 7, 8, Io and I4). The remaining nineteen rooms are storerooms or kitchens. The entire complex had about forty rooms or chambers in it, but the number is somewhat uncertain because of denudation at the bottom of the west slope. The entire complex was in use for a considerable length of time during which there were alterations after a great fire, especially in the upper terrace, where there is the best evidence for two phases of building. On the lower terrace the houses burnt were repaired and replastered after the fire (e.g. in Houses E VI, I ; 5), but this first fire was much less destructive than the one in which the whole area appears to have perished at the end of Level VI. In any case the five shrines remained in use throughout the period and as a result the layers of wall plaster are unbelievably thick and often about twice as thick as those in the rebuilt houses, where fifty to sixty layers is not abnormal. The plaster in Shrine E VI, 14, was 8 cm. thick with well over a hundred layers (in a building of Level VIII the plaster is up to i o cm. thick or as much as half the width of the brick wall !). Better evidence for the longevity of these buildings could hardly be found. In plan and internal arrangement there is no appreciable difference between the shrines (or cult-rooms) and the dwellings. All are built on the same rectangular plan. Platforms and benches divide the room into three parts, the southernmost of which is devoted to cooking, baking, etc., and this also has the ladder (placed in the south-east corner). A platform in the south-west corner is usual next to the hearth, but it is along the east (and north) side of the room that we find the sitting and sleeping platforms with a raised bench at the south end of the eastern range The centre of the room is lower than the rest and this was covered with rushes on top of which rested mats. Mats are not found on the sleeping platforms and here one would expect kilims and yorgans (quilts), mattresses or felt. There are no provisions for drainage, and sanitation was out of doors. On the whole, these rooms were kept scrupulously clean and all refuse was put outside, strewn in the courtyard or buried in pits. There are a number of other features, both structural and decorative in these buildings that call for comment. These are the vertical wooden posts of squared timber, plastered and painted red and the horizontal panelling of the walls. These are characteristic features of every dwelling or shrine so far found at gatal Hiyuik and with the division of the room into its component functional apartments and the " built-in furniture" they give the architecture of gatal Huiyik an ordered</page><page sequence="26">60 ANATOLIAN STUDIES neatness rarely paralleled.14 Through subtle variations, however, a balance is struck between barren standardization and uniformity and over-elaboration. One cannot help feeling that already in Level VI one is dealing with an established tradition in architecture, the beginnings of which lay far beyond this period of the mid-seventh millennium B.c. Last year we ventured the idea that posts and horizontal panelling were purely decorative and devised to break the monotony of the plain walls. This view can now be corrected. A comparison of the well-preserved Level VI buildings with the latest ones of Levels II to III shows clearly that the posts served a constructive purpose. In Level VI the walls were but a single brick thick whereas in the later buildings the thickness of the walls increased. In Level III actual wooden posts are rare and shallow brick pilasters often take their place and in Level II the wooden posts are frequently replaced by internal buttresses built entirely of brick. In later periods, such as in Early Chalcolithic Hacilar, internal buttresses are a standard feature, but nowhere do they reach such monstrous proportions as in the basements of Can Hasan or Hacilar I.15 The development is now evident from wooden post to brick buttress and the vertical posts in Level VI served a con- structive purpose, for it is clear from their position that they carried the roof beams (see Fig. I4). Evidently the builders at gatal Huiytik did not trust their thin mud- brick walls to carry the full weight of the heavy flat roof. In a number of cases, buildings of Level VI escaped the last fire and the problem of the horizontal over- hangs in the walls was solved by the discovery of horizontal beam holes or actual burnt remains of beams in them. The strange overhang masked the positions of horizontal beams which with the vertical posts formed a timber framework for or rather within the entire building. I say within, for the timber framewoik would probably have stood by itself without the mudbrick walls if it did not have to support a heavy mud roof. A section through the walls gives one the impression that the mudbrick walls were an afterthought, built up against the framework and only insecurely integrated. Anyone should have realized that the upper part of a mudbrick wall balanced on a beam with an overhang of up to 20 cm. (see Fig. 14) presented an insecure method of building, to say the least. It is not surprising to find that this part has nearly always collapsed and was preserved by chance only where it was bonded into the corners. The fact that this was not realized by the builders may suggest that they were still experimenting with the problem of how to adapt the sensible timber framework of a wooden house to the novelty of mudbrick walls. In the later levels the over- hangs are greatly reduced and no beams are used : the old structural feature had become a decorative one. All this then suggests-in my opinion--that by Level VI the people of Qatal Hi iyik were still conscious of a traditional type of house which consisted of a strong wooden framework with walls not of mudbrick but of wood or mats. Such a type is not one which one easily associates with people dwelling in the middle of an alluvial plain; on the contrary, such buildings probably developed in the hills, where timber was more easily available. This is not the only potential pointer towards a different previous habitat; the reed buildings to be described below (p. 98), the familiarity with the carving of wooden vessels and stone statues, the interest displayed in stones and metal and in limestone concretions from caves in the Taurus and last but not least the 14 Not decoration as was suggested in AS.

Ia.</page><page sequence="27">EXCAVATIONS AT ?ATAL HOYtK, 1962 61 unlikelihood that agriculture had its beginnings in an area like this, suggest, perhaps, the existence of still earlier settlements than those found in the plain. With two- thirds of the mound to be excavated a possible date for such a hypothetical immigration into the plain cannot be offered yet, and it would not be surprising if it were extremely remote. The principles of decoration are as less expected as those of the construction in Level VI. Structural elements, like the vertical posts, the grooves and niches and sometimes the kerb of the platforms are often painted red (or orange). The lowest panels over the platform in the north-east corner are nearly always painted a plain red and this red panelling frequently continues over the main central platform against the east wall, and rarely beyond (e.g. Fig. io). Painting on the north wall in a corresponding position is only found when the plan of the building is reversed as in E VI, 3, 4, 15, 28. Painting on the south wall is found only in E VI, I, which is unusual in many respects and has another painting on the north wall in addition to those on its east wall. No single building in Level VI has painting on the west wall or in the shaft. The south and the west walls are the two dark ones, but this does not explain why the lowermost panel is nearly always the traditional and favoured position for wall paintings, except in some of the shrines (E VI, 8, io) or in A VI, 6, where patterns continue on to the lower part of the central panel. One would naturally expect the paintings to have been placed where they would be easiest to see, i.e. on the high central panels. Their favoured position just above the platforms along the east wall somehow suggests that they had a magical and protective function both for the living (e.g. while asleep) and the dead who lay buried (and were probably thought to sleep) below. The red colour so prevalent in the wall-paintings surely owed its extensive use not only to its ready availability, but even more so to its magic virtue of symbolizing blood and therefore the life force (cf. the red ochre burials at Qatal Huiyk and elsewhere). Just as the smearing of red ochre on the bones of the dead was a ritual to revive the dead, so the red panels were probably meant to keep the living (and the dead) alive during their sleep. The contrast between the position of these paintings and that of the monu- mental plaster reliefs in the shrines is very marked. The latter occupy the most prominent places for they are meant to be seen by the faithful. The First Shrine (E VI, 8) (Figs. 8-i3 and Pls. IX-XI) The First Shrine of area E in Level VI consisted of a main room, measuring 5.8o by 4'50 m., an anteroom and a shaft at the south end. It lay below a large building (E V, 6) which appears to have been a normal house. After the shrine had been destroyed by fire, the debris was removed; all the walls replastered; a new wall built across the destroyed south wall (out of broken bricks, burnt bricks of Level VI and new ones) blocking the entrance from the anteroom, and the whole structure filled in with clean material. A group of objects that lay on the floor of the doorway were carefully left in situ. The procedure here followed is typical of the wvay in which the people of 9atal Hiyiuk dealt with their sacred places. The main room of the shrine had all the usual features and in addition a row of four large " bull-pillars " of which only the scars remain (P1. Xa) (with one exception). On the west wall part of the horn cores and a bull's head lay crushed on the floor, evidently fallen from the wall. Beyond it to the north the bold figure of a goddess with arms and legs uplifted surmounted an enormous (but battered) head of a bull, modelled in clay, and rising out of the floor (Fig. 8; P1. IXa).

The body is highly schematized and only the stomach with navel is modelled." There is no indication of sex, but the upturned legs and the pulling hands are a stylization of a woman in labour, and in this case the Goddess has just given birth to the bull below. At one phase this figure had been painted a saffron yellow.17 On the north wall a great bull (or cow, no sex is shown), 8 feet in length, was modelled in reserve on the plastered wall (Pl. IXb). Its upper part was destroyed by the wall of Level V built on top, but the outline of its head and neck, front legs, sagging belly, hind legs with cloven hoofs and tail are unmistakable. Below it were wavy lines modelled in the plaster, perhaps indicative of water. It is perhaps significant that large-scale representations of bulls (as here and in the A III, x, shrine) should be placed on the north wall, i.e. facing the Taurus Mountains.x8 The only other scene with a running bull in house A IV, I (directly below the A III, i, shrine) occurs in the same position. At one time this bull had been painted red, and like the rest of the reliefs it had been frequently replastered. The south wall bore no other features of decoration than the red-painted groove which runs around the room (Fig. 8) and is only interrupted by the figures of the goddess and the large bull. On the east wall, facing the goddess, the central panel was highly decorated, whereas only two small clay bulls' heads and one ram's head were found on the side panels. The latter had fallen on the floor and were badly shattered, but they had not been removed. Three bulls' heads with knobs between them formed the upper register and below them two slightly projecting " beams " bore two series of modelled woman's breasts, nine in the upper row and four in the lower (Fig. 9). All bulls' heads had fallen and only part of one (Fig. I3) was found in situ below, the others must have been removed when the shrine was eventually cleared. The replastering of the head (like that of the bull pillars) after the fire shows that the heads were in situ even after the fire, when the shrine was reconstituted. A reconstitution of the shrine in its last phase (after the fire) is shown in Fig. 9 and P1. Xa. At this final phase there was no trace of any painting. By removing the 2 cm. thick unburnt plaster from the walls we recovered the remains of the shrine as they had been at the time of the great conflagration which destroyed the Level VI settlement. The goddess at this stage was a little slimmer and there may have been an earlier bull's head below her; the proportions of the big bull on the north wall improved but the real change was on the central panel of the north wall. The great vertical posts had been painted red and so were the lowermost panels in the north-east corner '9 (Fig. Io). The bulls' heads were painted, judging by the first coat of paint on the surviving one (Fig. 13 : i), with red muzzles and red schematized hand impressions on the nose and the sides. The same ornament was found on the small ram's head on the south panel.20 The really spectacular metamorphosis, however, was revealed when on peeling the 16 cf. plaster reliefs in shrine of Level VII (AS. XII, 1962, Pl. IIIb, Fig. 8, pp. 49-51). 17 Like the one in E VI, io, and cf. the white figures of women in shrine E IV, I (AS. XII, x962, p. 6o).

Xb). The teeth and tusks of the boar mandibles had not survived the fire; they were split and broken during the heat but that does not in itself explain the remarkable transformation from boar's jaw to woman's breast. When removing these mandibles from the wall it became clear that they had been stuck in holes made through some earlier forms of decoration in the form of wall paintings. Two main phases can be distinguished (Figs. I1-I2) separated by a phase of plain white lines on a buff ground. On the one surviving bull's head, on the other hand, at least seven phases of painting are recorded (Fig. 13 : 3, 4, 6-9 and IoII),21 which suggests that the heads were more often painted than the wall behind. In the latest painted phase (Fig. I1) the lowest panel shows seventeen negative adult left (?) hands on a light red background (Pls. Xb and XIa). Above it another panel (only preserved at the south end) (Pls. XIb, XIIa) shows a red honeycomb pattern, the cells of which are filled with rosette-patterns, a square, a flower (?), wavy lines and winged insects in white. At the top it is framed by a series of ovals in red, each containing two hands with four fingers and a circle in the palm, white on the left, pink on the right. At the bottom a similar frame contains five-fingered pink left hands in a vertical position alternating with four-fingered white hands in a horizontal position with the fingers pointing towards the right (south). These again show a hollow circle in the palm of the hand. The final result is impressive, bht two of the pink hands in the bottom row cover a part of the red honeycomb and w he.n one looks closely at the insects one finds that the honeycomb is painted over them (P1. XIIb). It looks then as if the honeycomb is an afterthought and an addition, which might explain its irregularity, which is especially noteworthy at the right (south end). If we take the honeycomb away leaving the white figures, there remains a " field of flowers and bees or butterflies " and the addition of a honey- comb involves no intricate thought processes in the mind of the painter. The wingless .objects hanging from boughs may be chrysalises and if so, the process of metamorphosis evidently already impressed neolithic man. Associated with this painting are probably the two phases of painting on the bull's head (Fig. I3:3 and 4) which show a net-pattern perhaps related to the honeycomb. The next three layers of painting (ibid., 6, 8, 9) may be associated with the interim phase (the white lines referred to above). In the earliest phase recovered the lowest panel was painted a plain pinkish red, and the panel above it (P1. XIb) represented an earlier form, less well executed and more hesitant, of the honeycomb pattern. The bulls' heads were again painted (Fig. 13 : Io, I I) with a similar pattern. The colours of the main panel are similar although less bright, but more is preserved. The honeycomb is much less regular and again some overpainting is obvious with, as before, the lower row of hands last of all. The two versions are very similar indeed, but in this larger painting the " cells " on the left are closed, those in the centre are opening up with circles and dots and those on the right resemble the slightly later painting (P1. XIIc). It is likely and indeed probable that during these earlier phases the shrine had a number of bull-pillars and some may even have been painted. Because of this uncertainty they have been omitted in the reconstructions. 21 There may be even more, but the head had to be preserved at a certain stage.</page><page sequence="36">70 ANATOLIAN STUDIES The Second Shrine (E VI, io) (Fig. I4-15 ; PIs. XIII-XIV) The Second Shrine was separated from the first by two very deep storerooms (E VI, i i and 9). Apart from the wooden ladder against the south side of the room access was gained by a second entrance set I-5 m.. above the floor at the southern end of the east wall and leading into room E VI, 27. The elevation of this porthole-like entrance would again require the presence of a ladder. This building, which measured 5'75 by 4'35 m., was found intact and filled with burnt debris. Its north wall and the adjoining parts of both east and west wall were preserved up to roof level, 2 - 7 m. or 9 feet (or more) above the level of the lowest portion of the floor or 2 5 m. above the platforms. The roof would appear to have been c. 0-3 m. (i foot) thick, flat and made of layers of mud and reeds laid on small beams as shown in the reconstruction (Fig. 14). In plan it resembled the first shrine, but it had a central post in the middle of the north wall, at the base of which was modelled a large ram's head with two pairs of horns (a freak that sometimes occurs in nature) (P1. XIIIa). Directly to its right was a plaster box, perhaps used to receive offerings. It was, however, found empty. Not far away, on the edge of the north-east corner platform, the lower panels above which were painted a fine crimson, there stood an elegant bull-pillar with part of the bone of the skull still in situ. The enormous horn cores were found in the debris, broken and almost calcined. A row of holes on the main panel (west) of the north wall suggests that there may have been a textile hanging on the wall. Another row over the lowest panel suggests another. The east wall showed the familiar partitioning, with red plastered vertical posts, platforms and benches. A small niche in the north-east corner and a plaster bracket against the southernmost post (exactly similar to one found the previous year in rooms E VI, I and 2) probably once held lamps. Above a red plastered lower panel there was a niche, similarly painted and containing a few bone tools, surmounted by a fine bull's head with red painted muzzle, and holes for nostrils and mouth (Fig. 15; P1. XIVa). Several superimposed but badly preserved paintings in red surrounded the head ; one of these is shown in the reconstruction (Fig. I5) ; another showed a few clumsily drawn red hands. The head itself may have been painted at the phases that correspond to these paintings, but it was too well preserved to be stripped of its outer burnt and well preserved plaster. To the right of the bull's head a pair of mature woman's breasts, modelled in plaster, protruded from the wall. The nipples were replaced by a neatly modelled aperture from which projected bird beaks. By some skilful manipulation the burnt bones were extracted from the hollow breasts and identification has shown that each contained the entire skull of a Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus), the largest and most spectacular of Anatolian vultures, reaching a height of 41 inches. A grisly collection of human bones, scattered and not in the least like any burial at (atal Hiyuik, were found in a hole below the platform in front of the bull and the breasts (P1. XIVb). The west wall is dominated by a monumental composition in plaster and bone, which when complete must have reached a height of over Io feet, so that there must have been a clerestory over the central part of the building, as is suggested in the restoration (Fig. 14). This need not have been rectangular but may have been arched as in some of the wooden Lycian houses or the one shown on the Phaistos disc. In the debris of the collapsed west wall all the elements, save the head of the goddess were found, so that the restoration is almost certain.

The figure had been painted yellow in at least one phase. Three superimposed bulls' heads, full size, and modelled in plaster round the horn cores of wild bulls-the lowest rising out of the ground (Pl. XIIIb), are set within a door-like frame on which rests the enormous figure of the goddess. Supported by a small pilaster a small ram's head is placed just below her in the same position as is occupied by the bull's head in the first shrine, indicating perhaps another scene of birth. On either side of this great scene deep caverns, single on the right (north) and double on the left (south) side penetrate into the wall without, however, connecting with the very deep storerooms beyond. One might legitimately infer that these are connected with some chthonic cult, the more so as the lowest of the three bulls is shown as rising out of the earth. None of the three caverns contained any finds, but some obsidian lance-heads and flint daggers (one in its leather sheath !) and a coarse clay figurine were found in the deep storerooms beyond. The Fifth Shrine (E VI, 31) (P1. XVa) Two deep storerooms (Nos. 26a and b on plan) and a fine house (25) lie between the second shrine, just described, and the fifth and least well-preserved shrine, on the upper terrace. Although the largest in size (7'5 by 5 m.), nothing remains of its plaster decoration but two superimposed bulls' heads on the west wall, flanked on either side by plastered posts, an arrangement which is very similar to that of the second shrine. It seems very likely that this was again part of a much larger scene. The Fourth Shrine (E VI, 7) (Fig. 16 and P1. XVb) Another shrine which has greatly suffered from alterations is the fourth on the lower terrace. Already in 1961 part of it was discovered and cleared down to a later floor which was found covered with numerous remains of wild cattle, including a set of horn cores and an enormous shoulder blade. Of the original structure only the east wall was preserved (Fig. 16). It shows a number of features comparable to those in the second shrine, such as a port-hole entrance set well above the floor and a red plastered niche in the centre of the east wall. But here the resemblance stops and two animal heads are set on the wall on either side of the southern vertical post,22 painted red as usual. On the left there was a ram's head (with the horns of an ewe) ; whereas on the right was a bull's head with a single eye. Both bore paintings of hands, as if kneeling worshippers had put their hands dipped in red ochre on the faces of the animals. This is the only shrine where the pillar contained the horn cores, not of a bull, but of a ram. To the west of the building lay several minute chambers, used for storage, one of which con- tained the enormous horn cores illustrated in the previous report.23 This building shared an entrance shaft with the third shrine which must now be described. The Third Shrine (E VI, i4) (Figs. I7, I8, and Pls. XVI-XVII) This shrine lies directly east of the previous one and was evidently planned and built with it as one structure. Both share an entrance shaft, subsequently sub- divided by a small partition, and the remaining space is occupied by a granary, 2, Which still contained the carbonized and shrunk remains of squared timber. 23 AS.

The main room measures 5'5 by 4 - 6 m. as against 5"5 by 4'9 m. in the fourth shrine and the walls of the third shrine were in places preserved up to (or almost up to) roof level, about 2 "7 m. in height. The upper parts of the walls were overhanging at a perilous angle and had to be cut away. They were covered with not less than 8 cm. of plaster (Pl. XVIa). The lower part of the wooden ladder and the wooden platform on which it stood were recovered in situ (P1. XVIb). In this building even the south wall had some ornament; a gracefully modelled cavity was found above floor level, surmounted by a panel crowned with a ram's head. Two others occupied different positions on the east wall, where the central panel between the red painted vertical posts had a large bull's head fixed on three pegs into the wall (Fig. I7). In the raised bench were set three horn cores of wild bulls and there was a deep niche in the wall, painted red, just south of the bench. Above it were found three more horn cores of the same animal. Three bull-pillars stood on the platforms and there was a niche for a lamp in the north-east corner, as in the second shrine. The central part of the room was covered with fine matting (P1. XVIc), made of a marsh grass, laid on a bedding of strewn rushes. There was a central post in the middle of the north wall, as in the second shrine, and another in the north-west corner, capped with a stylized bull's head instead of the more usual console, the support for more wooden posts which, in turn, supported the roof beams. The centre of the west wall was occupied by a monumental plaster relief reaching almost up to roof level and about 2 -5 m. in height (P1. XVIIa). Flanked on either side by the two low doorways which gave access to the shaft and the granary, it presents a scene not unlike that of the second shrine. From the numerous fragments in the debris-this building had not been cleared out after the fire-it was possible to reconstruct a figure of the Twin Goddess (Fig. I8) with two heads, two bodies, a single pair of horizontally placed arms and a single pair of upturned legs. Protruding from the lower part of the body of the right (northern) figure was a magnificent bull's head with a smaller one modelled on its brow (Pl. XVIIb). Muzzle, ears and a ring round the horns were painted red, on numerous occasions, and once or twice there were faded paintings of human hands on the bigger head. The bodies may have had some wooden support in them and the edges showed signs of having been painted red. The arms, legs and heads showed numerous coats of cream plaster and had been modelled-as usual-on bundles of straw or reeds, reduced to ashes in the fire, but still in situ. Below the right leg of the figure lay a small pile of bones-leg bones of sheep and some bones of the foot of a dog; below the bull's head lay three to four obsidian lance-heads and below the left leg of the figure not less than four magnificent flint daggers (P1. XXVIIa). All over the room we found small deposits of obsidian weapons and mace-heads as well as a few pots. It seems extremely likely that these represent offerings to the deities. In all about Ioo tools, weapons and blades were found in this shrine alone, many of them in the storeroom, which produced a wealth of carbonized food remains. But perhaps the most touching offering in this shrine was the tiny body of a minute unborn (or stillborn) baby, which came out of a brick set somewhere high in the wall. According to the prevailing burial habit at 4atal Htiyiik its body had been exposed until the soft tissues had decayed; the bones had then been gathered, painted with red ochre, wrapped in a shawl-like fabric and put in a bag and the bag was put in a soft mud- brick or lump of clay which still retained its impression. The baby had then been returned to the Goddess. Still a further sign of offerings are the numerous ex-voto clay figurines, mainly</page><page sequence="42">??; ~?? ..z ?: I?r? ????

XVIIIa) ; sheep, goats, cattle predominating. These should probably be distinguished from other animal figurines, mainly wild ones, such as boar, cattle, deer (?), etc., which bear wounds made with arrow- and lance-heads and which were probably used in some hunting ceremony. Most of these came from a Level VI pit, but there are other specimens dated from Level VI that were found in the shrines. TENTATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE RELIGIOUS SCENES IN THE SHRINES OF LEVEL VI The wealth of religious imagery depicted in the shrines is often hard enough to describe. Its interpretation in terms of comparative religion, however, is even more difficult in the absence of contemporary or earlier material from such sites as Jericho, Seyl Aqlat, Eynan, Jarmo or Tepe Sarab. No direct connections can be shown to have existed between any of these sites and (atal Hfiyuik and at all of them evidence for religion and ritual was confined to figurines and burial customs. As a result, the interpretation of the religious ideas of neolithic man at Qatal Hiiyiik is bound to be influenced by evidence derived on the whole from much later sites and which may therefore not be really relevant. In the case of Anatolia or Greece the earliest (second millennium) sources already show accretions, modifications and syncretism as the result of the arrival of foreign invaders (Hittites, Luvians, Greeks) from the north with religious ideas which may have differed significantly from those of the earlier population. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that the earlier elements of religion survived to a remarkable extent leaving their mark in the cult of Mother Goddesses right down to Christian times. A strong Anatolian element is notable in Minoan-Mycenaean religion, for which at least there is abundant evidence. Shorn of its more specifically northern, that is Greek or Mycenaean elements, this religion of Crete produces numerous parallels. Anatolian influence in Crete cannot be denied and Professor John Evans's recent excavations at Knossos have shown that the first neolithic inhabitants there arrived with pottery and crops that can only be derived from western Anatolia. It may therefore be assumed that their religion also should show strong Anatolian traces. Our main evidence for Cretan beliefs, however, dates from the second millennium B.c., but this is supplemented by numerous myths preserved in classical writings. Minoan religion and its inheritance in Greek religion are the only sources which at the moment are liable to contribute to our interpretation of neolithic religion and mythology at Qatal Huiyuik. In view of the strong conservatism in religious beliefs and rites in the Aegean and Western Anatolia such parallels as there are may go back to a common ancestry. In any case we have no other choice. That the buildings we have described as shrines were used as such or as household chapels for the practice of a neolithic cult, I hope needs no further proof. That in all their essentials they resembled dwellings is not surprising, for man models his deities in anthropomorphic form and a shrine is the house of the deity. Decoration, massed cult symbols, offerings, etc., make it clear that these buildings served a special purpose, even if they were inhabited by priestesses (or priests) 24 ibid., P1. VIIa.</page><page sequence="45">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HtOYK, 1962 79 administering to the cult. There is certainly no space for children romping about or for large families. The care with which they were maintained sets them apart from normal dwellings. That the neolithic religion of Qatal Huiytik was basically concerned with fertility is beyond argument. The mystery of birth and death has naturally fascinated man from the earliest times and with it the idea of resurrection after death. In the shrines of Level VI it may have been observed that scenes dealing with birth are placed on the wall opposite to the one below which the dead are buried. This is hardly a coincidence, but until we have shrines from the other side of the mound it would be premature to suggest that life was associated with the west and death with the east. Wherever any orientation can be observed among the dead the heads are placed towards the west, the feet to the east, but in our area that may simply mean that they were oriented towards the centre of the living room. In the three scenes preserved we see a goddess in the position of giving birth to a bull (E VI, 8) or a ram (E VI, Io), and in E VI, 14, one of the twin deities gives birth to two (?) bulls. Only the heads of these animals are shown, as in the case of the clay figure, where the goddess is shown bearing a child (Pl. XXIV). The analogy is obvious. Although the way of representation is different in each case, one feels that the same thing is meant. Most intriguing, though, is that one half of the twin goddess is shown as giving birth and to two bulls. Does this composite scene show the goddess as maid and mother and do the two bulls, both her children, symbolize son and husband ? Nor is it at all clear what the frame (or door ?) with the three superimposed bulls' heads in E VI, Io, signifies. This may well represent some lost myth. The goddess with a son or/and husband in the form of a bull is common in Near Eastern and Aegean myth but an offspring in the form of a ram-though an obvious parallel among early stockbreeders-is as far as I know not otherwise attested. Both bull and ram are obvious choices as representatives of animal lust and virility, but it is noteworthy that the goat is not represented at Qatal Htiyuk, perhaps for simple reasons of ecology. In Crete the goat, a natural inhabitant of that moun- tainous island, seems to take the place of the ram (essentially an animal of the plain) at Qatal Huiytik, but in each case the bull is the more common animal, and in Anatolia it seems to have given its name to the two most prominent mountain ranges, the Taurus and the Antitaurus (Turkish Binboga Dag-" the mountain of the thousand bulls "). Nor should we forget the enormous bull (or cow ?) above the wavy lines (water ?) in E VI, 8, or its later equivalent in the shrine A III, I (and also the scene in E IV, i, P1. Vb). Only once does a ram's head-with four horns-occur in the same position on the north wall of E VI, Io. Far more puzzling are the scenes on the east walls above the burial places of the dead. Cult niches with bull's head suggest an association-does the animal live in a cave or cavern? Here the Hattic texts (which may well record pre-Hittite beliefs of the third millennium or earlier) may come to our help, for there we hear of a hole in the ground-in other words an entrance to the underworld-or a spring into which the fertility god lives or retires.25 In Greek mythology all river gods are bulls and the whole concept is bound up with ideas of water and fertility. Below the niche in E VI, Io, was found a limestone concretion with a carved head (P1. XIXb), another link of the goddess with caves, for such concretions may well be broken off stalagmites. A connection with the underworld is obvious and 21 AS. XI, 1959, PP- 171-3.</page><page sequence="46">80 ANATOLIAN STUDIES emphasized by the burials or human bones in this case immediately in front of the niche. Not less remarkable is the association of caves in Minoan religion with concretions, stalagmites, as birthplace of Zeus Cretagenes, the male fertility god, suckled by goats in a cave, or the association of the Goddess herself (Eileithyia, Rhea, Diktynna, etc.) with caves or mountains.26 The breasts, heavy as if full of milk, found on the same wall, again introduce the idea of feeding but the vulture skulls inside each show an obvious connection with death-the beginning and end of all life, a sort of dramatic illustration to the saying " in the midst of life there is death ". As scavengers the vultures, and in Anatolia the huge Griffon vulture in particular, played an important role. The cleaning of corpses at gatal Hqiytik, even if not done by vultures, might easily have given rise to the association and a picture of a bird (probably a vulture) found with the statue of an old woman (probably the Goddess) in room E VI, 25, next door to this shrine supports the association. In a more evolved form we find Griffins (vulture-headed lions) frequently associated with the Minoan Goddess, especially in connection with death and the underworld.27 The parallel can hardly be regarded as irrelevant. The combination of symbols related to life and death recurs on the east wall of the first shrine (E VI, 8). Here the numerous breasts remind one unmistakably of many-breasted Artemis of Ephesus, a mother-goddess of western Anatolia. A recent suggestion that the breasts are really eggs hardly changes the fertility aspect and seems somewhat far-fetched. At C9atal breasts are shown, not eggs, and they covered the lower jaws and tusks of enormous boars. These then occupy the same position as the vulture skulls in the next shrine and in each case the most characteristic part of the animal stands for the whole. It is known that wild boar is another scavenger, it will eat anything including corpses and as such its associa- tion with death is evident. In Greece pigs were sacrificed to Demeter and other chthonian deities. In numerous Near Eastern and Aegean myths it is the boar who kills the male god (Adonis, Attis, etc.); whereas in others it suckled the infant Zeus,28 good ritual reasons, the one and the other, for not eating pork. At (atal Hiiytik, pork does not seem to have been an item of the menu. The interpretation of the lowest honeycomb pattern I should like to present with some hesitation. It certainly looks as if the sequence from left to right suggests the life story of the bee with closed cells, opening cells and finally the emergence of bees (?) on a field of flowers. In the second painting it is, however, clear that a field of flowers with chrysalises swaying from boughs (wavy lines at the top) and insects (butterflies ?) was depicted before the honeycomb was painted over it, and this may have been the same in the first case also. Leaving aside the correct entomological identifica- tion or the possibility that neolithic man connected bees with butterflies (even if the first only provided him with honey) there is no doubt about the fact that insects are being shown, and that in a connection with other scenes which are closely related with the theme of life and death. When we look elsewhere for insects in a fertility cult we find that Artemis of Ephesus had her cult administered by a college of sixty priestesses called bees (melissai) and a bee figured on the coinage of that city. Bees or bee-goddesses figure in Cretan religion and according to one 2* Ch.

The supremacy of the queen bee in the hive would have appealed to neolithic man's structure of his pantheon. Honey and milk are obvious foods for infants, e.g. for Cretan Zeus in the myths, and are among the standard offerings to the dead as well as to the deities of the underworld. There are myths of the dead embalmed in honey.30 The association of bee and honey both with life and death is thus well attested and causes no surprise in the neolithic. But what of our chrysalis and butterflies ? The metamorphosis from apparent death to life can hardly have escaped observant people such as our neolithic people certainly were and they could easily have seen some important symbolism there fit to be recorded on the east wall of a shrine. Here again we are reminded of the two bees round the honeycomb in the pendant from the princely tomb at Chryso- lakkos near Mallia, the chrysalises in gold from Minoan tombs or the gold leaves with butterflies from the Shaft Graves at Mycenae. Classical Greek sources reveal the belief that the deceased's soul (psyche) took the form of a bee or butterfly,3" a belief which may well be of immense antiquity. There remain the panels of hands, both positive and negative, with four or five fingers. Here our Aegean parallels fail us, nor do we know of any Near Eastern parallels in antiquity. Modern parallels, however, abound throughout the Near East and in Greece. In the village of Kiicakkoy, our base, a doorway bears two red hands for protection against the Evil Eye. The sign with four fingers is used in Greece as a protection against the Devil, its Christian equivalent. The function appears to be apotropaic. In other places of the Near East, hands are dipped in blood after a sacrifice and stuck on the wall as a sort of signature of having partaken in a ceremony. The hands on the animal heads at Qatal could be interpreted in this way, red paint being a substitute for blood. The significance of the numerous human hands in the Upper Palaeolithic cave sanctuaries of the Franco-Cantabrian area still escapes us. Perhaps our hands served a similar purpose. Communion with the deity or with the deities' abodes is as likely an interpretation as protection or prayer and none of these three explanations is necessarily exclusive. We may here note that the hand placed sideways, often with four fingers, continues after Qatal Huiyiik in the Hacilar culture. One of the best examples was found on a pot in a woman's grave below the floor of the shrine of Level II.32 Panels of hands above the burial places of the dead and the resting places of the living evidently ward off evil, protect both living and dead by putting them " in touch " with the deity. They may have served the same function as the plain red panels, the red ochre on the burials and the textile paintings which sometimes take their place. In house E VI, I5, a panel with originally not less than sixty children's hands (PI. XVIIIb) covered an earlier one which evidently represents a textile. Others occur in house E VI, i, where they are especially common 3* (see below). The association of textiles with both living and dead is not hard to see. We still speak of the " thread of life ". Gay colours are worn for protection and shrouds of various colours protect the dead; kilim patterns have magic meanings to this day, etc. 2s ibid., pp. 83, I16-7. 0o ibid., pp. 257, 269. 31 ibid., pp. 145, 214. ** AS.

G</page><page sequence="56">82 ANATOLIAN STUDIES From birth to death man is protected by clothing, spun and woven only since the neolithic period. At Qatal Huiyik we have not only the earliest representations of textiles and kilims, but the actual fabrics preserved in graves where they were used to wrap up the bones of the dead (see below). Above the grave in which these were found (in house E VI, 5) fragments of wall-paintings showed a textile in black and red, and their function is therefore obvious. From the numerous wall- paintings of textiles in the second shrine of Level III (see above, p. 48) it seems that the Great Goddess (like Athena afterwards) was already regarded as the patroness of weaving. That the classical conception of the Fates owed much to its neolithic ancestor, where the Goddess was regarded as mistress of life and death, needs no further emphasis. STONE STATUETTES FROM LEVEL VI The series of reliefs in the Level VI shrines are a rich source of information about neolithic Anatolian mythology, but their statuettes show us the anthropo- morphic aspect of their deities. A rich collection of stone and clay figures was found, mainly in shrines, but some in dwellings. In Level VI stone is the more common material, whereas in Level II baked clay is far more frequent. This change of material-though not abrupt or exclusive-probably reflects the gradual increase of pottery at the site. A group of thirteen carved stone figures was found on the floor of the second shrine (E VI, Io) ; four others in the adjacent building (E VI, 25) and two others in buildings E VI, 3o, and E VI, 23. Concretions of limestone or broken-off stalagmites occurred in numerous buildings; there were at least five with the statues in E VI, io, and another four in E VI, 25. From their locations and association it is clear that they were regarded with something more than idle curiosity. Associations with the weird aniconic forms in the Taurus caves were certainly conjured up by these images and they were evidently linked to a chthonic cult of the Great Goddess as mistress of the under- world. Many are reminiscent of vague human forms 34 (P1. XIXa) and with a little help of the sculptor these resemblances were easily strengthened (P1. XIXb) without losing any of the object's mysterious and awe-inspiring character. The utilization of natural forms is a feature fully familiar to us from Upper Palaeolithic cave art,35 the first step towards sculpture. At gatal Hiiyik we find all stages in this development side by side: from aniconic and semi-iconic through schematic forms to fully anthropomorphic and naturalistic ones. No two statues resemble each other, unless they form part of a group (e.g. Figs. 23 and 24). The lack of a definite style is the more remarkable in view of its definite presence in the contemporary reliefs and paintings. This makes one wonder whether these statues-though buried under the debris of the burnt shrine-all date from the same period. The feeling that many of them are ritual heirlooms-like Romanesque sculptures in a Baroque church-is enhanced by the very fact that many of them show marked signs of wear and tear. Not a few show ancient breaks or are worn smooth (Figs. I9-21, 22-24; P1. XXb); others were mended in antiquity (Fig. 24). This problem can of course only be solved by the recovery of earlier statues of the same or similar types from lower building-levels. 34 Concretions of " funny stones " are called bebek, i.e. baby, by the Turkish peasants in our area. One is reminded of the story of Cronos swallowing the stone instead of the infant Zeus. See Picard, op. cit., p. i I8. 35 P. Graziosi, Palaeolithic Art, London, 1960, p. 24-</page><page sequence="57">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYtK, 1962 83 There are four figures which might be described as schematic. A white lime- stone figure (P1. XIXc) unshaped but for incised mouth, ears and eyes might be an early attempt to portray pregnancy. Another (P1. XIXd) in grey limestone, roughly carved, may be a seated figure or perhaps a phallus (?). The lower part of a similar figure from house E VI, 25, has horizontal ribs like a flounced robe. More easily recognizable is a fine white marble figure (P1. XXa) with arms resting on the breasts, seated and female. FIG. 19. Small female figure in black stone. Height, 7 8 cm. Dramwn by Mrs. G. Huxtable. Three other figures, summarily carved in a black limestone, may form a group or are products of the same workshop. One of these shows a female with carved nose and incised eyes, breasts and legs (Fig. 19); a second, a male (?) figure, hooded and cloaked, wearing three armlets above the elbow on each arm (Fig. 20). The third shows a bearded figure seated on a schematized bull (Fig. 21), the head of which somewhat resembles the animal heads in the shrines. These black figures are very worn and little detail can now be observed. Another figure in brown limestone (Fig. 22; P1. XXc) shows a youth riding a spotted leopard. This figure and the previous one are the first to show a deity on an animal, a characteristic of later Anatolian religious imagery. This small figure is evidently part of a group consisting of two goddesses and a boy-god, each associated with leopards, perhaps a typical fertility triad of Mother, Daughter and Son, the prototype of the magnificent ivory from the acropolis of Mycenae 36 and the Aegean concept of Demeter, Kore and Ploutos. Of the two goddesses one in brown limestone (Fig. 23; P1. XXIa) shows a mature figure with well-modelled breasts standing behind the animal. Incised lines on the arms show armlets. The second figure (Fig. 24; P1. XXIb) in blue limestone is very similar, but shows a girl wearing a kerchief of leopardskin round the neck.

XXb) shows bold modelling, but unfortunately the rest of this large figure was not found. From the position of the arms it is possible that she also stood behind the figure of an animal. The small figure of a seated male god wearing multiple armlets and a cap of leopardskin, is intact (Fig. 25 ; Pl. XXIc). It was carved in white marble. A similar cap is worn by a small clay figure from Qukurkent 38 which dates from approxi- mately the same period (i.e. neolithic). Then there is a remarkable figure of a twin goddess (Pl. XXd), carved rather summarily in white marble. The figures are seated and the legs are not emphasized. As in the plaster relief of the third shrine (E VI, 14; Fig. 18) two bodies and heads are shown, but only one pair of arms and legs. There is no indication of a difference of age between the two figures, such as was shown in the goddesses with the leopards, or is suggested in the plaster relief, where one of the two figures is giving birth. The statuettes so far described all came from the second shrine (E VI, I o), but a very fine group was found in house E VI, 25, just above it on the upper terrace. Here was found a coarse flat plaster relief reminiscent of the plaster figures from pre-pottery neolithic B at Jericho.39 Near it lay four figures (one fragmentary) of white marble, partly burnt. One of these shows a grim old goddess with an owl face, plump and squatting (Pl. XXIIc, d). With this forbidding figure was found a small bird of prey (Fig. 26) beautifully carved and probably portraying a vulture, a symbol of death. FaI. 26. Figure of a bird of prey (vulture ?).

The second scene shows two figures, but whether they are mother and daughter or an erotic scene is impossible to decide. This small plaque is still unique in that it shows a composition of several figures, and perhaps a sequence of events. 38 AS. IV, I954, p. I84, No. 83- 39 PEQ. Ig6o, p. 5 and P1.

We have already commented on the difference between these two groups, a difference which-- though mainly functional-also affects the skill with which the object is produced. A very fine specimen from shrine A VI, I, is shown in Fig. 28 ; P. XXIIIa, grace- fully modelled and bearing a decoration in red paint on a cream surface. Although fingers are clearly shown, the feet are clumsy. The painting suggests that neolithic people sometimes adorned their bodies that way. CLAY STATUETTES FROM THE LEVEL II SHRINE (A II, I) A group of nine statuettes was found in the Level II shrine, all but one- a standing figure in limestone-made of clay. A small clay figure (Fig. 29; P1. XXIIIb) shows a plump standing woman dressed in a leopardskin garment and a short fringed and probably woollen skirt. Six others of varying size, headless but for the largest (Fig. 30 ; P1. XXIIIc, d), show plump little figures of squatting women, differing from each other only in the position of their well-modelled hands. One holds both hands on her breasts; whereas the others hold the right hand on the breast or stomach and the left on the thigh, or both hands on the thighs. They are very well made and the position of the legs is carefully shown underneath. FIG. 29. Clay figure wearing leopard-skin dress and fringed skirt. Head restored. From Shrine A II, I.

The last figure is quite different and when intact reached a height of 20 cm. (Figs. 31-32; P1. XXIV). It shows the goddess seated on a throne supported on either side by felines (leopards or lions ?), whose tails curve up her back and curl over her shoulders.41 Her right foot rests on what looks like a human cranium; the area below her left foot is damaged.

In this " monumental" statue neolithic man has summed up his creed in a Great Goddess, Mistress of all life and death, human and animal and-judging by its findspot, a grainbin--vegetable as well. Attention should be drawn to its position, for at Hacilar also many statuettes were found in deposits of grain or legumes,42 which can now no longer be regarded as a coincidence. The alabaster statue,43 found in 1961 in house E VI, 5, likewise came from the granary of the house and the small painted figure 44 was found among deposits of peas. Such figures were probably placed there to stimulate the fertility of the crops. BURIAL CUSTOMS AT QATAL HU*YK The discovery of human bones below the sleeping platforms in all houses (and some but not all shrines) from Levels II-VII 45 shows that the neolithic people at Catal Haytik practised a form of intramural burial. The human remains, however, show equally clearly that secondary burial was the rule and the few cases in which skeletons were found in their correct anatomical position (one in Level III, one in IV and two in VII) are exceptional. In those cases the deceased lay in a contracted position on his or her left side with the head to the west and feet to the east. In the usual bone piles there is no apparent order, but there is a tendency to put skulls (or often rather crania) at the western and northern ends of the grave, although this is by no means universal. Particularly interesting is the presence of " ochre-burials ". The custom of treating the body with red ochre is well attested in the Upper Palaeolithic period and survived into the Bronze Age cultures of the Pontic steppe. Similar habits have been noted in the mesolithic Natufian culture of Palestine together with secondary burial, and the painted skulls of pre-pottery neolithic B at Jericho are a more refined version of the same custom. At Qatal Hiiytik only certain individuals were accorded this treatment and in most cases the ochre is put only on the bare skull after the decay of the soft tissues (skull in A III, I, P1. XXVa; another in E VI, 5), but in the case of a burial in E VI, 8, the bones of head, trunk and arms were coated with a thick layer of red ochre, again smeared on after the flesh had been removed.46 In other cases, lumps of red ochre and a blue paint were buried with the dead (west platform, below shrine E VII, I), but there were no traces of deliberate coating of paint on the bones. The custom of secondary burial or rather burial of the bones of the dead after the decay of the soft tissues is now well established at 4Iatal Htiytik. The reason for this is not yet clear but one suspects reasons of hygiene. How was the flesh removed and where ? Here again no definite answer can be given but there are numerous ways in which this aim could be accomplished. The dead may have been buried outside the settlement (a practice which seems to have prevailed in western Anatolia since the aceramic neolithic period of Hacllar) and then dug up. Or they may have been 42 ibid., Pl. Xa ; note the spots left by burnt peas or lentils. 4S AS. XII, 1962, Pl. IX. 11 ibid., P1.

That such a process took place somewhere within the city is unlikely. An additional advantage of this form of burial was that its timing could be controlled and a general burial of the dead below the beds could be made to coincide with the redecoration of the buildings, perhaps in time for some festival. This is further suggested by the different degrees of excarnation shown by the bodies. Some were still partly intact anatomically, others more or less disjointed at the time of burial. In no single case is there evidence for a hole in the sleeping platforms, hastily patched up. All this suggests the existence of a primary resting place for the dead, probably well away from the settlement, where the process of excarnation took place in very much the same way as the later Egyptians had a " house of purification ", the embalming shop to which the dead were conveyed prior to burial. What such a building might have been like, we might never have known but for the discovery of the lower part of a wall-painting in house E VI, i, buried below the later floor and therefore unrecorded in our first report (AS. XII, 1962, P1. XIIa). The continuation of this wall-painting shows a number of objects familiar from our excavations below the floors of sleeping platforms, i.e. human bones and especially skulls with gaping mouths and empty eye-sockets (P1. XXVIa), a pattern that, with certain variations, is repeated on another painting from the same room (P1. XXVIb). The structure shown above these grim remnants of human bodies does not resemble a normal house of Qatal Hiiytik type, but there is a certain affinity with Egyptian " palace fagades " and the Ghassulian ossuaries.47 The most striking parallels are, however, provided by the reed and mat structures of the Marsh Arabs of South Iraq,48 where nearly every feature has some more or less close parallel. Here we find the same tied bundles of reed supporting the corners of the structure, the same diagonal openings in the matting to let in air and light. The Qatal Hiiyiik buildings have gabled roofs, each surmounted by a " flower-like " emblem, alternately in red and white. From the third bundle from the right is suspended what looks at first like an arm, but which closely resembles the chrysalis of the honeycomb painting in the neighbouring first shrine (E VI, 8) (P1l. XIIb), where again it occurs with flowers. Presumably these signs here also signify metamorphosis and resurrection from death, and their position on a " house of purification " is highly appropriate. The entire structure is painted in red and white. There were traces of a similar painting in the next house, E VI, 3, below the plain red panel shown in AS. XII, I962, P1. IVc. Assuming that this interpretation is approximately correct, one can imagine the presence of light buildings of reed bundles and matting standing in the plain well away from the village as the temporary resting places of the dead. Special buildings for the dead frequently continue traditional and often obsolete forms of architecture. Both in Egypt and in Sumer reed structures preceded mud-brick architecture and it is not unreasonable to assume that the same may have happened in Anatolia. It is therefore possible that in these houses of the dead we have the precious record of Anatolian buildings, dating from a period before mudbrick was known. With so much of our mound unexcavated it would be rash to assign a date to the invention of mudbrick which at the aceramic mound of Hacilar goes back to something like 7000 B.C. 47 A.

In the exceptional burials of Level VI (the only two yet opened up in this level) the dead were provided with wooden vessels; bowls of several sizes (some oval in shape), a pedestalled goblet, and several rect- angular boxes. Food remains (vegetable, fruit and meat) were found with them. In these same graves the bones had been wrapped up in several garments. This may well have been the rule at Qatal Huiytik, but in other levels excavated the same conditions for the preservation of perishable materials did not prevail, so that the burial gifts are rather scanty. Articles of personal ornament predominate; mainly bead necklaces and arm- lets, pendants of bone (P1. XXVIIc) and stone; obsidian mirrors (Levels VI-IV) (Pl. XXVb) with women only and weapons such as flint daggers (Level VI), obsidian and stone knife-blades with men. Even the newborn baby in shrine E VI, I4, had been provided with a chip of obsidian and a piece of shell. Beads were made of a variety of materials: fish vertebrae (III), dentalium shells from the Mediterranean (IV-II), blue or green apatite (VIII-III, especially in V and IV) (P1. XXVIIb), fossil coral, pink or amber-coloured (IV), serpentine (IV), coal (VI) and any number of bone, white, grey, blue, red and black lime- stones. Slate and mica pendants are common; so are cut shells of snails. Occasionally one finds cockles, whelks and other Mediterranean shells. Some beads were preserved with the thread intact-and others preserved the colour of red thread. Most remarkable, though, are the copper beads, which begin in Level VII. From these and from pendants and tubes (round wooden pegs) of the same material it is clear that the use of sheet copper started early at 9atal Huiyuik, but was confined to trinkets. The Burial with Textiles in House E VI, 5. In view of the unusual nature of the " burnt textile burials " in E VI, 5 and 25, an account may here be given of the actual discovery and the problems raised by it. The following is quoted verbally from the account of Dr. Hans Helbaek, who took over its clearance and preservation. " On the first day of the campaign a burnt burial was discovered under the surface of the bench in the north-east corner of house E VI, 5, which had been cleared to floor level in 1961. The first objects to be encountered were two finely executed and highly polished bone ornaments (pendants) (P1. XXVIIc, d). The black material around them proved to be carbonized woven fabric. Eventually it proved to be a secondary burial containing six to eight individuals among which were at least two and probably three children under ten years of age. By and large the bones were clean and the skeletons disjointed and most skulls crushed to some extent, but on the bottom of the deposit several limbs were found with massive remains of charred flesh. In one of the skulls the charred brain was found in situ. The individual limb bones and the skulls were wrapped up separately (P1. XXVIIIa) and the whole had been contained in one or more large pieces of textile, probably garments, before being buried and covered by the clay platform or divan. One crushed skull near the top of the deposit showed conspicuous evidence of red ochre. It seems to have been applied by dipping fabric in paint before wrapping</page><page sequence="85">100oo ANATOLIAN STUDIES it around the skull, but it may alternatively have been done by smearing the already wrapped up skull with the wet paint. Traces of this red and uncarbonized fabric remained in several areas of the skull. Several types of textiles were established. A coarse, simple weave was, perhaps, predominant (Pl. XXVIIIe,b). A finer simple weave occurred (P1. XXIXa, c, d), and a type of " string-skirt" or shawl-like material was encountered throughout the deposit. The latter consisted of thin parallel threads bound together with an extremely fine weft every 8 to to mm. (P1. XXIXb). In the course of the detail wrapping a thick (vegetable) string was employed; two-cord, left twine, the single cords about 2 mm. thick. This has not, however, been strong enough to keep together the final packet which must have been of considerable weight. In several places along the surface of the packet were found pieces of a double-folded woven strap (Pl. XXVIIIc), in the flat state (unfolded) some io to 12 mm. wide. Several objects were found interspersed among the skeletal parts. Adjacent to a skull and embedded in a thick lump of textile sat an irregularly cut oblong mica pendant with double thread in a perforation at one end; a polished bone tool perforated at one end; several vessels and boxes carved from wood, but no potsherds. Many fruits, including apple pips; carbonized and crushed remains of herbaceous stems, like a bunch of flowers or a broom. No details could be established except that it was not basketry or weave. In several cases remnants of square boxes with extremely skilfully executed details could be established. A wooden goblet on foot was laid free in longitudinal section. The middle one of three wooden bowls in a stack was laid free and photographed, but a fairly large number of other wooden objects were so far gone that their dimensions and shapes could not be established. All were made from soft wood (poplar ?, willow ?) and all attempts at salvaging came to nothing except for a few fragments. In a lump of textile, associated with a fragment of thin polished wooden peg, traces of copper oxide were visible, suggesting a thin titulus of sheet copper. Occasional bits of fine fur also occurred. This secondary burial must have been exposed to two different fires. The temperature necessary for the carbonization of the heavy muscles of the legs and for the cindering-up of fat found at the bottom of the deposit must have been considerable, and probably highly perilous in a house. It could have been attained on the bottom of an open-air funeral pyre, or in an accidental house fire, of which Level VI exposed such dramatic evidence. However this may be, the heat would have consumed completely all textiles, at least on the surface of the packet and since most of the bones were but moderately burnt or not at all, the deposit must consist of corpses treated in quite different ways, most of them definitely cleaned by ordinary primary burial or long-term exposure to open-air conditions. The soil around the packet did not at all suggest that any kind of fire had been going on in the final burial pit. How the textile wrappings got carbonized cannot be deduced from the condition of the burial. Only the fact that fluid fat-tar had seeped through the bottom of the packet and settled on the outside of the fabric seems to imply that the flesh-covered bones were packed up still in a hot state and, together with the other skeletal parts, put into the pit and covered up. The heat retained may have created a uniform, comparatively low temperature throughout the deposit in the confined space and may thus slowly have caused the moderate degree of carbonization of the textiles. In places where the wrappings were not preserved they probably have decayed because they were screened from the effect of heat.</page><page sequence="86">EXCAVATIONS AT CATAL HUYOK, 1962 101 This difference of heat effect is demonstrated in the burials in E VI, 25, where only occasional patches of carbonized fabric were preserved." The latter included many fragments of a string-skirt the ends of which appear to have been encased in thin copper tituli to weight it down. The E VI, 25, burial consisted of an adult (probably mother) and child, wrapped up in rather coarse cloth. The adult's skull still contained the brain. The baby's skeleton was covered with beads. Funeral gifts consisted of an oval wooden bowl, a wooden object of indeterminate shape and use and necklace and bracelets of stone and coal, with much thread preserved. From these two burials well over a hundred fragments of cloth have been preserved and taken to the Archaeological Museum at Ankara. It is believed that the fibres are animal, i.e. wool and not linen like the Fayum textiles from Egypt (c. 4500 B.c.) which are next in age. Flax was not grown in neolithic Anatolia. The textiles have not yet been fully studied. THE STONE INDUSTRIES As a very full report 4 was published last year dealing with the chipped stone industry of Qatal Huiytik, a few additional notes must suffice here. First of all one is struck by the absence of any obsidian or flint working in the quarters so iar excavated. This implies the existence of workshops somewhere else on the site. Secondly attention should be drawn to numerous hoards of weapons, buried below the floor, probably in bags. Thirdly no single deposit of tools and weapons in obsidian lacks a few pieces of flint, usually stout blades or flakes. Rich material is now available for the stone industry of Levels VI and V, much of it pressure flaked. On the other hand, it is clear that the projectile points with retouch only on the tang are going out of fashion after Level VI. Then there is a marked increase in size as one goes down; the earlier tools and weapons are definitely larger than those of the later levels (V-II). By Level II the industry declines and blades predominate. Sickle blades can now be identified and they are frequent. One antler sickle was found in Level VI (E VI, I4) and it resembles those from Hacilar. The discovery of undisputed daggers (P1. XXVIIa) in flint now shows that the large projectile points are spearheads, the smaller lance or javelin heads. Arrow- heads are never as common as the latter two classes, probably because they got more easily lost. Arrows are dispensable, spears and javelins are not. Little can be added to the repertory of polished stone. Stone bowls remain great rarities, but a few more trays with spouts were found in Level VI. Mace- heads are extremely common in all layers. Axes remain rare, but adzes and chisels abound. The obsidian mirrors show excellent craftsmanship, and the carving of minute beads is unsurpassed. POTTERY If one single category of finds at natal Hiiyiik might be described as relatively rare and unimportant, then it is pottery. Because of its ubiquity and its practical indestructiveness, pottery has become a yardstick by which to judge cultural development, which, had other and often perishable materials chanced to survive, might not have seemed either so appropriate or so significant. More often than not, the archaeologist has had no other choice and pottery has therefore loomed ~' Perry A. Bialor. " The chipped stone industry of Qatal Hiiyiik," AS. XII, 1962, pp. 67-1 Io.</page><page sequence="87">I02 ANATOLIAN STUDIES larger in his theories than any other form of evidence. Discoveries at Khirokitia, Jericho, Seyl Aqlat, Jarmo, Tepe Sarab, Argissa, Soufli and Sesklo in Thessaly have certainly shown that neolithic cultures could exist and flourish without it just as we ourselves can live happily without plastic. The one and the other represent technological advances which, however useful in the end, probably did not revolutionize man's cultural progress overnight. At Qatal Hiiytik there is a steady decrease in pottery as one goes down. Provisional estimates show an average of thirty pots per house in Level II; a possible average of about twenty in III; fourteen in IV and eight in V. Then there is a steep drop to an average of one for the forty-four rooms of Level VI, and most of these come from the last phase of the settlement. Pottery was actually only found in sixteen of the forty-four rooms ! It is for this very reason that not too much importance should be attached to the complete absence of pottery prior to Level VIII, for only a few rooms of levels IX and X were excavated. It is nevertheless clear that the very wealthy community of Level VI used a very minimum of pottery along with their wooden vessels and baskets. From levels VI to II there are numerous indications that the latter remained in common use and provided the prototypes for not a few typical shapes. Among these are the small tables on four feet, the square, oblong or lozenge-shaped boxes; the thick flat plates, the straight-sided bowls on four feet, the round and square ring bases s0-all shapes based on wood, or the oval, round or bag-shaped vessels with basket handles which betray basketry prototypes.51 There are very few vessels which are obviously and exclusively copied from stone ancestors. This is in full agreement with the archaeological facts and as excavations continue we may perhaps be able to establish the full transition between pottery-using and non-pottery-using periods. No other Near Eastern site has yet produced such a clear-cut picture of this transition, for at this precise moment there is usually a lacuna in the evidence. CONCLUSION In this, the Second Preliminary Report on the excavations at Qatal Huiytik in 1962, an attempt has been made to describe some of the main results. For lack of space some aspects have been dealt with more fully than others and some, like economy or trade, have been omitted. Detailed work on the neolithic agriculture and the degree of domestication among the animals is being done by experts. The human remains and the textiles have not yet been studied. Fuller information on these subjects will, it is hoped, be available when the third report will be written. Art, architecture and religion occupy the greater part of this report and rightly so, for the wealth of material from Qatal Huiytik is unique for this period. In the case of religion, some interpretations are offered-some may think prematurely- acting on the principle that any is better than none. At this stage of the work, nothing is final or definite and much that has been found is still puzzling. As many questions have arisen as those that have been answered or only partly answered. There is, however, one point that should be raised and that is the degree of sophistication displayed by this seventh millennium site. Far from denying that there may be others of equal magnificence elsewhere awaiting future discovery, the 50 See AS. XII, 1962, pp. 52-5 and Fig. 9. 51 Also in Hacilar IX and in the Early Chalcolithic of Qatal Hiyiik West ; see AS. XI, 9I ,, p. 183, Fig. 14, I-3.</page><page sequence="88">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYUK, 1962 103 cultural status of this site seems to us at present unique. That Qatal Huiytik was not an ordinary village is, I hope, evident. Apart from food, and building materials (clay and timber), available round the site or further afield in the plain, all raw materials for the manufacture of tools, weapons and luxuries were imported from the mountains around or from still further afield. Among the latter there were Mediterranean shells, leopard skins, flint which occurs only south of the Taurus or in the Elmah plain in Lycia. Obsidian came from Karaca Dag, some 55 miles away, or further still from Hasan Daw or Acigol. Many rooms yield hundreds of stones and there must have been constant trade with the mountains. Coal and copper do not occur in the plain, nor does alabaster or white marble. Catal Hiyiik was anything but self-sufficient. Technical competence was high, so high in fact that it was seldom equalled and rarely surpassed in Anatolia. The fineness of the beads and the thread that went through them, the shawl-like textiles, the obsidian mirrors, the exquisite flint daggers and obsidian weapons, the modelling in clay, the stone carving, the wall- paintings, all bear witness to high standards and luxury. The early production of pottery and the first attested use of copper show that these people were in the vanguard. Their mats, baskets and sieves were finer than what we use to-day; their textiles superior to those from the Fayum. No site that I know of shows such clean housekeeping and constant redecoration. Their artistic superiority needs no emphasis; their mythology and religion astound us. That this neolithic civilization was not created overnight needs no proof-the height of the mound underneath speaks for itself. Why, how and from what it sprang, how it influenced its neighbours and successors and to what extent and finally why it disappeared are but a few of the many problems raised which still demand an answer.</page></plain_text>
