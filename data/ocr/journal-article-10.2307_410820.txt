Reviewed by ERIC H. LENNEBERG, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Kainz was originally trained as a philologist, but the majority of his pub- lications is concerned with the psychology of language. Most of his works have ample illustrations drawn from comparative IE grammar. For his discussions of descriptive linguistics he leans heavily on de Saussure, Trubetzkoy, Hjelmslev, and their students, but he is also acquainted with American authors, particularly Bloomfield. As a psychologist he has a slightly greater affinity with the empiricists -experimentalists and physiological psychologists-than with more philo- sophically oriented workers. Perhaps it is because Kainz's interest in the psy- chology of language originated from his earlier philological studies that his research on the subject is likely to be of greater value to linguists than to psychologists. At any rate, many of his publications are oriented towards problems that have concerned students of language and languages rather than the psychologists of the last twenty years. The book under review is the third volume of the author's Psychologie der Sprache, of which the first volume was published in 1941 (a second edition is in press) and the second in 1943. The preface of the first volume contains an outline for all three volumes. Volume 1 is said to be concerned with a general exposition of the field and with questions relating to methodology; Volume 2 deals with problems relevant to a comparative psychology of language; and Volume 3 was originally intended to be a practical psychology of language dealing with individual differences (Differentialpsychologie) and with forensic, medical, and pedagogical problems. Only the first two volumes follow this outline closely; the third is a narrow section from the intended scope, or perhaps more accurately an entirely different book. Since the material covered in the last volume is of considerably greater interest to research in the field, we should be grateful for this change in the original plan. The usefulness of the entire work lies in its completeness. The author reviews the entire European literature relevant to the psychology of language. (There are occasional references to American authors also; but whenever behaviorists are mentioned, they are dealt with in a critical vein.) It is true that some of the topics are not fashionable at present, e.g. the question of the origin of language. But this hardly detracts from the value of the book, since it is primarily a compilation and critical evaluation of all the material published on the various subjects. Precisely because present research has taken different directions, we must be pleased to have a modern source which digests for us some academic fodder that would cause serious indigestion if we attempted to consume it in its raw state. Let a sketchy survey of the contents speak for itself. The first volume contains many interesting illustrations of various methods- introspective, experimental, symptomatological-rather than a methodology in the traditional sense of the word. Further, it reviews the symbolic nature of language, particularly Karl Bfihler's views, the relationship between speaking and thinking, and the so-called Weltanschauung problem. A large portion of the</page><page sequence="2">490 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 31, NUMBER 3 volume is devoted to psychological interpretations of particular linguistic (including stylistic) forms, such as interjections, metaphors, and tabus, the treatment being that of Havers, Bally, Vossler, Weisgerber, and the like. The volume concludes with a hundred-page section on the origin of language. The second volume is probably of greater immediate appeal today than the first. The chapters on child-language and animal 'language' (the author's discussions are not as anthropomorphic as the chapter heading might lead us to believe) are concise and enlightening compilations. The three chapters on pathological and abnormal speech are excellent, unique in their kind. They lucidly review the main schools of thought and present an extremely useful selection of illustrations taken from medical case histories. As a firsthand introduction to the problems of speech pathology these chapters have no equal. The remaining chapters of this volume, particularly those on the language of primitive peoples and on contact languages, are marred, from the viewpoint of the American linguist, by insufficiently described language material. Interestingly enough, the preface to the third volume does not refer to the deviation from the original work plan which this volume constitutes; nor does the author inform us whether the topics originally outlined for this volume will be covered in a fourth volume. Although Kainz modestly describes the present volume as a history of the physiological psychology of language, it might just as well be called a handbook and survey of recent work on the neuro- physiological correlates of speech. Obviously, the writing of such a book involves the assumption that there ARE neurophysiological events that correlate with speech. While many psychologists and neurophysiologists share this assumption, it is well to point out, as Kainz himself does, that the factual evidence does not yet irrefutably prove the existence of any such precise correspondences. The first substantive chapter (2) of the third volume is a complete exposition of the problem of organic, especially cortical, localization of speech processes. The two main trends (the strict 'localizers', most recently J. M. Nielsen, vs. the organismic school, represented by K. Goldstein) are reviewed once more, but in greater technical detail and in a more up-to-date way than in the second volume, and a compromise solution uniting the two schools is offered. Kainz's main sources for this solution are three publications by H. Rohracher: Die Vorga"nge im Gehirn und das geistige Leben (2nd ed. 1948); Bewusstes, Mit- bewusstes, Unbewusstes, Psychologische Rundschau 1950; Einfiihrung in die Psychologie (4th ed. 1951). Of course Kainz discusses other sources as well, but it is apparently Rohracher's point of view which has been of greatest influence on him. Rohracher, according to Kainz, agrees with the organismic school in that he too postulates a 'ganzheitliche Arbeitsweise des Gehirns' (total interaction of the brain), but he hypothesizes at the same time physiological correlates of all psychological processes. A further explicit assumption in this doctrine is the concept of 'Dominanz', a system of hierarchical grades of importance of various centers in the brain. Thus the notion of speech centers is given new life in this theory, after having been dormant since H. Jackson's and H. Head's iconoclastic activities. To be sure, the Rohracher-Kainz variety of speech-center notions is not the same as that of the early localizers like Wernicke. Rohracher's and</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 491 Kainz's speech centers are conceived of as extensive areas in the cortex, and are explicitly referred to as theoretical constructs. They are to be pictured as foci of stimulation for complex interactions (Erregunskonstellationen). Such foci, it is pointed out, are not innate structures but are the product of learning, a point of view which is very much in line with cisatlantic thoughts on the subject. Particu- larly the concept of cortical 'Steuerungsapparatur' pictured as 'Kreisprozesse' (circular feed-back mechanisms) is reminiscent of D. O. Hebb's so-called cell assemblies. F. A. Hayek in The sensory order (London, 1952) also expounds a neurological theory akin to the viewpoints presented by Kainz. Although Hebb and Hayek do not refer specifically to language and are therefore not covered by Kainz, they might profitably be read by the layman interested in these problems. One chapter is called Das Sprechen; it is a psychological description of all observable and hypothesized processes operative in adult speech. Kainz dis- tinguishes between Diktion and Artikulation. Under the former he understands a kind of mental preparation for the overt speech act; the latter comprehends the observable, 'outer' side of speech. The relation between Diktion and Artikulation is likened to that between strategy and tactics. They are said to be intimately related in normal speech, but Kainz feels justified in treating the phases as distinct--despite their normal interdependence-on the ground of certain clinical material, particularly cases in which a trauma of Broca's area results in motoric aphasia (disturbance of his Artikulation), with the 'inner aspects of speech' (his Diktion) supposedly unaffected. The reviewer does not, of course, object to the speculative aspect of this theory as such. But it appears that Kainz had ventured here into territory where speculation may all too easily tear away from the safe hitching posts of empirical evidence.' As a historical note, not a critical one, one may observe that Kainz's concept of Diktion is closely related to, and indeed largely overlaps with, the earlier concepts Einstellung, Bewusstseinslage, and set created by the Wiirzburg school of psychologists. His discussion of Artikulation covers all those subjects comprised in our terminology by general phonetics. Acoustic phonetics and psycho-acoustics are briefly dealt with; but since for these topics American students have excellent and exhaustive sources available (e.g. Martin Joos and George A. Miller), this section of Kainz's book is of less interest to us. A short but stimulating chapter on the sociology of conversation concludes the work. A matter of minor annoyance is the clumsy arrangement of footnotes. They are all crowded together at the end of the book, but are numbered separately for each subsection. Since the footnotes have no page references, it is often hard to find a pertinent note, and practically impossible to refer from the footnote back to the text. There is no alphabetically arranged list of sources, though in a book of this kind such a list would be a very desirable feature. We are fortunate, however, that all three volumes have indices, an asset lacking in so many other German works of this kind. The last four years have seen a handsome number of textbooks of the psy- chology of language; each has its own emphasis and function.
