It aims to reconstruct certain features of the symbolic grammar of this Melanesian society as they might have been before modernization trans- formed social life. The essay concerns a plaited nonfigurative malanggan object used in death and memorial rituals. It sug- gests that this artefact was an iconic symbol with reference to one of two cultural modalities, each with a different dominant presupposition. The object implied a vision of a universe of pure uterine belonging in a world without men.

Introduction This study offers an examination of some ethno- graphic data collected by American anthropologist Hortense Powdermaker in northwestern New Ire- land in the Bismarck Archipelago in 1929-30. It is an attempt to discover what information these might yield to a reexamination 74 years after their initial formulation in the field, in the village of Lesu. At that time, New Ireland had already long been under heavy outside influences, from both the German and later Australian governments as well as from missionary activities. In Lesu there was a small base for Roman Catholic activities in the area as well as a Methodist mission. There were many settlers' plantations around, providing work for local village people and thus stimulating male migration. A new road, built and maintained by a considerable amount of corvée labour, had changed former patterns of communication. War- fare between local communities had been brought to an end.1 The aim of the present essay is to reexamine a few Lesu conventions in an attempt to explore some aspects of an artefact as an object of art and ritual in a premodern setting. Needless to say, what we may hope to gain is not a picture of some original state, but glimpses of an ongoing social life in a dynamic environment in a remote period.2 1 For a survey of the history of early colonialism in New Ireland, see Derlon 1997a: 24-29; Panoff 1979.

Powdermaker reports on these objects in a general way, from which we learn that Malanggans are the elaborate carvings connected with mortuary rites, and are the most important ritual objects in the society (Powdermaker 1933: 102).3 The objects are wooden and intricately carved and they are covered with several coats of paint (124). The malanggans vary in appearance; some are the figure of one man, while others are intricate carvings contain- ing the figures of several people, each one representing a dead clan relative. Still others have various birds, fish, and snakes on them. The animals used seem to be merely familiar ones of the environment, and without any totemic significance . . . Each malanggan will also be known as a male or a female one. They are usually brightly painted, red and yellow being the dominant colours (317). Powdermaker notes that in her day the malanggan rituals seemed to have lost much of their original meaning, but she does not say explicitly why she thinks this was the case. Having exhausted the material in the area where she worked, she presents us with the facts as she found them at that time. She adds that undoubtedly much more could be said about them and, while writing, anticipates that a visit to the Tabar group of islands near by - from which the carvings seemed to have come - might reveal more information. Powdermaker takes the view that there is always the possibil- ity of eventually obtaining some historical clue as to their original meaning - but at that time the historical approach, which could have been useful in throwing light on the malanggan of the present, could unfortunately not be matched by any history (21 f.). These well-known carved figures have attract- ed a great deal of attention from ethnographers and anthropologists alike through the history of the anthropological discipline. They were man- ufactured in most areas of central and northern New Ireland and the Tabar Islands and, through the diligence of eager collectors, have found their ways into many museums around the world, where they are rightly admired for their intricate "gothic" craftsmanship, their fantastic "surrealist" shapes 3 Henceforth the main source (Powdermaker 1933) will be referred to only by reference to page number. and intense colouring. The oldest pieces known date from the final decades of the 19th century. No malanggans survive in their own environment, simply because after being displayed at rituals, they are left to decay in the forest. Sadly these early collections are badly documented and there is generally little or nothing to indicate in which part of New Ireland they were once carved. Styles and designs seem to have been spread widely through the drifting of patterns and were not necessarily associated with one particular linguistic area or set of villages. Of course, this extensive distribution of conventional forms does not mean that the same shape inevitably expressed the same iconic motifs or discursive messages all over the island. There may well have been significant shifts in their ritual use and their accompanying imaginary meanings. About this practically nothing is known. The output of learned works concerned with this genre of Melanesian art is thus considerable and has formed a classical field of anthropological enquiry. The present contribution to the still ongo- ing discussion is but a more modest one and will concern only one particular brand of malanggan, which, unusually, was not carved and is in a totally different style. My discussion of this sort of sym- bolic object will take as its starting point a part of Powdermaker' s early ethnography, but I shall also look at some other, earlier and later accounts of the Notsi-speaking area - and make some ex- cursions beyond - to make the picture as rich as possible. My aim is always to apply contemporary anthropological and symbological thinking to early ethnography in an attempt to reconstruct premod- ern processes of ritual and aesthetic life in this small segment of Melanesia. Powdermaker tells us only a few things about this quite different type of malanggan object used in Lesu, which she describes as follows: Here . . . was ... the warawara malanggan ... In the centre was the large breast ornament, kepkep, and around it was an intricate weaving of different-coloured leaves (311; cf. 317). The context for this brief description is one par- ticular funeral: About the middle of the morning a group of twenty women of the Hawk moiety, their hair decorated with leaves, entered the [village] compound singing. Tubung was wailing over the body of her dead mother. The group of women advanced in block formation to the coffin, and lifting it to their shoulders carried it into the cemetery. Tubung walked behind wailing. They deposited the coffin by the open grave which had Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="3">The war aw ara malanggan in Lesu 521 previously been dug. The women immediately left the cemetery and stood weeping near the entrance. The men entered, and the body was rather quickly buried, without any special ceremony. Now the men sat around outside in front of the men's house and engaged in desultory conversation. Baked pigs and bundles of taro in the meantime were being carried into the cemetery. Here at one end and by the coffin was the warawara malanggan, made yesterday. In the centre was the large breast ornament, kepkep, and around it was an intricate weaving of different-coloured leaves. The two baked pigs wrapped in leaves were placed in front of the malanggan, and twelve bundles of baked taro in front of them. On one side is the kolamuth [slitgong], which is beaten as the men file into the cemetery (310 f.). Death in Lesu More generally, the handling of death in Lesu was a complex process.4 Here I can only give a con- densed outline of the symbolism surrounding phys- ical death. The imaginary world relating to death was constituted by iconic expositions that stressed the division of society into moieties, as well as alternative counterpoint motifs emphasizing that the main division of society was that between men and women. Discursive symbolism provided various messages about clans and moieties, which were stressed in many activities. The two iconic counterpart motifs functioned as presuppositions for two cultural modalities5 containing radically different views of the world. The first of these possible universes presupposed female dominance, the second male. In its time-dimension, clanship was connected with the future through women's reproductive capacities and the belonging of the future children born to them. Spatially clans were each anchored to a stretch of beach and an expanse of clan land and water. These clan territories were inhabited by certain "totemic" animals - pigs, snakes, sharks - which provided blessings and protection for clan members, but could be threatening to others. The clan territories were also inhabited by an assembly, parallel to human beings, consisting of gas spirits, one alter ego for each clan member. 4 For a somewhat fuller analysis of Lesu death customs based on Powdermaker's ethnography, see Aijmer 2004. 5 "Cultural modality" refers to the possibility of a world being construed as an alternative existence to everyday life, forming another universe. Each such universe has its own presuppositions. Humans do not live in one world only, but in several worlds simultaneously, which exist in parallel (Aijmer 1997:5-9). Continuity over time under male conditions was directed backwards in time, being focused on the dead. Within the male modality, men's procreation of new individuals had been lost and male cre- ativity had ever since been limited to the field of reversed reproduction, in the retrieving of the dead through the carvings of malanggan statues in memorial rituals. The possible world of male pre- suppositions was made manifest in men's houses, cemeteries, and other demarcated ritual grounds, which were exclusively for the use (in life) of the men of both moieties, any possible uterine division being symbolically denied. Women had access to this male realm only in death, when, like the men, they were taken to the men's house and propped up there at its entrance on a bamboo scaffolding for public exhibition. Like the men they were later taken to the graveyard for burial. This place was under male protection and inside its fences living men from both moieties celebrated communions with the dead - men and women - of particular clans, to whom many could not relate themselves at all in the world of discursive uterine kinship arrangements. However, within the space-time of the male cultural modality ruling the cemetery, clan and moiety were irrelevant features. Men married uxorilocally according to the tenets of the female world and were, therefore, generally outsiders where they lived. Burial practices at the time that Powdermaker carried out her fieldwork had developed from an earlier situation when the body was cremated and some of the surviving bones - the vertebrae - were kept in their houses by women related to the dead through uterine kinship. According to early ethnography, crania were kept inside an enclosure; these may well have been those of dead relatives. The warawara as an Artefact The warawara is said to be a malanggan object, but it differed in some important respects from the various classes of carved artefact that were used in memorial rituals. According to Powdermaker's description, the warawara was a product of the moment, apparently being manufactured quickly whenever a death occurred. The carving of the wooden malanggan took many months and was carried out in special carving houses surrounded by great secrecy. The warawara was made, not for a memorial feast, but to be displayed at a funeral - in Powdermaker's day inside the male territory of the fenced-in cemetery. In the particular case I shall discuss here, the exhibition was set up only Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="4">522 Göran Aijmer after the women who had carried the coffin had left the burial ground. We may assume that the piece was on display in the short time that burial guests were present, feasting in the cemetery. Powdermaker tells us that the warawara was made as an "intricate weaving of coloured leaves," but we are not informed about the shape of this particular object, nor its size. The materials used were leaves woven together into a texture. They were of several colours, but there is no more exact description of them, nor do we know whether the colours were mixed or appeared as zones, segments, rings, or spots. Presumably the colours would have been in shades of green, brown, yellow, and red. But then the tropical forest might have supplied some extravaganza here. At the centre of the object was a kepkep, an ornamental disc worn by persons on festive occasions. There were male and female kepkeps, the latter being somewhat smaller in size (201). In the funeral we might assume that the disc of the warawara malanggan was that of the dead woman. The warawara malanggan was a class of ob- jects rather than one particular fixed shape. Pow- dermaker lists no less than thirteen subclass- es of warawara, but tells us no more about how they looked. Their names were Karawas, Azela, Auwafan, Abauurang, Avara, Aflinkabik, Ahmitnas, Wawarapesinganau, Sesoli, Luhkundo, Sauwood, Sulangit and Gawit (316). She also re- ports a myth about warawara' s origin: This myth tells the tale of how some malanggans were being displayed, and the men were eating at a feast for them in the enclosure. They refused to let a fatherless boy (an illegitimate one in our sense) join them because he had no tsera [shell money] and no pig. His mother has no husband from whom he can get them. The boy's mother is sorry for him, and says she will teach him how to make a new malanggan, so she makes the Warawara malanggan. When it is finished she holds a great feast (247). What Powdermaker saw and heard in 1929 were unique observations. No one else reports the name of warawara, but orthography used among ethno- graphers is far from homogeneous. Names for ritual objects may well have changed phonetically once they were incorporated into another local lan- guage. The uniqueness of the name does not mean that the object it designated was unique. We have to look for some likeness or family resemblance between artefacts, and so to possible connections. Earlier ethnographers in this part of New Ireland report on ritual objects that are somewhat similar, in both name and appearance, but there are also differences. Let us consider what the early German ethnologists and museum collectors experienced. Comparative Notes from New Ireland Ethnography Edgar Waiden was a member of the German "Marine-Expedition" to the northern areas of New Ireland and the Tabar Islands in the years 1907- 1909. He visited the Notsi-speaking areas but seems to have been stationed mostly in Fissoa, further north along the coast. His fieldnotes were edited and published in 1940 by Hans Nevermann, and contain some entries of interest for our present concerns. Waiden reports that a man by the name of Luaio in "Logagun" (Lugagon) was in the possession of a number of malanggans, among them one called a vár and another a uáre (Waiden 1940: 21).6 Lu- gagon is situated in the Nalik-speaking area to the northeast of Lesu. With regard to Teripats on Tabar Island, he lists a number of different malanggans in use, among them one called a vavára and an- other vavára. As to the latter, he has this to say: Zum Malagan vavára gehören Schweinezähne, u. a. der Schmuck táumbés oder täumbäs. Er wird beim Tanz auf der Brust getragen, während der Eberzahnschmuck rívo mböro oder bäkuvumbä mböro ein Geschichtsschmuck für den Tanz ist (Waiden 1940: 24). [To the vavára malanggan belong pigs' teeth, among them the decoration táumbés or täumbäs. It is worn on the breast in dancing, while the decoration rivo mböro or bäkuvumbä mböro, made of boar's teeth, is a facial decoration for dancing.] The names a vár and a uáre are fairly close to Powdermaker' s warawara, and also to the subclass called avara. It seems that this vavára was also similar to warawara in that it incorporated in its design a feature similar to the Notsi-area breast pendant or kepkep. The latter was carved from turtle shell rather than pig's teeth. Waiden (1940: 28) reports on yet another object (or perhaps two other objects?) called väfänau and a väfänau, perhaps corresponding to Powdermak- er' s auwafan. His notes come from Lamusmus, which is in the Kara-speaking area even further away from Lesu to the northwest. This smallish 6 Waiden' s transcriptions of local terms and names feature a number of diacritical marks, which are not reproduced here. This may well be distorting, but my purpose is not to be linguistically correct, but to reconstruct an iconic texture.

Warawara type from Lambusso in the Mandak-speaking area (Krämer 1925:67, Abb. 15). malanggan is said to have had a body of rattan and a carved head, but apart from this plaitwork, there is no apparent resemblance with the type that is of interest here, and so I shall not pursue it further. In Fissoa Waiden (28 f.) saw another malang- gan named áuvere, and in Lugagon one called auvára,1 both of which bear some phonetic sim- ilarity to the Notsi avara. Again, this may be a superficial closeness of sound and thus be mislead- ing. With the exception of a central hole, there is nothing in the appearance of these objects which invites further comparison. One of the subclasses of warawara that Pow- dermaker mentions is the sulangit. Hans Never- mann (Waiden 1940: 29) associates this name with Waiden' s α ζΰαχοί, or a zélayot, from Fissoa. There it was pronounced as being a "devil belong Lemamés," the latter being the name of a man long since deceased. This seems to have been a sculptured malanggan, generally depicting a horn billet (Krämer 1925: 75 f.). Even if the phonetic association is correct, the carved object is so dif- ferent from what Powdermaker saw in Lesu that I shall leave this opening unexplored. There were other members of this German "Marine-Expedition" of 1907-1909 to the north- ern areas of New Ireland and the Tabar Islands. A leading person in this endeavour was Augustin Krämer, a man of wide experience of Oceanic research. His base camp was in Lamusong in the 7 Elsewhere, as we have seen above, he mentions two objects in Lugagon as a vár and a uáre. Mandak-speaking area, but he also knew Ambwa and Lesu from shorter visits. Krämer reports on grand ornamental plaited discs in use, which he calls "suns." For what reason they are so labelled remains unclear, and one gains the impression that this is Kramer's own inference, based on their appearance with a concentric, "beaming" construc- tion. He provides no local evidence for the sun designation,8 and in the end it seems that, in the spirit of the times, he was eagerly trying to track a primitive cult of the sun. We may note that Waiden never mentions "sun" malanggans. Kramer's sun objects carry the indigenous name of oâra or, to the south, luára or loára (Krämer 1925: 67), which is reminiscent of Powdermaker' s warawara. The artefacts described by Krämer seem quite elaborate, and from drawings and photographs we can see that the discs were supplied with a "hat" or a "basket" (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). In a general way Krämer describes this feature as follows: Die Hüte (Körbe) sind auf den radiären Strahlen aufge- setzt, die zur Einweihung mit einem grünen, dreikardee- ligen Kranz aus mánganda-FambYàttcrn verziert werden. Schon am Rande sitzt ... ein Körbchen, das vatbós keptú 8 However, he does mention though that in "Lémeris," further to the southwest in the Barok-speaking area, in a ritual use of a plaited disk, a man looked through the centre hole, and this man was given the name king makát which is said to mean "neue Sonne," "new sun." This is not for me to judge. Kramer's interpretation seems to have been accepted in the authoritative account by Derlon (1997a: 80 f., 104, 123, 141, et passim).

"Nest der Strandschnepfe Tringa" genannt wird. Aus ihnen steigen spitz zwei lange, rot und weiß geflochtene Bänder heraus, ventórokop genannt, was "Wasserhose" bedeutet, weil sie nämlich in einem nestartigen Wolken- haufen entsteht; sie setzen sich breit am Korb an. Meist sitzen die Nester aber nicht am Rand, sondern am ersten dunkeln Wulstring, der aus geflochtenen schwarz-wei- ßen Bastzöpfen hergestellt ist und häufig . . . zwischen Stäbchenreihen liegt, die wie Zäune aussehen, besonders wenn noch ein Querstang oben an den Stäbchen umläuft; diese heißen bakanau,9 "Brecher". Gelegentlich ... ist auf dem dunkeln Ring eine helle Linie, der "Schaum" (ë mukút). Dann kommt die Fläche, das Meer (lëmakàt), aus dem mitten die Sonne aufsteigt. Diese besteht aus einem Korbe, várua, in Lámbuso, nach dem breitblättrigen Pandanus benannt, der durch seine spiralige Blätterord- nung diesem Aufbau ähnlich sieht; in Penatnkin sagte man aber dafür vatnbelús, nach einem Baumpilz, den man ja auch damit vergleichen kann. Wie hier die Vergleiche ins Schale gehen, zeigt die Benennung der schwarzen Zungen, die doch sicher Sonnenstrahlen sein 9 Kramer's use of diacritical marks is neglected in this essay. sollen, mit langgambó, "Schweinszungen", der weißen mit gúmbika, "Hahnenkamm"; alles Gelbe nennt man aber gern lúnmanda, nach den reifen Bananen. Der Korb ist innen hohl, und in der Scheibe ist ein Loch, so daß also der Korb keinen Boden hat. Dieses Loch ist sehr wichtig . . . Das Loch heißt in Lémeris le- rnet; das Wort ist uns schon von Panagúndu bekannt, wo es "tote" Jahreszeit . . . bedeutet ... es kann auf den Totenschädel hinweisen oder auf das polynesische mata "Auge"; Penatnkin sagt me remet, was "Totenauge" bedeutete, denn maráng heißt "Auge" in Lámasong . . . ë mara heißt dort aber auch "Loch" . . . daß südwärts Auge katli heißt, und da nun in Lámbuso das Korbloch katli únu genannt wurde ... so ist es sicher, daß Loch und Auge eins sind (Krämer 1925: 68). [The hats (baskets) are put up on the radial beams, which, upon being dedicated, are decorated with a green three- stranded wreath, made of the leaves of mánganda ferns. On the very rim is placed a small basket, which is called vatbós keptú - "nest of the Tiringa snipe." Out of this two long red and white plaited ribbons stand up called ventórokop, meaning "water spouts," as they seem to emerge from a nest-like bank of clouds. They are placed around the basket. For the most part these nests are not placed on the rim, but at the first dark swelling which has been made from twinned bast plaits and often . . . occurs between the rows of small rods; the latter look like fences, particularly when there is another cross-bar which encircles the upper section of the rods; this is called bakanau, "breaker." Occasionally . . . there is a bright line on the darkish ring, the "foam" {ë mukút). Then comes the area - the sea (lëmakàt) - which rises from the middle of the sun. This is constituted by a basket - várua, in Lámbuso - which takes its name from the broad leaves of the Pandanus because its spiral arrangement of leaves shows a similarity to this structure; but in Penatnkin it was called vatnbelús, after a tree mushroom, to which it may also be compared. As the comparison here refers to appearance, it associates the naming of the black tongues - which certainly should be seen as sun beams - with langgambó, pigs' tongues; the white ones are designated gúmbika, "cockscomb." However, everything yellow people like to call lúnman- da after the ripe bananas. The basket is hollow on the inside and on the disc there is a hole so that the basket has no bottom. This hole is very important ... In Léme- ris the hole is called lernet; the word was known to us already in Panagúndu where it means . . . "dead season" ... it may refer to the cranium or to the Polynesian mata - "eye"; Penatnkin people said meremet, which meant "dead eye," as maráng means "eye" in Lámasong . . . but ë mara there also means "hole"; as eye towards the south is called katli, and when now the lid of a basket would be called katli únu in Lámbusi, then it is certain that hole and eye are the same.] This exercise in comparative philology may not be entirely convincing, but the description provides us with possible imaginary associations with the sea, Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="7">The warawara malanggan in Lesu 525 Fig. 3: Display of a warawa- ra type of malanggan. Image drawn in Lamusong (Krämer- Bannow 1916: 207, Bild 110). pigs, Pandanus palm trees, cocks, bananas, eyes, and death. Krämer distinguishes three kinds of oára: kam- balín, makápiko, and bongbongón. These names are certainly in the language of Mandak and they are different phonetically from any of those given to Powdermaker's thirteen subclasses in Notsi. Perhaps there is no relationship at all between these sets of categories. The plaited malanggans described by Krämer appeared in well-prepared rituals, in which respect they were similar to other, carved malanggans, but different from the one apparently made in an impromptu fashion the day before a funeral in Lesu. There are no doubt links between all these "concrete" artefacts, but what they were is as yet not so clear. "Suns" seems a less plausible alternative. Augustin Kramer's wife, Elisabeth Krämer- Bannow, has provided us with yet another descrip- tion, this one localized in the village of Lamusong and a boys' initiation there on 7th April 1909. In a secluded area surrounded by stone walls she saw this (Fig. 3): Da stand in dem sauber gekehrten Hof ein kleines Männerhaus, die Giebelseite dem Eintretenden zuge- wandt, und diese Giebelseite war völlig ausgefüllt von einer großen, in prächtigen Farben erglänzenden Scheibe aus genähtem Flechtwerk, etwa wie ein riesiger Hut, mit offenem, hervortretendem Mittelteil. Der Rand zeigte noch die Stäbe des Gerüstes, die sonnenförmig aus- strahlten und mit seinen Streifen von Farnblättern durch- flochten waren. Die Hauptfarben waren schwefelgelb und weiß mit schmalen, roten Zierstreifen. Dieses auf- fallende Gebilde . . . darf von keiner der Frauen gesehen werden. Dränge eine unbefugt in den Hof, so würde sie erdrosselt, sagte man uns . . . Das Ding entsteht langsam unter mancherlei Festen, Schweine- und Bananenessen, und, kaum zu voller Pracht gediehen, und nur kurze Zeit von den Männern bewundert, wird es den Flammen übergeben zur Ehre dessen, der in diesem Fest verherr- licht werden sollte (Krämer-B anno w 1916: 207 f.). Am nächsten Morgen, dem 9., wurde die große málanggan-Sonne nun doch verbrannt, zusammen mit einigen Andenken des Verstorbenen, dem die Sonne galt, wie Schleuder, Korb, Frauengürtel, einer Matte und anderem (Krämer-Bannow 1916:211). [In the clean, well-swept court there stood a small men's house, its gable facing one as one approached. This gable was completely filled by a large disc of seamed plaitwork, shining in splendid colours; it was a bit like an enormous hat with an open protruding centre. The brim still showed the struts of the framework, which beamed out like a sun, and with stripes of leaves of fern plaited into it. The main colours were sulphur-yellow and white with narrow red ornamental streaks. This striking picture . . . must not be seen by any of the women. Should one of them penetrate into the court without reason, we were told she would be strangled . . . The object emerges slowly under various festivities involving the eating of pork and banana. It has hardly achieved its full splendour and been admired only for a short while by the men, when it is given over to the flames in honour of those who are being celebrated in this feast. On the next morning, the ninth, the grand malanggan sun was now burnt together with some memorabilia of the deceased for whom the sun had been made, like sling, basket, woman's belt, a mat, and other things.] On the next day, 10th April, the Krämers made an excursion to the village of "Penatnkin," where Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="8">526 Göran Aijmer . . . trafen wir einen Mann bei Anfertigung eines Flecht- málanggans, einer Sonne von länglicher Form . . . (Krä- mer-Bannow 1916:212). [. . . we met a man just finishing a wicker-work malang- gan, a sun of oblong form . . .]. In May the same year, they also saw a "Son- nenfest" in Mandak-speaking Lambusso. Here too they noted the fate of the oar a malanggan: ... sie wurde wie jenes Sonnen-Mal an g g an von Lé mer is verbrannt. Sie war zu heilig! (Krämer-Ban- now 1916: 247). [. . . it was burnt like that sun malanggan in Lemeris. It was too sacred!] Powdermaker (1933: 21) comments on these early German attempts to establish traces of a cult of the sun: . . . whether there was in the past a sun cult, as some German writers believe, is difficult to ascertain. Certain rituals, such as that connected with the malanggans . . . seem to have lost much of their original meaning. But without the thesis of a sun cult, gathered from other areas, it does not seem to me that one would, from the present data, connect this ritual with the sun. The connection is decidedly too hypothetical to be termed historical. William C. Groves did fieldwork on the nearby Tabar Islands for seven months in 1933. He men- tions a malanggan by the name of wawara, which type he says was much favoured in Tabar (Groves 1935: 361), and which he describes as a variety of circular woven mat . . . decorated with a spider's web design and painted . . . wawara mats are set up in a traditional way with much associated ritual under a specially constructed "house" inside the mortuary enclosure, generally above the actual burial places of the individuals, in whose commemoration the rites are ostensibly being conducted (1935: 355). He goes on to explain: ... the one called wawara, which is said to have originated in New Ireland, and been adopted into Tabar Islands . . . Wawara is woven of split cane like a spider- web. Its origin is accounted for by an interesting legend universally known and believed. Because it differs in form from all other types [of malanggan] and because of its peculiar and separate origin, wawara is hedged round with special precautionary rites. For example, the actual weaving and setting up of the figures are done in strictest secrecy. Anyone but recognized wawara specialists who looks upon or touches wawara during its preparation is certain to suffer personal harm. Any of the wawara fellowship who makes a slip or an error in the form of the rites or in the spells used during the lengthy and involved procedure will also meet with personal disaster. No man working on wawara dare go shark-snaring while he is engaged in the procedure, for the sharks would "smell" him, and cause disaster to befall the expedition (1936: 238 f.).10 Groves (1936: 240 f.) describes how the prepa- rations were done in a special, small, highly- protected, secret enclosure within the ordinary ma- langgan enclosure. Here there was a low ceiling under which, in full isolation, three or four spe- cialists weaved the cane material into a finished pattern. He tells how spells were said over every bit of material used and accompanied every phase of the activities. Whereas other malanggans were allowed to decay in the forest following the cere- monies at which they were used, a wawara would be immediately destroyed and burnt. This took place at the back of the enclosure, where people otherwise never went. He describes the men taking part in these rituals, their body paintings and also in some detail the cremation of the wawaras. He also has something to say on the place of women in this ritual sequence: Food is prepared for them [the constructors of the wawara] only by their own wives, or by married women of their local group who are concerned with them in the conduct of the wawara cycle. These women are also under a strict obligation not to misconduct themselves in any way during the time of preparation. If they do so, they must openly discontinue their part in preparing the food, for otherwise harm will surely come to the group of wawara specialists themselves (1936: 239). We must not neglect work that was conducted in Lesu subsequently. The fieldwork of Phillip H. Lewis was devoted to expressive art and carried out there for seven months in 1953-54 (Lewis 1969: 11). In between Powdermaker's and Lewis's periods in Lesu, New Ireland had been involved in the Pacific War, occupied by the Japanese and thoroughly Christianized. Still Lewis found a great deal of malanggan activities. He made a number of observations on one type called wowora, which are of interest here: 10 Groves claims, as his informants did, that the wawara was a new import into the Tabar Islands and had not been used there for long (1936: 238). Despite this, and with no further comment, Küchler (2002: 131) claims that it originated in Tabar. In this essay I am not so interested in origins. Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="9">The warawara malanggan in Lesu 527 Two malanggan objects called Wowora were made in the period of about a month before March 10, at an uninhabited place called Kabil, located between Libba and Nou . . . Actual construction of the two Wowora objects began a day or so before February 17, 1954, and both were finished for use in the March 10 ceremonies. ... the two objects were circular disks. The carving which formed the center piece of the smaller one was carved by Samari. It was an elliptically shaped piece of wood, 12 inches long by 9 inches wide and about 2 inches thick. The part to be seen from the front was carved to represent a face, with the mouth in relief, and a hole going right through to the back, and with eyes and nose rising from the mouth ... By means of lashings going through the holes bored around the edges of the piece of wood, the carving was attached to the disk itself, which was formed of splints of rattan called tunin, or "bones," bound to a coiled mat made of a spiral of braided fiber. When shown on March 10, a ring of white feathers covered the holes in the wood and lashings, and also a carved wooden mouth ornament was placed in the mouth. The large disk (42 1/2 inches in diameter) was made differently. Instead of a carved and painted wooden relief sculpture in the center, a cylindrical form, about 11 inches in diameter and about 6 inches deep, was worked into the center so that it projected forward from the plane of the disk. On March 10, when displayed, a "kep kep" was placed on the flat surface of this projecting cylinder . . . Both disks were painted with red, yellow, and white paint, except for the bands made of the naturally black aerial root, and the carved face which was painted in blue, white, and red. The paint used on the braided coils was heavily loaded with white lime, which resulted in a thick plastered effect (Lewis 1969: 99-101). Lewis notes further that of all the malanggans he saw in 1954, the wowora seemed most hedged around with secrecy. He also observed that these discs were used as other malanggan objects. They were set up in a display hut where they were viewed by people and treated in the same way as sculptured malanggans. The two discs he mentions were set up in the same display hut. As was said earlier regarding the large disc, he notes that, when displayed, a kepkep was placed on the flat surface of the projecting cylinder (1969: 101). The display mentioned was connected with the initiation of boys, but for whom the two wowora had been made was not entirely clear. Nor did it transpire which deceased person, if any, was being honoured by these objects. He mentions that the name of one of the objects was Pulado (1969: 101, 103). Among other things relevant for the understanding of the wawara, he provides one mythic tale that explained its origin (1969: 103): Kuli was an unmarried woman who had no genitals. However, she had two children, and she tried to have them initiated in the enclosure. They were chased away because they had no father. Kuli went to fetch some water and there, saw a spider. An idea came to her. She tells her children, tomorrow you and I will go to the white fiber called raramgo and put it in the water. The children do this. The men said, these children have no father and no malanggans. Where will they get one? The woman talks, says that tomorrow they will sit in the enclosure. She braids the vine, fastens it to the wood, then beats it flat. She then makes the Wowora, and asks them all to erect a coconut leaf enclosure. Once there were only wooden malanggans. Wowora malanggans originated with this woman. Wowora are not from long ago. The slit gong cries out, and all the men chide her. The woman has houses made. All the men come. The day for erecting the malanggans comes. They all come to look. The sight of the Wowora closes their mouths. From then on, everyone has used Wowora, paying the original owners. There was at this time also a more general view reported thus: Lesu and Libba informants said that Wowora were spirits of deceased persons, that they were dangerous, in that they caused sores, that a person must not garden just after being involved with Wowora. When eaten, ginger is thought to ward off evil effects of Wowora (Lewis 1969: 103). It is now time to return to the initial fragment of ethnography provided by Powdermaker. The warawara she describes occurred at a funeral and was, it seems, a somewhat improvised artefact made the day before and placed in the enclosed cemetery. This kind of exposure is not mentioned anywhere else in the ethnography from the early decades of the last century that we have reviewed here. It must be emphasized again that the fact that warawara or similar woven discs were used in many places on the northeast coast of New Ireland - and also elsewhere - does not imply that they were everywhere exactly the same or that similar- ity in appearance implied similar ritual treatment. There is no a priori principle here according to which the historical material can be read in union across the area or the various ethnographic bits of information made to illuminate one another in decisive ways. There were certainly historical connections between these locations. Cults and artefacts in New Ireland, as in other areas of this part of Melanesia, were purchased and so spread through the dynamics of ostentatious leadership. Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="10">528 Göran Aijmer But we must also understand that this had been a long-term process reaching far into unknown his- tory and that each place and language area would fairly have developed their own ideas about such circulating designs for artefacts and blueprints for rituals, which would not be exactly what was taught and learnt when a cult was purchased. What we can hope for is a degree of family resemblance between the various examples that we are trying to understand here. Similarities may be fragmented and lack systematic integration, but they might still tell something - shared proper- ties in these artefacts and their surrounding rit- uals could still function as pointers. A tentative anthropological image - a simile of the "original" warawara - might be constructed for our further contemplation. This anthropological construct will bear, it is hoped, some consonance with how, a long time ago, the inhabitants of Lesu understood and intuited their own imagery. One thing must be considered here. The Lesu warawara made in an impromptu fashion at death might have been a temporary device to repair the failure of some other rituals that were then lost, an upheaval relating to missionary activities or some other outside force. Powdermaker does not mention this possibility, and as other malanggan activities seem to have been in full swing in the late 1920s, it would seem reasonable to accept the Lesu usage here as something conventional and expected, rather than some improvised invention to beat the missionary. We must remember, though, that Lesu death rituals had already undergone important changes by this time, so the position of the warawara may have been in tune with ongoing adjustments. Such possibilities must not interfere with our present analysis, as we are looking beyond possible changes in premodern conditions of this sort. The kepkep It was noted in the previous pages that the warawa- ra was connected with - in a way partly constituted by - a carved disc named a kepkep. It even seems as if the warawara was centred on the disc, being constructed around it so to give emphasis and intensity to the display of this personal belonging of the dead. We must see what can be learnt about this sort of disc. Powdermaker' s material on the kepkep and their use is far from extensive. We learn something about the objects themselves. They were breast ornaments and were carved from turtle shell, that Fig. 4: Kepkep from northwestern New Ireland. Carved turtle shell against a circular mussel shell disc (Krämer-Bannow 1916:116, Bild 59). is, "the design on the breast ornament" (156). The back shell of the turtle (kukulsum) was smeared inside with lime (last) and left in the sun to dry (184). The carving of kepkep ornaments is listed as a masculine occupation (163). Turtle shell work was confined to a few and was done with a knife, where formerly it had been done with a stone (190). As already mentioned, there were large kepkep worn by men and small kepkep worn by women (201). The pattern carved was sometimes strikingly similar to that of a disc malanggan (see Fig. 4). We are not too well informed about the use of such breast ornaments. We know that they were worn by women while dancing at boys' initiation rituals (107). At the same initiation festivities when the malanggan was displayed, men performed dances in which they appeared as bird-like spirits and wore kepkeps. It should be added that this sort of ornamental disc was widely used in the area, for instance on New Britain (Brown 1910: plate facing p. 316). The kepkeps were clearly more than ornaments, and something of their iconic force is brought for- ward in two mythical accounts, narrations in which the kepkep seems to appear with a transcendental message. One such myth tells of a young boy who has been lured by a woman to break the seclusion of an initiation ritual, and, as a result, commits ritual suicide: Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="11">The warawara malanggan in Lesu 529 He was very angry, and putting his biuk [armband] on his arm, his kepkep on his breast, and some bird's feathers in his hair, he beat the kolamuth (hollowed tree-trunk used as a drum) and then put fire inside of it (115). He burns to death inside the blazing kolamuth slit- gong. The other narration that features the breast ornament is set in intervillage strife in the days when Tagam and Lesu were still separate, mutu- ally hostile villages. Before the days of German government, the hamlets of Lesu in fact formed two different villages. The six hamlets to the north were known as the village of Tagam, the remaining nine hamlets being the village of Lesu. Each had its own "chief," and there was constant fighting between the two (32). The Tagam people had fled in response to a Lesu attack, but an attempt at peacemaking had eventually brought them back. Faith in peace was apparently somewhat prema- ture, and the story continues: The day after their return the Tagam people went to their gardens in the bush, but their chief, Seiut, stayed home in order to make a kepkep . . . [the Lesu people] came to his house and said that they would like to watch him work on the kepkep. He invited them in, and they killed him by cutting his head open and slashing his body (42). These fragmentary pieces of evidence provide at least some vague guidelines for our understanding of the kepkep ornaments. They clearly connoted death: a kepkep was the centrepiece in the warawa- ra malanggan', it was donned at a mythical suicide in fire, in which the suicide candidate was dressed up very like the dancing image of a spirit in being bird-like with feathers; furthermore, it was being carved by a man who was then slain by intruding outsiders. In the last narrative we find a "chief alone in a village carving a kepkep ornament. It seems that the legitimizing factor in his murder was that he had allowed the intruders to watch his work. The meaning here may be that the work on the kepkep was secret and should remain hidden from visitors from another village. As already noted, the kepkeps were used ritually in the drama when the spirit figures open the initiation dancing. This suggests that the breast ornament formed a link with the world of spirits. Men and women wore kepkep alike, although there was a difference in size, men's being larger. The warawara malanggan seems to have been special, or at least unusual, in that it activated kep- kep symbolism in the malanggan itself. Whether the kepkep was destroyed, being perhaps burnt, with the malanggan after the display in a ritual event, is not known. Nor do we know the individ- ual fates of these turtle shell carvings, assuming that they were in fact saved. Were they inherited in some order of succession in cases of death, or were they destroyed? Having associations with life, death, and spirits, it would be revealing to know what their fates were in the longer time perspective. But we are not fortunate enough to have such information (see further Derlon 1997b). The Wider New Ireland View A few things could be said, I think, on the basis of the scraps of New Ireland historical ethnography that we have. The main feature in the warawara type of malanggan is a central hole, suggesting some sort of implicit passage through the object. Holes also occurred in some carved malanggans, but in the warawara the hole seems to have been essential - the object was a hole. The opening was dramatized in several ways, sometimes with a carved, grotesque, gaping face suggesting passage through a strange mouth. On other occasions the hole was elaborated into a pipe or a hose surround- ed by colourful petal-like decorations. Powder- maker's note suggests that the purpose of the open- ing was to receive the kepkep disc. The surround- ing plaitwork seems to have been a kind of frame for the dead person's kepkep. This need not mean that the idea of a passage gave way here to a static arrangement allowing the watching men to concen- trate on the carved disc. Rather, I would suggest, it meant that the person represented or manifested by his or her kepkep was in that passage. The plaitwork surrounding the hole was always round or oval. The fibre material was plaited with the help of a number of concentrically arranged spines and was described as colourful, making the artefacts ostentatious. The warawara had a decidedly female conno- tation. Myths from Lesu and Tabar mentioned in condensed outline the fact that one or several boys could not be received at the men's ground, as they did not have fathers and, therefore, could not provide any prestations. The mother, having no genitals, seems to have born her children through some form of parthenogenesis. The mother set out to use forest materials to create her own malang- gan with its own cult, basing the design on a spi- der's web.11 The men incorporated the warawara 11 Küchler (2002: 132 f.) recounts a modern version of this story from the island of Tatau off the west coast. Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="12">530 Göran Aijmer into their ritual sphere. Also, it is mentioned that women still had an indirectly important part in the construction of new warawaras. The warawa- ra stood in some contrast to carved malanggans, but the rituals surrounding it seem to have been fairly similar and parallel, with seclusion, secrecy, and the exclusion of women as strong ingredients. Whereas the carved memorial sculptures were left to decay at the back of the men's ground after the conclusion of the ritual, the warawara was like a dead body at an old-style funeral, being burnt or "cremated" as soon as it had been ritually consumed. It was regarded as dangerous and had to be treated with great care. Names for ornamental details of the plaited discs are reported to have had names drawn from maritime features, but these could well be dis- cursive comments associating design features with natural features. At this stage it seems difficult to systematize such labels into a meaningful reading. There is hardly any more information available in the early ethnography, which would allow us to reason or speculate further about these remarkable objects. The main conclusion is that, as we know through the myth, the warawara was associated with female descent in pure fatherless lines of uterine kinship. It should have been associated with clanship and the destruction of individuals through cremation at death. Like other artefacts in the more general sphere of malanggan activities, it had strong associations with death and was in- strumental in building the fate of a dead person. There may be further clues, as yet not understood, in these early pieces of Lesu and New Ireland ethnography, but if we are inclined to search for some sort of reasonably systemic anthropological interpretation, we have the alternative of approach- ing the material indirectly, through comparison and suggestions brought out by the broader per- spective. To try this possibility, let us turn to the nearby Duke of York Islands. Some Features of Duke of York Ethnography In the Duke of York Islands, the local death cycle formed a series of ritual episodes which concerned sets of recently deceased people, who were made to leave the world of the living for good.12 The sequence of mortuary rituals involved the use of anthropomorphic conical masks with skirts of leaves. It featured the short life span of at least one female tubuan masked figure or, perhaps 12 This outline provides a very brief account of Aijmer 1997. more often, one or several tubuans, together with a number of male masks called dukduk. Within this sequence of ritual episodes, the masks were born, performed their duty in this world, and then died. The village formed the basic ritual arena for the staging and carrying out of a death feast. The cemetery and the beach were also important, but the main focus was definitely on the village. The final phase in a person's life course, in which he or she was ultimately finished off after death, was linked to the female sphere, which was the village. Moreover, the female tubuan mask was necessary to accomplish this definite parting from life. The tubuan was controlled by a man who, by acquiring secret knowledge, had turned female, an ambiguous "adept" who replaced the original primordial female ownership of the tubuan. The mask was an ancestress linked to both notions of moiety division and female-orientated kinship. The first task of the tubuan mask was to collect the dead from where they were in the cemetery and to bring them back to the village, where they were placed on a particular ceremonial stand. In later times, the vehicle used for their transport was the dracaena plant, which replaced the traditionally used skull of the dead as a marker of his or her actual presence on the ceremonial stand. When living men and women and the dead were together in the village in unity, the scene was set for the finishing of the dead. The village, seen as a symbolic arena, was dominated by imagery which endowed the ruling supremacy of the cultural modality of women, women's procreation and uterine kinship. The ancient dead were present in the form of masks, the recent dead in the personal relics placed on a ceremonial stand. Another presence of the aggregated dead of former times was in the rolls of shell money which were placed on that stand - a kind of collective manifestation of ancestry. The earlier ethnography tells us that outsiders from other villages and islands, visiting Big Men, were those who bravely carried off the dead, brought them outside the community boundaries, and let them disappear. The recently dead were now definitely completed and gone. At some point in time, this ritual activity seems to be have been transformed into a ritual event in which the tubuan mask was the figure which incorporated the dead into her body and carried them away, again out of the community, to be properly finished. This was the high point of the long ritual death cycle. After the dead had been removed from the village area, the masks also had to be removed. There were two liturgical routes to achieving this, Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="13">The warawara malanggan in Lesu 531 which were separated in time, though their dif- ference was structural and referred to the twofold aspect of cultural modalities. The first procedure was valid in the male modality. Here the masks were invited to a festive meal, which was then divided into two separate sittings. The spirits that animated the tubuan masks went into the forest to partake of their share there, while at the same time the remaining empty masks were attacked and killed by wringing their necks. The spirits had been displaced and could not return. The second liturgical path was linked with the female modality. Instead of luring the spirits into the forest and destroying the then harmless masks, the final ceremony took place in the village, where the masks were not killed at all but died a natural death in yet another public display, appearing in the village to die of old age, while the women lamented. Their exit from this world was through the cemetery. The ritual message of this display was associated with the female presupposition that the tubuan gives birth to the dukduk. The latter male masks were brought into this world by female birth (rather than male creation), and like human beings they passed away through natural death. Natural death was female death - violent killing male death. In a continuation of the first ritual episode, which implicated the men as the killers of the masks, the latter were dismantled and symboli- cally disposed of, the tubuan in the forest and the dukduk in the sea. Female ancestresses were returned to the woods, male ancestors to the sea - pre-Christian burial was generally performed by sinking the corpse into the lagoon. Masks, Discs, and Men The suggestion offered here is that the tubuan and dukduk activities on the Duke of York Islands had a strong structural congruence with the ma- langgan operations in New Ireland. Between the two areas there was a shared grammar of iconic compositions, although the symbolic vocabularies used in the building of imagery in the two places were quite different. It should be pointed out that tubuan and dukduk masks are also made on southern New Ireland, not so far from Lesu (Albert 1988; Kingston 2003). This might seem like one of the occasions where there is reason to question the epistemology of the anthropological impulse. The modest ambition here is to bring some order to some very elusive material. Controlled comparison may well be of use in a tentative exploration to provide us with a sense of direction. The hypothesis I am putting forward here is that the Lesu production of carved malanggan sculpture was of an order analogous to the dukduk masks and their construction. I would also maintain that, structurally speaking, the warawara type of ritual objects corresponded closely to the tubuan mask. The focus in this essay on the warawara leaves no scope to penetrate the complex world of carved malanggans. Therefore some brief remarks must suffice, which are only intended as pointers and temporary suggestions. Although individual pat- terns and shapes could be classified as male or female, carved objects were very much part of the male sphere. They originated in the dreams of men, were carved in great secrecy, displayed in seclusion, and seldom, if ever, allowed to be inspected by women. At a memorial feast a dead person, or a set of deceased men and women, was incorporated into a sculpture which, after being displayed in the male ground for a short period in connection with some major ritual, was brought to a place in the forest, where it was left, now and henceforth irrelevant, to decay. One point here is that, on staging a death memo- rial, the ritual manager had to buy a copyrighted pattern from a foreign place for the malanggan to be carved in order to celebrate the dead. This striking feature meant that the dead who had earlier been incorporated into that particular pattern were now exported to an outside realm and so definitely finished and made extraneous with regard to their progeny. Generally, it seems, the same pattern could not be recycled in the same place. The dead were temporarily tied to a certain pattern, which could be realized in token sculptures. Male creativ- ity was orientated backwards in time as a retrieval of the past - it was a matter of recreation, of the reshaping of the dead out of death, giving them a temporary new existence in the mundane world by male demiurgical generation. It was men who retrieved the dead as sculptured figures. The fate of the carved malanggan was physical decomposition in the forest (or, in later times, to be a collector's item), while their ethereal part was exported with the pattern at a future point in time. One possibility here is that the dead, who the last time that partic- ular malanggan was used were incorporated into the sculpture and its named pattern, were recreated anew in a foreign environment, possibly to be appropriated in some way there. They were then replaced by deceased persons from the new com- munity, by their dead, who now became in their turn, candidates for a coming removal. The dead Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="14">532 Goran Aijmer circulated among communities. This was similar to the Duke of York Islands where the dead were exported by means of foreign visitors who brought them out of the community in a dramatic and prestigious move. This interpretation is no doubt bold - to some minds perhaps even dubious - because of a lack of substantial data, but it does carry a degree of credibility from the structural parallel with the Duke of York Islands. There is, to the best of my knowledge, nothing to contradict these somewhat speculative assumptions. The warawara type of malanggan was clearly of female nature and originally the creation of a woman. Also in this case, the individual patterns might discursively be called female or male, but the essence of the category of objects we are deal- ing with here was clearly femininity. The mythical tales note that the first warawara was created by a woman for her fatherless sons who were denied access to the men's realm, as they could not pro- vide the necessary fatherly prestations. This wom- an typifies uterine descent, she generates children without a man - she has no genitals. Her children are of a pure, self-generating female force. She offers her son an alternative malanggan, proceed- ing in accordance with the requirements for the manufacture of a carved figure. But she uses fibres and plaitwork, which are formed around a central hole or passage, the whole taking on an oval or circular shape. This sexless woman seems to be constructing her own genitals and, in displaying the result, is opening up a cultural modality of female presuppositions for public inspection. The warawara genitals epitomized women's generative power and a realm of uterine belonging where men were irrelevant for the continuity of soci- ety. Carved figures were part of the male world - the men's house, the male ground and the sea. In this male world, moiety and the grammar of motherhood were irrelevant and even denied. But outside this male cultural modality, fatherhood was a social-ritual construct and biologically unfound- ed.13 The warawara plaitwork belonged to the female world of the forest, the house, and the settlement.14 The ritual narrative of the myth tells how men confronted with the female answer to 13 Sexual promiscuity (but always respecting moiety incest) was normal, and biological fathers were not known. See Powdermaker (1933: 244). 14 Küchler (2002: 133) claims that today - and unlike carved malanggans - "warwara" discs are rooted and not mobile. Projected backwards in time, this proposition would also make a lot of sense in the historical context we are discussing here. their exclusiveness, usurped and incorporated the warawara into their own set of rituals, henceforth forbidding women to have anything to do with it. Still, the ethnography reports that in some places women continued to have a special place with re- gard to warawara rituals. The male theft of a major symbol of creative femininity in the Notsi area and elsewhere in New Ireland seems to correspond well to the male conquest of the tubuan mask in the Duke of York Islands, where the ultimate origin of this female figure was the women's world. In both places, mythical-ritual articulation tells how the male cultural modality deals with the threats that come from the female world. The warawara as an Icon We are now somewhat better equipped to under- stand the early ethnography that we have explored in this essay, starting from of Hortense Powder- maker's report from the late 1920s. A rereading of the available data will provide us with the following picture. In Lesu the warawara was made the day before the funeral and displayed in the cemetery. The ethnography is not altogether clear here. We learn that once the women who carried the coffin had placed it by the grave, they left the cemetery. The men entered and completed the burial without ceremony. Then baked pigs and bundles of taro were brought into the cemetery. It is said that the warawara was by the coffin and that this ought to be read as "by the now buried coffin." The two pigs were placed in front of the ma- langgan and in front of the pigs were twelve bundles of baked taro. A slitgong placed to one side was sounded. The warawara made for the dead woman was equipped with a kepkep disc, probably that of the deceased. The pigs and taro of the display might both have had associations with the forest and the female domain. Taro expressed female order, clanship, and moiety on several occasions (see further Aijmer 2004). Pigs may have been somewhat more ambiguous, but we cannot explore this further here. What was seen and inspected in the enclosure that served as a cemetery at the time was a manifestation of the dead, the kepkep, placed in the passage of the female malanggan, either being absorbed through it into the collective uterus of the clan, or being born through a clan vagina into some sort of new transcendental existence. We may hypothesize that, whereas the carved malanggans exported the dead in accordance with the tenets Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="15">The warawara malanggan in Lesu 533 of the male modality, the wickerwork malanggans kept the dead within the uterine clan and the female territory. These basically female mysteries were handled by men, who had monopolized the mortuary ritual sphere, but, and ironically, were forced to handle what to them were alien and ultimately unknown symbolic truths.15 Cemeteries were new to Lesu. Previously corps- es had been cremated on the beach, only some of the vertebrae being saved by the women and taken by them to their houses. Possibly crania were also kept, but then by the men in the men's ground. It seems likely, then, that in that period the warawara displays were not part of the funeral, but featured in some memorial ritual at a later point in time. Whether they then mingled with other, carved malanggans on the occasion is not known. The main point suggested here is that the two kinds of malanggan were complementary, each handling a different aspect of the dead, each relating to one of two cultural modalities. In this light, and as a side-thought, the wa- rawara type of objects could not be said to be "concrete" objects, as was suggested earlier, with- out any direct reference to the phenomena of the world. Rather they seem to depict abstractly, being transformed representations of the female genitals. As is typical of this part of Melanesia, there was no exegesis concerning these objects, apart from mythical tales about their origins. The iconology spoke for itself, its motifs being intuited with- out any further discursive commentary. There is reason to believe that these objects, their shape and colours, were striking - perhaps beautiful - to those who constructed them and to those who saw them. The engagement people had with the wa- rawara would have given them aesthetic pleasure, but this gratification would no doubt have included their intuitive understanding that shape and colour contained an essential existential truth. The cre- ative spirit of ritualistic artists in Lesu, the Notsi- speaking area, and elsewhere in northwestern New Ireland would have combined and synthesized the realistic truth of death, the discourses articulating power and legitimacy, the strategies of secrecy and the fulfilment of expressive convention with an in- sight into iconic veracity. Without that cognizance there would be no aesthetics.
