<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENTO- MOPHILOUS PLANTS AND ANTHOPHILOUS INSECTS' E. E. LEPPIK 2 The Hormel Institute of the University of Minnesota, Austin, Minnesota Received April 4, 1957 Most students of floral ecology and in- sect behavior agree today that bees and flowers are closely and mutually inter- related in evolution as reciprocal selective factors (Frisch, 1950, 1954; Grant, 1949; Schneirla, 1951; Butler, 1954, p. 6). But neither the evolution of flower types to their present perfection of colors and symmetry, nor the sensory development of insect pollinators, which might have caused the gradual floral differentiation, are yet satisfactorily explained. So far, no attempt has been made to present theo- ries or speculations on how the flowering plants, which form the main part of the vegetation on earth, have come to be as we see them today. Almost all recent writers hold the view that the evolution of the flowering plants is still as great a mystery as ever (Just, 1952; Good, 1956; Thomas, 1956). It is urgently important, therefore, to explore the expected parallel- ism between the development of flowers and of insects, and to establish its evo- lutionary significance. 1 Much of the material used in this report was collected by the writer while working at the Tropical Research Institute of the University of El Salvador in Central America during the years 1953 and 1954. Dr. Aristides Palacios, Director General, and Dr. Adolf Meyer-Abich, Constitu- ent Member of this Institute, helped the author to solve many technical problems during this study. Dr. Th. Just, Chief Curator of the Chicago Natural History Museum, helped the author in discussing many problems of this study. Miss Karen M. Heyerdahl, Principal Secretary of the Hormel Institute, assisted in the preparation of the manuscript. 2 Present address: Iowa State College, De- partment of Botany and Plant Pathology, Plant Introduction Station, Ames, Iowa. In some earlier papers (Leppik, 1948a, 1956), an attempt was made to arrange some directly observable tendencies and trends in floral differentiation into a his- torical sequence, which would mirror, ac- cording to the present theory, the main trend of the accelerated evolution of en- tomophilous angiosperms. A new idea, to be discussed in this article, concerns a conjectural sensory mechanism which governs the tropheclectic behavior of an- thophilous insects, and coordinates their selective activity among fast-evolving flower types. Recent investigations sug- gest that this conjectural mechanism (or mechanisms) has been established in in- sects step by step during their sensory evolution, and is functioning now as the principal determining factor for floral differentiation (Leppik, 1956, 1957a). ABILITY OF POLLINATING INSECTS TO DISTINGUISH FLOWER TYPES The long-lasting debate among biolo- gists as to whether colors or scents attract pollinators has finally been resolved by ex- perimental findings which indicate that bees have both a keen sense of color and a sharp perception of odor. In addition, the color sense of insects has been found to be supplemented by an accurate perception of form and symmetry (Frisch, 1914; Hertz, 1929; Leppik, 1953b, 1954; Kug- ler, 1955, p. 104-107). There is further evidence and consider- able experimental proof that at least hy- menopterous pollinators are able to dis- tinguish third dimensions and forms of bi- lateral symmetry. In this respect the bumblebees have been more fully studied, EVOLUTION 11: 466-481. December, 1957. 466</page><page sequence="2">RELATIONSHIP OF PLANTS AND INSECTS 467 and are known to possess a keen visual perception of form and depth (Kugler, 1942, 1943, 1955; Werth, 1949, 1956). These insects have also a special liking for stereomorphic and zygomorphic forms of so-called "bumblebee flowers," which plants have almost the same geographical distribution as bumblebees. The ability of insect pollinators to distinguish form and symmetry is further mirrored in their steadfastness to definite flower types, as described below. A further remarkable capability of some groups of pollinators to recognize and re- member numeral patterns in flowers is discussed elsewhere (Leppik, 1948a, 1953b, 1954, 1955c, 1957b). There are at least thirteen basic combinations of numbers that certain groups of pollinators can recognize and remember as definite symmetrical patterns: many, few, single, five radial, five bilateral, four radial, four bilateral, three, two, six, eight, ten, and twelve. In nature, insects encounter these "figure numerals" regularly as tri-, bi-, tetra-, penta-, hexa- and polymerous types among pleomorphic 3 and stereomorphic flowers. Being conditioned to these basic numeral patterns and remembering their size, color, and frequently also odor, a "literate," let us say, pollinator can easily distinguish his nectar plants from hun- dreds of flower types displayed to him in a landscape and in a foraging area. The ability of insects to distinguish the above- described numeral patterns is evidenced so far by experiments, special tests, and field observations in honeybees, stingless wild bees (Melaponidae) and several tropical butterflies (Leppik, 1954, 1956). It should be noted here that in this se- 3Amorphic flowers are primitive clusters of discolored leaves, without particular form. Haplomorphic types are semispherical forms like Magnolia and Water-lily. Actinomorphic types have radiate symmetry. Pleomorphic type class includes bi-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, octo- and oligomorphic forms, with distinctive figure numerals in flowers. Stereomorphic flowers have three-dimensional structure and zygo- morphic flowers have bilateral symmetry (Lep- pik, 1956, p. 256). quence of "figure numerals," numbers 7, 9, and 13 are absent. Obviously, such combinations, which cannot be arranged symmetrically so that they could be easily distinguished visually without counting, are not perceptible to insects. Plants, obedient to their insect "breeders" only very infrequently hold such "nude" num- bers in their flowers. Consequently, the numeral system of insects, in spite of its broad applicability to hundreds of com- binations, differs basically from all known numeral systems of man (Leppik, 1956). The fact that certain plant species, or even varieties, are discernible to pollinat- ing insects has been known at least since Aristotle (see transl. 1910) and is re- peatedly confirmed by appropriate experi- ments (see Grant, 1950b; Bateman, 1951; Leppik, 1951, 1954, 1955a; Werth, 1956; and others). But we cannot expect from insects such taxonomic knowledge in the anthropomorphic sense, as is sometimes erroneously indicated. Mather (1947) has good reason to argue that there is a range of similarity between forms at and below the specific levels, over which dis- crimination by the bees is absent or im- perfectly developed. Actually, insects are neither capable of identifying plant species as taxonomic units in our sense, nor of discriminating interspecific and intervarietal groups of plants. Our taxonomic classification and species identification is based upon the phylogenetic relationships among plants, which are unknown to insects. But an- thophilous insects do recognize their food plants as definite "flower types," no mat- ter whether these types embrace species, genera, varieties, or other taxonomic units. In nature, these types most abundantly coincide with definite species, less fre- quently with varieties or genera, leading observers sometimes to the erroneous idea that insects are capable of interspecific and intervarietal discrimination of plants. Floral ecologists have often shown that when two or more distinct species bear- ing the same type of flower are planted on</page><page sequence="3">468 E. E. LEPPIK the same bed, pollinators will intermingle these species. From all these facts and arguments, it can be concluded that a flower is recog- nized by insects as a whole, which means more than a mere sum of all characteris- tics such as color, form, number of flower parts, size, and odor. In experiments, however, honeybees, wild bees, and wasps learn quickly to locate sugar syrup ac- cording to a single characteristic, such as color or odor. In nature, on the contrary, pollinators rarely encounter such simple combinations of floral characteristics. Flowers are not just formless colored or odorous spots on green vegetation, but rather, represent the finest combinations of colors, form, and symmetry. None- theless, every single flower type, if consid- ered as a whole, is clearly distinguishable even from a considerable distance. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that from a distant view, a flower group appears as a colored patch that helps the pollinators to locate a foraging area. Upon reaching the area, the pollinators stay close enough to distinguish one flower type from an- other. Bees decide quickly which flower to choose, and then inspect each flower very closely, possibly to determine odor, nectar guides, and other special charac- teristics. Butterflies, on the contrary, spend considerable time in the air before descending to some single flower. THE ROLE OF POLLINATING INSECTS IN THE EVOLUTION OF FLOWER TYPES Much new information has accumulated during the past decades on the selective ability and activity of pollinating insects among flower types. In this brief re- view, however, no effort is made at com- plete coverage of literature in question (see Koelreuter, 1761; Darwin, 1862; Mueller, 1876; Loew, 1884; Lovell, 1918; Small, 1919; Kugler, 1942, 1943, 1955; Werth, 1956, Hodges, 1952, 1955). Nor can the genetic approach to the problem, as promoted by Stebbins (1950), Grant (1949, 1950, 1952), Mather (1947, 1951), Bateman (1947, 1951), Straw (1955, 1956), and others, be discussed at length. Main emphasis will be placed on the evalu- ation of the newest research records on the evolutionary corelation between insects and flowers, as described elsewhere (Lep- pik, 1955a, 1956, 1957a, b). Recent investigations suggest that two types of selection are performed by in- sects among flowers. First they choose the most promising and structurally ac- cessible flower type for their permanent visits. Dancing honeybees recruit other fellow workers to their previously selected plant species and soon the whole bee colony is steadfast4 to the same flower type in a foraging area. Bees, bumble- bees, and other specialized, mentally more developed pollinators ordinarily prefer plants of higher evolutionary levels, like legume plants and composites, and turn to lower flowering plants mainly in the case of food scarcity. Having once made their choice, steadfast pollinators remain long faithful to a single flower species, favoring a particular ethological isolation (Grant, 1949, 1950a, b) of certain types from one another. Such intraspecific se- lection and subsequent isolation must be an obvious advantage for the seed pro- duction and rapid expansion of certain se- lected species. A second type of selection is performed by pollinating insects among varieties and ecotypes of the same species, provided that some varieties have distinguishable characteristics and particular value for se- lecting insects. Insofar as a pollinator is capable of distinguishing some varieties, it tends to select the best food plants from the available material. This selection is 4Steadfast Pollinators are conditioned to visit the same flower type at a given time, evidently after their previous choice. Constant Pollinators are involuntarily bound to a single, a few, or many plant species during their lifetime. E. Loew calls them, respectively, monotropic, oligo- tropic, or polytropic visitors. According to this viewpoint, honeybees are polytropic because they are not bound with any special nectar plant. But they exhibit, nevertheless, a high rate of steadfastness to their previously chosen flower types, and so do many other pollinators (Leppik, 1953b, p. 230, footnote; 1956, p. 234).</page><page sequence="4">RELATIONSHIP OF PLANTS AND INSECTS 469 PHYLOGN ITNTERNAL FACTOQ5, PHYLOGEFN ET I C O X V ExT R5NAL TRNI % )FA C oR5 IF, -i~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * H O LO G E N E T I C T RE N D &gt; FIG. 1. Presumptive interaction of internal and external factors on the course of evolution, as exemplified in the differentiation of flower types under the selective activity of pollinating insects. consequently directed instinctively by in- sects toward the improvement of plant ma- terial in an area and refinement of the biochemical composition of selected plant groups, as described elsewhere (Leppik, 1955a, p. 49). Carrying pollen from one plant variety to another, insects uncon- sciously produce new combinations of genes and new idiotypes. But they can ''consciously" select some of these new types for their continuous visits and fur- ther crossings as soon as these new types attract the attention of pollinators as bet- ter food plants. In their permanent search for better sources of food, insects become uncon- scious carriers of pollen and important plant "breeders." Guided by inborn in- stincts, their many-sided selective activity is directed through numerous generations towards the same goal of getting better nectar plants, which are marked at the same time with more precise combinations of colors and symmetry. The same in- herited instincts drive myriads of individ- uals of the same species into a well co- ordinated selective work resulting in the development of special flower types, as described below. Even if an insect does not "breed" or "choose" in the anthropomorphic sense of the word, their instinctive activity never- theless results in a continuous "selection" among their food plants. On the level of innate reactivity to the visual stimuli, a definite flower may release in an insect more, or more complete, responses than others, which condition may cause insects to "select" one definite flower type for their continuous visits. Besides, a flower visitor can always learn that some flowers are provided with better nectar deposits and are more easily accessible than others. The steadfastness and the constancy 4 of pollinators are, therefore, most natural consequences of their selective ability and activity. Consequently, the most vital processes in the development of entomophilous plants, such as fertilization, seed produc- tion, and the selection of descendants, are controlled by insects, and the evolution of these plants is considerably influenced by the sensory behaviour of their pollinators. Insects pollination is therefore a very special type of natural selection, exercised by insects in search of better food plants. But it can be equally considered as a particular type of "sexual selection" whereby pollen collected from definite plants is transferred to the selected indi- viduals of the same species for subse- quent fertilization. In another paper this special type of selection is defined as "tropheclexis," i.e., search of food con- nected with selection of better types of food plants (Leppik, 1955a, p. 49). In addition, many other regulating fac- tors of biotic, physical, and genetic na- ture affect the general trend of evolution as a biotic whole or "holon." All these factors may be treated jointly under two groups: internal or phylogenetic (inheri- tance, new gene combinations, new idio- types) and external or hologenetic 5 fac- 5Hologeny is defined as a genesis and histori- cal development of the biotic whole or holon (Leppik, 1948a, b, 1953a, p. 67).</page><page sequence="5">470 E. E. LEPPIK tors (physical and biotic environment, natural and sexual selection, tropheclexis, etc.). Both groups act independently of each other and are attempting to convey the evolution of organisms into different directions, which may be sketched as in figure 1. The evolution is therefore merely a result of these two trends, each com- posed of many factors, as defined and de- scribed in another paper (Leppik, 1955a). The present view is in accord with the morphological treatment of the flower as presented by C. L. Wilson and Just (1939) and the typological approach as summarized by Th. Just (1939, 1952). BASIC FLOWER TYPES AND THEIR EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS A comparative study of contemporane- ous flower types reveals that there is a restricted number of more generalized basic forms and a great many of special- ized flowers than can be derived from ba- sic forms. Basic types are represented exclusively in phylogenetically older plant groups, whereas the derivatives are found mostly in the specialized flowers of higher evolutionary levels. According to their form and symmetry, six morphologically graded series or "type classes" can be established among flowers, as follows: amorphic 3 -- haplomorphic -&gt; actinomorphic -&gt; pleomorphic -- stereo- morphic -- zygomorphic. This method of typological classification appears natural and corresponds to the main evolutionary sequence of flower types (see below). For instance, one needs only to take a sunflower head apart to see that a zygo- morphic ray floret is really a remolded stereomorphic tubulate flower, the later one being formed from an actinomorphic pentamerous type, which for its part has evolved obviously from a haplomorphic prototype (Small, 1919). In the butter- cup family (Ranunculaceae), this evolu- tionary sequence is clearly expressed in the floral structure of the ecologically highly specialized Superranunculae (Lep- pik, 1948b). A dissection of highly zygo- morphic flowers of Aconitum and Del- phinium reveals the successive evolution step by step from a stereomorphic (such as Aquilegia), pleomorphic, actino- morphic, haplomorphic, and finally from an amorphic prototype. In the pseudan- thium of Dichromena ciliatta, an entomo- philous beakrush from the tropics, are demonstrated successive evolutionary trends from amorphic -4 haplomorphic -- actinomorphic, and so on (Leppik, 1955b). Still further evidence supporting the above projected evolutionary sequence of flower types can be obtained from the ob- vious parallelism between the evolution of flowers and sensory development of cer- tain insect pollinators, as described below. In a previous paper an attempt was made to arrange existing flower types ac- cording to their assumed historical devel- opment from more primitive and general- ized structures to the very specialized flowers of higher angiosperms (Leppik, 1948a). It appeared appropriate to sub- divide the whole historical sequence of flower types into five or six successive periods, as described below. There is a good deal of conclusive evidence that dur- ing every one of these periods, a definite evolutionary level has been attained in the floral development, in which a corre- sponding morphological "type class" achieved its final form and shape. Once established and fixed genetically in some phylogenetical group or groups, a "type class" has obviously remained long with- out considerable change in its principal characteristics, but has split and special- ized into smaller typological units. As a matter of fact, all above mentioned "type classes" are still represented in the con- temporaneous flowers, some of them hav- ing preserved their ancient characteristics, and others becoming rather modern and specialized. Later on this scale of floral differentia- tion has been used for testing sensory ca- pabilities of different groups of insect pol- linators in various geographical areas and climatical zones. A striking correlation</page><page sequence="6">RELATIONSHIP OF PLANTS AND INSECTS 471 has been established in this study between the graded series of floral differentiation and increasing sensory abilities of pollina- tors to distinguish the above mentioned and below described "type classes" of flowers. The six observable levels in floral differentiation correspond to six de- terminable stages in the sensory develop- ment of insects, as sketched roughly in figure 3, and described in another report (Leppik, 1957). After some terminological corrections and a few changes in its structure, the above-mentioned preliminary schema of floral differentiation is presented here in more proper form for further criticism and for possible practical application by students of evolution. It became neces- sary to separate numerate flower types from a very expansive radiate level and to join accordingly all types with a defi- nite number of semaphylls 6 (petals, se- pals, ray flowers, etc.) into a separate type class of pleomorphic flowers. This type class corresponds to the numerate stage in the sensory development of cer- tain insect pollinators, being characterized by the determinable ability grade of these insects to distinguish figure numerals (Leppik, 1956). In figure 2, the six evolutionary levels are marked from the bottom to the top with Roman numbers I-VI. Main pro- gressive trends are indicated by arrows pointing upward. Arabic numbers indi- cate parallel trends in various phylogen- tic plant groups such as Monocotyledones, Tubiflorae, Campanulaeae, Compositae, and Ranales. (I). The primitive level at which amorphic flowers do not yet possess any special symmetry or particular colors. A 6 Trophosemeions (rpopo's = food, omLa, oq,elov = mark, sign) or "food marks" are colored petals, upper leaves, bracts, etc., which help pol- linators to locate food plants. They are com- posed of "semaphylls," in contrast to sporophylls -the stamens and pistils of ordinary flowers. Trophosemeions are different from "nectar guides," which are special pointers of nectar deposits inside of flowers (Leppik, 1956, p. 236- 240). primitive flower consists of an unre- stricted number of stamens and pistils, sometimes surrounded by a number of bracts or discolored upper leaves. It does not need any special sensory abilities of pollinators to distinguish such primitive flowers from common leaves of plants. Primitive flowers cannot offer much sweetness to their visitors, and they are commonly exploited by unskilled pollina- tors. Although this primitive type is not very common among recent plants, it is obvious that first entomophilous angio- sperms must necessarily have possessed flowers with such similar primitive char- acteristics. Such primitive types appear also when a wind-pollinated plant second- arily becomes entomophilous (see Di- chromena, Salix, Mimosa, and other ex- amples, Leppik, 1955b). According to a suggestion made in a recent letter to this writer by Dr. R. B. Gordon, Curator of the Darlington Her- barium in West Chester, Pennsylvania, this ancestral type class of amorphic flow- ers could be called also "paleomorphic." (II). The simple level with an haplo- morphic arrangement of petals, if any, and simple colors like yellow, white, or green- ish. These flowers are visited mainly by beetles and flies, whose mental abilities do not reach much higher from their simple stage of development. Magnolia, Lirio- dendron, Nelumbo, Nymphaea and other phylogenetically primitive genera of the order Ranales have flowers of such simple level. (III). The third radiate level is char- acterized by an actinomorphic or radiate symmetry. Flower parts are arranged in one level with stamens, pistils and nectar deposits. Flowers of this level frequently have pure colors, like white, yellow, blue, red, and so on. There is substantial evi- dence that these flower types evolved dur- ing a time when the main groups of pol- linators reached the third stage of their sensory development, which includes the ability to distinguish colors other than green, white, and yellow, and patterns of radiate symmetry.</page><page sequence="7">472 E.

(V). The fifth "protected" level of the evolution of flower types includes stereo- morphic flowers with protected nectar de- posits. This structure requires in their pollinators an ability to distinguish three- dimensional patterns in order to locate the nectar in the depth of the flower. Colors, symmetry, and "figure numerals" are similar to the IV level. (VI). The highest level in the floral development contains many special types of zygomorphic flowers. All these very specialized types have in common their bi- lateral symmetry, variegated but harmoni- ous combinations of colors, and the finest odors. According to present knowledge, this superior level of flowers corresponds to the highest stage in insects, that of rec- ognizing bilateral symmetry. This evolutionary sequence, however, is in agreement with the recent view about the phylogenetic development of angio- sperms. It is generally believed that apetalous groups are derived from peta- liferous ones, that numerous floral parts of each kind are more primitive than few parts, that apopetaly is more primitive than sympetaly, that hypogyny is more primitive than perigyny or epigyny, that separate and distinct parts of all kinds are more primitive than either adnation or connation, and that each of these changes has taken place independently in several groups (Bessey, 1915; Hutchinson, 1926; Cronquist, 1951, p. 15). THE PHENOMENA OF CONVERGENCY AND RECAPITULATION IN FLORAL EVOLUTION In the above-outlined standard scheme of floral evolution, only basic flower types of six subsequent levels are described and pictured in figure 2. Such evolutionary sequence is especially well represented in Ranunculaceae, including haplomorphic (Paeonia), actinomorphic (Anemone, Ranunculus), pleomorphic (numerous species), stereomorphic (Aquilegia) and zygomorphic (Aconitum) types of five subsequent levels in a single family (Lep- pik, 1948b). An analogous broad holo- genetic amplitude can be observed also in Liliiflorae, an order which includes repre- sentatives of four type classes. All other orders and families of angiosperms are restricted to one or two type classes, and only seldom reach the third class (Leppik, 1955a, fig. 5). Beside the two main trends in the floral evolution of Dicotyledoneae and Monoco- tyledoneae, there are many cases of con- vergency and parallel developments, where analogous flower types have been evolved in various phylogenetically unre- Ability of Insects to Distinguish _ _ _ Levels Flowver Types Characters of Flowers VI Zygomorphic Types.

LEPPIK lated plant groups. Particularly rich in such examples are radiate and protected evolutionary levels, including numerous actinomorphic, pleomorphic, and stereo- morphic types of striking similarity in most various plant groups. In most cases of convergency, some common pollinator, or at least insects with similar instincts or of the same stage of sensory development, might be suspected to have played a role in "selecting" and "breeding" analogous types in unrelated plant groups. Following are some examples of a con- vergent evolution among flower types. Dichromena ciliata Vahl represents an entomophilous trend among wind polli- nated Cyperaceae. This white beak-rush has an established relation with tropical insects and developed secondarily a showy white "pseudanthium," formed by involu- crated upper leaves. The effect of this imitated "flower" is striking, and the plant is frequently visited by stingless wild bees (Meliponidae), bumblebees, and honeybees (Leppik, 1955a, b). Among the varieties of Dichromena cili- ata are less developed haplomorphic types, others with well established radiate sym- metry, and some which bear constantly five white leaves in their involucres. The development from haplomorphic to actino- morphic and from polyphyllous to penta- phyllous structures is well demonstrated, which tendency corresponds to the gen- eral trend of floral evolution, as pictured in figure 2. Lantana camara L. is a tropical mem- ber of the Verbenaceae with a remarkable tendency to arrange its flowers into a ra- diate inflorescence, imitating an actino- morphic type of a single flower. The cen- tral flowers differ from the peripheral ones by color, the latter being arranged in some varieties like petals (Leppik, 1954, p. 158, photo 3, right). Numerous further progressive trends are exemplified in specialized flower types which are pollinated by some definite group of insects. These trends occur fre- quently among stereomorphic and zygo- morphic flowers, and are correlated with the sensory development of their pollina- tors. Well known examples are so-called bumblebee flowers, which are bilaterally symmetrical, such as Aconitum, Delphin- ium, Aquilegia, Iris, and Antirrhinum. Some North American species of the' normally pleomorphic genus Rhododen- dron, which are pollinated here by bum- blebees, tend to develop slightly zygo- morphic flowers, marked with a yellow "bumblebee spot" on the upper petals. Another remarkable phenomenon in the evolution of flower types is a recapitula- tion of the above described main historical sequence of floral differentiation in some phylogentically restricted plant groups. Frequently the entire evolutionary se- quence of the angiosperms (amorphic -&gt; haplomorphic -4 actinomorphic -4 pleo- morphic -&gt; stereomorphic -* zygomor- phic), which occurred during several geo- logic eras, is repeated in a new form over a relatively short period of time, such as represented in the capitulum of the Com- positae, cyathium of the Euphorbiaceae, etc. Various regressive and rudimentary organs, such as deformed upper leaves, bracts, involucres, functionless stamino- dia, sterile outer flowers in an inflores- cence, and sometimes even ordinary leaves may initiate a new evolutionary departure. From this scanty material, most colorful structures are formed, step by step, such as the showy upper portion of Poinsettia, and prominent white bracts of Cornus florida. Further examples are: attractive pseudanthium of Dichromena ciliata, vari- ously colored synanthia (heads) of Com- positae, petal-like staminodia of Canna and brightly colored flowering shoots of Bougainvillaea. Whatever the origin of these new structures, in their final stage of development they all exhibit a striking resemblance to a true flower. Moreover, these secondarily developed imaginary flowers fulfill now the ecological function of true flowers, attracting by their form and color the attention of insect pollina- tors. A detailed analysis of these flower-like</page><page sequence="10">RELATIONSHIP OF PLANTS AND INSECTS 475 structures reveals their evolutionary trend from the amorphic arrangement of initial leaves or bracts to the haplomorphic and actinomorphic types, with an observable tendency toward pleomorphism, stereo- morphism, and zygomorphism. Further- more, a noticeable parallelism exists be- tween the evolution of these imaginary flowers and the phylogenetic sequence of their bearers (Leppik, 1955a). In this case, it would be extremely difficult to explain how some plant leaves, bracts, or stamens recapitulate hurriedly the whole course of floral evolution and become showy parts of a flower. But by taking into consideration the sensory capabilities and innate behavior patterns of insect pollinators, the whole course of floral evolution appears simple and natural. According to the present theory an ac- celerated evolutionary development among flower types may take place when a plant group is exposed to insect pollinators whose sensory development has reached a higher stage than the corresponding evolutionlary level of the flowers (see above). In this case pollinators instinc- tively select ecotypes and possible mu- tants from the available material, whose color, form or size seems to them closer to the types to which they are innately conditioned. Real differences in these flowers in the beginning may be very small but nevertheless perceptible to the insect eye, such as variations in color, form, size, symmetry, and odor. When these morphological differences are ac- companied by a noticeably better nectar or pollen supply, or are more easily ac- cessible to certain pollinators, the latter may remain steadfast to these varieties for a long time. An intensive crossing and mixing of pollen among definite varieties produces an abnormal number of new idiotypes, which are displayed to the pol- linators for further selection. From such polymorphic material it is possible for certain pollinators to select definite types they prefer for one reason or another. Among entomophilous plants there are numerous concrete examples for such pro- gressive floral evolution and some few cases of a retrogressive trend, as pointed out above and described elsewhere (Lep- pik, 1954, 1955a, b, 1956). Degeneration of petals and semaphylls is a common con- sequence of a secondarily introduced ane- mophily among flowering plants. Ex- change of specialized pollinators to some mentally less developed groups of insects results in an observable regression in floral structure. Zygomorphic types may revert to stereomorphic and actinomor- phic to haplomorphic, and so on. Such examples occur quite frequently among Compositae, Ranunculaceae, Euphorbia- ceae, and in many other families. A CONJECTURAL SENSORY MECHANISM OF ANTOPHILOUS INSECTS In all probability there are definite se- ries of inborn instincts and inherited re- flexes in anthophilous insects, which func- tion automatically as responses to the visual stimuli produced by certain flower types. Some reactions in these insects seem to be acquired as a result of experi- ence "learning," and could be classified as conditioned reflexes. Obviously such con- ditioned reflexes, produced by some visual stimulus repeatedly over a long period of time, become finally established in the nervous system of insects as inherited re- flexes. Many reflexes are known to be interrelated, so that a reaction to a certain. stimulus may act as a stimulus for a sec- ond reflex, this for a third one, and so on until the full series of definite actions is completed. In many other cases compli- cated sensory processes occur for which no explanation is proposed. But every process which occurs even once must have a mechanism, whether we understand it or not (Huxley, 1942, p. 509). Though the specific sensory mecha- nisms are not yet established experimen- tally, the existence of such a clockwork in anthophilous insects is nevertheless well evidenced by the particular behavior and instinctive activity of this group of insects. Thus it is possible to advance, with con-</page><page sequence="11">476 E. E. LEPPIK siderable accuracy, a reliable explanation of the functions of this mechanism, as de- scribed below. In this paper we want to define such mechanism as a combination of certain sensory processes which result in a definitely co-ordinated physical activ- ity of insects. We tend to call this sen- sory mechanism "conjectural" in order to stress its specific presumptive nature and to distinguish it from the general mecha- nistic concept, such as "a mechanism of a clock" (see the definition of "mechanism" in Webster's Intern. Dictionary). A classic example of such stereotypic series of instinctive activities of anthophi- lous insects can be seen in the behavior of the Pronuba moth, as described already by Aristotle and quoted now in most text books of general biology. Pollination of many other entomophilous plants is an equally complicated process, which re- quires a high degree of innate capabilities, and existence of a regulating sensory mechanism in their pollinators. Some very specialized pollinators take no food from flowers, but are guided by their mating instincts, which in some in- sects are unusually strong and complex. A well known example is the pseudocopu- lation between certain wasps and orchids. Several species of Ophrys and Crypto- stylis are visited and pollinated by male wasps for the striking resemblance of these flowers to female insects. During mating, male insects fly from flower to flower, being attracted mostly by varieties and possible mutants among orchirds with certain resemblance to female insects, which are not yet born at that time. Not finding true females, deceived males fi- nally pseudocopulate with some flowers, pollinating unconsciously these orchids with heterogenous pollen. No wonder, therefore, that in such unusual circum- stances the evolution of the above-men- tioned orchids is turned toward strange insectiferous forms, such as represented by Ophrys insectifera L. This strange phenomenon was first described by Pou- yanne (1916) from North Africa, by Coleman (1928) from Australia, by Wolf (1950) and Kullenberg (1952) from Europe (see also Ames, 1937). Existence of a further sensory mecha- nism, which tends to direct the evolution of flower types in a predetermined direc- tion, has been ascertained recently in honeybees, bumblebees, stingless wild bees, tropical butterflies, and seems to be inherent in many other insect groups. Though the mechanism itself is not yet fully explained, its existence and function- ing are well demonstrated by the particu- lar behavior of these insects. It is further evidenced by the actual trends of floral evolution, which can be traced back through several geological eras (Leppik, 1953b, 1955a, 1956). This mechanism has evolved gradually in pollinating in- sects, apparently parallel with the differ- entiation of flower types. In its lower stages, this mechanism is functioning ana- logically in many insect groups, but be- comes more specialized in the higher stages of its development. In higher, specialized pollinators it consists now of six successive stages which can be deter- mined as six ability grades of these in- sects to distinguish six main type classes and a number of specialized forms of flowers, as described above. In mentally less evolved insect groups, this mechanism is simpler, consisting only of some lower grades of the sequence. This classificatory mechanism must of necessity consist of a definite series of sensory processes which are similar in many insect groups whose food searching activity is restricted mainly to flowers. In the early beginning this mechanism could have been fixed as a response to a primitive visual stimulus, produced by an amorphic aggregation of yellow stamens on a green or whitish background of upper leaves, which reflex has guided these pollinators to the ancient paleomor- phic flowers. It is obvious that some va- rieties or ecotypes among those primitive flowers with more intensive colors and more regular symmetry must have pro- duced a stronger stimulus and released more complete reflexes in insects than</page><page sequence="12">RELATIONSHIP OF PLANTS AND INSECTS 477 other flowers. Such variations must have challenged primitive pollinators to a con- tinuous selection of "better" types among flowers, in particular when the coloration and symmetry has concurred with a higher nectar or sugar content of those flowers. A gradual differentiation of the next haplomorphic type class must have resulted from such a selection, and sev- eral new reflexes added to the sensory mechanism of those primitive -pollinators. Still additional stimuli were needed to awaken a sense for two-dimensional sym- metry in insects, which was necessary for the recognition of the third, actinomorphic type class of radiate flowers. New com- binations of form, symmetry, and colors in flowers must have stimulated insects for further progressive development. Step by step, responses to figure nu- merals, third dimension, and finally to bi- lateral symmetry must have been added as successive stages for the development of the sensory mechanism in anthophilous insects. This main trend of the sensory evolution of insects is reflected in the floral differentiation from the amorphic to haplomorphic, actinomorphic, pleomor- phic, stereomorphic, and zygomorphic type classes, as pictured in figure 2. Under the existing conditions, this evo- lutionary sequence is probably the only possible course of development for both insects and plants. Such a mutual evo- lution of insects and plants makes both participants highly interdependent. Ex- cept for some retrogressive trends, there seems to be only one logical way for the progressive expansion of simple reflexes into more complicated sensory processes enabling the insect to distinguish two- dimensional flower types, numeroid, three-dimensional and finally the forms of bilateral symmetry. The floral differen- tiation from the elementary amorphic ma- terial to the haplomorphic, actinomorphic, pleomorphic, stereomorphic, and finally to the zygomorphic types, seems equally natural. Such successive development of flower types is also in accord with the progressive genetical variability of flower- ing plants, such as production of new mutants resembling the next higher (or lower)* type class. The genuineness of this evolutionary sequence is evidenced further by its parallel occurrence in nu- merous genetically unrelated plant and in- sect groups. Once established and fixed genetically, these sensory mechanisms must function continuously through centuries, govern- ing the behavior of anthophilous insects. Every additionally adapted process must necessarily increase the corresponding ca- pability grade of insects to distinguish flowers of the next higher type class. Consequently the less evolved insects must be attracted ordinarily by lower, and the more evolved by higher type classes, which is of course in accord with well es- tablished facts. Such stereotyped behav- ior of anthophilous insects is obviously an important regulating mechanism, which tends to direct the selective activity of pollinators and subsequently the evolution of flower types in a definite predetermi- nated trend. Field observations have shown that pol- linators commonly are most attracted by the flowers of highest possible type class accessible to them, and -that they select such classes from the available material for their permanent visits. Once stead- fast on a certain type, they tend to pick up varieties and ecotypes which are closer to the next higher type class (Leppik, 1954, 1957b, 1956.) These insects seem to perceive instinctively that a higher "rank" of flowers, according to "nomen- clature" of their own, means a better source of food, which perception is of course in accord with the biochemical evolution of flowering plants. In these circumstances the above de- scribed evolutionary sequence must nec- essarily be valid also in the development of the present-day flower types. Recent investigations show that this supposition is not only well-grounded in its general trend, but is also convincingly evidenced in numerous special cases. Recapitula- tion of this sequence is well demonstrated</page><page sequence="13">478 E. E. LEPPIK in the differentiation of flower heads of the Compositae (see above), of secondary flowers of the Euphorbiaceae, of pseudan- thium of the Dichromnena cilfata (Leppik, 1955b), and in many other cases. It is convincingly evident that insects cannot remember an unrestricted numnber of flower types, or even as many as are displayed to them in a local flora at a time. Actually they need to know only a series of three or four out of six basic patterns, which represent six main type classes of flowers. These basic patterns are repeated again and again in different size and color in numerous plant groups. Frequently symmetrically similar flower types are marked by figure numerals or by distinctive odors. For that reason va- rious local floras, in spite of their differ- ent taxonomic composition, exhibit an un- expected resemblance in their basic types, even in such distant areas as the arctic and tropics on the Eurasian, American, and African continents. In their special- ized types these floras show, of course, a greater variability. Several comparative studies of the writer in these areas have shown a proper correlation between the pollinating insects and distribution of flower types. It depends mainly on the dominant groups of local pollinators and on the stage of their sensory development which flower types prevail in a flora. SOME CONCLUSIONS Taking the above described facts and findings under consideration, some con- clusions can be deduced, as follows. It is evident now that certain anthophi- lous insects have developed during their long sensory evolution a perfect order of special symbols and figure numerals as well, which they are able easily to remem- ber and readily to distinguish from one an- other. As a result of an extensive selec- tion, performed by pollinating insects, these symmetrical patterns became grad- ually fixed in definite flower types, where they continued to evolve parallel with the progressive sensory development of their pollinators. In keeping with the generally accepted terms, such as the "language" and "dances" of bees, the above described system might well he designated as an "alphabet" and "numeral system" of in- sects, in an allegoric sense. By mastering this "alphabet," a "litterate" let us say, insect is able to distinguish hundreds of plant species from1 one another, and to recognize its hidden food resources from a considerable distance. This "alphabet" is not an assumption or theory, but rather a well-established system of directly observable patterns in nature. To master this "alphabet" means for anthophilous insects a not less impor- tant chance for survival than the com- mand of "language" for social insects. As a matter of fact, all nectar deposits, which may vary in quantity and quality, as well as all pollen stores in flowers are marked with one of these symbols. In addition these symbols indicate how to reach nec- tar deposits that are hidden in stereomor- phic and zygomorphic flowers, frequently behind long and labyrinthic passageways. Knowing a necessary number of these symbols, an "experienced" pollinator can easily orient himself among the multitude of food plants and estimate the food value and accessibility of every flower in ad- vance. In this way he can save much time and energy that would otherwise be needed for examination of every single flower. It is safe to say that even a very slight saving of time and energy becomes in the aggregate of great importance for the survival of a species as a whole. To the student of ecology and evolution, the deciphering of the "alphabet" of an- thophilous insects is not less challenging than the lately discovered "sign language" of honeybees. It offers quite new oppor- tunities to study the evolutionary relation- ship between plants and insects, and to comprehend in general the life and evolu- tion in its higher levels during the age of angiosperms. In this paper an attempt was made to parallel the floral differentiation of angio- sperms with the sensory development of certain insect pollinators. This parallel-</page><page sequence="14">RELATIONSHIP OF PLANTS AND INSECTS 479 ism is clearly reflected in the evolution of sernaphylls (Leppik, 1956, p. 452), the showy parts of flowers designed for the attraction of pollinating insects. But there is much temptation also in the method of V. Grant (1950a) to study the evolution of sporophylls, particularly the developmiient of an inferior ovary as a pro- tective device against devoluring insects. In both these cases insects and flowers are mullltually interrelated in evolution, as reciprocal selective factors. In this milu- tualislmj, however, two inverse ways of interaction are involved, as follows: a synagonistic and an antagonistic. Syna- gonistic mode of interaction results froml- a perfect sVnagonisln or cooperation of insects and plants, as consum-iers and pro- ducers. This cooperation is highly ad- vantageous or even a necessity for the existence of both participants, providing thus anl itlmportant precondition for a mu- tual adaptation of insects and plants to one another. An antagonistic trend, on the contrary, leads to the development of protective devices in plants against certain devouring insects. Since these insects tend to select for their meals flowers with less protected and more easily accessible ovaries, such selection has a reverse ef- fect on plant evolution. But any antago- nistic activity may turn over to synago- nism as soon as such activity will have a mutual value and evolutionary signifi- cance for both participants, as in the case of Pronutba ytacasella. SUMMARY Systematic study and classification of flower types have revealed several observ- able trends in floral development. Mor- phologically graded series of recent flow- ers can be correlated with the general evo- lutionary trend of flowering plants. A further correlation between the evolution of flower types and the development of some sensory capabilities of pollinating in- 7 Synago (o-vva-y) means to lead, drive, bring together.

On the basis of these facts and findings a new view is emerging which sees in the food searching activity of pollinating in- sects an important selective factor which tends to keep the evolution of flowering plants in a predeterminated sequence. According to a recent theory, discussed in a previous report (Leppik, 1956), defi- nite stages in the sensory development of pollinating insects must necessarily be re- flected in corresponding levels in the evo- lution of flower types. In this paper, six distinguishable levels in the evolution of flower types are paralleled with the cor- responding six stages of sensory develop- ment of pollinating insects, as shown in figures 2-3. In addition, a presumptive sensory mechanism is discussed which obviously governs the food searching instincts of anthophilous insects and regulates their selective activity among flowers. Exist- ence of such conjectural mechanism is adequately demonstrated in the orderly process of selection by these insects, which activity causes flower types to evolve in a certain, consecutive sequence. The ap- lication of this new theory will elucidate not only the historical development of a given flower type, but enables one to view also the further evolutionary tendency of present flower types. A practical yard- stick for such evolutionary deternminations is added for further criticism and possible use by students of evolution (fig. 2). LITERATURE CITED AMES, 0. 1937.
