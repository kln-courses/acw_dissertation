<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Interpersonal Communication: Essays in Phenomenology and Hermeneutics. Joseph J. Pilotta, Editor. Washington, D.C.: Center for Advanced Research in Phenomenology, and Univer- sity Press of America, 1982. Pp. ix + 185. $20.00; paper, $9.95 The cohérence of this book is the product of Pilotta' s successful effort to build on essays originally contributed to a symposium on phenomenology and hermeneutics held in 1978 at the Ohio State University. New articles were added to thematize and complete the survey of the key issues which emerge in the con- junction of the scientific and philosophical approaches to com- munication. The first essay, by Stanley Deetz, "Hermeneutics and Research in Interpersonal Communication," contextualizes the discussion with a référence to the "thesis of complementar- ity." "Positivistic quantitative research is valuable when con- ducted with an awareness of its own limitations and with a re- spect for alternative forms of knowledge." In turn Deetz argues that "phenomenological thought should add to the value of em- pirical research rather than replace it" (pp. 1-2). He illustrâtes his point with a discussion of intersubjectivity as a hermeneutic thème in récent communication research covering conversa- tional analysis, personal construct theory, and interaction pro- cess analysis of Ruesch and Bateson ancestry. Michael Hyde's "Transcendental Philosophy and Human Communication'9 traces the philosophical development that leads to Heidegger9 s proposai for a transcendental analytic as a special case of the methodological process of "understanding-in- terpretation-meaning." Drawing on a comparative discussion, Hyde's analysis spécifies for us the central place of the "de- mand for reflexivity" in communication research (p. 33). The third essay in the book is Pilotta' s own "Communicative Compétence as a Research Criterion: A Philosophy of Social Science Directive." His goal is ambitious indeed: "To présent a logic of social science based on communicative compétence Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 16, No. 4, Fall 1983.

In a de- tailed and well-argued présentation, Pilotta co vers the proble- matic of mutuai interaction. What is made thematic in this com- plex discussion is the need for a "three valued [sic] social re- search logic" (p. 36). While the proposai for a three-value logic is not new (a populär one was proposed by Lukasiewicz in 1920), Pilotta suggests the manner in which the "language of hermeneutics and phenomenology" can be employed methodo- logically to instantiate this three-value view (p. 47). "The Dialogical Region" by Algis Mickunas is the fourth con- tribution. His essay is a particularly sensitive analysis of the "triadic relationship" of person, other, and lived-world that her- meneutic phenomenology views as both dialectic and dialogical in thè communicative process of understanding. He illustrâtes the nature of the "policentric structure of the perceptual field" (p. 55) with a discussion of Husserl' s argument for the reversible entailment of "I-consciousness" and "We-consciousness" as the dialogical condition of intersubjectivity. The self-other-world dialectic becomes the dialogue of the cultural, historical, and naturai modalities of comportment, community, and institution. Don Ihde's "The Expérience of Media" is an explication of the médiation that a technological society brings to itself with devel- opmental media of communication. Philosophers may find this essay enlightening insofar as it focuses upon the communications media as an object of human perception, but communicologists will find echoes of theory construction that took place in the 1950s (recali that Elihu Katz and Paul Lazarsfeld published Per- sonal Influence: The Part Played by People in the Flow ofMass Communications in 1955). However, this essay should be read as a précis for Ihde's detailed account in Technics and Praxis (Re- idel, 1979) which makes the philosophically interesting connec- tion to the work of Heidegger and Hans Jonas. "An Examination of the Concept of Interaction Involvement Using Phenomenological and Empirical Methods" by Donald J. Cegala is an effort to quantitatively affirm Deetz's "thesis of complemanatariety." He spécifies that "the essence of interper- sonal communication is that there is an immediacy of speaker/ listener rôle exchange among participants" (p. 81). He reviews several research studies of his own which indicate that the thesis is a possible answer to his research question: "How is the expé- rience of interpersonal communication possible?" (p. 81).

With Elizabeth A. Behnke's article "Contexts for Communi- cation: An Introduction to the Contribution of Jean Gebser" we are introduced to thè hermeneutic phenomenology in Jean Gebser' s Ursprung and Gegenwart, What I think most readers will find interesting in this essay is the introduction of cosmol- ogy as a concern of communication studies. While Behnke makes a solid case for the mythic model (as opposed to the "mental-rational") of communication as a philosophie focus, there is the obvious lack of discussion that the reader antici- pâtes. Namely, what does Gebser offer that we have not already learned firom the now famous phenomenologist (Ricoeur) versus structuralist (Lévi-Strauss) debate that took place in France? The eighth essay in the collection is Hugh J. Silverman's "Communicability." His discussion is a thematic extension of Jasper' s analysis of communicability in Reason and Existenz. The extension is the "possibility of shared meanings" that can be physical, conceptual, and experiential (p. 109). Silverman's essay is an excellent démonstration of the existential élément in communication. Indeed, the simple clarity of Silverman's writ- ing tends to make the reader forget the ontological difficulty of the explication. Tim L. Widman's "The Philosophical Problem of the Objective Historical Sciences" is a generai introduction to the problem of historical interprétation in the human sciences as articulated by Gadamer. In spite of an anthropomorphic tonality, Widman sum- marizes thè basic project in Truth and Method, yet fails to discuss those concepts that would be most révélant to placing Gadamer' s work within the problematic of communication. I am thinking in particular of Gadamer' s volitional stance with the concept of "préjudice" as a communicative procedure in the practice of rationality. The difficult issue of determining "validation and objectivity in text hermeneutics" occupies Thomas M. Seebohm in his es- say "The Significance of the Phenomenology of Written Dis- course for Hermeneutics." In this exceptionally well-thought article, Seebohm not only makes his own case for a spécifie hermeneutic procedure, but shows a powerful limitation to the "traditional hermeneutics" formulated by Gadamer and Ricoeur</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 265 (p. 146). The essay is a rare, but impressive instance where metaphilosophy is also metacommunication. There is more than irony in Alphonso Lingis' "Abject Com- munication" which ends thè volume. In thè tradition of Kris- teva's Pouvoirs de V horreur, Lingis gives us his own version of thè abject, thè antithesis of compierne η tari ty, in communication: 1. 'The core of life is plénitude and gratuitous, excess, power." 2. "It is through our needs and lack that we appeal to thè will in thè others - thè will to power in thè others, thè will to domi- nate." 3. "Self-consciousness is a 'disease,' a becoming-servile, a becoming weak" (p. 168). Contrary to thè hackneyed approach of typical collections that focus a method on diverse issues and problems, this book takes one problem and one methodological arena. The editor's effort is constructive and advances our understanding; our task in reading thè text has its value well placed. I highly recommend this book to thè audience for which it is written, philosophers and communicologists who seek qualitative research protocols that are a synergism of thè eidetic and empirical. Not many books for this purpose come along and succeed. This one does. It lends credence to thè disciplinary conjunction manifest in thè philosophy of communication. Richard L.
