In recent years, this position has come under particular scrutiny. Rather than rejecting the traditional theory out right, the present article posits an important corrective through a reexamination of the name language in context. In sum, the Deuteronomistic innovation lies not in absenting God from earth, but in leaving the exact nature and extent of his presence on earth ambiguous. Keywords name, name theology, divine presence Introduction Proponents of name theology have long posited that Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic History amend their predecessors' understanding of divine presence by moving YHWH from the temple into heaven, leaving behind only the name (?V)).2 There is, however, some disagreement regarding the nature of the presence left behind. In other words, is the temple for the name A shortened version of this article was presented as a paper at the Society of Biblical Litera ture Annual Conference in Boston, November 2008. 2) For the classic formulation, see G. von Rad, Deuteronomium-Studien (FRLANT 58; G?ttin gen, 1947), pp. 25-30. See more recently, e.g., H. D. Preuss, Old Testament Theology II (Louis ville, KY, 1996), p. 45. Hurowitz even calls it "a hallmark of Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic History" (V. A. Hurowitz, review of S. L. Richter, Deuteronomistic History and the Name Theology: Iesakk?n imo s?m in the Bible and the Ancient Near East (BZAW 318; Berlin, 2002), in Journal of Hebrew Scriptures A [2004-5]). ?

Hundley I V?tus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 merely a forwarding station that sends human concerns to God in heaven or is the name some form of representative presence, perhaps approaching hypos tasis?3 Recent trenchant critiques, especially those by Ian Wilson and Sandra Richter,4 have challenged traditional name theology and, as such, call for a reappraisal. Wilson convincingly argues that, while present in heaven, God remains present on earth according to Deuteronomy to a greater extent than proponents of name theology have allowed. However, in stressing the conti nuity of presence between Deuteronomy and its pentateuchal counterparts, he implicitly undercuts the genuine Deuteronomistic innovations. While Richter correctly contends that the various name formulae5 have been mis applied, her analysis of the formulae and the implications she draws from it are ultimately untenable. Instead of merely connoting ownership and by exten sion hegemony, the name in the name formulae is multivalent. In all of its various manifestations, placing one's name shares a common basis; it ensures that the individual named gets whatever benefits are to be had, with the result that the individual named accrues certain obligations and consequences. The present article responds to the traditional formulation in light of its dissi dents, with special reference to the name formulae, and, in the process, clari fies the nature of the divine presence elucidated by the name and its rhetorical significance. In short, the name language reveals enough to be meaningful but not enough to limit the deity. Beginning with a summary of the usage of the name ( )) outside D and Dtr6 to provide a field of reference, I will sketch the context of several key passages and, building on Wilson's work, analyze references to divine pres ence that do not use name formulae. Finally, with this framework in place, I will examine the various name formulae in context and in response to their biblical and ANE counterparts. 3) For the former position, see, e.g., R. Albertz, Israel in Exile: the History and Literature of the Sixth Century B.CE. (SBL Studies in Biblical Literature 3; Atlanta, 2003), pp. 294-295. For the latter, see, e.g., T. N. D.

Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 535 The Name Outside D and Dtr In the Hebrew Bible and the ANE, a name is more than simply a label.7 It serves as a person's identity that differentiates him from all others.8 The name "incorporates those elements that are associated with the particular person or Yahweh".9 In other words, a person needs a name so that his character, deeds, honor and authority may be ascribed to him and no other. Since they are ascribed to the person who is individualized by his name, they are also ascribed to the name itself. When referring to God, "the one who acts in cre ation and natural events cannot be described with any other name than Yah weh because he is the sole creator and lord of the world".10 In turn, creation itself and God's historic acts in it are ascribed to his name.11 In the Holiness Code, the continual refrain, 1 uses the name of God as a stamp of both authority and character.12 We may naturally assume that the name in Deuteronomy and the so-called Deuteronomistic History functions similarly. While the glory expresses God s visible majesty in the priestly texts, the name in D and Dtr describes God in his person?his character, his deeds, and the reactions they elicit. However, it is unclear what aspect of God the name stresses, and what sort of presence, if any, it entails.13 Because the name represents all aspects of a person, it may be 7) However, it is not the same as a person's essence as some have claimed (see A. S. van der Woude, " , s?m, name", TLOT 3, p. 1350). 8) In the Enuma Elish (1:1), for example, objects do not yet exist until they are named?i.e., they are not differentiated, but part of an undifferentiated, and thus unnamed, mass (van der Woude, TLOT?y p. 1356; Z. Bahrani, The Graven Image: Representation in Babylonia and Assyria [Philadelphia, 2003], p. 174). Naming also appears to be (an essential) part of the creative pro cess in Genesis 1. 9) F. V. R?it?rer, " , s?m", TDOTXV, p. 134; cf. van der Woude, TLOT 3, p. 1363: The name means "that which characterizes the bearer of the name". 10) Van der Woude, TLOT3, p. 1365; Ps 8:2, 10; Exod 9:16. n) Similarly, in Exod 3:14-15, ascribed to E, and Exod 6, ascribed to P, the revelation of the name precedes the exodus event, thereby ensuring that YHWH and no other gets credit for the upcoming deliverance. 12) Through it, he establishes who he is and what he demands in response. Thus, it is no sur prise that that there are such strict penalties against profanation of the name (e.g. Lv 24:11). In the priestly terminology, the name becomes a sanctum in its own right, which, like YHWH himself, cannot be profaned. 13) It is even possible, as Richter asserts, that the placing of the name speaks only of the hege mony of the one named (for Richter, other uses of the name imply memorial and reputation, although none in Dtr imply presence).</page><page sequence="4">536 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 used in different contexts to express different aspects of the person,14 be it honor or shame, strength or weakness, good character or bad.15 To determine the use of the name in Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic history, we must therefore examine the context.16 The Context in which the Name Formulae are Embedded The name formulae in Deuteronomy, 2 Samuel 7, and 1 Kings 8 all occur in a covenantal context, in which the relationship between the suzerain YHWH and his vassal Israel, especially represented by the king, gains greater clarity.17 Deuteronomy focuses on the formal relationship between God and Israel, on the authority and character of God on the one hand and the benefit to and the obligations of the Israelites on the other.18 2 Samuel 7 builds on this foundation, referring back to YHWH s earlier deeds that set the precedent for the present relationship19 before expanding on the nature of that relationship. This passage addresses the issue of temple building and the security of the Davidic dynasty.20 Like Deuteronomy, it concerns itself with the relationship between God and his people, stressing 14) E.g. Exod 33:19, 34:5-6. 15) Van der Woude, TLOT3, p. 1357. 16) Adjectives that modify ??0, construct forms and parallel expressions are particularly helpful in determining meaning. For example, in the expressions niNIlS and ^fc-nfe?'' UHp 1 , the modifiers provide "the substance conveyed by the DU&gt; (Reiterer, TDOTXV, p. 136)." We also must not isolate the word DU&gt;, instead reading it as part of the (potentially idiomatic) phrases it is embedded in (Richter). Finally, we must not transfer all the shades of meaning of into every occurrence, while, concurrently, not limiting a priori each instance to one partic ular meaning (i.e. allowing for potential multivalence). 17) The term covenant' here describes the formal relationship between God and his people, which progresses along a continuum from Deuteronomy to 2 Samuel 7 to 1 Kings 8. Although 2 Samuel 7 does not use this specific term ( !), it refers back to and builds upon God's deliv erance from Egypt (w. 7, 23). Each context adds specificity to the covenant, the latter two especially in relation to temple and dynasty. 18) Cf. J. H. Tigay, Deuteronomy, DHXT (Philadelphia, 1996), pp. xii-xviii. 19) The exodus from Egypt again features prominently (w. 23-24) to which YHWH adds his exaltation of David (w. 8-9). 20) From ANE, particularly Mesopotamian, parallels (see Richter, Deuteronomistic History, pp. 72-75), it is apparent that the two were at least somewhat connected. Whether or not David's motives are pious, securing his own kingdom is at least a secondary motivation. On the vertical plane, building a temple secures divine favor, which in turn secures David's throne. On the horizontal plane, building a temple legitimizes his rule (especially important for a usurper like David). On a political and a (perceived) metaphysical level, divine presence signals</page><page sequence="5">M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 537 the character and authority of God (as well as the deeds that establish both) along with the people's God-given privilege. 1 Kings 8 provides the conclusion to the account begun in 2 Samuel 7 and, as such, addresses similar issues. Temple and dynasty again figure prominently,21 as does the relationship between God and his people, which depends on God's character, authority and self-imposed obligation on the one hand and the people's repentance and obedience on the other.22 Divine Presence Without Reference to the Name Formulae Deuteronomy Within this larger framework appear various references to divine presence localized on earth, indicating that "the Deuteronomists cannot have been committed to a solely transcendent God". After comparing Deuteronomy 1-3, 4-5 and 9-10 with similar passages in Exodus and Numbers, Wilson con cludes that, of the thirteen comparable passages, "five refer to divine presence in both accounts, six do so only in Deuteronomy and two only in the Tetra teuch (the fifteen other instances of absence from one or other account can generally be explained in terms of differing emphases within the narratives')". After examining the use of 1 ^??h in chapters 12-26, he argues that the majority of occurrences should be understood in the literal, locative sense and, hence, "point to the localized presence of the Deity at the chosen blessing, while divine absence equals national disaster (for the former, cf. P. Machinist, "Litera ture as Politics: The Tikulti-Ninurta Epic and the Bible", CBQ 38/4 [1976], pp. 455-482). 21) The dedication and inauguration of the temple just completed follows a threefold pattern typical of Mesopotamia (M. Cogan, I Kings [AB 10; New York, 2001], p. 291; see further V. A. Hurowitz, I Have Built You an Exalted House [Sheffield, 1992], pp. 260-277). The chapter 1) inaugurates the temple with the introduction of the ark (as the closest approximation of the divine statue) into the Holy of Holies (w. 1-13); 2) contains the king's blessing of the people and prayer to YHWH concerning the temple's function (w. 14-61); and 3) concludes with a celebration involving sacrifice (w. 62-66). As in Mesopotamia, this threefold ceremony has great political as well as religious import, serving to solidify the reign of the monarch. 22) Whereas 2 Samuel 7 stresses the peoples privilege because of YHWH s beneficence, 1 Kings 8 introduces obligation. The perpetuation of the dynasty is contingent on their faithful emula tion of David, their progenitor (v. 25; cf. v. 23). The people's forgiveness is contingent on their repentance and obedience (w. 27-53).</page><page sequence="6">538 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 place'". From this, he concludes that there is "no support for the view that Deuteronomy... has eliminated the Deity from the earthly sphere".23 One example bears special mention. As in the other sources, God is present in theophany at Sinai,24 to which Deuteronomy adds another layer 23) Wilson, Out of the Midst, p. 217. After comparing Deuteronomy 1-3, 4-5 and 9-10 with similar passages in Exodus and Numbers, Wilson concludes that, of the thirteen comparable passages, "five refer to divine presence in both accounts, six do so only in Deuteronomy and two only in the Tetrateuch (p. 204; the fifteen other instances of absence from one or other account can 'generally be explained in terms of differing emphases within the narratives')". After examining the use of ^5*7 in chapters 12-26, he argues that the majority of occur rences should be understood in the literal, locative sense and, hence, "point to the localized presence of the Deity at the chosen place (p. 204)"'. From this, he concludes that there is "no support for the view that Deuteronomy... has eliminated the Deity from the earthly sphere (p. 213)". Mettinger ("The Name and the Glory: The Zion-Sabaoth Theology and Its Exilic Suc cessors", JNSL 24/1 (1998), p. 7 n. 10, 9 n. 11; cf. M. Keller, Untersuchungen zur deuterono misch-deuteronomistischen Namenstheologie [BBB 105; Weinheim, 1996], pp. 147-152) responds by claiming that the name formulae in Deuteronomy are "redactional, Deuteronomistic". However, while multiple levels of redaction are certainly possible, perhaps even probable (for a recent reconstruction, T. R?mer, The So-called Deuteronomistic History: A Sociological, Historical and Literary Introduction (London, 2006); cf., e.g., R. E Person, The Deuteronomic School: His tory, Social Setting and Literature (SBL Studies in Biblical Literature 2; Atlanta, 2002); E. Otto and R. Achenbach (eds.), Das Deuteronomium zwischen Pentateuch und deuteronomistichem Geschichtswerk (FRLANT 206; G?ttingen, 2004); G. . Knoppers and J. G. McConville (eds.), Reconstructing Israel and Judah: Recent Studies on the Deuteronomistic History (Sources for Bibli cal and Theological Study 8; Winona Lake, IN, 2002), Wilson demonstrates terrestrial divine presence in sections commonly attributed to the Deuteronomists (1-3, 4:1-40 and 9:7-10:11; for a convenient list of references, see ibid., pp. 12-13 nn. 52-54). Likewise, ^i?b appears alongside and is often attributed to the same redactional hand as Deuteronomy's name formu lae, even by Mettinger himself (ibid., pp. 195-197). Thus, for Mettinger's argument to hold, one would have to reassign texts referring to God's earthly presence to a different redactional layer. It seems better to conclude that God is present on earth at each level of composition. 24) Some argue that, since the people hear the divine voice yet see no form, God is not really present in the fire. However, few would deny that God is present in the theophanic encounters attributed to J, E and P. In each, God's presence is veiled; the people see no corporeal form, only the natural theophanic elements, most notably cloud and fire (although adds greater precision to the theophanic elements, his presentation is consonant with, if not an expansion of, those of J and E). Although each carries its own emphasis and language, the fire in Deuter onomy is similar to the fire described elsewhere. Thus, when Deuteronomy says YHWH speaks from the midst of the fire (Deut 4:12, 15, 33, 36, 5:4, 5:22, 24, 26, 9:10, 10:4; cf. 5:23), we may assume that he is present as much more than a disembodied voice. Other contextual ele ments also support a real, veiled presence. The subsequent prohibition in 4:15-16 "seems to suggest that God was actually present at Horeb, and that as a result of perceiving that Presence they may have been tempted to make an image of him (Wilson, Out of the Midst, p. 64, italics his)". YHWH's presence in the fire then "would provide good grounds for the prohibition since</page><page sequence="7">M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 539 of complexity. God is simultaneously present on earth in the fire and in heaven.25 Although various possible alternatives may be offered to resolve this tension,26 it seems best to conclude that God is simultaneously both in heaven and on earth.27 Like the gods of the Ancient Near East who can be present in their various statues and in heaven, YHWH can be present in two places at once, in heaven and in his sanctuary on earth.28 With his presence, people's non-perception of his form would render it impossible for them to reproduce an appropriate image (ibid.)". The people's response to the phenomenon and the passage's consis tency with other indications of divine presence add further support (ibid., pp. 64-65; see fur ther 66-80). 25) Ibid., pp. 68-73. While 4:32-35 assert that YHWH is God (35), w. 36-39 demonstrate that YHWH is "God in heaven above and on the earth beneath (39)". Verse 40 follows with an exhortation to obedience grounded on YHWH's double presence. "The people are to keep YHWH's commands because, being God in heaven, he alone has the authority to demand obe dience, and because, being at the same time God on the earth, he alone can ensure both the well-being of themselves and their descendants and also their continuance in the land which he has given them (73)". 26) For example, drawing on a (mis) interpretation of pU&gt;, G?rg resorts to the conclusion that YHWH is only present in the earthly sanctuary from time to time (M. G?rg, Das Zelt der Begegnung: Untersuchung zur Gestalt der sakralen Zelttraditionen Altisraels [BBB 7; Bonn, 1967], pp. 110-124). Mettinger {Dethronement) opts for a different course. He follows Metzger (M. Metzger, "Himmlische und irdische Wohnstatt Jahwes", UF 2 (1970), pp. 139-158, esp. 141-144) in drawing on Nabu-apla-iddina's relief in the Shamash temple of Sippar, which depicts, on one half, Shamash on his throne above the heavenly waters and, on the other half, a procession of worshipers in the Shamash temple, which is also above the heavenly waters. From this, he concludes that the event occurs simultaneously in heaven and on earth. Mettinger, in turn, suggests that the temple transcends the spatial dimension, "obliterating... [the distinc tion] between heavenly and earthly", as "both are subsumed under a higher mystical identity {Dethronement, pp. 29-30)". Although possible, Mettinger's distinction seems too clever and abstract (both of the above theories address divine presence in Zion-Sabaoth theology). 27) Another possibility, recently proposed by Z. Zevit at IOSOT 2007, is that the difference between heaven and earth is minimal. For example, since clouds and birds are associated with heaven, as long as God's feet do not touch earth, he is still in heaven (cf. Absalom, who when caught by his hair in the tree is caught between heaven and earth [2 Sam 18:9]; on this under standing of heaven, see further G. Bartelmus, " , s?mayim", TDOTXV, pp. 204-236, esp. 210). Thus, it would be easy to see how God could be present and acting in both especially as he descends in theophany. Although valid to an extent, his distinction is perhaps too facile to account for all of the complexity (e.g. God as both resident in the temple, in heaven and com ing on the clouds). It seems best to conclude that God (in some form) can be in multiple places at once, be it the temple, the air or in his heavenly abode. 28) In the Ancient Near East, the gods can be present in multiple forms in multiple places, including heaven and earth, without diminishment. For example, in Egypt, Amun is present in</page><page sequence="8">540 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 God brings heaven to earth, yet does so without diminishing his presence in heaven or leaving the heavenly realm unattended. Instead, God on earth also remains enthroned above.29 Thus Gods presence on earth carries with it all the connotations of God's presence in heaven. 2 Samuel 7 Although they do not feature prominently, references to divine presence do emerge in 2 Samuel 7. In verse 2, the ark, seemingly equated with God's localized presence, dwells within tent curtains. God responds to David's request to build a temple by stating that, instead of dwelling in a temple, he has been moving about ( ^ ) in a tent since the Exodus (6). Finally, David sat before YHWH (IW 7??7V ^ish)?i.e., before the ark where God is present (18). Thus, in 2 Samuel 7, outside the name formulae, there is no reference to divine presence in heaven. Instead, we find hints that suggest divine pres ence on earth with the ark. Although most commentators attribute verses 2, 6 and 18 to a pre-Deuteronomistic layer,30 it is telling that the Deuteronomis tic texts do little or nothing to move God's presence from earth to heaven.31 various locales, while Ra is present in various earthly temples, most notably Heliopolis, and in the sun itself (see e.g. H. H. Nelson, "The Egyptian Temple: The Theban Temples of the Empire Period", BA 7 [1944], pp. 49-50). The gods are likewise present to some extent in all of their various images, including temple reliefs. In Mesopotamia, Shamash, for example, is both in his temple and in the sun. In Ugarit, Baal is present in his various temples and in his divine storm cloud (the preceding survey simplifies the issue; for a fuller examination, see my forth coming thesis). 29) Pace Mettinger and Metzger, the Shamash relief seems to give the worshiper confidence that, when he approaches Shamash in his temple, he really approaches the god in all of his heavenly splendor. 30) E.g. P. K. McCarter, II Samuel (AB 9; Garden City, NY, 1984); Mettinger, King and Mes siah: The Civil and Sacral Legitimation of the Israelite Kings (ConBOT 8; Lund, 1976). However, T. Veijola (Die ewige Dynastie. David und die Entstehung seiner Dynastie nach der deuteronomis tischen Darstellung [Helsinki, 1975]) attributes verse 6 to the Deuteronomist, while F. M. Cross (Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: Essays in the History of the Religion of Israel [Cambridge, MA, 1973]), Veijola, and R. A. Carlson (David, The Chosen King: A Traditio-Historical Approach to the Second Book of Samuel [Stockholm, 1964]) consider 18-29 Deuteronomistic in its entirety. J. Van Seters goes so far as to attribute the whole chapter to the Deuteronomist (In Search of History: Historiography in the Ancient World and the Origins of Biblical History [New Haven, 1983], pp. 272-280). 31) Few deny that verses 1-17 occupy "an important position in the larger Deuteronomistic cor pus (McCarter, II Samuel, p. 217)". It makes some sense that the Deuteronomists would not alter their source texts. However, it seems odd that, if their goal was to eradicate earthly divine presence and re-situate it in heaven, there is no apparent corrective.</page><page sequence="9">M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 541 1 Kings 8 References to divine presence abound. In contrast to Deuteronomy and 2 Samuel 7, the vast majority refer to God localized in heaven.32 This, how ever, does not mean that God's presence is limited to heaven. Instead refer ences to divine presence on earth are concentrated at the beginning and end of the chapter. The strongest references appear in sections generally attributed to an earlier hand.33 Allusions to divine presence also appear in texts assigned to the Deuteronomist.34 Thus, the text communicates mixed messages. Either the final verses are 1) misassigned, leaving only references to divine presence in heaven to the corrective Deuteronomistic hand, or 2) they are fossilized expressions that no longer carry their original meaning,35 or 3) they signify that divine presence is localized on earth in each textual layer, an expression that the Deuteronomist clarifies but does not ultimately abandon. I will examine the name formulae before trying to put the pieces together. Name Language Response to Richter Richter demonstrates that the expressions ?U) 1DU&gt; pttfr and DU&gt; 1DU&gt; UWb are synonymous and should be translated 'to place his name there' on the 32) Heaven is mentioned 13 times in the pericope, four of which specifically refer to heaven as God's dwelling place. Here, "[ fDD (w. 39, 43, 49; v. 30 uses the synonymous expression "[ \2&gt; DlpQ) stands parallel to the Solomon's statement that the temple is a D^qViD "[ ^ fDO. In addition, verse 27 asserts that the earthly temple cannot contain YHWH. 33) Sacrifices before the ark seem to imply that God is present with the ark (v. 5). As in the tab ernacle theophany (Exod 40) and the temple theophany of Chronicles (2 Chr 5:14; 7:1-3), the glory manifests itself in the house (1 Kgs 8:10-11), signifying divine approval and perhaps sug gesting divine habitation. Finally, Solomon calls the temple a perpetual dwelling place for God (v. 13). 34) The expression before the Lord ( ''isb) crops up in the closing verses, generally attributed to the Deuteronomist(s) (so, e.g., Mettinger, Dethronement, p. 47 and J. Gray, I &amp; II Kings [OTL; London: SCM Press, 1964], pp. 203-204). Solomon and the people sacrifice before YHWH (v. 62). The bronze altar in the courtyard is said to be before YHWH (v. 64), and the people celebrate the feast before YHWH (v. 65). Again, the most basic sense is locative, sug gesting that the people are in fact in God's proximate presence. The summary statement of verse 63 may also allude to earthly presence, as it speaks of the dedication of the house of the Lord (this traditional title may imply presence or it may simply be a shorthand for the Dtr expres sion, 'house for the name of YHWH'). 35) If this were the case, one wonders why the Deuteronomist would include such ambiguous statements when his purpose is to move God's presence from earth to heaven.</page><page sequence="10">542 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 basis of Akkadian parallels.36 Building on the work of Jacob, de Vaux and McBride,37 Richter argues that ]^V)b is a loan-adaptation of the Akkadian phrase suma sak?nu and ?V) IDt?) ?Wb is a calque of the same. She does an extensive examination of this phrase and its near-synonym suma satra sak?nu in the Akkadian corpus, finding significant evidence of the former particularly in victory and votive inscriptions and of the latter particularly in building inscriptions.38 She posits that the phrase "found its way to the northern Levant via the victory stelae of the Old Akkadian and Assyrian kings, and to the southern Levant by means of the Amarna letters".39 In addi tion, she elegantly accounts for the use of the Piel, arguing that the Piel or Hiphil forms of the native pV) would be "the only option for marking the borrowed meaning as transitive".40 Thus, she turns what had been a weakness of the loan word approach into a strength. However, there are some problems with her translation that leave more room for doubt than she allows.41 First, if her theory is correct, the cases of ?WV \y?h are the only ones in which the meaning to put, place' occurs instead of to dwell' or in the Piel 'to settle' for the Hebrew pt?&gt;.42 Second, the phrase UV)b TO ITUl*?, used in similar contexts, needs to be explained.43 Third, other texts seem to support the traditional translation 'to dwell'.44 36) The former features prominently in Deuteronomy, while the latter is the preferred term in the rest of the Deuteronomistic History. 37) Richter, "Place", p. 343. 38) Ibid., Deuteronomistic History, pp. 130-199. Suma sak?nu also appears in several correspon dences, including the Amarna letters. 39) Ibid., p. 199. She draws on several Phoenician inscriptions and especially on the 9th century bilingual Tell Fakhariyeh votive inscription to establish that the phrase did in fact appear in the Levant. In the latter, the NWS caique and the Akkadian cognate appear side-by-side in the translation. 40) Ibid., p. 121. 41) So Mettinger, review of S. Richter, Deuteronomistic History, in JBL 122/4 (2003), p. 754. 42) Ibid. Joshua 18:1 and Psalms 78:60 are possible examples (Richter, Deuteronomistic History, pp. 102-105). However, Leviticus 16:16 and Joshua 22:19 make it as likely, if not more likely, that these verses should be interpreted in the traditional sense (Mettinger, review of Richter, p. 754). 43) Van Seters, review of S. Richter, Deuteronomistic History, in JAOS 123/4 (2003), pp. 871 872. Although Richter makes a laudable attempt, her solution, as we will see, is ultimately unconvincing. 44) For example, Ps 74:7 refers to the temple as the 'dwelling place' of God's name ("]QW p\2&gt;Q). Even if one interprets this as a later misapplication of the name formula, it is hard to deny that, for some, the name dwells in the temple. In addition, Jer 7:12 inserts the phrase ^?W TuDt? alongside DDflN ruDWNl in verse 3 and DDHN T?DUh in verse 7. Richter translates the name for</page><page sequence="11">M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 543 Fourth, as we will see more below, the context in which the Akkadian phrases appear are different from those in which the Hebrew ones occur.45 Fifth, Richters attack on nominal realism', "defined as the supposed perception on the part of the ancient Semite that the name of an item or person, as a sym bol of the thing or person named, was in fact real, having consubstantial exis tence with the name-bearer", remains unfinished.46 Finally, it is difficult to believe that 'to place the name' and 'to build a house for the name' have nothing to do with divine presence, when divine presence is such an impor tant part of ANE and Israelite thought, including that of the Deuteronomist (see e.g. lKgs 8:27). Ultimately, however, none of these shortcomings are fatal. Thus, I am willing to accept Richters suggestion that ?V) ]3V)b should be translated as 'to place his name there', while allowing for the possi bility that it may also connote 'dwelling'.47 Reinterpretation of the Akkadian Evidence Whether or not we accept Richters translation, examining Akkadian paral lels, as she does, is particularly illustrative. Nevertheless, as will become clear, I come to significantly different conclusions. The Akkadian phrase suma mula with the borrowed sense, 'to put the name', and the other instances with the traditional sense 'to settle'. However, this translation may be too adroit. It would be more natural to assume a single translation for all instances, namely the factitive 'to settle'. 45) For example, the Akkadian expression refers to monuments and inscriptions, never to build ings or victories themselves. "To be sure, no building inscription is referred to anywhere in 1 Kings 5-9" (Hurowitz, review of S. Richter; her 2007 claim that placing the name in Deuter onomy means setting up a monument on Mt. Ebal is especially tenuous). Likewise, the the deity never places his own name on a monument; the king is always the subject (ibid.). The Mesopotamian kings also place their victory stelae throughout their kingdoms, while YHWH would only place his name in one location (cf. Van Seters, review of Richter, p. 871). Thus, if the Israelites borrowed the idiom, they must have adapted it to serve their own purposes. 46) Deuteronomistic History, pp. 14-22. She merely cites authors who agree with her position, while dismissing some of the questionable assumptions of those who have espoused such a the ory (e.g. the evolution from the primitive to modern mind). Aside from deriding these mis taken assumptions, she does not substantively address the merit of the theory itself. 47) Nonetheless, it remains to be seen what implications this translation has on the interpreta tion of the name. As we will see, I find Richters conclusions in this regard selective and ulti mately unsatisfying. Even if we adopt Richters perspective, the question remains unanswered {pace Hurowitz, review of Richter), as her theory says nothing about the Deuteronorriist's understanding of divine presence other than that the name formulae are not concerned with it; i.e. they address another issue entirely.</page><page sequence="12">544 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 sak?nu picks up various nuances from its context.48 Nonetheless, one mean ing in particular seems to transcend contextual categories. Just as a name dif ferentiates the named and his attributes from all others, so too does placing one's name. The end result of placing one's name is then to ensure that the named and no one else receives his due benefits. Rather than necessarily con noting ownership, placing his name ensures that he gets all the credit. As expected, these benefits vary depending on the context, ranging from claims of ownership to craftsmanship and even to honor. In a monumental context, they often connote ownership. With victory stelae or triumphal inscriptions, the victor puts his name on a monument so that the victory and the heroic deeds to achieve it are ascribed to him and no one else. In other words, by placing his name on the monument, he claims both the victory and the monument as his own. By extension, since the mon ument is a sign of victory over and a visible claim to hegemony over the region, the name ensures that the one named is identified as the suzerain.49 A votive inscription functions similarly. A person puts his name on a votive inscription so that he alone receives the benefits of his service (via the monu ment [see below]) and the blessings read on his behalf. In essence, he claims that the monument and all the benefits derived from it are exclusively his. Placing the name as claiming ownership touches down naturally in a mod ern context. For example, when a mother places her child's name in his shirt, she, in effect, claims that the shirt belongs to him. If another mother crosses out that name and writes her child's name instead, her act signifies a change in ownership. Building inscriptions have a slightly different focus. Instead of claiming ownership, they claim that the named is either the architect of the building project and/or its funder. Such a claim serves to ensure that, although the God is the owner of the building (in a temple context), the builder receives his due reward. Parallels again appear in a modern context; even though they make no ownership claims, an architect or a painter often puts his name on his craft so that he is credited with its artistry. Likewise, a library or museum often includes a plaque listing substantial donors so that they are visibly hon ored for their benevolence, again without suggesting ownership. 48) Richter, however, argues that the basic meaning in the monumental corpus is "to claim something as one's own by inscribing one's name upon it (Deuteronomistic History, p. 208)". In doing so, she puts the cart before the horse. Ownership is a natural outflow of some, though not all, instances of the phrase yet is not intrinsic to the phrase itself (see further below). 49) Cf. ibid., e.g., p. 208.</page><page sequence="13">M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 545 When the formula appears in a literary setting, be it a literary composition like the Gilgamesh Epic or a letter, its meaning is especially variable as litera ture does not belong to as fixed a context as any of the above genres. The basic meaning, as above, seems to be to place one's mark so as to receive the benefits of doing so. When the context is military, one makes his mark by claiming victory and, often as a result, territory.50 If the letter is from a vassal to a suzerain, it reminds the suzerain of his connection to the land acquired by treaty and conquest.51 Because the land is the suzerain's, the suzerain's rep utation is at stake when the land is in danger.52 When warfare and suzerainty are not at stake, the expression is free to take on a more extended meaning.53 Putting one's name can signify making one's mark (=achieving long-lasting honor) because of one's great and/or heroic deeds. With these benefits also come specific consequences and obligations. If a king attaches his name to a temple as the funder and architect and the build ing is unsound or is toppled by enemies, it speaks poorly of that king, impugning his reputation?e.g. it makes him appear weak and foolish. If a victory monument bearing a king's name and commemorating his victory is effaced, it too damages the king's reputation?e.g. he appears weak and his hegemony appears tenuous at best. Because of the possibility of such conse quences, the king has certain responsibilities. He must maintain and protect his temple and ensure that his victory monument is preserved, often by means of a curse formula and also by maintaining control of the conquered territory. In the Amarna letters, a king must protect his vassal since an assault upon the vassal is an assault upon the king. Application of the Akkadian Evidence to Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic History How then does this Akkadian background inform the phrase in Deuteron omy and the Deuteronomistic History? It need not suggest a case of simple 50) E.g. Samsi-Adad Is letter and the contemporary letter from Semsara (ibid., pp. 175-176). 51) EA 287 and 288 (see R. de Vaux, "Le lieu que Yahv? a choisir pour y ?tablir son nom", in F. Maass (ed.), Das ferne und nahe Wort [Berlin, 1967], pp. 219-288; Richter, Deuteronomistic History, pp. 176-177). 52) Such an appeal, here as in the Bible, is an attempt to use whatever leverage the vassal has to impel the suzerain to act. 53) As in the Sulgi hymn and the Gilgamesh Epic (see ibid., pp. 181-182, and notes cited therein).</page><page sequence="14">546 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 borrowing as Richter seems to intimate.54 First, even in the Akkadian, it carries different nuances in different contexts. Thus, applying certain of these (e.g. ownership and hegemony) at the expense of others as Richter does, requires further justification. Second, and more importantly, there is no direct parallel to the biblical account. The gods nowhere inscribe their names to claim either ownership or hegemony. The kings and other human aggres sors are always the subject of such actions. To transfer the semantic freight as literally as possible from one context to the next would paint a disturbing picture that even the most radical of commentators, let alone biblical authors, would find unpalatable. Since kings make such inscriptions, God would be comparing himself to a human king. Since powerful kings place their inscrip tions throughout their realm, often marking its boundaries, YHWH would be a minor king since he places his inscription in one place (either in or as the temple itself). Thus, the text would be comparing YHWH to a weak human king. It seems better to assume that, well aware of its 'semantic cargo',55 the Deuteronomist takes ANE language and adapts it to express his unique message. The richness of expression in the Bible outside Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic History seems to complement that of the Akkadian sources. Indeed, the Akkadian terms allow for greater richness than the standing impression.56 With this foundation in place, it is natural to assume that the name formulae in D and Dtr partake of this multivalence. However, there is a flip side to the name's multivocality, one which especially emerges in regard to divine presence, namely that multiple possibilities allow for significant ambiguity. 54) E.g. Place, p. 344. 55) Ibid. 56) As always the context is determinative. In each case, it seems to pick up certain nuances associated with the name. An examination of the multifaceted triumphal inscriptions is suffi cient to demonstrate this point. The monument memorializes the king's prowess in battle (Richter, Deuteronomistic History, p. 140), serves as a visual record of the event, which expresses the official point of view (L. D. Levine, Two Neo-Assyrian Stelae from Iran [Toronto, 1972], p. 15; Richter, Deuteronomistic History, p. 140), and claims ownership of the vanquished region (W. W. Hallo, "The Royal Inscriptions of Ur: A Typology", HUCA 33 (1962), pp. 1-43; Rich ter, Deuteronomistic History, p. 141). In addition, it highlights the king's character (e.g. as a mighty warrior) and his deeds that express this character (e.g. his mighty victories). In each case, placing the name ensures that all of these honors are ascribed to the king and no one else. Richter, however, seems to pick up on one or two aspects (ownership and hegemony) and applies them unilaterally.</page><page sequence="15">M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 547 In broad terms, by placing his name in the temple, God obtains certain benefits that carry both consequences and obligations. An examination of the name formulae in context bears out and enfleshes this proposal. Name Formulae in Context By placing his name (D# and DIP lOtf ?Wb) in the temple, YHWH binds himself to the temple and the relationship with Israel that it entails.57 God becomes the de facto owner of the temple as he has already become owner of the people through their redemption from Egypt. In turn, he becomes duty-bound to exercise just rule as suzerain over the temple and its people. In other words, the fate of the temple and the people correlates directly with God's reputation?i.e., how God's character, authority and actions are perceived.58 ?V)b TO nU2*7, which appears first in 2 Samuel 7:13 and is picked up again in 1 Kings 8:17-20, 44 and 48, is a complex phrase with various possi ble and possibly coincident meanings.59 In 2 Samuel, the phrase suggests two wordplays: it juxtaposes 1) making David a great name (v. 9) and building a house for YHWH's name and 2) building a house for YHWH s dwelling (v. 5) with building a house for his name (v. 13).60 In the first wordplay, both David and YHWH stand to benefit from the relationship. Greatness will be connected with David, probably signifying 57) Deuteronomy, however, does not specify a temple, only the place where YHWH will choose to place his name. 58) Solomon uses this fact as his leverage in appealing to YHWH's character, authority and rep utation to incite YHWH to respond with forgiveness to the prayers offered toward the temple. He uses the same tactic in his appeal to God to establish the Davidic dynasty (e.g. w. 56-60). 59) On the use of the name in 2 Sam 7:23 and 26, see above. 60) Richter picks up on the second while ignoring the first (so Mettinger, review of Richter, p. 755). She appeals to occurrences of the formula b + to support her proposal, concluding that the combination most often connotes "the reputation of an individual, a memorial estab lished for the continued existence of some individual, or simply 'fame' itself (Deuteronomistic History, p. 70 n. 65)". In other words, as some form of dwelling does not feature. However, if, as those who espouse the name theology claim, the use of the name by the Deuteronomist is revolutionary, this absence comes as no surprise. Otherwise, name theology would not be so revolutionary after all (cf. Hurowitz, review of Richter, who claims that "an ad hoc interpreta tion is not necessarily a wrong one"). If we broaden our semantic search to include the verb ?"IH with b and an object, we get the expected result: the phrase refers to an individual's physical dwelling (e.g. 2 Sam 5:11; cf. 1 Chr 14:1, 2 Chr 2:2, where the Tyrians build a house for David). The special usage in 2 Samuel 7:27 plays on the straightforward meaning.</page><page sequence="16">548 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 great deeds and the fame attached to them, while YHWH will receive a tem ple dedicated to him on his terms.61 The parallel between the house for the name and house for a dwelling is more difficult to interpret. If nothing else, it seems to be a clarification. The temple is not to be understood as a dwelling, at least as it is commonly envi sioned. In other words, God is not present in his temple in the same way a monarch is present in his palace. Nonetheless, one cannot altogether deny presence, since attaching YHWH s name to the temple attaches his reputa tion to its welfare and, thus, warrants some form of presence. Since Solomon is the promised temple builder, 1 Kings 8 naturally picks up on the phrase.62 Outside of its new rhetorical thrust, the phrase seems to carry the same meaning as it did in 2 Samuel 7. The phrases UV *&gt;W? nVT? TYinb (1 Kgs 8:16) and ?V) *Ott&gt; ?T?T (29) are akin to the much publicized phrases, DU) and DU&gt; ?Wb.63 They suggest a substantial link between YHWH and the temple, such that YHWH is bound by his covenant, character and reputation to govern justly. In verses 33 and 35, YHWH is equated with his name.64 Here, Solomon asks God to respond with forgiveness when the people confess his name?i.e. repent from their sin and both acknowledge and submit to God s authority. Verse 42 mentions hearing of God's great name, which is his fame elicited by all that he is and has done and the publication of both. Verse 43 contains two references to the divine name. In the first, Solomon uses God's reputation to inspire him to respond with favor so that all know his name and his ability to answer prayer and, as a result, appropriately fear him. The second refers to the house called by YHWH's name and is a statement of ownership.65 61) The relationship between YHWH and Israel in general and YHWH and David in particular brings additional renown. The use of God's name appears in this context (w. 23, 26) in the first instance so that God may become known by publicizing his name and, in the second, so that this publicized name be magnified (Vu) forever. In these usages, name refers to God's reputa tion developed on the basis of his great deeds that establish his power and relational fidelity, the former relating to the Exodus event and the latter to the establishment of the Davidic dynasty. 62) Richter, Deuteronomistic History, p. 79. 63) Ibid., pp. 85-89.

Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 549 Evidence in the Bible and ANE that Connect the Name to Presence In the ANE, the name is inextricably linked to the named. Throughout the ANE, curses attached to monuments and building inscriptions threaten dire punishment to any who dare damage the monument or the name it bears.66 The name, even in written form, is so closely attached to the person bearing it that to damage the name is to damage the person.67 If the name is destroyed, it all but assures that the person will be as well (while intact the name and its monument carry on the persons existence, even in death).68 66) Cf. Bahrani, Graven Image, p. 174. Pace Richter, Deuteronomistic History, this seems to sug gest more than a mere concern for continued good reputation. The treatment of royal monu ments by foreigners provides a striking example of the (perceived) threat of damaging one's monument. When taken into captivity, monuments of foreign kings bearing their image and name were often mutilated; heads, hands and feet were cut off (see P. O. Harper, J. Aruz, and F. Talion [eds.], The Royal City ofSusa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre [New York, 1992], pp. 159-182, referring to Susa). In at least one case, the mutilation of a copper head relates to identical Median torture methods (C. Nylander, "Earless in Nineveh: Who Mutilated 'SargonV Head?" AJA 84 [1980], pp. 329-335). In Hazor, all cases of mutilation, usually of cult statues, involve cutting off the head and hands, which is incidentally the same fate of Dagan in lSa 5:4 (A. Ben-Tor, "The Sad Fate of Images and Statues at Hazor", in S. Gitin, J. E. Wright and J. P. Dessel [eds.], Confronting the Past: Archaeological and Historical Essays on Ancient Israel in Honor of William G Dever [Winona Lake, IN, 2007]). There are even records of kings being brought to trial in absentia with only their monuments present as a substitute (Bahrani, Graven Image, p. 179; I. T. Abusch, Babylonian Witchcraft Literature: Case Studies [BJS 132; Atlanta, 1987], p. 87). Thus, in addition to the political and propagandistic effect (Richter, Deuterono mistic History, p. 138), it seems that the Mesopotamians believed that the fate of one's image and its name affected, if not determined, the fate of the individual himself (see following note). In Egypt as well, the name plays a significant role; see esp. the usurpation of monuments and the rubbing out of the name. A primary way of avoiding this fate is to inscribe the name so deeply into the stone that it cannot be effaced (see esp. the inscriptions of Ramses II). 67) In Ancient Egypt, e.g., "destruction of the name brought annihilation, denying a person eternal life and reducing him or her to a state of perpetual death" (S. Quirke, Ancient Israelite Religion [New York, 1992], pp. 111-112). 68) This mindset may have roots in the Mesopotamian worldview (the following is a simplifica tion of its complex nature). Since the gods inscribe their wills into creation itself, one may pre dict one's fate by correctly interpreting omens. In such a context, the fate of anything closely associated with a person?in the case of the king, his name and monuments?is inextricably linked with the fate of the person himself. When omens portend doom for the king, elaborate rituals are devised to avert it. In the king substitution ritual, the most prominent of these, a substitute king (human image) is transformed into the real king through ritual so that he may suffer in the original king's stead. The name, both spoken and inscribed, as well as the image, are essential elements in this transformation. Each is a metonym, a partial presence that cap tures some but never all of the essence. To arrive at plenitude, one needs to combine all of these elements through the medium of ritual. Only then does the image become the king (Bahrani,</page><page sequence="18">550 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 In votive inscriptions, placed either in the courtyard for all to see or in the sanctuary for the god to see, the image and the name ensure the real presence of the worshiper before the gods. The monument acts as a substitute pres ence.69 In the sanctuary, it functions as and on behalf of the person, effec tively and continually serving and petitioning the gods.70 In the courtyard, it serves both a memorial and a practical function. It reminds the passersby of the monument bearer, while at the same time petitioning them to read the inscription aloud, invoking blessing on the individual named. It seems, then, that in the ANE the name is part of the complex nexus that constitutes a person. When appropriately combined with other attributes, it can denote presence, even at times functioning as a full, substitute presence. Even in isolated form, the treatment of the name, whether written or spoken, has a real effect on the person, serving as much more than just a sign of reputation. In the Hebrew Bible as well, the name (D$) is inextricably linked to the named, functioning at times like a metonym. Since the name of YHWH and YHWH himself are so closely connected, the name is often used interchange ably with YHWH.71 The name also takes on various attributes of God as if it were in fact God72 and at times suggests presence.73 However, like the glory, Graven Image, pp. 128-138, 173-184; cf. C. Daxelm?ller and M. Thomsen, "Bildzauber im alten Mesopotamien", Anthropos 1/2 [1982], p. 55). 69) For the Hittites, see H. A. Hoffner, "The Royal Cult of Hatti", in G. M. Beckman and T. J. Lewis (eds.), Text, Artifact and Image: Revealing Ancient Israelite Religion (BJS 346; Providence, RI, 2006), p. 151; for the Mesopotamians, see Machinist, "Kingship and Divinity in Imperial Assyria", in Text, Artifact and Image, pp. 176, 178, 180. 70) By putting a monument in the divine presence, the king frees himself from the responsibil ity of daily entering the temple to serve and petition the gods. In the ancient world as today, people looked for shortcuts, ways of avoiding doing the work themselves (see, e.g., the ushabtis of Ancient Egypt, who served the dead in the afterlife, thereby relieving them of menial labor). 71) See references in HALOT II.3.a; van der Woude, TLOT3, p. 1362; Reiterer, TDOTXV. 72) E.g., the name protects (Ps 20:2), is blessed (Ps 96:2), praised (69:31), to be feared (Deut 28:58), trusted in, hoped in (Ps 52:9) and glorified (86:9); cf. the plea in Ps 54:3 to save by his name. See especially in this regard, Exod 33:19 and 34:5-6, where proclaiming the name means proclaiming Gods character and conduct (YHWH expresses his freedom in exercising grace and compassion). 73) So Mettinger, Dethronement, pp. 124-129. In Ex 20:23-24, God promises his presence and blessing in every place he causes his name to be remembered, places marked by simple altars and sacrifice instead of idols (R?it?rer, TDOTXV, p. 140). The name itself, used interchange ably with YHWH, approaches (R?it?rer, TDOTXV, p. 159; van der Woude, TLOT3, p. 1363; pace Mettinger, Dethronement, p. 130) (Isa 30:27; cf. Ps 75:2) (Here the use of name also seems to suggest his "terrifying majesty" [van der Woude, TLOT3, p. 1363]).</page><page sequence="19">M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 551 it can be distinguished from God himself.74 Like YHWH and his glory, the name and YHWH are so intimately allied that the two could be equated yet distinguishable enough that the one does not encapsulate the other. Thus, in both the ANE and in the Bible, the name is substantially bound to the named. In Mesopotamia, the treatment of the name affects the indi vidual ontologically. With the image, it also functions as an appropriate stand-in for the person. In the Bible, the name often serves as a metonym, used interchangeably with God, attracting his attributes and suggesting his presence yet ultimately to be differentiated from him. What Then Does This Suggest About Divine Presence? Does the Deuteronomistic Historian build on this precedent? In other words, does the presence of the name in D and Dtr actually signify the presence of the person? The evidence is ambiguous, since, in reference to divine presence, the name formulae are ambivalent, suggesting various possible meanings. Either God is 1) present in some form, perhaps approaching hypostasis, or 2) fully present as in Zion-Sabaoth theology but unnaturally so, truly belong ing in heaven yet unbound by the confines of both, or 3) present only in heaven so that the temple is merely a forwarding station. The contexts render the third option unlikely for various reasons. The Deuteronomistic history uses language that suggests some form of divine presence, while a total abandonment of divine presence in the earthly sphere seems to be too extreme a departure from earlier theories. Likewise, the con text and uniqueness of 1 Kings 8 mitigates its extreme language; one must be cautious in applying this text unilaterally since the stress on divine presence in heaven appears nowhere else so forcefully. As mentioned above, divine presence forms bookends to the chapter, while the chapter nowhere explicitly denies divine presence on earth.75 In addition, the nature of the chapter's 74) For example, although the name is present in the temple and often used interchangeably with God, the people only serve, sacrifice and bow down to God, never to the name (Reiterer, TDOTXV, pp. 140, 162, 165); cf. ibid., p. 170: "Name and word constitute a special mode of God's presence, which nevertheless preserves a difference between the divine plenitude and human experience". 75) The qualification of God's presence in verse 27 is a particularly interesting example. It states that both earthly and heavenly dwellings are ultimately unfit for YHWH. Nonetheless, the text still calls heaven God's dwelling place. Thus, it seems to be affirming that, although heaven can not contain his greatness, it is his dwelling nonetheless. This opens up the possibility that earth may indeed be a divine dwelling place even if it is unfit for him and unable to encapsulate him.</page><page sequence="20">552 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 petition and the nature of the one being petitioned also lend clarity to the situation, or at least suggest caution in offering too hasty a conclusion. If the Deuteronomist wants to qualify previous understandings of divine presence, putting his argument in the mouth of Solomon on this particular occasion is a masterstroke. As the vassal, Solomon adopts the posture of a servant and, as such, uses humble language. He is not willing to presume, at least not in speech, that the all-powerful God will choose to dwell in the house that he has made, especially when its construction was initiated by David and not God. In addition, flattery would be an appropriate way to elicit a favorable response to Solomon's petitions. Thus, when Solomon says that God dwells in heaven and appeals to God bursting the confines of heaven and earth (v. 27), he is extolling God's greatness to curry favor. This need not suggest that God will not dwell in the temple as he dwells in heaven. It only suggests that Solomon will not presume such a presence, thereby leaving the freedom of choice rightly in the suzerain's hands. After eliminating the possibility that YHWH is only present in heaven, we are left with some form of mysterious presence. Instead of despairing at the ambiguity, we should recognize the brilliance of the Deuteronomist who, with the multivocal yet ambiguous name, ensures some form of presence yet shrouds that presence in mystery. The Deuteronomist thereby frees God from unnecessary limits and misunderstanding. In doing so, he also chooses a term that fits perfectly in context. When placed in a covenantal context that stresses the mutual benefits and obligations of YHWH and Israel, attaching YHWH's name to the temple keeps YHWH's benefits and obligations in the forefront. It simultaneously serves to nuance previous conceptions of divine presence. Implications of Using Name Language in Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic History The Deuteronomist's principal contribution lies not in moving God to heaven but in leaving undefined God's presence on earth. Rather than being a substitute presence or merely a descriptor of hegemony, the name (DU)) serves to simultaneously guarantee YHWH's practical presence and to abstract the nature of that presence. It ensures that God is present enough to act on The stress on heavenly presence would then seem to be a corrective against unnecessarily limit ing God to a terrestrial, anthropomorphic abode.</page><page sequence="21">M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 553 Israel's behalf for the sake of his name, while shrounding the nature of his presence in mystery to prevent unnecessary divine limitations. The presence of YHWH's name in the temple expresses God's practical yet ineffable presence. The name is an especially appropriate choice because of both its multivocality and its ambiguity, using both to express complexity while counseling caution. It may at once capture a complex nexus of ideas into one word and preserve substantial mystery about the nature of that nexus. In our case, the name communicates that God attaches himself?more particularly his authority, character and reputation?to the temple, yet he does so without revealing the nature of his presence. Dtr seems unwilling to entirely abandon God's presence on earth and the reassurance it provides or to allow for misunderstandings of and limitations of the God who is present. By placing the name in the temple Dtr is able to strike a balance. On the one hand, God's presence on earth in the ambiguous form of his name ensures some form of divine presence. Even if the name does not ensure physical presence, it does ensure practical presence, which is a reassurance the people need. The Deuteronomist's use of the name attaches YHWH to the temple so that his power, character, actions and reputation are intimately connected with it and the people who worship in it. By making such a con nection, YHWH binds himself to act on behalf of Israel for his own name's sake. Thus, the people are assured that their God is practically present to act as their God to bless the obedient, punish the disobedient and forgive the repentant.76 On the other hand, the ambiguity surrounding YHWH's presence pre serves his ineffability. First, the Deuteronomistic language serves as an appro priate corrective to anthropomorphic understandings of God, where God is like a powerful king who dwells in an earthly temple.77 It expresses in its own way the unnatural and precarious nature of divine presence on earth78 by claiming that God's true home is in heaven, yet, in the end, YHWH is so 76) 1 Kings 9:3 lends weight to this proposal. Whatever else it may mean, juxtaposing God's name with his eyes and heart suggests intimate attention, if not presence. 77) In Deuteronomy in particular, we encounter such phrases as YHWH meeting face-to-face with the people (5:4), being among the Israelites ( ) and walking/going in their midst Cf?n) (Wilson, Out of the Midst, pp. 202, 206; cf. R. S. Kawashima, "The Priestly Tent of Meeting and the Problem of Divine Transcendence: An 'Archaeology' of the Sacred", Journal of Religion 86/2 [2006], p. 257). 78) Cf. . D. Sommer, "Conflicting Constructions of Divine Presence in the Priestly Taberna cle", Biblnt 9 (2001), p. 61, and Kawashima, "Priestly Tent", pp. 256-257, both in reference to P.</page><page sequence="22">554 M. Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 great that not even heaven can contain him (1 Kgs 8:27). As a corrective to simplistic anthropomorphisms, the Deuteronomist contends that God does not need a house on earth, nor can he in any way be encapsulated by it. Second, the divine presence and the nature of the divinity himself are shrouded in greater mystery than in the rest of the ANE and in the rest of the Bible as well. Whereas ANE deities had statues and thrones, the Deuter onomistic account allows for neither of these. Unlike the ANE, none may approach this God or even understand his presence.79 In fact, there is no clear assurance that God is physically present at all. Like the glory in P, the name in D and Dtr is a metonym of sorts that cap tures some of the divine essence yet does not encapsulate the whole. How ever, it goes beyond even in abstracting the divine presence. While P's glory is a visual metonym that necessitates a tangible presence, the name is concep tual, establishing a substantial connection between God and his name yet doing so without any promise of physical presence. Third, ample mystery without ample anthropomorphisms protects against the weaknesses of the ANE conception of divine presence. In D and Dtr as in the ANE, one could theoretically distinguish between God and his manifestation (name or statue). However, it is not natural to do so. The Deuteronomist minimizes the difficulties of such an association in two ways, by freeing YHWH from any limits to form and place. The Deuteronomist accomplishes the former by absenting God from any cult statue or from any physical form at all. Thus, there is no idol to be destroyed or deported, nor is there an image to be copied and misappropriated (e.g. by creating multiple YHWHs). The Deuteronomist frees God from the confines of space by speak ing of his dual presence. The God who makes his continual home in heaven may also dwell, or at least be present, in some capacity on earth. In the end, YHWH transcends fixed location just as he transcends full description.80 79) As in the priestly texts, the fire at Sinai serves as a veil in Deuteronomy that conceals God's form while it reveals his location. 80) This dual presence may be an outflow of the description of YHWH as God/creator of heaven and earth (present in Gen 14:19, 22, 24:3 [attributed J], Deut 4:39, 10:14, Josh 2:11 [attributed to D and Dtr], Exod 31:17 [attributed to P], and Gen 2:4 [at the join between and J]). The God and creator of both would naturally be present on both. It is also possible that the dual presence in D and Dtr is not simultaneous as in Zion-Sabaoth theology. God may be present on earth only on special occasions, deigning to visit earth for the giving of the law, the inauguration of the temple, and the reception of sacrifices.</page><page sequence="23">M Hundley I Vetus Testamentum 59 (2009) 533-555 555 Although some clanger remains of the name (DU)) usurping the Name ( ),81 especially when the former is used to qualify the latter,82 the Deuter onomist and his culture took steps to minimize the risk. With a clearly defined and centralized priesthood, a substantial oral and emerging written tradition, and no imagery of God or his name, the name of God evokes God in his person as expressed in Israelite sacred tradition?his character, his deeds, and the reactions they elicit. In fact, his name gives definition to his identity, without which his various qualities would be disembodied or, worse yet, misassigned.83 Similarly, God's ambiguous presence, alongside the people's culpability, helps preserve his inviolability. Although his reputation may suffer with the destruction of the temple and the people's defeat, his power and character remain untarnished. God's name can neither be destroyed, defeated nor deported.84 At the same time, the peoples defeat is not YHWH's defeat. By expanding on the conditions hinted at in Zion-Sabaoth theology, the Deu teronomist puts the fault squarely on the people's shoulders. YHWH protects and blesses Zion and its people when they deserve to be protected and blessed. He even exceeds the minimal requirements, providing for and pro tecting the people when they repent of their wrongdoing. Although such an apologia provides a rationale for God's behavior and a defense of his unsur passed power and character, it cannot entirely protect YHWH's reputation.85 This is the price YHWH pays for aligning himself with Israel and its temple. In a corpus that wants to preserve earthly presence while preventing mis understanding of the divine, the name (DU)) is an especially appropriate term, as it captures the best of both worlds. The name asserts YHWH's practical presence in the temple to reassure the people, yet equivocates about its nature to avoid divine limitation. 81) For such usurpations in the ANE world, see Mettinger, Dethronement, pp. 129-132 and ref erences cited therein. See also the modern Jewish tendency to refer to God as D$n to protect against misuse of the divine name. 82) E.g., in D and Dtr, when the name serves as a means of abstracting the divine presence while maintaining a substantial link with the temple, especially in God's continued attention and covenant fidelity to it and his people. 83) However, ironically, the ambiguity of the term that allows for such complexity of expression and mystery also allows for rival interpretations. 84) Also, without a full (physical) presence, the link between the defeat of his temple and people and his own weakness is more tenuous in Dtr than in the rest of the ANE. 85) YHWH is either considered weak for not defending his temple and people or he is impugned for being unable to control his people's behavior.</page></plain_text>
