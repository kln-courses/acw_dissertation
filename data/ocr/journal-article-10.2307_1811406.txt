<plain_text><page sequence="1">CASSEL'S I'HEORY OF PRICING The publication of an English translation of Cassel's Theoretische Sozialikonomie' is an event which merits more than usual notice. From the standpoint of American usage, however, the title of the work is misleading. One who takes up the book under the impression that it deals with the ethical implications of economics or anything sociological will be quickly disillusioned. Cassel ranges strictly with the price economists. He means by a social economy simply an exchange economy.' Cassel aims at a wholly objective analysis in terms of price. There has never been, he thinks, a developed exchange economy without a standard of value- money. Hence, he rejects the term value. To be sure, he treats price "merely in its function as a common scale of reckoning in all economic valuations" (p. 48)-a sort of social book- keeping-but this is sufficient as the basis for an analysis of the pricing process in quantitative terms. T'he assumption that a "pure exchange economy" preceded the monetary economy, the "very vague and elastic idea of 'value,' " and the attempt to construct a theory of subjective value, have proved fatal, he thinks, to the development of a scientific economics. It follows that the subjective value theory ought to be excluded, and that the theoretical exposition of the exchange economy must include money from the start, and must therefore be essentially a theory of the fixing of prices (pp. 49-51). The volume falls into two parts, the first comprising a general survey of the exchange economyr and the pricing of the factors of production, the second covering money and business cycles.' We confine our attention to the first part, which is essentially the theory of value and distribution. Here the author makes his most original and striking contribution, which lles in his attempt to construct a theory of price (value) in terms of the mnarlket process-his so-called pricing process-as a whole. His treatment of the problem involves an extraordinarv emphasis oin the fact of scarcity, and a rejection not only of all marginal concepts, both of utility and of productivity, but of all residual theories of distribution, including the Ricardian rent theory, and of all linear theories of value, that is, theories which 'The Theory of Social Economy, translated by Joseph McCabe from the third German edition. (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1923. Pp. xiv, 654.) 2Cassel uses the term "economy" or "the economy" in the sense of the economic system.

As may be guessed, Cassel employs no psvchological data, and only incidently does he mnake any employment of the genetic or historical method. His method is rigid deductive logic. For him economics is distinctly a normative science. His system is a kind of economic idealism, in that he presents a theory of price mechanism in a perfectly balanced and perfectly functioning exchange economiy. His theory is therefore an analysis of what ought to be, of unescapable tendencies, of ideal universals, and, bv implication, of finalities. Since he seeks to find principles tr-ue of any developed exchange economy, even of socialisnm, it would be harsh to apply the term apologetic to his system; yet the net import of his tlhought is to establish the present system as on the whole a reasonable approximation to the demands of ideal economy. Yet, curiously, he conceives of himself as a realist. He believes that he is presenting the "economic nceessities." Economic science should "describe as such the processes which are essential to every economv" (p. 12). It must view actual economic life "as a whole, and try to describe and explain it as it actually exists" (p. 11). It "has...... to describe the economic facts, as they are found in real life, and explain them and their inner connections" (p. 65).4 If this means concrete realism, there is very little of it in this volume, with the exception of the chapters on money and cycles, and of some telling critical passages, such as those aimed at Ricardian doctrine and the one exposing the unreality of the assumption of free competition (pp. 112 if.). If, on the other hand, it means an attempt to see the essential nature of the market process, stripped of the institutional influences and changes which obscure it, and which, according to Professor Young, make of the institutional economist a mere impressionist,: then there is a great deal of realism, in this volume, a refreshing amount in fact, when compared to the strained constructions of some classicists and the dubious mnarginalist theories. The explanation of this seeming inconsistency between a teleogical idealism and an attempt at realism in the same book is to be found, if at all, by reference to the function of scientific imagination. It takes a powerful imagination, as well as observation and logic, to simplify so complex a thing as the economic process, even mechanically considered, to the point where it is amenable to systematic analysis. 'He immediately qualifies this, however, by referring to the unmanageableness of of the vast detail of economic life, and by stating that details are to be ignored and only the "normal" and typical taken.

Orthodox economics has one system of constructive-imagination concepts, with its cost, utility, and productivity theories, its residual theories, its method of differences, etc. Socialism has another. Genetic and institutional economics endeavors to derive the premises of whatever theoretical system it may arrive at from a mass of historical and statistical data, so bulky and unwieldy, for all their inadequacy, that here again we must undoubtedly expect to meet with conceptual generalizations and simplifications not based wholly on statistically provable objectiv-e experience. The essential difference between Cassel and other orthodox theorists lies in the way he images the economic process as a whole. Where they see sacrifice and utility, the play of real cost and intensity of demand, he sketches his economic picture with the bold, hard lines of the inter- play of prices restricting amounts demanded to the available scarce supplies. Where they, as a rule, provide some kind of background of political and social values, he concentrates our whole attention on the foreground of the price mechanisim. This selective emphasis mav be regarded as highly impressionistic; for the effect and the truth of the picture depend upon the depth of its background and its perspec- tive. Cassel's picture may be likened to a dry-point etching of a landscape full of color. Where, then, is his realism? It lies within the limits of the fore- ground of pricing, anid consists of his attempt to image the mechanism of the pricing process as an organized and indivisible whole. In this organization of prices, there is no one fundamental point of departure and no straightaway line of causation. Prices constitute a system, and all prices are fixed simultaneously (p. 89). "Economic science," he says, "has wasted a good deal of time in controversies as to whether one or another group of unknowv elements in the price-fixing process was to be regarded as cause or effect. It is time to cut all such discussions out of our science" (p. 98). "In the actual economic life all the unknown factors of the price- fixing process depend upon each other, and they are only determinied, and then all determined together, when we solve the problem of pricing" (p. 97).6 This conception of process, true as it may be, loses some- what in realism, it must be admitted, when Cassel comes to the final solution of the price problem and finds it only in a heroic mathematical 6This idea is not original to Cassel.

Wolfe [March abstraction; but that does not negate the fact that he has tried to state the problem with theoretical correctness. Despite the fact that Cassel, in his search for economic universals, writes in the best spirit of English classicism, there are many heterodox definitions, points of view, and theories in his book. He may be said to hold much the same place in the orthodox fold that the Modernists now hold in relation to the Fundamentalists in the church. He retains the idealism of the old faith; but he is valiant to rid it of fictions, and he does not hesitate, because a doctrine is hallowed by the prestige of age and acquiescence, to call it a myth if he thinks it. The reader taking up the book for the first time will be saved somne perplexity if he discerns, betimes, that Cassel's economic philosophy is highly teleological. He lays down at the outset, in an admirable in- troduction to the economic ideal, certain postulates or principles, chief of which are the "general economic principle" and the "principle of scarcity."7 Thereafter, throughout the analysis of the pricing pro- cess, including the pricing of the factors of production (distribution), he continually informs us that such and such a result is inevitable because the economic principle "required" it, or because it is "in accordance" with the principle of scarcity He appears to think of a "principle" or law, not as a short-hand statement of the way things act, but rather as a statute or an edict enjoining or necessitating a certain line of action. His language, if not his thought, is thus prevolutionary, if not prescientific. Herein lies his teleology-that he identifies law with necessity and purpose. Not in one but in a score of places he speaks of the "aim," the "object," of prices, of interest, etc. "The fixing of prices ...... has the socio-economic a-im of restricting the demand for goods ........" (p. 66). Prices are paid for the factors of production "in accordance with" the general princi- ple of scarcity, because "it is necessary" to restrict the demand for them . (p. 60). It is the "object" of interest to check the demand for the services of durable goods ...... (p. 212). The "general object" of fixing prices ...... has the same significance for the use of land as for the command of capital (p. 263). In such passages, his conception of economics as a normative science is revealed. His logic boils down to an "if." If the principle or ideal of economy (the best possible satisfaction of wants, the most efficient use of the means of production) is to be realized, certain conditions must obtain, certain things must follow. Centrally and fundamentally, price-fixing must restrict demand. But to say that "The general economic principle involves (1) that "in given conditions, the best possible satisfaction of needs shall be effected" (p. 10); (2) that "the means of production shall be used in the best possible manner" (p. 64). The principle of scarcity means that demand must be restricted to available supply (p. 7).</page><page sequence="5">1.926] Ca8sel's Theory of Pricing 63 this is the "aim" of price, or the "object" of interest (for example), is to come dangerously near to an anthropomorphic conception of the social organization. It is a variant of the old theological argument from design. Properly speaking, interest has no such "object." That may be its effect, but the only object in charging, or in paying, interest is to get an income from capital;' and the only object (short of wartime rationing and governmental price-fixing) of price is to charge what the traffic will bear, cover costs, and make a profit.' Cassel's entire price theory, including his discussion of distribution, is essentially static. He makes effective analytical use of his distinc- tion between a "stationary" and a "progressive" economy (pp. 29-42); but it is not a distinction between static and dynamic as these terms are ordinarily understood. Cassel's "progress" implies nothing ethical or ameliorative; it does not necessarily involve even any technological change. An economy is progressive if it succeeds in maintaining a given per capita output for an increasing population. Progress is taken "only in the quantitative sense ...... of increased production" (p. 34). Only occasionally, as for instance in his treatment of business cycles and his discussion of the demand for capital, does Cassel approach a real (cultural and technological) dynamic point of view. His whole habit of thought is inimical to such an approach, for he excludes from economic theory ("economics proper") practically all institutional influences. The general theory of pricing (chapter 3, "The economic principle in the exchange economy") is the central feature of the book, doctrine which is developed and applied through more than six hundred pages. The nucleus of thd whole theory is that any one price is a function of all prices and cannot be determined until all are determined "together and simultaneously." Davenport and Taylor are practically the only American economists who have attempted to deal with the value problem in this way. First, Cassel assumes an order of "importance" of wants, the onlv measure of which is price. The apportioning of goods in the order of importance of wants, as the economic principle "requires," is ac- complished by the fixing of prices in accordance with the scarcity of the respective goods. The pricing process is described essentially, though not so called, as a trial-and-error method of ascertaining what the traffic will bear. Demand (by which Cassel always means amount demanded), which price must equate with supply, depends not only on "Exception to this statement may be made in the case of central bank regulation of the discount rate in the interest of general business stability. 91t is interesting to note that in appendix I, Cassel states that rationing is the only new element introduced by wartime practice which price theory need take account of.

Wolfe F1MAarcli the price of the good in question but on the simultaneous prices of all other goods, a fact which invalidates the conventional theory that the value of a good depends upon the marginal utility or vendibility of that good alone.'0 Instead of demnand being a determinant of price, there- fore, it is nearer Cassel's conception to say that price determiiines demand."' "It suffices," he says, "for the solution of prices if we assume that the demand for each of the articles in question is settled as soon as the prices of these articles are fixed" (p. 80). Being in possession of this fact, "a tangible fact of quantitative, arithmetical nature," we need not analyze the psychology of demand. Inasmuch, however, as amnount demanded depends on price and price on amount demanided, it is not clear how any one price, or all prices, can ever be fixed. To the extent that we can venture to apply the hedonistic calculus at all, a market price is the resultant of two forces, two desire-intensities, operating in the presence of a given supply of the good (together with the supplies of whatever alternative goods, and goods makinig competinig strains on the budget, it may be worth while to take into consideration). Sellers are constantly testing out the intensity of the desire to buy, and buyers the intensity of the desire to sell. The result is an equilibrium price, arrival at which is conditioned by the scarcity of the good. But this scarcity, which Cassel so emphasizes, is not the absolute thing that he comes near to making it. A good is scarce only in relation to the number and in- tesity of the desires for it." Within the limits set by the individual's income, it is these which determine intensity of demand, and thence the amount demanded at any giveni price. We can agree with Cassel's statement, made in criticismn of the marginal utility tlleory, that the individual's "whole scheme of reckon- ing is necessarily bounid up with the actual prices"' (p. 82), and that "the valuation oI goods ...... is, in the long runi, merely the decisioil what will be consumed in view of actual prices" (p. 84); but we must add that what the actual prices happen to be depends on how muchl sellers can induce buyers to pay, and this on the intensity of the demand as well as the size of the supply. Cassel's attempt to exclude the subjective factor is therefore impractical and illogical; for it leaves out of account an element essential to a correct understanding I'The difference between Cassel's analysis and the more conventional presentation is one of emphasis. There are few economists who have not incidentally pointed out the competing appeals of different goods to the consumer. uCompare Davenport, "The margins are the points at which and not by which, the price is fixed."-Economics of Enterpjise, 1913, p. 54.

We shall see that he later, almost casually, but necessarily, introduces the sub- jective element. When he comes to the pricing of the means of production and to the relation between money cost and price, Cassel continues his analysis in terms of his fundamental concepts of scarcity and the necessity of restricting demand. His teleological idealism centers his attention so exclusively on this necessity that it seems not to occur to him that supply is often, if not habitually, restricted in order, through high prices, to secure greater profits or to "save the market." In actual business life, this restriction of supply may be prompted either by sheer monopolistic motives, by the desire of producers, organized formally or informally into trade associations, to escape real competition and to apply monopolistic principles of price-fixing, or by the desire of actually competing producers (for instance, farmers and fruit growers) to avoid overproduction in their particular industry, that is, the production of so large a supply that it can be sold only at a price which will not cover actual costs.1" Cassel's continual insistence on this supposedly ever-present necessity of "restricting wants"" is in due accord with classical emphasis, which, lhowever, was crystallized before the full effects of the industrial revolution and the tremendous productivity of the machine process had had a chance to make them- selves felt. Today, it is pertinent to raise the question: If so great a need exists to restrict demiand, why do we actually have so much com- petitive advertising and so much blatant "salesmanship" ?" If we for the moment forget the wide discrepancy between Cassel's idealism and the actual conditions of the miarket process, we may see in his analysis of the place of entrepreneur's cost in the pricing process (pp. 87-98, 134-152) a noteworthy attempt to avoid the circular reasoning and the restricted scope of the conventional cost theories, and to put money cost in proper perspective with regard to -the whole valuation process. The usual theory, as many have pointed out,'8 begs "'It is this last-mentioned case which Veblen, in his otherwise penetrating analysis of "capitalistic restriction of output," fails to take into consideration. See The Theory of Business Enterprise, 1904, chapters 3 and 4; The Engineers and the Price System, 1921, chapter 1; and The Vested Interests, 1919, passim. 140ne cannot help wondering how Cassel would fit the Stevenson scheme of "stabilizing" the price of rubber into his thought of "necessity."

Wolf e [March the question, because the money cost of production, which is taken to determine price of product, is itself determined by the prices of the means of production, and these, in turn, are fixed with reference to the prices which can be obtained for the product. Amnerican economists, as a rule, with the exceptioni of Davenport and Taylor as already noted, have either ignored this dilemiimic circle or been oblivious to it. Cassel's theory, whether successful or not, miay therefore be regarded as an outstanding contributioi. A very brief outline of hiis thought must suffice. We start with the question, "What kinds of goods are to be produced"? Since price- offers are the mleasure of the importance of wants, the same standard nmust hold for the regulation of production. The solution of the problem is, therefore, to fix uniform prices for the means of productionl and to determine the prices of finiished goods in accordance with these prices. By properly pricinig the nmeans of production, consumers' demands cani be restricted so that they can be met by the relatively scarce ineanis of production. We thus determine both demand and the entire direction of production (pp. 87-88). "Once prices have been fixed for the means of production, a price will be calculated for each finished product corresponding to the total price of all the means of production required for preparing it" (p. 89). This obviously is only a way of saying that once we know cost of production we have the price of the product. It looks like a straightforward cost-of-pro- duction explanation of value. But it is not. Cost of production, we are immediately informed, is not the determining factor in the price of the product, because cost is not an independent entity (p. 90). The opposite idea that the prices of the means of production are determined by the prices of the finished products is also rejected, because "there is no gradation of prices in the sense that some of them are deter- mining factors of the others" (p. 91). But the fact that "all the unknown factors of the pricing process depend upon each other," and that "they are ...... all determined together ...... does not prevent us from, in the meantime, taking the prices of the means of production for granted" (p. 97), and so formulating the "principle of cost," which is that "every finished article receives a price that corresponds to the price of producing it" (p. 91). Since this "principle of cost" plays so important a role in the author's theory fromi here on, it is unifortunate that he does not at once take pains to make clear exactly what he means by it. In view of the theory of the simultaneousness and mutual interrelatedness of all values, the reader is puzzled when told that "the principle of cost is the proper starting-point for the study of the economy," that the economy "is to be tested by the way it meets the requirements of the principle</page><page sequence="9">1926] Cassel's Theory of Pricing 67 of cost" (p. 113), and that "pricing in accordance with the principle of cost is to be regarded as the normal procedure" (p. 127). By divination the reader is gradually enabled to infer, however, that by cost Cassel means the level of prices which must be set on the means of production in order to restrict consumers' indirect demand for them to within the limits set by the supply of them. Cost is thus merely the money expression of scarcity,7 and the principle of cost is simply another term for the "principle of scarcity" as applied to the means of production. Now if it be asked by what right Cassel starts his analysis by assuming the prices of the means of production to be already fixed and known, the only answer is that inasmuch as the whole pricing process is circular he has to break in somewhere. The difficulty of obtaining an analysis true to the organized totality of the pricing process lies just in the fact that we have to deal with a closed system of inter- causal relations,'8 and have to make an arbitrary entrance by assumin,g some category of prices (either of finished goods or of the means of production) to be fixed beforehand. It is only after we have carried the analysis around the circle that we are in a position to amend this contrary-to-fact assumption and say that the prices we have assumned as fixed are themselves functions of the variables we have attempted to explain from them. Cassel's final "solution" of the value problem is given in an intricate and extremely abstract quasi-mathematical analysis (chapter 4). It consists theoretically in constructing a set of simultaneous equations containing as many equations as there are unknown quantities, that is, as many as there are prices and quantities to be simultaneously deter- mined. This long discussion of "the intrinsic nature" of the pricing process involves both the circuit flow of money and allocation of savings to provide increased capital for the "steadily progressive economy." At the outset of it, Cassel is compelled to introduce the demand schedule, expressing, in price form, subjective valuations (p. 136), and to affirm that the coefficients of his equations represent both objective and subjective factors. Both, he says now, are essential in the settlenment of prices, and the whole controversy between objective and subjective value theories is a mere waste of time (p. 143). Evi- dently, therefore, the attempt even to state the pricing problem in exclusively objective terms, breaks down. The oft-repeated phrase ggimportance of wants" has concealed a subjective factor from the "TThe author definitely states this (p. 160), in the chapter introductory to his analysis of distrlbution, but not until nearly a hundred pages after the cost principle is first introduced.

There is no way to a fundamental analysis of value or the pricing process without coordinating the intensity of wants on the one hand and the real costs of production, in their influence on scarcity, on the other. Cassel, like Davenport and Taylor, grapples with an extremely complex and tantalizing problem. For this, gratitude is due him. In a sense, the problem is incapable of solution. Certainly no practical application of his mathematical analysis can be imagined; but the attempt to visualize in the mind's eye the unity and totality of the system of prices, and to trace, as fully as may be, the intricate circuit flow of money agaiiist the complex flow of goods, cannot help being of very great aid to the attainment of a symmetrical insight into the nature of our exchange mechanism. Under the title "Supplementary principles of price-fixing," Cassel takes up the modifications to his main line of theory which are necessi- tated by the fact that costs vary for different establishments, and, in the same establishment, with output and the like. As to non-uniform costs between different firms, the price of the product must be high enough to cover the costs of the highest-cost establishment necessary to supply the demand. He calls this the "differential principle" (p. 99). It is the source of differential profits, which (contra J. B. Clark) "are inevitable in the exchange economy." His second principle is that of "pricing at falling average costs" (p. 103). Here he considers costs of a given firm, and points out that at a given time there is no "marginal" cost, but only average cost for the whole output. His discussion of these matters is good, but too sketchy to be satisfactorv. He does niot inake the very essential distinction between differential advantages (as betweeln establishments) which are permanent and those which are not. Nor does he sufficiently emphasize the time element.19 The surprising thing in this connection is that the "normal pro- cedure" is held to be largely independent of anything that can be called free competition. Cassel's discussion (pp. 112-128) of the orthodox assumption of free competition and of the comparative absence of competition in the modern economy is his nearest approach to concrete reality, and is, even as it stands, wholly refreshing. Competition still plays a very important part in modern economic life, but the forms it assumes are totally different from the ideal of free com- petition. The very idea of free competition is obscure ... . It would be very difficult to give a satisfactory positive definition of free competition. The idea of it is, in fact, quite irreconcilable with a matter of great importance in the modern economic life-the economic superiority of the large business. In cases where this superiority makes itself felt, 19Elsewhere he points out how essential it is to keep the time element in mind.</page><page sequence="11">1926] Cassel's Theory of Pricing 69 free competition is logically bound to bring about its own opposite monopoly (p. 1206). Good as his treatment of competition is, however, it needs workiniu over. He has not thought the thing clear through. (Who has?) He sagely remarks, "There can be no free competition as long as the economic individuals are bound together by some organization. Even the social intercourse of people in the same trade is injurious to free competition" (p. 115). But he seems to rely upon the doubtful offices of potential competitioni (p. 127) to cure monopoly power. Just here is a striking instance of his obliviousness to the roles played by capitalistic restriction of output, monopolistic feeling out of what the traffic will bear, and the foisting upon con- sumers, in perpetuity, of charges based upon capitalization of the intangible "assets" thus engendered. Cassel's theory of distribution is a direct outgrowth, or rather an integral part, of his general theory of pricing. The proportions in which the factors of production are used de- pend upon the prices of the factors. The price of a factor depends upon its scarcity, scarcity relative not primarily to the supply of other factors, but to the demand for finished products.20 Uniform prices are set on each factor; and the factors are apportioned among the different branches of production according to the demand for them at these prices (p. 173). Thus we come back to the general pricing piocess. In this method of analysis two features stand out in marked contrast to classical theory, as represented by Marshall, and to the methodology of the specific productivity theorists. Cassel tries to dispense with real costs. And while he admits that a "formally correct" theory can be built up, through the method of differences and application of the principle of substitution, oIn the basis of the marginal productivity of the technologically variable appli- cation of a factor, he regards such a theory as fruitless, in view of the interdependence of price and productivity. He holds that factoral proportion is determined more by prices of the factors than by the part the factors play in the technique of production, and that the marginal productivity of a factor and the relative quantity of it to be used can be determined only when we know the prices of all the factors (pp. 109, 173). Moreover, there is no one "best" technical proportion between the factors.21 Now it ""The problem of the distribution of the total outcome of production is thus primarily settled by the relative scarcity of these factors In proportion to the indirect demand of consumers for them" (p. 174).

Wolfe [Mlarch is certainly true that the amount of a factor used depends upon its price, and this in turn upon its scarcity, not only in relation to consumers' demand, however, but to the other factors as well.q' It is mere theoretic bias to deny, or to belittle the fact that the scarcity of a factor depends significantly upon the part which that factor plays in the technique of production. Technical marginal productivity does not afford the sole basis for the pricing of factors-and hence the key to the determination of wages, interest, and rent-by any means; but it is nevertheless an element which cannot lightly be brushed aside. Here again Cassel conducts us into the circle maze, but the way he points out of it is far from clear. In the case of consumers' goods, the clue to escape lies in consumers' subjective valuations. In that of the means of production, generally speaking, it must lie, at least in part, in the real (sacrifice or disutility) cost of their production. But Cassel will have nothing to do with real costs, except, inconsistently, in the analysis of interest, and, grudg- ingly and incidentally, in that of wages.23 Just as he has failed, until the last moment, to correlate scarcity of finished goods with intensity of consumers' demand, he now fails to recognize that subjective sacri- fices or behavior attitudes of any kind have much to do with the scarcity of the means of production. This attitude toward real cost is due in general to his aversion to admitting any subjective element, and specifically due to the idea (in spite of his contention that land can be created) that real cost affords no basis for the determination of rent and the valuation of land. He is convinced that the whole Ricardian treatment of value and distribution is strained and fallacious. This conviction is probably another reason why he puts so heavy a load on "scarcity," unsupported by real cost. He is opposed to any theory which may lead to the labor theory of value, and thoroughly averse to Ricardo's "residual" method of analysis, because it is at variance with the fundamental principle of the inter- dependence of all prices. Cassel's theory of interest merits, an extended critique, for which we have not space. Having severely criticized Marshall for appealing to real costs, he now himself makes this subjective factor the pivotal point of his theory. It is true that he defines interest as the price of 23Whereas Cassel's reference for a criterion of the scarcity of factors is to the lmited supply of economic goods in general-essentially to the axiomatic dis- tinction between economic goods and free goods,-Marshall's is to the more immediate scarcity of the factors relative to one another. If Cassel perceived that Marshall simply takes for granted the general limitation of supply of economic goods, his strictures on Marshall's treatment of value and distribution might be less severe.

He could have stopped with this and been consistent and fairly convincing. While his argument that the function of interest is to restrict the demand for capital to the "most important" uses is ob- jectionable for its teleological point of view, and by no means wholly convincing as to the necessity of interest, it is arresting and suggestive. But he does not stop here. Thrown off his guard by the substitution of the seductive "waiting" for the frank and more honest "abstinence," he develops essentially a sacrifice or real-cost theory. It is a bit difficult to see how an author who has held that pro- duction is a continuous process, involving no "advances" (pp. 24-29), can later make so much of "waiting." Cassel is right in insisting, with Clark, that production is continuous, and his criticism of the classical theory of advances is thoroughly sound. But if production is continuous, there can be no waiting in the stationary economy, where saving is necessary only for repairs and depreciation.24 Only in the "progressive economy" can true waiting and advances be necessary, for there what Fetter calls cumulative saving is necessary to provide for increase of capital equipment. A release from Cassel's inconsistency may perhaps be found by assuming that in holding production to be continuous he has in mind the productive process as a whole, while in his later discussion of interest he has under consideration, without being entirely conscious of the fact, the economico-legal relation of individuals, some of whom have control, others of whom desire to secure control, of wealth useful in the productive process. In one of his few excursions into concrete economics, he reasons from historical and teclhnological data that the rate of pure interest has not fallen in the past. This may be true, though to establish it would require more knowledge of historical social psychology than we are likely soon to have. Whether it is true or Inot, whien he argues fronm it that the demand for capital, relative to its supply, will not decline in the future, he is, at best, resorting to institutional grounds. He assumes, as he lhas already assumed in his very questionable argument against the possibility of over-saving (pp. 61-63), a continuous growth of population and ani indefinitely extended improveement of machine technique. He simply presupposes that wlhat Taussig2' calls the race between accumulation and invention will always be won by invention- an assumption Taussig is cautious not to make. The historical argui- %4Whether provision for replacement is to be called "saving" is largely a matter of deflnition. Cassel seems unable to decide the exact nature of saving.

JVolfe [ March ment comes far from demonstrating the universal and perpetual necessity of interest. Cassel is not at home in this dynamic field. His final argument for the necessity of interest is his well-known annuity theory, presented to English readers a quarter of a century ago.' While this theory may be logically impervious, it is from the standpoint of psychological probabilities too far-fetched to be ac- ceptable. Nevertheless, this, with other aspects of Cassel's treatment of interest, has not had the attention it deserves from American theorists. He rejects entirely the Ricardian doctrine of rent, since, far from not constituting an element in cost and price, rent is "a regulator of the economically sound use of capital and labor on land, the extent of the cultivated area, and the relative prices of the various products of the land" (p. 279). He minimizes the distinction between rent and quasi-rent, by holding that land can be created, and that at a given moment fixed capital cannot be increased or shifted (pp. 260-263). Profit is dismissed in a few pages. Here he makes an incidental con- tribution in that he regards profit derived from "privileged position"- priority advantages and the like-not as rent of business ability but as "a sort of rent of position" (p. 169). Cassel does not, except perhaps in the case of interest, claim for his theory of distribution according to the principles of pricing more than "in a sense ...... correctness from the economic point of view" (p. 175). This, he says, "is very far from closing the practical problem of distribution," for that problem includes extensive social influences which do not come within the domain of economics proper. Final judgment on Cassel's work must take into consideration his method and his conception of the narrow limits of the sphere proper to the economic theorist. There may be differences of opinion as to what these limits should be and as to what method is likely to prove most productive in the present state of economic knowledge. While Cassel shows occasional flashes of insight into institutional factors, he is not an institutional economist, nor in any but technical German use of the term a "social" economist. It would be ungrateful and fruitless to take him to task for not being one. His work will stand or fall accord- ing to the contribution that a highly abstract and idealistic analysis of the pricing process conceived as an indivisible unit, an analysis divorced from history, social psychology, and ethics, conceived along essentially static lines, and aiming at discovering economic universals, can make to the broader, dynamic, and institutional economics which is now the desire and hope of many of the younger theorists to develop. Unless the reader takes Cassel provisionally on his own ground, he "The Nature and Necessity of -Interest, 1900.</page><page sequence="15">1926] Cassel's T'heory of Pricing 73 will find the book both difficult and irritating, and will probably fail to perceive Cassel's real contribution. If, however, it be admitted that such a deductive, and even teleological and idealistic, method has a place among the methods which may be used in the cooperative attempt to understand the economic mystery, the thoughtful reader will see in Cassel's analysis of the pricing process a brilliant and suggestive body of theory. If a book mnay be judged by the number of questions it raises and the amount of thinking it compels the reader to do, this volume must take a very high rank among the outstanding books on economic theory in the present generation.2 A.
