<plain_text><page sequence="1">FURTHER HELLENISTIC ACROSTICS: ARATUS AND OTHERS BY J. DANIELEWICZ Abstract The author, after a short review of the research to date and the criteria with which to approach the topic, discusses a number of acrostics to be found in Aratus' Phaenomena, Callimachus' Hymns, and Apollonius Rhodius' Argonautica, all of them recendy detected by himself. It turns out that Aratus was particularly fond of inserting syllabic 'gamma-type' acrostics, which should not always be taken as examples of mere art for art's sake since they may allude to, or are supported by, the immediate context. Special attention, nevertheless, is given to the interpretation of a 'regular' acros- tic (???T?, Phaen. 220-4), in which the poet's empathy with nature is emphasised. The examples from Gallimachus (h. 1.60-2; 5.116-9) and Apollonius Rhodius (1.180-4; 2.421-3; 3.1008-11; 4.1489-92) show that the interrelation between the acrostic and its context may have a ludic char- acter when, for instance, the acrostic serves as a kind of humorous autho- rial comment. It is interesting to observe that the acrostics in Gallimachus and Apollonius Rhodius seem to be mostiy connected with important moments in narration. The author also analyses, by way of comparison, a hitherto unnoticed Latin acrostic from Virgil's Eel. 8.42-7: inanis (viz. Love). Since the first acrostic in Aratus' Phaenomena (?????, lines 783- 7) was discovered by Jean-Marie Jacques in I960,1) the text of the poem has been closely scrutinised in this respect by other scholars, but the result has turned out to be very modest.2) The instance dis- cerned by the French scholar was self-evident enough to be com- monly recognised, hence later discussion concentrated exclusively 1) See Jacques 1960. 2) The number of later discoveries (at least those which are widely known) is very limited and can practically be reduced to two laudable ones: one made by Levitan (1979, 57-8), ??S?, in lines 803-6 (another example, S??????? / S-?- M-HI-H, in lines 808-12, allegedly suggesting S??? and cognate words, is less convincing) and one made by Haslam (1992, 201), ??S?, in lines 807-8. I can- not follow Damschen (2004, 104 n. 52) in accepting the example given by Gusset (1995), HXH, in lines 949-51. Cusset, for that matter, enumerates (ibid., 248 ?

DANIELEWICZ on the sense of the term Upte and its adaptability to the closer and broader context of Aratus' work.3) As to the visual aspect, the acrostic in question belongs to the category of the so-called 'gamma-acros- tics' (characterized by the vertical/horizontal match), which is well attested on inscriptions;4) what is unusual in Aratus, is incorporat- ing a thematic word, rather than a proper name, into an acrostic:5) ?ept? ??? ?a?a?? te pe?? t??t?? ??a? ???sa e?d??? ?' e??, ?ept? de ?a? e? ???' ??e???? p?e??at??? pa???? d? ?a? ????e??s? ?e?a?a?? t?t?at?? ?? t??t?t??? f??? ??e????? ????sa ?? ??t?? ??????et' ? ?dat?? ????? ???t??. The &amp;/?/?-acrostic meets every criterion required of the perfect acros- tic, including that of encompassing exacly the adjacent sentence, whereas the acrostic identified by William Levitan (lines 802-6), visually also of the 'gamma' type, is much inferior in this respect. Its formal imperfection, however, is compensated for by repetition of grammatical variants of the key word in line 805: ?. 11) more acrostics used by Aratus. Since his footnote seems to have escaped the attention of students of the subject, I will quote verbatim its relevant part: "On peut encore rep?rer ?pa?e aux vers 220-224, aet?? aux vers 236-240, ????? [sic] aux vers 658-662, f??a aux vers 867-870, ?p? aux vers 1007-1009 et le terme rare ??t?? aux vers 1057-1061 dans un contexte de chiffres (vers 1051). On peut aussi citer un ?presqu'acrostiche?, *s??pa??? (vers 340-347) au lieu de s??p????? attendu."?Unfortunately, on closer inspection it appears that the instances found by Cusset (except ?pa?e, for which see my interpretation below) cannot be classified as non-fortuitous. A few years ago, Joanna Rostropowicz (1998, 109-11) discerned two more acros- tics: T?? (lines 223-5) and ??? (lines 343-5), which, however, in view of their shortness and lack of contextual confirmation, cannot be considered intentional. I am not convinced, either, by the author's suggestion that ???? in lines 772-5 and 929-31 replaces pappa and refers to Zeus, not even in the first passage, which is preceded by a line beginning with the name of the god. 3) Cf. Vogt 1967, 84-7, and Damschen 2004, 104-6; for broader context see especially Levitan 1979, 57-8; 64-6, and Haslam 1992, 199-202. A short summary of the discussion on acrostics in Aratus can be found in the Internet article by Hunter (1995); add Hutchinson 1988, 215 n. 4. 4) Acrostics are a verbal effect that is available most readily to readers, hence inscriptions encouraged such experiments; the trick was later taken up by bookish Hellenistic writers.

The implications of Haslam's observation for future studies are impor- tant as it makes us expect to find acrostics of different types in Aratus, deeply rooted in their immediate context. In what follows I would like to go further in this direction, and quote more examples to show Aratus' zeal to play with the acros- tic form as an esoteric literary device. The problem, as Haslam righdy remarks, is one of determining where to draw the line, and how. Therefore, let us start from establishing some criteria with which to select the material. As far as the extent of an acrostic is concerned, I am inclined to adopt, mutatis mutandis, the principle formulated by M. Hendry7) with reference to acronyms: "In decid- ing whether the pattern is fortuitous, the length of the [acrostic] is important. Continuation of the message beyond four letters would prove that it was intended, though it might be disputed just how many more letters would be needed for proof. The converse is not true: the pattern may be intentional, even if it only covers one four- letter word and nothing significant follows. In that case, only addi- tional evidence [. . .] would tell us for certain." This statement, however, requires an important reservation: there may occur situations in which even a long sequence of letters or 6) Haslam 1992, 201. 7) See Hendry 1994, 7-8 (available also through the Internet: htpp://www.cur- culio.org/mars.html).</page><page sequence="4">324 J. DANIELEWICZ syllables, in itself forming a meaningful connection, cannot be deemed a deliberately introduced acrostic. A striking example comes from Virgil,8) the poet whose Aratean sympathies are commonly recog- nised:9) in Eel. 4.47-52 the initial letters spell out CACATA. To take this as a non-fortuitous acrostic, a kind of scatological mar- ginal comment, would result in admitting hypocrisy, even blasphemy, on the part of the Roman poet, not to mention the internal incon- sistency of tone in the poem beginning with the appeal paulo malora canamus. As to the other criteria, I do not attach a lot of weight to the demand that an acrostic should encompass exacdy a given sentence or sentences. After all, Nicander's most famous signature10) does not fulfil such a requirement. In most cases?except, naturally, where the author's name is encrypted?a much more important expecta- tion is the acrostic's reference to the embedding lines or to the idea developed in or underlying the poem as a whole. Thus, I do not hesitate to reckon among acrostics, e.g., the sequence contained in Virgil's Eel. 8.42-7:11) incipe Maenalios mecum, mea tibia, uersus. nunc scio quid sit Amor: nudis in cautibus ilium aut Tmaros aut Rhodope aut extremi Garamantes nec generis nostri puerum nec sanguinis edunt. incipe Maenalios mecum, mea tibia, uersus. saeuus Amor docuit natorum sanguine matrem . . . The Virgilian goatherd, Damon, betrayed by the beloved Nysa, who married his rival Mopsus, sings of his futile attempts to win her favour. He has learnt what the cruel Amor is: his love turned out to be inanis. The broader context strongly supports the intentional- ity of the acrostic. To return to Aratus: once it has been shown beyond doubt that the poet plays with words (introducing not only acrostics, but also various figures of sound, echoing words, even telesticha and isopsepka),12) 8) Detected by Hilberg (1899, 303). The scholar includes this acrostic in the category labelled "Zufallsakrosticha von sechs Buchstaben". 9) For a survey of studies on this topic, see Scarcia 1993, 973-4 with nn. 9-12. 10) Ther. 345-53, detected by Lobel 1928, 114 f. 11 ) As far as I know, this Virgilian acrostic has not been spotted yet. 12) See Lewis 1985; Kidd 1967; Cusset 1995 and 2002; Fakas 1999; Scarcia 1993.</page><page sequence="5">FURTHER HELLENISTIC ACROSTICS 325 we are fully allowed to expect further manifestations of that ten- dency. It is true that the poet does not make the task easy, but that is part of his policy as a writer. Scholars have rightly empha- sised a parallel between the role assigned by Aratus, the interpreter of the heavenly map, to an anonymous star-observer and a reader of the Phaenomena: just as the former 'discovers' on the celestial tableau patterns which had always been there, so the latter should decipher meaningful 'signs' hidden in the verbal texture of the poem.13) The elaborate acrostic I am going to start with14) can serve as a good illustration of the above statement. I should like, however, to precede its presentation with some remarks on the poet's attitude towards the objects of description in the Phaenomena. Aratus treats the constellations both as purely visual phenomena and as animated figures.15) The astronomical and mythical come alternatively to the fore, which, consequently, modifies the mode of presentation. When the mythical past is evoked, the figures naturally regain (at least partially) the status of living beings. What is interesting in these pas- sages is the possibility of the poet's looking at the terrestial back- ground of the action in a similar way, i.e., with the intention of animating it. I venture to say that this situation occurs in the account of the origin of the Hippocrene Spring. The clue to such an inter- pretation is provided by an acrostic. I quote the passage with its preceding context: ??d' d?e tet??p?? est?? ap' ??fa????? ?a? ????? ?ess??e? ???te??? pe??t???eta? ?e??? "?pp??. 215 ?e???? d? ?a? fas? ?a?' ?????? ???????? ?a??? ?d?? ??a?e?? e?a?d??? "?pp?? ??????, ?? ??? p? ?????? ????? ?ate?e??et? p??a??? a??'

In Cusset 2002, 191-2, the stress is put on the poet's effort to indicate the mere exis- tence of the acrostic by arranging the words in lines 218-20 'regressively' and giving the expression p???? p??t???? p?d?? a metrical sense. My interpretation of the whole passage is entirely new. 15) For a good account of this phenomenon see Hutchinson 1988, 217 ff.</page><page sequence="6">326 J.

'But it is no quadruped; at its navel edge the sacred Horse is halved in the middle as it goes round. This was the Horse, they say, that from the heights of Helicon produced the good water of fertilising Hippocrene. The summit of Helicon was not then flowing with streams, but the Horse struck it, and from that very spot a flood of water gushed out at the stroke of its forefoot; the shepherds were the first to call that draught the Horse's Spring. So the water wells out of the rock, and you can see it never far from the men of Thespiae: but the Horse revolves in the realm of Zeus and you may view it there.' (trans. D. Kidd) The poet's response to the famous miracle, referred to by other writers in an emotionally neutral way,16) is very sympathetic: the comment encoded into the acrostic is ?pa?e, with a clear allusion to the expression (???) ?t??e of the preceding line, which can be interpreted as an act of physical aggression (cf. the ambiguous p????? in line 220). Also, the reaction of the Helicon is described in terms permitting one, secondarily, to think of a personification.17) In a comparable scene in Callimachus (h. 1.29) the Earth's suffering is called ?d??e?, 'birth-pangs'.18) It is a well-known fact that the anthro- pomofhisation/animisation of nature, confined to the sphere of feelings and sensations, reached the stage of artful mannerism in Hellenistic poetry and served often as a means for 'pathetic fal- lacy'.19) For the above passage, however, I propose an interpreta- 16) See Kidd 1992, 262. 17) Contrast [?d?? / p?t??] ?p??e??eta? (which corresponds to ?ate?e??et? p??a?? in line 218) with such instances as E. Supp. 1119: ?ata?e???????? t* ???es? p??????; AL?. 1067-8: ?? d' ????t?? / p??a? ?ate????as??; Alciphr. 2.18.3: e?? d? d????a t?? ?f?a???? ?p??e???. As to the relation between ?t??e and ?pa?e, it could be interesting to divine therein an echo of the Stoic opposition: t? p?????? t? p?s???, but this certainly would lead us too far. 18) The sense of the word is weakened, though, by the adjective ??af?a? (oxy- moron); nevertheless, the whole expression points to an anthropomorphic treat- ment of the Earth. 19) For a recent discussion of the problem see Bartol 1998, 77-84, esp. 81-2. Hunter (1995) speaks of "the 'pathetic fallacy' of Night's weeping" in Aratus* Phaenomena, defining it as "a fallacy enacted in language which describes heavenly phenomena in terms applicable to the struggling sailors themselves (kymainonti n?phei pepiesm?non 416, thliheV 417); here nature moulds herself to man's plight". Cf. Hunter 2002, 315: "i fenomeni della natura 'sentono' in sympatheia con la sofferenza umana".</page><page sequence="7">FURTHER HELLENISTIC ACROSTICS 327 tion according to which it is not nature that empathises with human suffering, but the other way round?the poet as a man feels empa- thy with the animated nature. In what follows, I give a selective list of further Aratean acros- tics, leaving out a handful of instances which are of no significance for or not supported by the context, and concentrating on those which seem to be most characteristic of Aratus. They are, gener- ally, syllabic and can be classified as 'gamma-type' acrostics. Their non-fortuitousness is guaranteed either by the content of the accom- panying text or by an evident word-play. The majority of them are self-explanatory, therefore I am sparing in commentary: ?????p???, ?? d??e? ?p??????? p???? ? e?, ???et? d* a????p?? ?ate?a?t??, ??d? p?t' a?d??? (101-2) In the above example the acrostic ANHP is corroborated not only by a?d???, but also by the synonymous ?????p??? / a????p??. ?pp?? d* ?d??????? ??s?? pe??te????????? p?ss? te ?a? ?efa?? a?e??sseta?, ??t?a d* "?pp?? (693-4) The acrostic ????S (echoed at the end of the second line) high- lights the short image of the Horse coursing up the sky. In the pas- sage discussed earlier (the one encompassed by the acrostic ???T?, lines 220-4), the Horse revolves in the realm of Zeus, as a result of which 'you may view it there'. This statement is confirmed by further passages: 281-3, where the Horse is prancing among Fishes, and 627, where it sets, but it is only here that we see it again in all its glory, with feet and head clearly visible. The holodactylic rhythm of 693-4 enhances the impression of movement, and the Horse's feet fulfilling their 'normal' function can be opposed to the function of its forefoot during the act of creating the spring Hippocrene. In lines 257 ff. the situation is more complicated. The passage, concerning the Pleiades, reads: ?pt?p???? d? ta? ?e ?et' a????p??? ?d???ta?, e? ??a? pe? ???sa? ?p???a? ?f?a????s??. ?? ??? p?? ?p????e? ?pe???? ?? ???? ast??, e? ?? ?a? ?e?e??e? ??????e?, ???a ???' a?t?? e??eta?. ept? d? ?e??a? ?p????d?? ?a????ta?</page><page sequence="8">328 J. DANIELEWICZ '??????? ?e??p? te ?e?a??? t' ????t?? te ?a? Ste??p? ?a? ?????t? ?a? p?t??a ?a?a. As Richard Hunter has convincingly demonstrated,20) Aratus in his description of the constellation acknowledges that there is a difference between myth and the evidence of our eyes. He explicitiy denies the truth of the story of the loss of the seventh Pleiad, using the form of an authorial comment on the subject-matter of his poem. The acrostic in lines 258-60 (shaped as an inverted gamma), I sug- gest, visually underlines the negation ("Six?"?"No!", twice repeated). The word-play in the next example is not confined to a 'gamma- acrostic' ?????? / ?????? (supported immediately by ???ta???); the poet additionally refines it by the combination of two proper names which phonically prefigure the third one: ???t? ?da???(?) ?? ???ta???: ???t? ?? e??de?, d?e?? s?ed?? ?da????, ??t?? ???at??e?t? ?a? et?ef?? e?? ???a?t??, ???ta??? ?????te? ?te ?????? ??e?d??t?. (33-5) The acrostic in the couple of lines quoted below: ????S? / ????S is accompanied by a play on word particles (note the inversion: ????-e?/?? ?????): ????s? ??? ?e????a? ?te????a?t? ????e?, e? ????? ?pp?te ?????? ?pe????e??? t?????s??, (1104-5) To the above series I add some more instances, which need not be fortuitous, given Aratus' interest in word-plays: ?a? t?? ??? ????s???a? ?p????s?? ?a????s?, t?? d' ?t???? ??????. ????? ?e ??? ??d?e?

(Epigr. 27 Pf. = AP 9.507.3-4)?and indeed we do not become disenchanted with the Alexandrian poet. On closer inspec- tion, some interesting examples can be detected in his Hymns. Let us recall first (ab love principium) lines 60-2 of the hymn to Zeus: d??a??? d' ?? p??pa? ?????e? ?sa? a??d??? f??t? p???? ?????d?s? d??t???a d??ata ?e??a?* t?? d? ?' ?p' ?????p? te ?a?

Disputing Homer's version, according to which Zeus was the elder brother and was apportioned heaven by lot, Callimachus follows in oudine Hesiod, who made Zeus the youngest, gaining power by the gods' universal consent, probably in order to point up the parallel with Ptolemy Philadelphus, youngest of Soter's five sons.22) The syllabic acrostic F???S ('common talk'), supported horizontally by the verb f??t? in line 61 (note the 21) p??t?? ???e??? ?a?p?? ?e?????? ??????t??. t?? d' ??a da?????? p???????deta? ?? ???a p????

A couple of interesting examples of acrostics can be found also in Apollonius Rhodius; I give a sample from each book of the poem. In Book One, in the course of the presentation of the heroes who came to take part in the voyage of the Argo, the poet devotes a passage to Euphemus, the fastest runner of the world, whom Europa bore to Poseidon (lines 179-84): ?a??a??? a?t' ?p? t??s? ??p?? ??f???? ??a?e, t?? ?a ??se?d???? p?d????stat?? ????? ????p? ??t???? ?e?as?e???? t??e ?????* ?e???? ???? ?a? p??t?? ?p? ??a????? ??es?e? ??d?at??, ??d? ????? ??pte? p?da?, ???* ?s?? ?????? ???es? te????e??? d?e?? pef???t? ?e?e???? The lines telling about Euphemus' birth and his wondrous abil- ities are encompassed by the acrostic TEKOI, as if Apollonius wanted 23) For the problem of overturning the accepted notions of progression and generational succession (with regard to the fusion of Zeus and Ptolemy Philadelphus in Callimachus' Hymn to ?eus) see also Hunter &amp; Fuhrer 2002, 169 f. 24) The instances under discussion show that Callimachus does not restrict him- self to gamma-type acrostics. Aratus* constant use of that very form is apparendy untypical. Also Apollonius Rhodius seems to prefer simple acrostics (I have traced only one possible exception at Argonautica 2.525-7: G???? / G??).</page><page sequence="11">FURTHER HELLENISTIC ACROSTICS 331 to comment on Europa's giving birth to an unusual son by adding a spontaneous wish in the optative ('May she bear. . .' [more such heroes]). The verb used in the acrostic refers clearly to t??e in line 181, which proves the intentionality of the acrostic. In Book Two (lines 421-4) the decisive role of deities in Jason's venture is strongly highlighted by the acrostic T??, which matches ?e?? in the line incorporating the last letter of the acrostic and, additionally, is supported by da???? on a level with its first letter. ???se?? ?pe! da???? ?te??? p???? ??e???e?se? e? ????, ?et? d* ??a? ???? p??p?e? ?s??ta?, ???a f???? f???es?e ?e?? d???essa? ?????? ??p??d??, ?? ??? t? ???t? pe??ata ?e?ta? ??????? The passage, constituting the final part of Phineus' prophecy, con- tains an answer to Jason's question about how to find the way home from Colchian Aea, which lies 'at the end of the world'. Phineus? once endowed with prophetic powers by Phoebus, but then pun- ished by Zeus for disclosing his sacred designs25)?acts now with due caution and, rather enigmatically, mentions 'the Divine Power'.26) Although subsequently he names Aphrodite as potential helper, it is clear that the wily goddess of love assures completion of one of Jason's problems, i.e. taking the Golden Fleece in Colchis, whereas the more general message conveyed by the acrostic covers all the cases of divine assistance, including Hera's help described at 4.576 ff. In the scene of Jason's encounter with Medea in Book Three, when the hero's homage finally melted her heart, the poet cannot keep himself from commenting, by means of an acrostic, on his cold calculation (lines 1008-11):27) ?O? f?t?, ??da????* ? d' ?????d?? ?sse ?a???sa ?e?t??e?? ?e?d?se, ???? d? ?? ??d??? ????? a??? ?e????????? ?a? ???d?a?e? ???as?? ??t??, ??d' ??e? dtt? p?????e? ?p?? p??t?????sa?t?, 25) Cf. 2.178 ff. 26) According to the rule formulated at 2.390 f.: ???a t?? ?e p???? ??e?? ???t?s?a? / ?a?t?s??? ta ??asta d???e??? ??e??p??ta; 27) It must be born in mind that at 3.973-4 (??? d? ??? ??s???d?? at? ???pept???a? / ?e??????, ?a? t???? ?p?ssa???? f?t? ?????)

DANIELEWICZ The acrostic reads O???, 'you had profit', ?you have benefit from having done so', which excellendy fits the context. It can be under- stood as directed at Jason, whose techniques of persuasion?albeit the task was not demanding after Eros' intervention?proved more than effective. The example from Book Four is again a kind of authorial com- ment in the form of an angry, direct address to the character who is just spoken of (lines 1489-92): ??? ?a??? ?pe? ?? ??? ?fa???te??? ?' ?t?t??t?, ?????? F?????? ?????e???? ??fa???? ?????? t' a?d???? ??a?a???d??, ?? p?t? ????? e? ?????? ?p??asse ?e?? ?a?? ???a f????sa?, The passage describes the death of Canthus at the hands of Caphaurus, a grandson of Phoebus Lykoreios and Acacallis, and the apostrophe evidendy refers to the first component of the god's cult- tide. The similarity is superficial since the poet exploits only the bad connotations of the appellativum ?????, 'wolf. In the Libyan context, however, the acrostic may also refer to Ares' son Lycus, the king of Libya, who used to sacrifice strangers to his father.28) It is conceivable that the poet's comment transmitted by means of the acrostic is a learned allusion both to Caphaurus' descent and the cruel local habits. Examples like these show that the poet's emotional involve- ment can find expression not only in traditional devices (cf. the Homeric exclamation ???a ??p??? at 4.875, of Peleus), easily dis- cernible both while listening and reading, but also in what escapes aural perception, i.e. in acrostics. The mere possibility of the exis- tence of thus encoded messages (whatever information they may convey) in the Hellenistic poets is a strong argument for recognis- ing an increasing degree of literacy at that time. Only readers could notice and appreciate such purely visual phenomena as pattern- poems or acrostics. Poetry was more and more experienced through books and, consequendy, became a private act of communication, no longer a public one,29) although it may be true that part of lit- erature was still written in the first place for performance of one 28) Cf. Juba, FGrH 3 F 23. 29) See Bing 1988, 15-8; Fakas 2001, 76.</page><page sequence="13">FURTHER HELLENISTIC ACROSTICS 333 sort or another.30) The transition of poems from performance event to the objects of accurate reading has been apdy termed 'textual- ization' by Andrew Ford.31) I think this term, originally used with reference to song poetry of the fourth century BC, also describes well the situation in the next century. Although the extent to which acrostics are characteristic of Alexandrian poetry still remains a controversial issue, any new evi- dence of their use inevitably puts a slighdy different perspective. To Alan Cameron,32) who contends that there are only two acrostics in Aratus and sees "no trace [of them] in such poets as Apollonius, Callimachus [. . .]", playing down the role of the device we are dealing with here seems much more natural than for the present author after browsing anew through the texts of the three poets, especially Aratus. To conclude: It is hoped that the present review of the hitherto overlooked acrostics in Hellenistic poetry, even if accepted scepti- cally, will stimulate further studies of the topic and contribute to their fuller appreciation.33) I can repeat after Aratus and my predecessors in the field: Not all secrets have been disclosed yet, ?t? p???? ?????pta?, and it is definitely worth the effort to follow the path.
