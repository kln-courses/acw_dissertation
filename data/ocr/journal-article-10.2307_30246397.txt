RUSCAVAGE-BARZ Environmental Section New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department 1120 Cerrillos Road, Post Office Box 1149 Santa Fe, NM 87504-1149 ABSTRACT Thirteenth century ancestral Pueblo communities in the northern Rio Grande were characterized by clusters of single-roomblock residences in an "unplanned" arrangement across the landscape. Toward the end of the century a new architec- tural form, the plaza pueblo, appeared in some of these clustered communities. Changes in design diversity for Santa Fe Black-on-white ceramics between single- roomblock and plaza pueblo sites are used to assess whether and how ceramic designs were manipulated to express identity in the context of changing settle- ment structure. In addition to stylistic data, petrographic data are considered as indicators of local vs. nonlocal ceramic production because production sources represent potential sources of design variation. RESUMEN Las comunidades arqueol6gicas de los Pueblos ancestrales (Anasazi) de la regidn del Rio Grande septentrional que pertenecen al siglo trece son caracterizadas por agrupaciones de residencias de forma cuadrada y singular, las cuales son distribuidas en el campo segln un patr6n no planeado. Durante los arios tiltimos del siglo trece, una nueva forma arquitect6nica, el "plaza pueblo," surge dentro de unas de las comunidades agrupadas. Los cambios en la diversidad de los disetios de cerdmicas del tipo Negro-sobre-blanco de Santa Fe recolectadas de los tipos de sitios son comparados; estos datos son utilizados para entender si los disefios cerdmicos son manipulados para expresar identidad social dentro del contexto de los cambios de los patrones de asentamiento. Ademds de datos estilisticos, datos de investigaciones petrogrdficas son evaluados en te'rminos de su utilidad para indicar producci6n local y no local de cerdmica, dado que las localidades de producci6n representan lugares potenciales de variedad de disehos. During the late 13th century, ancestral Pueblo groups in the northern Rio Grande region began moving from relatively small dispersed residence units into larger plaza pueblo villages. By the middle of the 14th century, communities composed of dispersed residences were replaced by multi-roomblock, multi-plaza communities, a settlement pattern that has persisted to the present day. Such fundamental changes in community organization undoubtedly impacted social relationships in ways that have yet to be delineated. In this paper, I consider how people might have used material culture to adapt to these changing social conditions in the 13th century by</page><page sequence="2">250 RUSCAVAGE-BARZ examining stylistic variability in Santa Fe Black-on-white ceramics between single- roomblock and plaza pueblos. Santa Fe Black-on-white is the most prevalent deco- rated ceramic type on Coalition period (A.D. 1150-1325) habitation sites (Wendorf and Reed 1955). Despite a small sample size, I can still assess the degree of stylistic variation between the two habitation types to determine whether an increase in the number of people in settlements prompted people to differentiate themselves from the surrounding smaller settlements. This study uses data from Bandelier National Monument on the southern Pajarito Plateau, New Mexico (Figure 1). The ceramic study consists of two parts: design diversity analysis and petrographic analysis of Santa Fe Black-on-white. Comparison of design diversity values for ceramics from single-roomblock and plaza pueblos enables me to assess whether the number of design elements changes between the two settlement types. Petrographic analysis of a sample of the ceramics used in the design analysis is necessary to determine whether Santa Fe Black-on-white is locally produced. In order to use Santa Fe Black-on-white ceramics to address questions related to local social processes, I had to determine that the ceramics were produced in the study area and were thus a reflection of local phenomena. The use of style to study interaction is not new (Crown 1994; Hantman and Plog 1982; Hegmon 1995; Stone 1992; Zedefio 1994). Potential correlates of social interaction and the expression of a common identity are illuminated by examining patterned variation in material culture style. Previous studies of design style varia- tion have examined how style is manipulated to convey such information (Macdonald 1990; Sackett 1990; Weissner 1983; Wobst 1977), as well as defining situations in which style is likely to be actively employed (Hegmon 1994; Hodder 1979; van den Berghe 1981). A productive approach to the interpretation of style considers how, why, and in what contexts people manipulate style to achieve certain goals. Stylistic manipula- tion is most likely to occur in situations of social uncertainty between groups (or communities) when identities are either unclear or called into question (Hodder 1979). Social uncertainty may have been a common occurrence during the thir- teenth century on the Pajarito Plateau, as people frequently relocated themselves on the landscape and communities were continually redefined (Ruscavage-Barz 1999). Theories of stylistic expression form the basis for the idea that style can be manipulated to denote social distinctions between individuals or groups. From these theories, the design production process is considered along with the situa- tions prompting active expression of group identity through style. THEORIES OF STYLISTIC EXPRESSION To understand how ceramic design style can inform us about social processes, it is necessary to consider how ceramic style might be used as a medium of communi- cation. Style is defined as a way of doing something in the context of a given set of</page><page sequence="3">Santa Fe Black-on-white Style and Technology 251 S\ .

The Rio Grande Valley and the Pajarito Plateau.</page><page sequence="4">252 RUSCAVAGE-BARZ alternatives (Hegmon 1992). A style cannot exist in isolation from other styles (Hodder 1990); indeed it is defined by how it contrasts with other styles. Style can have many meanings and the meaning of a particular style depends on the context in which it is used (Macdonald 1990; Weissner 1983). The proposition that ceramic design style would have been manipulated by the ancestral Puebloans of the Pajarito Plateau is based on a body of literature that discusses the role of material culture style in society. According to Whallon's (1968) social interaction theory, stylistic change is passive and is the product of learned behavior. This theory contrasts with Wobst's (1977) information exchange theory, which characterizes style as an active medium for communication of messages regarding group identity. These initial propositions prompted a series of debates between Sackett (1977, 1985) and Weissner (1983, 1985) regarding the nature of style. Sackett (1990) argued that style resulted from the passive processes of learning and acculturation; however, he conceded that stylistic distinctions may signify ethnic or social groups, but that this distinction is a latent function of style which occurs after the object has been made, rather than representing a conscious choice by the maker. Weissner (1983), on the other hand, subscribed to Wobst's view of style as an active medium of communication and expanded this view to include different contexts for stylistic expression and the types of information communi- cated in different contexts. The result was a definition of two types of style: asser- tive and emblemic. Assertive style has no specific referent or target, but represents individual assertion of identity. Emblemic style has a specific referent and target audience, and represents group identification. Thus, style can operate on both the individual and group levels simultaneously. Using Style to Express Identity Weissner and Sackett's approaches to style are complementary rather than con- trastive. Style can be both passive and active, and a single style can be expressed passively or actively in different situations. Style also is expressed differently at different levels of society, beginning with the individual and extending to the entire group (Macdonald 1990). Stylistic expression at the group (or household) level is of interest for the current study because I am trying to determine whether occupants of plaza pueblos manipulated ceramic style differently than occupants of single- roomblock pueblos. Turner's (1988:58-59) sociological model of interaction is useful for under- standing the ways in which social interaction can serve to promote a common group identity. Turner proposes that needs for a sense of trust and group inclusion serve as the underlying motivations for most interactions. People use gestures or objects in various ways to signal to others their role in the interaction. Repeated use of certain gestures or objects serves to structure social interactions so that they become predictable, thus fulfilling the needs for trust and group inclusion. Repetitive</page><page sequence="5">Santa Fe Black-on-white Style and Technology 253 use of particular ceramic designs is one means of facilitating this process as community members attempt to characterize themselves and others for the purpose of social interaction (Barth 1969), particularly in a situation where there is ambi- guity or uncertainty. For ancestral Pueblo communities, social relations between individuals and among communities would have been characterized by periods of ambiguity and uncertainty due to the constant movement and reorganization of people on the landscape (Levine and Anschuetz 1998; Naranjo 1995). This resi- dential instability of Pueblo households necessitated some sort of social mechanism for the dual purposes of facilitating interaction and redefining group membership. Ceramic style may serve as a mechanism for the active portrayal of group identity through the manipulation of vessel designs. Tilley (1991) makes the important observation that meaning in material culture is "indirectly communicated" by the arrangement of decoration. Designs are not randomly combined, but rather are structured by a definite set of rules that can be considered a design grammar. Tilley's notion of this grammar implies some type of common acceptance and recognition among a group of artisans regarding appropriate forms of decoration. Use of this commonly accepted and recognized design grammar subsequently serves to identify a person as a member of a particular group. The Coalition Period Social Context The Early Coalition (A.D. 1150-1250) settlement system on the Pajarito Plateau is characterized by small hamlets of 10 to 30 rooms dispersed across the landscape (Preucel 1990:92; Stuart and Gauthier 1981). Site layouts are predominantly linear or L-shaped, with one or more kivas identified at most sites (Root 1992; Snow 1974; Van Zandt 1999; Zier 1982). The Late Coalition (A.D. 1250-1325) was a period of change on the Pajarito Plateau, and in the northern Rio Grande in general. During this time, U-shaped and plaza pueblos first appeared (Kohler 1990; Steen 1977; Van Zandt 1999). Plaza pueblos typically consist of four roomblocks arranged around a central plaza, with a total number of more than 60 rooms; such pueblos indicate a change from the Early Coalition linear and L-shaped layouts. U-shaped pueblos consist of roomblocks arranged around three sides of a plaza. In addition to the changes in habitation layouts, a significant increase in the number of habitation sites occurred (Carlson and Kohler 1990; Hill and Treirweiler 1986; Orcutt 1999; Stuart and Gauthier 1981), representing a major population increase and the earliest period of intensive occupation of the Pajarito Plateau. Population growth rates during the second half of the Late Coalition were high enough to suggest immigration as a contributing factor (Orcutt 1999:230). Coalition period communities on the Pajarito Plateau consisted of loose clusters of single-roomblock pueblos. The first plaza pueblos occurred in the study area during the Late Coalition period. Plaza pueblos are not only larger than most single-</page><page sequence="6">254 RUSCAVAGE-BARZ roomblock pueblos, they also represent a new spatial arrangement of households on the landscape. Part of larger communities, they are characterized by several single-roomblock pueblos covering a 6 to 9 sq km area, with average populations of 300-400 people (Ruscavage-Barz 1999:127-129). A greater potential for ambi- guity and uncertainty of social relations probably existed within these larger com- munities because of the increased number of people interacting on a daily basis. Plaza pueblos within these communities suggest an intentional focus inward, per- haps as a way of excluding other community members from day-to-day activities. Given the potential for social instability and the "mixture" of settlement types during the Late Coalition, the questions are whether and how these conditions might be reflected in ceramic designs by considering two scenarios. In the first scenario, subgroups (such as plaza pueblos) might have used ceramic designs to assert their identity and differentiate themselves from other subgroups. I would expect stylistic differences between plaza and single-roomblock pueblos and, per- haps, that discrete "microstyles" might be identifiable within plaza pueblos. In the second scenario, despite the co-existence of different settlement types, groups might have used ceramic designs to assert their continuity or inclusivity. This behavior may be reflected by similar ceramic design styles between plaza and single- roomblock pueblos. CERAMIC BACKGROUND AND ANALYTIC METHODS Santa Fe Black-on-white is characterized by carbon-paint designs on a blue-gray paste and can be slipped or unslipped. This ceramic type was produced throughout the northern Rio Grande region and was prevalent between A.D. 1175/1200 and 1350 (Habicht-Mauche 1993; Sundt 1987). Its geographic distribution ranges from the eastern foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the Rio Puerco of the East that lies to the west of San Ysidro, and from Tijeras Canyon north to the Chama Valley (Habicht-Mauche 1993; Mera 1935; Stubbs and Stallings 1953). Certain Santa Fe Black-on-white design elements have been shown to vary through time. Previous studies of the style indicate that rim decoration, rim shape, and presence of rim lines are the most temporally sensitive variables (DeBarros 1981; Ruscavage-Barz 1998). Some evidence also exists for the increasingly exclusive use of solid elements over time; however, this trend is not consistently observed in ceramic samples from Late Coalition sites on the Pajarito Plateau. For the last 60 years, Santa Fe Black-on-white has been characterized in the literature in terms of technology and style (Habicht-Mauche 1993; Mera 1935; Stubbs and Stallings 1953). Until recently, little was known about the production of Santa Fe Black-on-white other than that it was locally produced throughout the region (Habicht-Mauche 1993; Vint 1993). The identification of Santa Fe Black- on-white "pit kilns" in the Santa Fe area sheds light on manufacturing techniques, as well as lending support to the argument for local production. Two pit kilns</page><page sequence="7">Santa Fe Black-on-white Style and Technology 255 discovered during the Las Campanas Archaeological Project northwest of Santa Fe indicate that small-scale firing of Santa Fe Black-on-white occurred in areas 6 to 7 km from the nearest habitation sites (Post and Lakatos 1995). These kilns are shallow oval basins averaging 1.65 m long by 1.1 m wide, and 10.5 to 22 cm deep. The remains of Santa Fe Black-on-white bowls were found in the features along with high percentages of sherd spalls and spalled sherds, indicating exposure to extreme heat. At least seven vessels were identified in one of the kilns, suggesting small-scale vessel firing. Compositional Analysis Design element patterning between single-roomblock and plaza pueblos can be argued to reflect local social processes only if Santa Fe Black-on-white pottery was locally produced. If microstyles can be identified for various sites in the project area, then it becomes necessary to know whether this is a product of social dynamics within the study area or a reflection of processes outside it. Previous mineralogical and chemical studies of Santa Fe Black-on-white have been able to determine whether the pottery from a given area had a geologically local or nonlocal origin (Habicht-Mauche 1993; Vint 1993). To differentiate geologically local from nonlocal pottery, a two-stage mineral- ogical analysis was performed. First, Santa Fe Black-on-white sherds were exam- ined with a binocular microscope to look for temper differences within and between sites to identify temper groups. Second, sherds from each temper group were subjected to petrographic analysis. Petrography identifies compositional groups based on the mineralogy of nonplastic inclusions in pottery and allows the analyst to identify shape, relative proportions, and size of inclusions (Tite 1972). A polarizing micro- scope is used to identify minerals in the paste (Bishop et al. 1982:281). For this project, the purpose of petrographic analysis was not to identify specific geologic source areas for Santa Fe Black-on-white, but rather to differentiate geologically local from nonlocal pottery at each of the study sites. Petrographic analysis can also determine which samples may originate from the same source (Kempe and Harvey 1983). This information can be used to infer both the movement of pottery among settlements in the study area, as well as the potential number of production areas for Santa Fe Black-on-white. Diversity Measures for Stylistic Analysis The Shannon-Weaver diversity statistic for nominal or ordinal data is used to measure temper and design element diversity among site assemblages (Shannon and Weaver 1949). The H-statistic is calculated using the formula H = -[L (n/N)loge(n/N)], where n; is the number of cases in each category and N is the total number of cases for all categories. The diversity index varies between zero and the natural logarithm</page><page sequence="8">256 RUSCAVAGE-BARZ of the number of categories, so that a value close to zero reflects a less diverse assemblage while one approaching the maximum value indicates greater assem- blage diversity. The diversity index is influenced by the richness and evenness of the assemblage. In this application, richness refers to the number of design categories (for example, solids only, interlocked solids/hatching, etc.), and evenness refers to how evenly the cases (i.e., individual sherds) are distributed among these categories. The closer the evenness value is to 1.0, the more evenly distributed the cases are among the categories. The richer an assemblage is, the greater the diversity value. Therefore, a meaningful interpretation of the diversity index must consider both the richness and evenness components of an assemblage. The H-statistic has been successfully used to demonstrate differences in design element diversity for ceramics from the Kayenta and Mesa Verde regions of the northern Southwest (Hegmon 1995). The Sample Sites The Santa Fe Black-on-white sherds used for the stylistic and petrographic analyses are from excavated collections of habitation sites on the Pajarito Plateau. Seven sites were selected for analysis, of which five have absolute dates confirming their occupation in the Coalition period. The remaining two sites are dated based solely on ceramic types. LA 4659, LA 4716, LA 6462, LA 4997, LA 12121, and LA 12119 compose the sample of single-roomblock settlements. LA 4659, LA4716, and LA 6462 are outside but adjacent to Bandelier National Monument. Area 1 at LA 60372, a 65-room plaza pueblo known as Burnt Mesa Pueblo, provided the plaza pueblo sample. Thin sections also were analyzed from 12 sites within Bandelier for which no stylistic data are available. The sherds from these sites were too small for reliable stylistic data, although not too small for reliable temper identifications. The inclusion of these 12 sites, all of which are single-roomblock pueblos, allows me to consider potential differences in the use of raw materials among single-roomblock pueblos. For each of the sample sites described below, all Santa Fe Black-on-white bowl sherds 3 sq cm or larger with identifiable design elements are included in the stylistic analysis. The sample cannot be random because of the need to select sherds with identifiable design elements. The decision to use bowl sherds is based on two factors: 1) bowls and jars may be decorated differently and thus the use of a single vessel type controls for this sort of variability, and 2) Santa Fe Black-on-white more often occurs in bowl form. SANTA FE BLACK-ON-WHITE PETROGRAPHY The petrographic analysis included 193 Santa Fe Black-on-white sherds from 19 sites in and around Bandelier, and was undertaken to determine whether Santa Fe</page><page sequence="9">Santa Fe Black-on-white Style and Technology 257 Black-on-white ceramics on the Pajarito Plateau were produced locally rather than imported. Local production, in this context, refers to the Pajarito Plateau rather than specific habitations. The lack of studies of clay and temper resources on the Pajarito precludes more fine-grained source determinations. Table 1 lists the temper types for the Santa Fe Black-on-white sherds from each site. The ceramics are characterized by a great deal of variability in temper type, with 19 categories represented. This wide range of variability may be misleading, however, given our lack of knowledge regarding the range of variability within each raw material source (clay or temper). The range of temper variability would be narrower if some temper categories are combined. The temper variants local to the Pajarito Plateau include mixtures of fine sand and glassy pumice with occasional tuff. Variations in the pumice/sand ratio account for the majority of variability in the ceramics (Table 1), and no single temper type dominates the sample. Most of the ceramics fall into one of two broad categories: more sand than glassy pumice or more glassy pumice than sand. Temper categories 1, 2, 3, and 5 represent the first general category and are represented by 34.1 percent of the sherds (Figure 2). Temper categories 4, 6, 10, 11, and 17 make up the second general category with 27.8 percent of the sherds. Temper categories 8 and 9 contain equal proportions of sand and glassy pumice and account for 3.4 percent of the sherds. Glassy pumice is intentionally added as a tempering agent in those ceramics with 20 percent or more pumice in the clay body; pumice is a naturally occurring constituent in those pastes with higher percentages of sand and only sparse pumice (Hill 1998b-d). The remaining temper categories do not contain any glassy pumice, 4.5% 12.1% 034.1% More Sand than Pumice D More Pumice than Sand 2.8% Equal Sand and Pumice Sand 15.3% Sherd 3.4% Other Non-Local 27.8% Figure 2.

Petrographic results for the sherds from LA 6462 (adjacent to Bandelier) indicate all are characterized by 15 to 20 percent sand as part of the clay body (Table 1). The sand is not an added tempering agent but occurs naturally in the clay (Hill 1998a). The homogeneity of the samples suggests these ceramics are made from clays from the same local source, which most likely is the Culebra Lake formation located between White Rock and Cafiada Ancha (Hill 1996, 1998a; Lakatos 1995). Nonlocal materials are not present in any of the samples. The sherds from LA 4659 and LA 4716 (also both adjacent to Bandelier) exhibit greater variability in tempering materials than those from LA 6462. The majority of sherds at LA 4659 contain sparse amounts of fine sand and 15 percent glassy pumice (Table 1) (Hill 1998d). Two of the sherds contain 15 percent fine sand and sparse pumice; the remaining sherd exhibits equal proportions of fine sand and pumice. Nonlocal materials are not present in any of the samples. The majority of ceramics from within Bandelier National Monument contain varying amounts of sand and glassy pumice in their pastes (Table 1). A relatively wide range of temper variability characterizes these samples and is not present in the sherds from the three sites outside the Monument. Within the Bandelier sample, the majority of sherds (65%) are made from pastes in which sand and pumice are natural inclusions, with the remainder of the sample containing other (14%), sand with various tuffs (9%), nonlocal (5%), sand only (3%), and sherd (3%) inclusions. The petrographic study of Santa Fe Black-on-white ceramics from the area in and around Bandelier indicates the majority of the ceramics were made from local (i.e., Pajarito Plateau) materials and, therefore, are appropriate for stylistic analysis. The small percentage of Santa Fe Black-on-white with nonlocal temper suggests limited ceramic exchange with people off the Pajarito Plateau. But the high per- centage of ceramics with pastes with varying amounts of sand and pumice and the degree of variability in the proportions of these inclusions hint at a number of potential local production loci. Most of the temper categories crosscut individual habitations, suggesting that many potters used the same sources or that sources with these general characteristics are widely distributed. This wide distribution of various temper types suggests uncontrolled access to these resources for pottery production, although this cannot be confirmed in the absence of detailed charac- terization of source areas. Petrographic data indicate a heterogeneous mix of temper types for Santa Fe Black-on-white. This heterogeneity appears to be evenly distributed in time and space. The same types of inclusions in roughly the same proportions occur through time in most of the ceramic assemblage (Table 1), indicating a fairly consistent technological tradition. This consistency also is reflected in the spatial distribution of temper types. Differential use of tempers across space does not occur; rather, the ceramics from all habitations have similar proportions of the same temper types.</page><page sequence="12">260 RUSCAVAGE-BARZ The 10 sherds from LA 6462 are an exception to the heterogeneous temper mix because all of these sherds have the same temper. This homogeneity could reflect proximity or differential access to a particular temper source. Comparison of ceramics from single-roomblock habitations versus the plaza pueblo shows that there are no major differences in the types of tempering materials used. The plaza pueblo exhibits a greater diversity of temper types, but this is apparently due to the larger sample size from this site. Regression analysis shows a linear relationship exists between temper diversity (H) and sample size (r2 = 0.386, p = 0.003); however, the relation- ship is not very strong. SANTA FE BLACK-ON-WHITE DESIGN DIVERSITY Design element data can be used to measure diversity among Santa Fe Black-on- white ceramics from different sites. Diversity can also be examined within three of the sites from the Bandelier study area (LA 4997, LA 12119, and LA 60372) for which two occupations are identified. For this study, diversity values were calculated for overall design form for the ceramics from each site. The forms included in the diversity calculations are 1) lines only, 2) solid designs only, 3) hatched designs only, 4). lines and solid designs, 5) lines, solid designs, and hatched designs, 6) solid and hatched designs (separate), 7) solid and hatched designs (interlocked), 8) checkerboard, and 9) lines and hatched designs. These nine categories represent all of the possible design forms identified for the Santa Fe Black-on-white ceramics in the sample assemblages. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic designs occur on a single sherd from LA 6462, but these designs are rare on Santa Fe Black-on-white ceramics. In terms of design elements, triangles and steps are the most common geometric elements through time and space, respectively (Table 2). Curvilinear and rectilinear elements are rare. There are no differences in frequencies of trian- gular and stepped elements between single-roomblock and plaza pueblos. Table 3 shows that designs composed of solids only, and interlocking and sepa- rated solid and hatched elements are the most frequent design forms at most sites, and most design form categories appear to be equally represented at most sites. The H-statistic provides a quantitative representation of this observed pattern and indicates similarities in diversity of design forms among the Bandelier sites (Table 4). The narrow range of variation in diversity values for the Bandelier sites, with the exception of the later occupation at LA 4997, indicates the same design forms are present at most of the sites. The richness values (number of design form categories represented) also illustrate that most of the possible design forms occur at each of the sites. Regression of richness against sample size, however, suggests richness may be strongly affected by sample size (r2 = 0.381, p = 0.034).

SANTA FE BLACK-ON-WHITE FROM THE PAJARITO PLATEAU: A TRADITION OF STYLISTIC HOMOGENEITY Petrographic and stylistic data for Santa Fe Black-on-white ceramics from the southern Pajarito Plateau indicate that these ceramics are characterized by techno- logical heterogeneity while exhibiting stylistic homogeneity. The range in temper demonstrated by petrographic data suggests that Santa Fe Black-on-white had multiple production sources even within a small area such as the southern Pajarito Plateau; such variation is attributable to small-scale household production. The stylistic homogeneity and consistency characteristic of Santa Fe Black-on-white is interesting given the number of possible production sources and the demographic and settlement changes that occurred in the area during the Coalition period. An increase in stylistic diversity might be expected during the Late Coalition as larger groups of people, including recent immigrants, interacted on a daily basis. An increase in design diversity, however, did not occur among Late Coalition pueblos. Furthermore, there do not appear to be stylistic differences between single- roomblock and plaza pueblos in terms of both design forms and number of designs (diversity) represented. Hegmon (1995) obtained similar results from stylistic studies of ceramics from sites in the Mesa Verde and Black Mesa areas. Her examination of stylistic diversity within and between sites from three different communities in the Dolores area demonstrates that stylistic differentiation between Dolores communities did not occur (Hegmon 1995:222). Hegmon also examined stylistic diversity between three small, short-lived habitation sites and one larger, long-lived habitation site from Black Mesa to determine whether there are differences between small and large habitation sites. The results indicate that stylistic diversity is about equal at all four sites (Hegmon 1995:218-219). These results are consistent with those from the Bandelier study area, where the ceramics from Burnt Mesa Pueblo do not exhibit more or less stylistic diversity than those from single-roomblock habitations. The lack of stylistic differences between single-roomblock and plaza pueblo settlements suggests that ceramic design styles were not being used to differentiate plaza pueblos from other community settlements on the Pajarito Plateau. Whereas the orientation of roomblocks around a central plaza represents a reorganization of the typical Coalition period settlement layout, the uniformity of Santa Fe Black- on-white designs indicates fluid transmission of design information and suggests that the communities to which the sample sites belonged were locally inclusive rather than exclusive.</page><page sequence="16">264 RUSCAVAGE-BARZ The proposition that stylistic homogeneity in Santa Fe Black-on-white repre- sents open social systems is supported by previous studies of ceramic design patterns in the Southwest. These studies have interpreted similarity over very broad areas (much larger than the Pajarito Plateau) as indicative of unbounded interaction between groups (Braun and Plog 1982; Crown 1994; Hantman and Plog 1982; Hegmon 1995; Stone 1992; Zedefio 1994). The results of Crown's Salado Polychrome study are similar to those for the Santa Fe Black-on-white study in that she demonstrates a fairly homogeneous design style despite multiple production sources. She interprets the broad sharing of Salado design style as indicative of a shared ideology among the groups producing Salado Polychrome (Crown 1994:212). The overall stylistic homogeneity of Santa Fe Black-on-white on the Pajarito Plateau suggests that the use of ceramics as a medium of inclusion/exclusion may have occurred at a larger scale than that of the site or community. If we consider the northern Rio Grande in general during the late 1200s to early 1300s, there is a proliferation of white ware types (Habicht-Mauche 1993) including Wiyo, Galisteo, Pindi, and Rowe, in addition to the continuation of Santa Fe Black-on-white. These various white ware types were produced in areas previously dominated by Santa Fe Black-on-white, suggesting that these localized styles developed out of the Santa Fe technological and stylistic tradition. Habicht-Mauche attributes the proliferation of local white wares to the use of stylistic diversity by northern Rio Grande inhab- itants as a means of "structur[ing] social relations and promot[ing] the stability and predictability of interactions between competing ethnic groups in an increasingly complex social landscape" (Habicht-Mauche 1993:1). The contribution of the current study to the argument that ceramic designs may be used as social boundary markers is that this social boundary function occurs above the level of the community for ancestral Pueblo culture in the northern Rio Grande.
