<plain_text><page sequence="1">87 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW for thought. He is certainly correct in stressing that zoomorphic manifestations of deities are not a primitive trait preceding anthropomorphism but that the two may coexist. He also correctly emphasizes that Crete must have had a polytheistic religion. His stress on regeneration, fertility and death is valid, and I agree that the scenes on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus must have had a significance which is broader than mere funerary rites. Had his insights been constrained by a more disciplined approach to iconographical analysis, this would have been a very exciting book indeed! College Year in Athens, Athens NANNO MARINATOS IMAGES OF THE DEAD AND THE DIVINE J E A N-P I E R R E VE R N A N T: Figures, idoles, masques: conferences, essais et le?ons du College de France. Pp. 247. Paris: Julliard, 1990. Paper, frs. 100. This volume brings together, unaltered but for the addition of a short introduction by the author, the 'resumes de cours' which Jean-Pierre Vernant published year by year in the Annuaire du College de France during his tenure of the chair of 'comparative study of ancient religions' from 1975 to 1984. On assuming the chair, he had stated his intention of investigating in his lectures 'les problemes de la mise en image du divin', the diverse forms of plastic evocation of the divine (or the deceased) among which ' realistic' anthropomorphic representation was only one late-emerging if ultimately dominant type. And his courses did indeed all take at least their starting point from aspects of that theme. After an introduction, which vindicates the autonomy of the visual image against those who see it as a form of text, a long first section treats ' la figuration du mort'; it takes up the theme of an earlier article, on kolossoi and 'the psychological category of the double', and sets the development from the archaic, non-figurative grave- marker to the funerary kouros in a much broader context: the changing forms of memorisation' in the developing city, the similarities and contrasts of poetic and plastic commemoration, the appropriation by the city of the heroic ideal of' la belle mort', the relation of the grave-marker to other forms of symbolic substitution or doubling of the person. The kouros, it is finally stressed, does not yet 'portray' the dead youth; rather it still, in the archaic way, 'stands for' him, although it goes beyond the sema in evoking his beauty through its own. This is a rich and complex enquiry, bursting out in all directions; the reader is left to make his or her own synthesis. This reader found the invitation to distinguish different modes of ' representation' very enlightening (V. develops this theme in an essay in his Religions, histoires, raisons, 1979, and in another fine one added to the new edition of Mythe et pensee chez les Grecs, 1985), but was unhappy about some of the principles used to explain the changes between them. A large part of V.'s argument is based on the view that we have knowledge, from Homer, of a ' pre-polis' heroic society, the institutions of which we can watch being gradually replaced in the archaic period. But, if it is useful to speak at all of' the rise of the polis', we should doubtless associate it, as most now do, with that 'eighth-century renaissance', of which of course the poetry of Homer is the most spectacular expression. Two consequences follow: Homer can offer us no simple access to a world before the polis, since he is himself arguably the first polis-citizen who we can put a name to; and we certainly cannot use the rise of ? Oxford University Press 1992</page><page sequence="2">88 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW the polis to explain a change, such as the emergence of the kouros, that occurred at the start of the sixth century B.C. Another difficulty: is it right to take epic poetry as the starting-point in a history of techniques of 'memorisation' that will go on to include funerary stelai, epinician poetry and the rest? Is this not to ignore the crucial distinction that, unlike these other forms of commemoration, epic poetry before Choerilus of Samos was, to our knowledge, exclusively concerned with the distant, not the recent, dead? For a genre that is more likely to have treated near- contemporary history we must turn to elegy (cf. E. L. Bowie, JHS 106 [1986], 27-34). A second section treats the problems of representation raised by the Gorgon, whose terrifying frontal glare no viewer can escape: most of this material (pp. 86-124) had already appeared, more or less verbatim but for some adjustments of order, as the main part of the short book La Mort dans les yeux (1985), but pp. 125-35 add thoughts on mirrors not reproduced there and distinct from 'Au miroir de Meduse' (available in L'individu, la mort, I'amour, 1989: here are also re-printed several studies of' la belle mort' that arose from the earlier courses). Two final sections treat Artemis and, more briefly, Dionysus (a few introductory pages aside, this latter is identical with Mythe et Tragedie deux (1986), pp. 237-70). The two gods earn their place, formally, because of their association with a special form of representation, the mask; but for a statement of V.'s position on that point one will do better with Mythe et Tragedie deux, pp. 25-43 (expanded with regard to Artemis in L'individu etc., pp. 173-210), and the long study of Artemis is in fact an excellent essay in a quite different Vernantian genre, the attempt to track a unity within the diverse facets of a god's activities. The familiar idea that Artemis is a goddess of the wild, of untamed nature, is imprecise, V. suggests: her sphere of activity is rather the point where nature intersects with culture: 'il s'agit des confins, des zones limitrophes, des frontieres ou l'Autre se manifeste dans le contact qu'on entretient avec lui, sauvage et cultive se cotoyant, pour s'opposer certes, mais pour s'interpenetrer tout autant' (p. 142). This formula is of course transferable to metaphorical border zones, such as that between 'untamed' children and adults. Artemis' association with warfare may seem to pose difficulties for this as for any other unifying view of her: but V. ingeniously appeals to the danger that the culturally sanctioned procedures of war may be transgressed, in favour of mere berserk lussa: 'c'est cette sauvagerie, tapie a l'arriere-plan de la guerre, que la presence d'Artemis, au seuil de la bataille, tout a la fois rappelle et vise a ecarter.' (The attempt to associate Artemis with a particular type of desperate battle situation, however, is not wholly convincing: several of her interventions discussed under this head seem rather to relate to her cultic role as a phosphoros - cf. F. Graf, Nordionische Kulte [Rome, 1985], pp. 228ff.- and even her eventual identification with the moon.) This is a fascinating study, only scraps and resumes of which have to my knowledge been separately published. Figures, idoles et masques is perhaps designed for the general reader, since as I have pointed out (making good an omission by the publisher!) good chunks of it are available, sometimes verbatim and with footnotes added, elsewhere; but this is one of the sections that specialists must take very seriously. The fact that one can thus, without irony, speak of the ' general reader' of V.'s elegant but demanding writings - I am told that he is a best-seller in France - is one reflection of his remarkable achievement.
