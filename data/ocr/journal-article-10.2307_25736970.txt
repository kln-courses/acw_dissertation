ISSN 0749-0208. Insights into the reasons why the early settlers of the Fiji Islands occupied particular sites and not others can be gained through their paleoenvironmental reconstruction. Of particular importance are the configuration of the coast under conditions of higher sea level (1.5 m higher 3000 cal yr BP), nearshore sediment dynamics, and the occurrence of mangroves and sea-surface fringing reefs. Four areas where some of the earliest sites are known to have existed are examined in detail: Natunuku on the north coast of Viti Levu Island, Matanamuani on Naigani Island, Naitabale on Moturiki Island, and the Rove-Bourewa sites in southwest Viti Levu. At the time of its earliest settlement, Na tunuku is shown to have been located on a narrow promontory, Matanamuani on a tombolo, Naitabale on a broad coastal plain, and Rove-Bourewa on an offshore island (now part of the mainland). The principal criterion in site selection by the first people in Fiji appears to have been access to a broad fringing reef rather than either the presence of a reef passage, access to fresh water or lowland suitable for horticulture. Subsequent (pre-European settlement) changes to the environment of each area and its settlement pattern are shown to have been largely the result of climate and sea-level changes.

INTRODUCTION Most paleoshoreline reconstructions utilize only physical data; many depend on models that have been validated for supposedly comparable coasts elsewhere. Tropical coasts have not generally been the subject of formal study for as long as their extra-tropical counterparts, nor are there gen erally such long series of continually-monitored data for trop ical coasts as for those elsewhere. This situation has led to a general lack of understanding of tropical coastal evolution and the search for novel ways of understanding this. This paper considers how the location and the nature of pre-modern human settlements along tropical island coasts can be used to inform us about how the coastline at the time appeared and how it has evolved since. The examples used here all come from the South Pacific archipelago of Fiji where for several years the author has been engaged with various collaborators in locating and investigating the earliest-known human settlements. There is no unequivocal evidence that people colonized the Fiji Islands before about 3000 cal yr BP (1050 BC) although unpublished dates for the Bourewa site (discussed below) suggest it could date from 3170 cal yr BP (1220 BC). The first settlers are known informally as the Lapita people, named after the place in New Caledonia where their distinctively decorated pottery was recognized first (Sand et al., 2002). 04-0198 received and accepted in revision 16 April 2004. Lapita pottery is the only pottery in the history of Pacific Island peoples to have been decorated with intricate patterns, many anthropomorphic, made using a technique known as dentate stamping. Lapita dentate-stamped pottery has been found on several archipelagoes in the western tropical Pacific and was manufactured for only 400-600 years. It dates from around 3450 cal yr BP (1500 BC) in the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea (Kirch, 2001) to as early as 2850 cal yr BP (900 BC) in Tonga (Burley and Dickinson, 2001), its eastern limit. Dentate-stamped Lapita pottery dates from around 3000 cal yr BP to 2600 cal yr BP (1050-650 BC) in Fiji (Anderson and Clark, 1999; Kumar et al., 2003). Although they also practiced horticulture, the Lapita peo ple depended in large part on marine foods, particularly those which could be readily gathered from nearby fringing reefs. They lived as close as possible to these resources, commonly on the lee (landward) side of the beach ridge (berm), some times even building their dwellings on stilts out across la goons. These observations, together with the small time win dows provided by dentate-stamped pottery manufacture, combine to give a unique opportunity to take snapshots of tropical island paleoshorelines some three millennia ago. Understanding of Lapita-era paleogeography also provides a baseline against which subsequent coastal changes can be evaluated. This is especially valuable in the tropical Pacific where views about post-settlement environmental change are generally polarized between those who regard humans as the</page><page sequence="2">16 Nunn Figure 1.

DISTRIBUTION AND CHRONOLOGY OF LAPITA-ERA SETTLEMENT IN FIJI As in many western Pacific archipelagoes, Lapita settle ments in Fiji appear to have comprised both closed sites (caves and rockshelters), sometimes a few kilometers inland, and open-coast sites. It is unclear at this stage of research whether these sites were established or used concurrently or sequentially. Yet, for the purposes of this paper, the interest is solely in open-coast sites because it is these which have the clearest potential to tell us about the nature of Lapita-era coasts and their subsequent development. Figure 1 shows the distribution of all known Lapita sites in Fiji, Figure 2 shows the occupation ages of those which have been reliably dated. Within the latter category, all sites are open-coast except for those at Qaranipuga (Lakeba) and Yanuca which are both cave-rockshelter sites. Four open-coast sites?Natunuku on the north coast of Viti Levu Island, Matanamuani on Naigani Island, Naitabale on Moturiki Island, and Rove-Bourewa in southwest Viti Levu? are selected for detailed study in this paper. CONTROLS ON OPEN-COAST SETTLEMENT In order to understand the types of open coasts which ex isted at the time of initial Lapita occupation and the changes which took place subsequently, it is necessary to consider a number of regional and local factors likely to have asserted influence. The most important of these is sea-level change. As antic ipated by Rhodes FAIRBRIDGE when he was an airforce in telligence officer during the Second World War (Nunn, 1995), it is now clear on both theoretical and empirical grounds that throughout the tropical Pacific, there was a mid-Holocene highstand (Mitrovica and Peltier, 1991; Nunn, 1995). This varied in both magnitude and timing; recent work has shown that a relatively long-duration highstand in the central and eastern tropical Pacific convincingly explains the compara tively late colonization of islands in that region (Dickinson, 2001). In the Fiji Islands, a detailed comparison between the oretical and empirical approaches produced a congruence in volving a highstand of as much as 2.1 m approximately 4300 cal yr BP (2350 BC) (Nunn and Peltier, 2001). Figure 3 shows the course of Holocene sea-level change within the past 5000 years and the dates of Lapita occupation at the selected sites. It is clear that the Lapita peoples ar rived to occupy Fiji at a time when the sea level was falling from its Holocene maximum level, something which may have been part of a deliberate colonization strategy (Nunn, 1988, 1994; Dickinson, 2003). Late Holocene sea-level fall along low coasts would have involved their straightening, as embayments were filled, and their progradation as both ter rigenous and marine sediments became stranded on newly exposed sea floor. Storms would have played a major role in coastal evolution; infrequent large-magnitude storm events could have thrown up beach ridges which soon found them selves beyond the reach of erosion, even during comparably infrequent large-magnitude events (Nott and Hayne, 2001). Beach-ridge plains of this kind are common in Fiji and are generally accepted as having been associated with late Ho locene sea-level fall (Nunn, 1990; Shepherd, 1990) although they can form under stable sea-level conditions (Dickinson et al., 1994).

Note that the oldest dates for both Moturiki (Naitabale) and Ugaga were from charcoal that may have been from old wood and are not therefore dependable indicators of human arrival at those sites. Notwithstanding this caveat, at present, based on both 14C dates and ceramic decorative motif, the oldest-known site is that at Naitabale on Moturiki Island (Kumar et al, 2003) followed by the Matanamuani site on Naigani Island (Best, 1981).

The degree to which tropical island coasts straighten and prograde under conditions of falling sea level depend on a number of factors. These include the rate and nature (mono tonic or irregular) of sea-level fall, the supply of sediment to the coast and nearshore areas, and the form of the emerging sea floor, particularly whether or not it is conducive to sedi ment accumulation or sediment loss. Each of these factors is discussed briefly below. The rate of late Holocene sea-level fall in Fiji averaged about 0.9 mm a-1. While there is no clear evidence for minor oscillations of sea level, these are nonetheless likely to have occurred (Nunn, 1995), and may have influenced the forma tion and/or the abandonment of particular beach ridges. In a global sense there is no consensus on the role of storms in beach-ridge formation (Woodroffe, 2002) although in the hurricane-prone low-latitude Pacific, where the visible effects of storm surges on coastal morphology are manifest, it is most likely that individual beach ridges formed during particular storm events. It is envisaged that a storm surge drives coarse beach material inland, and piles it up in a ridge, which is then isolated from wave erosion by subsequent shoreline pro gradation. Most Fiji islands are able to sustain rivers of size in rough proportion to island area for at least part of the year. In the tropical Pacific, the Holocene Climatic Optimum (approxi mately 6000-3000 BP) is thought to have been wetter than the later Holocene (Nunn, 1999). It is plausible to suggest that terrigenous sediment supply on most Fiji Islands at the time of their first human occupation was sufficient to be ex tending their coastlines (irrespective of sea-level fall) but that this process may have progressively decelerated as the cli mate became less wet during the late Holocene (Figure 3). To a certain extent, the reduction in terrigenous sediment supply may have been offset by an increase in marine sedi ment supply during the late Holocene. It has been suggested for Fiji and elsewhere in the tropical Pacific (Hopley, 1987; Nunn, 1990) that coral reefs had been unable to 'keep up' with early Holocene sea-level rise and succeeded only in 'catching up' during the late Holocene, perhaps as a result of the contemporary sea-level fall (Nunn, 1994; Kan et al., 1995). Thus at the time of the Holocene sea-level maximum in Fiji, around 4300 BP, most coasts would not have been fringed by coral reefs at the ocean surface. Probably not until a few hundred years before Lapita peoples started to settle these islands did many fringing coral reefs finally reach the ocean surface. Although this event had profound ecological consequences, it was also important because it meant that marine sediment supply to island coasts increased abruptly. The situation is illustrated in Figure 3. The form of the sea floor that emerged during late Holocene sea-level fall around most Pacific Islands would have had the subaerially-lowered surface of the Last Interglacial coral reef as its foundations. Being at least sub-horizontal, this surface and that of the Holocene reef growing up from it would have favored sediment accumulation rather than loss. The time when coral reefs reached the ocean surface in Fiji also had profound consequences for coastal sediment dynamics be cause it meant that for the first time during the Holocene significant barriers to sediment loss from nearshore areas (including island shorelines) were established. It is plausible to suppose that lagoon depths rapidly decreased thereafter and that a variety of shallow-water ecosystems became es tablished. It is difficult to pinpoint the time of this event but it has been argued that people would not have settled tropical Pacific Island coasts until the time that they had become 'at tractive' in such ways (Nunn, 1988, 1994; Dickinson, 2003). When the Lapita colonizing groups arrived first in Fiji, there were probably far fewer fringing reefs than there are today. Lapita site selection, which so puzzles modern observ ers accustomed to practically every coast being reef-fringed, may simply have targeted those coasts where broad fringing reefs existed already. Mention must also be made of tectonics. The Fiji Islands straddle the complex boundary between the Indo-Australian and Pacific lithospheric plates and have a history of differ ential vertical movements (Hamburger and Everingham, 1986). Yet in Fiji most such movements appear not to have obtained over periods of time as short as the late Holocene to an extent sufficient to distort significantly the levels at which the original Lapita sites were established. In this, Fiji contrasts with parts of Vanuatu where Lapita occupation lay ers are sometimes far above their original levels (Pineda and Galipaud, 1998) and also with Samoa where the most plau sible explanation for the underwater Lapita site at Mulifanua is that it has subsided within the past 2800 years (Dickinson and Green, 1998). Case Studies Four case studies, each centered on a well-dated Lapita era settlement, are discussed below. Using paleogeographic maps, a sequence of coastal evolution within the past 4000 years is suggested for each site. Sequences are based on avail able data, and sites selected are based on the availability of data, many unpublished. The author has undertaken field work at Natunuku and Matanamuani (Naigani Island) and directed major recent research projects (with Sepeti MATAR ARABA of the Fiji Museum and Roselyn KUMAR of the Uni versity of the South Pacific) at Naitabale on Moturiki Island, and at Rove-Bourewa on Viti Levu Island. NATUNUKU, VITI LEVU ISLAND The Natunuku Lapita site on the north (leeward) coast of Viti Levu island was excavated first in 1967 following the discovery of a dentate sherd there a few years earlier (Palm er, 1965; Davidson et al, 1990). Today the site lies along the north-facing coast of a low, narrow, bedrock promontory, its form disguised by infrastructural developments, shoreline reclamation, and mangrove forests. Shoreline progradation and, more generally, nearshore sedimentation along the north coast of Viti Levu is likely to have been accelerated during the late Holocene owing to the area's subsidence at a rate of around 0.2 mm a-1 (Nunn and Peltier, 2001).

(E) Present day situation. locene sea-level maximum, sea level had begun falling in the Natunuku area and a few narrow and discontinuous fringing reefs had developed around the two promontories in the area (Figure 4A) Reef developed preferentially on the northern sides of these promontories, away from the freshwater plumes associated with the rivers discharging in the area. Compared to today, coastal lowland was very limited and mangrove forest present only at the heads of deep embay ments. By the time of the arrival of the Lapita people perhaps 2800 years BP, sea level had fallen around 0.85 m from its Holocene maximum and much of the previously-submerged coral reef had finally 'caught up' with the ocean surface (Fig ure 4B). This was manifested in an increase in reef area, probably close to its Holocene maximum in terms of biomass production. The area of coastal lowland had grown slightly, both a result of falling sea level and increased nearshore ter rigenous sedimentation. Mangrove area had also increased slightly and shifted seawards, both as a consequence of shore line progradation. The Lapita settlement was probably estab lished with a view to gaining optimal access to fringing reefs, perhaps even using stilt houses (Davidson et al., 1990), rath er than being located close to a freshwater resource or a large area of lowland suitable for horticulture. By the end of the Lapita occupation at this site, perhaps 2400 years BP (Figure 4C), sea level had fallen a total of 1.2 m from its Holocene maximum. Slight increases in the area of coral reef compared to 2800 years BP had been negated by the extension of coastal lowlands and an increase in man grove forest. Most of the coastal extension was due to fluvial sedimentation in nearshore areas, often across fringing reef which was later occupied by mangroves. Close to the Lapita settlement, the area of fringing reef had decreased slightly while adjacent coastal lowlands had grown significantly, which perhaps encouraged a greater use of horticulture by the area's inhabitants, which may in turn have been neces sary given declining levels of food able to be gathered from areas offshore. Subsequent occupation of the area by the descendants of the Lapita people and later migrant groups is inferred from the general pattern of settlement in Fiji. It is likely that most people continued to occupy coasts and utilize coastal and low land resources, moving away from a reliance on hunting and gathering (particularly from fringing reefs) towards horticul ture and offshore fishing. Increasingly arid conditions during the Little Climatic Optimum (approximately 1200-700 cal yr BP) throughout the tropical Pacific are likely to have com pelled the coastal dwellers of this area, as elsewhere, to come together in larger settlements where labor could be pooled to create water-conservatory food-production systems such as taro terraces. A 30 km2 area of taro terraces farther along the north coast of Viti Levu Island from Natunuku was de scribed by Kuhlken (1994). Following the 'AD 1300 Event', a period of comparatively rapid cooling and sea-level fall marking the transition be tween the Little Climatic Optimum and the Little Ice Age, many coastal settlements in Fiji (and elsewhere in the trop ical Pacific) were abandoned because of the comparatively abrupt loss of food resources?primarily a consequence of sea level and water-table fall (Nunn, 2000). This time and its aftermath were marked by conflict and societal breakdown, leading to the first significant occupation of the interior parts Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 42, 2005</page><page sequence="6">20 Nunn Figure 5.

Settlements were generally estab lished on mountain tops and later, as the food resource base was gradually restored and later still, as missionaries arrived and helped break down intertribal mistrust, shifted to the valley floors and back to the coasts. A major injection of terrigenous sediment to the coastal zone at the mouth of the Sigatoka River, on the south side of Viti Levu Island, is attributed to inland land-use changes fol lowing the initial migration of coastal people inland up the Sigatoka Valley about 600 years ago (Dickinson et al., 1998; de Biran, 2001). A similar situation is envisaged for the Ba River, the mouth of which lies about 8 km west of the Na tunuku peninsula. In Figure 4D, about 450 cal yr BP (AD 1500), well after the migration inland took place, the effects of the sediment injection are seen by the increase in man grove forest area along the eastern side of the Ba River es tuary and the associated burial of fringing reefs in this area. The low sea levels (some 0.2 m below present) of the Little Ice Age (600-150 cal yr BP) account for some of the observed shoreline extension but most of this is attributable to near shore build-up of terrigenous sediment. The arrival of European settlers in the hinterland of the area, particularly between AD 1860 and AD 1930, and the clearance of large areas for plantation agriculture saw a fur ther increase in fluvial sedimentation in the Ba estuary, manifested in the Natunuku area by the spread of mangroves and the development of Bulu Creek, one of the major distrib utaries of the modern Ba River (Figure 4E). Along parts of the shoreline unprotected by mangroves, shoreline erosion has occurred, probably largely in response to sea-level rise within the past 200 years or so (Mimura and Nunn, 1998). Erosion has affected the now largely-unoccupied site of the Natunuku Lapita settlement. As elsewhere along the coast of Viti Levu Island, much of the fringing reef in the Natunuku area has become degraded through smothering by terrige nous sediment and overuse by the increasing numbers of peo ple occupying the coastal zone. MATANAMUANI, NAIGANI ISLAND The archaeological importance of the Matanamuani (VL 21/ 5) site on Naigani Island has been documented in two reports (Best, 1981; Kay, 1984). For many years, it was regarded as the earliest-known settlement in Fiji (Anderson and Clark, 1999) but now it appears to have been established after the Naitabale site on nearby Moturiki Island and that at Bou rewa in southwest Viti Levu (see below). Around 4000 years ago, the island Naigani was probably similar in form to most smaller islands within tropical Pacific archipelagoes (Figure 5A). There was no reef at the ocean surface and the only coastal lowland comprised storm beach es accumulated at the heads of the deeper embayments. Else where the coast of the island was steeply cliffed, a highly unattractive environment for potential settlers, particularly those like the Lapita people who sought a lifestyle based on nearshore marine resources and lowland horticulture. By the time of the first Lapita occupation of Naigani, per haps 2950 years cal yr BP, reef had reached the ocean surface along the windward coast where the broadest shore platform had been cut during the preceding sea-level highstand (Fig ure 5B). As a result of both this reef development and wave refraction in the lee of the largest offshore island, a tombolo had formed. In the lee of the tombolo, mangrove forest oc cupied part of the shoreline. The embayment at this location Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 42, 2005</page><page sequence="7">Reconstructing Tropical Paleoshorelines 21 Figure 6. Eroding shoreline near Navitilevu Village, Naigani Island. would have provided shelter for ocean craft. With these fac tors in mind, it is perhaps understandable why Lapita set tlers?some of the first in the Fiji Islands?elected to estab lish the Matanamuani settlement at the southeast end of the tombolo. Elsewhere on Naigani, bayhead beaches had in creased in size as a result of the fall in sea level. By the time the Lapita occupants of Naigani can no longer be recognized as a distinct group, about 2400 years cal yr BP, the falling sea level had led to significant changes in the is land environment (Figure 5C). Reef had reached the surface around most coasts of the island, although it was not yet at its modern extent. The Matanamuani tombolo had widened, and beaches had developed in most bayheads. Mangroves had extended along coasts in the lee of the tombolo. For the next 1800 years or so, the people of Naigani, be they permanent or temporary residents, made their homes along its coasts. Given the comparatively large size of the windward reef flat, it is probable that most settlements were along windward shores although on an island so small (1.9 km2), access to windward reefs is not difficult from any part. The societal crisis of the AD 1300 Event (see previous sec tion) led to the abandonment of coastal settlements and the establishment of three mountaintop inland settlements at Delaisova, Savaiwai, and Wailevu (Figure 5D). These were fortified sites occupied continuously (according to the island's modern inhabitants) during the period of conflict which fol lowed the environmental crisis of the AD 1300 Event here, and throughout much of the tropical Pacific Islands region and elsewhere in the Pacific Basin (Nunn, 1999, 2000, 2004; Nunn and Britton, 2001). The low sea level of the Little Ice Age was associated with shoreline extension around Naigani. Shallowing of nearshore areas encouraged the spread of man groves, particularly in the lee of the Matanamuani tombolo. Since the end of the Little Ice Age about AD 1800, sea level has generally been rising and causing shoreline retreat, man ifested around all coasts of Naigani (Figure 5E; Figure 6). The restoration of reef ecological productivity and the pacifying influence of foreign missionaries led to the inland upland set tlements being abandoned, initially in favor of the Natokalau site on the windward coast of the island and later, owing to the lack of sufficient fresh water for the growing population, to the present day village at Navitilevu. NAITABALE, MOTURIKI ISLAND The Naitabale Lapita site was discovered in 2002 at the southern end of Moturiki Island. The decoration on many of the Lapita potsherds collected suggested that it was then the earliest-known settlement site in Fiji, predating the Matan amuani site on Naigani (above). Radiocarbon dates show the site could have been occupied first more than 3100 cal yr BP but was more likely established around 2950 cal yr BP (Ku mar et al., 2003; Nunn et al., 2003). Around 4000 years BP, as sea level had begun falling from its Holocene maximum level, the area of southern Moturiki was characterized by comparatively little lowland, especially along the coast, pockets of mangrove forest in embayments, and an almost total lack of fringing reef at the ocean surface (Figure 7A). The largest single area of coastal lowland along the windward (southeast-facing) coast of the island was cen trally located, well-watered, with comparatively easy access via the interior to other parts of the island. The situation in southern Moturiki changed markedly around 3000 years cal yr BP (Figure 7B) when sea level reached a level approximately 1.6 m below its Holocene max imum level and met 'catch-up' reefs all along this windward coast. It is likely that when the Lapita people arrived first in this area, perhaps 3000 years cal yr BP, a 1-km broad reef existed off the entire southeast-facing coast of Moturiki. Man grove had spread along the southwest-facing coast but had disappeared along much of the windward coast as it was straightened by sea-level fall. The Naitabale Lapita settle ment was positioned to allow optimal access to the fringing reef flat by its inhabitants. Located just in the lee of the con temporary berm on the banks of the Mataloaloa River, it also provided freshwater and shelter within what is likely to have been dense coastal forest similar to that existing in the area today. The presence of late-stage Lapita potsherds 50-80 m sea ward of the oldest beach ridge in the sequence at Naitabale suggests that the shoreline at this location had prograded by this amount by the time the Lapita occupation of the Naita bale site ended, perhaps 2400 years cal yr BP (Figure 7C). By this time also, it is inferred that continuing sea-level fall had extended shorelines elsewhere in southern Moturiki, par ticularly north and northeast of Naitabale. A corresponding seaward shift and expansion of the mangrove forest along the southwest coast had also occurred. Through the combined effects of sea-level fall during the AD 1300 Event (see above) and the increased sedimentation associated with land-use changes within the last 200 years, the present-day situation represents another change (Figure 7D). Although the effect of recent sea-level rise has to some degree offset the shoreline progradation associated with sea level fall 2600-2000 cal yr BP, the net post-2600 cal yr BP shoreline change has been extension rather than recession. Shorelines all around southern Moturiki have been extended within the past 2600 years or so, the greatest amount of pro gradation (around 380 m) having been in the area north of Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 42, 2005</page><page sequence="8">22 Nunn IN / reef , edge - Mataloaloa rNaitabale R'ver Lapita site fringing reef flat 500 m upland area (&gt; 10 m) lowland area (&lt; 10 m) mangrove settlements Figure 7.

Net shoreline extension of approximately 275 290 m has occurred in the Naitabale area since this time. Lateral extension of mangrove forests and the fringing reef flat have also occurred, the former perhaps influenced by the accumulation of sediments derived from rivers draining the large island Viti Levu, 20 km southwest of this area. ROVE-BOUREWA, VITI LEVU ISLAND Three Lapita sherds found along Rove Beach in the last three years alerted the author to an early human occupation of this area (Kumar et al., 2004). Excavations at Rove in De cember 2003 revealed a late Lapita site but a reconnaissance of the surrounding area led to the discovery of a major early Lapita site at nearby Bourewa (Figure 8). Around 4000 cal yr BP, as sea level has just begun falling from its Holocene maximum, the Rove-Bourewa area com prised the open Tuva Estuary with four bedrock islands at its mouth (Figure 9A). Likuri and Navo islands exist still but Rove and Vusama islands (names given in this paper) are now part of the Viti Levu mainland. At this time, a little mangrove existed along areas of recent sediment accumula tion in the nearshore zone. The reef crest here is assumed to have caught up with sea level first around 4000 cal yr BP and then to have extended landward through growth of the reef pavement. By the time of the earliest Lapita settlement perhaps 1220 BC at Bourewa (Figure 9B), much of the fringing reef which currently exists was growing at the surface. Rove and Vusa ma islands were still separated from the mainland at this time. The process of landward expansion of reef pavement is assumed to have been in progress at the time of initial Lapita settlement and may have influenced the precise choice of the Bourewa settlement site. The first Lapita settlement at Bou rewa was located centrally along the ocean-facing coast of Vusama Island, almost as close as possible to the resources of the entire 18 km2 reef fringing Vusama Island today. Ow ing to the dominant southeast tradewinds affecting this lo cation it is also possible that the southeast part of this fring ing reef was ecologically richer than other parts. By the end of the Lapita occupation of Vusama Island (Fig ure 9C), perhaps around 2500 cal yr BP (550 BC), it was still detached from the mainland but river channels were narrow ing as mangroves spread along their sides and filled coastal embayments. The development of mangrove forest between Vusama Island and smaller Rove Island may have influenced the choice of the latter for the location of a later Lapita set tlement in this area. The establishment of the Rove settle ment may also have been influenced by the landward exten sion of the reef flat in the 600 years or so since the first Lapita occupation of Vusama Island. The other Lapita site on Vusama Island, first reported by Palmer (1965) and as sumed by Clark and Anderson (2001) on the basis of the single potsherd recovered to be a late rather than an early site, was established at Waikereira. If environmental change (rather than, say, population overspill from nearby Bourewa) was a factor in the establishment of Waikereira, then it is likely that it was the landward growth of the fringing reef which encouraged settlement of what had earlier been a lo cation with less ready access to this reef. It is difficult to suppose that any other factor, such as access to fresh water or existence of a safe harbor for ocean-going watercraft, had much influence on the choice of the three Lapita sites on Vus ama Island. It is likely that settlements remained throughout the pe riod 2500 cal yr BP to 700 cal yr BP on Vusama Island but, following the environmental crisis associated with the AD 1300 Event (Nunn, 2000), they were abandoned as their in habitants sought inland refuges from the ensuing conflict (Figure 9D). The sea-level fall during the AD 1300 Event saw extensions of shorelines and mangrove forests, both also in fluenced by the increased sediment loads associated with land-use changes inland.

The original site, established perhaps 3170 cal yr BP (1220 BC), was located behind an arcuate beach ridge which has now been truncated along the present beach, exposing large numbers of dentate potsherds thereon. with which to test these inferences for the Rove-Bourewa area. The modern environment in this area is shown in Figure 9E. Vusama Island is now connected to the mainland by the barrier at the head of Natadola Harbour. This barrier is pe riodically breached in times of flood but rebuilds itself within a few weeks. Shorelines throughout the area have receded as a result of recent sea-level rise but this has been offset to some extent by increased fluvial sediment loads and the as sociated extension of mangrove forest. DISCUSSION One thing that appears clear from the paleogeographical analyses of the four Lapita settlement sites in Fiji is how they were situated as far as possible away from the mainland at Figure 9.

At Natunuku, the site is on a narrow promontory projecting out to sea, in the Rove-Bourewa area, the sites were on offshore islands. Naigani and Moturiki, where the two oldest-known Lapita settlements in Fiji, were once thought to be located, are both smaller offshore islands. The observation suggests that the Lapita people in Fiji were less concerned with access to fresh water and lowland suit able for horticulture than with optimal access to a broad fringing reef. Similar situations probably obtain with the locations of Lapita settlements elsewhere. A tombolo settlement, almost identical to the Matanamuani site on Naigani, was described from Faleloa in the Ha'apai Group of Tonga by Dickinson et al. (1994). Some of the Lapita sites in the Mussau Islands of Papua New Guinea, and the eastern outer Solomon Islands (Lepofsky, 1988) may also have been located on tombolos. It is pertinent to note that few archaeological reports on Lapita (and other) excavations give information which can be used to make convincing paleogeographical reconstructions. In Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, where malaria occurs today, it has sometimes been assumed that the pref erence of Lapita people for settling smaller offshore islands (and building stilt houses out across the water) was to min imize their exposure to malarial mosquitoes (Kirch, 1997). Yet, while this may have been an important factor, it is also important to ask why these traditions were continued in Fiji and Tonga to the east, where malaria probably never existed. Given the analysis in this paper, it seems that the selection of such locations were an expression of the overriding impor tance to Lapita settlers of proximity to a broad fringing reef, accessible by gleaners and rich in the types of marine foods they favored. It is possible that reef flats unusually rich in particular marine foods, perhaps the highest biomass species, were deliberately selected. This conclusion is quite different from that reached by Le pofsky (1988) in an analysis of the environmental factors influ encing the choice of Lapita settlement locations. Lepofsky found that access by watercraft and proximity to fresh water and lowland suitable for horticulture were factors which ap parently took precedence over optimal access to a fringing reef. Without necessarily rejecting Lepofsky's analysis, which analyzed sites throughout the Lapita region, it appears questionable because it assumes that Lapita coastal environ ments were the same as those of today. Clearly, as shown in the present paper, the locations of many Lapita sites today are quite different with respect to access to various resources. On many of the sites analyzed by Lepofsky, it is probable that what was a broad fringing reef adjoining the site at the time of Lapita occupation has now been killed and obscured by sedimentation and shoreline extension, a result of both human impact and late Holocene sea-level fall. CONCLUSIONS Many tropical coasts, particularly island coasts, have been disturbed very little since the times when they were first set tled and, as such, they provide excellent opportunities for studying long-term coastal evolution in a variety of situa tions. This paper has shown how convincing paleogeographic reconstructions can be made of key sites and how they evolved under the influence of both natural and human-in duced processes. The understanding of landscape develop ment in tropical regions continues to pose many challenges for those seeking to manage them effectively, particularly in the face of likely future climate and sea-level changes. In a more specific sense, paleogeographic reconstruction of Lapita-era settlement sites in Fiji suggests that access to a broad fringing reef was the most important criterion in site selection. This conclusion might suggest that, at least in Fiji, the earliest settlers were perhaps inclined more towards 'strandlooping' in the sense of Groube (1971) rather than searching out cultivatable lowlands which has become a more widely-accepted explanation (Green, 1979; Kirch, 1997). It remains to be seen whether this conclusion, based on just four paleogeographic reconstructions in one Pacific archipel ago, comes to apply elsewhere or not. The preference of early (Lapita-era) settlers in the tropical Pacific Islands for settling offshore islands, coastal promon tories and tombolos is becoming clear. At this stage of re search it appears that this preference reflects their wish to settle adjacent to a broad fringing reef, accessible to land based (rather than boat-based) fishers and gleaners. It may also be, as others have suggested (Kirch, 1997), that the choice of such sites reflects a desire to minimize exposure to malarial mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects.
