While the anthro- pologist can only be sympathetic to such an undertaking, Professor Blassingame may have overreacted to this tendency in his dis- cipline. Without making the political situa- tion the dominant thrust of his study, a chapter-length discussion of the topic would have added to the integration and complete- ness of his presentation. The author makes clear that the seaport of New Orleans, with its rich history and varied population, is a unique setting for such a study. The white inhabitants included those of Anglo-Saxon, French, and Latin descent. The Negro community was com- posed of a substantial number of free Negroes dating back to the antebellum period and those recently freed from servi- tude. Many of the former were economically advantaged and sophisticated Creoles, while the latter were for the most part illiterate and economically unskilled Afro-Americans. It is therefore not surprising that Professor Blassingame ends his book with the observa- tion that New Orleans provided Jim Crow with his "strangest career in nineteenth century America" (p. 217). The book emerges as an unpretentious and informative volume that conveys the considerable accomplishments as well as frustrations of the city's black population. Relying predominantly on primary sources, veying what he had learned and understood. The gifts were those of the novelist, but the product was different because it focused on general social and biological forces as the constraints upon and resources for the individual destinies they thus explained. This book represents that golden age of ethnog- raphy; its author commands those tools. I commend it to you for both its flaws, which would distort this brief review to dwell on, and its accomplishments. 924 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [76,1974] Black New Orleans, 1860-1880. JOHN W.

Reviewed by STAN WILK Lycoming College Historian John Blassingame undertakes a description and analysis of Negro life in New Orleans during the Reconstruction Period. Following a brief discussion of the antebel- lum situation and the Civil War activities of Louisiana blacks, the author successively treats economic activities, family life, educa- tional endeavors, and social life of the city's Negro population. The final chapter on race relations is followed by a brief concluding statement. The study is designed to counter- balance the traditional treatment of the period in terms of a "narrowly conceived Two archaeological studies undertaken in the zone of the 1562 visita complete this volume. Ramiro Matos Mendieta presents a preliminary description, accompanied by useful photographs and plans of structures, of two rural hamlet sites. Although the ham- lets are within the area visited by Ortiz de Zufiiga, unfortunately they were not de- scribed in the visita. Matos' discussion would have been of greater utility had he selected sites specifically covered in the document. Craig Morris, on the other hand, relates his archaeological study directly to the ethno- historical material in the visita. IHis essay deals with the different types of storage facilities encountered in two hamlets men- tioned in the.visita and suggests correlations between some of these structures and sys- tems of storage of the Inca empire. The text of the visita, the related docu- ments and the essays by the scholars combine to provide a very valuable addition to the literature on Andean cultural history. The editor and contributors are to be com- mended for the exemplary presentation of a useful ethnohistorical document and the demonstration of how such a document may be subjected to fruitful scrutiny and inter- pretation in a variety of disciplines.

The consequence, of course, is to assume in advance the conclusion: that the social institutions are adaptations to the form of production. There was a time-between its recording customs and its pursuit of problems, lexi- cons, and things to be counted-when ethnography was concerned with people, with how the culturally mediated world im- pinged upon and was transformed by the perceptions, goals, feelings, and aspirations of recognizably human beings. Ethnography was then an heroic, humane, and very per- sonal enterprise-an art, not a craft. Its tools were the ethnographer's character and re- sponsiveness that made natives open and truthful, the empathy that permitted under- standing, the cultivation of mind that en- abled him to see implications for humanity, the alert sensitivity that captured isolated moments as illustrations of underlying pat- terns and historical processes, and his literary genius for synthesizing and con- the author weaves such diverse -threads as newspaper reportage, census material, diaries, and travel accounts into a coherent if uninspired tapestry of the Negro social scene. Thus he achieves his goal of providing "a standard by which scholars can compare Negro life in other Southern cities" (p. xvi). The chapter on race relations reveals the inconsistent segregation practices and sexual anxieties of the white populace. Professor Blassingame believes that it was the fear of black men marrying their daughters that "lay at the foundation of almost all white op- position to the Negroes' acquisition of civil and political rights" (p. 204). In evaluating the period, he emphasizes the Negroes' com- mitment to educating their children. While he sees some success in the economic realm during the period, more than in the political, he considers the development of increasingly stable Negro family life most noteworthy.

Reviewed by MICHAEL MOERMAN University of California, Los Angeles This book has two parts, and each part has four chapters. The first chapter describes the physical and demographic aspects of Bang Chan, once a village and now an in- dustrialized suburb in Central Thailand, and compares it with places more familiar to American undergraduates in such a way that life there retains its peculiar local character, but without exotic preciousness. The second and third chapters display an elegant com- mand of the history and biology of rice ex- pressed in properly (because of the use of native metaphor) anthropomorphic terms. They are a strong and lovely evocation of the vast and impersonal forces that make plants and soil. With no loss of the sense of complicated interrelationships, Hanks cuts through masses of detailed knowledge. The concluding chapter of this part both defines his critical ecological concept, "the holding," and provides pithy expression of the knowledge and perceptions of farmers. It also attempts, not too successfully I think, to formalize and quantify the energy ex- changes of various rice-farming holdings. The book's second half traces the history of Bang Chan as it changed from a settle- ment of pioneering "shifting cultivators" to broadcasters, transplanters, and finally occa- sional farmers. Its model of adaptation is quite interesting. The basic adaptive unit is the household. It preserves the integrity of its functions by using constant principles of recruitment (essentially of conscious reci- procity) so that changing circumstances oc- casion the inclusion of different personnel. Of more immediate relevance to ecology, al- tered types of agricultural production are viewed as the consequences of decisions about production made by households pur- suing their own integrity. This perhaps jus- tifies what would otherwise be solely a fault. Each historical period, "shifting cultiva- tion," "broadcasting," and "transplanting," is used merely as a title of a chapter, with little effort made to trace the relationships between a given form of farming and the social descriptions (e.g., of government,</page></plain_text>
