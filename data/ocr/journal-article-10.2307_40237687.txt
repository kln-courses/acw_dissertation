<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nietzsche's Clever Animal: Metaphor in "Truth and Falsity" Peter Heckman "A text," Derrida teils us, "is not a text unless it hides from the first corner, from the first glance, the law of its composition and the rules of its game."1 Thus Derrida identifies a hidden residue within each text, something thè text holds in reserve. This is not to sug- gest that an appropriately attentive reader can do what the naive reader cannot. The outline of this hidden reserve cannot be com- pletely traced. It cannot be brought within the compass of the text 's authority, cannot be inscribed within the text 's own dis- course; precisely because this reserve générâtes the text itself, it opens the field upon which the text may deploy its stratégies. Let us note that the preceding paragraph employs a language which is by no means innocent. Through the work of Derrida, issues such as the "text," its "discourse" and "hidden reserve," its "author- ity" and "inscription," and what is "appropriate" or "proper" to it have all become highly sedimented, burdened with thè weight of a vast discourse and spécifie strategy. But to point this out is only to make the point of the preceding paragraph all over again. For every text is struetured by a grid which may be called into question. Inter- rogated, that is, but not overcome or exhausted; something remains which is irreducibly elusive. The différence, then, between the naive and the attentive reader is that the latter retains this particular awareness in his or her encounter with the text. The hope, here, is that such a rétention will help us resist what de Man calls "the illusion that rhetorical blindness can be overcome."2 The trick is to remain aware of this hidden reserve even without being able to delineate fully its characteristics, that is, to note its influence within the text itself, especially the extent to which the manifest message of thè text is countered or subverted by this hidden reserve. In this essay I attempi such an attentive reading of one of Nietz- sche's unpublished essays, "On Truth and Falsity in an Ultra- Moral Sense,"3 (hereafter "Truth and Falsity"). "Truth and Fal- sity," of course, is one of Nietzsche's very early works. In this Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 24, No. 4, 1991. Copyright © 1991 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park PA. 301</page><page sequence="2">302 PETER HECKMAN essay, Nietzsche attempts to attain a style in which he can make some rather difficult points concerning, for instance, the status of knowledge and the reliability of language. Nietzsche's attempts to find the appropriate voice in which to make thèse points is less successful hère than in the more mature work, for instance, Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Indeed, anything more than a superficial read- ing of "Truth and Falsity," as we shall see, must acknowledge a certain degree of confusion embedded in the text. In thèse pages I will show how a certain kind of confusion can work in Nietzsche's fa vor; that is, I will show how his use of metaphor in "Truth and Falsity" helps to make the point of the essay. My reading of "Truth and Falsity" needs to be placed under the jurisdiction of two other texts which touch upon this particular text: thè treatment of Nietzsche in de Man's Allégories of Reading, and Derrida's essay, "White Mythology: Metaphor in the Text of Philosophy".4 In neither de Man nor Derrida is a treatment of "Truth and Falsity" a primary concern. Let us briefly sketch the concerns of de Man and Derrida in thèse texts. For de Man, the hidden reserve we hâve mentioned above will be described as the rhetorical structure of thè text. He seeks to show how the rhetorical strategy of a text conflicts with, and under- mines, the literal message of the text itself. Thus de Man asks himself whether or not an essay such as "Truth and Falsity" "es- capes from the kind of error it denounces."5 He quickly concludes that it does not: A text like "On Truth and Lie," although it présents itself legiti- mately as a démystification of literary rhetoric remains entirely liter- ary, rhetorical, and deceptive itself.6 De Man's use of "Truth and Falsity" is meant to provide évidence for his more generai point that philosophy, which continually as- serts its différences from literature, remains itself thoroughly grounded in rhetoric and is thus literary. "Philosophy," according to de Man, "turns out to be an endless reflection on its own destruc- tion at the hands of literature."7 De Man uses "Truth and Falsity" as part of his larger project of denying the différence between philosophical and literary texts. De Man's treatment of "Truth and Falsity" is very brief, as opposed to his more lengthy treatment of The Birth of Tragedy; and the charge that "Truth and Falsity" commits the error it de-</page><page sequence="3">NIETZCHE'S CLEVER ANIMAL 303 nounces remains, in my view, without adequate justification in de Man's text. His main point is that "Truth and Falsity" dénies the existence of a self-identical subject even as the authorial voice asserts itself as a subject: Making the language that dénies the self into a center rescues the self linguistically at the same time that it asserts its insignificance, its emptiness as a mere figure of speech. It can only persisi as self if it is displaced into the text that dénies it. . . . By calling the subject a text, the text calls itself, to some extent, a subject.8 Even granting de Man this point, one wonders if this alone can possibly tell thè whole story of how rhetorical strategy confronts the literal message of "Truth and Falsity." In what follows I hope not only to fili in this aporia in de Man, but also to show that the formula "the essay does rhetorically what it condemns literally" is a little too easy in this case. We will need a some what finer net in approaching an essay as complicated as "Truth and Falsity" and an author as elusive as Nietzsche. In the text by Derrida, the issue is not rhetoric as such but metaphor. Derrida wishes to show the irreducible impossibility of constructing either a generai taxonomy of philosophical meta- phors, or a philosophical account of metaphor itself. Philosophy, in brief , cannot appropriately account for metaphor because phi- losophy is always already textured by metaphor itself. Any account of metaphor by philosophy, then, would commit the error of using the term to be defined within the définition. Each time that a rhetoric defines metaphor, not only is a philosophy implied, but also a conceptual network in which philosophy itself has been constituted. Moreover each thread in this network forms a turn, or one might say a metaphor if that notion were not too derivative hère. What is defined, therefore, is implied in the defin- ing of the définition.9 Derrida describes this circularity as the "abyss of metaphor," an abyss from which philosophy will ne ver escape. The material that serves Derrida in this project is the metaphors offered by diverse thinkers in order to explain the process of meta- phorization itself. That is, he examines the metaphors descriptive of metaphor itself. The Nietzsche of "Truth and Falsity" arises in this context, but only as one example among many. The metaphor</page><page sequence="4">304 PETER HECKMAN for metaphor which appears to guide Derrida's analysis, however, is uncannily similar to one offered in "Truth and Falsity": Anatole France's explanation of metaphors as coins which hâve had their faces erased.10 What I borrow from Derrida, hère, is his more generai procedure of questioning the metaphors that structure philosophical discourse. The présent essay is an attempt to bring this strategy to bear on "Truth and Falsity." Let us turn, then, to Nietzsche's text. "Truth and Falsity" begins with what Nietzsche obliquely refers to as a fable: In some remote corner of thè universe, effused into innumerable solar-systems, there was once a star upon which clever animais in- vented cognition [Erkennen]. It was the haughtiest, most menda- cious moment in the history of this world, but yet only a moment. After Nature had taken breath awhile the star congealed [erstarrte] and the clever animais had to die.11 This "fable" encapsulâtes, in a highly Condensed manner, the en- tire essay that follows. In this, it is reminiscent of the prologue in some classical tragédies, where thè e vents of the upcoming drama are briefly summarized for the audience. This, in itself, is striking given that Nietzsche, in his earlier The Birth of Tragedy, has al- ready criticized the use of such a prologue as part of his more generai condemnation of Euripides.12 Just as remarkable is the forthright use of an omniscient authorial voice in a text which argues for the perspectival and limited character of ail knowledge. This latter is an issue which remains active throughout the essay as a whole. There is, however, another issue hère which should claim our attention. It, too, arises in this initial paragraph and is similar ly an undercurrent présent throughout the text: the description of hu- mans as "clever animais who invented cognition." The comparison of humans with animais is a particularly insistent device in this essay. Nietzsche will compare humans with gnats, spiders, bées, moths, and birds. Coupled with this is a continuai référence to nature. For instance, the reason Nietzsche gives for not resting content with the above fabulous descriptive of the human condi- tion, the impetus that engenders the remainder of the essay, is the fact that the fable does not adequately convey "how wretched, shadow-like, transitory, purposeless and fanciful the human intel- lect appears in Nature [innerhalb der Natur]."13 This "in Nature" is</page><page sequence="5">NIETZCHE'S CLEVER ANIMAL 305 curious. Where eise would the human intellect appear? The phrase clearly works to set up an opposition: there is nature and some- thing opposed to it. This something else can only be a human product, or the production of humanity itself which, to the extent that it appears shadow-like in nature, seems to be placed at some remove from the naturai world, as pertaining to a différent order. We corne, hère, upon a question that is woven into Nietzsche's text while remaining unresolvable: is humanity a part of nature or is it, indeed, the éruption of a break with nature, the origin itself of the unnatural? To what extent, in other words, is the phrase "clever animal" an oxymoron? In attaining this cleverness, i.e., cognition, has humanity broken with thè naturai order? And is it because of this break that nature, after having taken a breath awhile, con- demns thèse clever animais to death on a congealed star? It would appear that the continuai référence to nature (three times on the first page alone) is meant to set up a contrast on the order of nature versus the human order. But, as we shall see, the text as frequently undermines this opposition as it asserts it. Nietzsche wishes to argue that cognition is linked to a certain kind of haughtiness, pride, or vanity. Although it is "purely human [menschlich],"14 the possessor of intellect imagines that the world "revolves around" him- or herself. In expanding this point, Nietz- sche makes référence to the gnat: If, however, we and the gnat could understand each other we should learn that even the gnat swims through the air with the same pathos, and feels within itself the flying centre of the world. Nothing in Nature is so bad or so insignificant that it will not, at the smallest puff of that force cognition [Kraft des Erkennens], immediately swell up like a balloon, and just as a mere porter wants to hâve his admirer, so the very proudest man, the philosopher, imagines he sees from ali sides thè eyes of thè universe telescopically directed upon his actions and thoughts.15 Hère the gnat and the philosopher are presented as belonging to the same order. If the gnat has his vanities, perhaps the philoso- pher has his only to a somewhat greater degree. Yet if everything in nature "swells like a balloon" with the thought of its own self- importance, then, to the extent that humanity does so, to be hu- man is not to be placed outside thè naturai order. But, upon further considération, the whole metaphor, the anal- ogy between man and gnat, is more than a little suspicious. "If we</page><page sequence="6">306 PETER HECKMAN and thè gnat could widerstand [verständigen] each other," as if this were a possibility. What would it mean for the gnat to "under- stand?" Were the gnat to possess cognition would we not have to grant it membership in the human order, the order of intellect? This would be to subvert the argument that animais perceive in a way radically other than the human way, itself a récurrent argu- ment in Nietzsche's text.16 And what can it mean to say that there is "nothing in Nature" that doesn't puff up with "that force cogni- tion?" Have we not already been told that the intellect is a "purely human" phenomenon? Indeed, doesn't the possession of cognition define the human as opposed to the animal? In fact, the descrip- tion of cognition as a purely human power follows directly on the heels of thè story of the gnat/philosopher: It is remarkable that this is accomplished by the intellect, which after ali has been given to thè most unfortunate, thè most delicate, the most transient beings only as an expédient, in order to detain them for a moment in existence.17 Nietzsche argues, again, that intellect is human in that it stems from an incapacity relative to, which is to say in distinction from, animais. The intellect, as a means for the préservation of thè individuai, develops its chief power in dissimulation; for it is by dissimulation [Verstellung] that the feebler, and less robust individuals preserve themselves, since it has been denied them to fight the battle of existence with horns or the sharp teeth of beasts of prey.18 Let us briefly take note hère, because it will come up later, of the use of the term "dissimulation" as a description of what we must do in order to preserve ourselves. The generai argument, again, is that humans distinguish themselves from beasts by virtue of intel- lect, a point that has already been called into question by use of the comparison between the gnat and the philosopher wherein the différence between them appears to be merely quantitative. The phrase "clever animal" hides within it a question that has not been resolved. The issue will arise again, in thè story of the spider and the bee; but this narrative must be put off for a bit, for it is a story about the products of labor, and we must first understand what it is that intellect produces. This brings us, however, to the central epistemological issues of truth and knowledge. We put</page><page sequence="7">NIETZCHE'S CLEVER ANIMAL 307 aside, then, for a moment, the question as to whether humanity is or is not part of nature, in order to take up another familiär opposition. It would appear that the lie and thè metaphor are determinate to the extent that they distinguish themselves from truth and plain speaking. In the next few pages, however, we shall explore how Nietzsche's text dénies us the ability to rely on such a distinction. Generally speaking, the intellect tells lies, it dissimulâtes. These lies, moreover, generally share a common feature in that the décep- tion is flattering; thèse are lies of vanity. This identification of intellect and déception is one pole of the antagonism that génér- âtes the text, i.e., given this fact it becomes incumbent upon Nietz- sche to explain how something called "an impulse to truth" could hâve arisen. This latter development is odd, Nietzsche explains, because men are deeply immersed in illusions and dream-fancies [Illusionen und Traumbilder]; their eyes glance only over the surface of things and see "forms" [Formen]; their sensation nowhere leads to truth, but contents itself with receiving Stimuli and, so to say, with playing hide and seek on the back of things. In addition to that, at night man allows his dreams to lie [belügen] to him a whole life-time long, without his moral sensé ever trying to prevent them; . . . .19 So the lie that intellect produces in order to preserve itself is a kind of dream, a playing on the surface of things, which is not amenable to the strictures of the moral sensé. Let us take note of the set of oppositions at work hère, one term of which has been used to characterize the intellect, the other term of which has been left in abeyance, forming an amorphous background against which the features of the intellect may take shape. These are the opposition between the lie and the truth, the dream and waking reality, the surface as opposed to the depths, and vanity contrasted with mod- esty. Another striking image further associâtes the dream with riding on the surface of things, while at the same time resurrecting the animal motif and adding the élément of implicit threat which, as de Man points out,20 characterizes many of Nietzsche's images in this text. Man,21 Nietzsche tells us, indifferent to his own ignorance, is resting on the pitiless, the greedy, the insatiable, the murderous, and, as it were, hanging in dreams on thè back of a tiger.22</page><page sequence="8">308 PETER HECKMAN The text intends to shock. What you hâve hitherto construed as reality is a dream, your truths are lies, that which you hâve imag- ined to be knowledge is impossible. We exist in a realm of delu- sion, and it is nature itself which places us there: Does not nature keep secret from him most things, even about his body, e. g., thè convolutions of the intestines, the quick flow of the blood-currents, thè intricate vibrations of the fibres, so as to banish and lock him up in proud, delusive knowledge [gauklerisches Bewußtsein]?23 Notice the body, one's own physiology, offered as a paradigm case of the unknowable. And notice that phrase "delusive knowledge," another oxymoron offered as definitive of the human condition, another way of speaking of that unhappy human creature who both is and is not part of thè naturai order, who possesses an impulse to truth that cannot be fulfilled, who writes a "knowing" text care- fully explaining the impossibility of knowledge. We begin, then, with the dream and the lie, leaving the question of truth and reality in abeyance for a moment. Waiting in the wings, that is, but truth remains always présent, for to describe something as a dream is only useful given the contrast with some- thing that is other than dream. We will return to this truth momen- tarily left in abeyance, for it will emerge again as Nietzsche ex- plains how "the impulse to truth" has arisen. The impulse, Nietzsche explains, is a social produci. Because "man both from necessity and boredom wants to exist socially,"24 he must make peace with his fellows and settle on fixed désigna- tion for things, adopt certain conventions: For that which henceforth is to be "truth" is now fixed; that is to say, a uniformly valid and binding désignation of things is invented and thè legislature of language also gives the first laws of truth: since hère, for the first time, originates the contrast between truth and falsity.25 Hère, "for the first time" he says, émerges the distinction between truth and falsity, i.e., by référence to thèse fixed conventions we can tell the différence between the truth teller (one who adhères to the conventions) and the liar (one who abuses the conventions). But can this really be the first time? Isn't the lie presupposed hère? Doesn't Nietzsche mean to say that what he hère calls "truth" is in</page><page sequence="9">NIETZCHE'S CLEVER ANIMAL 309 actuality a lie which has become fixed and conventional? "Truth," that is, as a certain kind of lie? And if truth, hère, présupposes the lie, will not this lie itself presuppose another more fundamental truth? This latter truth, which we had left in abeyance, re-emerges hère. Consider Nietzsche's description of man as one who covets the agreeable, life-preserving conséquences of truth; he is indifferent towards pure, ineffective knowledge; he is even inimicai towards truths which possibly might prove harmful or destroying.26 What would "ineffective knowledge" be? What is a harmful truth? Hâve we not just been told that truth is actually fixed convention, engaged in precisely because it contributes to the social peace and préservation? Given this, "harmful truth" appears, again, oxymo- ronic. But of course Nietzsche is ref erring to a différent truth hère, so we must forget the "for the first time" of the above, for this harmful truth has already arisen in Nietzsche's text. Let us resur- rect this vision; it cornes both before and after Nietzsche's point about our ignorance concerning our own physiology: What indeed does man know about himself? Oh! that he could but once see himself complete, placed as it were in an illuminated glass- case! . . . . Nature threwaway the key; and woeto the fateful curios- ity which might be able for a moment to look out and down through a ere vice in the chamber of consciousness.27 Now hère is a familiär gesture. To coneeive of knowledge as clear vision under the proper illumination is as old as philosophy itself. As Derrida has shown,28 this particular metaphor structures philosophy from thè sun of Piato, the source of the good and the true, to thè naturai light of Descartes, in which alone the truth can appear, and beyond. Indeed, this is a metaphor that initiâtes phi- losophy itself as a dream of attaining clear vision, of obtaining literal rather than figurai meaning, of stepping out of thè cave and into the sun. What we are given, here, is a metaphor for non- metaphorical knowledge. But note that Nietzsche casts this in the mode of the hypothetical, indeed, of the counter-factual, itself a gesture we ha ve seen before. As /fwe could see ourselves in a glass case. So the truth, which looks as if it might ground the en tire vertiginous séries of exchanges between truth and lie that makes up the text, is itself offered as an impossibility. The exchange of truth for lie and lie for truth remains without foundation or limi t.</page><page sequence="10">310 PETER HECKMAN The "truth" as "direct acquaintance with things in themselves," is denied us, Nietzsche argues, for it is only through forgetfulness that we hâve e ver corne to imagine this acquaintance as a possibility. What is it that we hâve forgotten? We no longer remember that the relationship that holds between our words and concepts, on the one hand, and things themselves, on the other hand, is purely a meta- phorical relationship. "What is a word?" Nietzsche asks, "The ex- pression [Abbildung] of a nerve-stimulus in sounds."29 Let us merely take note, in passing, of an implicit bias hère, that particular "phonocentric" bias which Derrida has shown to be so pervasive within the tradition.30 For Nietzsche's assumption is that thè word is first and foremost a vocable; it belongs within the présence of the voice. Nietzsche's point, beyond this, is that thè word is primarily a metaphor for a nerve stimulus. What has occurred is a "carry-over," an "Übertragung," from one sphère into another, a "nerve stimu- lus" expressed in a différent medium: that of hearing, the aurai/oral. Ail this, as if our understanding of nerves has not already been called into question. Recali the example of our own physiology as paradigmatic of our imprisonment within ignorance. For Nietzsche, a metaphor is a translation from one dimension to another; and he will speak, in this context, of the différences between languages, or the peculiarities of a particular language: "We divide things according to genders; we designate the tree as masculine, the plant as feminine: what arbitrary metaphors! [will- kürlichen Übertragungen]"*1 The "arbitrariness" of the metaphor appears to be that which binds us within bonds of ignorance, the fact that a metaphor is "daring" is what places us at such a distance from reality: The "Thing in itself" (it is just this which would be the pure ineffec- tive truth) is also quite incompréhensible to the creator of language and not worth making any great endeavor to obtain. He désignâtes only the relations of things to men and for their expression he calls to his help the most daring metaphors. A nerve-stimulus, first trans- formed into a percept! First metaphor! [Metapher] The percept again copied into a sound! Second metaphor! And each time he leaps completely out of one sphère right into the midst of an entirely différent one. One can imagine a man who is quite deaf and has never had a sensation of tone and of music; just as this man will possibly marvel at Chladni's sound figures in the sand, will discover their cause in the vibrations of the string, and will then proclaim that now he knows what man calls "tone"; even so does it happen to us ail with language.32</page><page sequence="11">NIETZCHE'S CLEVER ANIMAL 311 Hère we hâve the metaphor which explains metaphor: a phe- nomenon of one sensé medium (sound) is "carried over" and ex- pressed in a différent sensé medium (vision or touch). Later in the text, Nietzsche makes the same point, using a similar metaphor for metaphorization but one that reverses the above and moves from the realm of vision to that of sound: A painter who had no hands and wanted to express [ausdrücken] the picture distinctly présent to his mind by the agency of song, would stili reveal much more with this permutation of sphères, than the empirie world reveals about the essence of things.33 We are trapped within ignorance because of our own incapacities: there is sound but we are deaf and can see only vibrations in the sand; we'd like to convey the image we've seen but we are handless painters reduced to singing our meaning. So it is the metaphorical character of our knowledge that guaran- tees our incapacity to attain the truth. But, as we've seen, "truth," in this text, is a term that lacks stability or fixity of character. The movement that takes place between the lie (as opposed to truth as plain speaking) and truth (now itself a kind of lie) is becoming a familiär gesture within this text. For the fact that the metaphorical nature of our knowledge deprives us of the "truth" is only meant as an introduction to the "truth" that is itself metaphorical, is itself just a certain kind of metaphor. So metaphorical knowledge, which initially determined itself in distinction from the truth of plain speaking, turns out to bear truth within itself, to engender truth. "Truth," in this latter sensé, is merely a metaphor which, Nietzsche tells us in a famous passage, has become "worn-out:" What therefore is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, métonymies, anthropomorphisms: in short a sum of human relations which be- came poetically and rhetorically intensified, metamorphosed [über- tragen], adorned, and after long usage seem to a nation fixed, ca- nonie and binding; truths are illusions of which one has forgotten that they are illusions; worn-out [abgenutzt] metaphors which hâve become powerless to affect the sensés; coins which hâve their ob- verse effaced and now are no longer of account as coins but merely as métal.34 Hère the text marks a transition. For we hâve moved away from a discussion of the distinction between metaphors and the unknown and unknowable X that they express. Now the distinction made</page><page sequence="12">312 PETER HECKMAN will take place within thè domain of metaphor itself . This is the distinction between perception (itself metaphorical, according to Nietzsche) and another kind of metaphor, thè "idea" or "concept." The essay, at this point, turns to the task of describing these latter metaphors. Let us, then, follow this thread, for it will re turn us to the issue of the "clever animal," the question as to whether or not man should be viewed as part of nature, whether or not he can be compared to the animais. Now to describe the "concept," as Nietzsche does above, as a metaphor which has itself become "metamorphized," is peculiar and not particularly helpful. More to the point is the suggestion that the concept is the resuit of a process of forgetting, a percep- tion that has become worn-out, a coin that has become fìat and useless through over-use. But let us not rely overmuch on the coin metaphor, for this image does not make the most important point concerning the "concept." The flaw which defines the concept is not so much that it lacks a face as that it lacks vitality. On the road to becoming "rational," Nietzsche teils us, man first généralises [verallgemeinert] all these impressions into paler, cooler ideas [entfärbteren, kühleren Begriffen], in order to attach to them the ship of his life and actions. Everything which makes man stand out in bold relief against the animal dépends on this faculty of volatilising [verflüchtigen] thè concrete metaphors into a schema, and therefore resolving a perception into an idea.35 Here is man, again, distinguishing himself from the animal order, the "clever animal" who escapes being an animal to the extent that he is clever. The distinction is founded on the possession of "ideas," perceptual metaphors that have grown cool, become pale, gone stale. The threat that they présent has to do with a feature they have that perceptions lack, the fact that ideas allow them- selves to be arranged; built, Nietzsche says, into "a pyramidal order."36 The édifice built from such material, however lovely and large it is, cannot support life. The great édifice of ideas [Bau der Begriffe] shows the rigid regularity of a Roman Columbarium and in logic breathes forth the sternness and coolness which we find in mathematics. He who has been breathed upon by this coolness will scarcely believe, that thè idea too, bony and hexahedral, and permutable as a die, remains however only as the residuum of a metaphor.37</page><page sequence="13">NIETZCHE'S CLEVER ANIMAL 313 Ideas are dead metaphors, then, cool, pale, and bony, pushed into pyramids and columbaria; the édifice of science, Nietzsche will teil us later, is nothing but a "cemetery of perceptions."38 Hère is man, then, that odd animal who distinguishes himself by constructing houses of death. Does he or does he not belong to thè naturai order? He does only to the extent that, and in the spécifie sensé in which, death can be said to be a "naturai" part of life. A stränge creature, this man, who "stands out in relief" against the animal kingdom. How, then, may we begin to understand him? Why, let us compare him with an animal; now, however, in order to stress a resemblance rather than a différence. For, again, this lifeless residue which marks the passage of the perceptual metaphor, this "idea" is not just embodied forth from man but is also ordered and systematized, connected to other dead metaphors in order to erect a structure. Man, Nietzsche tells us, constructs thèse bony buildings "with that necessity with which the spider spins."39 Mark this sort of necessity, a self-consciously natu- rai necessity. And like the spider's web, man's constructions are pliable and résilient, again a necessity of nature if they are to survive the implicit threat of a world in motion: Of course in order to obtain hold on such a foundation it must be as an édifice piled up out of cobwebs, so fragile, as to be carried away by the waves: so firm, as not to be blown asunder by every wind.40 Let us view man as a spider, then, as if we could understand the spider. And let us keep man, as arachnid, distinct from the order of insects: In this way man as an architectural genius rises high above the bee; she builds with wax, which she brings together out of nature; he with thè much more delicate material of ideas [Begriffe], which he must first manufacture within himself.41 Humanity, then, is more like a spider than a bee, for thè bee must bring her materials "out of nature." But should we so easily acquiesce to this metaphor? The bee, after ail, is obviously a social creature. And Nietzsche has already argued that the fixed conventions and dead metaphors are first and foremost a social produci, an epiphenomenon of our need to exist together in society. Let us take back, then, our previous assertion and acknowledge that man is indeed, much like a bee:</page><page sequence="14">314 PETER HECKMAN Just as thè bee works at thè same time at thè cells and fills them with honey, thus science works irresistibly at that great columbar- ium of ideas [Begriffe], thè cemetery of perceptions, builds ever ne wer and higher stories; supports, purifies, renews thè old cells, and endeavours above ali to fili that gigantic framework and to arrange within it thè whole of thè empirie world, i.e., thè anthropo- morphic world.42 Such an unhappy creature, this man, like and unlike a bee, being part of and yet other than thè naturai order, he builds a hive and fills its cells with death. Nietzsche's text, apparently intending to mark a distinction be- tween thè human and thè animai, does this within a rhetorical practice that works to erase thè distinction. Yet is this not just one example among others of a particular movement that is such a prominent feature of this work? Was this not thè same movement we saw in thè initial distinction between truth and lie, a distinction which similarly collapsed? Let us consider yet another familiär Opposition, thè one, for instance, between dreams and reality. It, too, will serve to exemplify thè particular movement of self- effacement which characterizes this text. The beginning of thè text uses thè dream to describe humanity's typical condition: "deeply immersed in illusions and dream fan- cies." This is an image of imprisonment, man immersed in illusion, unable to avoid thè deceptive character of his own intellect and see himself clearly, as if illumined in a case of glass. "Dreaming," here, is descriptive of scientific man, remaining within his comfortable castle built of "ideas," those desiccated metaphors. Later in thè text thè dream re-appears, but this time as a descrip- tion of artistic, as opposed to scientific, activity. Nietzsche remarks that man's essential activity, his impulse to create metaphors, is ultimately not buried beneath thè great bone pile, thè édifice of scientific ideas. Rather, this impulse seeks for itself a new realm of action and another river-bed, and finds it in Mythos and more generally in Art. This impulse constantly confuses thè rubrics and cells of thè ideas, by putting up new figures of speech, metaphors, métonymies; it constantly shows its passion- ate longing for shaping thè existing world of waking man as motley, irregulär, inconsequentially incohérent, attractive, and eternally new as thè world of dreams is. For indeed, waking man perse is only clear about his being awake through thè rigid and orderly woof of ideas, and it is for this very reason that he sometimes comes to</page><page sequence="15">NIETZCHE'S CLEVER ANIMAL 315 believe that he was dreaming when that woof of ideas has for a moment been torn by Art.43 Art, hère, is like a dream in being opposed to the "rigid and orderly woof of ideas." Opposed, we might say, as life is opposed to death. The dream that is art follows upon the heels of science, arrives by virtue of confusing what was ordered, by dismantling the bee-hive. Hère the dream appears as a libération, where previously it was a kind of imprisonment. Hère the dream is opposed to the "woof of ideas," the structure which encloses humanity in ignorance. Yet it was this woof that was itself previously described as a dream, the dream, we recali, in which we were immersed. The word "dream," then, is used to describe the intellectual order of ideas, yet the same word is used to describe the exubérant destruction of this order, the artistic activity of throwing the columbarium into confusion. The opposition itself, dream versus reality, is hereby called into ques- tion, a movement further enacted by Nietzsche's description of the "mystically excitable" early Greeks whose waking reality was more "akin to a dream," or "as in a dream." Hère the distinction be- tween dream and reality, an opposition woven into the text from the beginning, grows increasingly less crédible. The dream, then, serves as yet another example of the unstable dichotomies whose instabilities govern the movement of the text. A polar opposition is offered only shortly before the two pôles begin to exchange themselves for one another, translate them- selves into each other. The oppositions underlying this text are engaged in a process of metamorphosis. Let us consider, as one final example of such unstable opposi- tions, Nietzsche's concluding dichotomy between the rational and the intuitive man. The rational fellow is familiär to us as the inhab- itant of thè idea édifice, thè bone pile, thè comfortable hi ve he has made in which to preserve himself. In opposition to this, Nietzsche posits the "freed intellect" that can "deceive with injuring" and does not concern itself solely with man's comfortable préservation: Usually with gloomy officiousness It endeavours to point out the way to a poor individuai coveting existence, and It fares forth for plunder and booty like a servant for his master, but now It Itself has become a master and may wipe from Its countenance the expression of indigence. Whatever It now does, compared with Its former do- ings, bears within itself dissimulation [Verstellung], just as Its former doings bore the character of distortion [Verzerrung].44</page><page sequence="16">316 PETER HECKMAN All this as if Nietzsche had not already used the term "dissimula- tion" [Verstellung] to describe the intellect in its former behavior, when it was a servant, when it sought the préservation of the individuai.45 Moving, however, beyond this discrepancy, we are to recognize that the "freed intellect" is one engaged in confusing the columbarium, which identifies this intellect as an artistic one. This intellect, Nietzsche says, is "daring; with a creator's delight It throws metaphors into confusion, shifts the boundary-stones of the abstractions. . . ,"46 The freed intellect relies on intuitions rather than ideas and thus speaks in forbidden metaphors and in unheard-of combinations of ideas, in order to correspond creati vely with the impression of the powerful présent intuition at least by destroying and jeering at the old barriers of ideas.47 Now the question is whether this opposition between idea and intuition is really as straightforward as Nietzsche appears to présent it. Haven't we already heard of "daring" metaphors? The initial account of metaphorization, the discussion of the primary percep- tual metaphors, stressed their "daring" character, the fact that they were both arbitrary and novel. It did this in order to emphasize their metaphoric character, that they place us at a distance from things in themselves. Intuitions, it would appear, antedate the idea, in that they occur in the activity of confusing and scrambling the ideas. But Nietzsche's description of intuitions harks back to his discussion of perceptual metaphor, itself thè ancestor of thè idea. Consider, more- over, that every metaphor is, by définition, new and surprising, for it is this alone that distinguishes it from thè idea, the latter being a metaphor that has become fixed, con vent ional, worn-out, and life- less. The phrase "forbidden metaphors," in the above text, appears, then, to be something of a pleonasm. And the phrase "unheard-of combinations of ideas" offers itself as something of a contradiction, given that to the extent that it is "unheard-of" it has little to do with ideas, which are what they are precisely because they have been "heard of" and are thus conventional. The characteristic drift, which is my concern here, from the positing of an initial opposition toward its graduai erasure, is fur- thered by the concluding description of the rational versus the intuitive man. For although it may not matter much to learn that the intuitive man suffers more when he suffers (certainly a little</page><page sequence="17">NIETZCHE'S CLEVER ANIMAL 317 disconcerting given the glowing report on this fellow up until now), it matters a good deal to hear that the rational man, the proponent of ideas, "in his misfortune performs the masterpiece of dissimula- tion, just as the other did in his happiness."48 So the man of ideas dissimulâtes as well, thus the whole dichotomy between dissimula- tion and distortion falls to thè ground, and we lose our grasp on the distinction which warranted the différence between a rational and an intuitive man. Now both dissimulate, the only différence being when they do so. Nietzsche proposes a confrontation between truth and the lie and then allows the two to dissolve into one another, distinguishes between dream and reali ty, the rational and the intuitive, and y et works to subvert thèse distinctions. Perhaps none of this, after ail, is so surprising from a text which can assert, in the same breath, that "man has an invincible tendency to let himself be deceived,"49 and that "the standard of right perception does not exist."50 One finally begins to wonder if this work is ultimately capable of assert- ing anything at ail. But ail this is as it should be, for the text is concerned precisely with the difficulty involved in making asser- tions. Let us see how this difficulty manifests itself in connection with the main unstable opposition with which we hâve been con- cerned: that between man and nature. Consider "the seeker after truths." We know the pathetic fellow already: in seeking comfort and préservation he "builds his hut close to the towering édifice of science in order to collaborate with it and to find protection."51 Yet although he is familiär, we hâve not yet acknowledged what it is about his édifice that is so attrac- tive. What, hère, off ers protection? Nietzsche tells us plainly that the most distinctive feature of the édifice is that it bears our own features, it is thoroughly anthropomorphic: The seeker after such truths seeks at the bottom only the metamor- phosis of the world in man, he strives for an understanding of the world as a human-like thing and by his battling gains at best the feeling of an assimilation. Similarly, as the astrologer contemplated the stars in the service of man and in connection with their happi- ness and unhappiness, such a seeker contemplâtes the whole world as related to man, as the infinitely protracted écho of an original sound: man; as the multiplied copy of the one arch-type: man.52 The édifice of ideas may be a columbarian, but it is also a hall of mirrors. The difficulty with making assertions, then, is that they</page><page sequence="18">318 PETER HECKMAN only hold true of, and are only possible in, the anthropomorphic world that is our own création. One can only "assert the truth about things" in the spécifie sensé and extent to which one can "find" something one has previously hidden behind a bush. So here is the poor seeker after truths, seeking but never finding a truth that is not anthropomorphic, finding nothing he hasn't already hidden behind the bushes. But, of course, the important question here has to do with the authorial voice of the text itself . Can it, or should it, itself escape the situation it describes, an inability to utter anything but anthropomorphisms? To what de- gree can Nietzsche distance himself from the seeker after truths? Certainly there has been nothing in the text to suggest that the situation Nietzsche describes is a contingent one. Granted, the édifice of ideas can be subverted, its components re-arranged, but its présence cannot be denied. Of course Nietzsche's text cannot elude the situation it describes. But what is remarkable about this text is the extent to which it does not attempi to escape this situa- tion. Rather, it revels in it; the text enacts precisely the predica- ment it describes. I am not making, here, the broad, although significarli, point that a text concerning metaphor makes its point in a highly metaphoric manner. Rather, I am calling our attention to a text that argues for the anthropomorphic status of ail knowl- edge even as it shows this in its rhetorical strategy. For clearly anthropomorphism, the gesture of personification, is the most insis- tent gesture of the text as a whole. "Every metaphor," we are told, "knows how to escape" classification;53 the columbarium can "breathe upon" us,54 we hear of thè "eyes of thè universe;"55 "intel- lect," it is said "célébrâtes its Saturnalia,"56 or "wipes" an expres- sion of indigence "from its countenance."57 But it is the anthropo- morphization of nature as such that should catch our attention, for this is precisely Nietzsche's point. Notice, then, the initial fable where nature "draws breath" for a while, or the passage in which nature "keeps secrets" from man and has "thrown away the key" which might unlock her mysteries.58 A nature anthropomorphized, a nature constructed by human- ity, is no nature at ail. In that it wears a human face, and to the extent that Nietzsche straight-forwardly makes it wear a human face, nature cannot stand in opposition to humanity. The opposi- tion between man and nature, then, an opposition that is quite active in producing the effects of the work, expériences, in what is by now an old story, its ultimate dissolution.</page><page sequence="19">NIETZCHE'S CLEVER ANIMAL 319 The most salient feature of "Truth and Falsity," it appears, is an insistence on its own self-destruction. The text takes away with one hand what it gives with the other. It is a text not to be trusted. But let us return, for a moment, to de Man's claim, that the text "does rhetorically what it condemns literally." We can see, now, why this charge is almost, but not quite, correct. For in that the intellectual anthropomorphization of nature, the inability to attain a truth not already constructed by man, is impossible to avoid, condemnation is utterly inappropriate. Neither could nor should the text "liter- ally" condemn anything at ail, since the point of the text is exactly the inability to attain a "literal" truth. To say that anthropomor- phic truth is a necessary feature of our expérience is not to say that its dominance cannot be challenged; the columbarium can be thrown into creative confusion. This, indeed, is what Nietzsche has accomplished in "Truth and Falsity." For if the message concerns the impossibility of literal truth, the point cannot be made in a literal manner. The text must insist on the subversion of its own literal message; this is in order to show what cannot be described. An essay that attempts to cali truth into question necessarily prés- ents itself with a difficult problem. Hère I hâve tried to show how Nietzsche might hâve acknowledged this problem. Even were it the case that this problem is not resolved in "Truth and Falsity," to the extent that he makes us aware of the issue, Nietzsche fully deserves our attention.

I was thinking how the Metaphysicians, when they make a language for themselves, are like [image, comparison, a figure in order to signify figuration] knife-grinders, who instead of knives and scissors, should put medals and coins to the grindstone to efface the exergue, the value and the head. When they have worked away till nothing is visible in their crown- pieces, neither King Edward, the Emperor William, nor the Republic, they say: 'These pièces have nothing either English, German or French about them; we have freed them from all limits of time and space; they are not worth five shillings any more; they are of an inestimable value, and their exchange value is extended indefinitely.' They are right in speaking thus. By this needy knife-grinder's activity words are changed from a physical to a metaphysical acceptation.

Nothing could be more uncongenial to the technique of our own stage than the prologue in the drama of Euripides. For a single person to appear at the outset of the play, telling us who he is, what précèdes the action, what has happened so far, even what will happen in the course of the play would be condemned by a modern playwright as a willful, inexcusable abandonment of the effect of suspense. . . . Yet Euripides thought he observed that during these first scènes the spectator was so anxious to solve thè problem of thè background history that the poetic beauties and thè pathos of the exposition were lost on him. So he put the prologue in the mouth of a person who could be trusted: often some deity had to guarantee the plot of the tragedy to the public, to remove every doubt as to the reality of the myth - somewhat as Descartes could prove the reality of the empirical world only by appealing to the truthfulness of God and his inability to utter false- hood."

I have deep misgivings about the use of this particular synecdoche, which attempts to refer to the whole of humanity with a term descriptive of only half of it. The generai effect of this use is, in my view, pernicious. Nonetheless I have acceded to thè use of this term in this essay. This for three reasons: 1) Nietzsche's use of it is so pervasive that any attempi to get around it would constitute bowdlerization; 2) the stylistic inélégance of the alternatives; and 3) in an essay about metaphor, particularly anthropomorphic ones, and their effect on our thought, this use consti- tutes just one more example that helps to make Nietzsche's point. 22.
