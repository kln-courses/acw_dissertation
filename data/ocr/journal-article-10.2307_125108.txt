Taking a life course approach, it suggests that metal was used to convey difference within exceptionally complex and contrasting construc- tions of male and female life. Variation in the use of metal throughout the Copper Age was linked to shifts in the pattern of age-gender life course constructions. The expansion of metalworking in the early Copper Age may be regarded as a socio-cultural development of the categorization of the person originating in the late Neolithic, enabling those categories to be maintained and refined. The decline in metal produc- tion at the end of the Copper Age can be related to a reconfiguration of age and gender relations. The design of metal objects played an important role in expressing the performed relationship between biological and social life change. In mediating the life course, metal objects acted as foci of time, powerful symbols of life stages and events.

(Alcmeon of Groton, in Cole 1992) Introduction It is almost impossible to disentangle the process of ageing from the process of history (Spencer 1990). From birth to death, our lives are interwoven with historical change. Indi- vidual actions are set within frameworks greater than a single lifetime, while key moments in history are also key transitions in the lives of all who partake in them (Harris 1987; Spencer 1990). Furthermore, each individual lives a biographical history in which their life is punctuated by a series of significant personal events.

As a process, ageing is both universal and culturally specific in its social and material expression. It is also a personal experience. While individuals may have unique memories, the historical trajectory of their lives may be comnmonly perceived with regard to the cultural context in which they are situated: 'the careers of all persons are similarly structured in relation to the historical transition of their time; and the symbols and myths that compose this structure are interwoven with those of the more personal and routine transitions of life' (Meyerhoff 1978: 31). This paper addresses the way in which one such grand 'historical transition' - the first use of metal - was related to personal narrative, by exploring the role of early metalwork in constructing changes in the gendered human life course in the late Neolithic and Copper Age of the Carpathian Basin. An approach based on the notion of the 'life course' permits a contextually sensitive exploration of historically contingent constructions of human lives, rather than emphasizing a fixed cross-cultural sequence of events suggested by the term 'lifecycle' (Hareven 1982; Bryman et al. 1987; Hockey and James 1993). Hence diachronic changes in the role of early metalwork can be examined by identifying cultur- ally specific life course trajectories and age-gender transitions through associations between objects and people in mortuary contexts. In tracing these changes it is useful to make a distinction between. the use of copper as a material resource on the macro-scale of archaeological periods and the use of morpho- logically distinct copper artefacts on the micro-scale of individual signification (cf. S0rensen 1991). On the macro-scale, the initial expansion of metallurgy in the early Copper Age can be identified as a response to late Neolithic developments in the categorization of the person, enabling increasingly complex definitions of aged and gendered social identity. Conversely, the virtual hiatus in metalworking at the end of the Copper Age can be related to a reconfiguration of social relations in which metal was no longer necessary to maintain outmoded perceptions of age and gender. On the micro-scale, objects can be used to convey changes in age and gender identities throughout the life course. Indeed, the plasticity of copper and the ability to reform, reshape and recycle it mirror the fluidity of the life course, making it a particularly apt material with which to mediate such changes. The relationship between biology and culture inherent in the categorization of the individual can be explored through the symbolic relationship between the form and function of metal objects. Spatio-temporal fluidity in the creation of structural difference between individuals inevitably leads to questions regarding the ontological significance of our own modern categorizations of the life course. Material lifelines: copper as a social resource The first real copper industry in the Carpathian Basin emerged in the late Neolithic (Makkay 1996; Kalicz 1992), a time of increased ritualization and expression of social and</page><page sequence="3">Rings of life: the role of early metalwork in mediating the gendered life course 391 economic difference (Chapman 1994; Rackzy et al. 1996). The clarity of socio-spatial divisions within domestic structures (Hodder 1990; Raczky 1987) was mirrored by the broader division of space into mortuary and non-mortuary arenas, with the dead now buried in groups away from the houses of the living (Chapman 1994; Kalicz and Raczky 1987a; Kalicz 1970). On the Alfold Plain, the emphasis on communal identity expressed through intra-mural burial within tell settlements (Chapman 1994) gradually shifted towards expression of the social identity of the person. Figurative interest in the human body manifest in middle Neolithic pots and figurines (Raczky 1987) was replaced by the mortuary categorization of individual bodies. Particular emphasis was placed on sex difference as an important aspect of social identity. In the Tisza group, men were often laid on the right side and women on the left (Whittle 1996; Horvath 1987; Korek 1987). To the west, the Lengyel culture also saw the emergence of some of the first formal ceme- teries. Here too, side of burial was an important consideration (Kalicz 1970; Dombai 1960). The majority of late Neolithic copper objects are found in mortuary settings (Kalicz 1992), in addition to pottery, shell, stone, bone and antler artefacts (Raczky 1987). The copper finds display an inter-regional character and are not associated with a single culture (Kalicz 1992). With exception of a few points and needles, they are small orna- ments such as beads, finger rings or arm rings made from a minimum amount of metal (ibid.). However, the relatively small scale and technological simplicity of much of the copper industry (Shennan 1993) do not necessarily translate into simplicity of use. Copper has frequently been identified as a valuable commodity (Tylecote 1987; Mohen 1991). Copper objects are regarded as prestige items, constructing difference between individuals in terms of an implied hierarchy of wealth (Skomal 1980). Nonetheless, the significance of early metalwork may lie not in its use to mediate the single meaning of prestige, but in its ability to convey additional multiple meanings including age and sex. Late Neolithic Lengyel copper arm rings and finger rings are found primarily in the graves of skeletally immature individuals (Zalai-Gaal 1996) and this is also frequently the case in Tisza contexts. Copper beads were deposited with mature and immature individuals buried on both sides. However, in the Lengyel and Tisza cultures anthropological analy- sis suggests that they are most frequent in the graves of adult females (Zalai-Gaal 1996; Horvath 1987). The deposition of copper beads and fragments in 'ritual pits' within build- ings has been interpreted as a sacral use of copper (Raczky et al. 1996). This suggests a possible religious dimension to the social identity of individuals buried with copper arte- facts, as well as a potentially intriguing relationship between notions surrounding the construction of human identity and perceptions of buildings (cf. Chapman 1994, 1997; Whittle 1996). Thus, the late Neolithic life course was sexed and aged in terms of its use of metalwork, but not necessarily highly gendered in terms of the use of metal to mediate different life course trajectories for men and women (Sofaer Derevenski 1997a). This emerging and relatively unstructured emphasis on life course change was consolidated and elaborated at the start of the Copper Age. The importance of sexual difference reflected in side of burial remained a strong feature, with men buried on the right and women on the left. However, age and sex relations were further refined in mortuary contexts through the involvement of a greater number and variety of artefacts deposited with the dead and the</page><page sequence="4">392 Joanna Sofaer Derevenski development of highly structured gendered categorizations. Almost all early Copper Age graves contain grave goods, the few exceptions being mainly young children (Bognar- Kutzian 1972). An explosive rise in the quantity and variety of copper objects seen in the early Copper Age (Chernykh 1978; Kuna 1981), along with the first use of gold (Kalicz 1992; Makkay 1995), was therefore part of a wider development of tighter social description in the mortuary domain. Copper was by no means a universal mortuary deposit, but greater involvement of metalwork played a vital role in mediating corporate perceptions of social identity. Metalwork was actively used to create difference within complex and contrast- ing constructions of male and female life. The material elaboration of social identity and role of metalwork is particularly well illustrated by the Tiszapolgar phase of the site of Tiszapolgar-Basatanya. At this site careful description of individual inhumations (Bognar-Kutzian 1963) and anthropological determinations of age and sex (Acsadi and Nemeskeri 1970) permit detailed examination of the distribution of artefacts with age and side of burial. A variety of objects demonstrate associations with side of burial (sex) and clustering within an age range, revealing a large number of age-gender stages, particularly for right- side individuals (Fig. 1).1 From birth to c.5 years, right- and left-side burials receive few grave goods. However, at c.5 years burials of both sides appear to undergo a major change in perception with the sudden addition of a number of costume elements to the grave goods. Left-side burials receive finger rings and copper beads (in addition to bead girdles with which they are identified from birth to death). Right-side burials receive arm rings. Since costume is strongly associated with side of burial, the age of c.5 years may reflect a stage at which biological difference between the sexes, although socially recognized from birth, begins to assume greater cultural significance in terms of gendered social roles and contributions. From then on, there is increasing divergence in life course stages between the two sides of burial. Left-side burials appear to pass through two further life course changes. The first occurs at c.12 years when pebbles start to be deposited with the deceased, the second at around the age of c.40 years when left-side individuals lose both pebbles and copper beads and gain mussel shells. Right-side burials display a greater variety of life course stages. At c.15 years they begin to receive a series of animal bones. These are further supplemented at c.18-20 years, by cattle bones, pig tusks and worked bone objects. All of these artefacts appear to be carried through the entire remainder of the life course. However, at c.25 years of age, the arm rings gained in childhood (at c.5 years) are removed. There then follows what might be regarded as a liminal stage in terms of costume, where it is conspicuous by its absence. Only at the age of c.35 does it start to reappear in the form of a small number of individuals with copper beads and, at c.50 years, a shell disc. In describing the structure of the gendered life course in this phase at Tiszapolgar- Basatanya it is possible to distinguish both gradual and sudden changes over the life course. Gradual change with age refers to changes in the frequency of a particular arte- fact or group of artefacts over the entire life course. It is mediated through a gradual increase in the frequency of ceramics with age in burials on both sides and a shift in domi- nant blade type in right-side burials. Sudden change can be identified as the presence of</page><page sequence="5">Rings of life: the role of early metalwork in mediating the gendered life course 393 Side of Burial i __-_ ..... i1.,..i...... .. ... . ..^-........ . ... .

The variety of objects used to mediate gendered age stages suggests that being within a particular stage lends an individual a distinctive identity within a culturally constructed continuum of ageing (cf. Spencer 1990). The association of certain objects with a particu- lar side of burial, but only for a defined age range, reflects the existence of a broad cultural 'repertoire' of sex-associated objects from which particular artefacts may be chosen to signify a particular age-gender status (Sofaer Derevenski 1998). Although Tiszapolgair- Basatanya is one of the most extensively investigated sites of this period, it is not unique in showing such a sex-associated repertoire or age-gender artefact distributions. Similar patterns can be identified in other Tiszapolgar sites, particularly in terms of their use of copper ornaments to mediate sudden age and gender differences. Thus, although the increased frequency of metalwork in the Tiszapolgar culture has often been seen as driving changes in social organization through the generation of a prestige goods economy (cf. Chapman 1994), in the context of the gendered life course, it can be identified as necessary for conveying the complexity and nuances of exceptionally complex life course trajectories. The expansion of metalworking may itself be regarded as a socio-cultural response to developments in the categorization of the person originating in the late Neolithic, enabling those categories to be maintained and refined. However, social life did not remain static during the Copper Age. At Tiszapolgar- Basatanya, the Tiszapolgar phase was followed by the middle Copper Age Bodrog- keresztur culture. Typological sequences frequently regard the Bodrogkeresztur culture as an organic continuation of the previous phase (Kalicz 1992; Bognar-Kutzian 1973) but the structure of the gendered life course and the repertoire of objects used to mediate it changed dramatically. Only the timing of gendered changes in the life course of men at the age of c.20 years and c.35 years remained constant throughout both periods. Further- more, although the importance of sex difference in side of burial was largely maintained, there is a small but significant increase in the number of anthropologically sexed indi- viduals (mainly males) buried on the 'wrong' side (Sofaer Derevenski 1998). The overall impression of the Bodrogkeresztuir culture is one of simplification in the construction of both male and female life courses (Fig. 2). The age of c.5 years may remain a benchmark for left-side burials (as seen through the acquisition of cups), although at Tiszapolgar-Basatanya the small number of young individuals makes this assessment diffi cult (Sofaer Derevenski 1998). The age of c.20 years is perhaps more obviously significant for burials on both sides. For left-side burials this marks a sudden increase in the number of individuals buried in the cemetery, itself a statement of age and gender distinctions, and the introduction of pedestalled jars, bowls, dippers, pebbles, bone awls and bead girdles (although the sudden introduction of these items may simply reflect the demog- raphy of the cemetery). All these objects, except dippers and bone awls, are carried through the rest of the life course. Dippers are dropped at the age of c.40 and bone awls at c.50 years. Stone arrowheads and copper pins are introduced to right-side burials at the age of c.20. Later, at c.35 years, cores, copper awls and daggers appear. All of these objects (with the exception of the two daggers at Tiszapolgar-Basatanya which occur only at this age) are then carried through the rest of the life course. Flowerpot vases are dropped at the age of c.45 in right-side burials. Gradual life course changes in left-side burials are</page><page sequence="7">Rings of life: the role of early metalwork in mediating the gendered life course 395 Pedestalled Figure 2 The age structure of the gendered life course at Tiszapolgar-Basatanya, Bodrogkeresztiur culture. mediated through specific ceramic types (cups and bowls). They are entirely absent from right-side burials. In the Bodrogkeresztur culture the use of copper changed in line with the simplifica- tion of life course structure. Its role in constructing age and gender distinctions based on</page><page sequence="8">396 Joanna Sofaer Derevenski costume became redundant and it was now employed solely to signify male life course changes. As the use of ornaments (especially arm and finger rings) declined, there was a shift towards more massive objects such as daggers, pins, awls and, in some cemeteries, axes (Patay 1978, 1984). Copper was kept for distinguishing skeletally mature or older individuals. Thus, the reduction in life course complexity and the rationalized association of metal with men contrasts with technological advances in the production of metal arte- facts (Tylecote 1987; Kalicz 1992; Jovanovic 1991) and an increase in the quantity of metal used to create single artefacts. Changes in the form of metal objects also describe a shift towards more obviously utilitarian items. This may reflect a transformation in social perceptions of the function of age-gender stages towards the signification of socio- economic role and the division of labour. The reduction in the number of artefactually distinguished age grades in the Bodrog- keresztufr culture suggests that the social importance of age declined during the middle Copper Age. Gender roles and ideology were no longer as confining as before. Social distinctions remained important but they became more flexible as age restrictions no longer applied to some areas of social behaviour. The range of objects and behaviours in common to individuals of different ages broadened and, while sexual difference was still vital, the rigidity of divisions reflected in side of burial began to loosen. By the end of the Copper Age, social categorizations originating in the late Neolithic and operating on a reduced scale in the Bodrogkeresztuir culture had been almost entirely transformed. In Baden cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin, stringent rules surrounding the age and sex-related deposition of artefacts were relaxed, although the dead were furnished with similar general artefact types, including vessels, tools, arrow-heads and jewellery made of copper tubes, bone plates, perforated animal teeth and shells (Banner 1956; Kalicz 1970). Models of carts and cattle bones also appear in mortuary deposits (Soproni 1954; Whittle 1996). In the large cemeteries of the Danube valley, sex was not emphasized either through side of burial or through orientation. The number of multiple burials increased and, although inhumation remained the dominant rite, cremations are known from this period. The Baden culture represented a 'conceptual shift' (Whittle 1996: 142), an entirely new, more individualistic ideology (Hodder 1990; Whittle 1996) which did not involve identifi- cation with a closely circumscribed age-gender group as the primary determinant of social identity. Age and sex categories were broadly recognized, often through the size of the mortuary assemblage, but were not all-embracing; these elements of individual identity were both joined and influenced by an emphasis on kinship (Korek 1951), privilege (Sochacki 1980) and relations with animals (Whittle 1996). Baden pottery was burnished giving a metallic sheen. Its shape and decoration also appear to have been influenced by metalworking (Kalicz 1970). However, the use of metal itself dropped dramatically, the weight of the entire assemblage being similar to that of a single Bodrogkeresztuir axe-adze (Makkay 1995; Kalicz 1992). Relatively small ornaments again became the most common copper objects. Massive weapons and tools were no longer produced (Jovanovic 1996). The manufacture of gold ornaments also declined, marked by the disappearance of anthropomorphic amulets in the Baden and Kostolac- Cotofeni cultures (Makkay 1995; Jovanovic 1996). This sudden decline in copper production is often attributed to exhaustion of the</page><page sequence="9">Rings of life: the role of early metalwork in mediating the gendered life course 397 carbonate copper ore sources, disrupting the 'organic development of metallurgy' (Kalicz 1992: 13). However, this explanation alone does not satisfactorily account for the almost complete cessation of metalworking in both copper and gold. Why not seek out new sources of supply, recycle existing objects or pass them down to the next generation? Makkay (1996: 39) points out the relative ease of obtaining surface gold as recently as the nineteenth century. Given the changing role of metal in mediating difference as the structure of the life course altered in preceding periods, the decline in metal production can be related to the reconfiguration of sex and age-gender relations in the Baden period. As sex and age- gender distinctions became less central to the categorization of individuals and the organization of social life, metal was no longer necessary to maintain these divisions, changing the manner in which they were conveyed. In the Carpathian Basin, the hiatus in the use of copper prior to the introduction of bronze can be identified in terms of changes in the historical relationship between metal and its use to mediate sex and age-gender relations. Performing life: artefact morphology and meaning Changes in life course structure throughout the Copper Age illustrate the inherent fluid- ity of age and gender relations. Age-gender constructions acquire particular meanings within culturally defined settings. The ritualized programme of gendered life course stages seen particularly in the early and middle Copper Age can be regarded as life texts, scripts that guide progress through the journey of life (Cole 1992; Spencer 1990). These texts are open to broad interpretation, requiring performance in order to be read. Age-gender stages signified by artefacts overlap. Not all individuals in Tiszapolgar or Bodrogkeresztuir cemeteries display a complete set of objects related to their age-gender categorization, although most have at least one or more indicator (Sofaer Derevenski 1998). Thus, not all acts within the text need be performed for every individual. There is a hierarchy of performance involving the deposition of artefacts with the deceased; the most common age- and sex-associated objects such as ceramics are at the bottom medi- ating the identity of the majority of individuals. Less frequent although still highly aged and sexed artefacts such as metalwork are at the top and represent the ideal materializ- ation of age-gender relations. 'Text and performance are complementary aspects of the life course. It is through performance that the life-text is reshaped and adapted and given a specific meaning' (Spencer 1990: 18). The performance of meaning in mortuary contexts is not limited to the actions of the living in associating particular artefacts or groups of artefacts with the deceased. The morphology of an artefact may itself form part of the performance. Texts are structured by metaphor (Tilley 1999) and, within the context of the life course, copper artefacts of the late Neolithic and Copper Age act as 'solid metaphors' (Tilley 1999: 36), whose form is intimately related to function. Through metaphoric reference to that which is shared, the private can be communicated (Hockey and James 1993; Fernandez 1970) and rela- tional reference points established (Sperber 1986). The wider social construction of the gendered life course with its many component elements can be pinned down to the level</page><page sequence="10">398 Joanna Sofaer Derevenski of the individual as single objects are used to create meaning relating to the biography of a particular man, woman or child. In doing so, the object mediates a contextually specific relationship between biology and culture, acting as a link between deceased person and society. This articulation is not only rendered literally through intimate association between the artefact and the body, but is more fundamentally constituted through trans- formation of the biological sex and physiological age of the body into the culturally meaningful phenomenon of a structured life course. In this sense, dynamics of age and gender are played out through material culture (Kirkham 1996). Ringing the changes As their name suggests, copper arm rings of the late Neolithic and Tiszapolgar culture are found on the upper arm or above the wrist of the deceased. Further evidence for the way that they were worn comes from figurines such as the famous 'sickle god' from Szegvar- Tuzk6ves (Kalicz 1970). Arm rings can be assigned to three variants: spiral, with over- lapping terminals (the start of a spiral) and open (Bognar-Kutzian 1972). In all cases the arm rings can be regarded as 'unclosed'. In cross-section the copper strip may be flat, plano-convex, round, quadrangular or triangular with the point outwards. The terminals are rounded, flattened or tapering towards a point (Bognar-Kutzian 1972). Finger rings fall into same general typological categories although, particularly in the Tisza and Herpaly cultures, they sometimes have a spiral finish to the terminal (Kalicz and Raczky 1987a, 1987b). Placed on the body, the intimate relationship of these costume elements with the person lends them great significance. In contrast to artefacts deposited around the body in contact with the grave margin, the positioning of these copper objects seems to stress their personal nature and the importance of an individual's age-gender identity. The boundary between the body and the object becomes unclear as each becomes part of the other (cf. Latour 1993). The open spiral design of copper rings is vital to the mutual construction of technology and person. In the late Neolithic and early Copper Age, arm and finger rings are acquired at a very young age, a time of rapid physiological change. At Tiszapolgar-Basatanya for example, the period of life between c.5 and 25 years during which arm rings are worn coin- cides with a time of physical growth. The spiral form of the arm ring permits its gradual adjustment to accommodate this development; it can be easily loosened or tightened by altering the diameter of the spiral and the number of loops. Similarly, spiral finger rings can be manipulated to account for changes in size throughout the life course. 'Child size' rings found at other Tiszapolgar sites (Bognar-Kutzian 1972) illustrate the way in which the spiral form could be contracted or expanded. Crucially, the open spiral design also enables the ring to be removed. S0rensen (1997: 104) points out that the removability of an object is an important characteristic since it implies a physical relationship between person and object relating directly to the actions of placement and subsequent withdrawal. In the Tiszapolgar culture the male arm ring is always removed at the achievement of skeletal maturity. The removal of the arm ring can be identified as a deliberate act indicating a change of status in the individual. Thus physio- logical changes and their cultural understanding become key points in the life course as</page><page sequence="11">Rings of life: the role of early metalwork in mediating the gendered life course 399 'the trajectory of the body is given symbolic and moral value' (Prendergast 1992: 1, in James et al. 1998: 162). The signifying role of the body reveals the cultural 'habitus' (Bour- dieu 1977) and thus the socially specific meaning of bodily change and action. Founded in the physicality of the aged and gendered body, social identity is inextricably bound up with the use of metal. The ideal identification of body and society is actively held and maintained by metal objects. Technology and body are mutually imbricated (Latour 1993) as the interaction between technology and body signifies the social self. The twenty-year period during which Tiszapolgar arm rings are worn also represents a time of rapid social and intellectual development. The nature of a spiral or open design is such that it is unfinished: both beginning and end are ambiguous, left hanging in the air. Artefact design has a political and ideological significance (Norman 1998). Hence the design of the artefact may have been not only practical but also symbolic, signifying that the individual had not yet fully entered into the social circle. In the context of the male life course, the arm ring may therefore represent an extended period of liminality in which the individual is gradually absorbed into society. The symbolic dimension to artefact design is further emphasized by associations between skeletally immature individuals and spirals described in other media. At Zengovarkony, Lengyel pots painted with spiral motifs were found in juvenile graves (Dombay 1939; Dombai 1960). Arm rings are literal and metaphorical rings of life in which artefact form is intimately linked to its role in medi- ating elements of a structured life course. Objects found with skeletally mature individuals are not as plastic as arm and finger rings since their size and shape are not readily adjusted. In the Tiszapolgar culture, copper beads found with adult men are fixed on clothing as apparently permanent festoons (Bognar-Kutzian 1963; S0rensen 1997). At some sites, gold disks may be associated with adult men (Bognar-Kutzian 1972), perhaps paralleling the use of shell disks at other sites. Both beads and disks are rounded, finished objects whose closed circular design reflects the completeness of the mature adult. They are symbolic trappings of older age (cf. Durkheim 1893). In the Bodrogkeresztuir culture, the symbolism of spiral and circle lose their meaning as the years of skeletal growth are no longer signified. As a form of metalwork, arm and finger rings largely disappear from mortuary contexts. However, the association between maturity and 'finished' objects remains. Massive objects are deposited with skeletally mature adult men. The utilitarian as well as symbolic nature of many of these artefacts suggests their role as indicators of gendered accomplishments. Thus, there may also be status considerations, with the hierarchy of performance of age-gender life texts mirror- ing social hierarchy to some extent. The relationship between horizontal and vertical differentiation may therefore be more complex than has hitherto been realized within archaeology. Archaeologists have often tended to contrast horizontal and vertical differentiation with one or other predominat- ing according to the thrust of the analysis. Yet there is an increasing body of sociological and economic evidence linking the acquisition of material goods to individual action and stage in the life course (Dale 1987). Many models suggest that age relations are funda- mental to the relations of distribution (McMullin 1995; Datta 1996; Jappelli 1995). 'Changes in the structure of life course transitions from dependence to independence must simultaneously entail a restructuring of the relations between dependants and those</page><page sequence="12">400 Joanna Sofaer Derevenski on whom they make claims for resources' (Irwin 1995: 8). The exercise of power within a social hierarchy and the way that it affects action are therefore critical to understanding age-gender relations (Bury 1995). Time, timing and timelessness The sequence of life is moved through once and lived only once. Personal time, like historical time, is defined through a unique cultural trajectory (Harris 1987) in which the life course inevitably ends in death, not the completion of a cycle (Frankenberg 1987; Hockey and James 1993). Indeed, death truncates events, meaning that not all individuals pass along the same time line. Profiles of age-gender relations are movements over time in social space (Harris 1987), reflected and suspended in late Neolithic and Copper Age mortuary contexts. Elements of time are also intrinsic to the boundaries the life course creates within social settings as well as in the archaeological sense of periods and contexts (Sofaer Derevenski 1997b). As a concept, the life course is an external, culturally created notional period of time against which the life of an individual can be considered. Yet it also creates time internally for those who live within it. The very structure of time is vested in changes in relationships that define the life stages (Thompson 1990). Throughout much of the Copper Age, the timed loss or acquisition of objects form focal points and boundaries in the life course. Metal artefacts associated with the person help divide the life course into a series of stages and, as such, metal is actively involved in the construction of time itself. Metal objects act as foci of time, powerful symbols of life events and stages. Since the mobilization of resources is important to maintaining the structural integrity of the life course, control over the production and distribution of metal artefacts can also be understood as control over time. The accumulation of metal artefacts represents the accumulation of time by the individual. Indeed, metal has particular qualities that make it an especially apt material for mediating time; it can be recycled and reused, transformed from one form into another. Whittle (1996) suggests that the exchangeability of copper could define it as either impermanent or timeless. Age systems provide a 'time strategy', a notional text rather than a strict timetable for individual change (Spencer 1990) and a means of constantly being able to create and legit- imize difference between people. From the late Neolithic to the end of the middle Copper Age this strategy was based on a series of key transitions in which metal played an import- ant role in moving individuals into life stages that often lasted many years. Copper Age perceptions of time were not therefore smooth and flowing but a series of steps within the gradual and inexorable process of physiological ageing. Time was embedded in the chequered development of social relations and action (Gosden 1994; Spencer 1990) and invested in material culture. In the Copper Age, age and gender were intimately linked and structured to break up time into segments and create hierarchy from a 'natural' process (Sofaer Derevenski 1997b; La Fontaine 1978). This contrasts with an understanding of sex in which individuals will always be classified from birth as either male or female. GAge systems create figura- tive representations of time and, to paraphrase Durkheim and Mauss, "the classification</page><page sequence="13">Rings of life: the role of early metalwork in mediating the gendered life course 401 of time reproduces the classification of men"' (Baxter and Almagor 1978: 176). In contrast to the elementary structure established by immutable sexual difference (reinforced in archaeological methodology through anthropological sexing and identified in the archaeological record through side of burial), though age and gender both classify indi- viduals within the life course, they do not do so permanently. The boundaries that are constructed through the social recognition of age and gender are 'maintained by the very ritual which transfers individuals from one class to another in an ordered sequence' (La Fontaine 1978: 14). Such boundaries are culturally and temporally variable (Cole 1992). Within the Copper Age the structure of the gendered life course and the objects used to mediate transitions changed dramatically. Changes in the use of metal in segmenting the life course reveal varying notions about the role and timing of significant events. The temporal, contextual and gender-specific length and timing of stages raise questions regarding the ontological significance of modern categorizations such as infant, child, adolescent, boy, girl, man, woman, adult and elderly when applied to the past. These categories have meaning to ourselves. However, if we impose them onto the past, not only do we impose our own understandings of social identity, but we also impose our notions of time and how it is divided. By imposing predetermined categories we run the risk of erroneously turning the continuous variables of age and gender into discrete categories (Sofaer Derevenski 1997a, 1998). Given that archaeology deals with social change over vast spans of time it is import- ant to consider the implications of contextually specific constructions of social difference for the analysis of archaeological material. We need to explore categories within the data rather than imposing them from outside. Conclusion Natural and technological processes merged in the late Neolithic and throughout most of the Copper Age. Just as the life course was complex and multidimensional, so was the role of early metalwork. Social life was organized around structured age-gender relations that also incorporated sex and status as important elements in the construction of differ- ence and the manipulation of resources. One of the first uses of metal was therefore as a medium upon which to hook social ideology. People drew on metallurgical technology to materially articulate particular cosmologies by conveying changes in age-gender identity over the life course. The changing use of metal in the Copper Age was linked to shifts in the pattern of age- gender life course constructions as social interests were expressed and negotiated through the technological arena (cf. Dobres and Hoffman 1994; Dobres 1995). Although assump- tions of increasing social complexity are often intertwined with notions of technological development, especially in terms of metallurgical technology (Sherratt 1984), relatively simple copper artefacts appear to have been used in sophisticated ways. Furthermore, metallurgical developments manifest in the widespread deposition of massive objects in the Bodrogkeresztuir period, occurred at a time of relative simplification of life course structures. Technological changes do not necessarily imply greater complexity in the construction of social life, highlighting the dilemma of technological determinism (Smith</page><page sequence="14">402 Joanna Sofaer Derevenski and Marx 1994). Instead, the use of metal in the Copper Age was a socio-cultural response to perceptions of the life course and developments in the categorization of the person. Metal was first used systematically at a time when the material manifestation of social distinctions became increasingly significant. The rise in metal production in the early Copper Age did not in itself create new distinctions, but provided a means to reinforce and elaborate existing ones. More complex and stringent constructions of age and gender were made possible through greater use of metal, as reflected in an increase in the quan- tity and variety of copper and other artefacts deposited with men and women of different ages. The rapid decline in the use of metal in the late Copper Age can be directly related to the reconfiguration of sex, age and gender relations and a reduction in emphasis on age-gender life course distinctions, since metal was no longer necessary to maintain these divisions. It is the relationship between objects and people that gives the former their significance. Although copper is a single material it may acquire a variety of functions depending on the form of the artefact into which it is made and its association. The deliberate and careful design of artefacts may symbolically imbue meaning, providing insights into the character of life course stages. Artefacts may be used to manipulate presentations and perceptions of age and gender throughout the life course, particularly in terms of the culturally specific relationship between biological and social change. Metal was integrated into social life both in the historical sense of overarching struc- tural change and on the more intimate level of the construction of individual biography. Historical and biographical sequences of events were both mediated through metal and constructed by its use. 'Biography and history can be seen as mutually constituting and conditioning processes, but are better seen as different moments of a total social process which has collective and individual moments' (Harris 1987: 22). In the Carpathian Basin, the first metal was an integral part of this process during the late Neolithic and Copper Age.
