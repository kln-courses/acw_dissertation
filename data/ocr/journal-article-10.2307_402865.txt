<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOETHE'S FAUST AN INTRODUCTION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS OF GENERAL LITERATURE* Hermann J. Weigand The history of Doctor Faustus, the celebrated magician who sold his soul to the devil in return for a stipulated term of personal services, the revelation of occult mysteries, and diversified entertain- ment, was a thrilling horror story with an edifying moral. First pub- lished in 1587, it was sold like other "chapbooks" at country fairs year after year, undergoing a variety of versions. Without any pre- tension to literary form, it catered to the undiscriminating taste of a growing middle class reading public in an age of printing, discovery and religious controversy. It was immediately snapped up by Chris- topher Marlowe and turned into a play for the Elizabethan stage. Before long the theme supplied one of the lasting attractions with which troupes of travelling puppet players diverted their audiences. In the third quarter of the 18th century, young Goethe made the acquaintance of both the chapbook and the puppet show. Child of an age that experienced the world in terms very different from those of the age of the Refornation, Goethe sensed that the theme of Doctor Faustus harbored unlimited possibilities for expressing the altered and expanded aspirations of the human soul. In the early 1770's he began to toss off the first scenes of a projected Faust play. When in the fall of 1775 he came to the little duchy of Weimar where he was destined to spend the rest of his mature life, he brought with him a substantial number of worked-out scenes which luckily have come down to us in an unauthorized copy discovered more than fifty years after Goethe's death. The theme had implications beyond what Goethe had first imag- ined. He worked at it intermittently, but despairing of rounding it out, he published an unfinished version in 1790, Faust, ein Fragment. Under the prodding of Schiller, during the next decade, he set to * Professor Weigand's essay on Faust will appear in two parts; the second part is to appear in the January 1965 issue. (Ed.) 467</page><page sequence="2">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY work afresh and finally published Faust, Part One in 1808, carrying the work to the death of Gretchen, the Gretchen action constituting the most poignant episode in the Faust drama, but an episode only. Long before this, he had gotten to work on a second part, enormously differing from the first in style, setting, and perspective. Portions of Part Two were published during Goethe's lifetime. But when he finally put the concluding touch to his manuscript, in the year before his death, he sealed it up for posterity. The complete Faust drama was given to the world in 1832, some sixty years after Goethe had first set to work on it. Faust has become the legacy of a lifetime. It embodies the most mature distillate of the wisdom of Germany's great- est poet. The age of the Reformation saw the career of Faust as an object lesson and a warning. To the age of Goethe it was natural, on the other hand, to look upon the doctor-magician as a blurred and dis- torted prototype of man's ideal aspirations. This is the premise that explains Goethe's abiding attraction to the theme. Faust appealed to Goethe as a symbol of man's emancipation from authority. Regardless of whether Faust's path would eventually lead him to perdition or to salvation, his courage in daring to trespass upon the realm of the forbidden makes him a heroic figure charged with positive value. This is the age of the Enlightenment, and obedience is not one of its watchwords. The Judaeo-Christian pattern of thought continues to persist as the general framework of the philosopher's speculations and the poet's imaginings, but for the free spirits of the age it has lost the sanction of any ironclad dogmatism. A century earlier, Milton still founded his great poem of Paradise Lost on the theme of "man's first disobedience." This involved the axiomatic acknowledgment of divine arbitrary authority. The 18th century, on the other hand, was set to challenge all arbitrary authority, in the spiritual as well as the secular sphere. Mere power as such could compel submission but not induce reverence. Thus what had been branded as sin could take on the aspect of a higher glory. The criterion of moral value must now be sought in the essential nature of reason. Thus Schiller, lecturing to his students on the fall of man with the Biblical story as his text, is ready to concede that the fall precipitated a catastrophe. But he takes pains to point out that the fall was also an absolutely necessary first step in the higher development of mankind. With the fall, the mind of man embarks on the realization of its limitless potentialities. 468</page><page sequence="3">GOETHE'S FAUST. AN INTRODUCTION (PART I) 469 Without it, he would forever have remained a child of nature, inno- cent but ignorant, unable to develop the faculties of distinguishing between good and evil. And let us recall in the context the famous emancipatory gesture of Goethe's older contemporary, Lessing: If God were to stand before me, holding in his closed right hand the abso- lute truth, and in his left hand the unceasing search for truth but with the proviso of being doomed to stray from it for ever and ever, -if, thus standing before me he would ask me to choose, I would humbly say: Father, the absolute truth is for you alone, give me what your left hand holds. Autonomy as the premise of human dignity was never more pointedly formulated. Autonomy involves pride, and pride, we remember, was the cardinal sin of the fallen angels. Their rebellion sprang from "super- bia." But even Milton could not refrain from endowing Satan, arch- fiend and seducer of man, with qualities of strength, steadfastness, and endurance that lent him more than a tinge of the heroic. Faust also exhibits a pride that the Church would have branded as sinful, though it is by no means nihilistic in its aim. All in all, the situation conspires to make us approach the personality of Faust with a highly favorable prejudice. Let us go afield a moment longer before entering the portals of Goethe's poem. The spirit of Faust stops at nothing in its quest for self-realization. An exponent of this spirit, Faust, the individual, assumes symbolic significance as the extreme exemplar of the deepest drives of western civilization. Self-realization, properly considered, is a program with- out inner or outer limits. It is the spirit of total experiment probing the recesses of the individual soul, the relation of the individual to society, the relation of man to his terrestrial environment, the rela- tion of man to the universe. The hazard of self-destruction in the pursuit of this quest is a risk to be faced. In a supreme moment of his career Faust exclaims: "Dasein ist Pflicht, und wair's ein Augen- blick" - Total self-realization is imperative, even if it were only for a moment. This is the drive that made Nietzsche speak of himself as the flame that glories in consuming itself. It is the drive that Oswald Spengler, in his Decline of the West, saw as the central force that distinguishes the present cultural sphere from those of all former ages. In a subtle way it pervades one of the great books of our age, The Magic Mountain of Thomas Mann. Although its hero, Hans Castorp,</page><page sequence="4">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY seems simple, tame and even lethargic at first sight and far removed from the temperamental titanism of Faust, yet his surrender to disease is a decision involving, in his case, an infinite dynamic expansion and spiritual escalation. It is in essence the same as Faust's pact with the devil. At key points of the novel we ponder the recurring leitmotif: "It is more moral to lose oneself and even abandon oneself to perdi- tion than to preserve oneself." The word "moral" in that sentence has an ambiguous ring. It certainly carried no connotations of social adjustment. It stands rather for the response to an inner summons that transcends all considerations of personal "security." It spells experi- mentation in the widest ideological sense, involvement with the realm of the forbidden. If we substitute "nobler" for "more moral," this thinly disguised New Testament dictum (Luke 9: 24) stands out as the formula for a heroic ethic, a Faustian ethic. Without question, Goethe projected in the personality of Faust a sublimely noble aspiration of the human spirit. This does not mean, of course, that Goethe glorified Faust uncritically. That he was not blind to his dark and sinister side no thoughtful reader of the play can overlook. Even before his association with the Evil One, Faust is labelled a "superman" in a deeply ironical context. And with a deliberate eye to restoring a balance, he again employs the word "tYbermensch" in one of those very personal stanzas which he set at the head of his collected poems, in "Zueignung," 1784. In this poem Goethe uses the device of allegory to report on a vision during an early morning walk. When the mists that contested the power of the rising sun have vanished, the poet is dazzled by an apparition hovering in their place. He recognizes the female form as the Goddess of Truth and hails her with passionate joy. She has been his intimate since his childhood days, whereas his companions preferred to stray in pursuit of error. After this outburst ithe Goddess indulgently smiles upon him and replies: "Thou seest how wise, how necessary it was to reveal only a small part of my essence to you [she lumps him with his companions]. Scarcely having overcome the crudest error, scarcely having mastered thy first childish wilfulness, thou deemest thyself straightway a superman who can afford to ignore the ordinary duties. Art thou really so different from the others? Get to know thyself. Live in peace with the world." This poem, acknowledging Goethe's identification with Faust's immoderate aspirations, at the same time reduces his own stature to 470</page><page sequence="5">GOETHE'S FAUST. AN INTRODUCTION (PART I) 471 modest proportions and avows his dedication to a life of cooperation and service. After these preliminaries are we ready to enter the portals of Goethe's dramatic poem? Almost, but not quite. Like a stately edifice, the Faust drama has a gate, a portico, and an elevated platform which we must traverse before passing into the interior. The gate takes the form of a poem in which the poet, at an advanced stage of his life, invokes anew the airy shapes that haunted the young man's imagination and now press in upon him demanding that he endow them with substance. While the poem is cast in a melancholy mood, the portico, entitled "Prelude in the Theater," treats us to a spirited improvisation in which the director, the poet, and the clown discuss the impending production from a variety of angles, mixing business sense, seriousness and fun along with satirical shafts aimed at the expectant public. We pass right on to the elevated platform, the "Prologue in Heaven." Here we pause, to note the scene, the songs of glory, and the ensuing dialogue with the utmost care, for this is our initiation, in the heavenly regions, into the action that will take place on earth. The Prologue at once characterizes the Faust poem as epic drama, for as in the epics of the ancients, Homer, Virgil, Statius and the rest, down to Dante, Milton and Klopstock, the terrestrial action his its counterpart in the councils of the super- natural powers. The "Prologue" is a brilliant stage scene revealing the heavenly powers in the best anthropomorphic tradition-the Lord, flanked by three archangels, with the lesser hosts in the background. The paeans of praise deserve the student's closest attention in their blending of the old and the new astronomy (the sun and the lesser planets re- volving around a motionless earth, and the earth in rotation), their Pythagorean reference to the music of the spheres, their simple mythol- ogy (the setting of the sun a journey's end), their literary synaesthesia (the rendering of light in terms of sound), their references to the forces of the tides and meteorology, and finally their climactic allu- sion to the still, small voice of the prophet Elijah's vision (I Kings 19: 12). The setting is solemn and dignified, but the ensuing dialogue is at once shot through with satire and humor. We see the Lord of the universe engaged in an inspection tour that has brought him to the vicinity of the earth. Closely following the analogy of the Book of Job, Satan-Mephisto, the wag ("der</page><page sequence="6">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Schalk"), the least distasteful to the Lord of all the spirits of nega- tion, comes to pay his respects to the Lord with guarded mock reverence for the Almighty, with jibes at the "domestics" ("das Gesinde") and a parodistic echo of their strains of praise, and he launches into a tirade of criticism levelled at man, ithe little god of creation, and at the Creator for having endowed him with the am- biguous gift of reason. When the Lord interrupts with a reference to Faust, the most exalted exemplar of the breed, Mephisto gives full rein to his satirical vein, characterizing Faust as mad and proposing a wager to the Lord that, granted permission to ply him with his arts of seduction, he will succeed in deviating this soul to his own ends. The Lord, with great tolerance and unperturbed confidence in the sound kernel of Faust's soul, grants the desired permission for the dura- tion of Faust's sojourn on earth, implying that there is more to come. The Lord's generalization about "a good man," with obvious applica- tion to Faust, his "servant," shows that his concept of the "good" transcends the standards that associate the term with divinely and socially sanctioned norms of moral behavior. His unfathomable toler- ance of the self-assertive spark differentiates him radically from the Biblical Jehovah whose wrath doomed disobedient man to perdition. Inasmuch as the Lord of the "Prologue" must be taken as the source of infinite goodness, power, foreknowledge and wisdom, there can be no doubt as to the ultimate discomfiture of Mephisto. That Faust will be saved in the end is programmatically certain. It may be puzzling in terms of this view that Goethe entitled his poetic drama a tragedy. Would not the outcome have equally justified the title of comedy in the sense used by Dante? But the solemnity of the action, in analogy to Greek drama may have been decisive in warrant- ing this label. This, however, is a question that the reader of the whole drama may be left to ponder. The first four scenes of the human drama, a unified sequence spanning one night and two days, show how the impatient, frustrated idealist is induced to enter into an association with the "spirit of negation," that is destined to cast its shadow over the rest of his earthly life. The first scene develops Faust's situation and his per- sonality in a dazzling variety of facets. It unfolds chiefly by way of a very extended dramatic monologue, interrupted by dialogue pas- sages that allow no monotony to develop-the apparition of the Earth Spirit, the dialogue with his assistant Wagner ,and the pealing 472</page><page sequence="7">GOETHE'S FAUST. AN INTRODUCTION (PART I) 473 of the bells and the chorus of Easter voices at the climactic moment. On stage the dramatic monologue usually suffers drastic cuts. Its extreme length and subtlety over-tax the capacities of both the aver- age theater audience and all but the greatest actors. But for the reader who yields to its spell every line carries its own emotional charge born of Faust's situation and the visible and tangible associa- tions that stream down from the clutter of the high, musty study. With two exceptions: (1) The opening paragraph is a deliberately archaic piece of exposition, evoking the age of the Reformation and the verse form of its most popular poet, Hans Sachs, by its prosy diction and the mechanical rhythm of its four-beat couplets. (2) Later on we come across one more passage where Faust, in the trough of the emotions that tossed him, reflects in general terms on the theme of anxiety as the most corroding affliction of the human race. This does not seem to relate to his immediate state of mind, but we are forewarned of what is coming when Anxiety, in the guise of a spectral sister, confronts Faust on the last night of his life as his most sinister assailant. But apart from these two passages all the rest of Faust's monologue has the compelling power of spontaneous improvisation. This effect is achieved by a most felicitous blending of form with content that has been the despair of all translators. The lyrical pitch of the diction, vocabulary, and sentence structure varies from mood to mood. The lines are not of a set length but swell from four to five and six-beat waves to return at will to lesser undulations. The rhyme scheme operates with equal freedom, now joining lines in couplets, now looping two pairs, now circling an inner by an outer pair, now binding triple lines or triple pairs together, employing a free alternation of one syllable rhymes with those of two. These few remarks on form must suffice. They apply in large measure to the whole of Part One of the drama. In Part Two the problems of form are far too complex even to be touched upon here. The middleaged scholar, who recapitulates his career in the open- ing lines, is a man wearied and exhausted to the breaking point. He has mastered all the substance and all the techniques of the total medieval university curriculum. The intangible abstractions of logic, metaphysic and theology have left him disillusioned. He is equally fed up with the procedures and yields of the practical professions, law and medicine. The satirical colloquium to which Mephisto treats the eager Freshman in a later scene merely transposes all of Faust's</page><page sequence="8">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY feelings on these metters into a humorous key. Faust is in deadly earnest. Words have assumed a hollow ring. Words are a device to conceal fundamental ignorance. Words provide no tool for a break- through from the world of appearance to the world of essence. In scene after scene Faust harps on this central fact. This is his frustra- tion. He conceives of the world in terms of a pantheistic reinterpreta- tion of Scripture. Creation (God, Nature) is a divine, eternally emerging process. He affirms it with all his soul. Is he not cast in the Creator's own image, part of his essence? Is it not his birthright, then, to participate consciously in the sublime dynamic process? Is he not higher than the angels-mere ministrants they? This is the re- peated starting point of his broodings after his rejection by the Earth Spirit. Meanwhile, in the opening passage, he gives only a passing glance to the thought that riches and honors, attending the pursuit of worldly success, have passed him by. In his frustration he has taken recourse to magic as a possible shortcut to the spiritual revelation he longs for with every fibre of his being. Impatience dictates this bold and forbidden course, a fever pitch of frenzied affirmation. At this stage the spirit of negation is utterly foreign to him ("Ein guter Mensch," the Lord termed him). Faust is a rebel only as regards the barriers of sense that keep him from communing directly with the divine spirit. Philosophically speaking, he storms against being hemmed in by space, time and causality. Rationally considered, Faust's be- havior is quixotic, but a kindred spirit, Heinrich von Kleist, in the age of Kant, clutched at the same motivation in exhibiting the tan- trums of a total nervous collapse, and in our own century Rainer Maria Rilke directed the hysterical drum fire of his "Spanish Trilogy" and the bleak despair of the eighth Duino Elegy against the intran- sigeance of the subject-object relation as conditioning man's com- munication with the universe. Yet even while overreaching himself, Faust tempers his folly with some discretion. Contemplating the magic symbols drawn by the renowned master's own hand, he turns from the figure suggesting the workings of the universal spirit as too vast for his comprehension. He hails the Earth Spirit, the lesser deity that dwells in the earth like the soul of man in the body, as the more fitting object for his empathy. His ardor is rewarded by a manifestation. Recoiling in terror from the insupportable light, he hears himself gently reassured and chided with mild irony. Then, with a superhuman burst of courage 474</page><page sequence="9">GOETHE'S FAUST. AN INTRODUCTION (PART I) 475 Faust rises to the challenge of the unique moment to proffer himself to the apparition's embrace, only to find himself put in his place by a terse, definitive rejection. But before Faust has time to come to terms with his humiliation his assistant's knock at the door dispels the mood. Faust dislikes and despises Wagner's fawning airs and his careerist aspirations. That he reveals no trace of these personal feelings either in the midnight discourse or on the next day's afternoon walk, bears testimony to his generosity and humanity. Faust is no cynic. He does not vent his pessimism in taunts and sarcasms levelled at his fellow man. He strives to educate by example and precept. Throughout the dialogue, the issue is sharply drawn between sincerity and scheming, simplicity and pretension, dedication and self-seeking, between earnest self-examination and easy complacency. After Wagner has left, Faust's mind returns to the vision, to assess its impact. His ego has suffered an annihilating deflation. His buoyant feeling of participating in the creative pulse, on a par with the gods, has been cruelly exposed as brash presumption. Sharp de- spair yields to the softer hurt of self-pity, inducing a mood of quieter, almost impersonal meditation on the theme of anxiety. But his brood- ing soon reactivates the sting of his having been called a worm. He indulges in self-laceration as he develops the parallel between the worm grovelling in the dust with his own life. Now the paraphernalia of his cluttered study meet his eye to mock his existence. Item after item-the stacked books and rolls, the grinning skull, the obsolete and useless machinery on which his misguided father pinned his faith -stare him in the face as so much dust. But when he spies the vial that harbors the potent poison that he has decocted, his mind veers to a different tack. In a twinkling he has rebounded from his despair to salute suicide as the most thrilling of all adventures. His imagina- tion straightway paints the exploit in the most glowing poetic colors. All his manly self-esteem is revived at the thought of setting his course to the Unknown, of facing a Beyond that childish imaginings have invested with unspeakable horrors, of facing, what might prove to be total annihilation, not in a frenzied access of blind impulse, but open-eyed, calm, serene. In a state of tempered euphoria Faust takes from the shelf the precious chalice, removes its case, and, reminisc- ing on its festive function in the days of his youth, he pours the poison and raises the cup to his lips. The Easter bells and chorus</page><page sequence="10">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY stay his hand. Though they cannot rekindle his faith in the miracle of the resurrection, memories of the fervent piety of his childhood crowd in upon him. His mood is softened, and the momentum for taking the irretrievable step is lost. The scene of the Easter walk reinforces some important aspects of Faust's personality that were only lightly touched on in the initial scene. Faust's deep love of nature, already glimpsed in his invocation of the moon, finds full expression in the rapturous lyric passage with which he greets the spring landscape and its festive human throng. He mingles with the simple folk and receives the tribute of their love and respect with unaffected modesty. Their praise of his dedica- tion and success during the plague he counters with the admonition to give credit where it is due, to the helper above. To infect them with irreverent skepticism is the last thing he desires. But most im- portant, the allusion to the plague has touched in Faust's soul a com- plex of confused and bitter grief. He confesses the young man's im- portunate piety, the ascetic zeal with which he tried to bend the will of heaven to his desire. Evidently, Faust is of the stuff that great saints are made of. Then he speaks with guarded criticism of his father as having been deluded into the blind alley of alchemy: Dis- pensing his nefarious concoctions in good faith, he and his colleagues perpetrated wholesale murder surpassing the ravages of the plague. The honest intent may exonerate his father, but it cannot efface a deep sense of guilt on Faust's own part. And the extreme emotional outburst about "the impudent murderers" helps us to see two enig- matical lines of Scene One in perspective. The lines, "What you have acquired from your forefathers, assimilate it in order to possess it," had seemed to interrupt the expression of a desire to be rid of all that had been handed down to him, with a puzzling non sequitur. Those lines make sense as the quoting by Faust of a familiar adage. But in his mouth the adage has the ring of bitter irony as the re- pudiation of his traditional heritage.-The end of the scene introduces the poodle in the guise of which Mephisto is to make his debut. Returned to the study that on the previous night had twice seen the superman poised on the brink of annihilation, Faust is about to make the acquaintance of his satanic companion. Scene Three, a theatrical show-piece, unfolds in three stages-the problem of scrip- tural translation, the exorcism, and Faust's dialogue with the travel- ling scholar. This scene shows Faust at his best. Having bathed in 476</page><page sequence="11">GOETHE'S FAUST. AN INTRODUCTION (PART I) 477 the fresh air of the woodland hills, he is cleansed and tranquil, at peace with himself and aglow with the love of God and his fellow men. In this mood he yields to the impulse to translate a New Testa- ment passage from the Greek. No believer in the dogma of the Church, but in search of revelation everywhere, he finds its purest spring in the New Testament. Characteristically, he turns to the open- ing chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John which, in contrast to the three "synoptic" gospels, exhibits a blend of Hellenistic mysti- cism with the Jewish ideas of the promised Messiah. The very first verse stymies Faust's efforts: "In the beginning was the word." The word, the "logos," a term of the most elusive connotations, is not fit to be rendered by the prosy German equivalent, "das Wort," an empty husk against which he had railed bitterly. He casts about for a term that might more adequately spread its aura over the page. In this his effort he appears as the double of Martin Luther who set his aim to render the spirit of the gospel rather than the letter. Faust's concentration is disturbed by the antics of the restless poodle. When repeated attempts to quiet the animal fail, Faust senses that there is something wrong, and the transformation of the dog into a monster presently confirms his suspicion. Not for a moment at a loss to meet the challenge of what he assumes to be an elementary spirit, he recalls the magic formulas that are applicable in such a case. He proceeds to smoke out the spirit with a systematic series of exor- cisms. Readers who wish to inform themselves on the nature, appear- ance and habits of the elementary spirits as well as on their com- merce with mankind, will find their curiosity satisfied by a highly ingenious "scientific" tract on the subject (available in English trans- lation) by the renowned Swiss physician, naturalist and philosopher Paracelsus, a contemporary of our Doctor Faustus. If readers wish to pursue the matter further, they will find a highly instructive and tragic application of Paracelsus' doctrines as regards the inhabitants of the watery realm in a celebrated romantic tale, Undine, by the German poet Fouque. When his sundry exorcisms all fail to work, Faust changes his diagnosis: Since this is not a neutral elementary spirit, it must be a demon out of hell. This calls for more potent incantations. Working himself up to a fever pitch of excitement, Faust cudgels the recalcitrant monster with spells that circumscribe the mystery of the eternal only- begotten and his passion. These, and the threat of the irresistible</page><page sequence="12">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Trinitarian thunderbolt, take effect: In place of the shapeless monster there stands the harmless figure of a travelling scholar. Do we find this confusing? This man, who had dismissed hell as a figment of morbid fantasy, this man, who had expressed his dis- belief in the glad Easter tidings-this same Faust has now worked a miracle with magic spells that derive their potency from the assump- tion of the Christian mysteries as valid realities! This is paradoxical. We note this only in passing; for Faust is not the man to solve the riddle of the Beyond. His mind dwells in a kind of limbo swarming with mutually contradictory images and concepts. For the moment he is completely occupied with his visitor. What strikes us throughout the ensuing dialogue is Faust's com- posure, his superior control in the presence of the infernal emissary. The first interchange establishes Faust as master of the situation. Assuming a condescending tone, he displays active curiosity without a trace of nervousness: He listens to the riddling answers, the boasts and tantrums of his visitor with grave concern and mild amusement. To the spirit of negation he opposes his deep, positive reverence for the eternal mysteries of Nature's creative workings. The professor even lectures the devil on the folly of his impotent negativism and admonishes him to mend his ways. To his surprise Faust discovers that the devil has allowed him- self to be caught in a trap. The handling of this all but incredible situation (against the background of the folk image of the devil as an essentially stupid fellow, easily tricked) shows a most ingenious interplay of chance and design: The poodle, evidently bent on no more than a bit of preliminary reconnoitering, has been forced to show his hand prematurely. Faust's self-confidence is heightened by the discovery that he has the visitor in his power. When his prodding questions bring out the fact that demons who invade the human realm are governed by strict rules of behavior, it is Faust who takes the initiative in broaching the idea of a pact, and it is Mephisto, caught off guard, who has to resort to a delaying action. Eventually Mephisto, apparently resigned to the situation, puts his captor to sleep by a ruse and makes his escape. Faust awakens in a state of redoubled frustration. The next scene brings the great showdown, Faust's wager and pact with Mephisto. The time, the morning after; and Faust in a 478</page><page sequence="13">GOETHE'S FAUST. AN INTRODUCTION (PART I) 479 morning-after mood, a colossal hangover after the series of emotional shock waves that had battered him continuously for two nights and a day-the ups and downs of the blinding apparition called forth by his incantation; the great rebound of the suicidal venture, frustrated by the Easter bells; the lyrical exaltation of the Easter walk, brusquely turned into deepest despondency by memories of his part in the plague; the recovery of his buoyancy by the spectacle of the sunset; the serene atmosphere of high peace that prompted his turning to the gospel; the terrific excitement of the exorcism; the sense of mastery in his dialogue with the spirit of negation; the glimpse of a new approach to the cosmic mysteries; and finally, the sense of let- down and utter humiliation on awakening from his trance. All this has left him at a dead center of total exhaustion. On this morning the tables are turned. The initiative has passed to Mephisto. Even before the smart cavalier enters the study, Faust's irritability is established as he is made to repeat the invitation to enter three times. He is in a devastated mood. There is no fight left in him. He is querulous, petulant, whining. His emotional tone is slack, unstrung. His harping on the theme of renunciation, his com- plaints about the staleness of his days and the terrors that haunt his nights mark him as the victim of an anxiety neurosis in the making. His attempts to wax lyrical in his laments appear forced, reminding us of the distorted tones of a worn-out record. Each of Mephisto's amused taunts and jibes makes him wince. Before long he flies into an uncontrollable rage that finds expression in a tirade of curses so all-inclusive as to leave no value intact. His foremost curse is levelled against the pride of his pretension to superman status. Next he re- viles the sentimental softness that kept him from following through with his intended suicide. He then curses all the lure of the world of sense with its challenge and its invitations to pleasure. The climax is reached in the curse that he hurls against the highest boon of love, meaning, without question, not the love of the sexes, but the core of the Gospel message: "For God so loved the world . . ." In the wake of this blasphemy he curses the other cardinal Christian virtues, faith and hope, topping off his tirade with a curse against patience, the virtue most alien to his impulsive temperament. With these curses Faust, so positive heretofore in his reverent affirmation of the creative process as divine, has yielded to the spirit of negation. His curses are an echo of the tempter's nihilism. They mark a turn-</page><page sequence="14">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY ing point. Henceforth the infection of radical evil festers in Faust's blood. Naturally, this violent swing of the pendulum provides for its own correction. In the remainder of this inexhaustibly rich scene Faust soon regains his balance. When Mephisto approaches him with a concrete proposal for their permanent association, with the forfeiture of Faust's soul in the Beyond as the price, Faust counters with a wager that shows him an alert and shrewd bargainer. The substance of the wager on which he conditions the pact is that Mephisto will never succeed in extinguishing the restless urge that makes Faust forever reach beyond the illusory satisfaction of the moment; that Mephisto will never succeed in lulling him into a sense of ease and contentment. In the text of the play the crucial lines of the wager read as follows: Werd' ich zum Augenblicke sagen: Verweile doch! du bist so sch6n! Dann magst du mich in Fesseln schlagen, Dann will ich gem zugrunde gehn! Dann mag die Totenglocke schallen, Dann bist du deines Dienstes frei, Die Uhr mag stehn, der Zeiger fallen, Es sei die Zeit fir mich vorbei! (If you ever hear me say to the passing moment: "Do linger, you are so beautiful!," then you may clasp me in fetters, then I will gladly perish. Then may the funeral bell toll, then your term of service is done. Let the clock stop, the hour hand fall. Let my time be over!) Two lines, that formulate the condition, are followed by seven swift, short sentences that draw the conclusion. The four times re- leated dann reverberates like the measured strokes of a gong. The words I have set in italics are destined to recur verbatim at the moment of Faust's death. Mephisto underlines the significance of the pronouncement with the reminder to Faust: "Mark your words well. We shall not forget!" There is superb irony in the fact that, when Faust has breathed his last, Mephisto misquotes a crucial word and has to stand corrected by his minions, who have remembered the exact wording. After Faust has reluctantly gone through with the "farce" of signing the contract with a drop of his blood, he expatiates in a 480</page><page sequence="15">GOETHE'S FAUST. AN INTRODUCTION (PART I) 481 series of swiftly changing moods on the meaning of the momentous step he has taken. Dejection and elation spell each other off. The immediate vista is a mad, pointless whirl of dissipation. A moment later his energies rebound with the resolve, now that all prospects of an intellectual breakthrough have gone sour, to encompass in his individual person the totality of experience open to mankind, the whole gamut of the emotional life of the race, all its joys and pains, with ultimate annihilation as the end. Mephisto finds amusement in pointing out to him that he still persists in his aim to unite incom- patibles, and once more Faust wallows in the trough of dejection. The impasse is broken by Mephisto's arrangements for the two of them to set out at once on a life of adventure in the world, leaving the musty study behind. As Faust goes to gather up some necessaries for the trip on the magic cloak, Mephisto regales the eager Freshman with his satirical wisdom. Now follow the scenes of Auerbach's Cellar in Leipzig that night, and the visit next day to the witch's kitchen to accomplish Faust's physical rejuvenation. They need not detain us long. The roisterous atmosphere of the wine cellar, where Mephisto befuddles the drunken students with his magic tricks, may bring to mind the grosser aspects of Shakespeare's Falstaff scenes. It is entertaining in its triple per- spective of the students' coarse antics, Mephisto's delight in leading them by the nose, and Faust's bored impassivity throughout. In the witch's kitchen the situation is similar: Mephisto has a wonderful time enjoying first the grave nonsense of the animals that watch the boiling cauldron in the absence of their mistress, then in relishing the hysterical fury of the witch making her way down the chimney, and her consternation in recognizing the intruder as her master. Faust shows not the slightest interest in all the nonsense and obscenity. Only one thing catches Faust's attention, a magic mirror. It dazzles him with the elusive shifting image of the most beautiful woman the world has ever seen, Helen of Troy. He reluctantly leaves it to submit to the ritual hocus-pocus of the potion that is to rekindle in his veins the sexual fire of adolescence. The stage is now set for the Gretchen tragedy, the absorbing theme of the last third of Part One. In the overall drama of Faust the Gretchen action is only an episode, but it is developed with a spontaneity, a richness of delineation as regards the personality of Gretchen and her milieu, a depth of feeling, and a poignancy of</page><page sequence="16">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY tragic ruin that no sensitive reader is proof against. Thanks to Me- phisto, who engineers the seduction, many of the scenes sparkle with infinite vivacity and humor. As a matter of fact, Mephisto's initiative and resourcefulness make him more and more the star performer, eclipsing the hero, whose unresolved tensions, unfolding in new situa- tions but without major surprises, reduce him, dramatically speaking, to a more passive role. (This tendency, in fact, prevails throughout the greater portion of Part Two. Only at relatively brief intervals of special intensity does Faust come to the fore and take the lead. And it is only in the final act that Faust fully regains the undisputed summit of the dramatic protagonist.) The Gretchen action develops swiftly. In the space of a few days Faust, fluctuating between carnal desire and adoration, has won the love and unquestioning trust of the artless girl. From now on we lose track of the passage of time. It is idle to ask how many days Faust spends alone, in the tranquil retreat of Forest and Cavern, enveloped by Gretchen's hallowed aura, welling over with grateful prayers to the Earth Spirit, to whom Faust attributes the new turn of his life, feeling a sense of brotherly intimacy with the birds and beasts of the wilderness, lexploring the treasures of his own breast, and imagining himself in the company of the noblest spirits of bygone ages. It is idle to measure the degree of Gretchen's perturbation over her lover's disappearance by the calendar. Mephisto brings Faust out of the clouds back to the work in hand. When the lovers meet again, Faust is put on the defensive by Gretchen's insistent questions about his religious beliefs, showing her concern for his salvation, and by her undisguised aversion for his companion. Gretchen's plain speaking is one of her most endearing qualities. In the matter-of-factness of her approach she is prosy and unimaginative, quite unlike the sentimental "romantic" heroines com- monly met with in fiction. Faust is prompted to express his undogmatic pantheistic faith in exquisitely lyrical language, and Gretchen is half reassured. He is less successful in his embarrassed defense of Mephisto. The meeting ends with Gretchen's agreeing to doctor her mother's bedtime drink. When the curtain rises again, events have taken their inevitable course. At the well Gretchen becomes reflectively aware of the harsh condemnation her own social class metes out to any girl caught straying from the straight and narrow path, and the double standard 482</page><page sequence="17">GOETHE'S FAUST. AN INTRODUCTION (PART I) 483 that prevails regarding the man's part in the affair. Before the icon of the Virgin she bares her prostrated soul. The next thing, her brother, stung by the wagging of loose tongues, ambushes the strangers serenading the sister whose beauty and virtue he had idolized. He is killed, and his dying words strike the poor girl's heart with fiendish cruelty. The killers have fled, the idyl is over. Scattered hints, which no reader notices, show that all has taken place in one short month. Mephisto, accompanying Faust on his fatal tryst, alludes to the great adventure in store for them two nights later, the witches' sabbath on the eve of Saint Walpurga. The calendar date of this is fixed as the night ushering in the first of May. That night, as they trudge up the mountain, the Brocken, at the approach of midnight, Mephisto utters a couple of remarkably beautiful lines about the rising moon: Wie traurig steigt die unvollkommne Scheibe Des roten Monds mit spiiter Glut heran. (How dismally the imperfect disk of the red moon is ascending with its late glow.) The gibbous moon, rising late in the evening four or five nights after the full, places full moon about April 25th. This is the second spring full moon. It fixes the date of the first spring full moon as around March 25th. Inasmuch as Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first spring full moon, Easter must have been celebrated somewhere between March 26th and 31st. We know that the time that elapsed between Faust's frustrated attempt at suicide and his rejuvenation in the witch's kitchen amounted to no more than four days. (On the eve of Easter, his vision and suicide attempt; on Easter day, the afternoon walk followed by the exorcism of the poodle in the study; on Easter Monday, the wager and pact with Mephisto, followed by the visit to Auerbach's Wine Cellar; on the next day, their visit to the witch's kitchen.) This places Faust's ac- costing of Gretchen somewhere between the 29th of March and the 3rd of April. From that point on to the night of Valentin's murder, the 28th of April, the time stages of the developing love idyl are left vague. Before we return to Faust we get one more glimpse of Gretchen in an early stage of her long martyrdom. From the scene in the Cathedral we learn that her plight has infinitely worsened since her brother's death. Not only that the first stirrings of pregnancy fill her</page><page sequence="18">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY with forebodings, she bears a crushing burden of guilt on her mother's account, who faces a long period of purgatory, having died in her sleep (like Hamlet's father) without the ministrations of the Church. There can be no doubt about the circumstances: A precautionary over-dose of the sleeping potion must have proved fatal to her mother -this on the very night of Valentin's murder. Had it occurred earlier, the fact would have had to be brought out in the play, and Gretchen's overwrought conscience would have made a later tryst unthinkable. When are we to suppose the scene in the Cathedral to take place? As we know, the night of Walpurgis follows hard on the heels of Valentin's murder, only two days intervening. Perhaps the idea that we see Gretchen attending a requiem service for her mother and brother cannot be ruled out, but Gretchen's awareness of her preg- nancy makes the assumption of a later date more likely. If so, Goethe did wisely in sacrificing the chronological sequence to the continuity of mood of the Gretchen action. The nine months of anguish that under- mine her sanity are shrouded in obscurity. We see her for the last time in chains in a prison cell. Her mind is unhinged. She has done away with her baby. The executioner's sword awaits her at the dawn of day. After the Cathedral scene, a violent shift of mood and locale takes us to the witches' rendezvous on the Brocken with Faust and Mephisto as spectators and participants in the tumultuous annual convocation. This is a virtuoso performance of poetic genius. The language is strained to evoke a bewildering medley of eerie sound, light and movement in the surge of the demonic elemental forces. Faust and Mephisto, their way lighted by a will-o'-the-wisp, are caught in the tugging updraft and the crush of the flying hosts and detached individuals all straining to reach the summit for the cele- bration of the black mass. The modern theater, and particularly the film, finds a challenge in translating this feast of the imagination into a spectacle for the senses, but in accomplishing this it inevitably reduces the suggestive magic of the poetic word to a mere shadow. In the carnival of obscene animal energy we never get to see the climactic performance on the summit, presided over by "Herr Urian." Mephisto's caprice shunts Faust away from the upward surging throng into the quieter byways of a camping area. At this sideshow we meet a group of motley characters, oldsters, has-beens, who got bogged down in their flight because the vital spark failed them. These impo- 484</page><page sequence="19">GOETHE'S FAUST. AN INTRODUCTION (PART I) 485 tents expatiate nostalgically on the good old days when they called the tune, and Mephisto gleefully apes them. From general satire, directed against types, the focus disconcertingly shifts to personal satire: Goethe lampoons a literary enemy, Friedrich Nicolai, the old warhorse of the German Enlightenment. The many topical allusions were relished by contemporaries in the know but are pointless with- out a detailed commentary today. And what of Faust? He had felt the stiff climb among the knobby crags as a zestful challenge. To his inner eye the mountain- side had unveiled itself as a living matrix of treasure in the making. Eagerly looking forward to the main spectacle, he had been drawn off to a sideshow. He had danced with a young witch but lost appetite when a red mouse slipped out of her mouth. Then he had spied the wraith of a girl, and Mephisto's warning to avert his eyes from the "Gorgon" had only served to rivet his gaze on the wide-open dead eyes and the gliding gait of the apparition. More and more it had taken on the semblance of Gretchen, and a red line, no wider than the back of a knife, circling her throat, had loomed as a portent of her fate. There we leave Faust, to turn to the anticlimactic conclu- sion of the "Walpurgisnacht" scene, with some final jibes against half-baked plays and amateurish performances. Very abruptly the end of the Gretchen tragedy is now enacted. The discontinuity is extreme, as regards both the time and the form. The gap of nine months in Faust's life since his flight after Valentin's murder is a blank. Somehow Mephisto's magic must have succeeded in blocking Faust's memories of Gretchen and in stifling the voice of his conscience regarding her fate until the last night of her life. Then, learning what has happened to her and what awaits her, Faust breaks into violent recriminations against the satanic seducer, only to have his own guilt spelled out to him with pitiless matter-of-factness. The medium of this scene is prose-the rhetorical, exclamatory and at the same time long-winded prose of the "Storm and Stress" move- ment of the 1770's. Goethe left the scene "Bleak Day. Field." intact as a relic of his earliest work on the subject of Faust. The reference in the scene to the dog who amused himself during Faust's nightly strolls with playing practical jokes on harmless wanderers must belong to a phase of the composition before Goethe had hit upon the happy expedient of the exorcism scene as the means of introducing Mephisto to Faust.</page><page sequence="20">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Part One of Faust ends with the scene of the attempted rescue, an overwhelming finale. The personality of the wretched girl in the prison cell is completely shattered, but every fractured piece sug- gests the one-time perfection now irretrievably destroyed. In the wandering of her unhinged mind she bears a striking resemblance to Shakespeare's Ophelia, but with this difference: Ophelia, innocent victim of cruel fate, evokes a mood of pure pathos, while Gretchen, involved despite herself in fearful guilt, is a truly tragic victim. Physical dread and a desire to atone rend her bosom. Instinctively she senses the sinister aura of her one-time lover and shrinks from his touch. In a final flash of lucidity she throws herself upon the merciful judgment of God, and a voice from the Beyond proclaims her salvation. The Gretchen episode was the first stage of Faust's career in the world of man outside the confining walls of the study. For Faust, the pure love of Gretchen will be forever imbedded in his memory as the deepest spiritual blessing vouchsafed to him by a kindly Providence, and as the ineradicable reminder of his darkest hour. When he finally departs from the earthly stage the intercession of Gretchen will weight the scales in the achievement of his redemption.
