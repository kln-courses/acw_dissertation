Our mother began work on the book when she was about 85 and continued until her 97th year, during which time her eyesight became increasingly limited. The task of editing became, therefore, both very important and unbelievably difficult. The devoted work of the editors is what has made publication possible and we wish to acknowledge and express our deep appreciation to them. We also wish to thank the Institute of Classical Studies, and especially Professor J.P. Barron and Miss Alicia Totolos for having taken the initiative to involve the Accordia Research Centre when it became apparent that more time, energy and means were needed than the Institute of Classical Studies could provide for. It was hoped that this monograph could be published during our mother's lifetime, but that proved not to be attainable. We are convinced that she passed away knowing that her last work would be available to the archaeological community to which she devoted so much of her creative energy. Elizabeth K.

Between 1916 and 1920 she attended courses on various aspects of classical and modern literature and on the history of art, especially that of Greece and Rome, at various universities in Germany (Heidelberg, Berlin, Munich and Bonn). Her teachers included such distinguished scholars as Hiller von Gaertringen, Ferdinand Noack, Rudolf Pagenstecher, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Franz Winter and E. Wölfflin. Some ten years later she also attended courses at the University of Hamburg by Eugen von Mercklin on classical antiquity and Erwin Panowsky on Roman art. Already by the middle of the 1930s she had begun to publish on aspects of classical archaeology. During the 1950s she devoted some of her energies to pursuing her literary interests, writing on the work of Stefan George and Hölderlin, although she did not desert the field of classical art. Later, however, she turned exclusively to classical archaeology and for the rest of her life devoted herself with great enthusiasm to work in this field, in which her particular interest lay in the study of South Italian vases and their iconography. This may well have been due, at least in part, to the influence of Professor Lunsingh Scheurleer, whose lectures on classical archaeology she attended at the University of Leiden and to whose memory she dedicated the catalogue of the impressive collection of classical antiquities (Eine Niederländische Studiensammlung antiker Kunst = BABesch Suppl. 1, 1975) which she had been steadily building up and which has now passed to the University of Leiden. Four of the vases formerly in her collection are illustrated in the present work on Plates 35, 102, 104 and 146. From C.1960 onwards Mrs Schneider devoted most of her energies to publication in the field of South Italian vase-painting, as may be seen in the series of articles she regularly contributed to BABesch , one or more of which appeared almost every year between 1961 and 1982, when failing eyesight (resulting from a motor accident some years previously) and declining health began to slow down her productivity, though she persevered with her work until the very end. The articles well illustrate the range of her interests; many deal with various aspects of the iconography of South Italian vases and, in particular, the evidence they provide for the existence of an Eros cult in South Italy (e.g .BABesch 38, 1963; 43, 1968; 45, 1970; 48, 1973) or with the significance of certain objects which appear in the scenes depicted on the vases - e.g. the ball (BABesch 46, 1971), whipping-top (BABesch 48, 1973), xylophone (. Festoen , 1976; with addenda vsxBABesch 52-3, 1977-8). Other articles dealt in greater detail with some of the items in her own collection - in particular the Etruscan stamnos (AntK 13, 1970), and the two Apulian plates, showing female acrobats (Aparchai 1982); one of the last she wrote, in Enthousiasmos (Essays presented to J.M.Hemelrijk, 1986), dealt with some of the problems raised by the black-figured lekythoi of the so-called "Pagenstecher" class, of which she was hoping to make a fuller study.</page><page sequence="16">xx Foreword Her two major published works both deal with the origin and development of certain vase-shapes peculiar to South Italy. The first - Apulian Red-Figured Paterae with Flat or Knobbed Handles (. BICS , Suppl. 34, 1977) dealt in detail with the shape and decoration of the large dishes {paterae ) which play such a prominent part in Late Apulian and are frequently shown on the vases themselves. This was a masterly work which brought together for the first time most of the extant vases of this type with a well-chosen selection of plates to illustrate the varieties of shape and decoration. It was followed three years later by a survey of another interesting shape in Red-Figured Lucanian and Apulian Nestorides and their Ancestors (Allard Pierson Series, vol. 1, 1980). The so-called nestoris (or trozzella), which appears to be of native Messapian origin, is found in red-figure only in Lucanian and Apulian, and the excellent selection of illustrations provided in the book showed the varying forms which the nestoris might take, as well as the range of subjects represented upon them. It made a most valuable contribution to our better understanding of South Italian red-figure, and, in particular, to the connection between it and the native wares. In her later years Mrs Schneider also developed a growing interest in the Samnites, especially in the armour worn by their warriors and the costumes of the women. A preliminary article on this topic appeared in BABesch 57, 1982, and she was preparing a more detailed survey of the subject which her death in 1992 prevented her from completing. From those sections of the book which were already in something approaching their final form and from a mass of papers giving details about other aspects of the subject, Dr Edward Herring with painstaking attention has been able to reconstitute the work as a whole. It is fitting that the Accordia Research Centre and the Institute of Classical Studies are here collaborating to publish the result of this long labour. In this way, the extremely valuable corpus of material which Mrs Schneider had put together will not be lost to students in this field, who owe both the writer and her editor a deep debt of gratitude. The completed work will serve as a lasting memorial to Mrs Schneider-Herrmann, whose early training in philosophy, literature and philology lies behind that meticulous attention to detail which characterises her work. It is this careful application which gives to her work a deeper insight into the significance of the many religious, ritual and everyday scenes, which are so often depicted upon South Italian vases and which provide us with good illustrations of the relations between the Greek colonists and the native inhabitants of South Italy.

Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring, Book One, Chapter One) The above quotation is, in many respects, applicable to the manuscript of this book as it was first received by th e Accordio, Research Centre in December 1990. Clearly, it still required considerable attention before it could be published. However, Mrs Schneider-Herrmann's advancing age and failing eye-sight quite simply prevented her from completing certain of the remaining editorial tasks. Thus, it has fallen to me to polish the gold, as it were, in her stead. Accordio* s involvement with the book began at the instigation of Professor John Barron, the then Director of the Institute of Classical Studies. The manuscript had been submitted to the Institute, which had published one of the author's earlier monographs as a Bulletin Supplement in 1977 - Apulian Red-Figured Paterae with Flat or Knobbed Handles. Professor Barron was keen to proceed with the project, but realised that the Institute could not devote the staff time necessary to prepare the manuscript for final publication. Professor Barron invited Accordia , which as a young institution was in a better position to devote considerable staff time to this project, to undertake the task of preparing the manuscript for a joint imprint. Given the relevance of the book's subject matter to a research centre for early Italy, Accordia was only too happy to take up this invitation and to accept the book as an important addition to its Specialist Studies on Italy. Before moving on to outline the nature of my role in preparing the book as it is published here, I feel I should comment on the author's use of the term Samnite. The term is used broadly for the non-Greek population of Southwest Italy, and Campania in particular, in the 4th century BC. It is employed in much the same way that Osean has sometimes been used when applied to people as opposed to the language. (Trendall, for example, commonly uses the term Osean when referring to the non-Greeks portrayed on South Italian vases.) Needless to say, when dealing with iconographical evidence, one can never be absolutely certain that every non-Greek depicted on Campanian vases was strictly speaking a Samnite. However, the broad usage of the term is not inconsistent with scholarly convention. The armour in which many of the male figures on the vases are portrayed is commonly called Samnite (see, for example, the terminology in Saulnier's 1983 study L'Armée et la Guerre chez les peuples Samnites). While it is thought that the non- Greek population of the area was related ethnically to the Samnites, this is not the only name by which that population is identified. For example, the conquerors of Paestum in the late 5th century BC are called the Lucani. Other names used for the non-Greek population of the area include the Sabellians and the Oinotrians. It is unclear what the political status of these groups was or how exactly they were related to each other, and, indeed, it is not certain that the sources were entirely consistent in their application of a specific name to one particular group: some names may be general terms, others probably related to more tightly defined groups. In view of the problems associated with the use of these ethno-specific names, some authorities now prefer to use a much more generic term, such as natives, non-Greeks or, the Italian term, Indigeni, when speaking generally.</page><page sequence="18">xxii Editor's Preface This seems an appropriate point for me to indicate what I see as the value of the book. It draws together an impressive body of iconographical data, mainly from Campanian red- figure vase-painting, on the non-Greek or Samnite population of South Italy. This subject has not previously been covered at length in monograph form, although Professor Trendall published a well illustrated short survey on this topic, Gli Indigeni nella pittura italiota , in 1971. Although the book does not, and does not attempt to, provide a complete corpus of all the Campanian vases showing Samnites, it does offer a representative sample of the types of scenes in which the Samnites were portrayed. These data are complemented by a selection of carefully chosen tomb-paintings, which show Samnite warriors and women dressed in a similar way and performing similar tasks to those shown on the vase-paintings. (Since Mrs Schneider-Herrmann's death a major new study of Paestan tomb-painting has been published: Le tombe dipinte di Paestum by A. Pontrandolfo and A. Rouveret. Consideration of this material has not been incorporated into this book.) Archaeological excavation of actual examples of Samnite armour confirms that the iconographie record offers a true picture of Samnite society, at least in this respect. Moreover, the validity of the iconographie record can be further supported by occasional references to the Samnites in ancient authorities. From this evidence Mrs Schneider-Herrmann is able to discuss Samnite costume and armament in all its variety, and reconstruct plausibly at least some aspects of Samnite life. It seems to me particularly important to bring to the attention of a wider audience the breadth of this rich source of iconographical evidence for the nature of non-Greek society in the 4th century BC. It is my hope that the book will encourage scholars to make greater use of the iconographical evidence in the reconstruction of native society and, given that the vases were produced by the Greek colonists, use them as a basis for speculation on how the Greeks saw their neighbours. This is where the real value of this book lies and it should not be underestimated. Indeed, I would argue that there is a place for a companion volume on the depictions of the native population of South Italy on Apulian red-figure vases - a subject touched on only occasionally in this book. Apulian vase-painting is another a rich vein of evidence for non-Greek society and, for that matter, for relations between the Greeks and their neighbours. (The wealth of this source can only have increased with the recent publication of Trendall and Cambitoglou's Second Supplement to The Red-Figured Vases of Apulia.) Apulian vases, at times, show the native population in a way which is somewhat different from Campanian vases. The comparison between the portrayal of non-Greeks in the two fabrics is an interesting one, although it lies outside the scope of Mrs Schneider-Herrmann's study (see, however, APPENDIX, for some preliminary thoughts on this subject). I should like to turn now to my task as editor. My aim has been to complete the book in the way that the author herself would have done had she been able. My general policy has been to stay as faithful to the author's original manuscript as possible. For this reason I have not included any new material which has come to light since the author stopped work on the book. Thus, the book is, in some respects, a historical document dating to the author's last phase of work. The corollary of this decision is that the book does not take into consideration the most recent published scholarship. This is perhaps less serious in the discussion of the iconographical data which is in many respects a self-contained topic; although several new vases and paintings relevant to the Samnites have emerged since the author stopped work on the book. On the other hand, research into the historical and archaeological background to South Italy in the 4th century BC, and in particular the problems connected with identities of native groups and the relations between the Greeks and the neighbours, has moved on considerably in recent years. (Reasonably full and up-to- date bibliographies for individual Samnite sites may be found in Samnium. Archeologia del Molise by S. Capini and A. Di Niro (Rome 1991) and Abruzzo-Molise by F. Coarelli and A. La Regina (Bari 1984). On the historical side, it is more than twenty five years since E.T. Salmon's Samnium and the Samnites was published, there now exists a need for a modern synthesis to draw together the results of the latest research. The publication of Emma Dench's From Barbarians to New Men (Oxford 1995) should make an important contribution</page><page sequence="19">Editor's Preface xxiii to the historical study of the native peoples of the central Apennines, including the Samnites). However, to have taken all the most recent publications into consideration would have required the re-writing of parts of the book which would have altered its character in a fundamental way: in effect it would have become more my book than the author's. For the same reasons I have included the notes which were to have formed part of a general introduction to the book largely unaltered (cf. ORIGINAL NOTES BY G. SCHNEIDER-HERRMANN). It was not possible to construct a full and up-to-date introduction to the book from them without destroying the historical integrity of Mrs Schneider- Herrmann's work. Moving on to specific issues, one of my principal early tasks was to edit the English. I have tried to do this without altering the sense the author intended: similarly I have tried to retain the original emphasis whenever possible. It was necessary to check (and at times add to) the bibliographic references; many of the internal cross-references are also my additions. It was equally important to check the inventory numbers and attributions of vases, against the information present in the major vase corpora. In the original manuscript there was a mixture of in-text bibliographic references and references in footnotes. For consistency I decided to opt for the name/date style of bibliographic referencing, with the qualification that certain standard abbreviations are used when referring to major vase catalogues. I have retained the author's footnotes, as and when they are essential to the making of subsidiary points. I have also added a small number of editor's footnotes for the sake of clarity. The latter are clearly marked as such. The tripartite structure of the book represents my formalisation of the natural structure of Mrs Schneider-Herrmann's manuscript. The decision to place all the plates together at the end of the book was mine, as was that to put the figures in the text. I was also responsible for the compilation of the indexes. A more fundamental change was to move the discussion of MILITARY TRAINING (Ch. 3, 1) from the author's introductory notes ASPECTS OF Samnite LIFE to Chapter 3, The Samnite Warrior's Activities . The move better fits the structure I have imposed on the book. For the same reason I moved the section on 'single warriors without ritual attributions', which now appears in Chapter 3, 5, THE CULT OF THE SINGLE WARRIOR, from the ASPECTS OF SAMNITE Life section. The vases bearing scenes of individual warriors in non-ritual situations seem to me to belong better in their new position which allows them to be usefully compared with generically similar vases showing the ritual activities performed by individual warriors. In the original manuscript THE CÜLT OF THE SINGLE WARRIOR came between the PREPARING FOR COMBAT and COMBAT sections. I believe its present position as the last section in Chapter 3, The Samnite Warrior's Activities , allows a much more coherent progression through the combat-related activities and then on to the warrior's ritual activities. The formalisation of the structure of the book has also required the composition of a number of linking passages between sections. These merely serve to improve the continuity of argument through the book. One of the most significant and complicated tasks I have had, was the construction of two of the major sections of text from Mrs Schneider-Herrmann's notes. The two sections in question were THE SAMNITE TUNIC (Ch. 1, 2) and THE SAMNITE WOMAN'S DOMESTIC ACTIVITIES (Ch. 5, 2). Although both sections were listed in the original contents sheet, neither was present in the manuscript as I first received it. Indeed, it was not until after Mrs Schneider-Herrmann's death, when her family sent me a large quantity of her papers, that I found various pages of notes from which I was then able to reconstruct the missing sections. I believe that these sections, while not totally in the author's own words, represent the spirit of what she wished to say on these subjects. In my view, the book would have been significantly impoverished by their absence. This is perhaps the point to comment on the seeming imbalance in the amount of the book devoted to men compared with the amount devoted to women. While this is in part a quirk of the manuscript, it is more a reflection of the nature of the iconographie record. On</page><page sequence="20">xxiv Editor's Preface the first point one cannot fail to notice that there is a lengthier discussion of the male costume compared with the female. Partly this results from discussing the broad belt and footwear, which were also worn by women, in that part of the book devoted to the male costume. It would have been repetitious to revisit the discussion of these items of clothing when the female costume is discussed later on. In the main, however, it is the nature of the record which creates more of this apparent imbalance. The warriors have a great deal of armour and military equipment which warrants lengthy discussion whereas the women lack anything which one could described as a counterpart. Similarly, the warriors are shown in a greater variety of single-sex activities than women are. The majority of these are related to combat and this seems to have been a topic of some interest to vase-painters. By contrast women's domestic activities are but seldom depicted. The ritual activities of women seems to have been of greater interest to vase-painters, although most of these activities, in fact, involve both sexes. Indeed, even in the libation scenes, a rich source for the depiction of Samnite women, the main focus is the warrior whose departure or return is being honoured. It is perhaps a reflection of society that the vase-painters and/or their clients were more concerned to record the activities of warriors than those of women Another point to note is that the section on THE SAMNITE WOMAN'S COSTUME (Chapter 4, 2) is close in content to part of the author's 1982 article 'The Osean woman on Campanian red-figured vases and her costume' (Bulletin Antieke Beschaving , 57: 147-152). One may safely assume that she had not significantly altered her thinking on this subject between the publication of the article and the composition of this book. (For a further discussion on the depiction of native women, cf. M. Dewailly, 'Les femmes des guerriers indigènes', Mélanges de l'École Française de Rome , Antiquité , 94: 581-623). Having outlined the ways in which I have altered the manuscript, I feel it is important to re-emphasise that this remains Mrs Schneider-Herrmann's book. The choice of material is hers, the opinions expressed in it are hers. All I have done is, I hope, to ensure that the published book will be useful to the scholarly world and that Mrs Schneider-Herrmann's final work upholds the standards she maintained in her earlier publications. It remains for me as editor to thank various individuals and organisations that have helped me in my task. Professor John Barron was the prime mover in setting up the collaboration between the Institute of Classical Studies and Accordia. His successor as Director of the Institute of Classical Studies, Professor Richard Sorabji, has been just as staunch in his support of this enterprise. Alicia Totolos and Margaret Packer have always been willing to advance the project in any way they could. Even after her retirement Alicia has continued to follow the progress of the book with her customary enthusiasm. Cleone Weaver also gave practical and logistic help. The library research in checking the bibliographic references was mainly conducted in The Joint Library of The Hellenic and Roman Societies and in the library of the British School at Rome. I am extremely grateful to these institutions and their staff. I should also like to thank Dr Michael Edwards and Dr Kathryn Lomas for helping to illuminate certain points concerning the historical background to the book. My two closest colleagues in the Accordia Research Centre , Dr Ruth Whitehouse and the Director, Dr John Wilkins, have been a constant source of encouragement and advice during the time I have spent working on this book. Both proof-read the final draft of the book prior to publication, and it has been much improved as a result of their labours. The project has taken considerably longer than anyone had originally envisaged. I am grateful to everyone involved with the publications schedules of the Institute of Classical Studies and of the Accordia Research Centre for bearing with me. I owe a particular debt of gratitude to Professor A.D. Trendall. Just weeks before this volume was finally consigned to the printers Professor Trendall sadly passed away. It was he who alerted me to the changed locations of a number of vases referred to in the book and made a number of important suggestions which have improved the clarity of the final text. It was an enormous boon to be able to call upon his unsurpassed knowledge of South Italian red-figure vase-painting. Others will write fuller and more eloquent tributes. Dale Trendall</page><page sequence="21">Editor's Preface xxv showed a rare generosity towards his younger colleagues. He was happy to read the whole of this work and his detailed comments displayed his characteristic erudition. For my part, I shall remember him for his warmth and unfailing encouragement. My greatest thanks, however, must be reserved for the family of Mrs Schneider- Herrmann, particularly her daughters: Elizabeth K. Gomperts-Schneider, Gidi I. Croes- Schneider and Dorris U. Kuyken-Schneider. It was originally hoped that the book could be published during the author's life-time. It is a source of great regret to me that this did not prove feasible. Despite the family's disappointment that this aim could not be achieved, their generous support did not fail. I thank them for their understanding of the complexities of my job as editor, but, most of all, I thank them for their patience. I used the quotation at the start of this preface to illustrate the condition of Mrs Schneider-Herrmann's manuscript as I first saw it. It is my hope that the following quotation is applicable to my editing of her work. "This mean and unrefined stuff of mine, Will make your glistering gold but more to shine."

Trendall of La Trobe University, Victoria, who first suggested a study of the Samnites to me. I owe him a particular debt of gratitude. I wish to thank Dr Douwe Yntema of the 'Vrije Universiteiť of Amsterdam, whose particular interest lies in South Italian vase painting of the 7th and 6th centuries BG, for his advice on publications about the 4th century BC. The drawings, taken from reproductions, are by Dorris U. Kuyken-Schneider, curator at the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam. They show details of the various vase paintings in a clearer way than can be seen in the photographic reproductions. General Among the large number of South Italian tribes, the Samnites are known by name because they were one of the few which played an important role in the local history, notably in Campania. Recently scholarly interest has become more specifically focussed on particular subjects. Recent research on Greek culture and art is more in contact with the history and art of other major ancient populations than ever before. The main vessels from which representations of Samnites can be studied come from Apulia and Campania, and were made under Attic influence in the 4th century BC. In studying the Campanian and Apulian Samnites, one has to sort out the large numbers of vase paintings and arrange the data into groups showing the events and activities with which the Samnites were involved. Apart from this one must also study the ancient literary and historical scources. This is easier than it has been in the past because, for the most part, the Greek and Latin texts have been translated into modern languages. New interpretations of long established dates ascribed to certain events, such as the founding of cities, have forced scholars to reopen the discussion about them. I have tried to produce a monograph on the 4th century representations of Samnites, after having organised the subject matter according to iconographically appointed groups. The representations come from vases which have been recovered from a number of places. Oscans and Samnites The non-Greeks, also called the native, local or Italic peoples, represented on Campanian red-figure vases and tomb paintings of the 4th century BC are generally regarded as representatives of the Osean tribes. They are clearly distinguished from the Greek 1 This is a mixed section of notes which were intended to form part of a general introduction to the book. It was impossible to bring them up to date without altering the author's original intention and historical interpretation fundamentally.

E.H.</page><page sequence="23">xxviii Author's Notes Fig. 1 Map of Southern Italy showing some of the major sites in Campania and major Greek colonies colonists (Italiotes). It is, however, not unlikely that these pictures show the Samnites who, at that time, lived in the Italiote cities of Capua, Cumae and Nola alongside the colonial Greeks. Since the amount of published research on the native history of South Italy has increased considerably recently (see, for example, Heurgon 1942; Pugliese Carratelli 1972; Salmon 1967; Holloway 1970; Frederiksen 1979; Arias 1980), it seems appropriate to try to give a short account of the historical background of the Oscans who were one of the powerful tribes who invaded Campania in prehistoric times in order to settle in the fertile lands there. It is, nevertheless, difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct a coherent flow of events and facts, because native history occurred 'fuori della dinamica storica' (that is separate from Greek, Etruscan and Roman history) and was not, therefore, the main subject of ancient writers; thus literary evidence is relatively scarce (Pugliese Carratelli 1972: 37). The narratives which do survive are not always reliable, especially in terms of chronology, and this results in doubts being raised in the minds of scholars. The most securely dated evidence is provided by a number of Etruscan inscriptions. The years between 650 and 450 BC are seen as the period of the Etruscan hegemony over Campania. During this period the Greeks lived in Capua, Nola and Cumae alongside Oscans and Samnites, all of whom were Etruscan subjects (Frederiksen 1979: 295; 305). Before we deal with the historical background of the Oscans, some specific points should be made regarding their name and their relationship to other native tribes.

The subject may be reduced to its simplest form as follows: the Oscans were also known as Opici, Osci, and Ausonians. Relationships are assumed to have existed between the Osci and the Samnites as well as between the Samnites and the Sabellians. The Greeks seem to have called Campanian Italic group, consisting of various elements, 'Opici' and 'Ausonians'. The word 'Opici' is said to have been transformed by the Greeks into 'Osci' (Oscans), and that name is supposed to have been applied to both the Osci and Ausonians (Heurgon 1942: 39-42; 46-52; Salmon 1967: 29; Frederiksen 1979: 306). The Osci are related to the Samnites by migration and by language group (Salmon 1967: 28-35; Frederiksen 1979: 306). The Samnites spoke the Osean language and belonged to the large group of 'Osean speakers', who first become evident in the 6th century BC (Heurgon 1942: 98; Salmon 1967: 28-35; Frederiksen 1979: 306). By descent the Samnites seem to be related to the Sabellians, indeed they may even have been the same tribe (Salmon 1967: 30; 35). All of these groups are linked together by history; this is particularly true of the Oscans and the Samnites. Some historical remarks The 'Opici', as the Oscans were at that time known, are thought to have come down from the Umbrian mountains, to occupy the territory of Samnium during prehistory (Heurgon 1942: 44; Salmon 1967: 30-35) (fig. 1). Whether the region was at that time inhabited by an aboriginal population, sometimes referred to as 'Mediterraneans', is unknown (Salmon 1967: 29; 34-5; 39-40). The possibility of the existence of a pre-Oscan population in Campania, is equally a matter of conjecture, at least given the present state of research (Frederiksen 1979: 306). After the Oscans came the Samnites, who conquered Samnium taking their name from the territory (Salmon 1967: 29-30). The Oscans partly migrated west and southwards, although they are also said to have mingled with the Samnites. At what time the Samnites started to expand in the same direction is uncertain. During this phase the two tribes fought each other almost constantly. That the Opici-Ausonians and the Greeks inhabited Campania before the Etruscans seems to be attested by the literary sources (Frederiksen 1979: 295). The major expansion of the Etruscans into Campania is said to have occurred in the 7th century, at around 650 BC (Frederiksen 1979: 295-305). The chronological data for South Italy become more reliable for the course of the 5th century BC. During this period the Oscans or Oscan-speakers are thought to have taken over Lucania (Salmon 1967: 34-5). According to archaeological evidence, they occupied Satrianum around the middle of the century, having come down from the Apennines, in the same way as they had done earlier (Holloway 1970). In the years that followed they continued to expand and 'Oscanised' Lucania was attacked and occupied by Samnites from Samnium in about 435 BC (Salmon 1967: 37-8). Intertribal warfare and migration spread over the west and south of Campania. Oscans and Samnites went on to reach the 'toe' of the peninsula, which was inhabited by a mixed race of people at the time. The Italiote cities of Suessula, Capua, Nola and Cumae, which were then under Etruscan control, became home to an increasing number of Oscans and Samnites. Concerning the much discussed possible foundation date of 471 BC for the Etruscan settlement at Capua, scholarly opinion at present is inclined to assume that Capua was, in fact, much older. The ancient literary tradition concerning 471 BC might rather mark a replanning and extension of the city (Heurgon 1942: 62-65; Salmon 1967: 38; Frederiksen 1979: 295; 303). Some of the previously mentioned Etruscan inscriptions which contain some Osean words and names come from Capua and Suessula (Heurgon 1942: 98; Frederiksen 1979: 302-3; 306). Some can be dated to c.500 BC and these allow some tentative statements to be made about the otherwise unknown nature of community life in these cities and the</page><page sequence="25">xxx Author's Notes relations between the Etruscans and their Osean subjects. That these inscriptions are sometimes applied to Attic pottery also provides a sign of the interaction between the Oscans and the Greeks. The following is a list of Etruscan inscriptions dated to the early 5th century BC which contain Osean names: 1) from Capua a) on an Attic cup (Yale 442) (Beazley 1945: 156) b) on a bronze stamnos (St Petersburg, V-591) (Kharsekin 1958: 267-69) c) on a heavy bucchero kantharos (Sgobbo 1956: 49) 2) from Suessula a) on an Attic stemless cup (Spinelli coll.) (Baffioni 1974: 309, no. 292; Vetter 1939: 169, no. 29). However, the longest native text comes from Capua (now in Berlin) and is inscribed on a tile (Pallottino 1954: 19-21). It is dated to the middle of the 5th century BC and can be seen as a ceremonial text, probably of funerary character. It contains names and words which, though not Osean, are most likely to be of another Italic language (Frederiksen 1979: 303). From the late 6th century onwards, the strength of the Campanian tribes grew as Etruscan power declined. The Campanian tribes organised themselves into the 'Nation of the Campani' or 'Samnite League' in 438 BC, with the Samnites as the most powerful member (Heurgon 1942: 82; 88; Salmon 1967: 41-8; Frederiksen 1979: 306). In the years 525 and 474/3 BC the Etruscans were twice defeated; the second occasion being the naval assault which was defeated at the battle of Cumae. The end of the Etruscan hegemony over Campania was brought about by a number of decisive events which are dated between 450 and 400 BC (Frederiksen 1979: 305-8). The Samnites occupied Capua in 425 BC, Nola in 423 BC and Cumae in 421 BC (Heurgon 1942: 82; 87; Salmon 1967: 38-9). The large contingent of Greek inhabitants of Cumae sought refuge in Neapolis (Pugliese Carratelli 1972: 39). The actual end of Etruscan rule over Campania is said to have come in 423 BC. It was brought about by a Campanian assault near Capua, but treachery is thought to have played a part in their final defeat, as the Etruscan leaders are said to have been drunk following a religious festival. From that time on Campania came under Samnite control. Osean can be supposed to have been the main language spoken by the mixed population, often referred to as the 'Osean Speakers'. Regarding the survival of the Etruscans in the area, the evidence points to Pontecagnano and Paestum in particular as important centres for the remaining Etruscan inhabitants of the area (Frederiksen 1979: 307). The most recent Etruscan inscription comes from Pontecagnano and is dated to the 4th century BC. Bucchero pottery, some of it of the heavy variety, has been found during excavations; it is also depicted on tomb-paintings of the same period2. Over time the various populations of the area, Campanian, Etruscan and Greek, seem to have become increasingly mixed with strong Greek influences being especially evident (see Frederiksen 1979: 297-8 for Greek influences in the early period; Frederiksen 1979: 305-7 for the 4th century BC and Pugliese Carratelli 1972: 38; 42). According to recent research the decline of Samnite power accelerated as a result of Roman expansion after 338 BC. Capua and other cities gradually lost their freedom, initially as a result of succumbing to the powerful influences pressing from outside. The Campanian cavalry, consisting of Samnites and Oscans, which was founded in the 5th century is said to have had a high reputation. It still existed in the 4th century and later served as a mercenary force for the Greeks and others; for example for the Carthaginians in Sicily (Heurgon 1942: 425; Salmon 1967: 101-112; Frederiksen 1968: 2 v. example from Capua in Weege 1909: 110, no. 19 which shows a libation scene in which the right hand woman offers a bucchero cup to the left hand woman, who in turn is holding a bucchero oinochoe. Both vessels are described as being incised with palmettes. For a Paestan example v. Weege 1909: 116, no. 30 where a woman offers a foot soldier a bucchero cup.</page><page sequence="26">Author's Notes xxxi 3-31; Frederiksen 1979: 307). After 216 BC Capua seems to have been completely subordinate to the Romans. To return to the problem of the nationality of the non-Greeks represented on Campanian vases and tomb-paintings, there is certain closely linked literary and archaeological evidence to convince us that it must the Samnites who were being portrayed. For example, we see both the warrior equipped in full panoply and his wife dressed in her extravagantly fashioned local costume as citizens of important social standing in the cities of Campania. Aspects of Samnite Life The style in which non-Greeks are represented on South Italian red-figure vases does not differ from that in which the Greeks are rendered; nor are the non-Greeks distinguished by racial characteristics. It is the native costumes by which they can be recognised. Campanian vase-paintings are particularly helpful in casting light upon the non-Greek way of life. Numerous examples furnish us with different aspects of non-Greek life from which a coherent image emerges of the warrior and his wife. It is a man's world, a warrior's world. Warriors The Samnite cavalry had a high reputation from 425 BC which endured into the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. The Samnite infantry was feared by the Romans for some time. On Campanian vases, native men are depicted as warriors and are normally depicted with some armament to go with their distinctive costume. As warriors they can be either cavalrymen or foot soldiers. On Apulian vases, on the other hand, native men are shown in a greater variety of situations and they seem, on the whole, to be depicted in a less warlike manner, at least some of the time. However, it is the Campanian vases which are our main concern here, and combat and related activities are certainly well represented in the iconographie record. Moreover, while ritual scenes involving men are commonplace, there is still frequently a military overtone. For example, we have a number of libation scenes where a Samnite woman pours a drink in honour of her husband who is shown either on the point of departure for battle or on his return from battle, cf. Ch. 6, 3. Similarly, we have ritual scenes, were a woman presents a young warrior with a piece of equipment he had not previously owned. Once again, it seems that even in the religious sphere Samnite life was dominated by militarism. In terms of combat, itself, it seems that conflict between individuals is favoured over large scale battles as a subject for vase-painting. This is presumably more a matter of artistic convention than the realities of battle at the time, cf. Ch. 3, 3. Some of these scenes show the capture of prisoners. These give a flavour of the tensions which existed between the native and colonial Greek population, and also between different native groups. There are also scenes which show a more comic, or even theatrical, form of combat. These are discussed at length in Ch. 3, 4. There are also occasional scenes of lone warriors in combat poses and pictures of warriors preparing for battle, although this must have been a more time-consuming activity than the number of vase-paintings depicting it suggest. Even given a conflict dominated society, where the male social élite was a warrior class, it must nevertheless have been true that Samnite men had other activities which did not involve conflict. These are only occasionally glimpsed. We see men involved in rituals connected with marriage and with honouring the dead but even here the men are normally armed (cf. Ch. 6, 2 and Ch. 6, 4). Tomb-paintings broaden our picture slightly by showing men hunting and racing chariots, but even these are violent pursuits.</page><page sequence="27">xxxii Author's Notes Such is the nature of their society, as it is depicted, than even the young do not escape this warrior society. As far as we know there is a rather limited number of representations of unarmed youths, as, for example: Skyphos, Boston, 03.822. Plate 1. An unarmed adolescent is shown wearing a loin-cloth, a chaplet on his head, and soft white shoes on his feet. Errera Painter. LCS (2/718), p. 323, (no ill.); Beazley 1943: 83, no. 4, pl. VI.

It seems that boys were educated in the art of warfare at an early age (cf. Ch. 3,1). Horse riding was important in Samnite life and it seems it was a skill acquired at a young age. Skyphos, Leiden, GNV 8. Plate 2. The scene shows a young boy in a simple white tunic riding a horse which is seemingly too large for him. Frignano Group. LCS (3/239), p. 392, pis 151.3-4. Photograph courtesy of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, Leiden. Like many tribes the Samnites were known for rearing horses, and the fertile plains of Campania would have been most suitable for this. They are said to have bred small horses and to have treated them well. On this latter point there certain images which provide information to support this view. For example, there are two by the LNO Painter. Hydria, Budapest T 763. Plate 3. A youth stands unafraid close to his father's horse. He has put his hand on one of its forelegs.

Ch. 6, 3, no. Ile. All these scenes suggest that Samnite men were required to be warriors, and that status went with military prowess. To judge from the iconographie record, their adult lives were dominated by warfare and related activities while from a young age they learned to acquire the skills necessary to join this warrior society. Samnite women The life of the Samnite woman, as it is depicted on Campanian red-figure vases, was altogether more peaceful. In general, the Samnite woman is less frequently portrayed than her male counterpart. Moreover, she is often more difficult to recognise. This is because for daily life Greek dress, with some native accoutrements (such as a broad belt), was preferred to the full, highly elaborate native costume. The latter was reserved for certain ceremonial or ritual occasions (cf. Ch. 4). We may assume that the women shown on the red-figure vases came from the same social class as the Samnite warriors. Indeed, we have some scenes which may be interpreted as marriage ceremonies (cf. Ch. 6, 2). We may therefore conclude that the</page><page sequence="28">Author's Notes xxxiii women belonged to the wealthier social groups. This is supported by the splendour of their full costume and by the fact that they are sometimes accompanied by a servant (v. Ch. 6, 3, no. Ha). Although the women belonged to the same social class as the warriors, their lifestyle was very different. Scenes of their everyday life are relatively rare. The working of wool was obviously an important activity for Samnite women. Not only are there occasional scenes showing women involved in spinning but their elaborately patterned costumes, and indeed those of their husbands, provide corroborative evidence for their skill (cf. Ch. 4 and Ch. 5, 2). The portrayal of women involved in this kind of domestic activity is perhaps highly predictable. More unusual are some scenes depicting women acting as a kind of paidagogos, in teaching young girls the skills of mime-dancing (cf. Ch. 5, 2). The roles of wife and mother must have played an important part in the lives of Samnite women. However, the iconographie record offers us only occasional glimpses of women in these capacities. In the libation scene on the hydria (Budapest T 763) described above (plate 3) we see a woman, together with her young son, welcoming back her husband from battle. This scene gives us a rare view of Samnite family relationships. One of the most interesting aspects of the lives of Samnite women is their ritual activities. It is evident that they took a full part in the religious and ceremonial life of the community. Although most of the rituals they perform are in honour of men, such as presenting warriors with a new piece of equipment, performing libations in honour of departing or returning warriors, or making votive offerings in honour of a dead warrior (see, for example, Ch. 6, 3 and Ch. 6, 4). In all these rituals their role, while necessary, is subservient to that of the men. They appear on a more equal footing in marriage and pré- nuptial ceremonies, where both bride and groom are together the centre of attention (cf. Ch. 6, 2). There are some scenes where individuals or groups of women perform rituals on their own. In these scenes attention is exclusively focussed on women's activities. There are two types of cult scene which are exclusively female. One involves a group of women honouring a central woman with votives. The second is a cult devoted to the god Eros. Here women either offer votives to an Eros figure or are shown together with the god (cf. Ch. 5, 4). Eros seems to have been a popular deity for attracting cult attention from the native population as well as from the colonial Greeks. Indeed, it seems that the Samnites had their own image of the god, as their Eros is more effeminate than the normal Greek depictions. The other rituals in which women could sometimes be the centre of attention are funerary ones, when the deceased is a woman (cf. Ch. 6, 4). In general, however, women are normally shown dutifully honouring men with their ritual ceremonies. It is the warriors who command the women's attention. It is they who have the real power and status in society.</page><page sequence="29">The Samnite Warrior</page><page sequence="30">Chapter 1 The Samnite Warrior's Appearance 1 Introduction Today the main surviving source of information for the Samnite warrior's equipment is Campanian vase-painting because the Capuan tomb-paintings were almost completely destroyed during the Second World War. However, we do have F. Weege's extensive descriptions of how these paintings looked in the early part of this century (Weege 1909: 99-141, figs 1-5, pis 8-12; v. also Heurgon 1942: 421-39). There are also some photographs of these tombs as well as a number of sketches of other tomb-paintings which had already disintegrated prior to the war. The scanty fragments which remain today have been thoroughly studied by Luigia Mandato lā In broad terms, all the representations show the same type of warrior dressed in the same costume and bearing the same equipment. Obviously, the images are less colourful on red-figure vases than in the frescos on the walls of tombs or the paintings on sarcophagi. This equally applies to a series of Paestan tomb-paintings which are for the most part far better preserved than their Capuan counterparts (Weege 1909: figs 6-1 1; Sestieri 1956-57: 65-1 10; Napoli 1970a: 21, figs 9 &amp; 10; 58, fig. 92; 59, fig. 93; 60, figs 94 &amp; 96; 62, fig. 101; 63, figs 102 &amp; 103; Termer 1978: 103, no. 78). Because the stylistic development and the relative chronology of the tomb paintings has yet to be fully researched2 it seems advisable to study them in the light of the comparison with red-figure vases. A.D. Trendall, in his 1936 study Paestan Pottery , made just such a comparison between the famous Paestan tomb-painting, known as the 'Procession fresco' (plate 5) and a Paestan oinochoe now in the Louvre (K 718). The vase is ascribed to the Boston Orestes Painter and is dated to the last decade of the 4th century BC (PP, p. 82-3, pis XXXIb &amp; XXXIc; v. also Weege 1909: 1 16 where the tomb painting is dated to late in the 5th or early in the 4th century BC. v. also Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: pl. 267; and here cf. Ch. 2, 1 and Ch. 2, 3). Although the tomb-paintings are grand in scale they are an art form which is related to vase painting. The date of the latter may be considered broadly appropriate for the former. Furthermore, it is worth noting that Greek and Roman writers make reference to the equipment used by the Samnites (e.g. Livy IX, 40; Strabo 6.1.2: v. also Weege 1909: 141-158 for a full account of literary references to Samnite military equipment; also 1 Luigia Mandato, Pittura Campana antica , Università di Bari, Faccoltà di Lettere e Filosofia (1962/63). I wish to thank Prof. S. Garofano Venosta of Capua for his kindness in sending me a copy of Dr L. Mandato's study. 2 Since the author's death a lavishly illustrated, major study of Paestan tomb-painting has appeared - Le tombe dipinte di Paestum by A. Pontrandolfo and A. Rouveret. The author's text has not been altered to take this book into consideration. E.H.</page><page sequence="31">4 Chapter 1 Salmon 1967: 101 which discusses a passage in Diodorus Siculus 23.2 which may refer to the Samnites). Samnites are said to have worn plain white and coloured tunics, together with shiny crested helmets, during the Samnite Wars (fought against the Romans in 310 BC and 285 BC). The Roman troops are said to have been intimidated by the appearance of the Samnites and the consul Papirus needed to calm his soldiers down (Weege 1909: 154). 2 The Samnite Tunic Introduction Representations of Samnite warriors wearing tunics occur on the earliest Italiote vase paintings. As far as we know, it is a Lucanian who is portrayed by the Amykos Painter in c.430/420 BC on a Lucanian Type I nestoris (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 1971.49), wearing the simplest kind of tunic (plate 6; v. LCS Suppl. II, (137b), p. 156, pl. XXX.l; Indigeni , p. 13, pl. 1-2; Schneider-Herrmann 1980: fig. 43; cf. here Ch. 2, 1 and Ch. 2, 6). The next representation of a Samnite dressed in a tunic is dated to the end of the 5th century BC and ascribed to the Sisyphus Painter who worked in the Apulian red-figure style. This warrior's tunic has a more complicated shape (column krater (BM F 174) (plate 7); RVAp I (1/55), p. 16, (no ill.); Indigeni , p. 14, pl. 12. Much later, around 350/40 BC, the Campanian red-figure exponents, the Astarita and Libation Painters, and their associates, produced a number of images of Samnite warriors wearing a variety of different types of tunic, all of which bear some relation to the Apulian example cited above (i.e. that shown in plate 6) (for an example by the Astarita Painter v. the neck amphora (Vatican Astarita collection, 58) (plate 8) (LCS, (3/269). p. 400, pl. 1 55 A; Indigeni, p. 17, pl. 44; cf. here Ch. 2, 1 and Ch. 4, 2) and the hydria by the Libation Painter (Paris, Louvre K 277) (plate 9) (LCS (3/301) p. 406 pl. 160.1; Indigeni, p. 18, pl. 51; cf. here Ch. 4, 2. v. Ch. 6, 3, no. Ic). It seems that the Lucanian, Apulian and Campanian tunics were all basically related to one another. It was a short garment with short sleeves and a rounded neckline. It could have a straight, rounded or pointed lower border. A broad belt with a buckle at the front was worn around the waist thus enhancing the appearance of the tunic. Moreover, there are a few paintings which show a tunic hanging as a trophy on the spear of a victorious warrior. Another image of a tunic, this time spread out to form a rectangle, comes from a Capuan tomb-painting (plate 10: v. Ch. 6, 4, no. IVc) (Weege 1909: 104-5, no. 7, pl. 9.1). The tomb-paintings and vases provide us with images of Samnites wearing white, coloured and striped tunics; it is unlikely that the literary record could have furnished a more vivid picture of Samnite warriors of the 4th century BC. What the literary sources do tell us is that the Samnite army was well organised and composed of hoplites and cavalry (the so-called 'Cavalry Campana') (for references to the Samnite army v. Wuilleumier 1939: 668-70; Salmon 1967: 101-112; Salmon 1978: 49 refers to the équités Campani ; Frederiksen 1968 deals particularly with the Campanian cavalry, v. especially page 14). The pictorial record suggests that mounted warriors were more elaborately equipped, but the foot soldier could also wear a patterned tunic and a feathered helmet; v. the bail amphora (Melbourne, La Trobe University, 94.02) (plate 11) attributed to the Three-Dot Group (LCS Suppl. II (2/357a), p. 196, pl. XXXI.3) (v. Ch. 3, 3, no. Ie). What the Roman authors said about Samnite helmets, shields and belts being made of gold and silver no longer seems as improbable as it once did, because gilded Samnite belts have been recovered from excavations at Capua and the surrounding area (Weege 1909: 154; Salmon 1967: 102; cf. here Ch.l, 4). Some of the richly coloured frescos show some parts of the armour in gold. This not only enhances the images of Samnite warriors and</page><page sequence="32">The Samnite Warrior's Appearance 5 women but also tends to support the evidence of the literary record. On the other hand, Strabo notes that during this period the appearance of the Samnites lost its individuality as well as other characteristics (Weege 1909: 141; Strabo 6.1.2). According to ancient tradition the tunic would have been made from one piece of cloth. The previously cited Capuan tomb-painting showing a tunic hanging as a trophy from a spear (plate 10), may be assumed to show the basic form of the garment. Other iconographical sources such as those cited provide us with evidence for how the tunic was worn. The broad belt worn by Samnite warriors would have kept the material together at the waist. The wearer would have had the freedom to gather the material around the waist and hips thus producing either a close or loose fitting garment according to personal taste. The material below the belt seems to have been arranged into a type of loin-cloth. Below the belt, the back of the garment can be closed or open, the latter presumably to allow greater freedom of movement. An example of a similar type of one piece garment from the mediaeval period can be seen in plate 12, photograph courtesy of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, Leiden. This is a child's garment probably originally from Egypt, cf. also the Catalogue of the 1986 exhibition at the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, Leiden, Schatten uit Turkije , nos 328-353, various garments all of mediaeval date.

Comparison with tunics worn by other Samnite groups In considerating the tunics worn by Campanian Samnites one should also bear in mind those worn by their Lucanian, Apulian and Paestan neighbours. In fact, the depictions of the tunics worn by all the native groups resemble each other quite closely. In each group we encounter examples of the plain tunic with loose folds, the more close fitting type, and the decorated type. It is this latter group which shows greatest variation; this shows up in the patterning.

This combination has a long tradition preserved in iconographical representations which goes back most notably to Hittite art of the second millennium BC. These Hittite representations take the form of large stone reliefs and bronze statuettes showing figures wearing a tunic or loin-cloth and a broad belt. Dated to the 14th century BC is a large relief from the royal port of Hattusas which shows the war god wearing a loin-cloth and broad belt (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: figs 64-5). At the front the garment is open and one piece of material overlaps the other; this is indicated by the diagonal edge and ornamental border of the cloth. The sculpting of the belt is particularly skilful suggesting the flexible material from which a real belt would have been made. Fig. 12 Hittite bird-headed demon wearing the tunic and belt costume (after Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: fig. 109) Similarly, we can observe the short sleeved tunic and accompanying broad belt, shown in frontal view, as worn by two winged, bird-headed demons with raised arms (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: fig. 1 1 1). Dated between 1050 and 850 BC is a representation of a kneeling bird-headed demon, shown in three-quarter view, wearing a tunic and broad belt (fig. 12) (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: fig. 109). The tunic is particularly relevant to our study. Tunics of similar form appear several times in Hittite art and were still occurring around 700 BC (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: figs 113, 127 and especially 146 which is dated to 700 BC). This last point is particularly significant in that it was in this period that the Greeks are supposed to have begun trade and colonial contacts with the Middle East. Whether or not the tunic or loin-cloth was generally worn by the Hittite population is beside the point, the Greeks clearly adopted it. The first representation of Greeks wearing such garments comes on the paintings of komasts on Corinthian aryballoi from the early 7th century BC (Seeberg 1971). The 6th century vases sometimes show gods and</page><page sequence="40">The Samnite Warrior's Appearance 13 characters from mythology wearing this type of costume but mostly it is human figures such as komasts, actors, flute players and warriors that are shown wearing the tight fitting, Hittite-style short tunic with short sleeves and a broad belt. Although minor details often vary, the same basic style of costume is depicted. However, on the red-figure vases of the 5th and 4th centuries BC it is unusual to find any representations of the Hittite-style tunic.

South Italian vases of the 4th century BC There are a large number of vases showing phlyakes wearing a loosely fitting tunic over a tricot. The tunics are, for the most part sleeveless and a ribbon is worn around the waist. Numerous examples of this type of tunic are illustrated in A.D. TrendalPs Phlyax Vases (1959; 2nd ed. 1967). The tunic is closely related to the loosely fitting Lucanian example shown in plate 6 (cf. Ch. 1,2). Attic terracotta statuettes There are a number of Attic terracotta statuettes depicting phlyakes of South Italian type. A mould for one of the sets was found in the agora at Athens. They are now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York (13.225). Trendall &amp; Webster 1971: 127-8, IV, 9. nos 13, 14, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27 a-b.

General comments The tunic and loin-cloth may be assumed to have originated in the Middle East. It is from this area that the first prehistoric, iconographie representations of such garments are known. The Greeks adopted these garments and introduced them into Europe. Over the centuries they spread from east to west.</page><page sequence="42">The Samnite Warrior's Appearance 15 The Samnite tunic appears in various shapes and has an individual character. It was based on an old and simple way of treating the fabric. Exactly when and where the Samnites first created their form of the tunic is still unknown. Quite a number of Italiote garments are recorded in iconographie representations. The patterns on a number of Samnite tunics, as represented in art (e.g. on Italiote vases), may be ascribed to contemporary fashion. This point is further emphasised by the representations of Samnite warriors on Apulian vases where the patterns belong to a different decorative system. As a brief addendum, it should be noted that the tunic and loin-cloth of this sort are not only seen on vases but also on reliefs and plastic monuments, e.g. on bronze situlae and the statue of the warrior from Capestrano dated to the 6th century BC. (cf. the relationship of both below, Ch. 2, 3). 4 The Broad Belt Artistic origins of the broad belt The broad belt, like the Samnite tunic it accompanied, originated in the Middle East. In its earliest form, which goes back to before the second millennium BC, it consisted simply of two or three strings worn around the waist (Lutz 1923: 143, figs 96-102, Mesopotamian seal designs). The broad belt, which was worn by both men and women, seems to make its earliest appearance in art in the 3rd millennium. Later, the Hittites produced statuettes of a naked female idol in cult posture wearing a broad belt around her waist. Developing from this type of statuette is a silver figurine encrusted with gold. The figure wears a broad strip of gold which is loosely tied like a ribbon. This feature tapers at the back and is knotted as though it was made in a soft fabric. The belt seems to be kept in place by a sort of pair of braces which consist of two broad strips of gold (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: 25, 28, pl. VIII, fig. 22). Hittite examples do not seem to occur before the 18th century BC. The first examples are two miniature lead figurines representing a divine couple. Both wear a broad belt over an ample skirt and are rendered en relief (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: 43, fig. 35). Dated to the 1 7th/l 6th century is a miniature ivory figurine (3.9 cm in height) of a kneeling woman in cult posture. Her long ample skirt is kept together by a richly decorated broad belt rendered en relief The piece is thought to be an import from Syrian-Hittite territory (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: 59, fig. 42,1-2). A South Anatolian bronze statuette (now in a private collection in St Louis, Missouri) dated to the 16th century is a female idol like the silver statuette mentioned above. Here the broad belt is not done en relief but the upper and lower edges are incised (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: 58, fig. 42,2). Furthermore there are the Hittite artistic masterpieces showing relief statues showing gods, demons and kings wearing tunics as well as broad belts. These have been mentioned earlier, Ch. 1, 3 (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: figs 64-5, 109, 111,1 13, 127 &amp; 146). The broad bronze belt The earliest example of the combination of the broad belt with the tunic or loin-cloth appeared in Hittite art dated to the 16th century BC; this has been discussed earlier (cf. Ch. 1, 3). The origins of the broad belt can be further traced through a group of bronze belts from South Anatolia which is dated to the 8th/7th centuries BC. Some of these are decorated with patterns which may show signs of foreign influence on the local work; e.g. meander and rosette patterns. Excavations have shown how the continuity of the bronze</page><page sequence="43">16 Chapter 1 belt may be traced, albeit at times sporadically, geographically from the Near East to Western Europe and chronologically from the 8th/7th to the 5th/4th centuries BC. The broad bronze belt comes in various lengths and widths. It can be closed at the front or at the back. At the front there is a clasp which fastens on to a series of vertical holes in the other end of the belt. These patterns of vertical holes occur in sequences in order that the length of the belt may be altered. The upper and lower edges of the belt are often done en relief. Parallel with the lower edge there is a small row of holes which may have served to fasten a lining to the belt; all other traces of such linings are now lost. The belt can be made of plain bronze but in a number of cases it is decorated, according to varying degrees of elaboration, with patterns à jour , incisions or motifs en relief. Some examples of the broad bronze belt Three bronze belts from Phrygia - 8th/ 7th century BC a) Found at Mausoleum Hill, near Ankara.

Found at Castiglione di Conversano together with two native geometric vases, an Italic helmet of Corinthian type dated to the 6th century BC, and other metal work (Degrassi 1962: 232). It is entirely covered in decoration and is fastened by three parallel hooks. It is reminiscent of the 'Villanovan' type of the 8th/7th century BC, although that example only had two hooks. Samnite type fragment of a bronze belt - 5th century BC 2) Plate 41. The fragment is now lodged in the Museo del Sannio, Benevento. It is recorded as as having been found in a tomb in 'territorio Beneventano'. This well preserved fragment has rows of holes at both edges. There is the remains of an embossed serpentine decoration. It has two hooks which look as though they would have fitted closely into the other end of the belt, which is now lost. The hooks do not seem to have been added but were presumably made in one piece with the rest of the belt. Galasno 1983: 34-5, fig. 29.

This completely preserved belt is now in the Museum Antické Umění, Prague. The belt is similar in type to the Capuan fragments. The museum also has a single loose hook which must have come from a belt of the same basic type. Antické Umetli , no. 257 (ill.). Photograph courtesy of the Museum Antické Umění, Prague. The broad belt as shown on vases and tomb-paintings In representational art, the belts are shown in added white, red or black paint. These paintings can be taken to represent the plain bronze Samnite type belts mentioned above. Of particular interest is the way in which the various sorts of decoration are summarily represented. Several paintings convey the impression of the belt having been decorated with small motifs without precise forms being drawn to indicate this. Just as significant is the way in which certain ways of buckling re-occur here and there over a long time-scale. For example the 'Villanovan' type with hooks and holes to receive them is dated to the 6th century BC by excavation finds. Much older forms were of buckling were still current in the 4th century. These have their origins in the Daedalic or even Hittite periods. w Fig. 13 Clasp represented by two lines, after skyphos, Berkeley 8/3243 Fig. 1 5 Clasp represented by two opposed semi-circular lines, after hydria, Vatican Astarita coll. 56 Fig. 14 Clasp represented by a row of parallel vertical lines in added white, after skyphos, Ruhr-Universität S996 Fig. 16 Clasp represented by two hooks fitting into two holes, after a Capuan tomb-painting</page><page sequence="46">The Samnite Warrior's Appearance 19 It is also remarkable that Samnite women are shown wearing plain or decorated broad belts.

This type of buckle recalls the 'Villanovan' type bronze belt dated to the 8th/7th century BC, which was discussed earlier. It is also similar to the 6th century example from Castiglione di Conversano mentioned above (v. plate 40). Conclusions It is remarkable that the shape of the broad bronze belt worn by the Samnites was based upon a type of belt which first appeared in Europe in the 8th/7th century BC, the so-called 'Villanovan' type. Apparently, all bronze belts were lined. The linings were attached by being sewn through holes which ran along the edges of the belts. In the main the belts were fastened by hooks at one end fitting into corresponding holes at the other end. There were sets of holes in the latter end to enable the belt to be adjusted to fit the girth of the wearer. The hooks could be fastened in a number of ways and could also be decorated. The artistic representations of these belts, particularly those seen on Campanian vase painting, are inspired by bronze examples with a number of different types of clasp. These clasps have antecedents which can be traced back over a considerable period of time. The vase paintings show that there were all manner of combinations of various types of belt and tunic. Both may be decorated or both may be plain. Alternatively, one can be plain while the other can be decorated. Similarly, the extent and complexity of decoration can also vary.</page><page sequence="47">20 Chapter 1 5 Samnite Footwear The surviving representations on vases indicate that it was apparently normal for women and men, both Greek and non-Greek, to go around barefoot. Samnite warriors even when fully equipped are often shown without shoes; this is particularly the case when they are shown wearing greaves or with the characteristic single spur. In combat, whether mounted or on foot, they are frequently portrayed without shoes. Women, especially native ones, are frequently shown barefoot while dressed in their tribal costumes. Despite these facts, there are plenty of carefully drawn representations of footwear. These shoes may be drawn in the reserved technique or in added white. Because the shoes are often so carefully portrayed it is possible to discern a considerable variety of types. They may be seen not only on Italiote examples but also on Attic red-figure vases from the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The Lucanian, Apulian, Campanian, and Paestan examples are likely to have been influenced by Attic models. Normally there is little difference between the footwear worn by men and women; boots are exceptional in that they show some sexual differentiation. Women, perhaps because of their long garments, seemed to prefer ankle- high boots whereas men, both civilian and military, seem to have favoured boots reaching higher up the leg; some younger warriors are shown wearing ankle-high shoes (cf. the vases cited below under C. 4). A variety of types of footwear can be discerned where the drawing is well preserved and well enough defined. Apart from boots of different heights, there are low, ankle-high and somewhat higher shoes with the upper edge accentuated. Occasionally there is a small hole at the tip of the boot or low shoe. Sandals sometimes have white soles, which is attached to the foot by a strap around the instep. Some types of sandal leave the foot almost completely uncovered, while there are others which are laced all over, even above the ankle or even higher up the leg. Socks do not seem to have existed or at any rate they were not worn with shoes. Some vase paintings suggest that there might have been items of footwear made of soft fabrics (e.g. the footwear worn by Athenian symposiasts, below Att. 4 and 5). Other items suggestive of modern socks include the shoes of the Eros fi gure (below L.4) and those of Campanian Samnite warriors done in outline technique (C.3 below). Also of significance is the so-called 'Ionian-type' footwear with the round and turned-up toe, which was possibly introduced into mainland Greece by Ionian East Greeks. Low shoes and boots may be seen worn by both men and women on Attic black- and red-figure vases as well as on Italiote vessels. It is also noteworthy that a kind of forerunner appears on Hittite reliefs where gods, demons and priests are represented wearing heavy-looking boots of this type (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: pis 92-3, 1 1 1 (dated to 1050-850 BC), 127 (dated 850-700 BC) &amp; 128 (dated to 850 BC)). In addition, two small terracotta vases, seemingly rhyta in the shape of boots, should be mentioned. These too belong to this early period. One of them, which was found at Kültepe (8.5 cm in height), is decorated in geometric patterns, the other (5.1 cm in height) shows lines which might indicate the way in which the pieces of leather, from which real shoes were made, were sewn together (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: pl. 33, 2-3; L'Art au Pays des Hittites, 6000 à 600 av. J.C. , Collections des Musées de Turquie 1964: no. 104 (ill.); no. 106 (ill.) with lines like seams). There are several specimens of this kind dating from the 8th/7th century BC which have been found in the Urartian lands. During the course of the 6th century this type of footwear spread further. We find Greek influenced representations of such items in Anatolia, while the Eastern type appeared in a number of European countries. There is from Ankara in Phrygia a decorated tile which shows two warriors whose footwear reflects the influence of the Archaic Greek style. They wear the Eastern type boot with the curved turned-up toe but the shape of the boot is more slender and not unlike examples known from Greek vases (Akurgal 1961: pl. VII.c).</page><page sequence="48">The Samnite Warrior's Appearance 2 1 By contrast, the Eastern type is represented on a group of bronze situlae dated to the 6th/5th century BC which are supposed to originate from the area which is in modern Yugoslavia. These situlae have been found in archaeological contexts in North Italy, beyond the river Po, in Central Italy, and south of the Danube, near Austrian Hallstatt for example (Kastelic 1965: pis 1 &amp; 67 which show boots and pl. 58 shows a boot with a turned-up toe). The single terracotta pair of Eastern type shoes which came to light on Sicily some time ago remains a unique find (Zanotti Bianco 1961: 97, no. 87). Much earlier than this, however, these terracotta shoe vases seem to have spread over a number of different countries.

Some general observations on high-laced boots and sandals It seems that various methods were used to secure the laces, especially with regard to keeping the horizontal part in place. In some cases we see a short curving line at the upper edge of the horizontal part and two vertical lines, or sometimes only one, running across the horizontal laces. At ankle height there is sometimes another short, curving or pointed line, e.g. Toledo 81.110, reverse (L. 6, v. fig. 23). On the other hand, there are some cases which lack the vertical lines, e.g. BM F 297 (here Ap. 11) where the horizontal laces are kept in place by buttons, painted in white. No buttons or vertical laces are applied on BM F 376 (Ap. 7) where the curving line at the top might indicate that they were tucked in to the upper edge of the boot. High-laced boots L. 6 Volute krater, Toledo 81.110. Fig. 23.

Gh. 1, 2 and APPENDIX. Some observations on the high-laced boots preferred by paidagogoi High-laced boots are part of the standard costume of Apulian paidagogoi. This is not the case with Campanian and Paestan examples. The following are examples of the latter two groups: a) Plate 51 A drawing by Tischbein (Weege 1909: 133, fig. 13 after Tischbein, I 60) shows a lost Campanian vase painting bearing the remarkable scene of a female (?paidagogos) instructing a female acrobatic dancer on the upper register (cf. Ch. 5, 2); on the lower register a barefooted youth is shown with his sword raised as he stops a duel. One of the combatants in the duel is a Samnite and wears the typical Samnite cuirass. For this drawing cf. Ch. 3, 4. b) Plate 52 On a Paestan tomb-painting a barefoot and bearded man wearing a himation stops the duel with his right hand down (Weege 1909: 118, no. 33, fig. 8 based upon a drawing of the original which is now lost).

These boots have two vertical rows of laces extending down over part of the plain foot area. These laces are flanked by white buttons. A kind of heel is indicated in added white. The upper edge of these boots has a band in added white. These boots have white flaps which hang down from their upper edge. They are worn by a paidagogos who is standing inside a temple at Eleusis. The paidagogos is listening to Medea who stands before him talking. He wears the usual costume which has been described above. His chiton is knee length and he wears a black cord or belt tied around the waist. He also has a wide cloak around his shoulders which, as usual, is fastened by a booch beneath the chin. His right hand is held under his chin and is covered by the cloak. He rests his head on a white stick held in his right hand. The paidagogos is white haired and bearded. He holds a pilos in his left hand which is held behind his back; as a result the pilos is half-hidden. Darius Painter. Trendall 1984; RVAp Suppl. I (18/4 la), p. 78, pl. XII.

These plain high boots have their upper edge drawn as a single line while there is another which runs just below and parallel to it. They are worn by a Samnite who is a hunter.

Napoli 1970a: 62, fig. 101. Finally there is another group of representations of footwear which may be mentioned in addition to vase and tomb-paintings. There is a small number of moulded vases in the shape of a human foot or leg on which sandals, shoes or boots are represented in paint (Maximova 1927; Higgins 1959; Ducat 1966). The style of these vases has led them to be called 'Ionian' or 'East Greek', like the aforementioned footwear with turned-up toe. Rhodes, Samos, Paros, Crete, Corinth, Eretria and Boeotia are assumed to be places of origin. One such vase, found in Akragas, is assumed to have been made using an East Greek mould. Such plastic vases are made in two parts. The leg is turned on the wheel and the moulded foot is added later. The foot is made in two moulds one for each side of the foot. The top of a plastic vase can be cut off flat or have a mouth resembling a lekythos or an aryballos. These vases are dated to the 6th century BC. The footwear painted on them is similar to the types known from Attic and Italiote vases of the 5th and 4th centuries BC; often, however, they are more colourful and portrayed in greater detail. For a list of the related types v. the index to this section below. Some examples of footwear as represented on plastic vases (As with the previous list the vases here are listed according to the type of footwear rather than the type or date of the vases). Sandal painted on a plastic foot (type 1) PF. 1 BM 24.3-10.5. From Samos. The sandal has a strap running across the toes, from which another strap runs up to the ankle, where it is combined with the strap running around the ankle. A short thong splits from both the right and left hand sides of the strap which runs over the foot. These short thongs are fastened to a broad, decorated strap which is divided into two parts and comes from the back of the foot. At the back the two halves of this strap are united to form a leather tongue. Plastic foot: 90 mm high. It is probably a left foot and was made in two half moulds. The mouth of the vase resembles that of an aryballos. It has a broad plaque at the back which is decorated with a Gorgon's head. The sandal has a sole attached which is indicated by horizontal lines which are presumably supposed to indicate different layers of leather. The decoration, including the Gorgon's head, is done in black glaze with added red and white. Payne (1931: 88, no. 3) dated this vase to the second half of the 6th century BC based upon the style of the Gorgon's head. Higgins 1959: 32-3, no. 1655, pl. 22.</page><page sequence="62">The Samnite Warrior's Appearance 35 Sandal painted on a plastic foot (type 2€ ) PF.2 BM 1928. 1-17.49. This type of footwear is related to type 1 above. This example is more completely covered with straps, however. Plastic foot: 80 mm high. In terms of technique and shape this vase may be related to that described above (no. 1655; here PF. 1). Like the above it has an aryballos type mouth but the plaque at the back is smaller in this instance. It is decorated with a palmette in black glaze with added red and white. The sole of the sandal is decorated with black knobs. Dated to the 3rd quarter of the 6th century BC based upon the style of the palmette which may be compared with those on the Little Master cups. Higgins 1959: 33-4, no. 1656, pl. 23; Ducat 1966: 182, no. 1. Sandal painted on a plastic foot (type 2 related to type 1) PF. 3 BM 1950. 2-II.I. From Acragas, Sicily. The sandal painted on this foot is laced in a similar way to those on vase no. 1655 (here PF. 1), however the paint has mostly been rubbed off in this example. Plastic foot similar to no. 1655 (here PF. 1): 100 mm high. In terms of technique this vase is again similar to no. 1655. The mouth is of aryballos type. The plaque at the back is smaller than in no. 1655. The sole of this example is left undecorated. Probably a South Italian version of an East Greek type. The clay is orange with mica and has a pale green slip. Higgins 1959: 47, no. 1680, pl. 33. Sandal painted on a plastic foot (related to types 1 &amp; 2) PF. 4 Athens National Museum, NM 2072. From Crete. The sandal is similar to the type 1 example. The paint is partly rubbed off. Plastic foot: 166 mm high. The shape is similar to nos 1655 and 1656 (here PF. 1 and PF. 2 respectively), but it does not have the aryballos type mouth. Instead the vase broadens towards the upper edge which is cut off flat. There is a broad band beneath the upper edge. Ducat 1966: 185, pl. XXIV. 3. Sandal painted on the foot of the boot of a plastic leg (fragmentary; the laces assumed to be going up the leg are not discernible) PF. 5 BM 42.4 - 4.9. From Vulci. Formerly in the Feoli collection. This example is laced on the foot in a way similar to no. 1655 (PF. 1). Plastic leg is 1 10 mm high. It is incompletely restored from fragments. Decoration on the leg is not discernible. Higgins 1959: 30, no. 1651, pl. 20. Sandal painted on the foot of the boot of a plastic leg PF. 6 Berlin F 1307 (A 22). The foot is laced in a way broadly similar to no. 1655 (here PF. 1). There is a knot at ankle height which keeps the laces in place. The upper edge of what might have been a high-laced boot undulates down to the front. There are two parallel lines beneath the upper edge. The leg forms an open vase shape which was closed with a cover with a knob. There is a band round the mouth of the vessel which is filled with geometric patterns. Ducat 1966: 135, pl. XX.3. No measurements are given; the place of origin is unknown. Maximova 1927: no. 80, pl.

The tongue extends above the upper edge of the boot and ends in a tongue-patterned border with a volute on either side. At the back above the boot, is a large decorative rosette. The plastic leg is 280 mm high. The vase has an open móuth. The rim of the vase is decorated with a broad ornate band. The vase is covered in black glaze with added red and white. Higgins 1959: 29, no. 1650, pl. 21; Ducat 1966: 134, no. 1, pl. XX. 1-2. (For the turned-up toe v. also the vase labelled here as Ap. 9). Boot on bent plastic legs PF. 9 Louvre CA 3547.

XXI. 1. PF. 10 Berlin, Antiquarium, F 1308. A laced up boot extends halfway up the leg but no details are discernible. The upper edge has the same curve as the plastic leg. It differs from the above (PF. 9) (Ducat 1966: 135, no. 8, pl.

Ankle-high or slightly higher shoes were particularly favoured by young boys and young warriors (C. 6 boy; C. 4 young warriors) although a fully grown warrior could also wear such items (C. 3 and C. 7). Boots, low- or high-laced, were popular with fully grown warriors (C. 8, C. 9 and C. 10). The young boy who wears high-laced open-toed boots, as he returns with his father from combat, may be considered an exceptional case (C. 13). A young warrior is shown with high-laced boots with turned-up toes (C. 12). Sandals were seemingly not in favour with boys or warriors.</page><page sequence="65">Chapter 2 The Samnite Warrior's Equipment Samnite military equipment, both defensive and aggressive, occurs in a variety of forms in a great number of artistic representations. Warriors are often shown with both defensive and aggressive items. There are, for example, the libation scenes and the combat scenes, as well as others, where a warrior is shown busily preparing himself for war, by checking his arms and putting on his armour and so forth (cf. Ch. 2, 4 and Ch. 2, 7 below). The Defensive Equipment: Samnite Armour 1 The Samnite Helmet The Samnite helmet is made distinctive by a variety of details; however, it is basically related in shape to the Attic type. It takes the form of a calotte with front neck- and cheek- guards. There is also a crest and a plume made up of a variable number of feathers. Some examples of different shapes of the Samnite helmet Simple calotte form a) Fig. 30. This type of helmet is cut out of one piece of metal without a crest and cheek- guards: these are indicated by a piece of metal which sticks out in combination with the frontal-guard. The neck-guard is short, going right down to the back of the calotte. After Saulnier 1983: 62-3, no. 1, from the neck amphora (Naples 870/82744) ascribed to the Three- Dot Group: LCS (2/342), p. 276, pl. 1 12.6. (Vase not illustrated here). b) Fig. 31. This type is related to that discussed above (a). However this example also has a piece sticking out on the top and the back which was designed to hold a crest as well as cheek-guards with curved sides. After Saulnier 1983: 62-3, no. 2, from the bell krater (Rio de Janiero 1495) ascribed to the Siamese Painter: LCS (2/902), p. 352, pl. 136.3-5. (Vase not illustrated here). Crested helmet The Samnite crest consisted of a horse-tail which was fastened onto a small metal piece on the top of the helmet. The end of this tail hung freely at the back of the helmet. There were thin and 'bushy haired' crests with short or long free-flowing ends. Low or high crests were sometimes given special forms. Particularly high crests were pinned on high peaks which were attached to the top of the helmet. (For examples of Samnite crested helmet v. Saulnier 1983: 62, nos 3-8).</page><page sequence="66">40 Chapter 2 Q Fig. 30 Calotte-shaped helmet (after Saulnier 1983: 62-3, no. 1) *9 Fig. 31 Calotte-shaped helmet (after Saulnier 1983: 62-3, no. 2) Fig. 32 Crested helmet (after Saulnier 1983: 62-3, no. 7) Helmet with a high short crest Fig. 32. This helmet has a thin high crest ending in a free-flowing tail. The frontal guard is attached to the calotte.

Helmets with an extremely high crest (This type also has two subsidiary crests: there are several helmets of this type). a) Fig. 33. This crest is found on an extremely high calotte decorated with a long line which ends in a volute. The crest is attached to a high peak and has a long tail which hangs down loose. All the guards are cut in one piece out of the calotte. Two other small crests are attached on either side of the calotte; both have a short tail and are located at the low part of the calotte. After Saulnier 1983: 66-7, no. 6. This example was found in Macedonia. This type of helmet, with the highest of crests, is often combined with the linen corselet in the iconographie record, cf. the discussion of this type of corselet in Ch. 2, 3. b) Paes tan tomb-painting, short side of a sarcophagus (Andriuolo Tomb 58). Plate 63. The helmet illustrated has a highly stylised crest. It is worn by a warrior on horseback who is portrayed before a calyx krater. The crest is divided into various parts. The centre of the crest, which is on the top of the helmet, is short; the outer parts both right and left are long and curved.

How crests were attached In most, if not all, cases the crests are lost so that we cannot see how they were attached to the top of the helmets. Sometimes, however, the form of the helmet can provide some information. Bronze plates of varying sizes were attached with rivets on the top of the helmet. They also had raised supports, cut out in one piece with the base-plate, which held the crest. Fig. 34. The figure shows clearly that the supports were cut in one piece with the bronze plate so that the plate could act as a base for them. After Adamesteanu 1974: 178, showing a 5th century Apulo-Corinthian helmet from Lavello. A similar method for attaching horns to a helmet seems to have been used on a single bronze helmet which is discussed at the end of this section (plate 64a &amp; b).

She wears a feathered helmet: this type of helmet is shown elsewhere worn by non-Greeks (Moret 1978: 76-8, pl. 23.3; RVP (3/450), p. 319, pl. 206). Tradition had it that Mars, who was said to have had a temple at Capua, wore feathers when he appeared on the side of the Romans in their battle with the Samnites at Aquilonia in 293 BC (for the Samnite cult of Mars v. Heurgon 1942: 92; Heurgon 1972: 68). The Samnites were not the only ones to wear feathers on their helmets. Representations of warriors wearing feathers are also found on Attic vases and Roman coins. Unfortunately, neither vase-paintings nor tomb-paintings tell us why feathers first came to be placed on Samnite helmets. Lucilius, the 2nd century BC poet, describes a farce performed in the streets of Capua which contained a 'mock-fight'. In this 'mock-fight' the winner put the feathers of the loser on his helmet (v. below Ch. 3, 4). The farce might have been based on an old tradition dating back to the c.4th century BC, while the practice of the victor taking the feathers of the loser may have its origins in a custom associated with real combat. The attachment of the feathers (with or without the crest) The feathers could be attached in one of the following ways: i) between a circular piece of bronze and the helmet on either side of the helmet (Saulnier 1983: 64-5, no. 4). ii) between the helmet and cheek-guards at the point at which they meet (Saulnier 1983:64-5, no. 1). iii) feathers without crest can be located on top of the helmet: here the attachment is not visible (Saulnier 1983: 64-5, nos 2 &amp; 3). Examples of feathered helmets without crests a) Fig. 35. One feather is attached on either side between the frontal guard and the cheek guard. The frontal guard is attached to the calotte while the cheek-guards and the back-guard are cut out of it. The cheek-guard has a curved outline.

He uses both hands to keep his spear in place. Behind him stands another warrior who may be assumed to be his arms bearer. This second warrior wears a richly feathered helmet. It is likely that it is his master's second spear which is stuck vertically into the ground and held in his right hand; the large shield on the ground may also be his master's which he carries home from combat.

Weege 1909: 138).</page><page sequence="71">The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 45 The horns The horns dominate the appearance of the helmet because of their size. When they are shown in vase-painting they are depicted in solid black on the side of the helmet (cf. Hampe 1975: pl. 1.1). Their size suggests that they would have been heavy and therefore it may be assumed that they were not worn in combat. They occupy the main surface on the top of the helmet. As there is no crest visible we may assume that they were fastened in the same way as the crest; cf. the above mentioned sketch by Adamesteanu 1974: 178 (here fig. 34). A bronze helmet with bull's ears and horns Plate 64a &amp; b Here I shall give a short summary of helmet described more fully in Lorenz 1980: 136, pis 3 1-33: Provenance is apparently unknown. From the collection of Professor Wyss, once on the German market, Martin von Wagner Museum, Würzburg. Whereabouts now unknown. It may be concluded from the difference between the frontal and rear height measurements that it is a Greek helmet of Corinthian type datable to c.490 BC. The measurements are as follows: frontal height = 26.5 cm; rear height=19.5 cm; width = 18.7 cm. The helmet is heavily repaired although this is visible, in the main, on the inside. The tips of both horns and part of the neck-guard are missing. The horns and the ears are attached to the helmet by means of bronze plates which acted as a kind of seating for them. These plates were themselves riveted to the helmet (Lorenz 1980: pl. 33,1-4). There is part of an inscription in the Greek alphabet which survives; the letter delta is the most clearly visible. Hampe (1975: pl. 1.1) shows a red-figure skyphos depicting a warrior in profile wearing a helmet with what seems to be a small horn and carrying a large shield with a wild bull emblem. This skyphos, in the Berlin Staatliche Museen (1970.1), is ascribed to the Triptolemos Painter (v. also Lorenz 1980: 136, note 20). 2 The Celtic Helmet The Celtic helmet is rare among the Samnites and other South Italian groups. As far as we know, there exists only one bronze statuette of a Samnite hoplite wearing both a Celtic helmet and a Samnite bronze cuirass (cf. Ch. 2, 3 below) (Plate 70a &amp; b). The Celtic helmet had several different forms which had begun to be introduced throughout South Italy from the 5th century BC when the Celts started to invade Italy from central Europe crossing the Alps (Stary 1979a: 198-200). Over time the pointed shape of the cap of the Celtic helmet developed a more rounded form until its high peak vanished completely. Illustrations of Celtic helmets put in sequence from early to late ones give a good overview of their entire development (v. Connolly 1978: 62). The Celtic helmet on the South Italian bronze statuette Bronze statuette from Sicily, Louvre Br-124. Plate 70a &amp; b. The helmet shown on this statuette has a slightly pointed shape to the calotte, particularly when seen from the back, but lacks the high peak. These features date the helmet, and therefore the statuette, to the early 3rd century BC. The helmet has frontal- and back-guards. The cheek-guards are plain and of the so-called 'S- form' which belong with this type of helmet and provide chronological data which are entirely consistent with those provided by the helmet itself. The statuette comes from Sicily but the type of breast-plate suggests that it is a Samnite who is depicted (cf. Ch. 2, 3 below).</page><page sequence="72">46 Chapter 2 The back of the helmet shows a rather archaic method of construction. Two or three bronze plates were combined in such a way that the edges of the plates were visible at the spot where they were fastened together. (Stary 1979a: pl. 22a, and p. 191 on the archaic method of construction). Photograph courtesy of the Musée du Louvre. The single Celtic helmet from South Italy Plate 71 The only surviving Celtic helmet from South Italy is now in the Museo Nazionale at Ancona, inv. 3793. It is 55 cm in height. The helmet has a slightly pointed form and a round lower edge. It has a frontal- guard but no neck-guard. The cheek-guards are in the shape of the Samnite cuirass type 2 and are decorated in the Celtic fashion with 2 circles with a single circle below them, imitating the typical triple-plate cuirass. The decoration consists of two parallel relief bands around the lower edge with a circular knob in relief immediately above the upper band corresponding with the cheek-guards. Noteworthy is the high peak which rises out of a knob on top of the helmet. This type of feature was used in earlier periods to hold a high crest (v. 'Crested helmets' above) but this poses the question as to whether this helmet belonged to a Celt or a Samnite. This feature is well documented on Samnite helmets but is hitherto unknown on Celtic ones. This helmet is included in the illustrated developmental sequence provided by Connolly 1978: 62, no. 6. v. also Salmon 1978: pl. 45. Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 62, pl. 66.

The helmet is depicted in a combat scene on the neck of the vase. Two warriors belonging to unknown tribal groups are shown fighting with antenna swords. One lies on the ground, almost vanquished. He wears a Celtic helmet which is distinguishable by its pointed shape, the absence of a knob on the top and the presence of a circular knob in relief right above the lower edge and the cheek- guard. The cheek-guards are difficult to make out. The type of helmet portrayed, together with the nestoris itself, can be dated to c.330/325 BC. Choephoroi Painter.

It is a form said to originate in South Italy. Made up of three discs, it was worn at the front as well as at the back (v. Plate 72 below). The Samnite cuirass is constructed in the following way: there are two upper discs with a third disc below the two and in a position mid-way between them. Together they form a sort of triangle pattern. On top is a straight, decorated upper edge. There are three types of Samnite cuirass: Type 1 is, as described above, with three identical discs. The spaces between them are filled up with pieces of bronze to which small rings are attached for holding the side straps</page><page sequence="73">The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 47 which bound the front and back part of the cuirass together. Shoulder straps were fastened onto small rings above the previously mentioned horizontal upper edge (plate 72). Type 2 is similar to type 1, but has an edge which does not follow the pattern of the three discs; thus, producing a coherent outline to the cuirass (v. plate 73a &amp; b showing the front and back of this type of cuirass). Type 3 is similar to type 2 but has two sub-variants: a) has a decorated edge and the third disc shows the head of Athena in low relief (plate 74) b) similar to 3a but instead of Athena's head has a demon's head (plate 75). Examples of the Samnite bronze cuirass Type 1 la. Alfedena, Museo A. de Nino. Plate 72. The cuirass may be reconstructed in the following way: the front and back are joined by shoulder and side straps.

The decoration of the third disc allow us to date the cuirass more precisely: a) The head of Athena: this seems to be a variety of the Acropolis Athena from the early 4th century BC. This example shows evidence of Tarentine influence; the heavy chin is comparable to that seen on Tarentine terracottas. b) The head of the demon: early Hellenistic period dated to the end of the 4th/ early third century BC. The style is somewhat classical; note the Graeco-Italic style portrayal of the hair. The Samnite bronze cuirass in vase-painting It is remarkable that the details found on Samnite bronze cuirasses are not depicted in vase-painting. The vase-painters show only the basic pattern: of the 'triangle' formed by the three discs with the 'apex' at the bottom. Furthermore, it is interesting that up to now no paintings have been found which show the Samnite triple-plate cuirass being used in combat. On the contrary a considerable number of representations show that such armour was worn on ceremonial occasions. The following examples illustrate this phenomenon. The list is by no means exhaustive.

Before the battle of Aquilonia, 293 BC, an offering had been made and the noblemen took an oath of devotio vowing death to themselves and their descendants if they failed in battle. Then they selected their followers by a system of individual choice. Those elected are described as wearing linen corselets and high-crested helmets.

Cuirass made of scales This type of cuirass was depicted on a Capuan tomb-painting which is now destroyed. It was described by F. Weege (1909). A cavalryman was shown in full gallop. He wore a golden cuirass of scales and a golden helmet. His helmet had a red and white crest, horns and feathers. Weege 1909: 106-7, no. 12. For the type of helmet described v. Weege 1909: fig. 16.3.

This latter example also has arm-guards. The problem of the origins of the Samnite cuirass In his book, The making of Roman Italy , Salmon illustrates the Samnite cuirass from Alfedena (Salmon 1982: pl. 17). In his caption he notes without further comment that the 'three-disc Samnite corselet' did not develop out of the 'prehistoric one-disc heart protector' although this is the 'common view'. For the history of this 'common view' we turn to Weege (1909: 146-52) and to the other contemporary scholars he mentions. It was Weege's theory in particular which was generally accepted until the 1970s. Since then new light has been shed on this problem. Weege's starting point was his interpretation of the word spongia in Livy (IX.40.3), where the text says that the Samnites used spongia as pectori tegumentum1. Weege focussed his attention on the large number of richly decorated bronze discs found over a wide area in the Abruzzi, Umbria, Picenum, South Etruria, Basilicata, and in particular from Alfedena, a village in the central Abruzzi. He saw in a private collection in Alfedena one such example which he published and illustrated; although he did not give the diameter (Weege 1909: 148, fig. 19). In the local Museum, he saw excavated skeletons which had a single bronze disc on the breast (Weege 1909: 150). On the inside of some of these discs he noticed remnants of fabric which he took to be the remains of a garment related to the spongia. He assumed that the three-disc Samnite cuirass developed over a period of time (by adding a second and then a third bronze disc). Until the early 1930s there was no known representation of a warrior wearing a heart- protector (i kardiophylax ). When, in c.1934, the statue of a warrior (2.09 m in height) was found at Capestrano, in the Picenum area, not far from Pescara, it was the first time that scholars were presented with a picture of such di kardiophylax (plate 81a &amp; b) (Schefold 1967: 327-8, fig. 424; Colonna 1974: 197; Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 197, figs 117-18). Photographs courtesy of the Museo Nazionale, Chieti. Dated to the 6th century BC the limestone statue from Capestrano is not the earliest of its kind. It has a predecessor also found in the same area. This latter statue is badly 1 Lat. spongia literally "sponge"; pectori tegumentum "protection for the chest". For Weege the spongia seems to have been some kind of padded corselet to which a heart-protector could be fastened. However the metaphorical uses of Latin spongia - which seem to relate not to softness but to anything with sponge-like interstices - raise the possibility that what Livy actually meant was a coat of mail). EH</page><page sequence="77">The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 51 damaged. Its body is out of proportion but interestingly some recognisable remnants of straps survive which had once served to hold a heart-protector in place (plate 82a &amp; b; Chieti Mus. inv. n. 8610). Photograph courtesy of the Museo Nazionale, Chie ti. The Capestrano warrior (plate 81a &amp; b) is depicted in straight frontal view and flanked by two pillars with are connected to the base on which the warrior stands. The figure is not completely separated from the stone out of which it was carved. From the shoulder to the elbow the arms are sculpted in relief at the front but joined to the stone at the back. The feet are, one may say, carved en relief. The same is true of all the adjunct pieces, e.g. the closely fitting loin-cloth with its broad belt and the armour. The armour consists of a long sword with an elaborate hilt, the so-called 'antenna' sword (v. the Lucanian Type II nestoris, here plate 28a &amp;b, discussed in greater detail below), and a heart-protector. The warrior also has a necklace and rings on his upper arms. One of the most eye-catching features of this statue is the large and stiff hat with a peak on top which was probably meant to hold a crest. This hat and the inscription of the warrior's name on one of the pillars indicate the high military rank he must have achieved in the inter-tribal warfare of South Italy. Although the inscription is normally reckoned to be in the 'Chietan' language, the warrior need not necessarily belong to the Chietan area. To date, hats of the shape worn by this warrior are known from two other monuments: one from Northern Italy and one from Southeast Europe. A rather large terracotta wearing a similar hat has been found relatively recently during the excavations of a local temple near Siena. The hat worn by this figure seems less rigid and has an added peak unlike that seen on the Capestrano statue. The figure found at Poggio Civitate, near Siena, is in a fragmentary condition and has been reconstructed as an akroterion seated on the roof tile (plate 83). (Gantz 1972: 167-235; Bianchi Bandinelli 1972: 236-47; Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 374, pl. 446). Other figures wearing similar headgear of the less rigid type only this time without the peak, are to be seen on 6th century bronze situlae which are found in considerable quantity in parts of modern Yugoslavia, Austria and Italy, v. for example the Certosa situla, Museo Nazionale, Bologna (plate 84) (Kastelic 1964: 125, pl. 25; Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 213, fig. 248). Photograph courtesy of the Museo Nazionale, Bologna. It remains open to debate whether all three groups of artefacts, the Capestrano warrior, the figure from the temple at Siena and the bronze situlae, were made by the same tribal group as the warriors they depict (i.e. those who wear the type of hat described above). If this is the case, the name of this tribal group is unknown. However, our main concern here is the heart-protector worn by the Capestrano warrior. It is worn over the bare chest and fastened by complicated means. Along the edge of the disc are four points which each have a strap fastened to them; however, each strap is fastened in a different way. The simplest fastening is to be found at the front on the upper two straps. The lower strap has a small bracket added between the edge of the disc and the strap. This is roughly comparable to the way the bronze cuirass from Alfedena is fastened (plate 72). It is more difficult to discuss the disc worn on the Capestrano warrior's back because it is hard to discern how all the straps were attached. Within ten years of the discovery of the Capestrano warrior three stone menhirs were found at two different sites (fig. 41a-c). One (fig. 41a) was found at Castello Ticino near the mouth of the river Po, while the other two (fig. 41b &amp; c) were found at Guardiagrele, not far from Chieti (Colonna 1974: 202, pl. XLIV). Although all three have badly damaged surfaces, heart-protectors can be discerned on them. Moreover, both fig. 41b and fig. 41c have the remains of straps which are attached to the discs in a simpler way than is seen on the Capestrano warrior. The heart-protector on fig. 41a is the best preserved and has a diameter of 27 cm. It has two circles as internal decoration. The spear depicted on the surface might identify the menhir as representing a warrior (the spear is not visible on the sketch; fig. 41a). A fourth stone menhir, also from Guardiagrele near Chieti, may be added to this list (Mus. Chieti inv. n. 4932) (here shown in both frontal and rear views; plate 85a &amp; b,</page><page sequence="78">52 Chapter 2 photograph courtesy of the Museo Nazionale, Chieti). This menhir has a head which though damaged allows some features to be discerned. It seems that there is no head-gear and that the face was probably bearded. The figure wears a richly worked necklace. The figure also wears a large heart-protector. The straps are attached to the disc in a way which is simpler than the method seen on the Capestrano warrior. All four menhirs are dated to the 6th century BC. Colonna (1974) who published the first three menhirs (fig. 41a-c), combined the evidence from the heart-protectors depicted on the menhirs and on the Capestrano warrior with the Alfedena discs previously noted by Weege. He followed Weege in supporting the idea that the pattern of three discs developed from the single disc over the course of time. He suggested that the bronze statuette of a Samnite warrior, now in the Louvre, is the earliest known figure seen wearing the developed Samnite cuirass (plate 70a&amp; b) (Colonna 1974: 197-8). The disc on the largest of the three menhirs (fig. 41a) is, according to Colonna, a symbol of the social rank of the warrior depicted (Colonna 1974: 202). New evidence from a bronze heart-protector, now in the Museum at Alfedena, came to light in 1974 (plate 86) (Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 104, fig. 119). At two points on the edge of the plate there are small pieces of metal with fragments of fabric left on them. This Fig. 41 Menhirs from near Chieti (after Colonna 1974) seems to be an actual example of the kind of fastening depicted on the heart-protector of the Capestrano warrior although the small pieces of metal are not identical (v. above plate 81a &amp; b). One can deduce that it had no lining because there are no small holes running around the edge of the plate as can been seen on the bronze belts. The heart-protector has small knobs embossed all over it and a central decoration consisting of a fantastical bird- like creature. Dated to the 6th century BC, this heart-protector provided scholars with their first view of an actual example as opposed to representations of them. The problem of the origin of the heart-protector was resolved in the later 1970s when it became clear that the breast-plate worn by the Capestrano warrior had a 'direct analogy' with those seen on Assyrian Palace Reliefs from Nineveh, which are dated to between 750 and 630 BC (Stary 1979a: pl. 24a). Thus, the heart-protector belongs to a special group of armour and other objects which were new to Europe in the 6th century BC (v. e.g. the Capestrano warrior).</page><page sequence="79">The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 53 In 1979 Stary published a major article on military equipment which is of particular relevance to our theme. Among the most notable section in this article is his discussion on the Villanovan and Halstatt armour and its spread into other areas (Stary 1979a: 185-91). Furthermore, he deals with the Celtic invasions of the 5th century BC, which saw the spread of Celtic military equipment, such as the Celtic helmet, southwards from lands north of the Alps (Stary 1979a: 198-201). Last but not least, he gives an extensive list of Near Eastern arms and armour which found their way into Europe via the east coast of Italy, and Picenum in particular, in the 7th/6th century BC (Stary 1979a: 191-8). Such items included helmets with a circular cap, kardiophylakes, daggers, clubs, the short sword with cutting edges on both sides, and the round bronze shield with embossed decoration and a central boss which became especially popular in Europe. In addition, he mentions the impact that chariots and ships made on Europe. Like earlier scholars, Stary is also of the opinion that the Samnite cuirass developed from one to two and then ultimately to three discs (Stary 1979a: 191). Excursus 1 - On the use of discs and circular patterns by the Daunians The following comments should clarify Colonna's note on the heart-protector as a symbol of social or military rank (Colonna 1974: 202). It might, at the same time, bring us closer to understanding the development of the Samnite cuirass by provided a limited review of the use of discs or plates by the Daunians. A) On Daunian stelai Anthropomorphic limestone stelai are found widely in the area ascribed to the Daunians by the ancient sources (Nava 1980). Most survive only in fragments but there are a few complete ones. These stelai were only produced for two or three generations. They were produced from the late 7th century BC, throughout the 6th century and into the early part of the 5th century BC. Both front and back surfaces are covered with subgeometric ornament. On many examples square shoulders are indicated by a straight upper edge. A shapeless neck is preserved on many examples but generally the heads are missing. However, the heads often survive separately. The faces show rough, non-Greek features which are reminiscent of those of the Capestrano warrior. Almost all of these figures wear a high pilos-shaped helmet. The only other physical features portrayed are the incised hands and arms which are depicted in front of the body. The entire surface of the stelai is covered with an incised representation of a highly decorated ritual garment; indicated by the aforementioned subgeometric motifs. There is what may be loosely described as a broad belt around the waist of incised figure. Below the belt there are vertical lines which suggest vertical folds of drapery (e.g. plate 87) (Nava 1980: pl. C LXXVIII, no. 593 A). It is at times difficult to tell the difference between the sexes on some of the fragmentary stelai. However, when they are more completely preserved, sexual differentiation is clear. The male stelai are shown with arms and armour while the female ones have jewellery represented on them. The jewellery consists of one or more discs which hang from a fibula which does not appear to be used to hold the edges of a garment together. The use of discs in jewellery may be seen as a special female version of the adornment of the cuirasses (plates 88 &amp; 89; figs 42 &amp; 43) (fig. 42 is Nava 1980: pl. CLXVII, no. 584 A, while fig. 43 is Nava 1980: pl. LXXIV, no. 251 A). Some surviving items of real jewellery show that the Daunian stelai depict actual items from contemporary fashion. For example, there is some fine 6th century jewellery from near Picenum (plates 90 &amp; 91) (Salmon 1982: fig. 39; Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 60, pl. 63; 1 10, pl. 124. A comparable row of small discs on a long elaborately ornamented pin was found on a relatively recent excavation in Thessaly and dated to the 4th century BC; Miller 1986: 38, pl. 5,1-2).</page><page sequence="80">54 Chapter 2 Fig. 42 Detail of a Daunian stele, based on Nava 1980: pl. CLXVII, no. 584 A Fig. 43 Detail of a Daunian stele, based on Nava 1980: pl. LXXIV, no. 251 A Moreover many of the stelai show discs hung from the broad belt by long strings. The discs, which hang on either side of the folds, vary in size from large to small. The small ones are found on female stelai (plate 87; fig. 44; Nava 1980: pl. CLXXVIII, no. 593 A) and the large ones on the male (fig. 45 shows a schematic version of a stele emphasising the circles only; Nava 1980: pl. CCCLXX, no. 1 122 A). Similar discs made of bronze do survive. They are attached to a long chain (plate 92) (Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 368, pl. 426). Such objects have been found at Alfedena and are dated to the 6th century BC. One can perhaps suppose that they were worn on either side of the folds of male ritual costumes and on the breast of female ones. It is the real bronze counterparts of these incised representations which allow us to conclude that the jewellery seen on female stelai and the discs on a long string worn on the male examples were the accoutrements of the 'well-to-do' in Daunian society. Only these people would have been able to 'afford' such precious objects. The stelai themselves may well be expressions of wealth and status. After all, they involve a considerable investment in time and labour to decorate. Furthermore, the difficulty of transporting large pieces of Fig. 44 Detail of a Daunian stele, based on Nava 1980: pl. CLXXVIII, no. 593 A Fig. 45 Schematic detail of a Daunian stele, based on Nava 1980: pl. CCCLXX, no. 1 122 A</page><page sequence="81">Fig. 46 Handle of an 'Ordona phiale' (after De Juliis 1977: pl. LXVIII) The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 55 limestone from their source in the southern tip of the Gargano to the central Tavoliere, where many stelai are found, must have value implications. The concentration on circular patterns no doubt had a significance which is, at present, hidden to us. Nonetheless, it seems likely that the discs either indicated social rank or served to act as an ethnic indicator for the whole population. The Daunian stelai illustrate that discs do not always have to be associated with armour. On the stelai the discs are not part of a breast-plate, they are decorative. B) On Daunian vases Among the repertory of Daunian vase forms there are the 'Ordona phiale' and the brocca both of which have anthropomorphic handles (for the phiale v. De Juliis 1977: pl. LXVIII; Yntema 1985: 417, fig. 296; for the brocca v. De Juliis 1977: pl. LXXVIII; Yntema 1985: 417, fig. 294). Using a little imagination one can suggest that these handles show matt-painted representations of a ritual garment. One could take this further and argue that these garments resemble the incised clothing seen on the Daunian stelai. These vases may be safely assumed to have served in funerary rituals (fig. 46). If one accepts this interpretation of the patterns on the anthropomorphic handles one can draw more direct parallels between them and the stelai. In both cases there is an upper part of the garment and then a broad belt. Two discs hang from straps or perhaps chains below the belt. However, the discs are depicted in a different way. On the stelai they are shown on either side of the folds whereas on the handles they are shown on either side of a decorated disc. Moreover, in the latter case the discs are not attached at the ends of a strap but somewhat higher up (fig. 46). Fig. 47 Pendant motif from Daunian pottery (after De Juliis 1977: pl. XXXI, no. 74)</page><page sequence="82">56 Chapter 2 There are other details on the stelai and the vases which may be compared. Perhaps the most notable example is the representation of female jewellery. I would suggest that the motif seen on the vases which has two small discs suspended from a horizontal band by two short diagonal lines (fig. 47 after De Juliis 1977: pl. XXXI no. 74) represents the same object as is incised on the stelai, i.e. the discs attached to a fibula (figs 42 &amp; 43). The Daunian vases provide a more abstract vision of what is shown more realistically on the stelai. I would argue that these two contemporaneous types of artefact offer alternative treatments of the same subject matter; however, they differ in style and in technique. Perhaps one should not be surprised by decorative similarities between the stelai and the vases. After all, they were produced in the same area, presumably by artisans who shared the same material culture and cultural background. Moreover, they would have been made for the same people; those who honoured the dead relatives with a stele are also likely to have used the matt-painted vessels. Indeed, generic similarities of decoration are easy to observe between the stelai and the vases; much of the patterning of the stelai is geometric, as the vases are. Moreover, some of the stelai were originally painted in black and red which certainly would have made them visually similar to the matt-painted vases. Excursus 2 - Depictions of heart-protectors and tribal symbols We now turn to the depiction of Samnite heart-protectors and/or tribal indicators in the 6th to 4th centuries BC. For this period we have very few representations of items which may be interpreted either as a heart-protector or as a tribal indicator. One exception is a Lucanian bell krater, Vienna 918, which shows a warrior wearing both a heart-protector as well as some tribal symbols. This vessel is dated to 370 BC. Plate 69 Lucanian bell krater, Vienna 918. The scene shows two hoplites to the right. A young arms bearer follows his superior. They are armed in the following way: The arms bearer : the arms bearer wears a heart-protector fastened to his broad belt over his bare body. He has a pilos-shaped helmet with circular patterns around its rim. The helmet also has a semi-circular mark above the rim. In his right hand he carries a short spear or javelin decorated with a thin bunch of feathers. This type of spear is to date known only on representations of non-Greek warriors. In his left hand he has two spears of the more common type. He does not carry a shield. The senior warrior, this warrior is naked apart from his chlamys which flaps in the wind and is fastened by a brooch under his chin. He stands in a combative pose and has both a spear and a round shield. He has a peaked calotte-shaped helmet which has a row of circular patterns around the rim. His helmet has cheek-guards but lacks the semi-circular mark seen on the helmet of his arms-bearer. This warrior is not wearing a heart-protector. Some of the symbols seen on the equipment of these warriors suggest that they were both of the same tribe. The semi-circle mark might have been used to indicate some junior military rank which the arms-bearer holds.

Photograph courtesy of the Bloomington Art Museum, Indiana University. For this vase cf. Ch. 3, 1. It is clear that the heart-protector was in use for a long time, although we have not always precisely identified or dated it. Archaeological research has brought to light numerous bronze plates found in Central Europe, in Italy, both north and south of the Apennines as well as in South Italy and on the Esquiline hill in Rome; although only two have been found in Rome (Gjerstad 1966: 170, fig. 66.10). Furthermore, we have ancient sources which report on the military equipment of the pre-urban Roman Salii. The Salii were known as a religious group with military accoutrements (Gjerstad 1973: 137-8, 255-8). Other records tell us that the Salii wore embroidered tunics and a bronze belt. Livy (1.20.4) says that they wore heart-protectors over their tunics (Gjerstad 1973: 138). Polybius is useful because he provides a historical note on Roman armour in the 2nd century BC. He states that 'common soldiers wore a plate of bronze which they placed in front of their heart and called it the heart-protector kardiophylax ' (Polybius VI.23.14; Gjerstad 1973: 138). Finally, we may conclude that the heart-protector/kardiophylax, was known in Europe from the 6th to the 2nd centuries BC. It is doubtful that the Samnites wore heart- protectors regularly since there so few representations of Samnite wearing such an object from Campanian vase-painting (plate 56b above is an exception). The appearance of this type of equipment among other tribes seems similarly rare; the Lucanian bell krater, now in Vienna, is an exception (plate 69, above). B) Circular symbols Like the bell krater (Vienna 918) (plate 69) mentioned above, there are two Lucanian nestorides (discussed below), showing warriors bearing circular patterns although they are used in a different way. I would argue that these too are tribal symbols. However, the tribe in question remains unnamed. It would be rash to suggest that these vases depict Daunians although according to the literary evidence they became an important group in western Italy. A few brief points may be made concerning Daunian involvement in western Italy. Daunian pottery was exported widely beyond its place of manufacture and is certainly known in western Italy (v. Yntema 1985: figs 210, 221, 234, 278 showing the distribution of Daunian pottery outside its areas of manufacture during various typological phases. It should be noted that fig. 210 refers to all North Apulian painted pottery of the period (before c.620 BC) and is not subdivided into North and South Daunian, whereas figs 221- 234 refer only to South Daunian wares, and fig. 278 refers only to North Daunian wares). The ancient sources testify that the Daunians conquered Suessula and Pithecusae. It is doubtful that they ever ruled Campania, however. In the 5th century, the Daunians and other tribes were part of an army which, under Etruscan leadership, attacked Cumae in 425 BC (Frederiksen 1984: 136). On the other hand, it is unlikely that the Daunians played any rôle during Hannibal's incursions into Italy.</page><page sequence="84">58 Chapter 2 Two Lucanian nestorides with circular patterns 1) Lucanian Type III nestoris, Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, Leiden, 1894/9.1.

One may describe the scene as follows from left to right. The warrior furthest left appears to be non-Greek. His hair is uncovered and he is naked apart from the free-flowing chlamys which is fastened by a brooch under his chin. The warrior is barefooted. He has a long 'antenna' sword in his right hand and is attacking the Greek foot-soldier. His horse has a circle painted onto its right hind-leg. The second mounted warrior is also barefoot but this one wears a loin- cloth and a broad belt. The loin-cloth has two circular discs as decoration. In his right hand he has a long 'antenna' sword and is attacking the unmounted Greek warrior. It is noteworthy that the horse ridden by this warrior is decorated with a swastika motif. The Greek warrior is shown in combat pose to the left. He is attacking the mounted warrior who wears the loin-cloth. He is naked apart from his free-flowing chlamys. He has an Attic type helmet with frontal-guard and a cheek-piece. He has a spear in his right hand which he uses against his mounted opponent. In his left hand he has a round shield. b) This scene shows the victor and the vanquished. The victor is shown to the left in combat pose. He is Greek in appearance and wears an Attic type crested helmet. He is naked. In his left-hand he has a round shield which permits us an inside view of itself. It is marked with two circles or circular discs each with three short curved lines descending from the lower edge of the circle. In his right hand he has a long 'antenna' sword which he points towards his defeated opponent who lies on the ground. The defeated warrior has a Greek spear in his right hand and a round shield in his left. He is naked apart from the chlamys on his back which is fastened by a brooch under his chin. He is wearing a pair of sandals. He also sports a Celtic helmet with a slightly pointed cap and a small knob on top. The helmet has a frontal-guard and a cheek-piece, although the latter is not clearly visible. Choephoroi Painter.

CLXXI, no. 586).</page><page sequence="85">The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 59 Almost all the men who are shown naked on the two vases discussed above, would give the impression of being Greek were it not for their non-Greek accoutrements, e.g. the long 'antenna' sword, circular and other symbols, and the Celtic helmet. The long sword was known in Europe from the 7th century onwards and apparently survived until the 4th century at least. The so-called Celtic helmet altered its shape over the course of time. Seemingly it was known in Adriatic areas and was adopted by the Central European Celts who brought the helmet down into Italy, over the Alps, in the 5th century BC during one of the wide-scale, prolonged invasions (Stary 1979a: 198-9). This does not mean, however, that the defeated warrior, shown on the nestoris described, above has to be a Celt. In fact, Celtic warriors may have looked rather different from this (for example if the terracotta figurine, from Vetulonia, with a helmet and shield represents a Celt; Stary 1979a: pl. 20)a. In terms of the continued use of tribal symbols, (if they may be interpreted as such) the triangular pattern of three discs with the apex at the bottom is the only one which can be identified as having been used by the Celts of the 4th century BC. The relationship between the Celtic symbol and the Samnite triple-plate cuirass The triangular pattern of three circles with the apex at the bottom occurs on Daunian stelai and Messapian vases, although rarely; see, for example, the stele shown on plate 95, figs 48 &amp; 49 (fig. 48 shows Nava 1980: pl. CCXXXVIII, no. 736 A, where other 'tribal marks' are also shown on horses; fig. 49 shows the shoulder of the stele illustrated in Nava 1980: CXCVI, no. 620 B, here plate 95) and the vase shown in fig. 50 (Yntema 1985: 82, fig. 141). When and why the Celts took up the pattern as a tribal symbol we do not, as yet, know. However, we can trace the archaeological and historical background to the Samnites' adoption of the symbol in their characteristic cuirass. For it is the Celtic tribal symbol which we see, on a larger scale, coming to form the triple-plate Samnite cuirass. Both the Celtic symbol and the Samnite cuirass have the same pattern of two discs side by side and a third disc in the middle beneath them. We find the Celtic symbol on objects for domestic use as well as applied to armour. V L UBOOOP j •)) &lt;§KJ §®l|ļl@X5 ® (§) Fig. 48 Detail from a Daunian stele, based on Nava 1980: pl.

The incision shows a figure of a warrior shown blowing a large almost circular trumpet-like instrument said to have originated from Etruria (Stary 1979a: 195; 198). The same type of trumpet is seen being played by a warrior in a phalanx on an Etruscan black-figure amphora (Stary 1979a: pl. 25a).

Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 62, pl. 66. Photograph courtesy of the Museo Nazionale, Ancona. For this helmet cf. Gh. 2, 2. It is remarkable that this type of cheek-guard was in use for a relatively short period of the 5th/4th century when the Central European Celts adapted this type of helmet which is said to have had a long period of development in shape in other areas (Stary 1979a: 198-9). Eventually the cheek-guard with the Celtic symbol was replaced by the long-lasting Graeco-Etruscan type (Stary 1979a: 200; this type of helmet is represented on the handle attachment of a bronze vase which is decorated with fighting warriors (Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 107, pl. 120 dated to the 6th/5th century BC. cf. also Stary 1979b). Historical evidence for links between the Celts and the Samnites According to Livy (X.21ff.) (Stary 1979a: 198-9) the Celts and the Samnites became allies after 386 BC, when the Celts had failed to capture Rome because the sacred geese of the Capitoline had woken the Roman soldiers in time. However, it is beyond the scope of this work to enter the debate on when precisely the Celts and the Samnites began to fight the Romans or to suggest when their alliance was dissolved (v. Stary 1979b). It is possible that the alliance lasted longer than the whole period of existence of the patterned cheek-guard on the Celtic helmet (i.e. those with the pattern of three circles arranged to form a triangle). The Samnite cuirass, on the other hand, seems to have been in use at least until the beginning of the 3rd century BC (v. the bronze statuette of a Samnite warrior discussed below). However, there is no literary or archaeological evidence to show whether the Samnite triple-plate cuirass was in use during the Celto-Samnite alliance against Rome. Clearly, when it was in use, it was much favoured by Samnite warriors of high social standing. This is demonstrated by the frequency of representations of its use on Campanian vases. The bronze statuette of a Samnite warrior suggesting links between the Samnites and the Celts Bronze statuette from Sicily, Louvre Br-124. Plate 70a&amp; b. Photograph courtesy of the Musée du Louvre. There survives a bronze statuette of a Samnite warrior (height 29 cm) which has been published on more than one occasion. It is said to have been found in Sicily. Traditionally it was been dated to the 5th century BC but more recently this has been revised to give a 3rd century date (De Ridder 1913: 25, no. 124; Breglia 1942: 37-8, pl. XIII giving a 5th-4th century BC date; Stary 1979a: pl. 22a; Bianchi Bandinelli &amp; Giuliano 1973: 250, pis 287 &amp; 288 giving a 4th-3rd century BC date).</page><page sequence="88">62 Chapter 2 This date and the fact that it was found in Sicily might be both acceptable and compatible as the Samnites are known to have served as mercenaries in many countries including Sicily in the 3rd century BC, as their power in mainland Italy was declining. The warrior stands on an oblong, sharply profiled base in Polykleitan stance. He is fully equipped with a tunic, triple-plate cuirass, greaves and a helmet (cf. Ch. 2, 2). His shield and spear are missing. This well preserved figure gives us some precise details on the Samnites and their armament. This statuette presents us with a view of the Samnite warrior which is unique and different from those on vase- and tomb-paintings. The closeness to the Celts is accentuated by the fact that he wears a Celtic helmet. Tribal identity is indicated by 'racial' features of the face. The helmet might be datable by its shape. It has a pointed cap and does not have a knob on top. The plastic ridges indicate it was made according to an old technique by which separate pieces of bronze are joined together (Stary 1979a: 191). The racial features of the face on this terracotta are different from those usually representations of Italiote features seen on vase- and tomb-painting. The face of this statuette recalls that of the Capestrano warrior and those of the heads of the Daunian stelai which are often found separate from the stelai themselves. The nose on this statuette is straight and quite long and comes to a sharp point. The eyes are rather round and close to the nose. The mouth is thin and indicated by a long line like those of the earlier statues (e.g. the Capestrano warrior and the Daunian stelai) although the style had been altered by the 4th century BC. One may note that indicating racial characteristics was an old artistic tradition. The earliest examples occur on Hittite reliefs of the 2nd millennium (Akurgal &amp; Hirmer 1962: 58, fig. 43 (showing a straight pointed nose, 15th century BC); 109, figs 64 &amp; 65 (showing an 'idealised' nose, 14th century BC); 109, fig. 68 (showing a sphinx with a 'hooked end' nose); 139-40, fig. 140 (showing a thick nose with rounded end, 8th century BC). These examples are followed by the above mentioned monuments of the late 7th, 6th and 5th centuries BC as well as the bronze situlae from south-eastern Europe and the Este area which have also been described earlier (for bronze situlae v. Kastelic 1965: figs 18-20 showing straight noses on both sexes from the Certosa situla; figs 60 &amp; 67 show plump round noses on the Kaffarn situla and the Vace clasp; for different facial characteristics on Daunian stelai see, for example Nava 1980: pis CCXCVIII, no. 889 A &amp; CCCXVI, no. 950 A). Representations of facial features in profile makes various types recognisable. However, it is not possible to identify these tribes or races by name. 4 The Greaves That the Samnite warriors protected their legs with greaves (j knemides ), as the Greeks did, is made evident by surviving bronze examples and by the representations found on Campanian vases and on tomb-paintings. The latter are of particular interest because some of them are reported to have been painted in a golden colour with red details forming the internal design. In one case a golden greave hangs as a trophy on the spear of a homecoming warrior (for gold greaves v. Weege 1909: 105, no. 8; 107, no. 14). Livy (IX.40.3; v. sup. p.50) implies that the Samnite soldier wore a greave on the left leg only. Modern scholarship would dispute this. We have enough representations showing Samnites wearing a pair of greaves to suggest this was not the case (v. below). In any case it seems implausible to suppose that the Samnites used greaves on the left leg only (although this may later have become the practice of some gladiators) on the grounds that the right leg could be protected by their large shield, (v. Weege 1909: 152-4 on greaves on the left leg). Greek and Samnite greaves covered the knee and reached down to the ankle. One may suppose that they were custom-made for the owner, fitting the individual shape of his legs.</page><page sequence="89">The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 63 Moreover, they were clearly made in different shapes for the right and left legs (plate 98a). The knee was specially modelled and the edges of the greave follow the curving outline of the individual's calf. The extent to which the calves themselves were covered can be seen in plate 98b. (Photographs courtesy of the Archäologisches Institut, Zürich). Artistic representations suggest that the Greeks and Samnites adopted different methods of putting on their greaves. The Samnite is shown resting his leg on a rock to support it while he tests the fit of the greave by putting both hands round the middle of it (plate 99). This scene is on a bail amphora (Naples RC 74) ascribed to the Three-Dot Group ( LCS (2/356), p. 278, pl. 1 13.2; cf. here Ch. 3, 2). The Greek, on the other hand, did not support his leg but merely kept it raised while he tested the fit by putting both hands above the knee. Behind his leg hang two fairly short straps with small knobs at their ends. These may have been tied as a finishing touch (plate 100). This is shown on a hydria (Rome, Museo Capitolino, 88) ascribed to the Group of the Antimenes Painter (Beazley, ABV (1956), p. 270, no. 66; Lissarrague 1984: 43, fig. 64). (Photograph courtesy of the Museo Capitolino, Rome). However, there are relatively few pictures showing Samnite warriors wearing greaves in combat situations (for some exceptions v. Ch. 3, 3, nos la, le, IVb). Like the cuirass, it seems that greaves were worn on certain ritual occasions; as shown in libation and funerary scenes (v. Ch. 6, 2, nos 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and Addendum; Ch. 6, 3, nos le, le, and Ile; Ch. 6, 4, no. Ia). On the other hand, there are pictures showing the so-called 'mock-fights' where the combatants wear greaves (v. Ch. 3, 4, nos 3, 5, 8 and the Capuan tomb-painting shown in plate 101 discussed in the same section). In other cases the legs were unprotected and the shins could suffer spear wounds. 5 The Single Spur Although some literary sources tell us that spurs were used by Greek horsemen in the 5th century BC, there are neither archaeological finds nor representations in contemporary Greek art to confirm this (Anderson 1978: 46-8). Greek influence may be assumed on the non-Greek Apulian, Campanian and Paestan warriors despite the poverty of the Greek evidence. The non-Greek warriors wore a single spur on their left ankles. On a volute krater by the Arpi Painter we can see a non-Greek warrior standing beside his horse and wearing a spur on his left ankle; his right ankle is bare (plate 79 below). This Fig. 5 1 Single spur worn by an Apulian Samnite, after volute krater, Tampa, 87.36 Fig. 52 One of a pair of spurs worn by a boy riding a race horse, after bronze statue, National Museum Athens</page><page sequence="90">64 Chapter 2 vase is now in Tampa Museum and was once on the Basel and later the London markets. Some Capuan and Paestan tomb-paintings are recorded as showing mounted warriors in profile with their left side showing. They wear a spur on their left ankle but as their right ankles are not visible one cannot draw conclusions from this. There are also some South Italian red-figure vases where this is also the case. According to the descriptions by Weege (1909) and Anderson (1978) the attachment of the spur is the same in all cases. On the Tampa vase we see a broad red band with white draw-straps encircling it out of which a small spur in the shape of a pin projects (fig. 51). Weege recorded on two Campanian tomb-paintings a dark brown spur band with strings around it and a black spur projecting from it. Weege only mentions one Capuan example (here plate 47) (Weege 1909: 103-4, no. 6, pl. 8), and a single Paestan example (Weege 1909: 1 16-7, no. 30) where two of the scenes show a warrior with a spur (v. below).

On his lance hangs a belt as a trophy. In the same tomb, on another wall a bearded rider is depicted wearing a white tunic with a red wave pattern, a broad belt and a spur band. In both cases the right ankles of the horsemen are not visible. Weege 1909: 116-7, no. 30. The wearing of two spurs It is only in the Hellenistic period that it becomes clear that two spurs were worn. As an example one may quote the bronze statue of a young boy riding a race horse now in the National Museum at Athens which is dated to the late 2nd/early 1st century BC (Fuchs 1979: 142, figs 134 &amp; 135; Robertson 1975: 558-9, pl. 177c). Not only were two spurs worn but it also seems that they were attached in a slightly different way in the Hellenistic period from the 4th century BC examples (fig. 52).</page><page sequence="91">The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 65 6 The Shield Introduction Of all the different types of shield, the round shield was the most popular in the time of the Samnites. It was not only the Samnites who preferred it, however. Recent research has shown that the round shield was imported, along with a range of other objects, from the 7th/6th century onwards, from the Near East to South Italy. It first appeared at various places along Italy's east coast from whence it spread widely over Europe (Stary 1979a: 191). In vase-painting the shield is normally shown in profile so we can see its somewhat convex form and gain some idea of its exterior decoration (showing patterns such as, a star, a wild animal, a demon's face, etc.) (fig. 53). When shown face on we can see that the decoration covered the whole exterior surface; as it does, for example, on the relatively large shield shown on a skyphos attributed to the Ixion Group (plate 56a, discussed in greater detail below). The pattern on the shield is a star, the points of which almost reached the edge of the shield. It seems that this sort of composition was much in favour at the time as was applied to various objects (e.g. Borell- Siedel 1980: pl. 12.6; Lorenz 1980: pl. 29, 1-2). Pictures showing the inside of the shield reveal how they were carried. The shield has two straps. One runs vertically over the middle of the inside of the shield and was probably made of leather. It is decorated with geometric patterns except in the centre where the left arm passed under it (fig. 54a &amp; b). The second strap is thinner and runs vertically close to the edge of the shield. This strap was held in the left hand to give the warrior a firm grip and steady control of his shield. Also noteworthy are some small circles with short lines hanging down from them which are shown on the inside of some round shield. These patterns are reminiscent of those seen on the Lucanian Type II nestoris and interpreted as a tribal symbol (plate 28b; cf. the discussion on tribal smbols in Ch. 2, 3). Although the system of applying straps to the inside of the shield is a simple invention, there were some variations depending on the shape of the shield. For example, the pelta carried by the Amazons with its unique almost semi-circular shape and short diameter has short plain straps which do not reach the edge of the shield. In this case the strap for the arm is attached horizontally, while the other, for the left hand, is attached vertically. Thus the arm has to bend straight upwards when carrying this type of shield as opposed to bending it more or less at a right angle when holding a round shield (fig. 55a &amp; b).

This type of pattern may have been done in relief. There are no known pictures showing the inside of this type of shield. This type of shield was used by young Samnite warriors in combat (fig. 56). Weege (1909: 144) calls the dots 'Gerstenkörner'. 2) The so-called 'parasol' shield. Its shape recalls an ancient parasol and indeed similar types of sunshade are still in use to this day (fig. 57). The shape is somewhat concave. The surface consisted of thin metal. Artistic representations suggest that the metal frame was covered by some sort of fabric. Although no such example survives today, one which has lost its cover is now preserved in the museum at Campobasso (Weege 1909: 144). The Oval Shield There are also a few representations of Samnite warriors who carry a shield which is not round. This shield is roughly oval in shape although the ends are rather more pointed. This type might have been made of bronze with incised decoration. It may well have been fashioned like the above. Representations of this type of shield show two parallel lines run from the top point to the bottom one (e.g. fig. 58). In the middle they are each interrupted by a curving line after which the two lines run parallel again. The rim does not seem to be decorated. No picture of the inside of such a shield survives nor do any showing such a shield being used in combat.

Perhaps it was the colourful Samnite parasol shields and white linen corselets which the Roman saw when he was sent to spy on the Samnite forces ranged against the Roman army at Aquilonia in 293 BC. The corselets are discussed in CH. 2, 3. It may also be interesting to consider briefly the representation of ancient parasols. A typical example can be found in: Plate 104, Fig. 59.

In the latter case the points at the two ends are less sharp and it is made of wood. For the oval shield v. Stary 1979a: 200. Conclusions It was the Samnite hoplites who carried a shield. They seem to have preferred a round shield of bronze with embossed decoration. They are rarely seen with other types of shield. This round shield seems to have been widely popular at the time. It is evident that horsemen were not accustomed to carrying shields. When mounted the horse's reins are held in the left hand and even when a horseman has left his mount he usually has only a spear and no shield (e.g. v. the Apulian horseman on plate 103). However, there may be an exceptional case depicted on the short side of a Paestan sarcophagus. It appears to show a man on horseback with part of a shield at his left shoulder. However the sarcophagus is badly preserved and so one cannot be absolutely certain of the content of the scene portrayed on it (plate 63, cf. Ch. 2, 1). Another exceptional case from vase-painting, showing a mounted warrior with a shield is shown on the hydria (Budapest T 763) by the LNO Painter (plate 3). The Offensive Equipment: Samnite Weapons 7 The Spear A complete Samnite spear has not yet been found despite the fact that there must have been an extremely large number of them in ancient South Italy. At first sight the 4th century vase-paintings give the impression that most warriors carried spears. Frequently Samnite warriors are shown with two spears. Sometimes, however, a young warrior did not carry a spear; v., for example, the bail amphora (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 1880.17 (V 457)) ascribed to the Libation Group (plate 106; cf. Ch. 3, 5). Vase-paintings are also an invaluable source for the representations of other types of Samnite weaponry even though these are portrayed only rarely (e.g. the Lucanian Type II nestoris, once on the Rome market, by the Choephoroi Painter where the 'antenna' sword and the javelin are depicted in a combat scene (plate 28a &amp; b). The vase is discussed above in Ch. 1, 2, Ch. 2, 2, and Ch. 2, 3; and below in Ch. 2, 9). Despite the fact that no complete example survives we can attempt to reconstruct the Samnite spear. This is because Samnite spear-heads and chapes are found, fairly frequently, over a wide area of South Italy. 2 v. note 3 in Ch. 1, 2, p. 7. E.H.</page><page sequence="96">70 Chapter 2 Samnite spear-heads Samnite spear-heads have been found in excavated tombs. They date to the Late Geometric period and have been found, for example, at Alfedena in the Abruzzi, at Picenum and in other places in that area. (The 'antenna' sword has been found in the same broad area. cf. the Capestrano warrior, in the Chieti museum, discussed in Ch. 2, 3, plate 81a &amp; b). Places like Novilara, Samnium and Pontecagnano are other find-spots. The spear-heads are mostly made of bronze, although occasionally they were tipped with iron. Spear-heads made entirely of iron are rare (Saulnier 1983: 27). A spear-head consists of an upper and lower part. The upper part is the spear-point proper, while the lower part consists of a tube (of various kinds) which served to hold the end of the wooden shaft. The shaft could be fastened to the spear-head by various means. Sometimes on the reverse or on the front of the lower part of the spear-head we see a small hole which would have had a nail driven through it and into the wooden shaft (e.g. fig. 61 below; Saulnier 1983: 29-30, nos 2 &amp; 8). It should also be remembered that spears were used in much later periods, for example, by Hannibal's army when they crossed the Alps and came down into South Italy, and also by the Roman army when they advanced north of the Alps in the years immediately before and shortly after the end of the 1st millennium BC. Examples of spear-heads dated to the Late Geometric period Fig. 60. Torre Galli, Tomb 30. Length 28 cm. Made of bronze. The upper part has an oval shape with two parallel lines incised from the sharp tip down to the lower part. The lower part is a tube with three groups of incised parallel lines running round it.

Weege appears to have seen it on some tomb-paintings and refers to it as 'Wurfriemen' (Weege 1909: 117 &amp; 157). However, he does not describe it fully and the paintings, on which he may have seen such a thing, have since been destroyed. No similar feature is depicted on any of the surviving pictures. We can only suggest that if such a feature existed it was hidden by the warrior's hand both when he held his spear</page><page sequence="99">The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 73 upright and when it was being thrown at an enemy. These are the two ways in which a warrior is shown holding a spear. The suggestion that there was a strap attached to the spear, is supported by the recent practice of attaching a strap of leather to a javelin when thrown in certain sporting events. The ancient 'Wurfriemen' was probably made of leather and probably served to improve the leverage a warrior's could achieve while throwing the spear and thus enhance the power of his throw. 8 The Javelin The javelin basically looks like a short spear. It is used for attacking the enemy at close range. If the enemy is very close it can be used in hand-to-hand combat and not thrown at all, but it can also be used over greater distances by throwing. There is one example where the javelin has feathers at its end. Why it should be decorated in this way we cannot say (v. below). Three representations of the javelin a) Neck amphora, Brussels A 3550. Plate 26a. The scene shows an assault by Samnite foot-soldiers on a group of possibly Roman foot-soldiers. The latter group are shown seated or semi-recumbent and offer no resistance.

For this vase cf. Ch. 2, 1 and Ch. 2, 3. 9 The Sword The iconographie record associates the Samnites with two types of sword. The first is the long, 'antenna' sword, while the second is a short sword which has its origins in the Near East. However, the evidence from vase and tomb-painting suggests that spears were the favoured weapon of the Samnites with swords appearing relatively rarely. The 'Antenna' Sword The long or 'antenna' sword was known in Europe from the 7th century onwards and apparently survived until the 4th century at least. However, few representations survive</page><page sequence="100">74 Chapter 2 directly associating the Samnites and other native tribes with the 'antenna' sword, and even these are not entirely unambiguous (v. the Lucanian Type II nestoris described below). From the first example cited below, it seems the 'antenna' sword could be used by both horsemen and foot-soldiers. Plate 28a &amp; b. Lucanian Type II nestoris. Once on the Rome market, whereabouts now unknown. 'Antenna' swords are shown in use by a number of warriors is this combat scene from the neck of the vase. Plate 28a shows two mounted warriors carrying these swords. One of these warriors is naked apart from his chlamys while the other wears a loin-cloth. Their tribal identity is indicated by the symbols painted on the hind-quarters of their horses, and by the second warrior's loin-cloth. Further round the neck of the vase (plate 28b) a naked foot-soldier is shown using an antenna sword against his defeated opponent. The victor wears an Attic type crested helmet and his general appearance is Greek. He carries a round shield on his left arm, the inside of which is marked with two circles or circular discs each with three short curved lines radiating from the lower edge of the circle. His defeated opponent is naked apart from his chlamys and Celtic helmet. He carries a spear and a round shield. The tribal identity of these two warriors is more ambiguous, but both bear enough elements (e.g. the 'antenna' sword and the Celtic helmet) to suggest that they are not Greek. All of the long swords depicted on this vase have elaborate hilts. Choephoroi Painter. LCS (633), p. 123, (no ill. of neck); pl. 61.6 shows the body of the vase.

Statue of a warrior from Capestrano, Museo Nazionale, Chieti. Plate 81a &amp; b. The Capestrano warrior statue is notable for the warrior's costume and armament. The costume is distinguished by the large stiff hat and the heart-protector, while his armament consists of a long 'antenna' sword which is held across the front of the chest. The sword has an elaborate hilt, of a different type from that depicted on the nestoris described above.

The Short Sword According to modern research the short sword came to be known in South Italy in the 7th/6th century BC as part of a group of arms and other objects which were imported from the Near East (Stary 1979a: 186-7; cf. here Ch. 2, 3). Just as with the long sword, there are reatively few representations directly associating the short sword with the Samnites. Lucanian Type I nestoris, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 1971.49. Plate 6. Fig. 67. A seated warrior is shown receiving a short sword from a woman. The warrior wears a tunic decorated a pattern of with vertical lines and a high pilos.

While the Near Eastern short sword is said to have been double-edged those known from South Italy are not. The young warrior depicted on the nestoris described above is undoubtedly a Samnite. Thus it is clear, that the Samnites did have the short sword as part of their armoury. The scene itself may perhaps be interpreted as a ritual in which a warrior</page><page sequence="101">The Samnite Warrior's Equipment 75 Fig. 67 Short sword presented to a Samnite warrior, after Type I Lucanian nestoris, Boston 1971.49 was awarded a piece of equipment he had not previously possessed (or had the right to carry). This is similar to the other types of presentation mentioned earlier (for example, the presentation of helmets, cf. above Ch. 2, 1). In this scene the warrior is seated on a rock. Although he is already armed with a shield and spear, he bends forward and stretches his arm out to take the short sword giving the impression that he is eager to receive it. The woman seems to be rushing to give it to him. The short sword itself is protected by a sheath. One can imagine how this sword may have been carried when not in use by the way it is represented. A long strap fastened to the hilt of the sword could perhaps have run diagonally across the chest and back and been thrown over the shoulder. (This arrangement is suggested by the wall-painting illustrated in Connolly 1978: 25, no. 7). Alternatively, a strap could have been put through the ring which is shown under the hilt on both the right and left side of the sword. This strap could then have been fastened to the warrior's body. (Connolly 1978: 40, no. 5 shows a reconstruction of Samnite armour with the sword worn in this way), v. also the votive sword with two rings on the same side of the hilt (Tronchetti 1988: 68, fig. 3). It is remarkable that the nestoris mentioned above shows almost the only picture of a Samnite with a short sword. Up to now, the only other scene possibly associating the Samnites with the short sword is on a Lucanian Type II nestoris (Berlin F 3 146) ascribed to the Painter of Naples 1959 (plate 94b. v. LCS (854), p. 150, (no ill.); cf. here Ch. 2, 6. Photograph courtesy of the Staatliche Museen, Berlin). On this latter vase a short sword is used in combat by a young foot-soldier. However, the identification of this warrior as a Samnite is dubious because although he carries the typical Samnite parasol shield he is naked, and therefore does not wear the obligatory Samnite tunic. The scene itself is interesting because the three warriors shown on it are probably of different origin and use three different types of weapon. One warrior has been described above as displaying some of the attributes of a Samnite. The second who is naked apart from his free-flowing chlamys is armed with a spear and round shield. He can perhaps be identified as a colonial Greek. The third warrior is probably an Amazon. She is armed with an axe which is also thought to have developed from the pelstaves which were probably imported from the Near East in the 7th/6th century BC. (cf. Ch. 2, 3; Stary 1979a: 184). While there are so few scenes showing the short sword in use in real life, there are, by contrast, considerable numbers of 4th century South Italian vases with mythological scenes of murder on them on which the short sword is often shown as potential murder weapon. The following three examples will suffice: 1) Paestan neck amphora, Naples 1779. Polyxena is about to be murdered by Neoptolemos. Painter of Naples 1778. PP , no. 327, p. 94, pl. XXXIVd. RVP (3/16), p. 272, pl. 168a.</page><page sequence="102">76 Chapter 2 2) Paestan calyx krater, Tampa, Florida, Zewadski coll. Orestes at Delphi.

Schneider-Herrmann 1975b: 271-2, fig. 15; RVAp I (16/7), p. 416, pl. 148.4. These and other examples provide strong supporting evidence for the short sword being a familiar weapon in South Italy during the 4th century BC.</page><page sequence="103">Chapter 3 The Samnite Warrior's Activities The Samnite warrior's activities, as depicted in vase-painting, can be divided into two broad categories. These are combat-related activities, which include training and maintenance of equipment, as well as combat proper, and ritual activities. This latter category can be subdivided into rituals involving single warriors which are dealt with in this part of the book (cf. below Ch. 3, 5) and those involving groups of warriors (such as some of the funerary scenes in Ch. 6, 4) or warriors and women together (see, for example, Ch. 6, 2, Ch. 6, 3 and some of the funerary scenes in Ch. 6, 4) which are dealt with in Chapter 6 - Ritual Activities Common to both Warriors and Women. Needless to say, Samnite men must have engaged in a wider range of activities than are depicted in the iconographie record, but vase-painting provides a strong flavour of the aspects of their lives which are covered. Tomb-paintings slightly broaden our picture of the lives of Samnite men by showing them hunting (v. Napoli 1970a: 62, pl. 101) and chariot-racing (v. Napoli 1970a: 63, pl. 103). The Samnite Warrior's Combat Related Activities 1 Military Training Recent research suggests it is likely that an organised system of military education existed among the Samnites. Based on the Greek system of ephebeia , military exercises, sports and games, like those known from the Greek colonists and the Etruscans, would have been practised. One can argue that paintings showing mounted warriors as disciplined and distinguished provide circumstantial support for this view, e.g. the Paestan tomb-painting shown in plate 1 1 1 (Napoli 1970d: pl. 34). Although no literary sources are available, some images of young horsemen standing alongside their horses can give us an idea of the native ephebe. They appear relaxed in an almost sculptural pose holding the reins loosely. They have one or two spears in their hands or leaning against their shoulders. Whether specific variations in the detailed elements of their clothing or armour indicate a special or particular stage in the career of the young warrior is difficult to say.</page><page sequence="104">78 Chapter 3 Examples of ephebes from different groups beside their horses. 1) Calyx krater, Chicago National History Museum, 27680.

RVAp II (3/84), p. 73 7, (no ill.). Photograph courtesy of the trustees of the British Museum. For this vase cf. Ch. 1, 5. The scenes on these vases have much in common with others showing single warriors without ritual associations (some of these scenes are discussed below in Ch. 3, 5). They also show that from an early stage in their training young native warriors were relaxed in the handling of horses. This ties in well with the historical accounts of the prowess of the Samnite cavalry. Scenes of young hoplites training It seems likely that some vases, ascribed to the Ixion Painter or at least in the manner of the Ixion Painter, showing single representations of young hoplites, are, in fact, scenes depicting military training, such as walking, marching and running in armour. Although all are depicted in an almost identical way one cannot be sure they represent the same person. Only three are clearly wearing a tunic and belt while the bodies of two are completely covered by their large shields leaving only the head and legs visible. The position of the legs and feet determines whether the figure is considered to be moving or stationary. The warrior on the skyphos in Naples, private collection 1-8-6, is shown running carrying his large shield; he does not have a spear however. The others seem to be standing in a way that would be unstable, judging by the position of their feet, if they were not leaning on a spear. This notwithstanding, there is one clear way in which a difference in military rank may be indicated. The three with the highly ornate shield may be presumed to be of a higher rank than the two with plain white shields, particularly the warrior with the plump, squarish body, who wears a heart-protector. In fact, differences in military rank can be assumed to have existed as early as the 7th century BC because of the evidence from the so-called Chigi jug, now in the Villa Giulia Museum. This vessel shows a single hoplite using a trumpet to give orders to others in the formation of a phalanx (Beazley, Jacobstahl &amp; Payne 1933: 23, pis 27-9).</page><page sequence="105">The Samnite Warrior's Activities 79 Vases with examples of young foot soldiers training , ascribed to the Ixion Group Skyphos, Naples, priv. coll., 1-8-6.

LCS Suppl. Ill , (2/822g), p. 160, pl. XVIII.2. For this vase cf. Ch. 1, 5 While it is not absolutely certain that these representations depict a system of organised military education, they do certainly give the impression of young warriors honing their military skills. It is interesting that these young warriors do not yet wear the full Samnite panoply. Elsewhere we have examined scenes which appear to show the ritual awarding of a piece of equipment to a young warrior (cf. Ch. 2, 1 and Ch. 2, 9). Whatever the exact status of these scenes, it seems clear that for the Samnites it was important for boys and adolescents to aspire to warrior status. A good illustration of this is provided by the neck amphora by the LNO Painter (Liefkes collection, The Hague) where a young Samnite boy is kitted out in the same way as his father whom he rides alongside. Both father and son have trophies on the spears and they seem to be returning from combat (plate 4) ( LCS (4/291), p. 481, pl. 185.9; Byvanck-Quarles van Ufford 1975: no. 587, pl. 239. cf. here ASPECTS OF SAMNITE LIFE (in Author's Notes), Ch. 1, 5, Ch. 5, 2 and Ch. 6, 3, no. Ile). 2 Preparing for Combat One of the warrior's most necessary pastimes must have been the maintenance of his equipment in readiness for warfare. Surprisingly we have, to date, only one scene showing a warrior engaged in such activities. However, it does provide some useful information.</page><page sequence="106">80 Chapter 3 Bail amphora, once Zürich market, Altstadt Galerie. Plate 108. A warrior is shown seated on a rock. He is wearing a feathered helmet, a tunic and greaves. He holds his spear across his knees in both hands. With his right hand he checks the condition of his spear. Whether he is checking that the spear-head is securely fastened to the wooden shaft so as to be sure of its strength in battle or whether he is testing the sharpness of the spear-head we cannot be certain. His round shield is shown resting on the left side of the rock. Painter of Louvre K 49 1 . LCS Suppl. II (2/3 9a), p. 188, pl. XXXIV 2. For this vase cf. Ch. 2, 7. Another important activity connected with the preparation for combat was arming; however, this is not a common subject on vase-painting. The bail amphora (Naples RC 74) ascribed to the Three-Dot Group showing a Samnite putting on his greaves provides one example of this type of scene (plate 99) ( LCS (2/356), p. 278, pl. 1 13.2; cf. here Ch. 2, 4). There is a small number of scenes showing a warrior arming which have a ritual overtone and are related to the libation scenes in that a woman is present making an offering (for an example of this v. the squat lekythos (Louvre K 365) connected with the Painter of BM F196 and the Capua-Boreas Painter ( LCS (3/260), p. 396, pl. 154.1). The bell krater by the Detroit Painter shown in plate 19 (BM 1953 4-29.1) is another example of a warrior putting on greaves at a ritual occasion ( LCS (3/295), p. 403, (no ill.), cf. here Ch. 1, 2 and APPENDIX). The psychological preparation for warfare cannot in itself be a subject for vase-painting, however, the rituals connected with the cult of the single warrior seem likely to have been concerned either with the preparation for battle or with thanksgiving on the successful return from battle (cf. Ch. 3, 5). Similarly the libation scenes, where a woman offers a ritual drink to a departing or returning warrior, must have served the same purpose (cf. Ch. 6, 3). 3 Combat The literary sources and the vase-paintings tell us that combat was an important part of Samnite life. We know that there was a considerable number of tribes but we know next to nothing about them except that they existed. They are supposed to have come from the north and the east to settle in the fertile plains of South Italy. Combat is supposed to have gone on between the various tribes as well as within the tribes themselves. Conflict between the native and the Greek population was another feature of life in South Italy at the time. The Samnites must have devoted a great deal of time and attention to keeping themselves ready for warfare; whether as act of aggression or for defensive reasons. We know of their careful stewardship of horses and clearly riding was a skill acquired at an early age (v. plates 2 and 4, cf. ASPECTS OF SAMNITE LIFE (in Author's Notes)). (For checking equipment v. plate 108, Ch. 3, 2 and for training to run in full armour v. plate 55, Ch. 3, 1). There is a group of five vases which each show a single Samnite foot-soldier in a different combat pose. These are as follows: giving a command; advancing cautiously; aggressive use of the spear; defensive use of the spear; throwing a stone. Most vases show combat between two warriors. To date there are only two vases known showing large scale battles with Samnite foot-soldiers. However, this can only reflect vase-painting conventions rather than any real military phenomenon. Furthermore, it is not always clear who is fighting whom. It is not always possible to determine with certainty a warrior's tribal identity from the equipment he uses. Moreover, there is a group of vases with amusing scenes of the kind of 'mock-fight' which was popular in Capua and elsewhere in South Italy. On some we see a supervisor stopping the contest before it gets out of hand and becomes serious.</page><page sequence="107">The Samnite Warrior's Activities 8 1 Examples of combat scenes I Single foot-soldiers in combat poses la) Skyphos, University of California, Berkeley 8/3243.

Their captors are two horsemen also shown naked. Each has a tunic hanging from his spear as a trophy. The prisoners are tied to the reins near the horses' mouths. They walk in front of the horses. One prisoner is shown in profile view and the other in rear view. The figures seem to be making a slow trek home. Some details are picked out in solid black. One horseman has a well groomed beard but the other is younger. Both ride white horses. All four figures have their hair uncovered and wear black shoes which resemble modern socks. Also noteworthy are the vertical double black palmettes on the neck of the vessel which are known in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. The amphora is said to have been found at Chiusi, cf. also two other vases in outline technique: an olpe from Cumae, now in Naples and a pelike from Capua, now Boston 10.8084 (Beazley 1947: 295, note to p. 12). Both can be dated to the end of the 6th century BC. However, the style of the figures and particularly of the tunics used as trophies suggests that this amphora may date from 400 BC or somewhat later. Given this information the pattern beneath the two handles is of special interest. It reminds one of the Celtic symbol which is found on various domestic and other objects (cf. for example plates 95-97 discussed in Ch. 2, 3). However, the execution of this type of pattern is more elaborated here. VIE II, (AB 14), p. 273, fig. 37; Frederiksen 1968: figs 4 &amp; 5; Weege 1909: 136-7, fig. 14. For this vase cf. Ch. 1, 5. Addendum A peripheral point is the question why all four figures are naked. It seems likely that there would be separate explanations as to why the prisoners and the horsemen are both nude. In some combat scenes we have seen naked prisoners with their tunics hanging as a trophy from the spears of their captors. Perhaps this is what has happened in this scene and the prisoners are Samnites. It may be their tunics which hang, as trophies, from the spears of the victorious warriors.</page><page sequence="111">The Samnite Warrior's Activities 85 On naked horsemen it might be worth recalling Massimo Pallottino's note that the Gauls used to fight naked (Pallottino 1981: 111). An Etruscan 4th century stone relief from a building in Bologna shows a naked foot soldier armed with a short sword fighting a horseman (Pallottino 1981: pl. Lilla). The horseman who is shown from the back wears a tunic which is somewhat different from the typical Samnite example. Pallottino identifies the hoplite as a Gaul but does not identify the horseman. Stary (1979a: 200, pl. 27a) examines the same relief and suggests that the hoplite is a Celt. 4 The Mock-Fight A certain type of combat, the so-called 'duel', was at least in part a ťmock-fighť although the risk of fatal injury still existed. The term 'duel' is not especially appropriate as sometimes three warriors could be involved in it. Only a few vase-painters seem have concerned themselves with this type of subject and only a small number of such scenes have survived to the modern day. There is a sole candidate for being the earliest known representation of this type of combat; this is by a painter who is related in style to the Parrish Painter and is dated to between 350 and 340 BC. There are no further scenes of this type for a period of approximately 10 years. All the remaining 'duel' scenes can be dated to the period 330-320 BC. List of painters and some typical examples of this type of scene Painter related to the Parrish Painter, 350-340 BC. Plate 1 19. Naples 878/82765. Washington Combat Painter, 330-325 BC. Plate 120. Washington 429913. Plate 121. Capua 7539. Duel Painter, 325-320 BC. Plate 122. Once Munich, Preyss. Plate 123. St Petersburg 1670. Plate 124. Paris, Louvre CA 31906. Plate 125. Budapest, 51.89. Column Painter, 350-320 BC. Plate 126. Bloomington, I.U.A.M. 70.29. Almost all the vases showing scenes of a mock-fight are hydriai and skyphoi; the lebes gamikos shown in plate 126 is an exception. On all vases a pair of warriors are shown in combat pose. They differ greatly from those combat scenes described earlier however in that in this type of scene the figures are broadly symmetrical and wear identical outfits. This latter point even applies when there are three figures on the vase (plate 124). Mostly the figures are naked; although some have their nakedness relieved by a white belt. Others wear a patterned tunic or loin-cloth. They seem to be warriors of low rank as most wear the pilos-shaped helmet. However, there are exceptions, a few wear crested and even decorated helmets (plate 121) and in one case a Phrygian cap is worn (plate 120). Two are shown bare-headed (plates 119 &amp; 122). Normally the combatants are armed with a spear and shield although some carry a sword. It is clear that the eight vases, in some sense, form a separate group. The symmetrical composition indicates some special form of battle. One of the scenes showing very individualistic behaviour makes it clear that the scene we are observing is in some way comic (plate 126). On this vase the duel is over and victor has used a trick. He has held his shield between his and his opponent's face, so that they cannot see each other. Instead, both look at</page><page sequence="112">86 Chapter 3 the shield. The victor's spear rests unused against his right shoulder but his opponent, the right hand figure, cannot direct his spear because of the trick with the shield. While this scene shows the end of a duel, another seems to show the beginning of one. Two warriors stand motionless facing each other (plate 119). This gives the impression that the fight is perhaps only just about to begin. The other scenes show decisive moments during the fight when both warriors have reached a stalemate and the duel comes to an end. Eight vases showing duels 1) Skyphos, Naples 878/82765. Plate 1 19. This scene shows the start of a duel. Both warriors stand motionless, facing each other. Both wear patterned tunics. The right hand warrior has a round shield with a star pattern (cf. Ch. 2, 6.). He is bare-headed. The left-hand warrior has a plain round shield and a pilos-type helmet with a crest. Both are armed with spears. Parrish Painter. LCS (2/180), p. 253, pl. 101.2. Photograph courtesy of the Museo Nazionale, Naples. 2) Skyphos, once Munich Market, Preyss. Plate 122. Neither warrior is victorious. The two warriors stand opposed. The right-hand one is shown in frontal three-quarter view and the left hand one is shown in rear three- quarter view. Both are naked. The right hand warrior is bare-headed while his opponent wears a pilos-type helmet. Both stand with swords raised, seemingly unable to attack. They seem to dance rather than fight. Duel Painter. LCS (2/759), p. 329, pl. 129.7. 3) Skyphos, St Petersburg, inv. 1670. Plate 123. Neither warrior is shown victorious. Both warriors are virtually nude. Each wears a pilos and a piece of free-flowing drapery. They try to hit each other beneath their shields which have clashed. Their heads are above the shields so that neither can see what he is doing. Duel Painter. LCS (2/758), p. 329, pl. 129.6.

The left hand warrior is naked except for his free flowing chlamys and his pilos. The one on the right wears a loin-cloth, a dotted belt and a Phrygian cap. They seem to hit each other's shields rather than their opponent. Professor Trendall (LCS) suggests that this scene represents combat between a Greek and a Trojan. Washington Combat Painter.

XIII.l. Photograph courtesy of the Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, Budapest. The comic element in all of these scenes seems to be created by the awkward positions into which the warriors manoeuvre their shields, because these create a stalemate in which neither warrior can strike his opponent. Interpretation These duel scenes remind one of the parodies of fights which are said to have been a popular entertainment in the 4th century BC, especially in Capua. The evidence for this kind of performance in South Italy comes from both vase-painting and the literary tradition (for phlyax plays v. Gigante 1971; for phlyax vases v. Trendall (1959), (2nd ed. 1967); on the Fabula Atellana: Heurgon 1942 433-39; Salmon 1967: 60-1; for Roman sources on Campanian games v. Heurgon 1976: 22-9, e.g. Horace, Satires I, 5, 5 Iff; v. Heurgon 1976: 23 note 42 on the identification of Montesarchio with Caudium, the place where the contest of buffoonery which Horace described took place). We have evidence that these mock-fights were still practised in the 2nd century BC although in a slightly modified form. We know this because a Roman who attended such a performance recorded his experiences which have survived to us. Lucilius was a wealthy Roman who was an Eques Romānus and a poet. In the years 119-117 BC he travelled from Rome to Sicily to inspect his large estates (Heurgon 1976: 14-22). On the way he stopped at Capua, where he watched one of the then famous gladiator farces which mimicked real gladiatorial contests. Both performers in this contest probably wore masks. One, from Nola, is described as being a rowdy and bombastic figure who had a big tooth hanging out of his mouth. His name, Broccus or Broncus, survives to us. The other warrior, a Samnite, was the victor. However, the loser did not meet a bloody end instead he merely lost both the feathers from his helmet which the victor added to the five already on his (Heurgon 1976: 19). The vase-paintings provide another aspect to this problem. One of the vases shows a duel taking place at a stele (plate 125) which perhaps suggests such contests sometimes formed part of funerary ritual. This is further supported from a vase which is now lost but the decoration of which was recorded by Tischbein (Weege 1909: 133, fig. 13 after Tischbein, I 60) (here plate 51; cf. also Ch. 1, 5 and Ch. 5, 2). Again the scene takes place at a stele. One of the warriors is showing giving up while a youth or young warrior stops the contest by holding his sword upwards. Although we cannot be sure, this too may represent some kind of funerary performance. This hardly seems an appropriate setting for something entirely comic. Moreover, we should remember that some bloody duels were shown on Capuan and Paestan tomb-paintings. Although these are now lost, they are preserved in drawings and photographs. One Capuan tomb-painting shows identical</page><page sequence="114">88 Chapter 3 warriors standing is a symmetrical posture. However, a spear has wounded one in the thigh (plate 101) (Weege 1909: 107-8, no. 14, pl. 11.1; Breglia 1942: 38, pl. XVI, fig. 8). The drawing of a Paestan tomb-painting done by Pietro Pequignot in 1812 tells us that these contests had some special code of rules. This scene shows a paidagogos standing near the contest, stopping the fight with a gesture of his hand. At the same time one of the combatant's left leg is pierced by a javelin (here plate 52; cf. also Ch. 1, 5) (Weege 1909: 119, fig. 8) Finally, there is a tomb-painting which was discovered relatively recently which is now in the museum at Paestum (plate 127) (Napoli 1970d: 185, pl. XXVII. 2). It is not clear if the figures standing to the right and left of the duelling pair are all part of the same scene. This scene is somewhat atypical. Both warriors are dressed in a similar way, but they are not opposed symmetrically. The warrior on the left hand side, a bearded man, does not fight. He stands with his left foot seemingly raised slightly. In his left hand he carries two spears pointing upwards and in his right hand he carries a single spear, point downwards. Instead of having a shield, he has his chlamys flung over his left shoulder and arm. His opponent is about to spear him. It is unclear if the two spears shown lying on the ground have already wounded the left leg of the man who is not fighting. An amphora signed by Python has been found in association with a tomb-painting. This provides a date of 340/330 BC which could apply to the tomb-painting as well. Conclusions It is from tomb-paintings not from vases that we learn of the existence of bloody duels as part of the funerary cult. The figures on tomb-paintings are more colourfully equipped than those on vases. They wear patterned tunics with vertical red and black or blue stripes. They are edged in red. The helmets, greaves and decorated belts are golden (for a Capuan example, v. Weege 1909: 107, no. 14). The Capuan warriors are shown in a rather rough style, as strong men. Their features are common. The paintings perhaps belong to the last decades of the 4th century BC. The Paestan paintings are notable for their fine contour lines, especially when drawing legs. Some Lysippic influence seems to be observable in terms of the proportions of the body and head; the head appears relatively small in relation to the body. The facial features, as far as one can tell given the state of preservation, are drawn in the style seen on other tomb-paintings, both Capuan and Paestan. Normally the faces are depicted with a large straight nose. It is beyond the scope of this work to enter further into discussions on either the literary sources or the tomb-paintings as a source of evidence for the origins of gladiatorial contests in Etruria and Campania, or on the vase-paintings as a source for comic gladiatorial contests (for funeral games, gladiatorial contests and farces: Weege 1909: 134-5; Heurgon 1942: 429-31; Salmon 1967: 60-1; in the course of discussing an Etruscan terracotta altar, showing a symmetrical duel in relief, van der Meer (1982: 87-99, figs 1-3) considers the origin and dating of gladiatorial contests). One may assume that the scenes depicted on these vases reflect the mock fights which were in vogue as a form of public entertainment: a spectacle, which according to Lucilius, continued to be enjoyed into the 2nd century BC. One should see the public performances (and indeed the vases) as parodies of the serious business of real warfare. They belong to a popular South Italian cultural tradition which enjoyed comic plays based on daily life; this can be attested by the popularity of the phlyax vases and from the literary sources.</page><page sequence="115">The Samnite Warrior's Activities 89 The Samnite Warrior's Ritual Activities The other aspect of the warrior's life which is depicted in the iconographie record is ritual. In the main these ritual activities were either shared with women or common to both men and women. As such they are discussed in Chapter 6, Ritual Activities common to both Warriors and Women. 5 The Cult of the Single Warrior It is clear that individual warriors practised their own solitary religious ceremonies. This is made evident by scenes showing lone warriors standing before an altar clearly engaged in such activities. There are also some pictures which show the warrior standing in cult posture holding some sacred object but which lack an altar. Here an altar may be imagined and these activities may be assumed to be religious. Adolescent and mature warriors can be portrayed in both types of scene. It seems that the fully armed warrior took part in these activities either before embarking on or after a successful return from combat. If undertaken before combat one can perhaps reasonably argue that they formed a necessary part of the warrior's ritual and psychological preparation for the rigours of battle. Some examples 1) Skyphos, Boston 03.822. Plate 1. A not fully grown warrior is shown in profile to left. He has a chaplet in his hair and wears a loin-cloth, belt and soft white soled shoes.

They are not shown in an active rôle but they are armed with spear and shield. The image can be supposed to be a kind of portrait of members of the infantry which was made up of young and adult hoplites. They are shown with some form of headgear, such as a wreath, chaplet or a feathered helmet. Although as depictions of single warriors they bear a generic similarity to the scenes described above there is no reason to assume that any ritual activity is being portrayed here.

This may simply reflect a lower level of interest in women's lives on the part of the vase-painters and their customers, but it may also be, at least in part, due to the difficulty in distinguishing the Samnite woman from the colonial Greek woman when the former is not shown in her tribal costume. This difficulty is particularly pronounced when it comes to scenes depicting everyday life because in them Samnite women are not normally shown wearing their elaborate tribal costume. However, in scenes depicting certain ritual or ceremonial occasions, this costume makes Samnite women instantly recognisable. Thus we have a fuller and more varied view of the Samnite woman in her ritual life than in her more mundane domestic activities. Typically on ritual occasions the Samnite woman is depicted with her husband, the Samnite warrior. Rarely a colonial Greek appears as her counterpart at ceremonial events. For everyday life Samnite women seem to have preferred the Greek chiton to their tribal costume. However, they sometimes indicated their tribal identity by adding some detail from the native costume to the otherwise Greek-style dress. For example, often instead of wearing the colonial Greek-style girdle around the waist the Samnite woman prefers a decorated belt. On other occasions, Samnite women wear a simple cap on their heads, or a small head-dress similar to a pilos. Particularly remarkable is the drapery worn round the hips which imitates, and was probably inspired by the colonial fashion for wearing a himation, but is fastened according to the Samnite woman's taste, (cf. the neck amphora, BM F 197 (here plate 22; fig. 68) and the hydria, New York Metropolitan Museum 01.8.12 (here plate 16; fig. 69). For full references, v. below). 2 The Samnite Woman's Costume The native woman's costume is relatively uniform with certain variations in detail (Weege 1909; Lang 1915; 1940; Heurgon 1942: 424). The main element of the costume is a long garment which reaches to the ground. This is usually shown in profile and both sides of it are identical. The woman is either barefooted or wears white shoes. The full costume also includes a coloured cape which, in the red-figure technique, is portrayed in added white or purple. The cape covers the whole of the upper body and also the arms down to the elbows.</page><page sequence="120">96 Chapter 4 In three-quarter view, when slightly open or hanging over the back, part of the front of the cape is visible. Typically the women wear a piece of drapery, inspired by the Greek himation, round the hips and covering part of the skirt. This feature is depicted by parallel, rounded folds running down the hips. It is one of the typical aspects of the side view of the native woman's costume. A number of the vases described in greater detail in Ch. 6, 2, Ch. 6, 3 and Ch. 6, 4 show good examples of the female costume. The following three vases suffice to illustrate typical side views of Samnite women and provide the basis for the further discussion of the native costume: 1) Hydria, Naples, 874/82721. Plate 134. In this libation scene the woman holds an oinochoe while the warrior who stands before her holds out a skyphos. She wears the full native costume, including an elaborate head-dress, a cape in added white, and the long garment with the typical rounded folds of drapery running down from the hips.

Photograph courtesy of the Musées Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire. The material out of which the costume was made, seems to have been of a heavier quality than that made by the Greeks at this time. The light, often diaphanous, chiton or peplos, which we see worn by many women on red-figure vases of the 4th century BC, might have been made of wool or linen, spun into fine threads. It is unlikely that cotton or silk would have reached South Italy before the Ptolemies (for diaphanous garments v. Oakeshott 1979: 6, note 13; on cotton and silk v. Lutz 1923: 31-6). In general there is a notable trend among the indigenous women to make their clothes fit closely to the shape of the body. To achieve this, there must have been more cutting and sewing than was normal for Greek costume. The Greek dress, chiton or peplos, could have been made of one piece of material, either sewn at one side or not at all. Greek costume was draped loosely around the body and the folds could be arranged ad libitum , however freedom of movement would have been more difficult for a Greek than for a native woman. The skirt and the drapery The skirt appears almost identically in all the artistic representations. It therefore seems unnecessary to describe it more than once. It is the variations in the upper part of the dress which merit detailed discussion. In general, the skirt is a simple garment the most notable feature of which is the drapery mentioned earlier. Sometimes the skirt is patterned but often it is simply left plain. Occasionally the skirt lacks the drapery around the hips. An example of this is given below: Bell krater, Louvre K 261. Plate 68. On this libation scene the woman wears the full native costume with cape and head-dress. Her skirt lacks the drapery around the hips, but is decorated with a vertical black stripe with white dots.

As well as some purely indigenous characteristics, the skirt shows a great deal of Greek influence. This can be observed especially in connection with the previously mentioned drapery, which covers part of the skirt with rounded folds. This feature was probably inspired by the himation frequently draped around the hips of Greek figures. However, in the case of the Greeks we do not find those almost stereotypically rounded folds (figs 68 &amp; 69). Instead, the folds flow freely from the loosely attached himation depending on the way its edge is either held in one hand, or draped over an arm, or tucked in between the 1 The author's view that Hera wears a native style costume here is not shared by all authorities, notably Professor Trendall (pers. comm.). E.H.</page><page sequence="122">98 Chapter 4 arm and body. By contrast, the native woman's drapery, including its edges, is treated in a more standardised way. It is fastened under their broad belt. The edges either meet at the front or do not quite meet leaving some space between them. In the first case there are no short vertical folds at the front. Instead, long folds of drapery run across and down the front of the skirt in a gentle curve (plate 22; fig. 68) or flare out in ample curves (plate 134). There is one example, where the meeting of the edges at the front is indicated by a short curve, coming out from under the cape and turning away: Hydria, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 01.8.12.

This short curve gives the suggestion of drapery running around the other side of the hips. In the other case, where the edges do not meet in front, a group of narrow vertical folds run down the front (v. plate 23 and plate 135). The belt The broad belt is worn by virtually all natives, as they are represented on South Italian vases. It is depicted in added white, in black and also left reserved in the red-figure technique. In the latter technique we see in libation scenes a woman wearing a belt adorned with a pattern of white vertical stripes. Two examples of this will suffice: Skyphos, Bochum Antiken Museum, Ruhr-Universität, S 996. Plate 46. A woman offers a skyphos to a mounted warrior on his return from battle.

Ch. 6, 4, no. Ilia. The cape The cape covers the entire upper part of the body. Often it can be depicted in added white or purple, although examples in the standard red-figure technique also occur. Plate 134</page><page sequence="123">The Samnite Woman's Appearance 99 (hydria, Naples 874/8272 1, by the Astarita Painter) shows a well preserved example of cape in added white. The cape looks fluffy and of light weight like a wrap worn on cool days in summer. In this example the cape was kept together with a brooch, fastened lightly beneath the chin. The light weight of the cape is underlined by the upstanding edge of the neckline, which does not touch the woman's shoulders, leaving her necklace and part of her shoulders visible. Such capes would have been made by native women, whose primary occupations of spinning and weaving are attested by archaeological finds (cf. Ch. 5, 2). The wool they used was probably of Campanian origin. It must have been of a particularly fine quality and its whiteness, accentuated on the vase, is unlikely to have been inferior to that achievable with Apulian wool which was still highly regarded and praised in the 1st century BC (Heurgon 1976: 14). We may surmise that the cape, depicted in added purple (cf. for example plate 16: hydria, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 01.8.12), is meant to represent real examples dyed that colour. Research indicates that the purple used for dyeing, as well as for painting, was derived from an extract of the murex shell. The jacket-like cape Occasionally native women are shown wearing a jacket-like garment instead of the standard cape. Unlike the other capes which seem to be simple wraps, these seem to have actual sleeves, although it is not always possible to discern exactly how these garments were worn. In plate 22 (neck amphora by the Libation Painter, BM F 197) the jacket-like cape has an unusual shape which is difficult to interpret. It fits the upper part of the body tightly. All of the right shoulder and also somewhat more than that, is covered by folds of material coming down from the head-dress. The right sleeve, which remains visible, goes down to the elbow (fig. 70). The garment is fastened at the front. This is indicated by two vertical lines and two dots, one black, one white. It has a low-cut neck-line, depicted by two rounded lines. The frontal part hangs down below the waist with a remarkably fashioned edge, indicated by two parallel rounded lines. The front part seems to be kept close to the waist by the broad belt. One can suggest that some of the horizontal lines are supposed to depict the belt coming out from beneath the garment through holes cut into the frontal part. Fig. 70 Jacket-like cape, after neck amphora, BM F 197</page><page sequence="124">100 Chapter 4 This solution cannot be applied in another case, where the woman wears a broadly similar type of cape, but with the frontal part, though similarly shaped, shorter and hanging loose over the upper edge of her broad belt (plate 9: hydria, Louvre K 2772. v. LCS (3/301) 406 pl. 160.1 ; Indigeni, p. 18, pl. 51; cf. here Ch. 1, 2 and Ch. 6, 3, no. Ic). In any case one can say that the example with the long frontal part (plate 22) seems to have been shorter on the side where a horizontal line under the elbow might mark its lower edge, than on the other side. The real problem in discussing this type of garment is that the depictions do not always permit a fully reliable interpretation of how it was worn. The chiton In everyday life the Samnite woman seems to have preferred the Greek-style chiton to her native costume. The native costume seems to have been favoured for ritual occasions. Sometimes, however, the chiton was worn at such events but with certain native adjuncts. Plate 23 (pseudo-panathenaic amphora by the Caivano Painter, Hamburg, Termer coll.) shows a libation in honour of a warrior returning from battle. The woman depicted here is of heavier proportions than those usually represented, suggesting that she is a matron or mother. She wears a Greek-style chiton but follows native taste in that it fits tightly to her body. Greek women preferred ample, loosely arranged folds for their clothing. Her broad white belt and her skirt, which is fashioned in the usual way (as described above) accentuate the non-Greek impression. On the other hand, it is typical of the Greek manner that she leaves exposed the upper part of the left breast, her left shoulder, and her left arm, so that the upper edge of the dress runs from under the arm on the left side up and over the right shoulder. Additionally, she wears a long cape or mantle, fastened together by a brooch which is slightly left of centre on her neck. Her cape, which covers her right shoulder and hangs down her back, is very different from the standard wrap type and equally bears little relation to the jacket-like garment. She also wears a remarkable head-dress which is discussed below. The head-dress One of the most noteworthy features of the Samnite woman's costume is the head-dress. The standard head-dress is of a purely indigenous shape. It consists of a piece of cloth, which is folded in rather complicated way. It is not clear if this style belonged to some old tradition or to contemporary fashion among the native women. A typical example of this type of head-dress may be seen on the hydria (Naples 874/82721) by the Astarita Painter (plate 134; fig. 71). The exact shape of the head-dress is not standardised, however. A variant example of the same theme may be seen on the neck amphora (BM F 197) by the Libation Painter (plate 22; fig. 72). Here the woman wears a long veil, which is formed into folds running across the head and into a high point on the top of the head. The latter might be caused by a particularly high coiffure underneath the veil. Some of the material of the veil rests on the right shoulder in a number of folds, while the rest hangs down the back. This would have supported the weight of the whole creation, thus allowing it to stay in place even when the woman moved her head, as she would have done in the process of offering the skyphos to the departing warrior. A different but equally remarkable type of head-dress is worn by the woman on the pseudo-panathenaic amphora (Hamburg, Termer coll.) by the Caivano Painter (plate 23; fig. 73). The back of her hair is worn in a net while on her head she wears a relatively high cylindrical head-dress, which resembles a polos or an Etruscan tutulus . White and red horizontal stripes run round it and a row of small vertical white stripes marks the upper edge. This form of head-dress emphasises the matronly appearance of the figure. It seems unlikely that this type of head-dress was either an individual invention or a fashion peculiar 2 v. note 3 in Ch. 1, 2, p. 7.

Rather it seems likely that it belongs either to some old tribal tradition or to a more widespread contemporary fashion among native women. The following are three Paestan vases showing broadly similar head-dresses: a) Paestan bell krater, Richmond (Virginia) 81.72. Plate 61. A native woman is shown wearing a head-dress of roughly cylindrical shape. It seems to be made of soft material. It is of a longer size than the Campanian example and bends backwards into some folds.

Unlike the other two examples, this head-dress stands rigidly upright. Professor Trendall (RVP) refers to this head-dress as a 'polos-crown'. Signed by Python. RVP (2/240), p. 139, pl. 89a.

E.H.</page><page sequence="126">102 Chapter 4 Conclusion Like their male counterparts, Samnite women have a distinctive costume which distinguishes them from colonial Greek women. However, the women seem to have reserved their full costume for religious or ceremonial events, opting instead for an adapted version of Greek costume for everyday life. The scenes when the full costume is worn can provide some insight into the status of the native women. The costume they wear is highly elaborate. The scenes strongly suggest that they are the wives of the native warriors to whom they offer libations. The warrior themselves wear an elaborate costume and have arms and sometimes also horses in their possession. One may reasonably assume that the warriors, depicted on the vase and tomb- paintings, were men of relatively high status. All of this suggests that they enjoyed high status and probably no small degree of wealth. This view is further supported by the fact that the women are sometimes accompanied by a servant. The Samnite women may been seen as roughly equivalent to a female citizen of high class in a Greek community. The fact that they are shown having adopted some aspects of Greek appearance for everyday life only serves to reinforce this suggestion.</page><page sequence="127">Chapter 5 The Samnite Woman's Activities 1 Introduction A softer side to Samnite life can be observed on vases dated from about 340 BC onwards when the women's activities begin to be represented. The Astarita and Libation Painters and their associates are the first to show the Samnite woman in her full costume at certain ritual occasions. The picture which emerges of the Samnite women's life is rather restricted. This is partly due to the fact that Greek costume seems to have been preferred for daily life and thus it may not always be possible to distinguish native women from their colonial Greek counterparts. However, it probably also reflects the type of scenes favoured by the manufacturers of South Italian red-figure pottery and their clients. We have a fuller picture of the Samnite woman's religious and ceremonial life, but even here it is likely that the picture is only partial. Just as with the men, the women must have taken part in many more activities than are depicted in the iconographie record. Indeed, the situation may well be worse in the case of women as the activities of warriors seem to have been a more favoured topic for vase-painting. The female activities we know something about may be divided into two categories. The first is domestic activities, the second ritual. Depictions of Samnite women in domestic situations are relatively rare. We have a greater number of scenes showing ritual activities involving Samnite women. For example, they carry out certain tasks at ceremonial, or cult, events. Obviously, they have a central rôle in the rituals associated with matrimony. They also offer libations in honour of warriors leaving for or returning from combat. Then there is the funerary cult, where they stand at a naiskos or stele making suitable votive offerings. In certain cases they perform the funerary cult together with a colonial Greek man. All of these are activities either shared with men or also common to men. These are therefore discussed in greater detail in Chapter 6 - Ritual Activities Common to both Warriors and Women. However, there are a number of scenes which show women only involved in certain ritual activities, these are treated separately below in Ch. 5, 3 and Ch. 5, 4. 2 The Samnite Woman's Domestic Activities Samnite women presumably took part in a great range of activities connected with the home. Sadly, a great number of these activities are simply not reflected in the iconographie record. For example, it is probably a safe assumption that Samnite women prepared food</page><page sequence="128">104 Chapter 5 for their families but we have no depiction of them doing so. The fact that the natives portrayed on red-figure vases are likely to have been of high status may, of course, have its own impact on the type of scenes favoured by the artists. However, despite all the difficulties created by the partiality of the iconographie record we can assemble some image of Samnite woman's everyday life. Child-rearing must have been a major activity for Samnite women. Although, this subject was not in itself chosen as the topic for vase-paintings we do have a few images of the Samnite woman as a mother. For example: Hydria, Budapest T 763. Plate 3. The scene shows a woman in full native costume offering a skyphos and a wreath to the returning horseman. Between the woman and her husband stands a youth dressed in a tunic and broad belt, with a wreath in his hair who may be assumed to be their son. The scene gives us a rare insight into Samnite family life as the boy joins his mother to welcome his father home. LNO Painter. LCS (4/289), p. 480, pl. 186.3; Indigeni, p. 19, pl. 62.

Photograph courtesy of the Museo Jatta, Ruvo. For this vase cf. Ch. 2, 1. Literary sources suggest that much of Samnite life was devoted to agriculture and that women had an important rôle in this sphere. Horace in Odes 3.6.39-41 gives a tantalising glimpse of this rôle as he laments the decline of traditional values. He tells how women had in the past maintained a strict discipline in running the houshold and sending their grown- up sons to work in the fields. As Horace was a native of Venusia one can perhaps argue that his view of the strict mother taking charge of her adult sons was based on the practices of real Samnite women. On the other hand, archaeological evidence suggests that the Samnites had a great deal of affection for their children, judging by the care lavished on child graves (Salmon 1967: 59). There is little evidence for nature of the Samnite woman's relationship with her husband. One can suggest that the libation scenes show the woman as a dutiful wife while the literary description of Samnite marriage customs gives some idea of how social relations were conducted (cf. Ch. 6, 2). The women must have had an important rôle to play in economic life of the household, and the wider community, although these activities are seldom portrayed. There is an old tradition that native women were known as good wool-workers performing spinning, dyeing and weaving. This can be supported from the archaeological evidence as loom- weights and spindle-whorls are among the most common finds on native sites in South</page><page sequence="129">The Samnite Woman's Activities 105 Italy. Clearly, weaving was important in the native economy. That weaving was a female activity is indicated by the fact that the graves of Samnite women contained spindles (Salmon 1967: 55-56). The native costumes depicted on the red-figure vases also betray evidence of the women's skill in wool-working. The pure white and purple capes provide a good example of this (cf. Ch. 4, 2). There is at present only one Campanian vase-painting available which shows the Samnite woman performing a task connected with wool-working. This is on the reverse of the neck amphora (Berlin F 2990) ascribed to the Owl Pillar Group (LCS (Appendix 1/36) p. 669, (no ill.); Lang 1915: 245, fig. 124; Beazley 1943: 68). Here a woman is shown seated in her room with a spindle in her right hand and a kalathos under her chair as her wool-basket. Eros stands before her and while she is not depicted as in any way glamorous, she wears a Greek chiton with a her tribal head-dress indicating her origins. The sheer domesticity of this activity together with the unglamorous portrayal of the woman might perhaps suggest that this woman does not belong to an élite group. There are relatively few indications of other activities performed by women. However, there are a few pictures, where we see the woman as a kind of paidagogos where she teaches girls mime-dancing and similar activities. This rôle is remarkable in that it shows women's leisure activities. These scenes provide some insight into relations between women and give us a view of the women's life away from the world of men, where the warriors were dominant. Neck amphora, Berlin F 2990. Plate 138. A woman is shown seated. The woman wears a chiton and a himation but her head-dress suggests she has native origins. A young girl dances before her.

Conclusions For all these domestic and leisure activities Greek dress with native adjuncts is preferred. Generally for rituals native costume is the order of the day. However, Greek dress is worn, although in this instance with the hair uncovered, at certain prénuptial ceremonies. At these rituals groups of women, of varying number, are pictured together while a warrior offers gifts. The warrior clearly plays an active part in these prénuptial ceremonies and in a few cases he meets a colonial Greek woman (v. Ch. 6, 2). It is particularly remarkable that there seldom seems to exist a portrait of the single figure of the Samnite woman, while there are numerous portraits of the colonial Greek woman. It is difficult to offer an explanation of this unless one argues that native women were of lower social standing than their colonial Greek counterparts. Contrary to this suggestion is one of the libation scenes which shows a Samnite woman in her elegant native</page><page sequence="130">106 Chapter 5 costume and a Greek colonial girl standing behind her, as a servant carrying the votive objects ready to hand them over to her mistress at the appropriate moment in the ritual (plate 16: v. Ch. 6, 3, no. Ha). This demonstrates that within the native community a Samnite woman could be of sufficiently high social rank to have a colonial Greek girl as a servant. This leads one to consider the likely possibility that Greek captives were used as slaves by the native population. Such a view can be supported by some of the scenes showing prisoners in Greek dress described in Ch. 3, 3. In conclusion, although there are only a few examples to prove certain differences in social standing, these seem to have existed not only between colonial Greek women and Samnite women but also among the Samnites themselves just as they must have done among the Greeks. 3 The Samnite Woman's Ritual Activities One of the most interesting aspects of the Samnite woman's life is the extent of her ritual activity. Clearly women played an important rôle in the symbolism of much of Samnite ritual. However, the majority of the Samnite woman's ritual activities either involve men (such as marriage rituals, libation scenes and some of the scenes depicting the funerary cult) or are common to men (such as the funerary cult). Often, we may assume that it is man who are the focus of the ritual. This is true of the libation scenes, the scenes where a warrior receives a piece of equipment for the first time and can also apply to the funerary rituals. There is evidence, however, for two special cults which were exclusively female or at least where women are dominant. Before discussing these rituals in detail it is worth listing some of the objects commonly depicted on red-figure vases which had ritual significance. Sometimes it is only by the presence of these objects is it possible to interpret the scenes as ritual. Many of these objects have specific reference to Aphrodite and Dionysos, both of whom were very popular deities on South Italian vase-painting. There is a strong suggestion of fertility symbolism in many of the objects. Seemingly fertility was an important concern in Samnite ritual, as fertility symbols occur in representations of the cults associated with marriage and with death.

Judging from the evidence of vase-painting Orphism seems to have been very popular in South Italy (v. Schmidt 1975: 105-37). One should also note the fertility symbolism of many of these objects. There are of course many other indicators of ritual which are sometimes depicted. These can include architectural features such as a stele, a naiskos, or a column in funerary scenes, or an altar in scenes showing rituals for the living (cf. for example Ch. 3, 5). Other objects which frequently appear in ritual scenes include: plakous cakes, phialai, pyramides, oinochoai, situlae, skyphoi, tambourines, and thymiateria. Ritual scenes other take place out of doors and indications of this are also often depicted. 4 Two Special Female Cults I Samnite women surround a single Samnite woman The first of these exclusively female cults show a group of women surrounding a central woman. The women who surround the central figure offer ritual objects out to her. The women do not wear the full native costume but are half-draped or wear Greek dress. While it is clear that the scenes represent rituals of some sort, they are difficult to interpret as no deity is depicted nor is there any indication that these are funerary scenes. Perhaps one can suggest that these are pre-marital ceremonies for women from which men were excluded. Although one should note that men were involved in other probable pre-marital rituals (cf. Ch. 6, 2). If this is the case the woman receiving all the attention would be the prospective bride. Ia) Hydria, Vatican U 48. Plate 140. In the centre of the group is a semi-draped woman who is shown before an altar adorned with votive objects. She holds a phiale full of eggs and a wreath. Three women surround her; two are seated, one stands. They hold different symbolic objects out to the woman in the centre. There are a number of indications that the scene takes place outside.

Photograph courtesy of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, Leiden. II The Women's Eros Cult The cult of Eros was a Greek tradition which stretches back into prehistory and survived into the Roman period. Eros was among the oldest of the Greek divinities. He was</page><page sequence="132">108 Chapter 5 worshipped by both men and women at Thespiai where he had an idol of unworked stone. It is said that Plutarch (lst-2nd century AD) travelled to Thespiai with his young wife to have her given the blessing of fertility according to the rites of Eros. Whether a relationship exists between this tradition and the cult scenes depicted on the 4th century BC red-figure vase-painting of South Italy is difficult to say. However, from the evidence provided by the vase-paintings we can be confident of the existence of an important Eros cult in South Italy. Scenes depicting the cult are particularly favoured by Apulian artists. Two types of Eros figure are normally portrayed. The first is the standard Greek type Eros, the second is a more effeminate "Samnite" Eros, who wears the type of jewellery usually worn by wealthy women. It seems clear that Eros was the subject of cult worship by both Greek and native women. For example, we may observe that ritual objects were carried by colonial Greeks who are depicted without an Eros figure as well as by those shown with a Greek type Eros (v. examples Ha and lib below). Moreover, we sometimes see a Samnite Eros depicted with a colonial Greek woman (v. example lie below). The pictorial development of the effeminate Eros There are two kinds of effeminate Eros figures; seated and standing. The standing variety is the one seen in the earliest representations showing show a tendency towards effeminate features. The seated variety is the one most heavily adorned with jewellery like that of a rich woman. However, the cult practices are not forgotten because even the most effeminate versions are always shown with some of the ritual objects mentioned above. The standing Eros can have one of two types of base. They stand on a Ionic column or on a regular base formed of small stones heaped closely together. The seated variety is always shown on a tall heap of stones placed one on top of the other; the stones which make up this type of base appear to be unworked. Samnite women seem to concentrate on worshipping the effeminate type of Eros. Normally the woman is shown with one foot on a small pile of stones while she offers two of the ritual-type objects mentioned above. The Eros figure is also normally shown holding two ritual objects. However, women are sometimes shown seated on a rock receiving a blessing bestowed on her by the worship of Eros. The representations appear to show Eros himself officiating at these rituals. These may not, in fact, be mythological scenes. Rather, they may show a priest dressed as Eros presiding. Dressing the priest as the god seems to have been a feature of South Italian religion (see, e.g. Artemis and her followers: Ghali- Kahil 1965: 20; Schneider-Herrmann 1970; Schneider-Herrmann 1979). Finally, it seems that representations of the seated Eros are found in greater quantity than those of the standing variety although this could be entirely due to the vagaries of the archaeological record.

Photograph with thanks to the trustees of the British Museum There are many other Eros scenes to be found on South Italian red-figured vases (see, for example, RVSIS, figs 243-247). These testify to the popularity of the cult. It is perhaps worth mentioning that there are also scenes showing an exclusively colonial Greek Eros cult. On a type 1 oinochoe (Canberra A.N.U. 65.26), ascribed to the Menzies Painter, we see a colonial Greek woman worshipping a Greek Eros, who is standing before her. Both have ritual objects in their hands (RVAp II (26/89), p. 826, pl. 31 1.2). However, the nature of the colonial Greek Eros cult lies beyond the scope of our study. Addendum - Early interpretations of the Eros cult in South Italy It is worth noting that Furtwängler (1874: 44, note) drew attention to an Apulian 4th century hydria (Ruvo 584: v. RVAp I (6/175), p. 155, (no ill.))? which M. Jatta described and interpreted in the catalogue of vases owned by him and his brother, G. Jatta, written in 1869 (Jatta 1869: 300ff., 58a)1. The vase is ascribed to the Dijon Painter and shows a typical composition. Eros is seated holding an egg and a woman stands before him making an offering. Furtwängler assumed the existence of an Eros cult for women. Jatta considered the existence of an Eros cult which he assumed was more developed than the well known cult from Thespiai. He interpreted the seated Eros as an 'agalma' representing Orphic ideas. Quoting some of the verses of the Orphic Eros Hymn he implied that the eternal power of creativity in nature is inherent to the South Italian Eros cult as shown on the hydria, Ruvo 584. (For the popularity of Orphism in South Italy v. Schmidt 1975: 105-37) It is interesting that Furtwängler goes somewhat further than Jatta, by concluding that the South Italian Eros cult was a female cult. Obviously, to be fair to Jatta, no one could have known then, more than a hundred years ago, what we know today since excavations have added so much new material to enhance our knowledge. 1 My special thanks are due to Professor A.D. Trendall who was kind enough to send me a photocopy of the text of the otherwise almost unavailable catalogue of the vase collection in Ruvo which contains M. Jatta's interpretation of the scene with Eros on the hydria, Ruvo 584.</page><page sequence="135">Ritual Activities common to both Warriors and Women</page><page sequence="136">Chapter 6 Ritual Activities common to both Warriors and Women 1 Introduction In earlier sections we have examined the separate ritual activities of warriors and women. Both sexes took part in exclusively single sex ceremonies (cf. Ch. 3, 5 and Ch. 5, 4). More common, however, are ritual activities which are shared by both warriors and women. Such scenes include ritual meetings of warriors and women which may interpreted as part of a succession of rites connected with courtship and marriage. The much discussed libation scenes are another important set of rites in which both men and women have a significant rôle to play. There are also funerary ceremonies common to both sexes, but which may be practised by groups of individuals of the same sex. It seems that the dead were honoured in a generically similar way irrespective of sex. These shared rituals are particularly interesting in that they portray interaction between the sexes, thus, broadening our picture of Samnite life. They provide an insight into crucial social relationships not covered by scenes which are devoted to the activities of one sex only. 2 Ritual Meetings of Warriors and Women Prénuptial rituals according to the ancient literary sources According to the ancient authors there were three races who practised unusual methods for arranging marriages. These were the Babylonians, the Illyrians and the Samnites. The Babylonian and Illyrian rituals are described as closely related and seem to involve a kind of auction (Herodotus 1.196), whereas Samnite rituals involved some form of competition (Strabo 5.4.12). According to Strabo, each year the Samnites selected their ten best young men and their ten best young women, of whom the best male had to marry the best female, the second best the second best, and so forth. Those involved were not allowed to make their own choices. If, in the course of time, a young man turned out bad, then he would be publicly shamed and his wife was taken away from him (Salmon 1967: 57-8). The literary tradition fails to tell us how the selection was made or when these customs were practised. Some scholars have suggested that selection was on the basis of some athletic performance, e.g. running (Frazer 1911: 301-5). These customs may be assumed to have fallen out of use when the Samnites lost their independence (Salmon 1967: 57). However, the rituals could well have had a very long</page><page sequence="137">1 14 Chapter 6 history. Over the course of time considerable changes could have taken place making what we see on the 4th century vases bear little relation to the origins of the tradition. The Strabo passage reminds one that according to Pliny {Nat. Hist. III. 102) the Paediculi of South Italy were supposed to be descended from nine Illyrian young men and nine Illyrian young women. It is worth mentioning some recent scholarly suggestions on inter-tribal communications and on tribal migrations of the Illyrians, Iapygians, Messapians, and the Macedonians in the first half of the Iron Age. Illyrian linguistic elements are said to be present in Messapian, although one should be careful in placing too much emphasis on ancient Illyrian as so little of it survives (Krahe &amp; De Simone 1955; Salmon 1967: 39-40). Illyrian pottery characteristics can be seen on Daunian ceramics (De Juliis 1977) while pottery of the Korçe-Devoll type has been found at Otranto in the Salento peninsula (Yntema 1985: 77). This latter type of pottery had a distinct influence on the local pottery of that part of South Italy. Contacts between the Illyrians and the Samnites as late as the 5th century BC are considered possible by some, during the period when Alexander the Molossian was active in South Italy (Holloway 1970: 11). Representations of warriors visiting women It might be relevant to discuss a group of vases which have related pictures on them. These scenes show warriors and women together; sometimes they are shown performing some ritual activity together. On one vase we see a warrior visiting a woman inside her home. The scene, which is badly damaged, shows the warrior standing in a humble pose before the woman (plate 149). Another scene shows a warrior and a woman walking together outside. The woman wears Greek drapery but her broad belt reveals her origins. Rarely a warrior is shown visiting a colonial Greek woman, but on the other vases the figures shown are all, as far as we can tell, Samnite (v. plate 109). Generally the warrior does not bring a gift to the woman. The woman is usually shown outdoors, seated on a rock in a sacred place. She seems to welcome the warrior who, for his part, stands before her humbly. The scenes strongly suggest that a conversation goes on between the two. The same is also true of the libation scenes discussed later (cf. Ch. 6, 3 below). While these scenes may be interpreted as connected with marriage, there is nothing in them to give direct support to the account of Samnite prénuptial rituals given by the ancient authors. Some examples of meeting and visiting Examples without fertility symbolism (cf the list of ritual objects in Ch. 5, 3) 1) Neck amphora, Vatican U 45. Plate 149.

Plate 154. The composition is on two levels on this vase. The lower part has the main scene of a warrior and a woman meeting in the centre of the scene. The scene may be interpreted as a wedding. The warrior is in full panoply while the woman wears the full native costume. Both are being honoured by people behind them. Behind the woman is a second woman who offers a phiale; behind the warrior is an altar and behind that a second warrior. The second warrior offers a wreath above the altar. The upper part of the vase has a wool basket hanging as a household (domestic) symbol above the central woman, the bride. Two other half-draped women are seated on the upper level on either side of the bride and groom. There are three points which distinguish this as a wedding scene. Firstly, the bride is in tribal costume (cf. Ch. 4, 2). Secondly, there is the wool basket above the bride's head and thirdly, the fact that all the other figures honour the two central ones.

Conclusions The attempt to discuss the Samnite wedding ritual on the basis of the aforementioned vase paintings can only be described as hypothetical. There is no literary or other tradition to augment these data. Nor can one be sure that these scenes, as arranged here, can be seen as representing a chronological progression from the beginning to the end of the ceremonies. However, they do share common features with the libation scenes described below. In both cases the figures hold oinochoai, situlae, or phialai in order to offer a drink to the warrior. The reason to take a ritual drink is not necessarily always the same. Indeed, one seems to be an offering on departure for or return from combat, while the other forms part of the marriage ceremony. A further similarity to the libation scenes may be assumed in the ritual incantations which are also likely to have been spoken during the marriage. What distinguishes these from libation scenes is the use of fertility symbolism and the way other figures, when they are present, honour the central figures with votives. It is these features in particular which allow us to interpret these ritual visits as forming part of the preparations for marriage. The example showing the warrior offering a ritual gift to the woman supports the view that this represents some form of courtship. Addendum - The relationship between Campanian and Paestan rituals Paestan bell krater, Richmond (Virginia) 81.72. Plate 61. The scene shows a woman holding a skyphos and phiale and a fully armed native warrior with a sprig in his right hand. The two meet on either side of a small table topped with votives. The scene is comparable with that discussed above (here no. 7, plate 153) where the warrior and the woman are shown on either side of a thymiaterion. These similarities attract our interest when considering the relationship between Campanian and Paestan representations of native rituals. Attributed to Python.

These scenes are instantly recognisable as rituals performed by women to honour men. In most cases we may assume the man to be the woman's husband. Occasionally a woman seems to be performing the same ritual for her adult son (e.g. plate 23). Apart from the associations with wine-drinking the scenes are free of all other ritual symbolism, with the result that they cannot be confused with cult or marriage rites. It was part of the Samnite woman's activities to present the Samnite warrior a libation drink, by offering a phiale or a skyphos full of wine, prior to his departure for combat or on his return from combat. These scenes again show how central an activity combat was in Samnite life in that ritual attention had to be devoted to it. While it is entirely normal for a wife to say good-bye to her departing husband or to welcome back her returning husband, these scenes are too formal to be interpreted as simple domestic greetings. They have too great a level of ceremony attached to them. Normally the warrior and the woman stand opposed to each other. The woman characteristically wears her tribal costume, while the warrior is armed. Some scenes show the warrior in the act of parting on foot. Then he is normally shown slightly turned away from his wife but looking back at her. She looks at him (e.g. plate 68) after the ceremonial ritual had been performed. Sometimes, when the ritual is shown taking place, there is another warrior is turning away from the main scene but looking back as though on the point of departure. Furthermore, it seems quite probable that the woman utters a ritual oath or prayer while the ceremony is performed. Sometimes the woman is shown making a speaking gesture with her right hand while holding an oinochoe in her left. The warrior is shown holding a phiale or a skyphos and apparently listening to his wife's ritual oath (e.g. plate 134). There is an Etruscan inscription from Capua dated to the early to mid-5th century BC which may contain a funerary oath but apparently not one which was spoken by the Samnites. Linguistic analysis suggests that this oath contains elements which are not in the Etruscan or Osean languages but may belong to another otherwise unknown linguistic group (Frederiksen 1979: 303). It seems that there may have been other tribes, not just the Samnites, who spoke ritual incantations on certain ceremonial occasions. It is also worth noting, as a side issue, that Samnite warriors are sometimes shown with open mouths in vase painting which may be intended to reflect speech.

The choice of this subject matter is hardly surprising given that the tombs were painted in honour of the dead and many of the vases were made for funerary use. Most of the tomb-paintings have been destroyed but those which do survive, albeit often in a very poor state, can be dated to the second half of the 4th century BC. It is noteworthy that the vase-paintings seem to depict a different tradition from that shown on the tomb-paintings. This could perhaps be explained by technical considerations in that vases are decorated using a different technique from tomb walls (which are frescos). At any rate, the same subject matter is treated differently by different artists. However, in both vase-painting and wall-painting Italiote influence can be noted. The vase-painters preferred to show one of the following: a naiskos (an architectural structure resembling a shrine), an Ionic column or a stele with figures on either side of them offering ritual objects. The ritual objects are mainly natural products, with many seeds, indicating the importance of fertility as an attribute of certain deities. It seems that in Samnite society both sexes could be honoured in similar ways after death. In some of the funerary scenes the deceased and those who honour them are all of one sex; we also have scenes which are mixed. For example a warrior and a woman pay their respects to a deceased woman shown inside a naiskos in plate 77. Another interesting social phenomenon is that in some scenes the funerary cult seems to involve participation from colonial Greeks (e.g. plates 136, 157, 158 &amp; 159). Clearly the relationship between the Greeks and the Samnites was not hostile in all cases. In the naiskos the deceased is shown in various states while the relatives and friends make religious offerings. A philosophical background in Orphism can be suggested. The offerings are bestowed on an Ionic column or a stele. Some representations show a woman touching a column or stele instead of making an offering while others show the deceased seated near the column or stele. The representations of the same subjects on Capuan and Nolan tomb-paintings do not have the funerary monuments seen on the vases. There are two particular tomb-paintings, 2 For Paestan examples cf. Le tombe dipinte di Paestum , by A. Pontrandolfo and A. Rouveret.

On these paintings the deceased is shown as though she were alive. Indeed, were it not for the presence in the scene of pomegranates, which were symbols of death, one would think she is alive. The use of a pomegranate as a symbol of death may be attributed to Greek influence, derived from the myth of Persephone. For symbolic objects of fertility v.

Addendum to vases with naiskoi on them Naiskoi are far more commonly represented on Apulian than Campanian vases. The naiskoi as depicted on vase-paintings are related to actual limestone architectural and sculptural remains from Taranto. Limestone naiskoi and other figurative sculptural remains survive in a huge number of fragments. They can sometimes be reconstructed, however (Carter 1975: 15, pl. 70, reconstruction of the Via Umbria naiskos).</page><page sequence="144">Ritual Activities 1 2 1 It is not known where these monuments were originally erected. One example is said to have been found on the Acropolis at Taranto. Often there is a difference in scale between the actual limestone monuments and the naiskoi depicted on vases; the actual monuments seem commonly to have been on a smaller scale than those shown on vase-painting. However, the iconographie record is sufficiently faithful to the surviving limestone fragments to demonstrate that the paintings do reflect actual bulidings. The bulk of both the sculpture and the vases is dated to the second half of the 4th century BC but it is not clear which was produced first. The sculpture, however, survives into the Hellenistic period of the 3rd century BC (Bernabò Brea 1952; Carter 1975; Lohman 1979). II Those showing an Ionic column Ha) Hydria, Dunedin E 48.275.

Many examples of Capuan tomb-painting were destroyed during World War Two, and only a few are now preserved in the Museo Campano at Capua. IVa) Plate 160. The surviving portion shows the upper part of a woman sitting on a throne. Her head is shown in profile but her body in shown in three-quarter view. The figure is only vaguely recognisable but we may reconstruct what she would have looked like because of the comparison with the somewhat better preserved Nolan example (v. below). She wears a black diadem in her hair and a long veil draped over her back, a black dress and a necklace. She holds up at eye level a pomegranate which she looks at in her badly preserved hand. A second pomegranate hangs down from the top of the picture. Some of the upper parts of the throne are visible. Weege 1909: 111, no. 22, pl. 11.2. IVb) Plate 161. This badly damaged painting shows a Samnite horseman returning home after combat with trophies hanging from his spear. A woman greets him. From the top of the picture a pomegranate hangs down. The use of this symbol indicates that this is a funerary scene. Weege 1909: 105, no. 8, pl. 9.2. For another Capuan tomb-painting showing a warrior's return with funerary iconography, again pomegranates v. Weege 1909: 105-6, no. 9, pl. 10. The following two paintings are similar to the above, in that they show a warrior's return from combat. Such scenes are clearly reminiscent of the libation scenes. However, given the undoubtedly funerary nature of the paintings mentioned in IVb, they too may be related to the Samnite funerary cult. rVc) Plate 10. This painting shows a horseman coming home with a tunic as a trophy hanging from his spear. He has a bearded prisoner wearing a cloak walking behind his horse gripping its tail in his hand. The figures are clearly recognisable although poorly preserved. Weege 1909: 104-5, no. 7, pl. 9.1. For this fresco cf. Ch. 1, 2. IVd) Plate 47. This scene may be made up from three separate fragments. A horseman is shown in left profile wearing a feathered and crested helmet. He holds two spears. He is seated on a horse but its legs are somewhat damaged. The warrior is relatively well preserved. Weege 1909: 103-4, no. 6, pl. 8. For this fresco cf. Ch. 1, 4. and Ch. 2, 5. Nolan tomb-painting IVe) Plate 162. The most important surviving Nolan funerary picture shows a complete figure of an elegant woman seated on an elaborately worked throne. The large and well preserved painting provides examples of the various ways in which an artist could present his material. The throne is shown in frontal view, the woman's face is shown in profile while her body is shown in three-quarter view. Weege 1909: 102, pl. 7. The Capuan tomb-painting mentioned above (no. IVa, plate 160) is so close to the better preserved Nolan example in terms of subject matter, that one may reconstruct the former on the basis of a comparison with the latter. A particularly interesting artistic</page><page sequence="146">Ritual Activities 1 2 3 feature of both paintings is the depiction of the nose which is thick with a slightly rounded tip. This perhaps represents an attempt to depict a 'racial' characteristic. One should mention a few minor details which differ. The Capuan woman has a black diadem, the Nolan woman has a white one. The Capuan woman has a long veil extending from her diadem over her back and her left shoulder, the Nolan woman has a white veil. In the Capuan painting there is a pomegranate hanging down from the top of the picture which is lacking in the Nolan example. However, both women holds pomegranates in their hands. In both scenes it is only the pomegranates which indicate their funerary character. If it were not for these symbols of death we could easily see the Nolan example, in particular, as representing a living woman. The style of this painting perhaps gives us a slight glimpse of the so-called 'Great Art' of the 4th century BC which is now lost to us and only known from references in the literary sources. The funerary tomb-paintings may be dated to 330/320 BC. Conclusion By the end of the 4th century BC the Samnites had ceased to require realistic representations of the funerary rituals which they performed at naiskoi, stelai, and Ionic columns. No longer were men and women, if still honouring their dead with symbolic gifts at these kinds of monuments, shown on vase-painting. Similarly, the tombs were not decorated with scenes of funerary ritual. The artistic tradition which followed immediately on from the above was that of Apulian tomb-painting with their long rows of garlands, their added ritual objects and their depictions of Egyptian Hadra hydriai. For Apulian tomb-paintings cf. Tinè Bertocchi 1964; for Hadra hydriai cf. De Vita 1960: 1082-4, figs 1381 &amp; 1382; Hornbostel 1980: 19- 20, no. 15. Addendum In the above discussion on tomb-paintings attention was drawn to the similarity between some of the scenes showing the funerary cult and libation scenes. Similarly, there are also a few vase-paintings which could easily be mistaken for libation scenes although they, in fact, show funerary scenes. On close inspection, however, their true nature becomes clear. It is the absence of a phiale or similar vessel for the warrior to receive a libation in and the presence of funerary monument which reveal the true nature of these scenes. One example will serve to illustrate how vase-painters addressed this particular problem. Squat lekythos, Paris Market, Galerie François Antonovich. Plate 78a &amp; b. The scene has an Ionic column in the centre and a group of three figures who we can assume to represent the participants in the funerary ritual. To the left of the column a seated woman offers a skyphos. On the right of the column are a horse and its master, who is fully armed, and a woman who carries an unrecognisable object in her arms. The horse turns its head towards its master who pats its muzzle. The warrior does not respond to the offering of the skyphos and this, together with the presence of the column, are the main indications that this is a funerary, rather than a libation, scene.

They are portrayed in a way which is completely different from the portrayal of colonial Greek men. The colonial Greek male is shown naked or with a piece of drapery over his arm and shoulder and around his hips. The native male is dressed in a patterned tunic secured at the waist by a broad bronze belt. The warriors shown on Campanian vases may be called 'Samnites' but we have no name for those shown on Apulian vases; however, for our purposes, we may call them Apulian Samnites'. It seems quite possible that the two types are related but there are differences in character. This is especially true of their costume, and notably their tunic and belt. Both tunics are decorated but the patterns differ. It is not known if these patterns were woven or dyed into the fabric (cf. Ch. 1,2). Although ancient historians describe the Samnite tunic, they do not mention the differences between the Campanian and Apulian types which are immediately evident to students of South Italian red-figure ware. The parallel lines of the pattern in the tunic are horizontal on the Campanian examples and vertical on the Apulian (v. figs 74 &amp; 75). On both types there are small decorative motifs between the parallel lines. The iconographical relationship as explored through three vases 1) Campanian bell krater, BM 1953 4-29.1. Plate 19. Fig. 74. A seated Samnite warrior receives a ritual gift from a Samnite woman, while a second warrior to the right of the scene puts on his greaves. The first warrior, who is in the centre of the scene, wears a feathered and crested helmet, a tunic with typical Campanian patterning, a broad belt and greaves. He holds one spear in his right hand. He rests his left arm on the top of his shield. His seat is covered with drapery and he has drapery hanging across his lap. The second warrior wears a simple calotte helmet, a patterned tunic with Campanian patterning, a broad belt and greaves. His left leg is raised on a rock as he puts on his greaves. He looks back over his shoulder at the central figure. The woman wears full native costume, including a cape, a broad belt and an elaborate head-dress. She also wears a necklace in added white. She has her left leg raised and she bends towards the warrior. Detroit Painter. LCS (3/295), p.403, (no ill.). Photograph courtesy of the trustees of the British Museum. For this vase cf.

The central figure wears an Apulian style tunic. He also wears a broad belt, boots and a chaplet in his hair. He is seated on some drapery and has further drapery across his thighs. His left arm rests on the top of his shield while in his left hand he holds two spears. In his right hand he holds a phiale into which the woman pours wine from an oinochoe. The woman in this instance wears Greek dress and holds a situla in her left hand. The second warrior is dressed almost identically to the central figure.

Identical features These three vases share a number of common features. On all three vases the figure is seated and show with his left side in three-quarter view. The head is shown in profile. The right arm is bent. The elbow of the left arm is resting on the shield, the decorated outside of which is shown. The seat is covered with drapery. In vases 1 and 2 only drapery lies across both thighs with one end hanging down from the left thigh. A difference between vases 1 and 2, and vase 3 On vase 3 there is no drapery across the thighs and the right foot is put forward instead of the left.

The feathers on his helmet suggest that he has been victorious in one or more battles. He carries only one spear, whereas commonly Samnites were depicted with two. If the scene represents a ritual conducted immediately after a battle to honour a victorious warrior, one could perhaps suggest that one spear has been left on the battlefield. In some of the scenes described in Ch. 3, 3 spears were shown discarded on the battle field. Vase 2) The warrior shown is young and has a chaplet in his hair. He has no helmet and carries both spears in his left hand. This is in contrast to the figure on vase 1 who holds one spear out in his right hand perhaps as a sign of victory. The young warrior is not fully armed, indeed his companion has only a shield, and is receiving a libation drink. Vase 3) Again the warrior is shown in a reasonably peaceful state. He wears a high pilos which was probably made of animal hide. The dots in added white may be meant to represent small tufts of the original fur still adhering to the skin. He has two spears resting against his left shoulder. These three vases suggest to us either that the painters worked in an iconographical tradition or that the Samnites did sometimes sit on drapery while receiving some ritual honour. However, we cannot tell which is more likely to have been the case. These vases show Apulian and Campanian Samnites in more or less identical situations, yet there is one fundamental difference between the ways in which the warriors of the two groups are shown. The Campanian Samnite is shown in full panoply, despite the fact that this is not a combat scene. The Apulian warriors, although they carry spears, seem to be dressed more for everyday life. It is not just in this type of scene where this distinction can be observed. Greeks and Samnites together On both Campanian and Apulian red-figure vases we sometimes see representations of Samnites and colonial Greeks together. It seems likely that such scenes reflect real life contacts between the two populations. At present, there seem to be a few more Apulian vases showing this type of scene than Campanian ones and the Apulian examples also depict a greater variety of situations. Moreover, it is possible to observe slight differences in the way Apulian and Campanian Samnites are depicted in such scenes. Although, relatively few vases showing such scenes survive to us they are enough to give us a flavour of the social relations which existed between the Greeks and the natives in 4th century BC South Italy. Although the most common scenes show Samnite men with colonial Greek women, there are also scenes showing Samnite and colonial Greek men together, although relations between them are frequently hostile (cf. Ch. 3, 3). Interestingly we also see Samnite women with colonial Greek women, and occasionally Samnite women with colonial Greek men. Two Campanian examples Bell krater, Sydney 46.01. Plate 109.

Some conclusions Three main points may be made. Firstly, there is clearly a religious or cult background to these scenes. Objects associated with the cult of Dionysos are shown in the hands of Campanian and Apulian tribal figures as well as colonial Greeks. Secondly, women are present in all the scenes which signifies the importance of their rôle within the cult. The woman shown can be native or colonial Greek whether it is a Campanian or an Apulian vase. Thirdly, the Apulian Samnites seem to be depicted in a less warlike context than their Campanian counterparts. The latter group are never, at least to our knowledge, shown only partially armed or completely unarmed. This may be compared with the tribal youths shown on some Apulian vases. For example, none of the Apulian Samnites shown on the above examples is fully armed. Most, but not all, wear a pilos-helmet but only one carries any weapons (v. plate 50). This is one of the most significant differences in the way Campanian and Apulian Samnites are portrayed. Whereas most of the differences appear somewhat superficial, this one may tell us some something about the life-styles of the two groups. The majority of the other differences between Campanian and Apulian Samnites can be attributed to local preferences in terms of the costume. The Campanian tunic was horizontally striped, the Apulian vertically. Apulian Samnites show a greater preference for the muscled cuirass, while the Campanians opted for the triple-plate variety. Celtic helmets and piloi are also slightly more common on Apulian vases. These differences in costume, while enabling us to distinguish between the two groups, do not suggest any fundamental differences in their life-styles. However, the fact that Apulian Samnites are sometimes shown unarmed is perhaps more significant. While it is entirely possible that this simply reflects different iconographie traditions between Campanian and Apulian vase-painters, it is equally possible that in the 4th century the Apulian Samnites were slightly less warlike than their Campanian counterparts. If it is the case that the vase- painters were reflecting the actual situation then it is particularly interesting that Apulian Samnites are shown more frequently in friendly social relations with colonial Greeks. To what extent the Greek and native populations were mixed at this time is impossible to say but these clearly demonstrate that some social and/or religious and ritual contacts did exist. The Dionysiac symbolism evident in many of the above scenes supports the suggestion of a high level of interaction at least in the ritual sphere at this stage. It is noteworthy that Apulian Samnites are shown enjoying a symposium as a ritualised leisure activity (e.g. plate 166). The very concept of a symposium was, after all, Greek. On the other hand, despite all the evidence for contact, one cannot fail to notice how strikingly different from the colonial Greeks the Samnites are.</page><page sequence="153">Abbreviations In general the name/date style of bibliographic referencing is used throughout this book.
