<plain_text><page sequence="1">Political Pluralism: A Study in Modern Political Theory. By K. C. HSIAO. Harcourt, Brace, &amp; Company, I927. Pp. Viii, 27I. In spite of the sweet reasonableness of Professor Hsiao's critique of political pluralism the reader may be pardoned if at the end he remains somewhat puzzled. For pluralism is a subject which can be discussed on various levels. It may be discussed on a certain philo- sophical level at which the differences between it and the antithetical doctrine of monism are regarded as relative and capable of harmoniza- tion within a broader interpretation of monism itself. Or it may be discussed on the definite political level where these differences express themselves in incompatible or contradictory conclusions regarding the business and limits of the state. But on these two levels we are obviously dealing with different though related concepts. And the difficulty I find in Professor Hsiao's otherwise admirable and judicious statement is that he seems to pass imperceptibly from one level to an- other, and more particularly that on what may be called the philo- sophical level he finds a mode of reconciliation of the opposing doc- trines, in monistic terms of course, which in no way resolves the con- flict of the political level but rather obscures its significance. In a study of this kind much depends on the definition of our terms. Professor Hsiao in his introductory chapter defines a monistic state as " one which possesses a unitary and absolute sovereign power,</page><page sequence="2">604 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXVIII. either as the direct source of all political authority as such or as the source of legal authority ". This in turn provides the definition of the pluralistic state as one "in which there exists no single source of authority that is all-competent and comprehensive". We start then with political conceptions, conceptions of political authority, of sov- ereignty and law. The pluralists attack from various angles the doc- trine which makes the state the final and all-inclusive regulator of the social order, and their attack gains weight from such factual consid- erations as the growth of corporations, the separation of church and state, the limitations set on state-action by constitutions, and so forth. Now Professor Hsiao proceeds to show that the main advocates of pluralism, Gierke, Krabbe (whose inclusion in the list is on any defini- tion doubtful), Cole, Laski, and Duguit, are not in the last resort pluralists at all, that they all believe in and at least by implication ac- cept some ground of unity in the social order, that in fact monism and pluralism are merely relative terms. But the point surely is that they are not relative on the level where the real political issues belong. A reconciliation in Dr. Hsiao's terms, when applied to the issues in question, must mean one of two things. Either it leads us back to the Hobbesian or Austinian sovereign, back to the old and dubious monism, or it takes sovereignty in a sense which is no longer strictly political. The latter is the direction which Dr. Hsiao follows in somewhat Hegelian fashion. " Sovereignty ", he suggests, " is not merely gov- ernment . . . but represents the harmony of the articulate wills of individuals projected into a functional system." Leaving aside the question as to the reality of this harmony, we must protest that on such terms the conception of sovereignty, and with it that of the state, has lost its only clear and only practical reference, an unfortunate and sometimes even dangerous ambiguity which had previously brought confusion into the writings of such neo-Hegelians as the late Dr. Bosanquet. The difficulty is brought into the light when we turn to the conclud- ing chapters of Dr. Hsiao's book. In the chapter on " the philosophi- cal background of political pluralism " he offers an excellent criticism of James's pragmatism in which he calls that doctrine "by far the most audacious piece of anthropomorphism ever attempted in modern philosophy ", and slyly proves, in passing, that if Columbus had pro- ceeded on strictly pragmatic principles he would never have discovered America. Here, dealing with philosophical concepts, the author is clearly at home, and his criticism, whether we accept it or not, is free from confusion. But in the next chapter, entitled " political pluralism</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 605 and the state as an ethical ideal ", we enter dangerous ground again. The very phrase, "the state as an ethical ideal ", is an intimation of danger ahead. Dr. Hsiao turns to Aristotle and Hegel as against both the Hobbesians and the pluralists. But Aristotle does not help so much as he seems, because his term 'polis' never possessed the connotation or the specificity of our term 'state'. Nor does Hegel solve our prob- lem of political unity, because he can make the term 'state' mean sev- eral different things at once. " In the Hegelian state-conception ", as Dr. Hsiao reports, "it is important that we clearly distinguish its three necessary elements, namely (i) the state in its natural-material aspect, as represented by the family and social-economic groups; (2) the state in its legal-political aspect, as embodied in the entire govern- mental system; and (3) the ethical state itself, which transcends and includes both." Supposing now we want to talk about the state in the second of these senses, in other words in its specific and normal sig- nificance, we have no right to assume that we are at the same time talking about the first or the third. Nor does it avail in a controversy over the 'state' (2d aspect) to appeal to the 'state' (3d aspect). It is no solution, when pluralists are challenging the supremacy of the political organization, to say that nevertheless the state is supreme, but not as political organization (p. 214). It is no solution, when we are facing the very practical problem of the separation of church and state (2d aspect), to be told that the church is an integral element of the state (3d aspect), as we are told on p. 211. The present reviewer believes that on the contrary language of this sort prevents the dis- covery of the true character of social unity, which depends on the recognition of the state, that is, the legal-political fabric, as an instru- mentality of the community. It is, he would maintain, because the ultimate (though still imperfect) unity lies elsewhere that the state can exhibit, without disruption, a divided sovereignty, as in a federa- tion, that it can admit the autonomy within their spheres of other organizations, such as the church, and that it can have limits set to its range of authority, by constitutions or otherwise, without being broken by the logic of the Austinian doctrine.
