He querido evadir el determinismo geogr4fico, pero estamos en otra isla: ustedes y nosotros. -Manuel Ramos Otero, "La otra isla de Puerto Rico" The Coqui Controversy: A Case Study in Globalized Reterritorialization As almost anyone who has ever visited or lived in Puerto Rico can readily affirm, the coqui is a prevalent inhabitant of the island. This small native frog makes its presence known through the distinctive nocturnal calls that have become closely associated with the landscape in Puerto Rico. Even when they remain concealed-either by foliage and natural camouflage or within the interstices of urban density-their daily ritual of vocalizing at dusk makes their ubiquitous presence undeniable. The coqui is not merely a natural phe- nomenon; the frog is also a symbol of Puerto Rican identity. The close link between the coqui and the Puerto Rican habitat has afforded it a privileged status as a cultural icon. Hence, not only is the coqui avowedly Puerto Rican, but it also is evocative of the specific locality of the island. i. Earlier versions of this essay were presented at the American Comparative Literature Association conference in April 2002 (as part of "The Space of Caribbean Diasporas" seminar that my col- league Eva-Lynn Jagoe and I organized) and at the University of Illinois. I am extremely grateful to the participants in our seminar and to my colleagues at UIUC for their insightful comments and suggestions. Hispanic Review (summer 2004) 375 Copyright © 2004 Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania</page><page sequence="2">376 HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2004 The coqui's iconic status is manifested by a wide array of representations of the frog on the island. Shops in Old San Juan and near other tourist attractions usually offer a variety of anthropomorphized renditions of the coqui engaging in activities such as playing traditional local instruments, dancing, or simply reclining in a hammock. Although certain representations faithfully imitate the appearance of the frog, many of the reproductions bear little resemble to the biological referent. In fact, a particular iconography of the coqui has developed: it is most commonly depicted as a bright, green frog with a relatively small head and seemingly uncharacteristic features such as directly forward-facing eyes and small ears. The marketing of both the more realistic and the primarily cartoon-like figures appeals to a foreign de- sire for transportable souvenirs of the purportedly exotic destination that visitors tend to seek: they codify a rarified local specificity through a repre- sentation that is both charming and readily comprehensible (Lury).2 Interestingly, the consumers of these figures are not only foreign tourists. The coquis also appeal to Puerto Rican consumers.3 Local consumption of the imagery occurs because the coqui offers a particular representation of puertorriqueiidad.4 The coqui is a symbol traditionally associated with Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican identity. Moreover, this symbolism is directly connected to the putative biological and/or mythological autochthony of the frog. Certainly, the pervasive presence of the animal throughout the island reinforces its association with the Puerto Rican landscape. More importantly, traditional cultural folklore asserts that the species is utterly incapable of surviving in any other environment. According to popular lore, the coqui 2. By referring to the figures as cartoon-like, I do not mean to suggest that they are parodied or ridiculed in this representation. Rather, I am referring to the fact that these depictions resemble the anthropomorphic renditions of the coqui rather than the biological specimens found through- out the island. 3. The plural in Spanish is "coquies." Nevertheless, I will render the plural as coquis here to reflect the incorporation of the Spanish term into English discourse and grammar. 4. Of course, local folklore and symbolism are very often the sources of souvenir objects. The commodities produced by this tendency, however, are not always valued by local consumers. On the contrary, a stark contrast can frequently be traced between the cultural functions associated with these objects that are enacted by members of the community and the packaging of the same objects for foreign consumers. In fact, studies such as Being Indian in Hueyapdn and the ethno- graphic film Cannibal Tours highlight the complex processes through which members of a com- munity perform their cultural practices in order to meet the expectations of an external consumer but which are completely disconnected from quotidian existence. What is striking in this case, therefore, is the appeal of these objects to members of the local community as well as visitors and/ or emigrants.</page><page sequence="3">Goldman: VIRTUAL ISLANDS -" 377 will simply die if transported to a different ecological environment such as- for example-New York. But Puerto Ricans also insist that the tiny frog is equally unable to withstand a shift to neighboring islands such as St. Thomas or Hispaniola, which offer an ostensibly equivalent biological setting. In other words, although no clear scientific evidence has been offered to sup- port such claims or explain why the animal would be affected by biologically irrelevant political borders, many local residents assert that the coqui will undoubtedly perish if removed from the territory of Puerto Rico. Hence, according to these claims, the coqui is Puerto Rican to an extreme: it thrives in Puerto Rico and perishes anywhere else. According to this mythology, therefore, the production of locality takes precedence over ecological habitat and ultimately constitutes the true basis for (symbolic) cultural survival. Recently, this myth has been empirically refuted by an unexpected popula- tion explosion of coquis in Hawai'i.5 Although it is unclear precisely how or why the original progenitors were transported to this other insular environ- ment, the coqui-rather than perishing-has thrived in its new location. Ironically, however, its new human neighbors are less than thrilled with the unexpected survival skills of the frog. The Hawai'ians, who have no reason to cherish the coqui as a cultural symbol, view its sudden proliferation as a troublesome infestation that threatens both ecological sustainability and tourism. The coqui is decried as an alien frog that endangers the existence of the more legitimate inhabitants of the island. The Hawaiian Ecosystems at Risk (HEAR) Project describes the escalating "anthropocentric concerns" as- sociated with the coqui's inappropriate and disturbing vocalizations: E. coqui has a loud, piercing call that often disturbs people's sleep (calls are typically measured at 9o-loo decibels at a distance of o.5m [1.5'] from the frog). This same problem has been noted for other species of Eleutherodac- tylus introduced to areas outside their native ranges. Several populations of frogs have come to our attention as complaints from disturbed residents, visitors, or hotel managers. All of these have been for small choruses of frogs. Large choruses can be deafening but are restricted so far to a couple of nurseries and a few residential areas. (www.hear.org/frogs)6 5. In addition to the numerous friends, colleagues, and students who contributed to the develop- ment of this piece, I would like to specifically thank Arnaldo Cruz Malave, who brought the proliferation of the coqui in Hawai'i to my attention. 6. Hawai'ian environmental organizations-as with many similar groups elsewhere-have aggres- sively asserted their concerns about the perils of globalization. Therefore, the campaign against the coqui must be understood in the larger context of the desire to preserve the existing ecological</page><page sequence="4">378 HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2004 In this manner, the very characteristic that is considered euphonic in Puerto Rico becomes strident and inappropriate in the Hawai'ian setting. Paradoxi- cally, the mythology of the coqui is reproduced by the Hawai'ians through this hostile rejection of it as an unwelcome immigrant: the coqui is viewed as being out ofplace, not part of the more autochthonous (and, by extension, more appropriate) ecosystem, and it is therefore characterized as an invading element that must be eliminated. Rather than being sold in iconographic form to residents or tourists as a charming representation of local folklore, the coqui becomes a pernicious pest when reterritorialized in the Hawai'ian context, and this transformation does indeed threaten its continued survival.7 In addition to being represented, examined, and discussed in its respective habitats, the role of the coqui is also reconstructed in cyberspace. The coqui often adorns Puerto Rican websites, where it is used as a symbol of cultural identity, although it is not usually explained or identified per se. In this con- text, the coqui forms part of an iconography ofpuertorriqueiidad (along with depictions of the shape of the island, silhouettes of the gun turrets and bas- tions of the El Morro fortress, and other images that would presumably be readily recognizable as culturally specific markers of identity). On these sites, whether the coqui is depicted in a more realistic form or drawn in a manner similar to the cartoon-like figures, the frog is almost always presented as a symbol of cultural pride or nostalgia. On websites that address the presence of the coqui in Hawai'i, however, this same frog is shown in graphic technical photographs and accompanied by definitions of its biological classification along with characterizations of the frog as a "threat" and a "pest." In equally stark contrast, the auditory components of these territorialized representations offer rather distinct characterizations of the coqui. Puerto Rican sites often feature a few seconds of coqui sounds that play as the page opens. In language evoking nostalgia and the intimate domestication of the tropical island, one site in particular offers visitors the opportunity to open an audio file and listen to an extended sample of the typical "chorus" of coquis that can be heard after sunset. One of the sites dedicated to the coqui system, resulting in a condemnation of all recently arriving species based on the perception of them as a potential threat to environmental stability. Nevertheless, the prejudicial subtext that can be read in the attitude toward the coqui should not be ignored. 7. Most of the methods to eradicate the coqui's presence in Hawai'i have not proven successful. Recently, therefore, HEAR and other environmental organizations have begun to consider alterna- tive strategies for coping with the unwelcome immigrant population.</page><page sequence="5">Goldman : VIRTUAL ISLANDS -- 379 problem in Hawai'i also allows visitors to open files containing either a single coqui or the more typical concatenation of calls. But, in the latter case, the link to open the auditory component is accompanied by an editorial com- ment that exclaims: "If you enjoy peace &amp; quiet, just imagine trying to sleep through this every night!!" (www.hear.org, emphasis in original). Of course, the story of the coqui in Hawai'i is not entirely unprecedented. In fact, the transplanting of Puerto Rican inhabitants to these other islands had occurred long before the coqui ever made its first documented appear- ance in the Pacific. According to James L. Dietz, Hawai'i was identified as a logical destination for Puerto Rican workers who were being encouraged by government-sponsored organizations to emigrate during the first half of the twentieth century. Not only would the developing political link to the United States presumably facilitate this redistribution of labor, but the strategy was based on the belief that the similarities in geographic and agricultural cir- cumstances would make Puerto Rican workers ideally suited to the Hawai'- ian labor environment and allow them to adapt readily to conditions there. Given the significant cultural differences, however, the transition between the islands was not necessarily as easy as the economic strategists imagined. In fact, the relocation of Puerto Rican workers to the South Pacific engen- dered tensions homologous to those raised by the subsequent arrival of the coqui. In a sense, these concerns could conceivably be paraphrased as ques- tions of adaptability that would apply in both cases: would they thrive or perish in the new environment? Would their arrival and propagation threaten the (more) native inhabitants of the island? Were they viewed as an excessively disturbing presence that would upset the natural tranquility of their new insular environment? The question of this group's status and its ability to survive in spite of this uneasy displacement continues to be an important issue among scholars long after the initial wave of emigrants. In fact, Arturo Morales Carrion cites the Puerto Rican community in Hawai'i as an exemplary case of puertorriqueiidad in the diaspora: "Hawaii has a very important Puerto Rican community that has grown through several generations without losing its identity" (348). Hence, the coqui functions as a cultural symbol that (re)enacts the very processes of increasing translocation that the Puerto Rican community has experienced over the last century. As a national symbol, the coqui is inextri- cably bound to a particular location and locality. Through processes of glob- alization such as migratory patterns that are inexorably linked to accelerating mechanisms of international trade, the frog becomes disconnected from this</page><page sequence="6">380 HISPANIC REVIEW : summer 204 locality and is reterritorialized in terms of an evolving system of international capital and power. Moreover, the sudden mobility of the autochthonous icon by means of the Internet engenders problematic reinterpretations of an already complex cultural commodity. Both the problem of multiple (re)in- terpretations itself and the representation of the coqui's translocal transfor- mation on the Web point to a phenomenon through which erstwhile location-specific identities are reconfigured via the Internet. The particular spatiality of the World Wide Web allows for formerly non-contiguous spaces to be brought together without necessarily compromising their position or geographic specificity. The cyber-construction of puertorriquefidad under- scores the mechanisms through which the structures of self-definition are alternately reinforced and radically alerted by demographic shifts in the com- munity. In order to fully contextualize the significance of this cyber-construction, I will now briefly turn to a discussion of the rhetoric of insularity and its historical role in Puerto Rican discourse. Drawing upon this rhetorical tradi- tion, I will then more closely examine how this spatiality is reconstituted on contemporary Puerto Rican websites through the reterritorialization of both the coqui and insular iconography in a manner that simultaneously reifies and reconfigures previous constructions of insular spatiality. Insular Topographies and Puerto Rican Spatiality In The Production of Space, Henri Lefebvre argues that space constitutes a system of codification. He insists that pure or absolute space does not exist in the sense that it has no semantic value. Instead, over time, meaning is produced or constructed through the interpretation and signification of par- ticular natural or physical characteristics. Hence, according to Lefebvre's as- sertions, islands acquire meaning as they are defined and potentially reinvented in a series of new sociopolitical contexts.8 At the same time, a semantics of insularity emerges over time through the discursive association between the specific geographic circumstances of islands and particular signi- 8. I do not mean to suggest that Lefebvre makes this assertion about islands per se. Instead, as I will argue here, a careful analysis of insular space in terms of Lefebvre's theory of spatiality suggest that it functions in this manner.</page><page sequence="7">Goldman: VIRTUAL ISLANDS - 381 fying characteristics. In Western literature in particular, islands become a repeating trope through which authors offer a vision of societal definition. In 1516, for example, Thomas More published the first edition of Utopia. Following in the tradition established by works such as Plato's Republic, More depicts a fictitious society that becomes a heuristic device through which he comments on and critiques his own. Nevertheless, More does not reproduce Plato's "disclaimer" in which he explicitly declares that he will describe a non-existent republic in order to construct an exemplum of an ideal society; instead, he methodically examines every detail of his imagined island. Perhaps because of the extraordinary detail and style of the descrip- tions, More's depiction of the hypothetical island acquires an intensely visual quality. Beyond a description that alludes to or evokes physicality, his text produces the very spatiality of Utopia. Nevertheless, regardless of how "real" More's Utopia becomes as a repre- sentational space, the author onomastically negates the possibility of a spe- cific extratextual referent or location for the island: utopia literally means non-place or nowhere. Although-for the most part-the intelligentsia among More's readers interpreted the island's name as a clear indication of its fictionality, many believed that the specific place More described could be located in the physical world. As Carlo Ginzburg points out, the publication of early editions of Utopia sparked fierce debates among certain scholars regarding its precise location.9 Given this confusion, Ginzburg questions the ambiguity in More's text. Of course, there are any number of reasons why this strategy may have appealed to More at the time. Ginzburg's analysis, however, does not point to an explanation of More's particular historical situation or his authorial intent. He focuses instead on the implications of the ekphrastic production of an island. That is, More creates a separate, dis- tinct world that-because of its spatiality-becomes as "significant" as the natural one. Furthermore, since the textual spatiality both builds on and dialogues with existing codification of physical space, the island is inevitably juxtaposed with the space inhabited by More and his readers. In this way, 9. It should be noted that this reaction to an idealized, allegorical space is not uncommon. In fact, the Garden of Eden may stand as a paradigmatic case of such a response in Judeo-Christian traditions. That is, many readers interpret the place described as a fictional heuristic device that comments on existence in the natural world by depicting a place that only exists outside of it. Others, however, have insisted on the literal component of the allegory and have engendered extensive discussion as to the precise location where the Garden may have once existed.</page><page sequence="8">382 - HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2004 the fully realized spatiality of Utopia enhances its function as a heuristic device for critical commentary. I would argue, therefore, that More's Utopia constitutes both a precursor to and a paradigmatic case of the virtual island. It is a representational space in which insularity is the defining characteristic. Nonetheless, the precise signification of this insularity is not predetermined but constructed and reconstructed rhetorically within the text. Similarly, in Puerto Rican literature, textual constructions of the island can function as a tool of social critique. Throughout Caribbean literatures produced during the five centuries since Columbus's arrival, insularity con- stitutes not only a defining aspect of Antillean geography but the foundation of a significant rhetorical tradition. In Puerto Rican literature specifically, insularity enacts a demarcation of national space that has not been achieved politically. Not surprisingly, many examples can be found in which the de- limiting of insular characteristics are directly connected to Puerto Rican sub- jectivity. The most salient and significant example of this discursive tradition, one might argue, is the work of Antonio S. Pedreira. In his essay, Insularismo, he postulates insularity as the foundation of local sensibility. Moreover, Pe- dreira takes this hypothesis to its furthest consequences and presents a defi- nition of Puerto Rican identity based on this geographic circumstance. But Insularismo is not just an exercise in national definition; the rhetoric of the text creates instead the nationalistic cause of salvation. That is, Pedreira ar- gues that Puerto Ricans have not realized their full potential, and the essay is designed both to explain the consequent discrepancy and to indicate a possi- ble resolution. To this end, Pedreira presents a diagnosis of the problem-or infirmity, to use his terminology-affecting Puerto Rican national identity and encourages his reader to attempt to resolve this crisis. What is most significant about Insularismo, however, is not necessarily the specific definition of Puerto Rican subjectivity advanced by the author. In- deed, most of Pedreira's claims have been called into question by subsequent scholars. Nevertheless, even those writers who challenge and reject the argu- ments made in Insularismo assert the importance of the text itself. This im- portance transcends the author's conclusions precisely because Pedreira initiates a legitimate discourse of Puerto Rican self-definition. Juan Flores underscores this function of Insularismo in his analysis of the work: From this point onward it could no longer be said of Puerto Rico that it lacked the kind of self-interpretative essay enjoyed by other Latin American countries. Insularismo put Puerto Rico on the intellectual map, and lent its</page><page sequence="9">Goldman : VIRTUAL ISLANDS -- 383 claim to nationhood, however belated and mimetic, a measure of authority and, one might add, respectability. (18) Insularity therefore becomes a trope that legitimizes the articulation of a specific local identity, and this legitimating function supersedes the elements of the argument itself. At the same time, this assertion of insularity as a defining characteristic becomes the foundational rhetoric on which subse- quent articulations are inevitably based. Even though Puerto Rican insularity is always constructed in rhetorical terms, the space of the island usually corresponds to that of the Puerto Rican nation. In these cases, to some extent, the writers assume that the Antillean island constitutes the primary-or even exclusive-locus of enunciation for all discourses of Puerto Rican identity. Nevertheless, during the twentieth century, a sustained and increasing migration has been produced that would presumably call this supposition into question. Furthermore, this migratory pattern has generated a corresponding shift in the parameters of cultural production. Currently, both the people and their culture are linked to multi- ple geographic locations. Given this translocality of Puerto Rican spaces, we might expect a concomitant shift in the rhetoric of insularity. The rhetoric persists despite this change, however, and is simply reconfigured in the new context. In this manner, the island comes to represent both a specifically local icon tied to the homeland and a more ubiquitous symbol of the mobile, global community of the diaspora. This combination is evidenced in phrases such as "de Puerto Rico pal mundo" and "el boricua mundial" found on several web pages.10 In some cases, more importantly, a paradoxical simultaneity of the insular and the global can be found. The Internet disrupts conventional terrestrial space and constructs an alternative spatiality. According to The History of the Internet, the technology developed out of the need and desire for more effi- cient and secure communication and exchange of information." It allowed o1. The word "pal" is a contraction of "para el" that connotes a sociolinguistic speech pattern or orality, and the term "boricua" is derived from the pre-Columbian name of the island, Boriquen, and is generally synonymous with Puerto Rican. Although it is certainly susceptible to patterns of linguistic change and shifting connotations, "boricua" is most commonly used as a particularly patriotic or passionate way of describing individuals and other objects. 11. In particular, the earliest versions of Internet communication were sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of a project designed to decentralize information. As the depart- ment became increasingly dependent on data storage and transferal, it became concerned that the</page><page sequence="10">384 HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2004 data to be transferred directly between computers via remote servers without the need for the translation or physical movement of information by means of intermediary devices. In its initial incarnations, therefore, movement be- tween and among related sources of information was facilitated, but the physicality of this movement was not codified or represented in highly visible or recognizable terms. That is, although early intranet and internet commu- nication already facilitated the digital conjoining of geographically non- contiguous locations, this reorganization of space was nodirectly repre- sented in the medium itself.'2 Although it was originally employed in the development of video games and other technological interfaces, virtual real- ity involved a graphic representation that established a mimetic relationship with physical space: the virtual environment that was constructed both re- produced and reconfigured the physical world. The development of the World Wide Web and Web browsers brought these two technologies to- gether; the spatiality of the Internet became a highly visible and integral com- ponent of its usage. The potential movement and connections of the Internet are currently represented in terms of spatial metaphors: the Web itself acts as a symbol for the interweaving and multi-directional connections, and lan- guage such as "home," "back," and "forward" reinforces the representation of cyberspace as a more fluid physical reality. The spatial metaphorical characterization certainly affects the use of the Internet and makes it more suitable for certain types of content; yet it also extends to the function of the medium in social interactions. As Donna Har- away has argued, the very structures of identity and community formation are transformed by the coevalness of cyberspace. Groups are clearly brought together in time and space across previously insuperable boundaries. At the same time, however, the cohesiveness of these groups relies on relatively sta- highly localized gathering of information in a single system would increase vulnerability to a site- specific attack. Hence, it began to develop a network of connections and routers that allowed information to be stored in several remote servers that were readily accessible to computers in multiple locations. 12. Early versions of Internet services allowed one to access specific networks and pursue informa- tion by following text-based links. You could, for example, enter the Library of Congress database and scroll through the menus until you reached the desired line of information, and select the link that would then produce a new page of text. Internet service providers also offered chat functions, which approximated the more recent space of the cyber-chat room. Again, however, these functions incorporated text only. Hence, although one could communicate with other indi- viduals over long distances in real time, this ability did not differ significantly from the capabilities of the telephone or teletype machines used by the hearing impaired.</page><page sequence="11">Goldman : VIRTUAL ISLANDS -0 385 ble mechanisms of identification such as gender, race, ethnicity, occupation, class, and nationality.13 Through this experience of virtual space and move- ment, moreover, the simultaneous conjoining of multiple locations has be- come more apparent and-at the same time-forms part of the codification of cyberspace through which digital data is interpreted. In addition to reproducing existing markers of community identity, the spatiality of Puerto Rican websites also codifies the processes of virtual self- fashioning. That is, it simultaneously fosters communication among users and underscores the ways in which traditional locations of puertorriquenidad are transformed in cyberspace. In a personal web page entitled "Mi bohio newyorkino," the bohio of the title is superimposed on the center of a map of Puerto Rico.14 Just behind the island, the New York City skyline occupies most of the horizon with open ocean and sky on either side. Similarly, in a site called "New York Boricua," the main page features a frame in the upper portion which includes the time and temperature in San Juan and Spanish Harlem (as identified in an animated caption beneath each) on either side of the frame, flanking a small oval in the center (fig. i). The left half of the oval features the edge of El Morro and is thus clearly identified as San Juan. As in the case of "Mi bohio newyorkino," the right half includes buildings from the Manhattan skyline. The resulting synthesis constitutes a new spatiality that could not be found in the physical world. At the same time, however, both sites rely on a system of iconographic symbolism: the juxtaposition of New York and Puerto Rico can only be apprehended through the recognition of specific buildings and representations of these places. This use of referen- tiality and the demarcation of space also point to the specifically virtual na- ture of this spatiality. The images depend on an implied visitor who is already familiar with the architectural and geographic landscapes depicted. Meaning is thus transmitted and interpreted through this common familiarity: both the creator of the page and its visitor share an iconographic literacy that can only be understood by having traveled to the places themselves or having accessed sufficient images of them previously. 13. For a particularly thorough and lucid discussion of the complex ways in which traditional structures of identity are both reinforced and subverted by the technology and practices of the Internet, see Juana Maria Rodriguez, "'Welcome to the Global Stage': Confessions of a Latina Cyber-slut." 14. When I was first researching this topic, I identified this site as particularly relevant. More recently, however, I have not been able to access it. The ephemeral nature of cyberspace- although highly relevant-is beyond the scope of this essay.</page><page sequence="12">386 nD- HISPANIC REVIEW summer24</page><page sequence="13">Goldman : VIRTUAL ISLANDS - 387 At the same time, the alternate mode of juxtaposition in each case is also a significant component. The layering of the images in "Mi bohio newyor- kino" establishes a particular movement from the bohio situated on Puerto Rico in the foreground and New York in the background.15 Through this movement and the specific representation of each space, the image also cre- ates a temporality in which the folkloric past of Puerto Rico is conjoined with the modern urban landscape of New York. In this sense, despite their apparent coeval and conterminous juxtaposition, the relative position and imagery of each situates Puerto Rico in New York's past.16 The representation of the Antillean space in "Mi bohio newyorkino" is also both individual and universal since it contains a single person or familial dwelling yet also depicts the space of the entire island; the diaspora, on the other hand, is expressed through the skyscrapers of the very specific location of the other island that is incorporated in the image: Manhattan. Although the skyline has a compa- rable iconographic function to the bohio, the scale in this case has shifted from the representation of a single dwelling to a collective architectural por- trayal that can only be perceived from a vantage point that is outside the island. The image creates a virtual island in which the past and present, indi- vidual and collective, local and universal are conjoined in a single location but are not completely equated or fused. In this manner, not only does the artist create a space that could not exist outside of cyberspace, but the image also codifies the experience of the Puerto Rican diaspora itself. The alternative juxtaposition of insular Puerto Rican places found in "New York boricua" also codifies this experience, although the compositional anal- ysis in this case in notably different. Rather than layer the spaces or reference them through distinct iconographies, the representation of each space points to a parallel equation. Although the exterior wall of El Morro appears in the foreground of the image, the edges of the two islands are juxtaposed through 15. The bohio refers to the traditional huts associated with the folkloric past of Puerto Rico. Although these structures are rarely found in contemporary society as residential dwellings, they often appear in more commercial contexts as a symbol of cultural heritage. 16. As Johannes Fabian has argued, anthropological discourse has traditionally constructed its object of study in terms of an anteriority. That is, although the anthropologist conducts fieldwork in real time and analyzes a culture that is contemporaneous with his or her own, the discourse and methodology of the discipline conventionally have characterized the observed culture as prim- itive and evaluated it as a precursor rather than as a coeval alternative. Similarly, in this case, the two locations occupy the same space and time yet are represented in term of a temporal trajectory that leads from Puerto Rico to New York.</page><page sequence="14">388 H- HISPANIC REVIEW : summer 2004 a hyperbole in which the coast of Puerto Rico is separated from lower Man- hattan by only a small canal. The rectangles to either side of the oval, which alternate between displays of the current time and temperature in the two locations-San Juan and Spanish Harlem-identified in the scrolling cap- tion, characterize each space as equally present and dynamic. Hence, as with "Mi bohio newyorkino," the two principal islands associated with the Puerto Rican experience are joined but not fused; nevertheless, in this case, the jux- taposition is not depicted in terms of temporal or spatial movement but instead as the conjoining of culturally significant locations. In fact, given the linguistic ambiguity of the term boricua, the title could be interpreted alter- nately as "Puerto Rican New York" or "New York Puerto Rican."'7 This ambiguity destabilizes even the grammatical hierarchy in which either the place or the individual would be subordinated to the other in the articulation of identity. The experience of the diaspora in this case is expressed as one that is constantly produced and reproduced in the present and that relies on a fluid interaction between space and its inhabitants. The virtual island constructed in "New York boricua" codifies the experi- ence of the diaspora, while also pointing to the function of the Internet itself. As George Landow has pointed out in Hypertext 2.0, the popularity of the Internet is based largely on its ability to provide access to places and activities that would otherwise remain outside the purview of daily existence. In most of the cases he examines, the "access" provided is directly linked to commer- cial interest and non-normative activities such as gambling and pornogra- phy. Nevertheless, in their relatively explicit commercialism, these sites underscore an underlying function of the web: they allow users to temporar- ily enter a world that they might otherwise not be able (or want to) inhabit outside of virtual reality while potentially maintaining the stability and ano- nymity of a private or familiar location.'8 On the one hand, the small oval 17. The term "boricua" in Spanish can be either male or female but it also can act as either an adjective or a noun. In this case, therefore, it may be an adjective that modifies the noun New York. Conversely, New York may be behaving as an adjective that modifies the noun "boricua" (meaning a person of Puerto Rican descent). 18. A full analysis of the politics of the Internet is beyond the scope of this essay. Nevertheless, the proliferation of pornography, web-cams that broadcast over the Internet, and the extraordinary anxiety around anonymity and identity security all point to the tenuous spatiality of cyberspace. The value of cyberspace lies precisely in its ability to provide unfettered fluidity of movement without completely dislodging existing boundaries; but the precarious balance between the two must be vigilantly maintained.</page><page sequence="15">Goldman : VIRTUAL ISLANDS - 389 containing El Morro and part of the Manhattan skyline that appears at the top of the page alludes to and reconfigures the space of the two islands. On the other, however, it also functions as a window that points to the voyeuris- tic component of Internet access through which visitors may peer into and-to some extent-virtually enter the space of the diasporic experience. The capacity of the Web to accommodate this production of space be- comes perhaps even more apparent in sites entitled "Growing Up Nuyori- can" and "boricuadesterrao." On the center of the principal page of "Growing Up," designed by Samuel Garcia, a small island with a single palm tree appears floating on a very thin horizon (fig. 2). Unlike the cases analyzed above, this island is not geographically specific. It contains no structures or recognizable landmarks; instead, it features only the palm tree at its center and in fact is not much larger than that object (i.e., the diameter of the island closely approximates the height of the tree). Rather than depict Puerto Rico, Manhattan, or any other specific insular location, the image is evocative of the trope of the deserted island. The background of the entire page, against which the insular scene is set, is a panoramic view of the night sky filled with stars and celestial objects. Hence, the small insular icon and its ocean horizon appear to float in outer space. This image, furthermore, serves as a repeating border that appears between sections of the page containing content such as a picture of Garcia's mother, favorite song lyrics, recent news, and announce- ments. In this sense, the virtual island underscores the power of the Internet to overcome traditional separations: the imagery of the deserted island float- ing in the cosmos suggests isolation, disconnectedness, and the loss of the homeland. Yet through its function as a border that frames the content of the page, the island has been reterritorialized as a mechanism that demar- cates-and thus creates-spaces of personal identity, communication, and connection. Similar imagery is used on "boricuadesterrao.com." In this case, the site is not a personal web page but a virtual catalog featuring items of Puerto Rican folklore. The logo at the top of the page features a small island containing two palm trees but no other distinguishing features (fig. 3). The themes of disconnectedness and loss are reinforced by the title of the company: Boricua Desterrao refers to a displaced Puerto Rican who has been removed from his homeland. The company's current purpose, according to the website, is to provide access to cultural crafts and folklore for those individuals residing outside the island who might otherwise not be able to attain such items:</page><page sequence="16">390 -- HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2004</page><page sequence="17">Goldman VIRTUAL ISLANDS 391 I r en</page><page sequence="18">392 Ha- HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2004 Boricua Desterrao began operations in 1999 as a catalog operation, selling miscellaneous home decoration items by local artisans. As some of our catalogs began making their way overseas via family members [. . .] we began to receive inquiries from the United States [ . .] We then realized the need of Puertorricans [sic] abroad to get affordable Puertorrican goods, not easily obtained outside Puerto Rico. We do not sell $1500 paintings, $500 carvings or anything remotely over-priced or exclusive. The publica- tion of a catalog is very expensive, time consuming, inflexible and non- interactive. Hence, our evolution into an Internet Store with its instant feedback and very attractive pricing. (http://www.boricuadesterrao.com/ About_Us.html) Hence, despite their distinct purposes, both "Growing Up" and "boricuades- terrao" present cyberspace as a means to overcome the isolation and discon- nection that are potentially engendered by diasporic displacement. I do not mean to suggest, however, that the difference in purpose between these two sites is insignificant. With the exception of"boricuadesterrao," the examples discussed thus far are personal web pages designed primarily for networking and sharing information with other individuals. In each case, the virtual island represents an amalgam of the various sites and places that the page's owner claims as personally significant. Hence, the owners are able to construct a personal homeland that conjoins various real and imagined locations. Although these sites are not designed to generate significant profit, they certainly depend on a commercial economy. The proposed exchange (even if it is only on a personal level) requires that both parties have the necessary access to the web. The sites themselves exist, moreover, thanks to corporate sponsorship that supports secondary advertising: the source of the page is maintained by a server that profits through subscriptions and adver- tising that appear on several of the pages. In this way, the exchange of infor- mation presupposes that both parties have the capability and desire to function as consumers. In the case of more commercial sites, the consumerist role of the visitors is more explicit. In these instances, the raison d'etre of the site is to appeal to the needs of visitors as clients. According to the description cited above, Boricua Desterrao altered its corporate structure in order to meet the needs of its customers more efficiently, and its current incarnation as an Internet store is designed to maximize the selling potential of the Web and thus ap- peal to a mass consumer who is specifically seeking moderately priced</page><page sequence="19">Goldman: VIRTUAL ISLANDS --' 393 goods.19 A particularly poignant example of the evolving packaging of culture to maximize its allure for Puerto Rican consumers can be found on "coqui.net." As with the Hawai'ian controversy discussed earlier, the iconography of the autochthonous creature codifies the complex function of highly local(ized) cultural symbols in cyberspace. Unlike the websites discussed thus far, coqui.net is a commercial portal that features information about and links to various companies and services located in Puerto Rico. Of course, the name of the site itself is significant since it invokes the coqui and-by extension-the cultural mythology and symbolism connected to the tiny frog. In this con- text, the concept of a coqui-net is significant because it suggests that the site constructs a space on the Internet in which the coqui's domain is extended beyond the physical boundaries of the island. The welcome page of the site serves as the default home page for coqui.net subscribers and as the primary entry to the services offered for users from outside the network who access the service via the web. It features a coqui inside a small square in the form of a central processing unit that is wired to a series of buttons that function as links to the various content areas offered-i.e., news, help, information, user's manual, search, etc.(fig. 4). In this sense, the technology of the com- puter is used metaphorically to represent the movement enabled by coqui.net. Navigation through coqui.net mimics the service being provided: just as Puerto Ricans can move around the world without abandoning their cultural home, the coqui is enclosed within a particular finite domain, and is able to gain access to other spaces through electronic connections without having to fully abandon its current surroundings. The problems and possibilities of the coqui's movement through cyberspace are repeatedly codified in the images found throughout the site. In fact, in a former incarnation, the principal page of coqui.net depicted a large specimen (relative to the scale of the illus- tration, that is, since its body obscured approximately half the represented island of Puerto Rico) leaping vertically into the air from the island depicted on a globe.20 In this way, the World Wide Web provides a conduit through which the exclusively autochthonous creature can travel freely without threatening its purportedly site-specific existence. i9. In fact, the company differentiates itself from providers of cultural artifacts that appeal to the exclusive prestige or cult value of more expensive items. Hence, the Internet is presented as the most appropriate forum for the exchange of commodities that the company offers. 20. The coqui.net data mentioned here was collected between March 2001 and February 2002. In addition to the instances mentioned, the statistics on usage and similar information may no longer be current.</page><page sequence="20">394 a- HISPANIC REVIEW : summer 2oo4 Nt. . t 9 § t h i ie m@9 Figure 4 As the home page of an Internet service provider, the imagery on the site is constantly changing to reflect new developments in corporate sponsors and within the services provided directly by coqui.net. Throughout these changes, however, the expanding domain of the coqui-that is, the ability of this inherently local inhabitant to move freely beyond its traditional bound- aries-is a recurring theme. When coqui.net first introduced high-speed In- ternet access-which they referred to as "coquik" service-the innovation was advertised by a coqui sitting astride a rocket that shot across the screen. Once again, the image represents the benefit being offered by coqui.net: not only can the coqui travel through an expanding domain, but new technologi- cal developments will allow this movement to be faster and more efficient. More recently, the help page of the site has begun to incorporate similar imagery. Users who click on the help button connected to the coqui on the welcome page encounter a rather different representation of the creature: as with the coqui leaping into cyberspace that no longer appears on the site, this coqui soars through the cosmos in the foreground of the image and moves away from the globe depicted in the background. It is being pursued</page><page sequence="21">Goldman : VIRTUAL ISLANDS -O 395 Figure 5 by a spaceship, which apparently is firing lasers at it, and the phrase "HELP. ... HELP.... HELP ..." appears diagonally above its head (fig 5). In this case, the representation speaks to the potential hazards of the coqui's ex- panding domain: as users move through cyberspace, they may encounter unexpected dangers. Because of its insertion at the top of the help page, however, this image does not imply that such threats should impede explora- tion. Instead, this section is designed to offer the necessary access to assis- tance that will allow users to overcome any difficulties that they may encounter. In this case, more importantly, the coqui is not characterized as the invading element whose survival depends on its ability to adapt to a new environment. Instead, the conventional paradigm of the deterritorialized im- migrant is inverted: the coqui maintains its native status and the other crea- tures it encounters in its travels are portrayed as alien forces. The perils the coqui may encounter, therefore, are not attributed to its status as a foreigner but to the inhospitable aggression of the other inhabitants of its expanded domain. The coqui can move freely through the cosmos in its natural state without the need of a spaceship or any protective apparatus and can simulta- neously protect itself from more denaturalized forces through its access to the coqui-net. Of course, this use of iconography should be considered in the context of coqui.net's content, avowed function, and apparent usage. As I mentioned earlier, the site is a gateway that acts as the launch page for the company's Internet access and contains links to media and companies in Puerto Rico. Their site has featured language such as "Providing the Finest Internet Access</page><page sequence="22">396 c- HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2004 to all of Puerto Rico" and "Providing Internet Access to Puerto Rico and the Caribbean." Hence, it is a tool that allows users to easily connect to Puerto Rican industry and infrastructure from anywhere in the world, whether they are located in Puerto Rico or in the diaspora. According to coqui.net, the site is utilized predominantly by individuals who were born or lived in Puerto Rico or who have close relatives on the island. More specifically, although the service does not require users to provide demographic information or personal histories, most of the patrons of the "micoqui.com" feature (through which users can personalize their access of the site) identify them- selves as current or former residents of the island. In this sense, coqui.net provides its users with the ability represented symbolically through its ico- nography: they are able to both travel beyond the island and stay connected to it. Where No Coqui Has Gone Before: The Enduring Island and the Performance of Community In the end, the representation of diasporic identities on the Internet both reaffirms and reconfigures existing paradigms of community self-definition. Although this assertion should seem relatively self-evident given the existing research on the topic, the specific use of Puerto Rican insularity in this proc- ess proves more significant. Despite the changes in demographics and in the mechanisms of self-representation, the island continues to function as a principal trope in Puerto Rican self-fashioning. On the one hand, this ongo- ing function of insularity can be viewed as a continuity within the cultural discourse. The global island of cyberspace carves out or demarcates a space on the Web that highlights and preserves a separate, distinctive puertorrique- iidad while at the same time facilitating and inherently insisting on connec- tions with the world (real and virtual) beyond it. That is, these constructions draw on and contribute to the complex representations of the island that had already become a defining characteristic of Puerto Rican subjectivity. However, insularity also codifies the dynamics of the formation and mainte- nance of community in the diaspora. The reterritorialization of the island in cyberspace demarcates a delimited space that is both separate and connected to a wide array of locations. In this sense, via the Internet insularity achieves the paradoxical otherness alluded to in the epigraph quoted from "La otra isla de Puerto Rico." Through the ambiguity of his title, Manuel Ramos</page><page sequence="23">Goldman : VIRTUAL ISLANDS -` 397 Otero questions the idea of the homeland as the exclusive (or even primary) locus of enunciation of Puerto Rican discourse. In cyberspace, the ambiguity of the island's otherness does not destabilize the definition of the community but instead becomes part of the semantic code through which virtual spatial- ity is produced. Through this combination of real and imagined spaces, the global and virtual island conforms to Foucault's definition of a heterotopia: The heterotopia is capable of juxtaposing in a single real place several spaces, several sites that are in themselves incompatible [ . .] Either their role is to create a space of illusion that exposes every real space [. . .] as still more illusory [.. .] or else [.. .] to create a space that is other, another real space, as perfect, as meticulous, as well arranged as ours is messy, ill constructed and jumbled. This latter type would be the heterotopia, not of illusion but of compensation, and I wonder if certain colonies have not functioned somewhat in this manner. (25-27) Based on this understanding of the construction of space, a new relationship emerges between insularity in cyberspace and its rhetorical predecessors. Not only do the virtual islands analyzed here enact the spatialized demarcation of communal relationships described by both Lefebvre and Foucault, but they also function as heterotopias in that they codify the very dynamics of spatial- ity through which the community defines itself. These virtual islands are spaces that simultaneously foster separation from and connection to alterna- tive locations. Moreover, the very processes of globalizing identities are codi- fied through these representations of insularity. In this sense, as with More's Utopia, the island acts as a heuristic device through which an idealized ver- sion of the community can be enacted. These virtual islands also closely par- allel Pedreira's Insularismo in that the island constitutes a device through which Puerto Rican self-fashioning is achieved. Rather than being bound to a particular definition of geographic determinism, the reterritorialization of the island in cyberspace dialogues with the practices of globalization as it simultaneously carves out new real and imagined spaces of puertorriqueni- dad. Hence, virtual insularity highlights the processes through which Puerto Rican spatiality is produced and reconfigured. The prevalence of the cosmos as a recurring theme in the Web pages dis- cussed above is also evidence of this function. Whether as background image or represented as the new domain of the coqui, the iconographic location of</page><page sequence="24">398 "- HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2004 virtual islands in outer space underscores the desire to construct an alterna- tive spatiality that transcends existing boundaries and thus cannot be con- tained by traditional geographical configurations of community. In this sense, the representation of Puerto Rican spatiality on coqui.net, while clearly playful and humorous, can also be seen as quite astute. The cosmo-coqui soaring through extraterrestrial space dramatizes the reterritorialization of virtual islands. Not only does the coqui now have access to the world without having to abandon its native habitat, but its movement extends beyond the conventional parameters of human experience. The construction of Puerto Rican spatiality on the Internet offers the coqui's human counterparts the promise of a similar transglobal (or even extra-global) mobility. The insular- ity of cyberspace maintains the specificity of the Puerto Rican cultural land- scape while also facilitating unlimited connections to and movement through a more universalized space. In fact, there is an inherent homology between the diaspora, the Internet, and the performance of community in a globaliz- ing world. The construction of virtual islands in cyberspace occurs at the point of convergence between the dream of the diaspora and the utopia of the information age: they are a clearly demarcated non-space that is located both nowhere and everywhere, and they allow for the simultaneous perma- nent connection to the homeland without compromising the unfettered movement toward and through other places. The importance of the diaspora in discourses of self-definition is becom- ing increasingly undeniable. Not only is the population of Puerto Ricans living outside the island almost as large as that of those who reside perma- nently in Puerto Rico, but the increased mobility and developing technolo- gies have also engendered the constant and virtually instantaneous exchange of information among communities in spite of the distances between them. In a sense, insularity is rendered insufficient and anachronistic in this con- text. At the same time, nevertheless, the island as a national allegory has proven surprisingly malleable, and-once again-appears available to an in- novative reinterpretation of its significance in a new and radically different context. Through the construction of virtual islands, the spatialized locality of Puerto Rican discourse is reterritorialized in a global context. D A RA E.
