<plain_text><page sequence="1">Commentary: Literary History in a Global Age Jonathan Arac No consensus dominates current thinking toward literary history in our global age, to judge from the remarkable assemblage gathered here. Some contributions are wonderfully erudite, others probe the lacunae in what we as yet know or can think, but all are open essays, trying out live directions for further development. Some exemplify by their performance models of a newly global literary his tory, and some imagine plans for organizing collaborative projects that encompass more of the world than any single scholar can command. Yet others think through the changes that may be required for the genre of literary historiography to comprehend the world that we are striving to know. In "Toward Interpretive Pluralism: Literary History and the History of Reading," Brian Stock masterfully reconsiders his long career's work on the history of reading, while reaching forward to new collaborations with brain scientists. I am especially intrigued by the maneuvers through which he puts "universalism." From its position in classical philosophy of life, in a Gibbonian turn it is replaced by religion, over the centuries in which Christianity and Islam reshape the world. Within the West, the Latin language establishes a new basis for universalism, which then yields to the printing press. Marshall McLuhan still has much to offer. Fredric Jameson, in "New Literary History after the End of the New," combines stringent analysis with bold speculation. Reflecting on the benefit of making stark, difficult decisions concerning construction in literary history, he introduces the problematic contrast of "end" to "new" that several other contributors develop and that will help to guide my own reflections as this response proceeds. Walter F. Veit, in "Globalization and Literary History, or Rethinking Comparative Literary History?Globally," and Anders Pettersson, in "Transcultural Literary History: Beyond Constricting Notions of World Literature," both discuss important examples of world or transnational literary history that are likely to have escaped most American scholars, either because of their language (Swedish, Russian, Dutch) or their sub ject matter (Central Europe, Africa, Latin America). Veit's compelling phrase, "diasporic multilingual literatures" (427), establishes a category New Literary History, 2008, 39: 747-760</page><page sequence="2">748 NEW LITERARY HISTORY for thought that I imagine will extend productively beyond his own work on Australia. Pettersson emphasizes the "freedom" required for literary scholarship?enough of what we "must" do! He leaves a question that some other contributors take up: What can we use our freedom for? What motivates our writing literary history?1 In "Toward a History of World Literature," David Damrosch directly asks why anyone would want to read a large-scale literary history. In suggesting that the fundamental purpose of such work is to gain an "overview," he reaches a familiar, troubling problem: can literary history permit close analysis? The trouble becomes greater the more global, or full-world, the history becomes. He moves toward resolving that problem by proposing a 'Wikipedia model": a survey containing hyperlinks to permit more detailed investigation. Amy J. Elias offers a similar solution in "Interac tive Cosmopolitanism and Collaborative Technologies: New Foundations for Global Literary History," but for a different problem. Her solution arises not from the compositional exigencies of historiography, but from a politics of discourse seeking to escape the "monologic and top-down" (705) structure of ordinary academic writing. Nadia Al-Bagdadi's "Registers of Arabic Literary History" elucidates an astonishing density of information from the history of scholarship, no less than from the primary materials of Arab writing, from over 1,300 years. She demonstrates the precocious exemplarity of Arab culture as global, or at least massively transnational, especially in the literatures of Abbasid Baghdad and of al-Andalus, cases that must figure importantly in any full theorization or typology that acknowledges that our current situation is not the only one that counts. In characterizing "Untranslatables: A World System," Emily Apter high lights a topic that threads through the various papers. For Damrosch, as far back as Gilgamesh, translation is the crucial step in a work's entering "world" literature, and for Pascale Casanova, "Translation is the major prize and weapon in international literary competition."2 Apter focuses on wntranslatability, showing the fascination of Barbara Cassin's collab orative "dictionary of untranslatables," still too little known, I find, even among Francophilie English and American scholars. The book's descrip tion on its back cover begins, "One of the most urgent problems posed by Europe is that of languages." Instead of choosing one "dominant" language, which would be English, Cassin leads her colleagues to opt for "plurality."3 This wonderful work of multilingual scholarship thus arises from the politics of contemporary Europe, committed to union across tongues. The United States still has much to learn here. Wai Chee Dimock's title, "The Egyptian Pronoun," poses an enigma, and when the Western reader discovers that this exotic mystery is "I," the effect is a swirling displacement. In its rapid shifts of scale, this es</page><page sequence="3">COMMENTARY 749 say models the transformative impact of new global literary history. The genealogy Dimock proposes allows Americanists to revalue Walt Whit man's "I," so often scolded as either imperial or narcissistic, and it also allows theorists to redefine relationships among lyric, novel, and autobi ography, some of the major genre-types of modernity. The essay ranges over thousands of years and yet finds the opportunity for close reading. When Dimock appeals to the "undying potency of grammar," arguing "[n]o actual human being can make such a claim; only a pronoun can" (633), she recalls the crucial work of the polyglot Roman Jakobson on relations between linguistics and poetics.4 Yet her own essay lies within the language capacities of any American undergraduate: deeply com parative yet all in English. Nirvana Tanoukhi's "The Scale of World Literature" elaborates the problematic of scale already broached by Dimock, and she further works into the issues of how one constructs a literary history. Is the very idea too teleological? Can the notion of "world literature" synchronically blunt the edge of history's temporal thrust? Tanoukhi develops a moment from Kwame Anthony Appiah that I find worth even further reflection. In re jecting the "postcolonial novel" as offering any "representative sample of African culture" (600), Appiah raises issues of differential literacy, another among the fundamentals to which the global problematic brings us and to which I will return. Not only many Africans but also many Western university students practice literacy in modes very different from those that prevailed among the nineteenth- and twentieth-century social sec tors to which we?who read New Literary History?owe our conception of literature. In exploring "The Place of the Text" in "Planetary Literary History," Frances Ferguson presents a compelling, abstract characterization of what close reading does. She reworks a concern that was crucial in defining the American theory movement. I am thinking of Paul de Man's impasse in Allegories of Reading (1979), where he proved "unable to progress" from close reading to the larger history he had begun by intending.5 This impasse was one of the motives for the work now known as "new histori cism," which aimed to write history, but without totalization. Stephen Greenblatt's Renaissance Self-Fashioningappeared the following year.6 That way of doing things itself came to seem too intensively focused, ignoring the necessary larger perspective. Thus the challenge of globalization. "Shall We Continue to Write Histories of Literature?" asks Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, invoking the sense of an ending that any sharp historical awareness of beginnings may bring with it. He argues that "the very type of historicity" that made possible the "emergence of literary history in the earlier nineteenth century" has quite recently "vanished" (520). He makes most explicit a thought shared with several other contributors:</page><page sequence="4">750 NEW LITERARY HISTORY "a new start for literary history would presuppose a series of discussions, answers, and solutions that cannot be produced by literary studies alone" (528). Therefore, even our most admired predecessors, such as Erich Auerbach or Walter Benjamin, don't offer us "ready-made" answers. Beginning from the evocation of "world literature" in the Communist Manifesto, the single most recurrent topos in the last decade's discus sions of literary globalization, Mark Poster poses the challenge digital machines offer to prevailing ideas of the human. His essay counterpoints Karyn Ball's "Primal Revenge and Other Anthropomorphic Projections for Literary History," which challenges the idea of the human from the other side, that of animals not machines. Alone among the contributors in using an explicitly psychoanalytic model, Ball furthers the question addressed by Luc Boltanski in Distant Suffering and by Bruce Robbins in his ongoing studies of transnational rhetoric: affectively speaking, how do we get to the point of "feeling global"?7 In "Translator, Traitor; Translator, Mourner (or, Dreaming of Inter cultural Equivalence)," Rey Chow proposes one powerful answer to the question of what might motivate literary history in a global age. Her "intercultural equivalence" I find cognate to the "weak messianic power" Benjamin adduced as an effect of brushing history "against the grain," moving towards a "redeemed mankind" for which the past has become "citable in all its moments."8 At least this is my translation of what she means by invoking "the spirit of Chinua Achebe's critique of Joseph Conrad" (575). In the same spirit, I translate the cultural imperialism she finds reprimanded by Derek Walcott: "To be told you are not yet a city or a culture requires this response. I am not your city or your culture" (577). So the Antillean Nobelist answers the North, so the United States answered generations of European travelers, and so has Los Angeles long answered New Yorkers. David Bleich, in "Globalization, Translation, and the University Tradi tion," focuses attention more than does any other contributor on the institution of the university, which supports almost all work done in liter ary history, global or otherwise. Bleich emphasizes the limits of academic freedom, when the academy is circumscribed by coercive sponsorship, which he illustrates over a long history. This would not surprise anyone who read Thorstein Veblen's The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men (1918), or even Christopher Newfield's Ivy and Industry: Business and the Making of the American Uni versity, 1880-1980 (2003) .9 But scholars of my generation and Bleich's came to adulthood with different expectations. We were formed in the university defined by David Riesman and Christopher Jencks in The Academic Revolution (1968). That revolution, it seemed, had won faculty autonomy, freedom from church and state and administration. Instead,</page><page sequence="5">COMMENTARY 751 1968 proved the start of what Newfield has called in a later book Unmak ing the Public University: TheForty-Year Assault on the Middle Class (2008).10 Things seemed hopeless when the American Association of University Professors was founded in 1914; now, as then, effort may do much, but the results are not permanent. Jerome McGann in "Pseudodoxia Acad?mica" indicates that the di vergent network of inquiry gathered here was convened in response to Casanova's World Republic of Letters, and he undertakes a fuller engagement with this work than any of the other contributors does. I strongly concur with him against Casanova's presumptions concerning literary autonomy, and I turn to consider her book to develop this symposium's topic. Globalization, I find from the seventeen essays gathered here, now forces the scholarly imagination freshly to consider fundamental issues of literary history, while also opening the prospect of new possibilities. As Jameson asserted in discussion, no one has ever seen a totality. This is not just because optical limitations prevent our seeing everything at once, but rather because totality is itself a philosophical abstraction. Attempts to represent totality provoke extremely divergent formal solu tions. The middle of the twentieth century marked an earlier moment of grand ambition in Western literary study: the contrast between narrative in Auerbach's Mimesis (1946) and structural schema in Northrop Frye's Anatomy of Criticism (1957) sharply differentiates two masterpieces that despite their limitations (whether acknowledged or only observed by their critics) aimed at something like a full view of literature past and present.11 Frye's polemical argument against value judgment, on behalf of "undiscriminating catholicity," perhaps his version of intercultural equivalence, marks one of the fundamental issues.12 Is literary history the history of everything humans have produced in writing, or is there some criterion by which to define a smaller field? The ambition driving Casanova's World Republic of Letters shines through her forceful criterion to define literary history. In her account, literary history depends "neither on national chronologies nor on a series of neatly juxtaposed works"; rather, it arises from a "succession of revolts and emancipations."13 Literary history is not the history of everything, but only of what is new. Casanova respectfully cites Fernand Braudel ( WRL 11), but the Annales historians emphasize those aspects of history that change only imperceptibly, while her history is highly eventful. Casanova's argument further limits the field by specifying the kinds of revolts and emancipations that make literary history: although they are necessarily bound to language, history-making writers free themselves from "considerations of political utility" and thereby "create the condi tions of a pure and autonomous literature" ( WRL 46). Literary history is the history of autonomization, the growing capacity of literature to</page><page sequence="6">752 NEW LITERARY HISTORY give itself rules set by no other authority. To separate the truly autono mous from its commercial imitations, the literary historian must exercise vigilant discrimination. Casanova shares with Frye the goal of moving from conventional critical focus on individual works. She argues, as does Frye, that to understand a work requires one to "step away" to grasp the "totality," "the entire literary universe" (WRL 3). Yet on the profound question of what you find within the universe of literature, for Casanova, F. R. Leavis beats Frye: many are called but few are chosen.14 Casanova adapts to the world stage Pierre Bourdieu's analysis of how literary autonomy emerged in nineteenth-century France.15 Yet this au tonomy troubles Bourdieu. His single most famous work is Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste (1979; trans. 1984). The title states the work's polemic: it demystifies the class-based power that underwrites judgments supposedly based on the nature of the human mind. It attacks the Kantian aesthetic that also sustains the notion of artistic autonomy. Bourdieu scorns arguments that appeal to human nature, but he respects claims that arise from concrete social struggle, including the trials for indecency undergone by Baudelaire and Flaubert. Casanova goes beyond Bourdieu in endorsing literary autonomy. She casts as heroic revolutionaries against "domination" those writers from the margins of world power who succeed in validating their autonomy in the "'world market of literary goods'" (WRL 127, quoting Goethe), or the "bourse of literary values," a notion she develops through Paul Val?ry (WRL 12-13). The geocultural politics of her literary World Bank leaves no scope for Bourdieu's concern with the class politics within a given society.16 Her book plays out a logic like Hegel's dialectic of master and slave: the "most dominated" is always and necessarily the "most lucid" (WRL 10). Those on top have the luxury of false consciousness; only the underdog can "understand and describe his own position in the world of letters" and be "aware of the general principles that generate the struc ture he describes" (WRL 10). I have my doubts, but this perspective gives Casanova's book its great strength: I know no remotely comparable work so widely globally attentive, including important discussions of Brazil, Spanish America, several nations of Eastern Europe and of Africa.17 Casanova locates the action on the periphery. Ever since France estab lished dominion over world literature in the later eighteenth century, "radical challenges to the existing order have appeared in the most impoverished territories of the international republic of letters" ( WRL 44). The examples of Joyce, Beckett, Kafka, and others demonstrate that "within Europe," "these dominated areas . . . were the cradle of the great literary revolutions" (WRL 84), and more globally, "the greatest revolutionaries of literature are to be found among the linguistically dominated, condemned to search for ways out from destitution and dependence" (WRL 255).</page><page sequence="7">COMMENTARY 753 An epigraph from Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man opens the second half of Casanova's book, which details her model and analyses of "Literary Revolts and Revolutions" ( WRL 173), yet Ellison himself strenuously dis trusted the idea of autonomy. He believed writers must be independent so as to fulfill social and political obligations. Ellison accused Hemingway and other American modernists of irresponsibility for believing that their works could leave behind the social functions of art: "It is not within the province of the artist to determine whether his work is social or not. Art by its nature is social. . . . Once introduced into society, the work of art begins to pulsate with those meanings, emotions, ideas brought to it by its audience, and over which the artist has but limited control. The irony of the 'lost generation' writers is that while disavowing a social role, it was the fate of their works to perform a social function that reinforced those very social values which they most violently opposed."18 In Kenneth Burke's conception of literature as a socially symbolic act, Ellison found a mixture of Marx and Freud that makes some of his analyses resonate with Jameson's arguments concerning the "political unconscious," which also arise in dialogue with Burke.19 Whether Freudian ambivalence or Marxist dialectic, Ellison, Burke, and Jameson share a two-sided view that I find more productive than Casanova's. The autonomization of American literature achieved by Hawthorne around 1850, what I have called "the emergence of American literary narrative," seems to me, contra Casanova, to demonstrate not a break from politics but rather a fascinating and frustrating imaginary relationship to politics.20 Literary history as we know it came into existence about 1800, together with the newly specialized sense of literature that great works by Raymond Williams and Michel Foucault sought to specify.21 While Casanova's analysis fits the Mallarm? ideal Foucault analyzes, I suggest following Williams in a different direction. Literature developed with culture in an tagonistic dialogue with both industry and democracy?2 This means that literature constituted itself against mass production and mass politics. As early as 1839, the leading French critic Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve denounced his age for its "industrial literature" (meaning not literature that represented industrial subjects, but rather literature that we would now say commodified itself) P He credited Balzac with showing this de based literary world in Lost Illusions, and Georg Luk?cs developed this analysis in a major essay on that novel.24 The state and the market loom as the Scylla and Charybdis that Casanova demands literature escape by binding itself to the mast of autonomy. Both politics and commerce tempt literature to succumb to "neorealism" ( WRL 197). What does she mean by this term? She explains, "The 'proletarian novel' advocated by the Soviets was perhaps its most complete incarnation"?that is, for Casanova, not an extreme deforma</page><page sequence="8">754 NEW LITERARY HISTORY tion, but rather an ideal type. To complete the demonic diptych, to her critique of state-sponsored socialist realism, add Michael Schudson on commercially sponsored advertising as "capitalist realism."25 The case of Emile Zola offers a more engaging test for the problem of neorealism. This massive figure strongly divides some of the most important foreign critics of French fiction. Auerbach and Harry Levin honor Zola with Stendhal, Balzac, Flaubert, and Proust, while Henry James and Luk?cs find Zola falls irredeemably below his model, Balzac.26 James is understood as a formalist, but his critical writing placed mimesis at the core of novelistic practice, from the early "Art of Fiction" (1884) to the late "Lesson of Balzac" (1905). James asserted, "the most funda mental and general sign of the novel, from one desperate experiment to another, is its being everywhere an effort of representation?this is the beginning and the end of it," and this is where Zola fails. His "perfor mance," despite its "immense scale," was phony: "an extraordinary show of representation imitated."27 Within the world market of literary goods, the fake is always the dan ger, in James's terms, "manufacture" against "handmade" (134). Luk?cs's Theory of the Novel warns that "the novel?unlike other genres?has a caricatural twin almost indistinguishable from itself in all inessential formal characteristics: the entertainment novel" (Unterhaltungslekt?r?). Their "superficial likeness" can almost "lead to the caricature being taken for the real thing."28 At virtually the same time, D. H. Lawrence wrote to the literary agent he shared with Arnold Bennett, apropos Bennett's views on Lawrence's recently published The Rainbow. "Tell Arnold Ben nett that all rules of construction hold good only for novels which are copies of other novels. A book which is not a copy of other books has its own construction, and what he calls faults, he being an old imitator, I call characteristics."29 Casanova updates this tradition with her critique of the "neocolonial novel," the "work of writers from formerly colonized countries who, while giving the impression of breaking with tradition, reproduce the narrative techniques of the colonial novel in its most conservative form" (WRL 379-80). I find this view unpromising for a new literary history in the global age. Perhaps the story of literary emancipation no longer meets its own criterion of novelty. Instead, we might tell the history of autonomization to show how literature (as defined by its constitutive antagonism to state and market) came to make increasingly less difference to the world. Perhaps the state and the market bring strength rather than weakness. Samuel Clemens's pen name of Mark Twain was a registered trademark. If I must choose between high autonomy and low commerce, history teaches me to take the low road. I join the world in choosing low per formers over the critics who looked down on them: Shakespeare over</page><page sequence="9">COMMENTARY 755 Nashe orjonson, Robinson Crusoe over TheDunciad, Dickens over George Henry Lewes and Fitzjames Stephen, Louis Armstrong and Hitchcock over Adorno. The Sopranos, Deadwood, and The Wire prove to our age that what James called the "strange irregular rhythm of life" may be transmit ted in a medium that has been both commercial and collective from its start.30 The life of poetry in our time is intertwined with world music in ways that academic literary scholarship has not yet addressed. Music is far more commercially mediatized than literature, it is consumed more than literature, and it does not require so much particular knowledge.31 In the global frame for thinking that motivates this symposium, we find that capital circulates much faster than novels do, but music moves nearly as fast as capital. Capital takes us back to Marx and Engels. Starting the story of global ization and world literature with the Communist Manifesto is so familiar that we rarely ask: why is now the global age, not then, back in 1848? The answer is because globalization was then emergent and is now dominant.32 Even after the disasters of twentieth-century state Marxism, the Manifesto retains intellectual power. It is both analytic and prophetic, concerned to read "the seeds of time" (a phrase Jameson takes from Macbeth), but it marches with its age in the power it gives to literature. The Manifesto appeared just as the new conception of literature had come to be dominant. World literature for Goethe arose from new opportuni ties for communication offered by the newly important print medium of the review journal. Goethe explores his intuitions concerning world literature in a register of language surprisingly consonant with that of the Manifesto. In a letter to the young Scottish intellectual Thomas Carlyle, translator of Wilhelm Master's Apprenticeship (1824) and in many other ways the major mediator of the period between Germany and the English-speaking world, Goethe wrote: "Understanding and study of the German language bring a man to the market where the nations all offer their wares; he acts as an inter preter and grows richer himself. ... It is the business of every translator, then, to be an active agent in this universal intellectual commerce, and to help the exchange of these goods. Whatever one may say about the inadequacy of translation, it remains one of the most important and praiseworthy activities in the general traffic among nations."33 Goethe's 1830 preface to the German translation of Carlyle's biography of Friedrich Schiller offered a historical explanation for world literature. Goethe argued that world literature arose because the Napoleonic Wars had forced all the combatant nations into "aware [ness] of much that was foreign," producing "intellectual needs that were previously unknown." To assuage these needs required "free intellectual trade relations {freien geistigen Handelsverkehr) ,"34</page><page sequence="10">756 NEW LITERARY HISTORY The German Handelsverkehr would fit right into the Manifesto: there in discussing world literature, the key operative term is Verkehr. Yet this term, in moving from German to English, carries a tremendous semantic scatter, and geistig, too, is susceptible to diverse translation.35 The current standard reading edition of Goethe in English sharply diminishes the awareness of commodification in "free intellectual trade relations." It shifts the realm of freedom from Economist liberalism to ACLU liberalism in translating "free exchange of ideas."36 The first translation of this passage into English is an extraordinary intercultural document. It was published shortly after the First World War in a volume edited by the American scholar Joel Spingarn (1875-1939). As the first gathering in any language of Goethe's criticism, it sought to heal the savage breach opened by the war. The United States had purged German culture, even banning the teaching of German in many school districts.37 Spingarn was Jewish and a prosperous, progressive, patrician Republican. When he began the project in 1909, he was professor of comparative literature at Columbia, one of the first to specialize in his tory and theory of criticism, and German was the most widely studied language in the United States. In 1911 he was dismissed from Columbia for supporting a controversial colleague against President Nicholas Mur ray Butler, and the Goethe project was put aside. He returned to it while on sick leave from military service during the war, because Goethe's "call to sympathy and understanding" was so urgent and timely.38 Meanwhile, in 1914, Spingarn had become chairman of the recently founded Na tional Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to which he devoted major energies for the rest of his life. The actual translation for the large portion of the volume not previously in English, including the excerpts on world literature, was commissioned from the brilliant young radical public intellectual Randolph Bourne (1886-1918), most famous for his writings against the First World War and for his 1916 essay "Transnational America."39 Bourne's language in translating Goethe evokes the sexual radicalism of early Greenwich Vil lage, or of the angels in Paradise Lost "free spiritual intercourse."40 The "print capitalism" of Goethe's age that made nationalism possible was also producing transnationalism.41 The power of the press, inseparable from the rise of literature, operates in a complex temporality. In 1831 Victor Hugo looked back to 1482, from the triumph of print to its earliest days in the West, and wrote into The Hunchback of Notre Dame his pr?figuration of Marshall McLuhan and Walter Ong: "This will kill that."42 The book will supersede the architectural Bible of the cathedral, and it did, but it took a quarter of a millennium to achieve that cocky dominance. What we know as literary historiography emerged in the age of na tional literatures, roughly the nineteenth century. It needs emphasizing</page><page sequence="11">COMMENTARY 757 that histories of national literatures are not straightforwardly tied to nationalism. Take the case of Spain. Al-Andalus was one of the great moments and places of multilingual, border-crossing writing. But then came the Reconquista, fearsome ethnic cleansing, religious and linguis tic homogenization, the first modern European state, and the empire inaugurating the long globalization, now dominant, that motivates this symposium, over 500 years later. Yet Spanish literary history was long and influentially written by foreigners, not even in Spanish.43 The German role in this historiography leads to the great twentieth-century cross national Romanisten such as Auerbach, Leo Spitzer, and Ernst Robert Curtius. In France, Hippolyte Taine wrote what is still the most intellec tually remarkable history of English literature.44 More recently, Harvard University Press has sponsored major revisionist literary histories of France and Germany, written in English and authored overwhelmingly by American scholars.45 The age that invented world literature has long seemed to posterity the age of the novel.46 This is the justification for Franco Moretti's turn ing his "Conjectures on World Literature" into a case study of the novel, and it is what makes his massive edited project // Romanzo/ The Novel the outstanding example to date of new literary history in a global age.47 Hardly had literature come to replace poetry as the key operative term than literature came to mean novels. Now in American bookstores, the shelves labeled "literature" contain the market niche known as serious fiction, and there are separate sections labeled with what used to be parts of literature?"poetry," "drama," and "essays"?as well as sections naming what used to be parts of the novel: "romance," "gothic," "west ern," "detective," "science fiction." And most bookstores include sections devoted to CDs and DVDs. Differential literacies, in which the people's art is not the novelist's art, are not only African. The global age dares us to write literary history as if the history of literature were over. Of course it is not. The quest for recognition contin ues in Casanova's world autonomy sweepstakes. Some wonderful works will be produced and reach readers, perhaps even more people than ever before, since so many more people now can read. Yet the place of literature within culture and of culture within the world has changed. We love to write histories that cheer on the emergent and challenge the dominant, but have we yet explored how to write histories of the residual? Perhaps this explains why deconstruction exercised such appeal. Deconstruction loved to think the residual. Teleology yields to haunting in Derrida's return to Marx.48 University of Pittsburgh</page><page sequence="12">758 NEW LITERARY HISTORY NOTES 1 Some of my thoughts on this question appear in "What Good Can Literary History Do?"
