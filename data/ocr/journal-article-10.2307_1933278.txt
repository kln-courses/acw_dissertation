<plain_text><page sequence="1">158 REPORTS Ecology, Vol. 42, No. 1 NATURAL SELECTION AS AN ECOLOGICAL CONCEPT HERBERT L. MASON AND JEAN H. LANGENHEIM Depart-ment of Botany, University of California, Berkeley In 1959 the centennial of the publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species was celebrated throughout the world by those interested in evolutionary theory. In 1958 at the zoological congress in London a special ses- sion marked the centenary of the presentation to the Lin- nean Society of the doctrine of natural selection by Darwini and Wallace. During these two years numerous writers have reviewed the history of the concept of natural se- lection and its relation to evolutionary theory. With the notable exception of Stauffer (1959), few have alluded to its relation to ecology. It is likewise apparent that many ecologists have not seen the direct relations of natural selection to their investigations. This is not sur- prising, however, because Darwin presented his theory as an evolutionary explanation of the origin of species, and much of this explanation became incorporated into it. So much confusion surrounds our conceptions of species, evo- lution and natural selection that the relation of the latter to ecology has never been wholly clear. In emphasizing both the problem of the origin of variation and the coni- sequences of natural selection, the nature of the elemen- tal biological operation of selection has not been explicitly expressed. The operational level of this event became obscured and thereby its important relation to ecology likewise was obscured. Recognition that natural selec- tion takes place at the level of the relation of the indi- vidual organism and its environmental conditions places it by definition in the realm of ecology. A survey of the literature of natural selection also dis- plays an undercurrent of perplexed and subtle dissatis- faction with the concept. It is implied that either more thought or further investigation is needed to discover the full significance of natural selection. We think that some of this dissatisfaction may evaporate when it is pointed out that many confusions stem from problems in express- ing and organizing knowledge rather than from the facts pertaining to organisms. Biology is a body of knowledge about organisms and as such must satisfy not only the laws of nature but the laws of knowledge (Mason and Langenheim 1957). Therefore semantic analyses of the concept of natural selection were made according to the principles of the Theory of Signs (Morris 1938). As a result of this examination and the clarification that fol- lows, the concept of natural selection emerges not only in a more simple and orderly role in evolutionary theory, but also as one of the basic unifying concepts of biology. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the stimulating criticism of the manuscript by many friends and students, especially Dr. Edwin Tisdale, Dr. R. L. Langenheim, Dr. Helen Sharsmith, Annetta Carter, Jack Wolfe, V. A. Zullo, Stanton Cook and S. G. Smith. METHOD OF LANGUAGE ANALYSIS It is out purpose to demonstrate the distinction between a concept of natural selection based upon an analysis of confirmable experience, and the many conceptions of it in the history of usage of the term. Perhaps it is important to point out that a distinction is drawn between "concept" and "conception" (Langer 1953). Langer's distinction is that a concept rests upon confirmable experience such that it can be rigorously defined within the limits of our knowledge. A conception, on the other hand, may be our personal understanding or misunderstanding of the con- cept. More often, in the absence of the defined concept, a conception is the understanding of the whole context of loosely aggregated facts and their relations. It may tlhus include extraneous complexities or be incomplete. Some- times it is an incommunicable mental picture which stands as the symbol of the concept. It appears that most authors' conceptions of natural selection have given them so complete a feeling of comprehension that they have thought further clarification in terms of rigorous definition unnecessary. The diversity of conceptions, how- ever, indicates a need for evaluation of the basis of the concept. The semanticist tells us that meaniing is a property of statements; therefore to establish the meaning of an-y term one must place it, as a symbol of a concept, in state- ment form. The specific statement form for an analysis is "x is ... is true if and only if the following is true." There follows an enumeration of the necessary and sufficient truth conditions that establish the truth value of x. Truth, like meaning, then, is also a property of statements. The meaning of the statement is deter- mined through the establishment of the necessary and sufficient truth conditions upon which the statement rests. Rynin (1952) calls attention to the nature of the test for meaning and points out that it does not consist of introspection or merely seeking a feeling of comprehen- sion. Rather, meaning in the last analysis must be thought of as replacement of symbols in statements by events or experiences which are their meanings. These "replacements" provide the conditions whereby the state- ment may be said to be true or false. Hence they are its truth conditions and constitute the basis of the concept. A necessary truth condition is one whose absence ren- ders the statement false. Sufficient truth conditions are those which, when all present, render the statemeint true. Thus a necessary truth condition may be present but alone does not establish the whole truth. Only sufficient truth conditions establish the truth of the statement. The sub- stitution of truth conditions determined for the symbol "x" in the statement form above would make the symbol "x" synonymous with the term to be defined. We thus would have the necessary 1 :1 relation between the term and its definition. ANALYSIS OF DARWIN'S CONCEPTION OF NATURAL SELECTION If we turn to the history of the conceptions of natural se- lection we will see that the traditional views have grown out of the conceptions of various workers. First, it is important to recognize that this history has been inex- tricably connected with that of our knowledge of evolu- tion. According to Jepson (1949) natural selection was described as related to adaptation as early as 400 BC by Empedocles. However, the principle did not receive impetus until Darwin and Wallace suggested that evolu- tion was controlled by the mechanism of natural selection. Although both Darwin and Wallace (1859) presented the same principle, they emphasized different points in its presentation. With due respect to the contributions of \Vallace (1870, 1889), our analyses shall be restricted to Darwin. Unfortunately Darwin, in his eagerness to set forth natural selection as an explanation of the origin of spe- cies, employed language that inadvertently caused his readers to incorporate much of this explanation into their conceptions of natural selection. By failing to clearly define natural selection and by discussing it in terms of</page><page sequence="2">January, 1961 REPORTS 159 its consequences, Darwin's language is often ambiguous as to what constitutes the process of selection and its distinction from the explanation of evolution. However, the most fundamental contribution of a man of genius may not always rest wholly in what he says of a subj ect. Basic ideas resuiting from observations from which he deduced incomplete and unclearly expressed statements may be more important. Thus it behooves us to seek out and try to understand these original perceptions in the hope that we may grasp the fundamental ideas and con- ceptions that they generated in his mind. Often there is concealed information and clarity that may make his discourse serve more effectively the useful purpose he foresaw for it. To get at the facts necessary to our analysis of Dar- win's conception of natural selection, the Origin of Spe- cies (Darwin 1869) was searched for a specific definition. Instead of a definition we were confronted with a wealth of examples of the consequences of natural selection each in turn presented by the author with the expressed hape that it would make clear what he meant by the term. He speaks of it as a principle but does not enumerate either its properties or any details of it as an elemental operation. Several statemenits regarding the fundamental ideas of natural selection appear to be as close to a definition as Darwin comes. The following quotations seemed most significant to us: "I have called the principle by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the tIrm natural selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the survival of the fittest is the more accurate and sometimes equally convenient" (p. 52), and "The preservation of favorable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injuri- ous, I have called natural selection or the survival of the fittest. Variation neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection" (p. 64). It is important to note that in the first statement, by referring to natural selection as a principle having certain consequences and, in the second, as an act of preservation with preserving consequences, Darwin drew a distinction between natural selection and its consequences. By ex- pressing it in this way, natural selection is presented in the sense of an undefined primitive notion which Darwin referred to here as a principle and elsewhere as a "blind force operating in nature." It is this distinction between natural selection and its consequences that gave to the theory the logical power adequate to the impact it has had on biology. This is important because in some subsequent statements by Darwin and those of his successors this distinction has not always been kept clear, thus leading to ambiguous language. As we review these quotations from Darwin and set his facts in the context of a formal statement for analysis we have: x is natural selection is true if and only if: 1. It is a principle whereby a) "useful variations or favorable inidividual differ- ences are preserved" b) "injurious variations are destroyed" c) "variations neither useful nor injurious are not affected." 2. The fittest survive. Obviously this is not a definition which describes and sets forth the properties of the elemental operation of natural selection. It is an introduction to a conception via its consequences. Each of these statements asserts a consequence of natural selection which, obviously, is something other than the process. The first alludes to a step in evolution. The second refers to rejection. The third sets forth circumstances by wvhich nothing happens and the fourth is survival. If it is assumed, as many do, that these statements represent the truth conditions significant to Darwin's conception of natural selection, certain problems are raised. The result of Darwin's detailing consequences of natural selection has led to ambiguous language that rarely follows such a method of presentation. This is because the more significant evolutionary consequences of natural selection, as expressed by both Darwin and by later evolutionists, entail a sorting of properties through variation in reproductive sequence, a sorting of genes in reproductive sequence, and a sorting of gene frequencies in successive states of populations. This abstracted evo- lutionary sorting is selection-like and operation-like; hence the term "selection" has been applied to it. It is not surprising that in the minds of many, therefore, the description of these abstract sortings is considered a description of the process of natural selection. The term "natural selection" not only came to symbolize these 3 abstract notions of selection, but, in order to account for survival, included the implied selection of individuals by their environments. When viewed in terms of sets of identical truth conditions, "natural selection" and "evolu- tion" thereby have become synonymous in usage. The distinction between the selective principle and its conse- quences has become lost. Furthermore, the inclusioni in a single concept of environmental selection and these selection-like abstractions from different levels of abstrac- tion violates the theory of types and is logically inadmis- sible. To state that natural selection so defined gives rise to evolution is to state tautologically that evolution follows from evolution. The conclusion merely reiterates the premise, and natural selection cannot serve the role envisaged for it by Darwin. Let us look further into what happens to our language when such abstract consequences are regarded as the source of meaning of "natural selection." When we em- ploy such words as "variation" and "difference" we are talking about a relation between unlike individuals. Em- phasis is placed upon such properties of organisms where- by individuals differ from one aniother. By focusing our attention on properties that vary, our language is led to circumvent individuals and properties that do not vary. These appear to be left hanging in a conceptual vacuum in the nebulous realm of the "not affected." Since selec- tion implies its complement "rejection" (or not selected), the implication is clear that these are rejected. Yet they suevive. When useful properties are considered as essen- tial to selection, implication indicates that because these surviving individuals were Inot selected their properties must be useless. Obviously no one means this. It is strictly a case of logical implication playing a trick on uis through our imperfect language. Still another difficulty arises because it is not wholly clear just what is being selected. Is it individuals with useful variations? Or is it "useful" varying properties taken out of a context of other "useless" and non-varying properties and intellectually isolated as a single obj ect of thought ? To speak thus on the level of properties demands abstraction by human observers. Such abstrac- tion obscures both the locus and the nature of the ele- mental selective operation. Is natural selection a relation between an individual organism and its environmental condition? Does it occur in meiosis? Is it an influence of genic materials on ontogeny to change properties? Is it a genetic operation in populations such that successions of gene frequency may be spoken of ? If it is an elemental operation, it must be one and only one such operation. Any combination must of necessity involve abstraction</page><page sequence="3">160 REPORTS Ecology, Vol. 42, No. 1 into an operation-like concept. If it is one and onily one elemental operation, it must be such conceptually that all others significant to evolutioni may be deduced from it in a manner consistent with the laws of the organization of knowledge and without violating the laws of nature. Thus we have been led, by the implications of our state- ments, into confusing the descriptioni of evolution witth its explanationl. It should be clear that Darwin's conception of natural selection involves the selective relation of an orgainism with its environment. In this respect Darwin was closer to the ecological implications of natural selection than most of his successors. However, by treating his subject from the point of view of the consequences of natural selectioni in the origin of species without clearly defining its operation, the way was left open to all of the confusing views that have entered subsequent conceptions of niatural selection. ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF NATURAI SELECTION OF THE POPULATION GENETICISTS The history of the theory of natural selection subse- quent to Darwin has been basically a continuation and amplification of similar ambiguities of language. Criti- cism was directed toward the role of the theory in evolu- tionI and its exemplification rather than toward the mean- ing of the concept. Therefore basic confusions have persisted. The strongest opposition to the theory came from the mutationists who were seeking in it evidence of the origin of variation. They pointed out that natural selection did not account for the origin of variation and therefore was inadequate to explain evolution. As a re- sult of the discovery by de Vries and Johannsen of variability produced from mutations, the theory of natural selection was temporarily replaced by the mutation theory. This conflict arose from a confusion between the opera- tion of natural selection with the origin of what is to he selected. It resulted in further confusing natural selection with evolution which is a sequence of selective operations involving change. With the advent of popula- tion genetics, it became clear that other cytogentic forces also produce change. These, together with mutation and other mutagenic forces, were incorporated into the neo- Darwinian theory of natural selection as its creative or diversifying element. It is significant to point out that incorporation of the origin of variations into the concept of natural selection was still clung to; the ways in which it was accomplished, however, were broadened. It is prob- able that this preoccupation with the origin of variation as an explanation of evolution has resulted in natural selec- tion being primarily the concern of the geneticist rather than the ecologist. Contributions of the population genieticists to the general subject of selection are so voluminous as to preclude re- view of the entire literature. Therefore, precise semantic analyses have been made of the conceptions of lnatural selection of only a few of the modern population geneti- cists and evolutionists (Morgan 1903, Fisher 1930, Haldane 1936, Dobzhansky 1941, Nash 1944, Lull 1947, Holmes 1948, Muller 1949, Jepsen 1949, Wright 1949, Stebbins 1950, Simpson 1953, Simpson, Pittendrigh, and Tiffany 1957, Lerner 1958, Sheppard 1958). In the in- terest of brevity and to avoid repetition, only a summary of the results of our analyses with pertinent examples is presented. Despite considerable confusing diversity in details of the conceptions of natural selection expressed by the modern geneticist and evolutionist, several basic and unifying ideas emerge from these analyses. First, these workers are concerned with various mechanisms whereby variation is produced. Second, they express the varia- tion of properties in terms of gene action. Third, tlhe assessment of gene variation is made within a population, thus leading to the prominence of such concepts as gene frequency. Fourth, to insure the continuation of evolu- tion, they demand reproductive continuity as a part of selection. Fifth, most of them indicate that useful varia- tions are cumulative through the action of natural selec- tiotn. Sixth, they consider rej ection as operationally significant to the concept "selection." The problem of the restriction of the concept of niatural selection to just those properties which vary has been discussed in connection with Darwin's conception of natural selection. It is understandable how, in their preoccupation with properties that vary, subsequent thinkers inadvertently abstracted these sequences of Xvariable properties from their operational context as a single object of thought. In this abstracted state the sequence of properties stood more clearly in their rela- tion to evolution. WVe must repeat that it is not sur- prising, therefore, that they should have regarded this abstracted sequenice aiid the cytogentic operations respon- sible for the sequence as the process of natural selection. It must be reemphasized that this abstraction by hIimanis is entirely apart from the empirical biological operation of selectioni. From this abstraction a concept emerges that is operation-li e. This has been confusecl with tie actual operation in which only those physiologically coll- stituted to function in the available environment are se- lected for survival from a given set of differing individual organisms. The results of any cytogenetic events that produce favorable variations are thereby in turn selected. The abstractions that go beyond this, to unify or to in- terpret and to explain the origin of variation in its rela- tion to evolution, involve classification. Although the iniclusion of the origin of variationi pre- vailed among most workers, Dobzhansky (1941), for example, realized the difficulties of its incorporation in the concept natural selection. He states, ". . . the origini of variation is a problem entirely separate fronm the action of selection. The theory of natural selectioni is concerned with the fate of variations already present . . ." Holmes (1948), however, questions the assumption that variaticn should be regarded as something giveni in nature upon whiclh natural selection acts. This seems to him to imply that variation itself is not a product of natural selection. The ambiguity is apparent in his discussions of gametes. He seems to regard these as involved in a continiuity of the selective process from gamete formation through the formation of the zygote. Actually, gamete formation is under the influence of a selective operation oni the parents. In addition, selection operates onl the gametes themselves during any independenit existence; the formiiationi of the zygote initiates a new selective re-ime. It has been pointed ouit that by including the description of evolutionI in the conception of natural selectioni, a con- fusion of levels of abstraction is generated. The neo- Darwiniians, not having analyzed the sources of ambigtuity in Darwin's language, were led into further levels of abstraction when they spoke of natural selection in terms of the sorting of genes through the reproductive sequence. For to discuss natural selection at the level of gene opera- tions in reproductive sequence is to add another level in ordler to account for the ontogenetic origin of properties. Although genes are themselves properties, because their role is to direct the organization of other prop erties in ontogeny, the level of organization in knowledge is dif- feretnt. Therefore, they, in their role in ontogeny, must be treated on a different logical level. It follows that the</page><page sequence="4">January, 1961 REPORTS 161 sorting of genes must be handled in our language as logically different from the sorting of their resulting properties. By regarding these sortings as the process of selection, this gives a third conception of the term "natural selection" as employed by the neo-Darwinians. The conceptions of natural selection now include: 1) se- lective relation between an organism and its environmental conditions, 2) selection of properties in reproductive sequence, and 3) the sorting of genes. The first is an empirical relation whereas the latter two each are ab- stracted from a different and separate set of facts taken from a succession of environmental selections. The emphasis on gene sorting requires the interbreeding population as the locus of operation. However, no ele- mental biological operation takes place above the level of an individual organism. An adjustment in understanding that yielded a feeling of comprehension was achieved by adopting the statistical concept of "gene frequencies." There is herein an assumption of an interpretation in terms of an elemental biological operation significant to natural selection. We have thus a fourtlh notion of se- lection at an even higher level of abstraction. This emphasis upon gene frequencies also has led to some mis- understanding regardinig the role of the concept popula- tion. "Population" has been reified to the extent that some workers discuss selection as involving the "physi- ology of the population not of individuals" (Stebbins 1950). It should be emphasized that as instruments of know ledge, gene frequencies and other population plhe- nomena result from classification of empirical knowledge pertaining to individuals. Many workers have stated that the purpose of survival is reproduction. This point is well exemplified in the definition of natural selection presented by Simpson, Pittendrigh, and Tiffany (1957). They state, "The proc- ess of natural selection, which is the sum total of life's hazards, selects on the basis of competence to live, or rather competence to reproduce." They compare natural selection to a game wherein the obj ective of each indi- vidual is reproduction. Through the reproductive se- quenice an evolutionary advantage is accumulated by the more fecund, and success becomes a matter of chance favored by large numbers. Whereas they speak of se- lection resting in a "competence to live," their qualifying phrase indicates that this is of little consequence against the statistical chances of survival arising out of fecundity. What is accomplished by conceptions such as those of Simpson, Pittendrigh, and Tiffany is the notion of repro- ductive continuity necessary as a context for evolution. They are discussing evolution and not natural selection. An individual that fails to reproduce is as effectively selected as one that does reproduce. What the former fails to accomplish is an effective role in any further evo- lution of the population. Darwin's notion that useful variationis are selected and harmful variations are rejected has lead directly to the modern evolutionist's conceptions of adaptations and the accumulation of adaptations as an evolutionary conse- quen:e of such selections. This idea has been so si nifi- cant that a large terminology, such as "adaptive response, "adaptive radiation," etc. has developed to express its various features. Significant ambiguity results from two very different conceptions of adaptation. One conception is contained within the other. The range of physiological capacity of the organism, or any of the elements of this range, may be spoken of as an inherited adaptation. Some distinguish this as "preadaptation." Within this range of preadapta- tions some individuals effectively adjust and are said ta be currently "able to adapt themselves to different eni- vironmental conditions." The one is an inherited natural state for each particular organism; the other is an opera- tion or physiological adjustment by the organisms within the limits of their inherited physiological capacity. It fol- lows that the word "adaptation" is apt to mean signifi- cantly different things to different people. This may account for the differences in the manner in which the terms "variation" per se and "adaptation" are handled in the literature. Dobzhansky (1941) maintains, and we think correctly, that adaptation is the concern of natural selection whereas variation is the concern of evolution. However, when we shift to a context of reproductive con- tinuity and discuss the cumulative nature of adaptiveness ("adaptations" in the current literature) we are discussing variation in adaptiveness in reproductive sequence. Our subject then shifts from natural selection to evolution. Thus the class of things that varies comprises two sub- classes, namely, those that vary adaptively, and those that vary otherwise. To discuss variation in reproductive sequence, regardless of which subclass is our subject, is to discuss evolution. Finally, most modern population geneticists and evolu- tionists discuss rejection as though it played a continuing active role in the selective operation. They discuss a population whose members operate strictly within the genetic influence of what is there and the evolutionary consequences of this. Their language implies that those organisms rejected, and hence not there, somehow con- tinue to influence the result by not entering into it. Im- plications of this problem will be discussed later. How- ever Simpson, Pittendrigh, and Tiffany (1957) provide a slightly different approach in the definition quoted above. Here it appears that "life's hazards" are the selectilng agents rather than favorable media of the environmenit that permit survival. This anthropomorphic notion of the "struggle for existence" apparently has so thoroughly permeated the language of natural selection that it is often assumed to be a part of it. It is a formal analogy that belongs to the explanation of the role of natural selection in evolution rather than to an understanding of the process of natural selection. In summary it appears that in the current conceptions of natural selection there is confusion of the elenmental biological operation with the evolutionary sequences that are explained by means of natural selection. This expla- nation seems to demand a level of abstraction in which the sequential change from generation to generation call be isolated as single objects of thought. Such an intel- lectual operation is valuable, but sometimes the patterns of property sorting, of gene sorting, of gene frequencies and their consequences observed through generations are mistaken for the elemental biological process of natural selection. Natural selection cannot be described as an elemental biological operation at the abstract level of evolution. It occLirs at a level of separate and discrete acts which together in ordered sequence constitute a group whose properties may be abstracted to the evolu- tionary level. The result of confusion in these matters is that we think we are discussing liatural selection when truth conditicns that give meaning to our statements in- dicate that we are actually discussing evolution. ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT NATURAI SELECTION With the previously discussed coinfusions in mind we may now seek to establish the truth conditions upon which a rigorous concept of natural selection may rest. The following statement seems to us to clarify the problem. "X" is the process natural selection is true if and only if:</page><page sequence="5">162 REPORTS Ecology, Vol. 42, No. 1 1. It comprises elemental operational relations between an individual organism and its environmental conditions such that the organism satisfies all of its physical needs for establishment and survival. 2. It endures through the ontogeny of all stages of the life cycle to successor organisms in reproductive se- quence, if there are any. The first statement is necessary because it accounts for the physical basis for survival in terms of the operations of the organism as conditioned by environmental condi- tions. It is insufficient only if it is successfully argued that the term "organism" does not imply its ontogeny and the separate and independent stages of the life cycle. In that event the second statement is necessary especially to include any independent environmental relations in the alternation of generations as well as those of gametes, spores, and seeds, etc. Although successor organisms are essential to evolution, it is important to note they are not essential to the process of selection of any predeces- sor generation. To demonstrate the sufficiency of these two statements, we will attempt to show that all of the facts necessary to an understanding of the role of natural selection in biology are either asserted or implied. The sufficiency resulting from implication stems from the fact that the operatiolal relations of the organism to its environment are physio- logical. An understanding of this makes clear that there are inherited limitations in tolerance which are meaning- ful in terms of definite ranges of environmental condi- tions. There is thus implicit in our definition the idea that the organism arrives in the habitat already endowed through prior genetic activity with its physiological ca- pacity as a prior adaptation. This is a fact in the history of the conditioning of the organism and, although perti- nent to the origin and selection of this organism, it is not a part of the selective act upon this organism. The fur- ther operations of meiosis and mitosis and any attendant mutagenic events within the selected organism do occur under the influence of this act of selection. They in turn are part of the history of the next discrete and inde- pendent descendant unit of selective operations. It is also essential to understand that natural selection permits each like as well as unlike organism to live and carry on all of its vital processes. Therefore every onto- genetic event of physiology and morphology that is in relation to environmental conditions is a part of the se- lective operation. This includes any independent stages of the life cycle necessary to the generation of the next selective step. Natural selection is not restricted to just those processes that may introduce change into a popula- tion. Hence, organisms reproducing asexually and those that may not reproduce at all are not precluded. "Rejection," which Darwin made a part of his state- ment and subsequently has been considered necessary to natural selection need not be included in our definition. This concept provides subtle semantic and logical prob- lems which require careful and detailed attention to clarify. All propagules presented to their environment together comprise a class. Selection provides the basis for a subclass of selected organisms and its complement, which is the subclass of rejected organisms. The class selected organisms implies that others have been rejected, but it must not be supposed that selection and rejection are thereby either the same or a similar operation. The term "natural selection" is concerned only with the selective operation and the selected organisms. The circumstances of the selection of an organism are the sources of the truth conditions which will confirm natural selection. From knowledge of fecundity of organisms and of the number of propagules produced, compared with the num- ber of survivors, an inexact comprehension is gained of the rejected. Whereas it is known that there are rejected organisms, except in experiments it is often di -cult to point them out to confirm our statements. The subject of rejection in its formal nature is much like the subject of isolation in the literature of genetics. On an operational level the population that survives or that which is isolated, is permitted to operate strictly within the genetic influence of what is selected or what is isolated. The individuals of these selected and isolated populations provide the only material for operations sig- nificant to our subjects. This says nothing about rejec- tion or the rejected organisms themselves or about those isolated against. In both subjects there is an inherent human tendency to discuss the negative aspects, as thougoh the individuals rejected or those isolated against con- tinued to influence actively the result by not being there. However, the notion of rejection can be abstracted fromn its context of noninfluence and be employed to amplify the explanation of the restrictive nature of the influences present and to explain the sorting accomplished. The role of rejection in discourse is thus explanation of the completed and classified results of natural selection rather than description of its continuing operation. Rejectioni in each individual case eliminates the individual from any operation of natural selection in that case. Our subject must be discussed with the awareness of the distinction between natural selection as an elemental biological opera- tion and the abstractions, explanations, and inferences from a sequence of selections that humans build into evolutionary ideas. It is only in these explanations that the role of rejection, in an abstract sense, can take form in a positive statement bearing on ev7olution. To some the absence of a statement involving indirect influences on selection may cause concern. Such proper- ties of organisms as protective coloration and other pro- tective structures do influence natural selection by inhibit- ing rejection. This inhibition of rejection may occur at any stage in the life cycle. Actually these indirect in- fluences are implied in the first statement because when effective, the organism is permitted to continue to satisfy its physical needs for survival. The above analysis sets forth only the strictly biologi- cally operational relations between the individual organ- ism and its environmental conditions. In setting forth the unity of each operation cognizance is not taken of any other organism, whether like or unlike. The selective operation on each organism is thus construed as a logi- cally self-contained set of facts. When an understanding of the results of natural selection is sought, we move from the data presented by any given case to that of many given cases, both as of any given time and through any sequence of generations through time. Our problems then shift from perception of facts to classification of our conceptual knowledge and the inferences and deductions that may be derived therefrom. Figure 1 graphically presents examples of the organiza- tion of knowledge about natural selection. In the left hand column are indicated the empirical sources of knowl- edge, namely, each individual organism separately and independently in selective relation with the elements of its environment. It should be reemphasized that it is in this empirical relation of each organism. to its environ- ineuttal conditions that all of the facts pertinent to natural selection take place. All else that has been traditionally associated with this term results from classification and deduction.

These classes are established either consciously or intuitively. If a class at a given level rests upon properties of organisms, there is denoted by the class concept thus established a class of organisms possessing these properties. It is assumed that the prop- erties, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, therefore imply the class. As the empirical data of many selective operations are classified, two major classes develop as viewed in terms of, 1) a set of contemporary organisms (contemporary selections), and 2) a set of organisms in reproductive sequence (sequential selection). Each of these classes of knowledge may, be subdivided according to whether it concerns, 1) ally given species population, or 2) the total population of diverse kinds of organisms. These two subclasses may each be viewed in terms of differences or similarities observed between members. In some in- stances further classification may be of value. For ex- ample, in the case of contemporary members' of a given species population, we might be interested independently in the differences in the properties contingent in the organism and the difference in their habitat relation. Through classification there is segregated related knowl- edge about these aggregates or classes or organisms. For example, in the class of contemporary selections of any given species population, there are the facts that permit us to assess differences and similarities of the members. From this observation we may deduce a concept of varia- tioIn withini the species population. By manipulating p)rof erties of members of the class, gene frequency. may be measured and the genetic structure of the population determined. The selection of each member by its environ- ment permits us to classify the pertinent facts and relate them to genetic interpretation. However, our case must not be stated in language that appears to raise the selec- tive operation to the abstract class level we have generated and where the results of our comparisons are abstractly unified into concepts. It cannot be over emphasized that it is not the class that was selected, for the class was generated in a classifier's mind. Nor was it the concept that was selected. Only the members of the class could possibly be selected, and these separately and independ- ently. Through them properties are selected. When the data are considered from the point of view of differences in the relation of members of species popu- lations to environment, we gain a sense of patterning of the population over its habitat mosaic. On the other hand, when the 'similarities of the members of a species population are considered, the class concepts of the taxo- nomic class at species or subspecies levels become evi- dent. Considered in terms of like environmental rela- tions, a sense of ecotypic unity of the class may develop. Also from the point of view of the total unlike popula- tion, data may be assessed in terms of differences and similarities of the members. The differences lead to facts of floristics and faunistics, vegetation, and community structure. The similarities provide us with the class concepts of floras, faunas, vegetation, and communities. It is the sequential classes that lead to the ideas of popu'lation continuity and their attendant organism dy- namics. From the point of view of any given species population, where we are concerned with differences ob- served, the facts lead to concepts of evolution and phy-</page><page sequence="7">164 REPORTS Ecology, Vol. 42, No. 1 logenetic change and the role of selection in these changes. Through similarities of constituents such se- quences prompt ideas of continuity of taxonomic classes at the species or subspecies level. These sequences, treated from the point of view of the total population, lead to some of the familiar concepts of ecology. As differences between the members of the sequence are assessed, we are led to ideas of floristic, faunistic, and vegetational change, including succession. On the other hand, as the similarities in the sequence are assessed we gain ideas regarding the continuity of com- munity patterns. The classes represented in Figure 1 by no means ex- haust possible classification ot facts derivable from the totality of selections nor are the subjects listed here com- plete. They are only intended to suggest the kinds of facts available and how they may be isolated and aggre- gated as objects of inquiry. The main point is that classi- fication is a natural and very important tool of the human mind in organizing data for explanation. Thus the sub- ject matter generally discussed as "natural selection" is here presented in the classes of contemporary and sequen- tial selections as they relate to differences within species populations. Biologists have intuitively and even perhaps unwittingly classified and brought the resulting abstrac- tions to unity. They then have interpreted the classes as though they constituted the empirical data discovered in nature. Following this limited usage there has been a tendency for biologists generally to think of natural selection as a concept more or less restricted to the abstractions of genetics and evolutionary study. It should be apparent to the ecologist, however, that in the various classes segregated are data significant also to his inter- pretations. In fact, the definition of natural selection as a biological operation permits establishment of the concept as one of the basic propositions for all of biology. Thus perhaps the theory aids as a unifying concept, as well as providing a better perspective for the interrela- tionships of scientific knowledge with which the biologist works. It is of great importance for the ecologist to integrate properly the role of these organized bodies of knowledge. The interpretation of ecological problems at different levels of abstraction may become clearer if thinking is conditioned by the fact that each and every individual organism is a product of the process of natural selection and all that it imHplies. Some of the reviewers of our manuscript have sug- gested that the evolutionist be allowed to retain his usage of the term "natural selection" for selection-like abstrac- tions because he has employed it in this manner for such a long time. To this we object. In his usage "natural selection" is synonymous with evolution and he can only generate a tautology by employing it in the sense of an operation leading to evolution. He says in effect, "Evo- lution is a product of evolution." The term "natural selection" would be wasted thereby. There is a significant use of the term in precisely the sense that Darwin in- tended it, and it is this historic use of the term that we advocate. SUMMARY Natural selection, being a relation between an organism and its environmental conditions, is an ecological concept. Many ecologists, however, may not have seen the direct role of this concept in their problems because Darwin presented the theory in a context of evolutionary explana- tion of the origin of species. Subsequent usage has further engulfed the concept with explanations of evolution and cytogenetic operations such that the ecological operations have been obscured. This confusion is primarily a prod- uct of language and the organization of knowledge. Therefore, language analysis, with its goal of establishing necessary and sufficient truth conditions upon which the concept rests, offers possible clarification of the problem. Semantic analyses of the various conceptions of natural selection display the problems of ambiguities of language. Darwin's conception stemmed from perceptions of dif- ferent properties and the assessment of their variation and the selective role of the environment in determining which of differing individuals would survive. He ab- stracted from the natural phenomena only those changed and useful properties which were meaningful to his motive of explaining the origin of species. This led to ambiguity as to whether properties or individuals were being selected and as to the precise locus of the operation. LLcewise it resulted in building selection and evolution into a single idea that combined the empirical relations of the inli- vidual organism and its environmental conditions with the abstractions of continuity in the variations of suc- cessions of organisms. Subsequent history of the theory has been a continua- tion and amplification of such ambiguities in laniguage. The population geneticist and evolutionist have added a further level of abstraction by incorporating gene sorting into the concept as an explanation of variations in prop- erties of the language of Darwin. Reproductive conti- nuity is also demanded to insure evolution. Thus, they too have explained evolution rather than described the selective operation at the empirical level. Semantic analysis establishes the following necessary and sufficient truth conditions for the concept of natural selection: 1) It comprises elemental operational (physiological) relations between an individual organism and its environ- mental conditions such that the organism satisfies all of its physical needs for establishment and survival. 2) It endures through the ontogeny of all stages of the life cycle to successor organisms in reproductive se- quence, if there are any. When an uniderstanding is sought for the results of natural selection, as an elemental biological operation, we move from data presented by a single case to that of many like and diverse cases. Our problems shift from perception primarily to classification of conceptual knowl- edge and the inferences and deductions to be derived therefrom. As the empirical data of many selections are classified, two major classes develop as viewed in terms of a set of contemporary organisms and a set of organisms in reproductive sequence. These classes may be further subdivided in terms of any species population and total population and then by differences and similarities. Thus the data are segregated into classes significant to the role of natural selection in the various disciplines of biology, and thus include the subject matter traditionally discussed as natural selection. Such a conception provides the ecologist with a perspective of the interrelationships of bodies of knowledge which he must synthesize. The interpretation of ecological problems at different levels of abstraction may become clearer if thinking is condi- tioned by knowledge that each and every individual is a product of natural selection.
