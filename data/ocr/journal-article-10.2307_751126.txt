<plain_text><page sequence="1">SLA UGHTERED OX REMBRANDT AND THE SLA UGHTERED OX R EMBRANDT did not very often make still life the primary subject of his pictures. Only a handful of his works can be classified as nature morte. But among these few, two are paintings of The Slaughtered Ox. The earlier is in the Glasgow Art Gallery (P1. 38a).1 It is usually dated to the late 163os. The second version, inscribed with the date 1655, is in the Louvre (P1. 38c).2 The two pictures are very similar in composi- tion and mood. Rembrandt shows the darkened interior of a room in which a slaughtered ox hangs lashed to a cross beam by the hind legs. In the Glasgow panel the head and hide of the ox are shown piled on the floor at the lower right. A woman appears in both works. In the Glasgow painting she seems to be mopping the floor, while in the Louvre picture she stands in a door at the foot of a stairway and thoughtfully peers around either towards the carcass or towards the viewer. The literature on Rembrandt's Slaughtered Ox is not extensive. For the most part, discussions centre around the loose impressionistic style of the Louvre version or the dating problems of the Glasgow panel. Some time ago, however, J. A. Emmens suggested that the paintings should be considered from an iconographic viewpoint.3 In 1969 Joseph Miiller ventured that the hanging carcass of Rembrandt's Slaughtered Ox might represent the idea of death;4 and E. de Jongh has connected the pictures with the general theme of memento mori in Dutch art.s Little else about the meaning of the pictures has been said in print, although almost everyone has suspec- ted that there is more to The Slaughtered Ox than meets the eye.6 The image of the slaughtered ox forms a long and clearly definable tradition which at its inception is closely tied to the parable of the Prodigal Son.' One early print after Martin van Heemskerck is devoted to the happiest episode of that well-known story (Pl. 39c). The Prodigal Son has given up his wastrel life and has returned to his home and to his father (Luke 15. 11-32). So overjoyed is the father that he orders a great celebration with the killing of the fatted calf to provide a feast. Heemskerck shows the slaughter of the animal in the left foreground while the Prodigal Son dances happily with his friends in the right background, as an inscription beneath the print makes clear.9 The prominence of the ox and the 1 Br. 458.

Discussing the sombre mood of the Louvre Ox he notes, 'The flayed ox has become a tragic - one might almost say a religious picture'. (An Introduction to Rembrandt, New York 1978, p. 114). This has previously been noted also by C. Campbell, 'Rembrandt's "Polish Rider" and the Prodigal Son', this Journal, xxxIII, 1970, p. 296, n. i8. 8 The print is one of a set of six engravings dated 1562 that tell the story of the Prodigal Son. This is no. 5 of the set, signed by Heemskerck as designer, Philipp Galle as engraver, and Theodor Galle as publisher. See F. W. H. Hollstein, Dutch and Flemish Etchings, Engravings and Woodcuts, ca. 145-I7o00, vII, p. 244, no. 286. 9 The inscription reads, 'Pater ilium novis vestimentis induit, vitulum mactat, et simul letati sunt'. ('The father puts a new robe on him, kills the calf, and at once they are happy.') The choice of the word 'macto' implies that the calf is a sacrifice, and not just food for the table.

The celebrants are given a much less dominant visual role than the 'genre' activities of the slaughter. Yet the extensive exegesis of the story of the Prodigal Son suggests that the slaughter of the ox is very important. Since Tertullian the parable has been explained as an allegory of God's forgiveness of sinners, with the Prodigal Son said to represent either the Gentiles or backsliding Christians.1o In this scheme, the killing of the fatted calf at the joyous return of the Son is the symbolic equivalent of the sacrifice of Christ on the cross. Sermon after sermon as well as innumerable commentaries on Luke I5 make this point: the ox stands for Christ." St Jerome said flatly, 'The fatted calf, which is sacrificed for the safety of penitents, is the Saviour Himself, on whose flesh we feed, whose blood we drink daily'.12 The appropri- ateness of such a simile must certainly have been strengthened forJerome and others by the authority of the Old Testament prescription from Leviticus that commands the Israelites to sacrifice a bullock specifically as a sin offering (Leviticus 4. 1-12). The comparison of the ox with the crucified Christ is occasionally made in very direct visual terms, for example in the Bible moralise'e of the thirteenth century preserved in London (P1. 39b).13 In the roundel illustrating the killing of the calf, the animal appears twice, once on the floor where it is ritually slaughtered and again 'elevated' on a cross beam as a butcher opens the abdominal cavity with a knife. Below, a second roundel shows Christ on the cross with the centurion piercing His side with a lance. The visual comparison is made explicit by the Latin text in the margin: the killing of the fatted calf signifies the death of God's own son for the redemption of mankind.14 Heemskerck's print (P1. 39c), then, is not a secularization of a religious story, but shows the reason why the Prodigal Son may rejoice with his friends, for he has been saved from sin by a sacrifice. By the middle of the sixteenth century the image of the hanging ox not only appeared in representations of the Prodigal Son, but it began to find its way into other moralizing pictures closely related in theme. One of these is Martin van Cleve's so-called Cavalier in a Peasant Household (P1. 4ob),15 a large panel showing a well-dressed gentleman carousing among peasants. He may be the Prodigal Son himself. He is certainly a prodigal character. Peasants toast and eat greedily at the table, and musicians play as they so often do in scenes of the Prodigal Son's dissipation.16 In other parts of the picture children are shown being raised in the gluttonous ways of their parents. In the left foreground a child drinks hungrily from a bowl, and at the right several other children share their dish with a cat. The inevitable result of all this gorging is shown in the right foreground where a child with a mischievous smile is helped to its toilet under the leering gaze of a pig.7 But 10 In these cases the complaining elder brother of the story often stands for the Jews. See Tertullian, 'Liber de Pudicitia', inJ. P. Migne, Patrologiae cursus completus ... series prima (Latina), 11, 994-95 (hereafter PL). 11 A partial list of only the more important writers who have made the comparison of the ox to Christ includes: St Ambrose, Commentary on Luke (bk vi), PL, xv, 1761; St Jerome, letter 21 ('To Damasus'), PL, xxI, 388; Venerable Bede, Commentary on Luke (bk Iv), PL, xcII, 525; Haymo of Halbertstadt, Homily 41, PL, cxvIII, 250; Peter Chrysologus, Sermon on the Prodigal Son no. 5, PL, LII, 200; and many others. 12 'Vitulus saginatus qui ad poenitentis immolatur salutem, ipse Salvator est, cujus quotidie carne pascimur, cruore potamur.'

In addition to the Cavalier's own erotic conduct, in the background near the fire a man fondles the breast of a woman who dries diapers over the coals. The theme of human lust and gluttony is summed up in the foreground in the image of a copulating hen and rooster and a pig gorging itself on a pile of turnips and carrots. In the right corner of the room a mother and her naked babe are presented with bread and wine. They remind one immediately of the Madonna and Child, and bring the viewer finally to the image of the 'crucified' carcass of the ox looming behind them. It is partly masked by a small divider and no one pays it any attention. On one level the carcass seems perfectly appropriate as an animal slaughtered to become part of the gluttonous feast. But the close relationship of this picture with the imagery of the Prodigal Son would surely have called to mind for some viewers, at least, symbolic associations for the slaughtered ox. In the disguise of an animal sacrificed for the sustenance of the body, it might seem to hang, like Christ on the cross, as a reminder of His sacrifice which is the sustenance of the soul. Since the slaughtered ox appears here in the context of a sinful revel instead of the final homecoming of the Prodigal son, it seems to take on an ironic tone, a memento mori quality, as the revellers continue to disport themselves in the shadow of the very symbol of salvation.19 In a second painting by van Cleve the slaughtered ox completely dominates the com- position (P1. 38d).20 It too hangs by its hind legs from a crossbeam and its severed head stares out from a tub at the lower left. A basin catches the dripping blood and a little dog looks up warily. The human activity is significant - a butcher drains his draught of wine or ale (he is the 'kannekijker' or glutton) and children in the doorway blow up a bladder, a probable reference to the vanitas theme of homo bulla.21 Van Cleve's more famous contemporary, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, used a slaughtered ox in a similar way in his engraving of Prudence (P1. 4Ib).22 It is one of the series of the Seven Virtues which Charles de Tolnay long ago described as intentionally ironic ('topsy-turvy') because of its interpretation of the virtues from a materialistic and secular point of view, with the theological significance conspicuously absent. At the bottom of Prudence a Latin inscription warns: 'If you wish to be prudent, consider the future and keep in mind all things which can occur.'23 Around the allegorical figure of Prudence many of the activities involve storing up food and riches, carried out here with single-minded intensity. Some women are salting away meat in barrels while men carry heavy sacks of produce. Elsewhere men store up firewood, and still another deposits money in a large chest. In the lower right corner a bowl of porridge with a spoon stuck into it seems to be an emblem of physical satiety ('I have plenty'). While this may appear very prudent and foresighted activity, the actions are concerned 18 Lust and gluttony are the two deadly sins most commonly associated with the Prodigal Son story in exegetical writings and in the popular Prodigal Son plays of the sixteenth century. See Willem de Volder's (Gnapheus's) Acolastus, translated into Latin, French and English, and reprinted no less than 47 times between 1529 and 1587, for an account of the kinds of sins of which the Prodigal Son was thought guilty by the sixteenth century. There is a widely available English version edited by P. L. Carver, The Comedy of Acolastus, Early English Text Series 202, London 1937. 19 A similar carousing scene with a slaughtered ox appears in the background of Pieter Aertsen's The Meat Stall in Uppsala University. Charles Cuttler has already called this little vignette in Aertsen a kind of Crucifixion scene (Northern Painting from Pucelle to Bruegel, New York 1968, P. 459). For a discussion of the complex imagery of Aertsen's painting see Kenneth M. Craig, 'Pieter Aertsen and The Meat Stall', Oud Holland, 96, 1982, pp. 1-5. 20 Panel, monogrammed and dated I566. The ox is identical in nearly every detail to the one in the background of Pl. 4ob. This painting closely resembles Rembrandt's later versions of the subject in general presentation and in some specific details. It is especially close to the Glasgow painting in the elaborate coiling of the rope ends and in the curling of the tail of the ox above the beam. The position and the action of the woman at the side of the ox is similar in both pictures as well. 21 That the bladder may serve as the equivalent of the water bubble in this context is reasonable enough. The word for 'bladder' and 'bubble' is the same in Dutch, 'blaas'. See also E. de Jongh, Rembrandt en zijn tijd, n. 5 above, p. 169. 22 The engraving is signed by Bruegel as 'inventor' and Hieronymus Cock as publisher. The preparatory drawing, preserved in Brussels, Musees Royaux des Beaux-Arts, is signed and dated 1559. For discussion of the series of the Virtues and Vices see Charles de Tolnay, Die Zeichnungen Pieter Bruegels, Munich 1925; Pierre Bruegel l'Ancien, Brussels 1935 (esp. pp. 2-22); The Drawings ofPieter Bruegel the Elder, New York 1952. For another interpretation of the prints see Walter Gibson, Bruegel, New York 1977, pp. 58-64. Professor Gibson correctly points out that Bruegel fre- quently employs traditional imagery in his representations of the Virtues. The question is whether he maintains a traditional attitude toward those images. 23 The Latin reads, 'Si prudens esse cupis, in futurum prospectum ostende, et quae possunt contingere, animo tuo cuncta propone'.</page><page sequence="4">238 NOTES AND DOCUMENTS only with the temporal needs of men and hardly exemplify the biblical ideal of spiritual pru- dence. (See for example Luke 12. 16-23 with Christ's parable about a rich man who stored up food and drink.) Significantly, all the worldly activity in Bruegel's print is bracketed at each side by an image of death. At the left is a man on his deathbed. He is attended by a doctor who is examining a urine specimen, but also by a tonsured priest to whom he now turns. A small crucifixion picture hangs on the wall behind the bed.24 Here at last is a man who does not neglect his spiritual future. On the opposite side of the composition a slaughtered ox hangs in a darkened niche. Of course, the image is well enough suited to the context of the provisioning and hoarding that constitute the major actions depicted in the print. But it is easily read symbolically. The ox itself is a powerfully physical reminder of death, carefully balancing the image of the dying man. A figure standing beside the ox draws attention to it with the light of his burning candle that may be the 'brief candle' of the vita brevis. Finally, amidst a scene of prodigal concern for worldly goods, the hanging ox would have recalled for many in Bruegel's audience the story of the Prodigal Son, and by extension the hanging Christ. The slaughtered ox becomes a two-edged symbol, a reminder of death that carries within itself a reminder of the path to salvation. Both vignettes - dying man and slaughtered ox - foreshadow a spiritual future, preparations for which only spiritual prudence will do. The slaughtered ox with symbolic connotations can be found in moralizing genre pictures of the seventeenth century as well. Pictures by Abra- ham van den Hecke and David Teniers (Pls 39a, 4oa) make spectacular use of the dramatic possibilities of the hanging carcass.25 But beyond their sheer pictorial boldness, these paintings also make reference to gluttony and to the vanitas theme of homo bulla just like their sixteenth-century predecessors. They are, in effect, memento mori. 6 Yet the question remains whether Rembrandt's versions of The Slaughtered Ox, the most remarkable of all the paintings of this subject, should be interpreted in a similar symbolic way. In both the Glasgow and the Louvre pictures, the very presentation of the ox provokes a kind of religious contemplation.27 The butchered animal hangs in Rembrandt's mysterious raking light with all visual distrac- tions at a minimum. The simplicity of the composition and the quiet mood combine to create a powerful still-life image that is isolated and psychologically charged.2 The ox seems wonderful and pitiful at the same time. Was Rembrandt aware of that old tradition from the story of the Prodigal Son that saw the ox as a beast of sacrifice and a symbol of Christ crucified? There is evidence to suggest he was. Certainly no one knew the story of the Prodigal Son better nor felt it more deeply than he. Moreover, it is all but certain that he owned the little Heemskerck print which shows the ritual and symbolic sacrifice of the ox (P1. 39c).29 In addition, a small brush drawing from 1655, the year of the Louvre painting of The Slaughtered Ox, seems to connect Rembrandt with the moralizing tradition of the image (P1. 41a).30 It shows several figures grouped around and working on the hanging carcass of the slaughtered ox in a small building. Clark has described these figures as ghoulish, and so 24 The image of a man on his deathbed faced with a choice between worldly or spiritual concerns is closely related in theme and in form to the illustrations for the Ars Moriendi. 25 van den Hecke, The Flayed Ox, canvas, I 14 x 98 cm, Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum, inv. no.

Many of the meat pictures of the seventeenth century represent slaughtered pigs, not slaughtered oxen. The pig imagery seems to derive from emblem literature where it can symbolize the most pernicious sinners. For a list that includes pictures of both kinds of animals see J. Foucart et al., Le siecle de Rembrandt, tableaux hollandais des collections publiques francaises, Paris, Petit Palais 1970, no. 179. 27 See Clark's comments (n. 6 above) as well as A. M. Hind's formal comparison between The Slaughtered Ox and The Descent from the Cross (Br. 584) in Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art (Rembrandt, Oxford 1938, pp. 121-22). Rembrandt's tendency to condense religious narrative and to isolate its elements for the purpose of presenting a psychologically heightened picture has been discussed by C. Tiimpel, 'Studien zur Ikonographie der Historien Rembrandts, Deutung und Interpretation der Bildinhalte', Nederlands Kunsthistorischejaarboek, xx, 1969, esp. p. I6o. 29 The 1656 inventory of Rembrandt's possessions lists a book of Heemskerck's prints that claimed to contain all the works of that artist.

The eerie and mysterious quality of the light (like a night crucifixion) is most striking, radiating apparently from an artificial source held by one of the figures. The animal itself is manifestly anthropomorphic, reinforcing - for the draw- ing at least - the association of the hanging ox with the hanging Christ. There is one further clue to the content of the paintings themselves that ought not to be overlooked. A small graffito on the back wall in the Glasgow picture is a rough little drawing barely two-and-a-half centimetres high (P1. 38b). Making allowances for its small scale and its intentionally crude execution, it seems to show a man urinating at a crescent moon. It recalls the old Dutch proverb, often illustrated by Bruegel, that so colourfully describes the actions of futile men who always overreach themselves: 'Whatever I do, nothing succeeds, I always piss at the moon.'32 It is as if Rembrandt has condensed the moralizing genre figures of Teniers and van den Hecke, the prodigious hoarders of Bruegel, the drinkers and gluttons in van Cleve, and even the Prodigal Son himself, into this one sign which he stamps on the wall to mark a wastrel and futile world where men try to do the impossible - secure their own future - and where the ox hangs as a kind of warning of death and a promise of salvation wrapped up in one. As is so often the case with Rembrandt's pictures, there is a very great temptation to relate the two paintings of The Slaughtered Ox to events in the artist's life. The Glasgow panel was painted some time during those difficult years around I640 when several of the artist's infant children, his mother and his wife, died in quick succession. The Louvre panel was painted in the dark days of financial collapse and professional near-ruin. But in truth, we know absolutely nothing about the circum- stances surrounding the execution of these works. Only the mention of'a small ox from life by Rembrandt'33 in the 1656 inventory of his goods might indicate that one of the pictures, at least, remained in his possession and so may have had some personal significance for a man who was only too aware of his own human weaknesses. Such associations are tantalizingly elusive. More certain is that Rembrandt's Ox is a visual distillation of symbolic meanings and moralis- tic lessons that have accrued to the image in over a century of representation. Like the memento mori, The Slaughtered Ox provokes contemplation. The viewer is quietly but firmly reminded of sin and death, but also of the forgiveness of God. Along with all the other associations which The Slaughtered Ox may have, for Rembrandt the Ox also embodies his understanding of the relationship between God and Man. KENNETH M.
