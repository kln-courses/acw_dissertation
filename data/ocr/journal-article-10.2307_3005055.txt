<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of Social Forces 617 THE CONCEPT OF PROGRESS: III. THE METAPHYSICAL PHASE L. L. Bernard The metaphysical viewpoint had begun to replace the theological method of ex? planation of natural phenomena long be? fore the days of the great Greek metaphysicians, Socrates and Plato. To the Greek physical phi- losophers of the fifth and sixth centuries B. C. the gods already appeared to be myths, just as they had appeared to the bards of the Homeric age as traditions. They still served very well to point a moral or to give piquancy to a fable meant to illustrate a moral truth or some social duty or relationship; but when it came to the discussion of the visible or physical world of things, to see it directly rather than analogically, another termi- nology was manifestly necessary. It was in the seventh century B. C. that the philosophers of Miletis began to adopt a mechanistic explanation of phenomena in terms of what they considered the elements, earth, fire, air, and water. But, having no general laws or principles to serve as scientific explanation categories of the relation? ships of these elements and of their transforma- tion, and having rejected the theological or per? sonality explanation in so far as it applied to the physical as distinguished from the moral world, some of the more mystical among them invented the concept of nous. This nous was the principle of balance in the universe, the cosmic relationship which pervaded all things and bound them to? gether into a single world. In its more concrete aspect it was the firmament of the earlier thinkers and in the more abstract physical conception, it became space. But on the mental and moral side it was the correlate of the gods, of the personality directive force in the universe. From the concept of a uni? versal firmament or a connecting and all-bathing tenuum of space, as the handiwork of a person? ality behind or in the background, the mind of the philosopher advanced to the concept of a non- personal spiritual force in the universe. This was his substitution for a personal god or galaxy of gods and spirits. Sometimes the old Greek phi? losophers called this depersonalized god of theirs, "love," at other times, "justice." It was for them a sort of force or power which made for balance and harmony. It was their substitute for order in the world which formerly had been provided by the concept of the watchful and directing gods. But it had an advantage as a maker and a pre- server of order or of law in the universe, for it lacked the whimsicality of the anthropomorphic personality of the gods. It constituted a step forward towards the impersonal physical concept of scientific law. Thus, as thinking men became better acquainted with their universe through astronomical observa? tions and geographical discoveries and the de- scriptions of travelers and returned soldiers, the gods disappeared more and more into the back? ground. The universal nous was extended to the human and psychic realms to explain those moral and social adjustments which had formerly been supposed to be the handiwork of the gods. Thus, in the systems of the Sophists, nous was supposed to extend its principle of balance or harmony into the human mind as reason, and into the social organization as law. In this way the meta- physical, as distinguished from the theological, explanation took possession of the fields of social and phychic phenomena, and the gods were driven out of the universe of the social and moral phi- losophers as formerly they had been driven from that of the physical philosophers. However, the personality or theological explanation of things persisted for the masses of the people, and in some degree, for the philosophers themselves, throughout the period of Greek culture and came down through the philosophers of the middle ages to the present day. The philosophic language of the learned classes was henceforth to be metaphysical.1 No matter how dark the times seemed to be or under how much of an eclipse learning found itself, this continued to be the case until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Under the metaphysical type of theory or epistemology, there was a radical change in the location of the imputed cause of 1This transformation in language was effected and maintained because the new language of depersonalized intelligence and force was better adapted to accurate description of what goes on in the world. It is a step in the direction of the removal of the mystical element in causation and in the substitution therefor of a mech- anistic, and therefore an objectively measurable, process of causation.</page><page sequence="2">618 The Journal of Social Forces events or phenomena. Under the theological ex? planation the effective cause was supposed to lie outside of the event in the mind or will of some personality or divinity. According to the meta? physical explanation in its later development, the cause was transferred to within the object in the form of its essence or essential principle or the nature of the thing. Thus, in the human being it was reason which directed action, while in the universe as a whole it was nous or universal reason. According to Aristotle it was the nature of the slave which made him a slave and the nature of the master which caused him to be the natural ruler over the slave. In Aristotle's sys? tem, human relationships are supposed to be de- termined by the natures of the individuals in the society. The elements, earth, fire, air, and water, also have their separate natures which constitute their identities and cause them to function as they do. However, this transferrence of the casual principle from without to within did not occur suddenly. It underwent a gradual evolution in process. The personality of the gods was gen- eralized and abstracted by the philosophers (or thinkers) into the principle of nous and this uni? versal principle or essence was conceived as ex- tending itself into individual phenomena, includ- ing human personalities and social groups, on the analogy of the way in which spirits had been supposed to enter men and things according to the theological explanation. According to the metaphysical principle, the ultimate causes of phe? nomena, including human action, were still con? ceived of as existing without the object or situa? tion in which the phenomena occurred. The net gain from this new principle of explanation lies in the fact that, instead of the old fiatistic ex? planation of the theological or presonality causa? tion theory, the metaphysical essence, or nous, is conceived of as extending into the object which it works upon, and it thereby becomes the direct- ing principle or essence of the controlled object. Thus, when extended to the human being, the universal intelligence or love or spirit of justice (nous) becomes reason or sympathy or righteous? ness, and guides the person affected accordingly. In this way a crude beginning of psychology is made. Analysis of the mechanism of the reacting or acting object is begun. And, later, as attention comes to be more and more concentrated on the inner mechanism aspect, the external causative power, nous, tends to drop out of the explanation in its immediate statement. In this way a general, all-pervading, external metaphysical principle, through its extension into the individual phenomenon, came to be also a specific, internal causal factor; and in the course of time the external aspect came to be further abstracted away from the perception of direct causation. Thus the concept of nous was further abstracted and transformed and was left more or less suspended in the philosophic and cosmic atmospheres as natural law. Natural law was thus evidently a concept unconsciously derived by analogy from human law, and it was applied to this universal harmony or order known as nous after it (nous) had been relegated to the abstract and dispossessed of its concrete tangible casual character. By being extended to the internal mechanism as reason (in human objects) or force (in physical objects), the attention shifted in large degree from the background cause to the immediate pro? cess. Thus the sense of immanency and of per? sonality still further faded from nous and it be? came merely an abstraction, depersonalized into law. The term nous itself ultimately disappeared from the language of philosophy. However this new background substitute for universal creative intelligence (nous), was by no means as im- personal as is our modern concept of scientific law. It was not possible for the human mind to make so quickly the transition from a personal universe to an impersonal one, from gods to principles. Natural law was among the Greeks and all through the middle ages looked upon as an original cause, as a sort of highly abstract or essential guiding intelligence, and man, as well as inanimate objects, were regarded as functioning under its supervision. We can find in the history of thought abundant examples of this process of transference from the concrete external personal causation to a concrete internal particular causation, with the other two types of causation lying in the background; the former often disappearing wholly or in large part from the view of the philosophers, if not from that of the masses. Plato's idea (another name for nous) which lay back of the concrete phe? nomenon as the perfect model, of which the earthly thing was but an imperfect copy, was of</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Social Forces 619 this metaphysical conceptual character. The ex? tension of the external metaphysical reality into the concrete object was but imperfect and partial. Socrates* dcemon, which had its seat in the head and which told him what to do, was also, more abstractly considered, the principle of reason by means of which he sought to discover truth by exposing error through dialectic or discussion. It is obvious that sometimes he looked upon his doemon as almost a personality or a spirit resident within him, while at other times he thought of it as merely an abstract principle or essence. The theological implications of Plato's idea are also to be observed in the fact that he conceived it as existing in heaven or the skies and in some of his writings he personified this principle. Aristotle identified the abstract principle of nous with a general concept of deity or god, especially with an oriental and Hindu flavor. The Hindu phi? losophy itself, in its concept of Nirvana and the unconscious harmony lying back of the existence known to our senses, is based on essentially the same principle of interpretation, blending in a mystical unity the concepts of theology and of metaphysics. None the less is the pantheism of the philo- sophic theologians of the seventeenth and eight- eenth centuries in Europe a philosophic attempt to transform theology into metaphysics in the field of religion, under the title of deism. In pantheism, the personal god was transformed into a universal essence operating upon man and direct- ing human affairs. The attributes of the divine personality had become general principles of omniscience, omnipresence, all-goodness, and the like. The attributes remained, but the personality was gone. Grotius, Maimonides, Aquinas and others had already relegated the concept of di- vinity to a secondary position in the universe by declaring that, although God was the author of natural law, he could not himself alter it or set it aside, once it had been created.2 By such tokens metaphysics won out in the struggle against theology for dominance even in its last great stronghold, that of religion.8 Metaphysical explanations had already taken possession of the philosophy of social phenomena in the form of the theories of the social contract and the philosophy of history. In the field of physical phenomena the metaphysical explanation had reached its height in its long ascent from the days of the early Greek physical philosophers and was now on the downward track, giving way rapidly before the new methods of science first hinted at by Aristotle and given preliminary logical definition by the penetrating mind of Roger Bacon. Francis Bacon had argued for the application of scientific methods to the field of social phenomena and this method of explanation was soon to begin. In the nineteenth century the last great stand of both theology and metaphysics was made in a joint defense against the aggres- sions of the new physical and biological sciences under the banner of natural theology as set forth in the Bridgewater treatises and many smaller works. A somewhat similar, though separate and weaker, defense is now being made in the fields of the mental and social sciences under the name of Fundamentalism. With this change in the explanatory philoso- phies there came also a transformation in the con? cept of progress. The metaphysical concept of progress was measurably more robust intellectu- ally than the theological theory. This was true for two reasons. First, the decline of the per? sonality explanation freed the concept of human improvement from a certain whimsical or arbi- trary element and also from the sense of sin which was conceived as affecting the cosmic order itself through its reaction upon the mind of the divinity. In the second place, there was something in? evitable and forward moving about the natural law or the natural order of things (nous) which supplanted the personalistic concept of divinities in the minds of the philosophers. Man's fate was now in the bosom of the universe itself, not in the lap of the gods. The same basic principle or order which kept the planets in their spheres and which caused the sun to rise and set daily was also the mainspring of the action of man and of his social order. Their local worlds had grown from the limits set by the tribal god to be as broad as the universe itself. Men were no longer pawns of the will of a greater personality, subject to anthropomorphic jealousies, loves, hates, and even defects of judgment and of efficiency, like their own. Their fates were the outgrowth of their own reasons, which were the extensions of natural *See Grotius, Law of War and Peace, and Maimonides, Guide to the Perplexed (Friedlander), Vol. 2, p. 87. 8 For a distinction between theology and religion (concepts which are generally confused as identical) see the author*s arti? cle on "Religion and Theology," The Monxst, Jan., 1922.</page><page sequence="4">620 The Journal of Social Forces law operating directly through their own consci- ousnesses. Men developed personalities that were in a measure independent and self-directive. Direct observation and experience also make their contribution to a more expansive and positive theory of social progress. Man has made ad- vances in the physical arts, as well as in the art of thinking, and he has found the world a better place in which to live. Optimism grows with creature comforts and often becomes the un- witting mother of the most extravagant dreams. After the Dark Ages, which were dark rather because of the insecurity of life and property than because of the total decadence of the arts, the world again blossomed with surplus and lifted itself out of the theologically minded refuge of despair in another life and another world and began again to concoct plans for the exploitation and enjoyment of this life and to invent theories for the interpretation of the social and cosmic relations in the present human order on earth. By this time also there was enough recorded history to enable the philosophers to gain some perspective of historical development or progress. The philosophy of history was itself emerging. Plato tells the story of the growth of human society from the family to the city state, in lan? guage that was to a fair degree accurately de- scriptive of the more recent phase of social evo? lution in that part of the world. Aristotle re- peats the story, with only minor variations. St. Augustine also has a series of three ascending epochs, culminating in the age of grace or the reign of Christ. But it remained for Vico, in the early eighteenth century, to formulate the theory of the philosophy of history and in it to harmonize theology and metaphysics as causal concepts. For all of these men, as well as for the Philosophers of the Enlightenment in France, there was a sort of inevitableness to progress. The unfolding of history was the natural and inevitable product of the operation of natural law, operating either as a perfect will and thought of God or as an independent and universal essence. But progress was not necessarily con- tinuous. None of the earlier writers had the notion of continuous or unbroken progress. The observers of history even in Greek times were able to per- ceive the development of social institutions, of conveniences and culture, which had culminated in the brilliant age of Pericles and in the Athenian supremacy. But they also had witnessed phases of decline, and the philosophers who followed Plato and Aristotle were particularly aware of the declining culture of their age. The Epicur- eans are symptomatic of the growing perception that not all is right with the world and hence the theory that the wise will salvage for their enjoy- ment what is possible. The Stoics bowed to the inevitable and developed a recessive philosophy, turning inward for satisfactions of the soul when objective welfare adjustments could no longer be counted upon. In a still darker world St. Augus? tine urges true Christians to turn their hopes away from this world to the hereafter, where the kingdom of God is to be realized. All of these theories of life and of the values of life are sub- jective, because the objective social world was more or less in a condition of collapse. The early metaphysical view of progress, in the light of these limited observations from history and from life, was in the main a circular one. Ancient history was replete with examples of the termination of civilizations by conquest and the rise of new powers upon the wreckage of the old. Nor did it appear to be in the nature of things, judged from a metaphysical viewpoint, to cease entirely. Such would seem to be inconsistent with the all-pervasiveness of the universal prin? ciple of balance, nous. All things, were, meta- physically speaking, a becoming, that is, the re? sult of the penetration of nous or of natural law. There could be no end of things without the destruction of nous or of nature itself. Things might undergo changes in phase and still be in accordance with natural harmony, but phases would recur, or come or become again. Hence the natural order of things, including human de? velopment and the growth of human institutions, was cylical or recurrent. Both the individual life cycle and all the history that the Greeks knew pointed the same moral. In the individual and in the race life was repetition. The theory of metempsychosis was but the individual comple- ment of the social hypothesis of the rise and fall of peoples and civilizations. The gods might destroy, because they were personalities and out? side of the things or processes which they cre- ated; but nature on the other hand could not</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Social Forces 621 destroy objects without destroying herself, for things were extensions or phases of this nature. Continuous regression is therefore primarily a theological rather than a metaphysical doctrine. But we have seen that even the theological view of regression is finally transformed, by a process of shifting the scene from the past to the future and from the earth to heaven, with the result that progress takes the place of regression, but in a different age or in a higher sphere. This theological concept of the succession of progress to regression in a higher sphere or plane as set forth by St. Augustine and the metaphysical theory of recurrent cycles are fit forerunners of, and perhaps logical antecedents, to the meta? physical doctrine of progress in a spiral curve as set forth by Vico. It is fitting that Vico should be the one to transform this theological concept into a metaphysical one, for it is Vico, more than any one else, who brings the philosophy of his? tory into being as a metaphysical discipline and yet keeps it connected with theology by assuming that all natural law or process is the objectifica- of the mind or thinking of God. It is mainly through him among the moderns that the system- atic discussion of social phenomena makes its way from theology to metaphysics and becomes subject to a law of logic (natural law) instead of to a law of will (divine fiat) in its inter? pretation.4 There is historical inductive justification for the supplanting of the metaphysical circular con? cept by the metaphysical spiral concept of pro? gress, just as there was historical warrent for the birth of the concept of circular progress in the first place. With the approach of modern times the more exact data of history made it apparent that while periods of progressive expansion of culture and comfort, of knowledge and technique, were followed by other periods of relative de? cline of culture and knowledge and welfare, there was never a complete return to the old condition of affairs. Vico, for example, saw clearly that some technique, some knowledge, were preserved and made available for each succeeding loop in the spiral. Thus each new start around the circle which lies within the form of the spiral is at a 4 Of course there are examples of such discussion in Augustine, Aquinas, and others, but they are fragmentary rather than sys- tematic, partial rather than consecutive and continuous in their outlook. higher level than the preceding one. Likewise the gods which Vico posits for the new age of gods in the dark ages of Europe are much more abstract and intellectual and puritanical than those of the earlier age of the gods before Hom- er's time. Also the heroes are subject to the same characterization by comparison. Dante is a meta? physical poet, while Homer was a narrative bard, singing the song of personal deeds, not of ideas and principles. Likewise, he thinks, the new age of men will be one of democracy and science rather than an age of aristocracy and philosophy, however great were the times of the magnificent Athenian intellectual trinity. It was the new science of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, coming so soon after the great voyages of discovery which had fired the imaginations of men in the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries, together with the economic ex? pansion of the last hundred and fifty years, which prepared the way for the theory of continuous and unbroken progress and the doctrine of the unlimited perfectability of the human spirit as set forth by Condorcet, Helvetius, and their con- temporaries. But if scientific achievement stimu- lated a belief in unlimited and continuous pro? gress in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the theory of progress did not itself become scien? tific in those centuries. Social progress remained a metaphysical concept, but again it found the data to justify its contentions in the field of history and contemporary events. The knowledge and comfort and technic control of man over nature had reached such proportions in those centuries that to many it seemed as if there could never again be any regression, even in the relative de? gree indicated by the spiral curve. The warn- ing voice of Malthus either went unheeded or was quieted by a din of resentful protest, much as the mob cries down the speaker whom it re- gards as a pessimist today. The more incorrigible optimists or high priests of the inevitability of progress are unaffected even by the warning note that our natural resources are already in a stage of decline. These people who can hear or see only what fits their dogmas and gives them the satisfaction of the day-dream still have much of the spirit of the theologian and the metaphysician, persistently believing either that providence will not permit a hair of the heads of the faithful to</page><page sequence="6">622 The Journal of Social Forces be injured or, like Matthew Arnold, that there is some power or principle in the universe which inevitably works for human welfare. The doctrine of evolution has aided not a little in the establishment, or at least in the confirming, of this dogma of inevitable and continuous pro? gress. So overwhelming has been the body of data amassed to prove and to illustrate the evo- lutionary principles of derivation and continuity of transmission that the human mind has been crushed under its weight. Instead of the pro? cesses of evolution being viewed as continuous and related phenomena which we apprehend in perspective, they are interpreted from an anthro- pocentric standpoint, with man at the end of the series, and are evaluated as inevitable and as pro? gressive. Evolution in the abstract and as an objective concept of continuity knows nothing of progress or will or purpose as any other anthro- pocentric concepts or points of view. To assume such a standpoint of interpretation is to read into the processes themselves personality or objective and self-existent principles and thus to reduce them to the categories of theological or meta? physical dogmas or doctrines. Such, of course, is what we have actually in large part done, espe? cially on the metaphysical side, and the result is that we travel in a vicious circle. Evolution is used to demonstrate continuous and inevitable progress, and progress is made the central element in the prevailing concept of evolution. However, the incurable and, we might almost say, pernicious optimists?the town criers of a sentimental and anthropomorphic and anthropo- centric theory of evolution?are now neither so numerous nor so persistent as they once were. Dean Inge even doubts that there has been pro? gress at all6 and Mr. Shafer is alarmed lest the gospel of progress?particularly inevitable and irresponsible progress?may do irreparable harm, both to the progressivists and, we are tempted to believe, to those who would let well enough for themselves alone.6 The limitations which exist to human progress in nature itself, in the form of inadequate supplies of natural resources, climatic and geological changes, possibly even in cosmic changes also, are beginning to be appre- ciated.7 The metaphysical and analogical theories of progress are now more frequently stated in some modified curvilinear form, sometimes as a zigzag or as a sympodial structure.8 For the sci? entific theorists of social progress, the elements of inevetableness and naturalness or innateness have dropped out altogether.9 This is true even with respect to the doctrine of the instincts?a meta? physical dogma of innate essences which are reputed to direct the individual to certain inevi? table courses of conduct?which has now lost its standing, among scientists, at least in so far as it lays claim to the hereditary determination of so? cial and moral character.10 * The Idea of Progress. * Robert Shafer, Science and Progress.
