Arruda The University of Michigan Clifford C. Chou Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Characterization of materials used in the automotive industry is often done via component testing. A strict regimen of tests is conducted on a component to determine material parameters for numerical simulations of more complicated loading conditions. Separation of material constants and geometrically- or experimentally- induced effects is difficult with this method of characterization. Well-controlled experiments that determine the material response in basic deformations allow material properties to be determined. In this paper low strain rate and high strain rate experimental responses of dummy skin material (i.e. plasticized polyvinyl chloride) are presented. Details of the experimental procedures used to acquire the data are also included. In addition, a rate-dependent constitutive model for the plasticized material is developed, and its simulated results are compared with low strain rate results. INTRODUCTION Instrumented anthropomorphic test devices of dummies are traditionally used in crash tests for assessing their performance with respect to safety standards. Current computer-aided engineering (CAE) methodology uses finite element dummy models for simulations to evaluate dummy responses in various crash environments. In order to provide better dummy model simulation capability, safety analysts need to understand the behavior of the dummy skin material which is made of plasticized poly-vinyl chloride (PPVC). An experimental investigation of several PPVC materials was conducted to characterize their responses at both low and high strain rates, and the results can be used for developing their respective constitutive models. The low strain rate tests were run on an MTS Ford Motor Company machine, while the high strain rate tests were conducted using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) technique. These are described below. LOW STRAIN RATE RESPONSE The mechanical responses of several PPVC compounds were studied at low strain rates under large deformation uniaxial compression. A range of strain rates -0.001 /s to - 1 0/s was used to explore the rate dependent response of PPVC. Cyclic deformations were used to characterize the viscoeiastic/viscoplastic response of the material including hysteresis, permanent set, strain-induced stress-softening, and cyclic response saturation. MATERIAL COMPOSITION - The materials used for the experimental investigation were plasticized poly-vinyl chloride compounds. Blends with 30d, 40d, 50d, and 70d Shore A durometer hardness values were used in this investigation. The unplasticized PVC is far below its glass transition temperature, Tg, at room temperature and therefore its response is expected to be typical of a glassy polymer, whereas at room temperature the 50d PPVC is well above its glass transition temperature and therefore is in the rubbery regime. MECHANICAL TESTING PROCEDURES - The experimental procedures used to generate the low strain rate experimental data presented herein were primarily uniaxial compression on an MTS-810 servohydraulic testing machine for strain rates up to -10/s. The compression tests were conducted at constant strain rates, thus allowing rate dependent response characterization. The uniaxial compression experiments were conducted to impart a homogeneous deformation state within the specimen. Well-lubricated, ground and polished platens were used to reduce the frictional effects, insuring nearly homogeneous deformation. 835</page><page sequence="2">HIGH STRAIN RATE RESPONSE VIA THE SPLIT HOPKINSON PRESSURE BAR TECHNIQUE The large deformation, high strain rate, uniaxial response of plasticized poly-vinyl chloride was investigated using the SHPB technique. Most published data on the high strain rate response of polymers come from two experimental techniques, cyclic torsion or compression and impact. The cyclic tests are conducted at high frequencies, but only achieve strains on the order of a few percent. The impact tests can achieve high deformation rates and large displacements, but produce nonuniform strain rates and often nonuniform deformations. The split Hopkinson pressure bar was designed to produce uniform deformation, high strain rate, uniaxial conditions in metal specimens and has subsequently been applied to ceramics and composites. Few successful SHPB apparatuses for soft materials exist. The SHPB test is a high rate dynamic test based upon the physics of wave propagations in solids. Referring to the generic schematic of the SHPB in Figure 1 , As, Al, and AT are the area of the striker bar, the incident bar, and the transmitted bar, respectively, whereas the area of the specimen is denoted by Ao. In theory each of the areas can be distinct, but in practice the striker, incident bar and transmitter bar each have the same cross- sectional area. In this study, these three areas are assumed to be equivalent and the area of the specimen differs. The other quantities in Figure 1 denoted by subscript i are those associated with the incident bar; the T subscript designates transmitter bar variables and parameters, and 0 subscripts refer to specimen properties. The speed of sound in a solid is defined in terms of its Young's modulus, E, and density, p, as C = (E/p)1/2. The acoustic impedance of a material is defined as pC. Striker Specimen I=l ' ■ l-J - ■ ' I - ^ Incident Bar ^ Transmitter Bar ļ C„E„ A, ^ a ^ ^ • S T C-pE-r, At Figure 1 . Generic SHPB. A compression wave is induced in the SHPB apparatus via the striker bar. Referring to Figure 1, the striker is propelled at a velocity Vs. Upon impact with the incident bar an elastic stress wave begins traveling through the incident bar. As the wave exits the incident bar and enters the specimen it encounters a boundary. The acoustic impedance mismatch at the bar/specimen interface causes part of the wave to be reflected from the surface and travel back through the incident bar while part of the wave is transmitted to the specimen. Equilibrium conditions and continuity at the interface determine the amplitude and sense of the reflected wave pulse. In all of the analyses to follow, the acoustic impedances of the incident and transmitter bars are assumed to be greater than that of the specimen. For a specimen that is much softer than the incident bar, the specimen diameter is chosen to be smaller than the bar diameter. The difference in areas accommodates radial expansion of the specimen during compression. Refraction of a wave can occur, however, due to the geometric discontinuity at the interface created by the difference in specimen and bar diameters. Refraction results in multiple wavelengths traveling in the bars and introduces non-longitudinal wave components. These components can distort the incident wave and will, in general, create three-dimensional wave components which can complicate the analysis. The portion of the wave that is transmitted to the specimen travels through the specimen and encounters an interface at the transmitter bar surface. Reflection, transmission, and refraction can all occur at this interface as well. The reflected portion of the wave in the incident bar and the transmitted portion of the wave in the transmitter bar are related to the deformation rate in the specimen and the force at the specimen faces, respectively. These relationships will be discussed in detail later in the Classical Analysis section. Several assumptions are necessary to apply the SHPB to material testing. These basic assumptions of the analysis are: 1. one dimensional wave propagation theory is valid (i.e. no non-longitudinal waves), 2. Inertia of the specimen in the longitudinal and radial directions is negligible, 3. frictlonal effects at the specimen-bar boundaries are also negligible, 4. the deformation and stress in the specimen are uniform along the compression axis. The SHPB was devised to study metallic specimens which characteristically display linearly elastic responses at small strains. Classical SHPB analysis is based upon an assumption of homogeneous deformation within the specimen. Experimental investigations reveal that the deformation during a SHPB compression is initially not uniform. During the initial stages the axial deformation is more inhomogeneous than it is at later stages of tests. The homogeneous deformation assumption is typically made since the amount of time during which the specimen experiences inhomogeneity during equilibration is short relative to the amount of time that the specimen deforms. As the stress wave propagates through the specimen a uniform deformation is produced and equilibration is achieved. 836</page><page sequence="3">CLASSICAL ANALYSIS - Relating the stress and strain in the specimen to the reflected strain in the incident bar and the transmitted strain in the transmitter bar is achieved by assuming one dimensional wave propagation in a long, slender rod (See Figure 1). The conservation of linear momentum relates the striker velocity to the stress in the incident bar as S|=p|VsC|. Assuming that the incident bar is deforming elastically such that s^E^i where e-| is the strain, we have C|e| = Vs. The nominal strain rate in the specimen and specimen face velocities are related by de0 _ Vl(t)-V2(t) - ďf _ L¡ (1) where Vļand V2are the velocities of the specimen faces, and L0 is the initial specimen length. The face velocities of the specimen can be expressed in terms of the incident, reflected, and transmitted strains through V-|=C| (e| - eR) and V2=C| eT. The strain rate from Eq. (1) can be rewritten as A _ de0 _ C|(6|(t)-eR(t)-eT(t)) /ox 0 _ ~ "dT _ L0 /ox (¿) Integrating the rate expression with the assumption that the length of the specimen remains constant yields, e0 = rf [e,(t)-eR(t)-eT(t)]dt (3) Lo 0 Force balance across the specimen gives (see Figure 1), So . ,4) where, F1(t) = Al El(el(t) + eR(t)) and F2(t) = Al EleT(t) such that, so = + •«&lt;» + M1)) (S) Assuming enough time has elapsed for the specimen to reach equilibrium F1(t) = F2(t) and el(t) + eR(t) = eT(t). The stress in the specimen from Eq. (5) can thus be rewritten as s0 = EAeT(t) (6) Mo where E and A are now taken to represent the modulus in the bar and the area of the bar, respectively, and the subscript is dropped from the stress. The strain rate becomes 2C é = - r^Optt) (7) ""O and the strain may be found from e(t) = [eR(t)]dt (8) where C represents the bar wave speed and the subscript is dropped from the strain for notational ease. With these assumptions s and e represent the average stress and strain in the specimen (i.e. the stress and strain are taken to be uniform throughout the specimen). The above analysis relies heavily on the homogeneous stress and strain field assumptions. At the onset of the test the specimen face in contact with the incident bar begins moving while the face in contact with the transmitter bar is at rest. The initial strain field is therefore nonuniform. Studies have shown that the assumption of uniform stress and strain (i.e. equilibrium) does not introduce prohibitive error in the analysis of metallic specimens[1]. There is concern regarding the uniform stress and strain assumption in soft materials[2,3]. Zhao reported that for certain materials (rocks, concretes, polymeric foams, etc.), the classical analysis cannot be utilized because the assumption of uniform deformation is invalid. The microstructural discontinuities of the materials indicated by Zhao justify the claim. Many polymers and elastomers, however, have homogeneous microstructures and classical analysis should not be dismissed without further consideration. Classical analysis is based upon the assumption that the deformation is occurring isothermally. It is possible that the deformation is occurring adiabatically or with some temperature rise and heat transfer due to the high rate at which work is being done. Numbers in brackets [] indicate references at the end of the paperon the specimen. This paper assumes that the deformation occurs isothermally.1 SOFT MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS Gary and Zhao have presented a novel SHPB in which the bars are made of polymeric materials to study rate effects in foams and other soft materials[3,4]. The Gary and Zhao polymeric SHPB allowed the use of larger specimen diameters than a metal SHPB would allow because the polymer bar has an acoustic impedance close to that of the specimen. The microstructure of foam is such that a finite amount of material is required to capture a representative volume therefore large specimens are desirable. Their polymeric SHPB allowed sufficiently sized specimens to be tested. Gary and Zhao present the analysis necessary to account for the nonlinear modulus and rate dependent behavior of the bars. Their technique has been implemented at the University of Dayton Research Institute by Sawas and Brar who outlined the viscoelastic data analysis required to interpret the data from an all polymeric SHPB[6J. Numerous dynamic tests are required to characterize the 1 . Numbers in brackets [] indicate references at the end of the paperon the specimen. This paper assumes that the deformation occurs isothermally. 837</page><page sequence="4">viscoelastic bars in an all polymeric SHPB. The viscoelastic model used to match the dynamic characterization data is determined to best fit the test conditions. Moreover, aging effects will alter the response of polymeric bars over time. Under an impact test of variable strain rate the validity of the technique is questionable. Metallic bars such as aluminum alloys are favorable to polymeric bars, since the material properties of metals are rate-independent at room temperature for a larger range of stresses than are the polymeric bars. For specimens with homogeneous microstructures or materials that have a relatively small representative volume, a metal SHPB/specimen geometry combination can be designed to study high strain rate response of soft materials without resorting to low impedance, highly nonlinear, viscoelastic polymer bars. Figure 2. Schematic of the UMISHPB. The University of Michigan SHPB (UMISHPB) was designed for testing polymers at high rates and is schematically depicted in Figure 2. The apparatus uses an air gun to propel the striker bar. The air gun is capable of handling supply pressures up to 17 MPa and striker bars up to 6.6 mm diameter. The gun's trigger is a hand- operated valve which is functionally equivalent to a spring-loaded poppet valve. The incident and transmitter bars are supported in self-aligning, linear bearings mounted to allow pitch, yaw, and vertical adjustments and assure proper alignment. Improper alignment of the apparatus results in significant wave dispersion and substantial errors in the calculations. Commonly available surface-mounted, electrical resistance strain gages were used to determine the strains in the bars. The placement of the gages along the bars was determined to allow sufficient time for long pulse signals to reach the gages and yet not overlap. The gages were placed in a half bridge configuration for self-cancellation of bar bending. The bars were calibrated statically to assure proper gage bonding and to account for bridge imbalance effects in the gages, soldering, and lead wires. The bridge amplifiers utilized are Strain Measurement Group Model 231 OA 75kHz signal conditioners. This frequency response is adequate for most materials, but should be verified for materials that require fast pulse rise times. The data were recorded on a two channel 100MHz digital oscilloscope, Hewlett Packard model 5464A. The material selected for the bars was commercially available 2024-T6 aluminum rod. The dimensions of the incident, transmitter, and striker bars were determined to minimize dispersion effects, allow the waves to be separable, reduce the inertial and frictional influences, and produce adequate strain in the specimen. The minimization of dispersion effects can be achieved by selection of an appropriate incident bar length-to-diameter ratio (l/d). In practice an incident bar I/ d ratio of greater than 20 is often used. This ratio results from numerous research efforts to account for end effects in the incident wave. The end effects are negligible after the wave has traveled more than ten bar diameters along the axis of the incident bar (it is akin to St. Venant's restrictions in solid mechanics). The minimum bar l/d is also determined by the ability to separate the incident and reflected waves as they will both travel across the same strain gage. The general rule governing wave separability is that the l/d should exceed 100. Moreover, for bar length-to-diameter ratios exceeding 100 the dispersion effects according to Pochhammer-Chree theory would be minimal. For the UMISHPB the l/d is 333 which is well above limits of one-dimensional propagation and wave separability. Static and dynamic calibrations of the UMISHPB were conducted. The static calibration was performed on a 2 m long horizontal, servohydraulic testing machine. The results indicated a linear relationship between strain in the bar measured by the servohydraulic testing machine and the output of the surface-mounted gages. The dynamic calibration consisted of two independent methods: first the calculated stress versus strain results of poly-carbonate (PC) were compared to published data, and second high speed images were collected and used to determine the actual longitudinal strain along the specimen centerline at various times during an experiment to compare against the strain gage data. The PC stress versus strain results agreed favorably with the published data and the calculated strains from classical analysis strongly correlated with the strains determined from the high speed photographs. Introducing large, uniform strain pulses over short time periods is necessary to probe a large range of the material deformation rate dependence. The use of large pulses produces experimental difficulties related to apparatus translation. The transfer of momentum from the striker to the incident and transmitter bars in a low friction setup requires long distances to stop the motion. A rigid stop at the far end of the transmitter bar would result in severe deformation or buckling of the bars. Nemat-Nasser et al.[7] outline the use of a momentum trap to control the strain pulses in tests of brittle materials. Their momentum trap consists of a concentric mass of specified length added concentrically along the incident bar to prevent tensile strains in the specimen normally created by the reflected pulse. A modification of the Nemat-Nasser momentum trap resulted in an efficient and simple translation control method. A large concentric 838</page><page sequence="5">mass was placed along the transmitter bar beyond the strain gage to significantly reduce the translation and not affect the pertinent strain pulse. The distribution of the mass axially along the transmitter bar minimized bending effects. Additionally, a viscous lubricant was smeared along the transmitter bar to create a rate dependent "soft stop" for the UMISHPB system and substantially reduce the translation. RESULTS LOW STRAIN RATE RESULTS - Quasi-static compression tests were used to characterize the isothermal response of PPVC at constant strain rate. Loading rates of -1/s and below resulted in near- isothermal conditions during all testing therefore adiabatic heating effects were not a concern. Uniaxial compression (UC) experiments were selected over other deformation modes because UC imparts a homogeneous deformation throughout the specimen. In other modes such as uniaxial tension, which is by far the most commonly used characterization test, nonuniform deformations and non-constant, nonuniform deformation rates occur in the specimen which complicate material characterization. In some test conditions separation of material characteristics and geometric or testing artifacts is impossible (e.g. determining the amount of material draw in from the grip section in a typical dog bone tension test); in compression, homogeneous, constant strain rate deformations are readily achieved. Figure 3. Stress versus strain response of various PPVC blends. Figure 3 shows the uniaxial compression responses of PPVC samples of different durometer hardness values. The specimens were compressed at a constant strain rate of -0.01 /s to a final strain of -100% followed by unloading at a constant strain rate of 0.01 /s. The response of unplasticized PVC is initially nearly linear elastic (E=72 GPa), followed by yield in compression at 73.8 MPa, subsequent softening and ultimately strain hardening as shown in Figure 4. The addition of the plasticizer in large quantities changes the character of the response markedly as seen in Figure 3. The PPVC samples exhibit responses more characteristic of an elastomer, low initial moduli and nonlinear stress vs. strain responses (i.e. the PPVC blends are in the leathery or rubbery regime). This observed response is similar to that of other polymers In which the addition of the plasticizer was shown to reduce the Tg of the blend to below room temperature. Furthermore, Figure 3 shows that the PPVC specimens dissipate a large amount of the input energy as indicated by the large hysteresis loops. The nonlinear elastic recovery mechanism that the material exhibits is evident in the shape of the unloading path and the small amount of residual strain. The figure also shows the effects of increasing plasticizer content. The initial modulus as well as the stress at -1 .0 decrease with increasing plasticizer level. Figure 4. True Stress vs True Strain curve of unplasticized PVC in uniaxial compression. Figure 5 contains the response of several PPVC blends at strain rates of -0.01/s and -0.1/s. Each PPVC blend displays an increase in stiffness with increase in strain rate. The figure also reveals that an increased strain rate leads to larger dissipative losses for each blend. The elastic response of polymers well below Tg is governed by bond stretching whereas, the above Tg response is governed by conformational rearrangements. Figure 5. True Stress vs True Strain curves of plasticized PVC blends. Figure 6 shows the low strain rate response of the 50d PPVC specimens during uniaxial compression. The specimens were compressed at a constant strain rate to final strains exceeding -85% followed by the immediate 839</page><page sequence="6">unloading at a constant strain rate equal in magnitude to the loading rate. The initial response for strain rates less than -10/s is relatively rate-independent. At strains beyond -20% the rate-dependent response is characterized by an increase in strain hardening with rate. The unloading response curves overlap as unloading is nearing completion. It can also be seen from Figure 6 that the initial unloading moduli (taken at approximately the first 5% of unloading strain) are the same for the various rates examined. The initial unloading phenomenon is, therefore, rate independent. As in other materials such as metals, the initial unloading response can be thought of as an elastic process since the strain at which unloading begins uniquely determines the initial unloading rate. Figure 6. Lowstrainratestressversusstrain response of 50d PPVC. Many polymers and metals exhibit response saturation after very few cycles. Experimental investigations of the cyclic response of polymers and elastomers are often conducted on specimens which have been preconditioned (i.e. test specimens are cycled until saturated response is achieved and then tested in the saturated state). This is not practical in many situations outside the laboratory. The cyclic response of PPVC was investigated through repeated constant strain rate compression tests. Figure 7 shows the cyclic response of 50d PPVC subjected to repeated cycling to the same terminal strain of -0.95. The material response exhibits stress-softening when reloading for subsequent cycling until 4 to 5 cycles. Also, the loading portion of the second cycle falls above the unloading path from the first cycle. This indicates that a healing or recovery process has taken place during unloading. (In many models of polymers applied to cyclic response this aspect is neglected[8-12].) The cyclic response ceases to change within 4 cycles with this PPVC blend, and the response is referred to as having saturated[13,14]. An initial cycle followed by a reload to a larger final strain shows another feature of this type of material as seen in Figure 8. The second cycle to larger strains appears to be a continuation of the first cycle beyond the initial strain range. Several studies have indicated that these cyclic stress-strain responses occur in both unfilled and filled rubbers. This unusual character is often referred to as the Mullins' effect, after Mullins whose early speculation about the molecular origins of the behavior are the basis for most filled elastomer models[13-15]. Figure 7. True stress vs true strain response of a specimen tested for multiple cycles. The PPVC shows a typical cyclic response of elastomers. Elastomers are crosslinked, high molecular weight polymers which can experience extremely large stretches and elastically return to their original shape. Dissipation occurs due to viscous effects involved in elastomer deformation resulting in large hysteresis loops. Extensive analytical, experimental and theoretical research has been conducted on elastomeric materials. The response of elastomers is governed by entropie stress generating mechanisms. A series of UC experiments were conducted at various temperatures to test for the entropie thermoelastic inversion phenomenon. Figure 9 shows the results of the UC tests performed at various temperatures. The initial modulus of the PPVC specimens decreases with increasing temperature. These results reveal that the PPVC compounds do not exhibit entirely entropically driven stresses. The most common physical explanation for the plasticizer's effect on the mechanical response is related to crystallinity. Nielsen and Landel report that PPVC blends are held together by a small amount of crystallinity (5 to 15%). Other researchers report that PVC contains small domains of crystallized material which can act as crosslinks when an external deformation is applied. Upon plasticization of PVC, the smaller plasticizer molecules facilitate the motion of the crystalline subdomains resulting in the PPVC specimens becoming more pliable than the PVC specimen. Tobolsky postulated that these microdomains might actually act as pseudo-crosslinks 840</page><page sequence="7">supporting the elastomeric-like behaviors observed in this study[16]. In some instances the plasticizer molecules were reported to permeate the subdomains and create added free volume[17,18]. The additional space alleviates local constraints allowing more conformations to be assumed and the plasticized material to be more rubber-like. Figure 8. True stress vs true strain response for a specimen subjected to increasing strain cycles. Reports claim that two crystal-like structures form in PVC during processing. A-crystallites form during polymerization, melt and do not reform upon cooling and, B-crystallites form only during cooling. Moreover, Rehm[19] speculates that the B-crystallites form a three- dimensional network within an amorphous matrix containing both PVC chains and plasticizer. The degradation and reformation of the crystallite network accounts for the mechanical and thermal property variations that are observed between plasticized and unplasticized PVC. Rehm investigated the influence of plasticizer on PVC by measuring the compression set (C- set) according to the standard ASTM D395/B. Figure 9. True stress vs true strain response in uniaxial compression at various temperatures. In summary, the experimental results obtained herein "have revealed that the temperature and composition dependence of PPVC have a similar form, while the rate dependent response does not share the same form. The mechanisms describing the temperature and composition dependencies can, therefore, be assumed to be coupled. Moreover, the rate dependent data indicate that the -1 0.0/s response marks the onset of transitional behavior where the material response is leathery as opposed to rubbery. RESULTS FROM THE UMISHPB- True stress versus true strain results should be reported when large deformations are involved. In large deformation analysis the differences between the nominal values and the true values of stress and strain become substantial. Extending classical analysis to account for the large deformations was done by assuming that the material was incompressible. For incompressible materials volume is conserved throughout deformation leading to AL = AqL0 where A and L are the current area and length and Aq and L0 are the original area and length, respectively. Combining incompressibility with the definition of true strain, e(t)=ln(L/l_o) =ln (Aso/As). Also, the true strain can be related to the nominal strain by e(t) = ln(k(t )) (g) where À(t)=1+e(t) is the axial stretch in the material. The true stress can be related to the nominal stress and the nominal strain (stretch) by o(t) = X(t)s(t). (10) The true stress vs. true strain results are obtained from Eqs. (9) and (10). Figures 10 through 12 show the stress versus strain response and output versus time data from a high strain rate experiments on 50d PPVC. In each figure the top two curves are produced using Eqs. (6) and (8). The bottom subfigures combine the stress and strain data by synchronizing the times from the individual components. The results of the classical analysis outlined earlier are plotted as nominal stresses and nominal strains. For large deformations, as is seen in these experiments, nominal strain values deviate substantially from the actual strains in the material. True strains must be used for quantitative purposes. The logarithmic strain was used to represent the true strains in these results. For an incompressible material the conversion between the nominal and true values is straightforward. The results of the conversion appear in the lower right subfigures in Figures 10-12. In addition, the specimens recover their original dimensions when measured after the SHPB compression test. 841</page><page sequence="8">Figure 10. SHPB Response of Sample E Figure 1 1 . SHPB Response of Sample H. Figure 12. SHPB Response of Sample L Figure 13 displays the true stress vs. true strain results from Samples E, H, and L. The test conditions are summarized in Table 1 . The data in Figure 13 were taken from tests conducted over a range of strain rates from 6000/s - 8500/s and clearly show that the material response in this range of strain rates ceases to exhibit significant rate dependence. Figure 14 shows a direct comparison of the strains calculated via classical analysis and the strains determined from a high-speed photographic image. The determination of the axial strain from the high-speed images was done graphically. A still image was projected onto a flat surface and the perimeter of the specimen was traced onto paper. The tracing was then measured and the strains were calculated from these measurements. The strains calculated from the projected images are true strains. The nominal strain curve (N) is the result of the Classical Analysis. The true strain curve (T) is calculated based upon incompressibility. The open circles represent the results of the photographic analysis. As seen in the figure the true strain computed from classical analysis and adjusted for incompressibility and the measured strains agree favorably. Table 1 .

Comparison of response of PPVC at various strain rates. Figure 14. Results of high-speed photographic analysis. DISCUSSION - The results of the SHPB experiments conducted on PPVC show that the UMISHPB is capable of producing high strain rate stress versus strain data valid in the large strain regime. Controlling the length-to- diameter ratios of the incident bar and the specimen, coupled with the selection of aluminum as the incident bar material, allows low impedance materials to be tested in an SHPB apparatus. By comparing the output of the UMISHPB test conducted on poly-carbonate with the published data the accuracy of the calibration of the UMISHPB is established. Moreover, the true strains found using the UMISHPB agree with the strains measured with the projection method using photographic images. The projection method also provides true radial strain values for the determination of Poisson's ratio. The strain rate response of the modulus of PPVC appears to be negligible below -1/s and above -5000/s while undergoing a transition in the strain rate range between - 1/s and -5000/s. Below - 1/s the material response is dictated mainly by entropie interactions in which large portions of the molecules move cooperatively. As the strain rate is increased more energetic interactions occur and as a result the modulus increases. Beyond -5000/s the interactions are primarily energetic resulting in a high modulus. CONSTITUTIVE MODEL The above results were used to determine the material constants for a constitutive model of PPVC. The model is nonlinear viscoelastic-viscoplastic which was developed for use in describing the rate dependent response of PPVC. It is based on the three parameter model of Arruda and Boyce[20j. Uniaxial Compression Simulations Figure 15 compares the results from the simulation of uniaxial compression at =-0.01 /s with the corresponding experimental data. It can be seen from Figure 1 5 that the model accurately describes the stress-strain response of the material at this rate. The model closely matches the initial nonlinear elastic response and subsequent large deformation response. Of particular interest is the viscous response beyond . Both the data and the model show a reduced rate of strain hardening beyond this strain. The barrier to viscous flow combined with the gradual accumulation of viscoplastic strain causes the model to strain harden at a decreasing rate. The unloading response of the model follows the experimental data as well. Figures 16 and 17 present the simulated and experimental results from the other low rate compression experiments presented earlier in Figure 6. The model predictions of the stress-strain response of cyclic uniaxial compression show favorable agreement with the experimental data for both loading and unloading responses. Figure 17 shows the stress versus strain simulation results for a strain rate of e = -10.0/s. The simulated loading response is in good agreement with the experimental data. The simulated unloading response displays hysteresis, but does not completely describe the data. The model is unable to accumulate inelastic deformation and therefore the viscoelastic and viscoplastic elements are inactive for this rate. At higher rates less hysteresis is suggested by the trends in the low rate simulations. The description of the nonlinear viscoelastic-viscoplastic model as well as high strain rate response prediction will be the focus of future publications. 843</page><page sequence="10">Figure 15.

CONCLUSIONS Several PPVC compounds were studied at both low and high strain rates under large deformation. The low strain rate responses of PPVC were investigated using an MTS servohydraulic testing machine, while the high strain rate tests were done using the split Hopkinson pressure bar technique. The low strain rate results revealed that the response of PPVC depends on composition, loading rate, and temperature. Also, the PPVC blends tested exhibited significant hysteresis when unloaded at a constant strain Tate. The high strain rate response of 50d PPVC is stiffer than its low rate response. Moreover, the stiffening of the response ceases for testing rates beyond -5000/s. The low rate data presented were used to determine the model constants for a viscous constitutive theory that could be used to predict the strain rate dependence of PPVC blends. The basis of the model was the Arruda and Boyce model of glassy polymers.The modified Arruda-Boyce model has the potential to predict the unloading response of the plasticized material over a range of strain rates. The application of the model to higher strain rates will be studied in future works. Addition experimental work is underway to conduct SHPB experiments in the strain rate range between -10/s and -1000/s. REFERENCES 1. M.R. Staker. ASM Metals Handbook: Volume 8.
