<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nachrichten / News and Notes Oaxaca: Call for Protection of the Chimalapas Region m MEXICO, D. F. (Excelsior). Yet another Mexican région of great ecological importance is in danger of extinction: the Chimalapas jungle, located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec where the federal states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Veracruz meet. This was announced by the Group of the Hundred (Grupo de los Cien) under the leadership of the poet Homero Aridjis and by the head of the Pacto de Grupos Ecológicos, Gabriel Quadri, who appealed to Mexican authorities, Mexi can Citizens, and international public opinion for help in calling for a project to save this zone. The jungle région of ca. 800,000 hectares, one of the very last in the country and an important biotic reserve, is being increasingly subjected to illegal encroachment by petty farmers and cattle breeders. Valuable woodland is being destroyed in random fashion, and all manner of illegal procédures are reported in the zone, where the common borders of the three states, and thus the extent of the jurisdiction of each, are poorly defined at best. As if that were not enough, the Secretaría de Recursos Hidráulicos (Ministry of Water Resources) is planning aM large-scale dam project for the purpose of supplying water to the port of Salinas Cruz and its installations. Rio Azul Archaeological Project, Guatemala: The 1987 Season SAN ANTONIO (R. E. W. Adams). The final season of the Rio Azul Archaeological Project lasted from February 9 to April 22,1987 and was eut short by an outbreak of malaria in the zone. The agronomy studies were carried forward with a survey of possible hillside terracing within Rio Azul center. Investi gations were shifted to an area along the Kinal track and an extensive system of field walls was found which is associated with housemounds and a rural elite residential group. The chronology remains essentially unchanged from last year but with refinements and further detail added. First occupation was apparently ca. 1000 B.C. (Middle Preclassic ceramics) and ended ca. A.D. 880 (Terminal Classic). Excavations within the main site refined the sequence of</page><page sequence="2">constructional phases in A Group from the A-3 temple complex. The A-54 elite residential zone was explored, taking advantage of extensive looters' trenches and other excavations. New excavations were made and a sequence of Early Classic building phases were outlined. An important series of ceramic samples gave new information on the nature of the Teotihuacan presence at Rio Azul. Work in the B-56 elite residential complex was continued and information developed on the function and history of three other buildings in the group. The F-38 group is another elite residential group which has a long complex history beginning in the Late Preclassic with especial ly interesting materials from the Early Classic. Teotihuacan-related burials, ceramics, and other items were recovered. Excavation of the C-42 palace complex, the putative residence of "Ruler X" (buried in looted Tomb 1), was continued and several buried rooms were explored. Early Classic burials had been placed in the Chambers, but had been looted in Late Classic times. Even so, much interesting information was recovered. Again, the Teotihuacan presence was strong and unmistakable from this Early Classic palace. Structure G-103 is an enormous pile | (97,000 m.3) which was explored by both remote sensing and survey and excavation techniques this year. The outer plat form was a delibérate burial of a very large, Late Preclassic temple platform hidden within. The razing of the Preclassic temple and the burial of the elabórate platform is interpreted as an intentional defacement of the monuments of the prece ding rulers by the rulers of Tikal. According to data developed in 1986, the conquest of Rio Azul by Tikal with help from Teotihuacan took place in 377 A.D. Finally, a laboratory analysis done in 1987 provided results of special interest. Tomb 19, discovered in 1984, yielded a twist-top jar decorated with stucco medallions painted with hieroglyphs. In 1986 project epigrapher David Stuart read these glyphs as saying (in part) that the jar was intended to hold chocolate drinks. The ceramic vessel had been closed at the time it was found, and a dry residue within it was saved in a sealed glass vial. The residue was sent to Hershey Food Laboratories, which agreed to analyse it. Some months later the results came back to us indicating that the | residue is undoubtedly the remains of cacao. The Rio Azul Project will now enter a new phase in which we will begin to examine the région around the center in Order to define the economic, social, and political fabrics which sustained this major Maya city. 1987 Excavation and Restoration Work at Copan, Honduras HAMBURG (N. Grube/PARI). The second field season of the current Copan Mosaics Project directed by William Fash (Northern Illinois University) and co-directed by Rudy La rios (Universidad del Valle, Guatemala) began in January, 1987. The project, carried out under the auspices of the Instituto Hondurefio de Antropología e Historia (IHAH), has as its major goals the cleaning, reconstruction, and consoli dation of Temples 22 and 26 of the main acrópolis (Fig. 1). While digging Temple 22, an offering was found under the altar at the base of the Hieroglyphic Stairway. The offering consisted of three large eccentric flints, a censer of the sepultunar type, three stingray spines, and a flint knife. Also included were two jade offerings, one a statue of a squat male figure and the other a bar pectoral to be worn on a ruler ' s ehest. A spondylus shell with traces of human blood was also included in the offering. The offerings were chemically analyzed in Honduras and the United States and are now on display at the muséum in the village of Copán. Fig. 1. Restoration work on Structures 22 and 26. In the center the corner masks of Str. 22 are visible, the upper one having been reconstructed in 1987 (Photo: N. Grube, 1987) Tunneling into Temple 26 laid bare a large Preclassic stucco altar in the shape of an alligator. Three other structures with offerings of broken jade and a large amount of carbón in good condition were also found. One of the pièces found in the rubble was a fragment of an incense burner with an inscription indicating that Yax Pac, the 16th ruler in the local dynasty was ruler at Copán considerably later than expected. The dynastie history of Copán was studied by Linda Scheie (University of Texas at Austin), who is in charge of the préservation and consolidation of hieroglyphic inscriptions, and David Stuart (Princeton University), while Barbara Fash worked on new drawings of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and other hieroglyphic texts. Preliminary results of the epigraphic research on Copán monuments are published in the irregular ly issued "Copán Notes" (see Bibliography, mexicon X:l). Linda Scheie and Nikolai Grube found additional evidence that the reign of Yax Pac extends several years beyond the previous limit of 9.19.0.0.0 (A.D. 810). Furthermore, texts from Altar U and Stela 11 indícate that Yax Pac not only was son of a noblewoman from Palenque, but also had a brother who occupied a high position in the local hierarchy. Finally, Altar L in front of Stela 2 was discovered to be the accession monument of a ruler who succeeded Yax Pac in office. The date on this monument is the latest from the Copán Valley (9.19.11.14.5, February 10, A.D. 822), if the interprétation of the date by Scheie and Grube holds true. These new hieroglyphic finds correspond to the results of the Copán Valley Rural Sites Project directed by David Webster (Pennsylvania State University), which in its second and final seasonin 1986excavated27 structures ateight sites. Obsidian hydration studies by Ann Fréter (Pennsylvania State University) have produced more than 800 dates that reveal a démographie burst between A.D. 650 and 800 and indícate that a sizeable population remained in the valley for a Century or two after the collapse of the center. The 1988 season began in February with exploration work</page><page sequence="3">at Structure 16, which is being tunnelled. A freshly unearthed cache was found in front of this structure, at Altar Q. 1987 Archaeological activities in Yucatan MERIDA (A. Barrera Rubio/ mex). - EK BALAM. William M. Ringle and George Bey, Tulane University and Davidson College: Düring June and July 1987, the third field season at Ek Balam, previous investigations were resumed in order to learn more about the cultural history of the site, while at the same time a regional study of northeast Yucatan was begun which integrated data on Settlements, the environment, chro nology, demography, and political and economic Organiza tion. The mapping of the surroundings of the central part of the site was completed and some secondary sites in the periphery of Ek Balam were mapped. Stratigraphie pits were sunk into platforms and structures at the center as well as at some peripheral sites, and three cuts were made through the interior and exterior wall of the main site. In the laboratory ceramics and artifacts from the last season were analyzed and the material from the 1987 season was subjected to a prelimi nary classification.

Daniel Potter and Ch. E. Lincoln, Har vard University; topographer: Elena Kourembana, Univ. of California, Pura Cervera Rivero (UAY) for lithic industries: Preliminary research into lithic industries and seulement patterns was carried out at Xkichmook (or Xkichmool), about 52 km to the southeast of Oxkutzcab, near the border of Yucatán with Campeche. Two weeks of fieldwork in July 1987 were followed by another two of work in the laborato ry. Departing from the center of Xkichmook according to the map of Edward H. Thompson (Ruins of Xkichmook, Yuca tán. Field Columbian Museum Puhl. 28:209-232, Anthr. Series Vol. II, No. 3, Chicago 1898), radial transects were eut towards the four cardinal points in order to delimit the extent of the site. A stratigraphie pit was dug into one of the lithic Workshops at the site in order to get samples of the chromatic variation of the lithic material, to obtain a sequence of the tool production process, and to collect the associated ceramics for dating. At other sites peripheral to Xkichmook lithic surface material was collected for comparative purposes; these were the Ranchería de San Martin Hilil, San José Xtunil (where a lithic Workshop was located) and Ucmil. Anotherfield season is planned for 1988. - SAYIL PROJECT. Gair Tourtellot, University of New Mexico, and Jeremy A. Sabloff, University of Pittsburgh: Aftervarious field seasons (1983-1986) in which 3.5 km2 of Sayil have been mapped in detail and the limits of the known urban zone defined (with the exception of the south- ( east section of the site where settlement seems to continue as far as Xlapak and Labná), large-scale excavation of small structures and their open space were initiated in the 1987 season (June, July, and part of August). Horizontal excavations of small-scale buildings (structu res N7860-E5350 and N7824-E5389) should yield detailed information for the sociological analysis of the functions of the various types of structures and of the homes and their Organization, on the interrelationship of buildings, orienta tion and décoration of the façades, the relative status of each building, and additional information on the function or functions of multi-chambered stone buildings. A new field season began in February 1988. - SAYIL. Carlos Pérez Alvárez, Centro Regional de Yucatán, INAH: Architectural conservation. From the end of August to the beginning of November 1987, the "Brigada de Salvamento Arqueológico" was busy consolidating archaeological struc tures at Sayil. Above ail, work focused on the buildings ' known as the "Palace", the "Mirador", and section 3 of structure N7800-E54D (according to the University of New Mexico map) for the purpose of preserving the architecture. - KOM. Ricardo Velázquez Valadéz, Centro Regional de Yucatán, INAH: The "Salvage Brigade" of INAH's Centro Regional de Yucatán was busy from October to December 1987 in the archaeological zone of Kom, near Xul, Yucatán, with pro jects which entailed an outlay of about 5 million pesos. The "Brigada" consisted of more than a dozen experienced masons and workers from Oxkutzcab, assisted by four stu dents from the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán. Restoration work was carried out in Groups A and B at Kom (source: George F. Andrews, Informe de trabajo de campo, temporada 1984, vol. 2). In Group A Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4,6, and 7 of Structure 1 were wholly or partially Consolida ted, as was the façade.

The exca vation revealed the first as forming the base of a vaulted building and the second the base of a habitational platform. A third structure belongs to the site of Yakaxiu, which has the locationkey 16 Qd (10):24 (GarzaTarazona, S. andE. B. | Kurjack, Atlas Arqueológico de Yucatán, 1980). This was a habitational platform supporting the base of a residential unit. When the structure was excavated, the ceramics found sug gested a dating in the Late Classic. A metate grind-stone, a flint axe, and a conical machador were also unearthed. The data recovered confirmed the importance of salvage work, at the very least for such significant areas as the Puuc. The Oxkintok Project, 1987 MERIDA (R. Velázquez V.). From June to September 1987, the Spanish Archaeological Mission to Mexico conducted their second field season at the ruins of Oxkintok. Directed by Miguel Rivera Dorado, the project consisted of 13 investiga tors. While the first field season had been devoted primarily to the archaeological survey and mapping (see mexicon IX:5), the 1987 season saw not only a continuation of these efforts but also the first stratigraphie excavations and restoration , r™ , , ,. , .. ,, ,, ^ , Fig. 1.

An epigraphic investigation of the text will obviously shed more light on the significance of this striking figure, which probably represents an Early Classic Maya ruler. Veracruz: Preclassic Hieroglyphic Text Discovered NEW YORK (New York Times). A large stone slab with an extensive hieroglyphic inscription containing dates which refer to events that took place in A.D. 142 and A.D. 153 was found in November 1986 by a fisherman in the Acula River near the Gulf coast of Veracruz. The monument, weighing half a ton, not only contains the longest hieroglyphic text known from the Preclassic, but also shows a carved figure O O O GOO Fig. 1. Glyph from the Veracruz monument.
