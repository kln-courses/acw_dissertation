<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Our President Lilian G. Katz Misguided Intentions in Drug-Abuse Prevention I must admit I hadn't given much thought to drug-abuse prevention programs in schools until one of my grandsons brought home a newslet- ter distributed in his kindergarten. The newsletter for kindergartners is called "Smart Choices" and is pro- duced by DREAM, Inc.* The particu- lar issue that was brought to my at- tention by his disconcerted mother includes, among other things, a car- toon strip titled "Making Choices." Depicted in a sequence of four car- toon drawings are Ricky, a dark green anthropomorphic creature who looks like a slender Barney character, and a blond-haired little girl named Janet whom Ricky is accompanying home to play. The text says, "Ricky went to play at Janet's house. Janet's mother was asleep on the couch. Janet said her mom had been drinking too much beer. Janet thinks it's her [Janet's] fault." The cartoons show them en- tering the room, the mother asleep on the couch, Janet dismayed, and Ricky reassuring her. The reader (at kindergarten level) is then instructed to solve an alphabet code to find out who is at fault. The puzzle yields the answer: "Her mother is." This particular kindergartner (my grandson) had not yet actually seen a drunk person, and his mother was wondering how to help him make sense of the cartoon. His reaction to the "lesson" was a mixture of confu- sion and boredom. On the other hand, what if he were living in an area where such sights are commom? How would * Note: DREAM stands for Developing Re- sources for Education in AMerica, Inc., 817 East River Place, Jackson, MS 39202; 1-800-233-7326. this kind of "lesson" help?What steps would really help that child? It seems to me that the producers of "Smart Choices" newsletters are trying their best to provide pertinent and appealing material about social problems for kindergartners; how- ever, the real problem faced is one that cannot be dealt with this way! Young children need to be protected from the potential negative effects of drugs and alcohol, and all other dangers, by real, live adults. They need adults who al- ways know where the children are, whom they are with, and what they are doing at every waking hour. Young children also need commu- nities that do not tell them in school that something is dangerous and then tell them on television that they should be sure to consume it. If young children are growing up in the care of adults who have a hard time resist- ing drug abuse, how can we expect children not to abuse drugs on the basis of a few comics and puppets? Since my seeing the newsletter, I have learned that the proliferation of instructional materials with which to help young children develop resis- tance to drugs is in response to the 1986 Drug-Free Schools and Commu- nities Act, "implemented to help schools and communities establish comprehensive alcohol and drug- abuse education, prevention, and in- tervention programs geared toward children in kindergarten through 12th grades" (Blinn-Pike et al., 1993). Cer- tainly, schools should help children learn about the hazards of drug abuse, but at what age and by what means? Blinn-Pike et al. (1993) point out that "young children's attitudes to- ward the use or consumption of alco- hol and other drugs are formed prior to beginning school" (p. 152), and they suggest that drug education "must begin at younger and younger ages." Children growing up in environ- ments where the abuse of drugs and alcohol is all around them will cer- tainly have knowledge of and feel- ings about drug abuse, but what kind of drug education could influence pre- school and kindergarten children in these environments? Indeed, Blinn- Pike et al. report a case study of a seven-year-old girl who, on the post test following a "mentoring" program, 1. identified and discussed cocaine; 2. knew Coca Cola had caffeine in it; 3. knew prescription pills were drugs; 4. labeled and gave two nicknames for marijuana; and 5. knew beer, wine, and liquor can make you drunk and possibly result in being sent to jail for drunk driving. (1993, p. 163) What are the implications of this "suc- cessful" outcome of a mentoring pro- gram? This child is likely to continue to observe others who alleviate their deep sense of hopelessness by getting "high" on cocaine or other drugs, and alcohol. What kind of educational ap- proach would make sense? Can a few lessons at ages three, four, and five, with puppets or cartoons, really have a positive effect? Presumably we have cautioned the child about caffeine in soft drinks; but what about the TV and billboards that feature glamorous sports and pop music personalitites advertising caffeinated soft drinks? Blinn-Pike et al. also report that a seven-year-old girl 2 Young Children • March 1994</page><page sequence="2">. . . was only able to label the picture as beer and identify it as being bad. On the other hand, when asked about beer in the verbal interview she explained how it was used, that it was bad, and that it would get you drunk. In addition, she talked about four family members she had seen drink beer. (1993, p. 175) Might some children be learning to report to the school what they see as their parents' drug abuse? What will the schools do with these reports? What are the ethical implications of such discussion of family behavior for the teacher? So much for parent involvement and schools respecting children's backgrounds! What should early childhood edu- cators be doing about these prob- lems? Certainly, we should • assure that the development of any curriculum for young children be in- formed by expert knowledge of how young children learn; • keep an eye on the implementation of legislation that might impose such inappropriate activities on young children; • refer to specialist agencies those incidents that come to our attention that indicate clearly the hazards some of our young children are trying to deal with; and • honor our long-standing commit- ment to helping children to develop healthy minds and bodies, in gen- eral, and to providing children with meaningful experiences during the short time they are in our care. Teachers cannot single handedly change the high-risk environments some children are growing up in. Teachers, however, can put all of their knowledge and skills to work to make their hours together with chil- dren safe, warm, challenging, and satisfying ones. This, in itself, is a whole lot to accomplish and is one of the best contributions we can make to help children prepare for wise decisions in their future.
