<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nkanu and Mbeko Art and Ritua I ANNEMIEKE VAN DAMME-LINSEELE n 1990, I first traveled to Lower Congo (zone of Kimvula) to participate in the daily life of the Nkanu and their neighbors. It was my goal to study the use of "art" objects within their ritual framework.l Since there is little in the literature on this topic, it was necessary to investigate through fieldwork.2 When first I arrived, I felt great uncertainty about what I would find: How far had the cul- ture been modified by Western influences? I was encouraged by the inaccessibility of the area, and indeed my first contacts with Nkanu informants confirmed that they were still performing ancestral rites. How- ever, it also became clear that some of these rites had already been abandoned, while others were seldom practiced, and there were only a few specialists left who could give me information about them. Furthermore, although the Nkanu and their neighbors are very hospitable, it took me some time to win the confidence of their ritual experts. I had to convince them that I was not planning to institute a sim- ilar practice to theirs in Belgium. As a female researcher I had expected to meet with resistance or even hostility when I tried to study exclusively male matters, such as the initiation into man- hood known as nkanda. Sometimes this was the case. But helped by my inter- preter, Emile Mbandu Konda-who en- joyed a respected status because of his age and education-I obtained informa- tion about this ritual and the woodcarv- ings used in it. Those who were willing to reveal such information always took care to protect themselves with ritual gestures 1. Nkisi mpungu statue collected by A. M. Van Damme-Linseele in 1991 for the Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren (Belgium), R.G. 91.21.5. 39cm x 22cm (15Y16" x 8'8"). autumn 2004 ? alrican arts against the misfortune (i.e., infertility) this revelation could cause. Fortunately, they also believed that, although certain kinds of information could not be revealed to un- initiated persons within their own group, it was not harmful to Westerners. Nkanu and Mbeko Spirits Nkanu and Mbeko ritual and ritual objects are impossible to understand without an understanding of their spirit world. At the top of their pantheon stands Nzambi, the remote god or Supreme Spirit. The Nkanu and Mbeko categorize spirit types as the bakulu, the bankita, the bisimbi, and the matebo. The bakulu are deceased dan mem- bers awaiting reincarnation, who experi- ence a liminal existence in a realm known as the Mpemba world,3 whence they may make occasional appearances in a variety of forms in the land of the living. The other three categories are types of natural forces. The bankita and the bisimbi are peaceful forces living in or near rivers, in the savan- na, or on places of landslide, whereas the malicious matebo dwell in the woods. In addition to these forces of nature are spirits of the original ancestors, Mbaka (a dwarfish people) and Nsamba (a white- skinned people). Still other impersonal forces can be grouped under the name of minkisi (sg. nkisi). The Nkanu and Mbeko appear to make a distinction between the minkisi they borrowed from their neigh- bors the Yaka (such as nkanda, mbwolo, ngombo, nkosi) and those they inherited from their Kongo ancestors (such as mpun- gu, nkita, niangi). The Nkanu and Mbeko do not see sickness or death as having natural caus- es, but rather seek their sources in witch- craft (kindoki) or in the presence of an nkisi that took possession of the patient. A per- son can place his belongings under the protection of an nkisi. When another indi- vidual touches or takes away such an object unlawfully, the nkisi will attack the thief or a member of his family.4 Consult- ing a diviner, or nganga ngombo, will dis- close the identity of the nkisi responsible for the disease. This specialist can make the nkisi "talk" so that it will reveal the reason for its presence. In Nkanu and Mbeko society there are specialists who are capable of "captur- ing" the force of an nkisi, dominating it, and introducing it into an object: a sculp- ture, a utilitarian object, or an amalgam of elements. This container then is identified with the nkisi itself (Fig. 1). Some say that. it was Nzambi-others that it was Ma- hungu or Ngu, a sort of androgynous pri- mary being-who gave humans the use of minkisi to provide for protection or the fulfillment of wishes. One such important nkisi, which in- spires the carving of "art" objects, is the nkisi nkanda. The word nkanda has various meanings. First of all, it can be translated as the force that is responsible for health problems such as infertility and sterility. The Nkanu and Mbeko consider these to be the worst problems an individual can encounter; barren individuals are not seen as able-bodied members of the com- munity. Nkanda also stands for a collective initiation ritual, which the Nkanu and Mbeko claim to have borrowed from the Yaka.5 An nkanda session is seen as a pre- ventive treatment to assure the procre- ativity of men and thus the continuity of the society. It is an exclusively male mat- ter and starts with the circumcision of the neophytes, young males between six and eighteen years of age (Fig. 2). After the operation, the neophytes are gathered within an enclosure in the forest. This seclusion area-wherein they must stay for several months, in former times some- 13 z 0 I o U i lr</page><page sequence="2"></page><page sequence="3">times for one to three years-is also known as "nkanda" or "kimpasi ki nkanda."6 During the period of isolation they are instructed in techniques of agriculture, fish- ing, hunting, weaving, and so on. Nkanda songs and dances are taught to them as well as an esoteric vocabulary, dictated by the nkisi nkanda itself. Elder initiated men also instruct them in moral precepts and beliefs. The nkanda is the preeminent frame- work for the use of several minkisi (here in the sense of objects containing a super- natural force). Statues, initiation panels, masks, and cephalomorphic poles protect the well-being of the neophytes and guar- antee the good progress of the initiation. The ritual objects (minkisi) made for the nkanda initiation have significant for- mal differences in terms of the size of the statues, the kinds of wood the carvers use, and the presence or absence of poly- chrome, from those meant for other heal- ing practices and for divination. The nkanda objects are rather tall, are carved from the wood of the kingela tree (Ricinodendron heudelotti var. Africanum), and are rich- ly adorned with various colors,7 whereas other ritual statues are small, made out of species whose wood is tougher and den- ser, and are monochrome, or at the most colored with red or white dashes or spots. Some of these formal differences arise from the fact that the objects in these different categories have been made by different groups of artists; sometimes, however, the explanation must be sought in the tradi- tional formal prescriptions for nkanda ver- sus non-nkanda sculptures.8 Sacred and profane sculptors In Nkanu and Mbeko society, there are some carvers of non-nkanda objects (such as cephalomorphic slit drums and small ritual statues) who are themselves healers and diviners (Fig. 3). They may make the ritual objects they need for their practice, but more often order them from profes- sional sculptors. There are also profession- This page: 2.

VA1 14</page><page sequence="4">al carvers known as banganga baluvumbu (Nkanu) or banganga binkudimba (Mbeko) who are healers specializing in the treat- ment of nkisi nkanda afflictions. An nganga luvumbu sculpts the objects (masks, initi- ation panels, statues, poles; Figs. 4 and 5) used in the nkanda, but he is primarily a healer (nganga buka) of fertility problems, treating circumcised boys who are unable to have an erection.9 The nganga luvumbu is also a dreaded sorcerer who employs his power to harm people.10 When there is not an nkanda session going on, he usual- ly accepts commissions to create all sorts of woodwork. Thus, within Nkanu and Mbeko society, there are healers and di- viners, and there are carvers, and there are some individuals who, by personal choice, are both. However, an nganga luvumbu must, by definition, be both a healer and a sculptor. It is rather an exception to the rule that an individual chooses to become an ngan- ga luvumbu; usually he is "chosen" by an ancestor or an elder. The person becomes ill, loses blood, and the diviner treating his problem reveals that a deceased member of the family, himself an nganga luvumbu, wants a successor and thus seeks to as- sure the continuity of the function with- in the family. In contrast, an individual can choose to become a simple sculptor of his own accord, driven by the impulse to create objects out of wood. He then ap- prentices himself to a master carver who can teach him this handicraft. According to an Nkanu informant, Nsi- abula Malungidi, the job of nganga luvum- bu is a rather lucrative occupation. When at work, he can command the nkanda initi- ate to do all sorts of little jobs for him, such as fetching water or cultivating his fields. The job of a simple woodcarver is less profitable. He can seldom devote himself autumn 2004 ? atrican arts 15</page><page sequence="5">This page: 5.

Just like his fellow villagers, to meet his daily needs he has to do agricultural labor, hunt, and/or combine carving with another craft, such as blacksmithing. For his creative work the nganga lu- vumbu prefers the isolation of the woods. When he and fellow specialists are invit- ed to make the ritual objects needed for an nkanda session in progress (Fig. 6), they can settle within the enclosure, but more often they choose to work in total silence in a dwelling constructed for them in the neighborhood of this ritual place (Fig. 7). When at work, these specialist carvers have to respect certain rules. Because there are certain powers involved to complete this job successfully, sexual abstinence is pref- erable before and during the period need- ed to finish the carving. The sculptor of non-nkanda objects, in contrast, remains in the village. The villagers are used to seeing him at work. He has no special rules he must obey. Batata Mutombo told me, how- ever, that he always makes sure that there are no women or children in the neighbor- hood who can distract him. He added that in former times, sculptors had to withdraw to the savanna, where they had special con- tact with the ancestors. During my fieldwork, I also investigat- ed the social position of Nkanu and Mbeko sculptors and the attitude of the villagers towards them. Something can already be deduced from the fact that the Nkanu and Mbeko use the words bumbangu and bum- fusi, both translated to me as "craftsman- ship," to describe the creative process by which nkanda as well as non-nkanda objects are created. A carver in these societies is thus seen as a craftsman. It is difficult to determine what place these creative specialists enjoy within the traditional societies I studied. Some of the woodcarvers I met are persons of high social status; for instance, the late Kiala Funga Nzombo was chefde groupement11 of Kimbuba and head of the Kikiangu clan. Still others combine their profession with a job as a healer (nganga buka) or black- smith, professions that of themselves com- pel a certain respect. The individual cases of professional woodcarvers who make non-nkanda art, of banganga baluvumbu, alrican arts * autumn 2004 16</page><page sequence="6">and of individuals who combine both roles give some idea of the range of their experience. FranCois Kitaia At Kimpaka (Kipaolo) I met with an Mbeko sculptor, Franqois Kitaia (Fig. 8), who was born in 1929 and grew up in the adjacent village of Kizulukulu. His moth- er, Kinkisi ki Luvwalu Kikweta, belonged to the Kimbenza Makuku ma Ntinu fam- ily; his father, Neni Nsangu, was of the Kiblungu clan. He received his personal name, Kitaia, from a member of the fam- ily who came to collect a part of his moth- er's dowry at the moment her first baby was bor. He had to be content with so little that he named the baby "Kitaia" after a bad-smelling plant. Observing the famous sculptors Luyani and Nsebanil2 at work, Kitaia dreamt of becoming a pro- fessional carver and tried to make one piece after another. In Kinshasa he met with nka Malongo, a mulari,13 with whom he collaborated from 1947 until he returned for good to his native village in 1959. Kitaia prefers to make objects in "black wood" (bois noir, with such vernacular names as mbwengi, ngonti, n'si nkosi and n'koso). He carves little statues, slit drums, handles for flywhisks, pipes, and mortars. After he has shaped the objects, he rubs them in with the root of the kingondi plant. This gives the wooden pieces an ocher- ous tint that, after some time, turns red brown. Kitaia is not an nganga, so "trans- forming" objects into ritual pieces has to be done afterward by the clients them- selves or by another specialist. His tools consist of a small knife, a chis- el, and a little ax. The metal parts of these tools were made by a blacksmith; the han- dles he made himself. He usually works near his dwelling. It does not bother him if the villagers watch while he is working. The villagers, too, are used to seeing him at work. He says that there are no particu- lar rules governing his work, except for the fact that he never works on Sundays. He considers himself semi-modern: If he does not like the way a sculpture is turn- ing out or if the wood splits, he simply throws it away. Traditional carvers would regard their wood splitting as evidence of malignant spirits and would be careful to ritually burn or bury an abandoned sculpture; to simply throw it away would be to risk nightmares and illness. The price he charges for a statue depends on the dimensions of the object and on the client he made it for: a friend, a member of the family, a villager, or a merchant from Kinshasa in search of art objects. Kitaia carved little mbwolo figurines for thefutu di ngombo14 of the Kisengele fam- ily (Fig. 9). The Mbeko and Nkanu be- lieve that the nkisi mbwolo often attracts the nkisi ngombo nkoko, so it is common to find mbwolo statues in the bag of a divin- er. These little figurines are used to treat patients with ailments such as rheuma- tism, severe headaches, tooth pain, or apa- thy. Typical of Mbeko art, these objects have beards and headdresses ending in one large braid in the back of the neck of the sculpted figure. Nsiabula Malungidi Western collectors have usually regarded traditional African art objects as the prod- ucts of anonymous makers and until re- cently were not interested in noting down the names of those who carved the pieces they gathered for museums or private col- lections. Even within the local community, such products are seen as tools to manip- ulate the spirit world, not as "art"; for them it is efficacy that counts, not who made them. What did surprise me, as I conduct- ed my fieldwork, was the fact that many of the men and women I interviewed about nkanda initiation could recall the names of banganga baluvumbu who were active at the beginning of the twentieth century. In the context of nkanda initiation, it appears that carvers are less anonymous. This goes with the fact that it is the parents, in consultation with the organizers of the nkanda initiation session, who decide which banganga will be invited to make the objects necessary for the initiation and who will treat their chil- dren. It is therefore the best-known special- ists, renowned because of their knowledge as healers and / or sculptors, who take part in nkanda sessions. Nsiabula Malungidi is an nkanda spe- cialist and does not accept any other commissions. I visited him at Kisanguna II (Kimasofi), a small village near the Con- golese border with Angola. He is a mem- ber of the Simu Nzadi clan. At birth he received the name Malungidi. One day his autumn 2004 ? atrican arts paternal uncle Kinavwidi looked him up to tell him he had to join the nkanda camp at Kimatungu, an Nkanu village in north- ern Angola. There he got his nkanda name "Nsiabula." At the end of the initiation, he took the sobriquet "Kagena mfumu ko," which means, "There is no chief." This name was taken to chastise the organiz- ers of the nkanda because there were insuf- ficient funds to arrange a copious feast at the close of the initiation session. Nsiabula Malungidi did not acquire his calling as the result of being struck by any illness. It was the wish of his father, nka Kilengu-himself an nkanda specialist- that his son became a circumciser or ngan- ga kitapa, so he sent him to his own father, nka Nzama of Bembele (nganga kitapa and nganga luvumbu). In 1953 Nsiabula assisted nka Nzama in the nkanda of Bembele and there circumcised his first neophyte. As a youngster he loved to make stat- ues in wood, so he showed interest in carving nkanda objects (masks, poles, ini- tiation panels, statues) as well. Nka Nzama imparted the skills of an nganga luvumbu to him. When I asked whether he wished the same profession for his own sons, he replied that they are twins; the tradition forbids bana ba nlongo (literally "children of the interdiction": twins, albinos, and the physically handicapped) to practice as banganga. Since there was no nkanda taking place during my visit, I could not see Nsiabula Malungidi at work. Nevertheless, I was able to study some of the objects he made for a previous nkanda session. At Kisoma I saw three masks that had been made by Nsiabula Malungidi with the assistance of Marcel Kahuma of Kisoma. These masks had been used in the nkanda of Kingala (northern Angola) in 1976. 17</page><page sequence="7">In Figure 10 we see Nsiabula Malungidi (right) with three masks at his feet: Kiso- kolo, Nkoso, and Makemba. Unlike the other mask types, the Nkoso mask (Fig. 12) is present at the beginning of the nkan- da initiation. It is thus the only mask type that is not carved but plaited. A lukongolo liana formed into a circular shape rein- forces the bottom of the cap. A collar made of raffia is tied to the cap and the liana. In the openings of the plaited material, feath- ers of wild birds15 are fastened with resin. The eyes and the mouth of the mask are made from the stems of small gourds. Little holes are placed under the "eyes" so that the masked dancer can see during the performance. I was told that in the west- ern part of the Nkanu region, the Nkoso mask can be fashioned in wood, in the form of a human face, crowned with the same feather tuft. I could not find an ex- ample of this wooden variant in the field, nor in Western collections. The Kisokolo mask (Fig. 11) is an ex- ample of the mask type of the Angolan 18 Nkanu. A typical element of this regional form is the shieldlike panel with rounded comers, upon which the face is carved in relief in the middle.16 The characteristics of the Kisokolo mask are a white face, a nose with elongated top, two hornlike projec- tions from the top of the head, and a strip of spotted feline hide between the two "horns".17 This example has been decorat- ed with the traditional signs of beauty: the line on the forehead and the crosses on the cheeks are tattoos, the chipped upper teeth represent dental mutilation. My informants called the mask at the far right of Figure 10 (also Fig. 13) "Mbau"18 but I want to identify it as a Makemba mask (in comparison with other Nkanu masks). Here again, like the Kisokolo mask, this type has been designed as a sort of panel with a human face in relief in the middle of it. The mask displays facial dec- oration or tattoo-marks: "tears" on the cheeks and a line running over the fore- head. These wooden masks are semi-hel- met masks, with a wooden "face" and a This page: 7. Small wooden panel with the representation of a (redtail) parrot (nkusu). 43.8cm x 31.3cm (171/4'x125/16").

The basic form is very different from that of the more popular masks of the neighboring Yaka peoples. Yaka masks are supplied with a projec- tion from the chin that serves as a grip (hidden under the bulky raffia collar); such a handle is absent from Nkanu and Mbeko masks. Nsiabula Malundigi used the wood of the kingela tree to carve these last two mask types. In fact, as a rule, all sculp- tured nkanda objects have to be cut in this kind of wood, which has a low density, so it is easy to cut, and is also relatively insect resistant. The kingela tree found in the savanna is fast-growing and is therefore a symbol of fertility for the Nkanu. The substances Nsiabula Malungidi used for coloring the masks are kaolin (mpemba), ndimba, and imported wash blue (bule). In contrast with the white kaolin clay, ndimba cannot be found as such in nature: clumps of black river clay (kala tuma) are burned in an open fire until they turn red. After pounding them in a mor- tar, one obtains a red powder, ndimba. The color black is produced from the carbon- ized roots of manioc. The sculptor mixes the pigment with resin (ngondokulu) and a dash of palm wine. The last ingredient is to give the dried paint a shiny look, the sculp- tors told me. Paint brushes are made of the stems of the kitundibila plant, chewed at one end, as well as chicken feathers. Nsiabula Malungidi also showed me other sculptures he made for the nkisi nkanda and related minkisi. I filmed him while he was treating a woman with fer- tility problems provoked by the nkisi nluwa ki mbele. Later he would install a sort of altar-a cluster of sticks (makala, sg. (di)kala)-into the house of this pa- tient. To give me an idea of such altars, Nsiabula Malungidi took me to neigh- boring villages and showed me dwell- alrican arts ? autumn 2004</page><page sequence="8">made of bamboo, which symbolizes the circumciser. Such an altar may never be removed from the dwelling where it is installed, even after there is proof that the remedy has been successful. Instead, the sticks must rot or be eaten away by insects. When the patient moves from the house, the altar remains and falls into decay, together with the house. If the healer considers it nec- essary, another altar will be installed in the new residence of the patient. Batata Mutombo Batata Mutombo, bor around 1940, lives in Kimabaka. He told me that he fell ill some thirty years ago with some type of back problem. The diviner he consulted about the matter diagnosed his ailment as kambinza or kaselu wa nkanda, which seems to be a hereditary disease. His pa- teral grandfather was an nganga buka for the treatment of the nkisi nkanda. They consulted him and he treated Batata Mu- tombo by initiating him as healer and sculptor. As a compensation for this ser- vice, Batata Mutombo gave him a cock, a bottle of palm wine, and some cola nuts. He added that he had to be initiated be- fore anyone could teach him how to carve, otherwise he would have lost a lot of blood when urinating. He learned this handicraft by obser- vation. He watched when his grandfather made statues for the boys' initiation. Ac- cording to him, he managed to master the skills of a sculptor in only three weeks: ings where he had been active as a heal- er, describing the course of the disease of his patients. At Kisanguna Kowa II we entered the house of Mfutila. After the death of her husband, tradition demanded that she marry one of his brothers, but she refused to do so and accepted the proposal of another man. The relatives of her depart- ed husband accused her of adultery. She gave birth to only one child and further pregnancies were not forthcoming, so she consulted a diviner. The nganga ngombo revealed that family of her former hus- band had used supernatural powers (the minkisi longo and nkita) to block her fertil- ity, so she called on Nsiabula Malungidi for treatment. At the end of the healing process, this specialist erected in her house three makala with a kala di luvumbu on the left, with a sculptured face, a raffia col- lar, and a great cross incised in the lower part of the stick (Fig. 14). The kala di lu- vumbu represents, in fact, Kisokolo. Some makala of this type exhibit all the char- acteristics of the Kisokolo mask-the elon- gated nose, the horns, the hide on the top-while others, such as this example, show only a few of these formal elements. The red pole is the kala di kitapa, also known as kala nsiabula. The two other sticks are said to be "the children" (bana). Nsiabula Malungidi told me that he al- ways uses nyombo wood to sculpture the kala di luvumbu. The kala di kitapa is made of a stake of n'sasa wood. With a knife, he provides the stake with indentations; these are his eyes and mouth. These notch- es are filled up with white clay, "to open up the eyes and mouth, so that the force within can watch over the patient." Around the base of the pole Nsiabula Malungidi rolls a braid of grass that holds a "knife" autumn 2004 ? atrican arts 19</page><page sequence="9">20 -?

These peoples believe that its force can realize all their wishes, beneficial as well as harmful to their fellow man. As a ritual object, the nkisi mpungu can take different forms. The basic form is a ring- shaped cushion of vegetable materials, a little gourd, an Achatina shell, or a wood- en figurine. The biteke bimpungu (mpungu statues) carved by Batata Mutombo (Fig. 15) have fragments of a mirror fixed on their bellies to lock the little cavity contain- ing magical ingredients. To activate the force within the power object, one needs between one and five blades of grass, a cola nut, and some nsamba-palm wine. The blades of grass are tied around the object and the mixture of chewed nut and palm wine spat on the knots in the grass or on the object itself at the niche where the mag- ical ingredients have been inserted. Batata Mutombo also carved, in my presence, an mpungu figurine called Kokoto, difua kanda, nga mbimbi, mpungu nga mbimbi ("Stag bee- tle, dead as the skin of a mbimbi-snake, mpungu as mbimbi"; Fig. 16). He prefers to make non-nkanda objects out of the wood of the ngonti tree (literally "leopard tree"); it does not split, is easy to cut, and the ancestors "prescribed" the use of it. Other species he uses are nsasa and yombo. Batata Mutombo himself al- ways chooses which tree to cut, because he already has in mind an image of the fig- urine he will make out of it and thus seeks a tree with the right dimensions. When he has found one, he addresses himself to the ancestors. He takes a cola nut, breaks it into little particles, and throws thefn in different directions with the words: Matondo! Makasu ku beno bankaka. Nti yu mfunu yi mvuidi kisalu yi sadila wu. Lungana mpeve yi mbote, mukusa nde kisalu kitoma. Thank you! Cola nuts for you ancestors. This tree I need for the work I'll do with it. Give me a good spirit, So the work I do will be appreciated. Fresh-cut wood blocks have to rest at least three days before they can be used to make a statue. He always has a stock of wood pieces stored against the outside back wall of his dwelling. The protruding eaves protect them against rain; inside the house, the wood would dry too quickly, split, and turn black from the smoke. Before he starts carving, he marks his tools with kaolin to ward off injuries and sick- ness. In the session that I photographed, he needed 3 hours and 44 minutes (with 21</page><page sequence="11">breaks) to finish the sculpture. (In normal conditions he usually plans three days to carve a similar piece). Before rubbing the statue with a mix- ture of oil and ndimba and before inserting magical ingredients into the cavity in its belly to lend it his power, Batata Mutombo put on a headband (kibanda) and painted his face (Fig. 17). The materials he took out of hisfutu and put in the niche in the form of hairs, powder, or scrapings were enu- merated to me: a head of a snake, a tooth of a crocodile, an eye tooth of a leopard, a piece of bone of a lion, a piece of hide of a mfuki cat and of a lunsokosoko rat, the foot of a guinea fowl, roots of an nkonki and ndolondolo tree, an ngunda leaf, a piece of bark of the poisonous nkasa tree, a mvumbu and ntondi toadstool, a particle copal (kala nzasi, literally "stone of the lightning"), and some cola nuts. He took one cola nut, chewed it, and blew the mixture successively on the gas- tric region, the back, the left and right shoulder, and the forehead of the figurine. Then he rubbed the figurine's feet. When I asked him about the meaning of these acts, he referred to the treatment of the nkanda neophytes by the nganga luvumbu to give them strength or to heal them. Nka Basola, who commissioned the mpungu statue, joined us during the work. He gave me evidence of what an important sculptor Batata Mutombo is: He testified how he had seen one of his statues, newly carved, running away from the village to the savanna. He add- ed that some mpungu figurines contain special powers and enable the owner to fly to Kinshasa without touching the ground once. When Batata Mutombo completed the job, I asked him if he was pleased with the result. "Yes," he said, and when I sound- ed him upon his criteria of judgment he replied that the formal qualities corre- 22 sponded with the traditional standards: "The ancestors gave it this form." Marcel Kahuma Another Nkanu specialist that I observed at work was Marcel Kahuma of the Kigaba di Kongo family. I met with him at his home village of Kisoma. He combines the func- tion of healer (nganga luvumbu) with that of carver of nkanda and non-nkanda objects. Marcel Kahuma is known within almost the entire Nkanu region as a skillful carver. Some healers and diviners even testified they prefer power objects sculpted by him. It seems that his works are valued higher than those of Batata Mutombo of Kimabaka. Marcel Kahuma told me how he was struck by an illness, locally known as lu- banzi (with symptoms such as pains in the ribs). Consultation with a diviner revealed that his deceased grandfather nkaka Vwa- nda-who was both a circumciser (nganga kitapa)19 and an nganga luvumbu-had cho- sen him to be his successor. After he was initiated in 1960, in the neighborhood of his home village, he was trained by nka Zefu Nsitumana of Kizenda (Angola), who combined both functions too. Kahuma accompanied him in 1967 to Kinsuni, an Nkanu village in the north of Angola. Nka Nsitumana taught him to handle the cir- cumcision knife and ordered him to finish the circumcision of the young candidates by giving a second cut into the foreskin. Driven by the nkanda force, Kahuma then jumped onto the roof of the nzo nkanda (nkanda dwelling). Thereafter, he accompa- nied nka Nzefu to still other circumcision rituals. The skill of carving he achieved by observation and by practice. When an nkanda session is organized in the north of Angola, he is always invited to be both cir- cumciser and nganga luvumbu. At a later date Kahuma showed me masks he had made himself; they includ- This page: Left: 16. Batata Mutombo at work. He is finishing off an mpungu statue. Kimvula, June 10, 1990.

The base itself has no features other than eye slits so that the wearer can see. Makemba is usually represented as a preg- nant woman in labor or a mother with one child or with twins. Other mask types, such as Ndele, Mangombo, and Kinene, are elaborated as doll-like figurines on top of a trapezoidal piece of wood. The Ndele mask is a representation of a white man. Kahuma, with an eye for little details, gave him a Western outfit: a white T-shirt with a badge, trousers, and a baseball cap on the head. The other newly carved masks that he showed me represent animals: the hippopotamus (Ngufu) and the ga- zelle (Nsiesi). A typical feature of Nkanu masks is the bulging cap that surmounts the wooden part. This cap is always orna- mented with designs (geometric, zoomor- phic, and anthropomorphic) in variegated colors similar to those found on initiation panels (Fig. 19). At the entrance of the nkanda enclo- sure, in which the circumcised boys must remain a certain time, always stand two statues, one male and one female (Fig. 18). The nganga luvumbu carves them and the nganga kisidika20 installs them. Accord- ing to Marcel Kahuma these nude figures represent the candidates' parents, who have to be on guard at the entrance of the initiation camp so that their children and their initiation cannot be disturbed by malevolent forces. As already mentioned, banganga balu- vumbu may do all sorts of woodwork for the villagers when an nkanda ritual is not going on or in preparation. They usually work to order. I observed Marcel Kahuma making two slit drums. A slit drum (nkoko ngombo) consists of a cylindrical "torso" surmounted by a small human head. The entire object is carved out of one piece of atrican arts ? autumn 2004</page><page sequence="12">wood. The "torso" is hollowed out so that it forms an idiophone that can be played by beating the cylinder with a round stick. In so doing, the diviner (nganga ngombo) announces his or her presence. The cavity can also be used to prepare medicinal potions for the client to drink. During a divination session, the specialist sits upon this instrument. This particular set of slit drums forms a couple. The form of the hat or headdress can distinguish the gender. I followed the whole production pro- cess of these slit drums; the time needed to carve them was 3 hours and 9 minutes. Marcel Kahuma's daughter Nsembo (her ngombo-name), who had been initiated as a diviner, finished them off by dying them with a mixture of oil, ndimba, the blood of a hen, a malekansanga string, some scrapings of the kigeta and mbota trees, and nine leaves from the bottom of a river. She rubbed the face of the "female" drum with kaolin and added a string of malekansanga herb around the necks of both statues. Inside her father's house she raised the nkisi ngombo (a process I recorded on video) to give the instruments the force they will need. The Nkanu and Mkebo use figurative objects principally in the contexts of heal- ing, fortune telling, and the initiation of boys. It is regrettable that the nkanda insti- tution has almost disappeared in the Con- golese habitat of the Nkanu and Mbeko, since it was the most fruitful context for "art" production. And there is a real chance that with the passing of the cre- ative specialists I saw at work, traditional carving will disappear for good, since I did not meet any young people who were interested in training in the profession of sculptor or of nganga luvumbu. Perhaps the ancestors will intervene in time and call upon the youth among their relatives to continue or to reintroduce their tradi- tional crafts. U Notes, page 90 autumn 2004 ? atrican arts</page><page sequence="13">notes VAN DAMME-LINSEELE: Notes, from page 23 [This article was accepted for publication in January 2002.] 1. Fieldwork for my Ph.D. thesis was carried out in 1990 and 1991 among the Nkanu, Mbeko, and Lula in the zone of Kimvula (Democratic Republic of Congo). This research was possible thanks to the grants of Fondation Dapper, Paris, and of the Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren. I am deeply grateful to all the Nkanu and Mbeko who agreed to furnish me information on their traditions and I am equally indebted to Emile Mbandu Konda, munkanu, who assisted me in the field as my interpreter and true friend. Also a word of gratitude goes to Dr. D. Binkley for his kindness in reading and commenting on my text. 2. This is rather remarkable when we consider the large num- ber of published works on the culture of the neighbors of the Nkanu. I specifically think of the Yaka, the Teke, and the Kongo of the left bank of the Inkisi River. It should also be noted that works made by Nkanu sculptors are found in Western museums and private collections but some of these are misattributed because of incorrect or incomplete data about their place of origin. In museums where they have been stored since the beginning of the twentieth century, they were often labeled only as "Kwango." This may refer to the stream at some distance from the Nkanu region or to the Kwango district, but it is more probable that it stands for the Kwango Mission founded by Father Henxthoven in 1893, because we are indebted to the Jesuits for the presence of the greater part of the Nkanu objects in Western museums. For a long time, the Nkanu and other eastern Kongo peoples were considered to be part of the rebellious Yaka people (the neighbors of the Nkanu on the right bank of the Kwango). More recently, this information has been in part rectified by ascribing many of the objects to the Nkanu, while others are still mislabeled, even though stylistic characteristics point to an Nkanu origin. 3. Mpemba is the Kikongo word for "kaolin" and for "white," the color that is linked to death, to human bones, and to the ancestors. 4. The nkisi does not necessarily render a member of the family ill immediately; it can take several generations to manifest itself. The mpongo then perceives a latent presence within the family. During the ngombo initiation rite at Kikolokolo that I attended (July 18-20,1991), the nkisi declared, through the mouth of the person who entered in a trance (ntu nkisi), that it had been intro- duced into the family "mu ngulu, mu mpumbu ngani," "by the pig, by the slave of someone else." It thus became clear that the theft of a pig and inflictions on a slave by an ancestor of the family attracted this mpongo. 5. The nkanda ritual is known, under this name or some phonet- ic variant, by many other ethnic peoples. The area of distribution of this rite is, according to Mudiji-Malamba (1989:55, n. 67), enclosed by the Kwango (W), the Kasai (E), and the Upper Zambezi (S). This terrain is the habitat of the Ndembu, Tshokwe, Yaka, Lunda, Lwena, and Mbala. In a footnote, the same author adds, "This area descends further towards southern Africa and ascends very high in the axis of the Lower Congo, Rep. of Congo, Gabon, etc." (Cette aire descend plus bas vers l'Afrique aus- trale et monte plus haut dans l'axe Bas-Zaire, Rep. du Congo, Gabon, etc.) None of the peoples practicing this tradition claim to have created this institution. On the contrary, they always refer to their neighbors, from whom they borrowed it. 6. In literature kimpasi normally is translated as "the place of suffering (mpasi)." I, however, want to endorse the etymolog- ical explanation by the Belgian father Fr. Bontinck (personal communication) as "the dwelling place (ki-) of the spirits (mp(u)asi, (e)mbasi)." 7. Nkanu objects used within the nkanda are usually abundant- ly painted, a striking aspect that also characterizes the art of their eastern neighbors, the Yaka. This has contributed to the confusion in attributing the artistic productions of both peoples. 8. There seems to be a specific term-mbawa or mbau-for the first category, while nkisi or kiteke are general terms for the other sculptural works. 9. Luvumbu is, for that matter, a derivation of the verb kuvumbu- la, "to erect." His mission is illustrated in the statement, "Nganga luvumbu ukuvumbula, ukuga lunkonso, ukuga lungola"; "The ngan- ga luvumbu raised you, he has given you the force to procreate, he has given you the power." And further, "Kitapa katapa, luvumbu kavumbula," or, "the circumciser cuts, the one who raises, raises." 10. Domingiele Mvwaka of Kingemba-Kinga told me that his paternal uncle worked as an nganga luvumbu at the nkanda at Kimaganga. When the organizers forgot to invite him for the closing ceremony he was so incensed that he threatened to ren- der infertile the leaders among the initiates. One of the boys did indeed die childless. When an nganga wants to make a person barren, he takes a needle, breaks it, and at the same time utters the name of his victim. Repairing clothes with the needle of a nganga luvumbu can also lead to similar problems. 11. The colonial authorities appointed medaled chiefs at the head of different villages. The administrative and political entity they installed in that way is known as a groupement. 12. Luyani and Nsebani were two famous banganga baluvumbu of the Nkanu, living in the early twentieth century. In the con- tribution I wrote for the colloquium "Ni anonyme, ni imper- sonnel," organized by Arts d'Afrique Noire, I discuss the life 90 and the career of Nsebani of Kipindi in detail. I assume that this nganga has been responsible for many of carvings that are now in Western collections. 13. A mulari is a person of the Lari people, a subdivision of the well-known Teke people. 14. Afutu is a bag containing all the paraphernalia a healer or a diviner needs for his practice. 15. The feathers of the following wild birds are used for this purpose: mbudi nkoko (turaco), mbulu komba (?), ngumbi-ngumbi (black stork), mbanzia (sparrowhawk), nduwa (redtail parrot), mbemba (fishing eagle), nkelele (guinea fowl) and nkanga (quail). 16. This stylistic form seems to be typical for the masks found in the southeast of the Congolese Nkanu region (and proba- bly also in their habitat in the north of Angola). 17. Several Central African peoples produce similar masks, with two projections on top of it. According to M. L. Bastin (1994:28, fig. 9; 34, Fig. 13) this aspect refers to the headdresses of chiefs of the ancient kingdoms Angola and Matamba. Today Yaka and Luwa chiefs have similar headwear. The relation between the chief and the buffalo has been demonstrated by Bourgeois (1991:19-32). As to the Kisokolo mask, Nsiabula Malungidi stated that, "In fact these projections are not horns, they 'replace' the arms of the dancer extended above his head to express his joy, as the real limbs go concealed under the long raffia collar of the mask." 18. I collected the name "Mbau" for this mask. I learned how- ever that mbau or mbawa is not a name of a particular type of mask. It simply means "mask" or "ritual object." 19. Kitapa (or ki(n)taba) is a derivation of the verb kutapa, "to cut". A synonym is nsiabula, a word from the Yaka or Luwa dialect, also used by the eastern Nkanu. 20. Kisidika is a derivation of the verb kusidika, which means "to protect". References cited Bastin, M. L. 1994. Sculpture Angolaise: Memorial de cultures. Lisbon: Museu Nacional de Etnologia.

PAPINI: Notes, from page 61 [This article was accepted for publication in February 2002.] 1. According to Pretorius and Jafta's new typology of south- ern African Zionism (1997:219-20), the subset of "Zion City" churches comprises the large-scale incorporative movements which Sundkler (1961, 1976) characterized as typifying the Zulu language-area-perhaps because typically they nucleat- ed around charismatic "prophet kings" who had managed to acquire lands and build theocratic centers where productive relations among the faithful were reorganized to form viable collective estates (Comaroff 1985:256). The great majority in "Zulu Zion" today, it should be noted, belong to the more numerous and evanescent city-based "small band" or house congregations, the "Zion-Apostolics." 2. For this male ensemble of sun-helmet, kilt, and boots, known as "the Scotch"-the only "non-African" holy dance uniform worn throughout the year, except on the Church's January pil- grimage to its holy mountain-see Papini 2002. 3. The surplice, with slightly different male and female versions, is named for the Shembe creed UbuNazaretha ("Nazaritehood"), a version of the ascetic vow of Yahweh's militant warrior elite in the struggle against Canaanism detailed in Numbers 6. 4. "IsiZulu" is the term applied to not only the language, but also anything "in the Zulu way." Nazarites wear their "neotradition- al" dance attire not only for holy dance, but also for home cere- monies such as comings-of-age and weddings (Fig. 1), though not in the identical form seen in the holy festival or gathering. 5. On March 31, 2001, for example, to conclude an African Renaissance conference in Durban, State President Thabo Mbeki attended a King Cetshwayo Award ceremony honouring local heroes, including Isaiah Shembe, with plaques set into the pave- ment in front of City Hall. Making up the great majority of the crowd, and much enlivening the occasion, was a host of several thousand white-gowned Nazarites in the presence of their cur- rent leader M.V. Shembe, son of the founder's son and second successor, Amos Khula Shembe. 6. Praises (izibongo, "praise-poems") are a genre of southern African oratory that celebrate, on public occasions, great peo- ple's characters and deeds. Shembe's praises include "Dancer, they kept forcing him to dance, the ministers, white and black" (Gunner 1984, vol 2:27,33, line 132), which I take to allude to the allegations heard in the church oral history (and at least one white sympathizer's writing) that mission churches spumed his overtures and requests for "instruction in faith" from them. Such closures of any opportunity for dialogue no doubt opened Shembe to Africanist influences within his congregation. One source reports it was his earliest traditional followers who caused the prophet to seek divine guidance concerning tradi- tional dress and dancing (Tracey 1955:405; n.d:30). 7. In November 1950, Galilee submitted an application for government recognition, as he was finding it "difficult to get recognized and approved registered sites in the rural locations which are controlled by the state" (National Archives, Pretoria: file NTS 1431, 24/214 Part 2:141PP). He states that he had "interviewed [sic] the Secretary for Native Affairs," but did "not know how far the matter has been investigated"-lit- tle imagining that this official inertia was to outlast him. 8. In the late 1940s a debate smoldered in the Native Teachers' Journal on the topic of "The Preservation of African Music and Dancing" between proponents of "Primitive Bantu Dancing" and its opponents. The latter sought its removal for "laxity in the matter of sex" and "practices that stimulate and minister to the baser elements in man" (January 1949:100-101). The former supported its promotion in schools because "It has degenerat- ed since the days of old, [thus] this is just the stage at which it needs our attention and control, for it will otherwise gallop downwards." The same writer adds, "Mr. Shembe and his peo- ple have tried to build up typical Bantu dances, which are appreciated for their cleanness and dignity, as well as for their enjoyable rhythm" (April 1949:187-88). 9. White Natal had a long-standing belief in the "menace of Zulu militarism" dating back to the Zulu king Dingane's raid on the early settlement of Port Natal (Durban). Sensitive to this aspect of the colonial psyche, Isaiah Shembe established as cardinal precept that all political affiliation and activism was to be "left at the gate [of the holy places]." Galilee's suc- cessor and brother, Amos Khula Shembe, maintained this quietist approach to politics through the party-political vio- lence of the 1980s in KwaZulu-Natal. 10. It helps to remember that the grand military spectacles of the Zulu kingdom were transformations of the dances of the region's first-fruits ceremonies: In all areas under Zulu domin- ion, no chief was permitted to hold his own ceremony; all were obliged to attend the "great feast" at the Zulu capital that came quickly to resemble a grand parade review, with sophisticated military maneuvers akin to Western-style parades and proces- sions. Religious rite, that is, had become military pageant, and the ukusina dances, having once been a matter of "worshipping with the body," as one elder put it (Webb and Wright 1982:153), became the arena for inter-regimental rivalry and competition, with -sina itself as a result coming to mean "to do better than, to surpass" (Webb and Wright 1982:326). 11. Such apprehensions are heard from, for example, the magis- trate of Hlabisa in Zululand, following the murder of a police- man by a Nazarite in September, 1942: A. H. Astrup declared, "There is no doubt in my opinion that the Shembe sect is both political and nationalistic in origin" (letter to Chief Native Commissioner, September 21, 1942; National Archives, Pretoria: file NTS 1431, 24/214 Part 2). Such convictions gave rise to a hostility later expressed by the magistrate of Verulam, who complained about "diabolical, unjust enrichment under the cloak of religion," and concluded that "the Shembe religion is entirely self-created to suit the private interests of the founder and his successors, and is nothing but a shocking fraud" (letter to Chief Native Commissioner, October 6, 1949; National Archives, Pretoria: file NTS 1431, 24/214 Part 2). 12.
