<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER Norman Austin Preface "Tragedy is dying a pathetic death in thousands of college litera ture classes," wrote Christensen in a recent issue of JGE.1 He goes on to discuss the political trends, at work in our colleges and in the society at large, that have made the tragic vision seem anachronistic, as much to professors as to their students. Admittedly, when I reflect on my undergraduate education, I cannot say that I was any more ready for the dark fatalism of tragedy than our present undergraduates. "Prone to the illu sion of immortality," Christensen continues, "youth has always inclined toward comedy rather than tragedy."2 But granting Christensen's thesis, that tragedy is more remote from today's undergraduates than in previous generations, tragedy has given way to a kind of substitute. The tragic voice has been replaced by a peculiarly modern voice?perhaps Euripides had this voice in his time?which narrates experiences that were once the field of tragedy in a tone of ironic detachment, as if Odys seus had undertaken to tell the story of the Iliad. Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five catches the tone exactly. Whether our in vincible positivism makes us uncomfortable in the face of trag edy, or events in the nuclear age are truly too terrible even for tragedy, the tone students respond to in literature is much like their own, sympathetic but cool, and faintly cynical. But tragedy, by general consent, must be in the curriculum. This essay is from a forthcoming book by Norman Austin, Meaning and Being in Myth, to be published by The Pennsylvania State University Press in 1990.

Teachers, faced with row upon row of students, looking cool to the point of boredom, to whom the declamations of tragedy sound almost comical, settle for a compromise, and may often select a work that purports to be a tragedy but is not. Such a work is Albert Camus's novel, The Stranger, which narrates the fate of the absurd hero, the existentialist, who has, paradoxi cally, achieved almost tragic status by exposing the absurdity of all human constructions, including, especially, tragedy. Several years ago I was led, for reasons neither relevant here nor entirely clear to me, to include The Stranger in a course on myth and archetype. To my surprise, the novel had become a canonical text; most of my students had read it in high school; others, in various college courses in the Humanities. I was more surprised to find that the novel's hero (or antihero) had himself been canonized. Many of my students, often among the more intelligent, whether by their own reading or under the influence of their teachers, took Meursault for a saint, the innocent but painfully lucid victim of society's hypocrisy. Their attachment to Meursault made my work easier, since I could use a familiar text to explore the unfamiliar territory of myth and archetype. On the other hand, I became an icono clast, which I had not exactly intended, by questioning the integrity of my students' hero. This essay has grown from my dialogues over several years, with such students and with my self. Two of my students, who brought their most pointed con centration to the text, I have acknowledged in the essay. But many others have given the text and my interpretation a similar concentration, whom the exigencies of the printed page pre vent my acknowledging by name. Such students, and the dia logue we have shared, lead me to conclude that The Stranger is, whatever its genre, an excellent text to include in the Humani ties curriculum. The Stranger is a compelling work. Its dazzling clarity, bal anced by deepest ignorance, and its momentum have the feel of tragedy. If Meursault is not tragic like Achilles, Oedipus, or King Lear, he conforms to the mythic pattern, so often told and in so many forms in ancient literature, of the hero who stum bles, half-consciously and half unconscious, to his doom. Whether his doom is accidental or intentional, the product of</page><page sequence="3">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 235 inscrutable cosmic forces, or of the hero's own (conscious and unconcious) complicity with his fate, was left to each poet to interpret, when he took the bare facts, like any storyteller, and turned them into poetry or theater. We make the same deci sions when we read their interpretations, whether the dramatist be Sophocles or Albert Camus. If I cannot accept Meursault's plea of innocence, as Camus seems to, and find his ironic de tachment unconvincing, I can respect the play even if I do not entirely respect its protagonist. Camus has caught the tone of our time, and given us something so close to tragedy that it may deserve to be called a classic. "Mother died today." So runs, in Gilbert's translation, the first sentence of The Stranger, a sentence now famous among memo rable literary first lines.3 Aujourd'hui, maman est morte: the sentence is as stoic as an ancient epitaph, as modern as the telegram. We respond sympathetically to this speaker, who speaks without the mask and gestures of tragedy, but as the ordinary man, whose humdrum day leaves no space for oper atic stances, even when the fabric of the day is torn by the intrusion of the extraordinary. Our aged parents end their days in a nursing home, comfortable perhaps, but almost anony mous. Death notices arrive typed and delivered by anonymous hands, and things continue exactly as before. Death, in modern times, calls for a certain minimal ceremony, perhaps a day or two off work. The first sentence of The Stranger records an event almost banal. Yet a merely ordinary man might affect an emotion, believing emotions to be expected of him at such a moment. Meursault will not falsify the record, and for that he gains our admiration. We sense in him the noble Roman fiber. "Or, maybe, yesterday. I can't be sure." So runs the second sentence of the austere first paragraph of The Stranger. Let others affect an emotion. Let the anonymous dispatch from The Home for Aged Persons express its "deep sympathy." Soci ety expects sons to grieve at the death of their mothers, but our protagonist shuns mere social expectations. If it is callous for a son, receiving the telegram announcing his mother's death, to muse on a trivial detail, so be it. Integrity is more to be valued than social approval. In his willingness to acknowledge his flat</page><page sequence="4">236 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION response to his mother's death, Meursault displays a quality almost heroic. Meursault will not ascribe motives to his killing of the Arab not present to his consciousness when he committed the crime. He will not fabricate a defense for himself. He is almost a Socrates, so scrupulous is he to avoid even the semblance of improving his chances of acquittal by some strategy, however acceptable it might be in the eyes of the law. If the court links the hearsay evidence of Meursault's callousness toward his mother with his shooting of the Arab, Meursault gains in stat ure by refusing to participate in a game where the rewards go to the insincere. Let the magistrate or the chaplain talk of God; even threatened with execution, Meursault will not capitulate to social expectations and feign adherence to beliefs imposed on him by others. He makes no excuses for his crime, and offers no defense; condemned to death, he refuses the consola tion of religion. A man of such integrity we are tempted to call a hero. This is not the protagonist of ancient tragedy, the king or warrior on whom the destinies of cities or nations depend, but the modern hero, the existentialist, able to accept with serenity his utter insignificance in a universe devoid of consciousness. No ghosts haunt this man's dreams; no god looms over him, either to inspire him to heroic achievements or to plunge him to his destruction. In this man's cosmology are no ideals, no values, neither good nor evil. His universe is irrational and direc tionless, but Meursault is willing to accept its vacancy. If it is heroic to meet destiny with courage and clear vision, then Meursault, ordinary clerk though he be, seems to have the qualities that entitle him to a place in the company of the ancient heroes. Camus himself looked on Meursault as a new Christ, and many modern commentators have agreed. If the universe is truly random, and all social values mere human artifacts, the modern Christ might indeed be a person who could endure both the false values of society and the uncon sciousness of the universe. Before we too quickly call Meursault, who kills a man with no regret, a modern Socrates, we do well to examine his integrity more closely. The first paragraph of the novel runs thus:</page><page sequence="5">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 237 "Mother died today. Or, maybe yesterday; I can't be sure. The telegram from the Home says: 'YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP SYM PATHY.' Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday" (1). If the first sentence speaks with an almost Roman gravity, the second sentence was spoken by no ancient Stoic. In a crisis, it seems, Meursault falls back on a certain kind of exactitude, fastening on indefiniteness in the telegram as if to reassure himself of his own definiteness. "Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday." So Meursault sums up his response to the announcement of his mother's death. Cal lous? Perhaps, but a welter of emotions can produce a tone of apparent callousness. What is the emotion appropriate to death? Acculturated to banality, who of us has not been non plussed when the numinous touches the deepest chords of our being? Words, if any come, are inadequate, platitudes suffi cient for the ordinary day, but mere echolalia when the abyss opens up at our feet. Grief wears many faces, but the absolut ism of death mocks them all. We accept the first paragraph of The Stranger as the honest response of a man who, unable to comprehend the fact of his mother's death, retreats into a stoic calm. But the first para graph, with its seven terse sentences, contains Meursault's total emotional response to his mother's death (or seems to). The next paragraph talks of Meursault's mental calculations as to the effect of the funeral on his daily routine, and how his boss will react to his request for a leave of absence to attend the funeral. In the next paragraph Meursault admits that the death hasn't really registered; he expects "the funeral will bring it home to me, put an official seal on it, so to speak ..." (2). It does. The officials at the Home for the Aged give the event its place in the social register: they conduct the bereaved son to the corpse when he arrives at the Home; they arrange for the all-night vigil by the corpse; they provide the mourners; they have the coffin lid screwed in place; they make up the funeral procession. A priest and acolytes carry out the registra tion in the religious sphere. The death is given its due, regis tered in all the official forms; everywhere, in fact, except in the heart of the bereaved son. In the whole first chapter, in which</page><page sequence="6">238 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION we are given the announcement of the death and the attendant funeral rites, Meursault shows scarcely a flicker of an emo tional response. Throughout the funeral rites he remains an observer; everything happens around him in a choreography designed by others, in which he is expected to make certain moves. It is all so distant from him that he is less a participant than a spectator observing some alien social rite. Death must have some arcane meaning for other humans; our narrator will observe and record their behavior, doing his best not to offend their sensibilities, but it is a business in which he has no feelings one way or another. The first chapter of The Stranger shows us a character devoid of feelings but with a kind of curiosity, if we can call it that, his sporadic attentiveness to the peculiar mannerisms of others. Meursault has, in place of feelings, sensations. He is hypersensi tive. The silent presence of the mourners who joined him in the vigil by his mother's corpse, he says, "was telling on my nerves." The vigil leaves him aware of his fatigue and the ach ing in his limbs. The walk to the cemetery in the morning heat "blurs" his thoughts; he is aware of the throbbing in his tem ples. Meursault is sensitive to the whitewashed walls of the mortuary, the nickel-coated screws in his mother's coffin, the heat of the day, the glare of the road, the smell of gasoline fumes; to color, light, sound; to moustaches, scarves, furniture, body odors, facial expressions; to almost anything?provided it is not an emotion. Emotions puzzle him. When a woman be gins weeping during the vigil by his mother's corpse, our narra tor is, as he says, "rather surprised" (11). Meursault is so assiduous in calibrating his sensations that he has fooled many into taking him for a man of feeling. On the contrary, he records not feelings but sense data, being the truly modern, who takes only sense data for primary realities, and feelings for subjective impressions. Throughout his visit to the Home for the Aged, in his dealings with the officials and resi dents there, in his vigil by the corpse, in his deportment at the burial, Meursault records only sense data, except for those expressions of irritation or surprise that even a dispassionate scientist might permit himself when a minor inconvenience im pedes the experiment. The feelings Meursault expresses, such as they are, are trivial. Once or twice he apologizes, or affects a</page><page sequence="7">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 239 vaguely apologetic attitude, for causing some inconvenience. He worries, slightly, about the propriety of smoking a cigarette in the presence of a corpse. He is partial to caf? au lait. The mannerisms of the old folks keeping vigil with him irritate his nerves, slightly. Under the guise of the detached observer is a man dissoci ated from his feelings. From the moment when he receives the telgram with its news of his mother's death until his return to the city of Algiers after the funeral, no real feelings intrude into Meursault's record. The first paragraph says it all: ". . . today. Or, maybe, yesterday. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday." What matter? The matter of his mother's death? No, the only matter in doubt is the precise moment of her death.4 This is quibbling, but any of us might do the same. In the face of death, we too might fasten on some inconsequential detail, as if to stave off chaos by rearranging a twig or two. But Meursault fastens only on inconsequential details from start to finish. The quibbling in the first paragraph of the novel is the behavior of a mind habituated to evasion. A small feeling glimmers on the morning after the vigil by the corpse. Meursault, standing outside the mortuary, feels the morning breeze, with its salty tang. "There was the promise of a very fine day," Meursault notes, and catches himself thinking "what an agreeable walk I could have had, if it hadn't been for Mother" (14). This agreeable event, first provided, but then thwarted, by his mother's inconvenient death looms all the larger when we read in the next paragraph that the morning hour, when Meursault would normally be preparing to go to work, was always "the worst hour of the day" for him (14). Mornings, with their promise of renewal, mean for Meursault only a deadening of his spirit, since all he has to look forward to is the dull mechanical routine at the office. In an almost inad vertent slip Meursault admits that his mother's death opens up the prospect of at least one pleasurable morning in his life, but such a thought is unseemly, and the man who is so studiously unconventional shows himself quite conventional in censoring the thought. Psychoanalysts have much to ponder in this brief passage, in which the death of a mother gives the son his first agreeable sensation, bordering on an emotion, which he must forthwith suppress.</page><page sequence="8">240 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION After this small revelation of the inner dynamics of his mind, Meursault allows himself one more expression of genuine feel ing in chapter 1. As he sums up, in the final paragraph of the first chapter, his impressions of the day of the funeral, he re members "my little thrill of pleasure when we entered the first brightly lit streets of Algiers, and I pictured myself going straight to bed and sleeping twelve hours at a stretch." (22)5 With the inconvenience and irritation of the funeral subsiding, and the official seals duly affixed to the event, Meursault can return to his sleep. It is not much, this little pleasure, but in the emotionally anesthetized the smallest emotion speaks volumes. Death is so disagreeable to our narrator?a fact that becomes progressively clearer through the novel?that he will do any thing to avoid responding to, or thinking about, it. He will quibble about details, or fasten on minutiae like a biologist examining an unfamiliar organism; he will, whenever possible, doze off. The prospect of a long, uninterrupted sleep is one of the few thoughts that can arouse in him a "thrill of pleasure." Meursault, we may say, had no particular affection for his mother. So be it. Not every mother is the Madonna. Later in the novel, when the magistrate asks him whether he loved his mother, Meursault replies: "Yes, like everybody else" (83). Earlier, however, Meursault admits that when his mother was living with him, before he arranged for her move to the Home for the Aged, they scarcely had a relationship: "Mother was always watching me, but we hardly ever talked" (3). While the novel implies that Meursault is superior to conventional mores, in fact he is thoroughly conventional, at least in his relations with his mother. He observes all the proprieties expected of the son, but with no warmth, friendship, or pleasure. All Meur sault can remember of his mother by way of personal connec tion is that she stared at him while she was alive, and inconve nienced him in her death. Meursault is honest enough to admit his merely tepid feel ings for his mother, and at his trial this honesty is brought against him. It is unfair, we may say, as indeed we are encour aged by the novel itself to say, to drag his relations with his mother into his trial on a charge of murder. No man is obliged to love his mother. Meursault at least saw that his mother was decently provided for, and what more can society demand?</page><page sequence="9">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 241 Meursault, an artful dramaturge, persuades us to join him in placing the judicial system itself on trial. He would have us believe that the trial proceedings, in bringing forward consider ations of motive, are hopelessly corrupt. By the time the ver dict of guilty is handed down, we have almost been convinced that Meursault is condemned to death for callousness rather than for murder. Meursault's attitude toward his mother is, in fact, germane to the trial since considerations of character and motive are society's mechanism, however imperfect, for tempering blind justice with mercy. If Meursault were emotionally tepid only in his relations with his mother, or if his behavior at her funeral were the major pieces of circumstantial evidence on which he was convicted, we should certainly protest the inequity of the judicial system. The question of his guilt, however, is never in doubt. The prosecution probes to find whether, behind the act of murder, is a man with any kind of emotion at all. The narra tor, who is also our only witness to the proceedings, replays his trial in such a way as to make us believe that the judicial system rendered him invisible. The truth is that the accused resists every attempt by the court to bring him forward into visibility; instead, he retreats into a self-imposed invisibility, from which he can sneer with polite contempt at his fellows as they perform an irrelevant drama, starring an imaginary person, whom they call Monsieur Meursault. Meursault is emotionally anesthetized in every aspect of his life, and here again he is our chief witness. He likes Marie. He likes going for a swim with her; he likes her body, and having sex with her. But when she asks him if he would marry her, he says he "didn't mind; if she was keen on it, we'd get married" (53). Probing for a vestige of an emotion from her lover, Marie asks him, for the second time, if he loves her. He replies "much as before, that her question meant nothing or next to nothing? but I supposed I didn't" (52). Marie continues to probe, but all her probes produce the same noncommittal response. Marie's body produces pleasurable sensations in Meursault's body. One body enjoys conjunction with another. But when Marie interjects her person into the lovemaking and looks for a rela tionship instead of a sensation, Meursault retreats into his ob jectivity, which is his refuge from the world.</page><page sequence="10">242 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION Perhaps Meursault's problem is women. But no, it's the same everywhere we look. Meursault has his little pleasures. He enjoys his cigarettes; on his day off he reads the newspaper, and clips out amusing items for his scrapbook; he sits on his balcony to watch the Sunday afternoon promenade. At one point, Meursault's employer, with plans to open an office in Paris, asks if Meursault would like the opportunity to develop his career there? No, Meursault has no interest in changing his life, though we have already heard him confess that his morn ings are hateful to him. Once, Meursault tells his employer, he had ambition, but now he realizes the futility of such desires. One life is as good as another, Meursault claims (51-52). This would be a noble resignation if genuine, but Meursault's resignation is a mask to cover the emotional void in his rela tions with his mother, his girlfriend, his work, his daily routines in his apartment, his leisure time, his play, his friends. This is not philosophical detachment but an attitude, which, when it comes up against something demanding more than attitude, is revealed for what it is?a persona masking a pathological state of emotional dissociation. Meursault is a somnambulist. Until his trial we are convinced that he is a man incapable of emotion. As his trial proceeds, however, stronger and genuine emotions begin to surface. At the conclusion of the first day's hearings, as Meursault is being driven from the courtroom back to the prison, he hears outside the police van "all the character istic sounds of a town I'd loved" (122). Loved? Nothing in the narrative up to this point suggests that Meursault is capable of love. Meursault likes his cigarette, his caf? au lait, his Sunday paper, a swim in the sea. He enjoys his girlfriend's breasts, her teasing pout, the sea smell in her hair, but love? Now he talks of love, the man who has presented his life as a tedious and meaningless routine, and himself wrapped in ennui. If the word love at this point in the novel strikes a false note, we accept it, as a promise of emotional healing; perhaps, under the threat of execution, he is willing to lift his guard and acknowledge his deeper feelings. After the trial is over, and the verdict delivered, Meursault is confined to his prison cell where he awaits the guillotine. This is, for any convict, a period of hideous emotional confusion, when the condemned, ignorant of the time appointed for his</page><page sequence="11">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 243 execution, knows only that it will take place some morning at dawn. That dawn when Meursault, after a night's vigil by his mother's corpse, steps into the fresh breezes outside the mortu ary, and those loathed mornings, which pull Meursault from sleep to his sleep-walking routines at the office, now take on a special poignancy. Meursault, no longer able to slip into the comfort of unconsciousness, keeps vigil every night over his own death.6 Every morning becomes both a relief from the night's disturbed vigil and a torture, since each dawn may be his last. For a man awaiting his execution all forms of expec tancy are perverted, until he knows not whether he fears or yearns for the guillotine. When the dawn passes, the prisoner knows not whether to believe himself given a special grace or a greater torture. Under such conditions Meursault experiences even stronger emotions. So ingrained is his habit of evasion, however, that the emotions are masked, refused their place, or translated wherever possible into mere sensations. Eavesdropping on his thoughts, as Meursault lives out his final days in his jail cell, we might think we were listening to an ordinary man musing ran domly on an ordinary life, pondering idly this or that more-or less trivial project. Under the mind's casual chatter, however, we discern a man listening to the "faint throbbing" of his own heart (141). Faint indeed. Hitherto Meursault's heart had been virtually an obsolete organ. Now, as his heart becomes func tional, under the threat of execution, the throbbing grows louder, stronger, more insistent. We see him hurrying to the door of his cell every time he hears a sound outside, listening so intently that he hears his breathing "quick and hoarse like a dog's panting" (142). He dreams now of escape; he dreams that his appeal is successful; the thought sends "a rush of joy" through his body and brings tears to his eyes (143). But his emotions are tabu, and must be suppressed. He compels him self to calm down: "It was up to me to bring my nerves to heel and steady my mind; for, even in considering this possibility, I had to keep some order in my thoughts" (143). Successful in routing the unruly emotions, our protagonist takes pride in his work, glad to have "earned a good hour's peace of mind" (144). Meursault will do almost anything to gain an hour's peace of mind, and long practice has developed into a fine</page><page sequence="12">244 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION proficiency. He can sit through his trial, and hear himself con demned to execution, without the testimony of the witnesses, the arguments of the prosecution, or the cross-examination causing more than a ripple of boredom and impatience across his peace of mind. We are led to believe that we are eavesdropping on a man's dialogue with his deepest, most intimate self, when Meursault reveals the drift of his mind in those final days of his life be tween his trial and the execution. In fact, the self Meursault communicates with is nothing more than a surface self, since he has excluded so much of himself from conscious recognition that he hardly has a self to communicate with, or a language in which to communicate. But he is clever enough to persuade us, almost, that the equanimity he achieves in his prison cell ex presses an enlightened detachment. Meursault certainly has himself persuaded until the chaplain walks in on him unexpectedly. Meursault lies on his cot in his cell, musing on his girlfriend Marie, and in his somnambulistic fashion thinking that, without their physical conjunction, noth ing now remains to remind either of them of the other. The priest, breaking in on Meursault's thoughts, begins to speak of God. Meursault responds as we would expect; he has no belief in God, nor any interest in other people's thoughts on the subject. A man who denies a real existence to his emotions will certainly give no credence to some metaphysical abstraction in the sky. The priest continues to probe, and Meursault's boredom turns to mild interest as he perceives the priest's increasing emotional agitation. Suddenly, in a reversal almost as momentous as the peripeteia in ancient tragedy, the agitation shifts from the priest to the condemned man. At first Meursault finds the priest's interrogation merely irksome, and his pronouncements about God, guilt, and the afterlife irrelevant. Then something in Meursault breaks. Meursault begins screaming. Grabbing the priest's cassock, Meursault pours out all his rationalizations "in a sort of ecstasy of joy and rage" (151). A storm of self righteousness erupts in the prison cell, so violent that the guards come in to release the chaplain from the prisoner's grip. Meursault claims that his ecstasy was prompted by the priest's cocksure attitude, but the opposite is true. The explo sion detonates when Meursault's own self-righteousness is</page><page sequence="13">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 245 threatened. "Actually, I was sure of myself," Meursault says, "sure about everything, far surer than he [the chaplain]; sure of my present life and of the death that was coming. ... I'd been right, I was still right, I was always right" (151). True, Camus has staged the scene to prejudice us against the priest. The priest, given to sanctimonious platitudes, confuses the issue by talking of the afterlife, bringing in at least implicitly the machin ery of punishments and rewards that any modern person would be justified in rejecting as medieval sentimentality. But, with his shibboleths, his tearful gaze, and his fondness for playing surrogate father, the priest is only the manifest provocation. The truth is that Meursault's cosmology, so rigorously con structed, and daily rehearsed, proves inadequate to the ulti mate test, and years of suppressed emotions burst the dam and flood the prison cell. If Camus had allowed a psychotherapist to visit Meursault at this moment, a true therapist of the soul, Meursault's liberation might have been complete. The therapist might have baptized the condemned man in that flood of emotion, and transformed the liberated anger into the grace of the Eumenides. But no, Camus would not grant his prisoner that grace, nor us. His priest must be a clich?, a voice canting outmoded ideologies. So the baptism is proscribed, and Meursault must die with a specious understanding, tragically unreconciled. Meursault himself takes his explosion for a true catharsis. The rush of anger cleansed him, he says, and emptied him of hope; "gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars," Meursault says, "for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I'd been happy, and that I was happy still" (154). Meursault falls asleep after his outburst, and when he wakes he sees the stars shining, hears the sounds of the countryside, feels the cool night air moving in his cell, hears a steamer's siren in the dis tance. For the first time in the novel Meursault even shows some understanding of his mother, and experiences empathe tically her feelings as she faced her own death in the Home for the Aged. Yet, despite the lyricism of the final paragraph of the novel, Meursault is not a reliable witness. True, Meursault has experi</page><page sequence="14">246 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION enced a high emotional state, and for one moment moves be yond his alienation to experience the bond between him and the universe. But in the next moment, in his last utterance in the novel, Meursault states that all that remains for him ("so that I might feel less alone," as he puts it in a pregnant clause) is to hope that a large crowd of spectators will gather to witness his execution, and "that they should greet me with howls of execration" (154). Such is his last will and testament. Poor heart, it opens, but the shock is too great, and Meursault re treats into the habit of his alienation. The curses Meursault invokes on himself are the cries of a man locked in the lazaret of his own making. Until the priest's appeals unloose Meursault's pent-up anger, the novel is situated in a world where emotions are virtually banished, or appear as the curious mannerisms of beings whom the protagonist cannot comprehend. After the priest's visit to Meursault in his prison cell the last few pages of the novel? four, in Gilbert's translation?are vivid with emotion, but the emotions are fear, anger, and hate. Where is humor in his cosmology, or joy? Why are so many emotions tabu? By what impulses was Meursault directed to build his lazaret to quaran tine him from life? Under the priest's probing Meursault admits to feeling fear so intense that it blocks out any other feeling. Meursault de scribes eloquently the source of his fear: "from the dark hori zon of my future a sort of slow, persistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long, from the years that were to come. And on its way the breeze had leveled out all the ideas that people had tried to foist on me in the equally unreal years I was then living through" (152).7 Knowledge of his own death is the only valid idea in Meursault's cosmology, which negates all other ideas, and his fear of death the emotion that negates all other emotions. Holding to his consciousness of his own death as the only certainty, Meursault falls into the fal lacy of our age, and takes everything else for illusion, elabora tions spun by the mind to veil its own fear. Almost everything else, we should say, since as a modern, Meursault grants valid ity to one set of mental operations?immediate sense impres sions. In our modern cosmology, which takes sensations for objective data, emotions, seen as unreal themselves, lead to</page><page sequence="15">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 247 unreal ideas?the soul, conscience, the collective welfare, guilt and responsibility, ideas that Meursault claims other peo ple foisted on him in his earlier years before he saw through their pretense. He will have none of them. Meursault lives only in the moment, but here too he only simulates enlighten ment. He assumes that sense data provide unmediated knowl edge, and that they are thus truer than the webs of cognitive structures that the history of the human psyche reveals. But the unmediated sense datum is a fiction, and the separation of sensations from emotions rests on an arbitrary decision. The moment-by-moment sensations by which Meursault registers his own existence are carefully circumscribed to conform to his own definition of both moment and sensation. Meursault has never experienced Blake's discovery of all Eternity in a grain of sand. Meursault has not transcended human ideas and emotions; he simply represses most of them. Meursault invites our collaboration by affecting an integrity free of the claptrap of several thousand years of human cogita tion. Meursault goes to a martyr's death, so Camus would sug gest, as the heroic victim of the claptrap he has chosen to reject. But his is a spurious integrity. Our sympathy is carefully managed in the events surrounding the trial, in the proceedings of the trial, in Meursault's confinement in the prison cell, and in his encounters with the magistrate and the priest?the two mouthpieces for society, secular and spiritual. Throughout these events Meursault presents his customary persona as the slightly quizzical observer of folkways foreign to him. He finds it difficult to comprehend that he is indeed the person on trial; that strangers are accusing him of murder; that he is the pris oner, the defendant, the criminal. Who of us could recognize himself or herself if we were to eavesdrop on discussions held by strangers, in which we were the object of their remarks, criticisms, or hypotheses? When Meursault complains that the legal system functions "to exclude me from the case, to put me off the map, so to speak, by substituting the lawyer for myself," we nod in agreement (130). Who among us have not stood with Meursault, in our minds, seeing ourselves on trial for our indi viduality, with a hostile society as the judge and jury? Orches trating such feelings, which lie deep in our souls, Camus stages the trial to appear a travesty of justice. Meursault's presence in</page><page sequence="16">248 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION the courtroom is made irrelevant to the case. Judgments are based on innuendo, flagrant manipulation of circumstantial evi dence, and by direct appeals to sentiment and prejudice. The trial is made to seem the juggernaut of the herd instinct. At one point in the trial, irked by what he sees as a "conspir acy" to exclude him from the proceedings, Meursault has the urge to break in to announce that he is the man on trial and that he has "something really important" to say (124). On second thought, he realizes that he has "nothing to say." Ironically, tragically, he is correct on both counts. By deliberate intent he has nothing to say to the court, having excluded himself as a participant in the trial, as he had excluded himself from the murder under discussion in the court. In his silence Meursault maintains his customary persona, as the man with no deep convictions or ideas, and no strong desire to articulate them even if he had them. In fact, he has much to say, at least to us, who are privy to his more intimate thoughts. His record of the trial is an exercise in self-justification. When the verdict is deliv ered, we have almost forgotten that the charge was murder, and have been led to believe that Meursault is convicted for having no soul, for showing no remorse after the crime, for his nonconformity. Meursault gives us to believe that the prosecu tion manipulated the trial; in fact, Meursault is the manipula tor, who assumes the pose of silent resignation, all the while constructing the case for himself as the innocent scapegoat for society's hypocrisy. Always the innocent, Meursault is a man to whom things happen. In all the arrangements for his mother's funeral Meursault does nothing except what is assigned to him, or ex pected of him. The authorities at the Home take care of the legal and practical details, and the priest fulfills the religious obliga tions. Meursault goes along with the arrangements, though he is an atheist and claims that his mother was one also. He attends the body as expected; he walks with the funeral procession; he attends the burial. In all these rites Meursault makes no gesture toward the deceased that is authentically his own, except to muse that he might have had a pleasant morning, but for his mother's death. With Marie he is the same emotionally passive person, whose indifference cuts to the bone. A symptom of Meursault's pathology is that he frequently</page><page sequence="17">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 249 dozes off, or wishes to do so, to escape the pressures of the moment. He is frequently tired, overcome by the heat, dazed by the light; he is easily bored, even by his own trial?an event that he finds "tedious." At one point in the trial, when a sound from outside the courtroom opens him up to a rush of memo ries, Meursault has "only one idea: to get it over, to go back to my cell, and sleep . . . and sleep" (132). Whenever life calls for Meursault to participate, Meursault retreats into nonchalance, boredom, or sleep. Meursault's attitude, as always the object of others' action and never the subject, culminates in his murder of the Arab. When Meursault takes his walk along the beach to the fatal encounter, he has already engaged in one fight with the Arabs, and his friend Raymond has already been wounded. Despite the obvious danger, and the prior hostilities, Meursault chooses to take his walk alone, carrying a loaded revolver, to the very place where the hostile engagement has just taken place. His excuse is that he wants to get away from the emotional turbulence in his friend's house; he wants some peace and quiet. But, to find his peace, he goes to the very rock and stream were he and Ray mond have just seen the Arabs. The only explanation Meursault can offer in his own trial for the shooting is that "it was because of the sun" (130). Camus's description of the moment of the shooting is one of the most extraordinary paeans to the sun's violence in literature. The heat and light on the beach that day were like superhuman agencies, pressing in on Meursault relentlessly. Meursault clenches his fist and keys up his nerves, to fend off "the dark befuddlement" the sun was pouring into him. The sun scorches Meursault's skin; his forehead threatens to burst from internal pressure; the sky is a sea of molten steel; Meursault's eyes are blinded by tears; the light reflected off the Arab's knife scars his eyelashes and gouges his eyeballs: "Then everything began to reel before my eyes, a fiery gust came from the sea, while the sky cracked in two, from end to end, and a great sheet of flame poured down through the rift. Every nerve in my body was a steel spring, and my grip closed on the revolver. The trigger gave, and the smooth underbelly of the butt jogged my palm" (76). Hypnotized by his eloquence, we overlook the real cata clysm, which is Meursault's retreat from responsibility.</page><page sequence="18">250 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION Meursault is prone to befuddlement. The sun befuddles his mind when he confronts the Arab on the beach, as it had befuddled him during the walk to his mother's grave. His mind blurs over when he kills the Arab, as it blurs in the trial, when he is forced to sit through the interminable drone of others discussing his "soul" (to use his quotes). In many small ways Meursault displays the same inclination to retreat to a per plexed ignorance. This pose, which Meursault maintains with studied rigor, reaches its extreme when Meursault admits to feeling little regret for committing the murder. A man not responsible for his actions need be troubled by no regrets. During the trial Meursault wishes he could explain to the prose cutor, "in a quite friendly, almost affectionate way, that I had never been able really to regret anything in all my life" (127). How could an automaton experience regret? In the behaviorist paradigm, which is the foundation of Meursault's cosmology, the universe is a random spin of uncon scious matter, and the human, the microcosmic reflection, is a collection of reflex responses. If humans like to believe them selves endowed by some Creator with ideas, emotions, or pur poses , that is the ultimate absurdity in an absurd world. Meaning less itself, the universe is indifferent to all human constructions of meaning. Volition and motivation being, for this philosophy, archaisms, intellectual honesty calls us to repudiate meaning in our existence, or direction in the universe at large. But the uni verse is mindless, provided we remove our minds from consider ation. If the same forces that produce protein molecules have also produced our consciousness, what is our evidence that the universe is indifferent to consciousness? If we experience signifi cance, by what argument do we deny significance to the natural order? We construct a universe without meaning only by disenfranchising ourselves. The ideology of The Stranger represents the universe as a blank, emotionally and spiritually; a cosmos where inanimate matter is the prime element, and coincidence substitutes for cause. The protagonist, moulding himself to this ideology, erases from his mind any ideas contaminated by the mythical or theological bias, which interprets the world in terms of agent and cause. Yet, despite its rejection of the imagination, The Stranger is the modern version of the ancient myth of a hero's combat</page><page sequence="19">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 251 with the primeval powers. The hero of ancient myth was defined by a relationship to a deity, which was both symbiotic and adver sarial. Ovid's Metamorphoses is a long recital of catastrophic meetings of humans and their gods. Pentheus was destroyed in his encounter with Dionysus. Actaeon, the hunter, was felled by the anger of Artemis, his goddess, when he came upon her naked. Semele, following Hera's blandishments, was burned to ash when her lover Zeus revealed himself to her in his full being. Arachne, best of weavers, was transformed to a spider by Athena, goddess of weaving, for daring to call herself Athena's equal. The musician Marsyas was flayed alive for competing with the god of music. Phaethon was destroyed by Helios, his father, for driving the solar chariot beyond its appointed course. Such myths, of heroes blasted when they trespass on the numinous, tell of the grandiose ego that has overreached itself.8 In The Stranger the numinous adversary is Helios, whom we recognize as the divine adversary in many ancient myths, and the encounter is as elemental as the meeting of god and human in any ancient tragedy. In a spare, modern style, without re course to the personas and machinery of ancient myth, Camus presents a myth as tragic as Euripides' drama of Pentheus. As the ancient hero's mind was unhinged by the provocative Dio nysus, so Meursault's mind is unhinged by the naked power of Helios. Like the heroes of old, Meursault goes about his mun dane business, but suddenly, as in ancient tragedies, the numinous breaks through the mundane and shatters his life. The sun alone is the cause, Meursault claims, which made him pull the trigger of the revolver in his hands and release the bullet. As in the ancient myths, the protagonist in this anti mythical myth is both victim and unsuspecting agent of forces beyond his control or comprehension. The hero's adversary in the ancient myths was, of course, a god, who was assumed to act from some kind of motive? injured honor, jealousy, or anger. The sun, in Camus's novel, is devoid of anthropomorphic motives, being the novelist's en gine to destroy all considerations of motive or character. Meursault is a set of reflexes, like the salmon smolt slipping mindlessly downstream, except that, in this case, the reflexes reached for a revolver, took precise aim, and fired one bullet, then four more, point blank into a man's body. But any talk of</page><page sequence="20">252 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION motive here is construction after the fact. To convict the unwit ting carrier of those reflexes of a criminal offense is an absur dity. It was "pure chance," Meursault says, which led him to walk, with a revolver in hand, to the stream where the hostile encounter with the Arabs had just taken place (110). Crimes presume agents and motives, and here there are neither. Camus will have none of the old mythical agents of human destiny, but, paradoxically, by denying any reality to the gods of myth, with their subtle interchanges on the theme of Being, Camus effaces the ego too as the locus of thought and action. Meursault had no thoughts of murder when the bullets left the revolver in his hand, nor any afterwards. The event, which holds the attention of so many people in the courtroom, is a nonevent (in Meursault's mind), there being no one present to plan the shooting, to perform the killing, or to reflect on it afterwards. The judicial process becomes a windy ramble about nothing. In Meursault's cosmology the sun is simply a material body of enormous and, in this instance, fatal power. Yet like the deities of myth, even here the sun is the archetypal signifier of under standing. Meursault's encounter with the sun is the climax in a series of signifiers, tending all in the same direction. Meursault, who cannot see himself a murderer when the bullets from his revolver pierce another man's body, will assume no responsibil ity for any other action in his so-called life. His mother's funeral, Marie's feelings, his participation in the shady affairs of his friend Raymond, the loaded revolver in his hands, the walk up the beach, the blinding sun: everywhere we see, through the changing scenes, the same protagonist, and always disclaiming his responsibility. How could Meursault be responsible if his only defense is that a man is at the mercy of his reflexes? But where does that put the mind and its signifiers? Meursault's cosmology grows from an intention, which is covert and far from scientific. By stripping the world of its mythical icons, those final witnesses of Being, Meursault pre tends to erase his own ego from the canvas at the same time. Suffering neither the gaze of the Almighty nor his own, Meur sault presents himself as a fair imitation of a man with no investment in the world. Trial, defense, conviction, and, fi nally, execution?let others handle such matters who have an</page><page sequence="21">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 253 investment in them, even as Meursault leaves his mother's death to those likely to profit from the event. Meursault re serves only the right to mutter a mild complaint in our ear, of his exclusion from the legal process, as if his person were being made over into an object by some nonsensical social code. The truth is the opposite. Meursault objects to the court's determi nation to make sense of the Arab's death, and resents most of all others investing his being with their meanings when he has declared all being meaningless. Having made himself into an object, he will not have himself personified, as if he were a subject acting of his own free will. Meursault first depersonalizes himself as a ruse for psychic survival, and then, in a more cunning and desperate ruse, charges society with the crime; society, after all, coins the signi fies, and calls reflex action a crime. Meursault achieves, in the eyes of some, a kind of sainthood for transcending the ego, but his rage at the prison chaplain tells a more convincing truth: "I'd been right, I was still right, I was always right"?this is the voice of an ego so displaced that it will commit murder to justify its displacement (151). This man has his signifiers too, to which he is passionately attached, even while denying their significance. "I was questioned several times immediately after my arrest," Meursault says, never thinking to question himself (77). How can there be sainthood without self-examination, and how can there be an examination when the self has been spirited away? Pretending to have neither preferences nor choices, Meursault chooses solipsism, granting no reality to any signifiers but his own, and then, reversing himself, denying reality even to them. Meursault, standing with his friend Raymond on the beach, confronting the hostile Arabs, revolver in hand, has a moment of insight: "Just then it crossed my mind that one might fire, or not fire?and it would come to absolutely the same thing" (72). Soon Meursault is back at the same place on the beach, the loaded revolver again in his hand, confronting the same Arabs who had just wounded his friend. The trigger is pulled; five bullets ejected; the Arab killed with the precision of coinci dence, as if some proposition were being put to the test; and we have the perfect alibi: the blinding sun. "C'?tait le hasard," Meursault says of his rendezvous with destiny.9 If the reflexes</page><page sequence="22">254 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION alone are responsible, the signifier is deposed, and unconscious instinct crowned in its place. But who is this person, whose instincts so coincided with intention that not so much as a hairline intervened for con sciousness, who cannot discriminate between killing and not killing? A man who cannot say whether he loves or not, or keep his mind on the arguments presented in his trial, but must inform us of his ennui, has hardly proven himself the master at deciphering the signifiers of the universe. Is the decision to kill or not the same for the killer and the killed alike? Do the Arab's family and friends count for nothing? Brutes may not count, but we do; once evolved into the species that differenti ates, we have no path back to unity but through the gates of the signifier.10 Meursault, though he claims to make no distinc tions, is himself adept at discrimination, at least when emotions must be placed under quarantine. Alienated from his own feelings, Meursault reads alienation as the universal condition. His case is as baffling as it is tragic. He is so acute in his observations, so scrupulous in recording minute-by-minute data, and noting his restlessness, drowsi ness, or boredom, that we are convinced of his superior vision. After his catharsis we are all the more ready to be convinced, but we are fooled; even after catharsis he is tangled, tragically, in his signifiers. A man who insists on his right to kill, with reflex action and coincidence as his defense, is, in a curious and tragic way, enlightened and unenlightened at the same time. Like the heroes of myth, Meursault is blinded by the narrow slit of his personal consciousness, which he equates with univer sal vision. Meursault, in the litany of self-justification that he recites to us and the prison chaplain, says that nothing has the least im portance to him. "What difference could they make to me, the deaths of others, or a mother's love, or his [the priest's] God; or the way man decides to live, the fate he thinks he chooses, since one and the same fate was bound to 'choose' not only me but thousands of millions of privileged people who, like him, called themselves my brothers. Surely, surely he must see that?" (152). The logic here is of the intellect using signifiers to cancel signifiers, without canceling them, until, wearied of its crosspurposes, it drowses back into unconsciousness.</page><page sequence="23">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 255 Protestations notwithstanding, Meursault is far from indiffer ent to his own fate. The anger of the last pages, betraying the novel's stance of clinical objectivity, reveals Meursault as, in fact, a man of passion, who cloaks his passion in indifference to protect his own vulnerability. But so beholden is he to the confusion of his signifiers that death, not life, is his passion, as he admits while awaiting his execution. Meursault, fixated on death, generates a plot to revolve around three deaths: the death of his mother from old age; the death of the Arab from a bullet wound; and finally his own execution, following the Arab's death sequentially but not causally, cause and effect being excluded by the rules of the plot and replaced by coinci dence. The common feature in all three is Meursault's dis claimer of his personal investment in any of them, yet this is the same man who talks, with haunting eloquence, of "the dark horizon of my future," from which "a sort of slow, persistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long, from the years that were to come" (152). His obsession with his own death blinds him to any deaths but his own. Death, which ridicules every initiative, in Meursault's cos mology, is the objective fact that reduces the world to an object and all relations to object relations. Meursault, believing him self a mere object in the path of faceless, impersonal forces, dedicates himself to becoming as unconscious as the forces that he believes determine his fate. Nothing in the novel indicates that Meursault has experienced more than object relations with anyone in his life. He never saw his father. His mother was only an object to him, as much when she was alive as when she was a corpse, as he assumes that he, likewise, was no more than an object for her. With Marie, his neighbors, his friends, the mag istrate, the court, the jailer, the prison chaplain, Meursault maintains the same depersonalized relations. The man killed by the bullets from his revolver is also an object, no more significant than bullets or revolvers. Obsessed with his own death, Meursault will not risk an authentic relationship, since he needs all his resources to keep his fears at bay and maintain his objectivity. But Meursault's depersonalized relations with others are a symptomatic reflection of a deeper malaise: to escape consciousness, Meursault must maintain only an object relationship with himself. Meursault first depersonalizes him</page><page sequence="24">256 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION self, then others; finally, he depersonalizes the universe to re flect back to him the emptiness he has inscribed in his heart.11 Meursault is devoted to death like the ancient warrior dedi cated to his war god. In his final days in his prison cell, while musing on his impending execution, Meursault recalls a story his mother had told him about the father he had never known. His father, according to his mother's story, once witnessing a public execution, had returned home, and was "violently sick" (138). This fourth death, mentioned almost in parenthesis, as a memory of a memory, is the seed from which the novel grows. How strange, for the psychoanalyst, that this story makes the only reference in the novel to the protagonist's father; strange, too, that the only connection made between father and son is the story, passed on to the child, of his father's reaction to a public execution. But strangest of all, the child grows up to become a murderer condemned to execution. Thus the son, engineering his own execution, creates his relationship with his father. On first hearing the story, Meursault remembers, he had thought his father's conduct disgusting. "But now I under stood; it was so natural. How had I failed to recognize that nothing was more important than an execution; that, viewed from one angle, it's the only thing that can genuinely interest a man?" (35).12 Hypnotized by the story of a public execution, Meursault relives the story by becoming the criminal, whom he had so long imagined, and the executioner, and by one further projec tion joins the crowd to shower curses on the condemned man in his final moments. So numbed by fear that he can neither find meaning in his life nor experience his authentic being, Meur sault stages a tragedy to invest his life with meaning and feel ing. This overzealous ego must play dramatist, protagonist, the chorus of keen-eyed reporters, and jeering audience, to be all parts?the murderer, the murdered, witness, and judge, all in one. The innocent martyr becomes the focus of attention: mag istrate, judges, friends, the jailer, the Arabs, the chaplain?all are drawn to the fateful precipice, to witness Icarus plunge to his death. Meursault takes some interest in the presence of the report ers in the courtroom, when they are pointed out to him, and feels something akin to gratitude at first when he grasps their</page><page sequence="25">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 257 function, to be his ears and eyes, and broadcast his story to the world. Then his eyes are drawn to the eyes of the one reporter who, with his pencil laid aside, fixes his gaze on the defendant with a compelling force. Et j'ai eu impression bizarre d'etre regard? par moi-m?me: "I had the bizarre impression of being observed by myself."13 Meursault confesses himself disori ented, and with good reason, since the secret rises here almost to consciousness, that narcissism may contrive murder, to jus tify its objectivity; and suicide, to find, past objectivity, its real being.14 Meursault's universe is neither indifferent nor benign, and to kill a man is by no means a neutral act. Meursault creates his drama both to confirm and to engender his anger. He will be heartless to prove the universe heartless. He makes himself into a murderer to reveal the murderous intent at the heart of the universe; he has himself placed behind bars to signify his quarantine; he is remorseless, to himself no less than to others, to take his revenge on a universe without remorse. Like Narcissus, Meursault is doomed in all his relations with the world. Though the drama places him at the center of atten tion, he is still only object, not person, since he refuses to acknowledge his intention. Significance must exist only for oth ers, not for Meursault, who has removed himself to some hal lowed ground beyond the reach of significance, and the signifi cance our hero dies for is itself canceled. Narcissism negates all other egos and then, bereft of witnesses, it negates itself. Stag ing a tragedy, in which to play all the parts, Meursault dis misses it as an absurd fiction, performed and witnessed by persons equally absurd. The revelation, glimpsed in the ex change between the eyes of the criminal and the eyes of his reporter, fades before it can be deciphered, leaving Meursault confused, as if returned suddenly from deep hypnosis. The numinous signifier quickly blurs in the hubbub of the court, and our protagonist regains his habitual insignificance. Meursault is a vortex of contradiction. Contemptuous of all ideas, he prides himself on his own. Absenting himself from human relations, he accuses society of investing his life with a significance he refuses to accept, while registering his com plaint against society for treating him as a nonperson: objectiv ity cancels itself. Indifferent to death, he permits in his con</page><page sequence="26">258 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION sciousness almost no space for any thoughts except of his own death. In his contradictions Meursault conforms exactly to He gel's portrait of the skeptic. Skepticism, Hegel writes, "an nounces the nullity of seeing, hearing, and so on, while itself sees and hears. It proclaims the nothingness of essential ethical principles, and makes those very truths the sinews of its con duct. Its deeds and its words belie each other continually. . . . But it keeps asunder the poles of this contradiction within itself."15 Consciousness lights on one impression after another in this novel, with no consciousness to mediate between them, since the protagonist, while proud of his superior conscious ness, uses consciousness to deny consciousness. This flickering consciousness is mystified at the traces of a more extended consciousness in others, as Meursault is nonplussed at anyone's expression of grief or love. This consciousness differentiates even as it repudiates differ entiation; it despises others for their emotions while permitting anger in itself; it claims clarity of vision while repudiating per ception; it fairly boasts of its integrity and denies the value of integrity. Such a consciousness is, as Hegel describes it, "an absolutely fortuitous embroglio, the giddy whirl of a perpetu ally self-creating disorder. This is what it takes itself to be; for itself maintains and produces this self-impelling confusion. Hence it even confesses the fact; it owns to being an entirely fortuitous individual consciousness?a consciousness which is empirical, which is directed upon what admittedly has no real ity for it, which obeys what, in its regard, has no essential being, which realizes and does what it knows to have no truth. . . . This form of consciousness is, therefore, aimless fickleness and instability of going to and fro, hither and thither."16 Meursault, having cut away his Ground of Being, in the name of Being, has nothing left, after reducing his trial to insignificance, but to reduce his death to the same insignifi cance. But, by a puzzling inversion, the signifier marking death's insignificance emerges as a curse, like an arrow sprung from the archer's bow, which is deflected back upon the archer. Even the curse is not authentic, there being no consciousness present to utter it, but it must reach the protagonist as though projected from a host of witnesses, whose hatred, returning</page><page sequence="27">THE EMPIRICAL STRANGER 259 his, will enhance his pain (154). But the evil eye, which Meursault invokes to make his dying less lonely, has no more significance than anything else in his life, and the curtain closes on the protagonist marking his imprisoned being with one final, inconclusive signifier. Holding all myths to be meaningless, Meursault tells a myth as old as Eden, of the mind blinding itself to hide from the gaze of its signifiers. Notes 1. Vol. 39 (1987): 164. 2. Bryce J.
