Cambridge, Massachusetts. x + 152 pp., 80 text fig- ures. ISBN 0-262-20105-4. $20.00 (cloth). From the tiniest insects to the largest aircraft, all things that fly obey the same aerodynamic principles. Regardless of size, structure, or energy source, they must all find ways to generate lift and minimize drag. Mechanics of flight and means by which various flying creatures, devices, and aircraft comply with those physical laws are the subject of this book. The author is a professor of aeronautical engineering with an interest in flying animals, and is not a zoolo- gist. He takes delight in showing us that the basic physics of flight is not formidable and that it explains a lot about how animals and machines fly as they do. He begins by setting forth the fundamental factors that govern flight and explaining relations between them. This opens the way for a comprehensive diagram that plots various flying animals and aircraft ranging from a fruit fly to a jumbo jet according to weight, cruising speed, and wing loading. The chart presents a lot of data in a form that allows ready comparisons and study. A crane fly and a House Wren (Troglodytes ae- don), for example, turn out to have the same weight/ wing loading relationship as a 747 jet airplane, and many other fliers are close to the trend line. It is worth- while to see which other animals and aircraft deviate from it (e.g., pteranodon, Ruby-throated Humming- bird, Archilochus colubris) and ponder why. Tennekes next takes up the energy cost of flying for birds and airplanes in different modes of flight. This leads him to examine energy values of various fuels and foodstuffs and efficiencies of different energy con- version processes. As before, reducing entities to basic physical units yields some surprising comparisons. Whole milk, for instance, is more than twice as ex- pensive as peanut butter in terms of cost per unit of work (megajoules), five times as expensive as vege- table oil, and more than thirty times as expensive as kerosene or diesel oil. A discussion of the food re- quired by migrating birds links costs of flight with sources of energy. Since fat yields twice as much en- ergy as sugar, most migrants eat heavily before and during their trip to build up their fat deposits. The next chapters examine effects of wind and weather on flying, physics of gliding and soaring, dy- namics of taking off and landing, and balance of forces and their relation to speed in flapping and gliding flight. The relationships between physical factors ex- plain a great deal about why different birds fly as they do. Alcids, for example, fly much faster and less ma- neuverably than gulls because they must flap their rel- atively smaller wings more rapidly to generate enough lift. Another intriguing diagram compares gliding per- formance of various butterflies, birds, and aircraft. Lastly, Tennekes draws lessons from paper air- planes, ultralight aircraft, and jumbo jets. He leads the reader through the basic calculations of flight param- eters to show how the design construction of the first ultralights was arrived at. Turning to the 747, he re- peats the exercise, adding fuel consumption and eco- nomics of transportation to the design considerations. The author champions this airplane as one of the great engineering wonders of the world. Because it is the only jetliner that conforms to strict engineering logic, it is more productive and economical than any other means of transportation. The book is aimed at lay readers and it succeeds. While instructive and mildly technical, it is not a text- book of aeronautics. The writing is clear and inviting, enlivened with personal asides and anecdotes. Physical concepts are defined and freely referred to, but in such as way as not to scare off non-engineers. The numer- ous simple equations and diagrams are understandable with no more than high school math. One is led through them with explanations as to how the values are derived. (Even this mathematically-challenged re- viewer was able to follow them.) It would have been helpful to have repeated all definitions and symbols in a glossary at the end. Several other books are comparable in giving the fundamentals of aeronautics. This one stands out, how- ever, in showing some of the similar and different ways in which animals and machines solve the prob- lems of flight. Its approach of reducing these problems to basic physical units (e.g., weight, wing area, energy, speed) makes it possible to compare diverse fliers over a wide size range, giving fresh insights into their de- sign and performance. One weakness is that causes of lift and drag are never explained and there are no diagrams of airflow around a wing. The surface/volume ratio and the ef- fects of scale are inadequately discussed. The writing is anthropomorphic in places, e.g., "courageous" little migrant passerines. Differences in the modes of soar- ing of albatrosses, vultures, and gulls are ignored, and generalizations about "the hummingbird" and migrant passerines result in some questionable statements. An appendix tabulates weight, wing area, wingspan, and cruising speed for many birds, compiled from the literature. These data are valuable because they enable readers to do their own calculations and comparisons. The species are listed in order of ascending weight, which makes sense to an engineer but not to an orni- thologist. Regrettably, many of the scientific names are obsolete or misspelled. The layout is attractive, thanks to generous use of space. In addition to charts and diagrams, the book is illustrated with simple black-and-white drawings of seeds, insects, birds, and aircraft in flight. Although the drawings are captioned with flight data from the appendix, they are largely decorative because most of them are not referred to in the text. The bibliography is short but adequate for steering interested readers into the literature. C. J. Pennycuick's name is misspelled, as it is in the text. This book is a good, readable primer on the basics of how things fly. Readers who want to learn the op- eration of the wings in insects and birds, the different [841]</page><page sequence="2">842 BOOK REVIEWS kinds of flight in birds, and the suite of adaptations for avian flight will have to seek elsewhere, such as Georg Riippell's Bird Flight (1977, Van Nostrand Reinhold). The present book's strength lies in its approach to eval- uating flight performance and the resulting compari- sons between insects, birds, and aircraft. One can find here ideas for teaching and thinking about the evolu- tion of animal flight.-PETER STETTENHEIM, HC 64, Box 255, Lebanon, NH 03766-7607, e-mail: peter.stettenheim@valley.net</page></plain_text>
