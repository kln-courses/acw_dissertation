<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greetings: On Levinas and the Wagging Tail Diane Davis If I have a duty [devoir]?something owed before any debt, before any right?toward the other, wouldn't it then also be toward the animal, which is still more other than the other human, my brother or my neighbor? ?Jacques Derrida If Kenneth Burke describes identification as another "name for the function of sociality" (Attitudes 267), Emmanuel Levinas depicts the interruption in identification as an encounter with the other as other, with a surplus of alterity that I can neither appropriate nor abdicate, and that therefore calls my self-sufficiency and spontaneity into question. Levinas describes this encounter as the opening of ethics: "We name this calling into question of my spontaneity by the presence of the other, ethics" (Totality 43). This interruption of self that opens the experience of the ethical relation takes place as a greeting, an address that operates as a performative intrusion.1 The address as such, the "Saying," Levinas tells us, is a "first discourse" that has nothing to do with the communication of a message or an idea or bit of information; it is signification itself, sans the apophantic "as" structure (this as that) that underwrites any hermeneuti cal understanding within the context of the world. The address as such, in other words, is the specifically rhetorical gesture that is effaced by both "rhetorical hermeneutics" and "hermeneutical rhetoric." The only content carried by the address is an interdiction against murder: "You shall not kill." Pace Burke (again), Levinas describes this as an ex/ra-symbolic "experience" of the negative, which operates not as a "simple rule of conduct" but as "the principle of discourse itself," the very condition for jac 29.3 (2009)</page><page sequence="2">596 jac the language relation (Difficult 8-9). The interdiction against murder is simultaneously an invitation to speak, in other words?which means, very specifically, to remain in relation with an otherness that can be neither assimilated nor sublated. What will interest us here, however, is that according to Levinas this greeting that opens the space of the ethical relation takes place?first of all, if not exclusively?among human "brothers." The primary subject of ethics in Levinas's radical rearticulation is both fraternal and human. Neither the "feminine alterity" nor "the animal"2 are capable of the Saying that Levinas describes, which means that neither the wagging tail nor the feminine welcome quite cuts it in terms of ethical responsiveness: the animal is "without the brain needed to universalize maxims and drives," and the "feminine alterity" is situated in a pre-ethical zone that lacks the transcendence of language. It's certainly possible to zoom in on what we could describe as Levinas' s grotesque depictions of women and of animals as a way to dismiss his notion of ethics along with the politics it appears to imply. And yet, as Derrida notes in several places, it is not necessary to conflate the "dimension of femininity" with an empirical human being of the "feminine sex" (Adieu 44)?indeed in Totality and Infinity, Levinas explicitly asks us notto (157-5 8). The place of "feminine alterity" could be occupied by either partner, male or female, at the threshold of the dwelling place called "home." Furthermore, though the language of E.L. demonstrates a consistent and disappointing allergy to the elle, as Derrida puts it in "At This Very Moment," it is not necessary to conclude that Levinasian ethics demonstrates that same allergy. The question of "the animal" is more problematic, however, in that Levinas himself declares that his notion of ethics arises precisely in the "gap between the animal and the human" (Totality 149). The human face, which "resists identification" and calls me to my responsibility, Levinas writes in an early essay, "differs from an animal's head in which a being, in its brutish dumbness, is not yet in touch with itself5 ("Philosophy" 55). Indeed, Pat J. Gehrke argues compellingly that "the distinction between animal and human is, and must be, for Levinas first and foremost an ethical distinction" (429). Still, in a late interview Levinas leaves open the possibility for "a more specific analysis" of the ethical potential of "the animal"?and that will be the focus of our inquiry. Though we will need</page><page sequence="3">Diane Davis 597 to examine very carefully what he has to say about this "gap," our goal will not be to determine whether "Mr. Levinas" himself operated on certain anthropocentric presumptions (of course, of course); our goal, rather, will be to begin the "more specific analysis" that he invites in order to determine whether his theory of ethical responsiveness might nonetheless accommo date non-human alterity. Our aim is not to blur the difference between "the human" and "the animal" but to point up again something Derrida articulated more than twenty years ago: that "drawing an oppositional limit itself blurs the difference, the differance and the differences, not only between man and animal, but among animal societies?there are an infinite number of animal societies, and within animal societies and within human society itself, so many differences" ("On Reading" 183). That is, to deconstruct this opposition is not to reduce all living creatures to an undifferentiated homogeneity but, as Geoffrey Bennington puts it, to allow "absolutely singular configurations" to become events (55). To that end, we'll embrace the play of differences that are effaced by this rude and crude dichotomy ("the human'V'the animal") and attempt to determine whether Levinasian ethics can do without it. The Last Kantian in Nazi Germany In an essay in Difficult Freedom called "The Name of a Dog, Or Natural Rights," Levinas describes the dehumanization he and his seventy prisonmates suffered in forestry commando unit number 1492, a camp for Jewish POWs in Nazi Germany where Levinas was held captive from 1940-1945. The guards, along with "the children and women who passed by and sometimes raised their eyes," Levinas writes, stripped us of our human skin. We were subhuman, a gang of apes. A small inner murmur, the strength and wretchedness of persecuted people, reminded us of our essence as thinking creatures, but we were no longer part of the world. Our comings and goings, our sorrow and laughter, illnesses and distractions, the work of our hands and the anguish of our eyes, the letters we received from France and those accepted for our families?all that passed in</page><page sequence="4">598 jac parenthesis. We were beings entrapped in their species; despite all our vocabulary, beings without language. Racism is not a biological concept; anti-Semitism is the archetype of all internment. Social aggression, itself, merely imitates this model. It shuts people away in a class, deprives them of expression and condemns them to being "signifiers without a signified" and from there to violence and fighting. How can we deliver a message about our humanity which, from behind the bars of quotation marks, will come across as anything other than monkey talk? (153) Immediately following this powerful and heart wrenching paragraph, Levinas introduces a small gift of hope and life, a gift the prisoners named "Bobby," who had wandered into their midst: And then, about halfway through our long captivity, for a few short weeks, before the sentinels chased him away, a wandering dog entered our lives. One day he came to meet this rabble as we returned under guard from work. He survived in some wild patch in the region of the camp. But we called him Bobby, an exotic name, as one does with a cherished dog. He would appear at morning assem bly and was waiting for us as we returned, jumping up and down and barking in delight. For him, there was no doubt that we were men. (153) Simultaneously touching and offensive, this little story offers some sense not only of the scandalously crushing conditions the prisoners endured but also of Emmanuel Levinas's anthropocentrism. Levinas's tender depiction of this "cherished dog" suggests that he is the sole creature willing (even eager) to welcome "this rabble" without discrimination, the singular "existent" willing to testify, and enthusiasti cally, to the irreducible value of the other.3 And yet, Levinas reads Bobby's welcoming reception as confirmation of the very human/subhuman dichotomy that underwrites the tragic politics of the camp, as confirmation, that is, of a troublingly simplistic opposition between mere creatures and "thinking creatures" endowed with language. As John Llewelyn sug gests, Levinas would consider it crucial to discern whether "Bobby merely barks or whether in doing so he can say Bonjour" (56). And it seems clear that for Levinas, Bobby's greeting, which comes from "deep within a life called animal," as Derrida has put it {Animal 12), testifies not to an ethical</page><page sequence="5">Diane Davis 599 responsiveness but to the fact that the prisoners are men?and not subhuman, like "gang of apes," or a pack of dogs.4 Levinas does not consider Bobby's "barking in delight" to be an ethical saying, in other words, but a kind of "monkey talk," not a true greeting but a citation of one (as if "bonjour" were not itself, each time, already a citation). So despite the gratitude and affection he clearly feels for Bobby, it is equally clear that Levinas does not consider the relation he shares with this canine refugee to be an ethical relation in his particular sense of that term. Instead, this exemplary relation between man and "the friend of man" confirms for him the inherently (and inestimably) higher value of the human (152), which is apparently grounded in the capacity for language and reason: Perhaps the dog that recognized Ulysses beneath his disguise on his return from the Odyssey was a forebear of our own. But no, no! There, they were in Ithaca and the Fatherland. Here, we were nowhere. This dog was the last Kantian in Nazi Germany, without the brain needed to universalize maxims and drives. He was a descendent of the dogs of Egypt. And his friendly growling, his animal faith, was born from the silence of his forefathers on the banks of the Nile. (153) The Kantian descriptor is significant and cuts both ways. Insisting on the moral duty of human kindness, Immanuel Kant concerned himself with neighborliness and the fundamental capacity of humankind to abide those of their own species?even, perhaps, to abide the inhabitants of different planets.5 In any case, Kant introduced into philosophical contemplation a somewhat alien notion of moral law, which?despite Kant's own racism and sexism?challenges long-held prejudices by extending the status of moral agency to "all rational beings," welcoming even women into the moral landscape.6 So to align Bobby with Kant in this way is to suggest, it seems, that this "wandering dog" displayed a similarly transcendent neighborliness. And yet, to propose in the second half of the very same sentence that Bobby lacks the brain power needed to "universalize maxims and drives" is to slap him (back) into alignment with the mere creatures, to situate him again on the wrong side of a devastatingly indivisible line that Kant leaves intact.</page><page sequence="6">600 jac According to Levinas, this "cherished dog" both was and was not a Kantian. He greeted the prisoners with generosity and enthusiasm, in a way that attested to their existence and value, and yet he did so stupidly, as he himself was without the capacity for reason that grounds Kant's sense of ethical action.7 You might object that Levinasian ethics is not reducible to Kantian ethics, and you would be correct to do so.8 For Kant, ethics is a duty, a very conscious and purely reasoned obligation to other rational beings that depends upon an originary freedom and that requires the capacity to universalize maxims in order to arrive at a priori knowledge and thus to discern the categorical imperative.9 For Levinas, on the other hand, ethics does not depend upon a prior freedom, nor does it take place at the level of conscious decision or logical contemplation; it involves an expropriating relation that precedes comprehension and interrupts cogni tion. Indeed, Levinas allows for no logical limits to the subject's respon sibility for the other: "The debt increases in the measures that it is paid" (Otherwise 12). Nor does he allow for any reciprocal limits: "[T]he way in which my T' is an I is something utterly singular in the world. And therefore / am responsible, and may not be concerned about whether the other is responsible for me." The absolute dissymmetry between the "I" and all the others is a "truth" Levinas acknowledges lifting from Dostoevsky. "It is his great truth:6 We are all guilty in everything in respect to all others, and I more than all the others.' This last T more than all the others' is the important thing here," Levinas writes, "even if it means in a certain sense to be an idiot" (Righteous 133). An idiot. It may be tempting, then, to consider Bobby' s allegedly deficient brain power a non-issue for Levinas; that, however, would be a mistake.10 Bobby Versus the Idiot No one has explored the connection between responsibility and idiocy (or nonunderstanding) more poignantly than Dostoevsky does in The Idiot, and no one has explored Dostoevsky's explorations through a Levinasian frame more brilliantly than Avital Ronell does in the fourth chapter of Stupidity, "The Disappearance and Returns of the Idiot." Honing in on an excessive responsibility that exceeds intentionality and hovers close to the</page><page sequence="7">Diane Davis 601 extinction of consciousness, Ronell reads Prince Myshkin as an exemplar of ethical substitution, of being-for-the-other. What will most interest us in this reading is the undeniable similarity between the Prince and the pooch, specifically in their displays of sacrificial readiness. Myshkin, Ronell writes, demonstrates ua readiness of pure exposure" reminiscent of "Abrahamic sacrifice: the sheer 'Here I am' in response to the invasive demand. But Abraham answers to God, whereas the Prince will answer to anyone." Myshkin, like Bobby, stands ready to respond without discrimination, without contemplation, without calculation. "He stands as his own lamb, ever prepared for slaughter. He stands ready, a figure of latent presence" (211). This ready stance, furthermore, indicates a problem of timing, "of when this immemorial sacrifice could take place, at what time and in whose place." Is it possible for readiness to adhere to a concept of belatedness, a slow resumption of what has already taken place? The slaughter for which the Prince stands ready could occur only after the prime of sacrificial epochality, when the dignity of the offering is nearly lost on everyone and can hardly be made in tribute to the big Other. Stripped of sacrificial grandeur, the sacrificial readiness has been somehow discounted, which is why we are faced with an idiot and not a prophet, or a poet, or even a philosopher (the gap is admittedly closing). (211) The difference between the "Here I am" of Abraham and the "Here I am" of Myshkin is one of dignity and self-possession: whereas the prophet controlled his sacrificial impulses, holding out for the Almighty's com mand, the Idiot offered himself up to anyone, anywhere, as if the sacrifice had always already occurred, without economic exchange (no ram shows up) and immemorially?as if the best he could do in the present would be to testify to it with an unchecked exuberance roughly analogous to "jumping up and down and barking in delight." Significantly, Myshkin's extraordinary responsiveness has nothingto do with the stamina that accompanies great health; on the contrary, he is chronically ill and acutely aware of the irreparable claims body has upon him: "there is no phase of attestable overcoming, for the disease, experienced in the mode of silent chronicity, is always with the Idiot, even where it refrains from proposing signs and symptoms or ceases to</page><page sequence="8">602 jac substitute itself for perception and mime consciousness." An epi leptic, "he walks about, ever in anticipation of an attack." Ronell proposes that "idiocy and epilepsy reinforce each other in the novel, as if to emphasize the impossible separation of domains, notably, where the body ends" (182? 83). However, his illness is not the point so much as the pointer: "illness, if that is what it is, exhorts the body to reveal something of itself," Ronell writes. Indeed, her analysis articulates a solidly Levinasian insight about the corporal constraints of cognitive prowess: where body starts, knowl edge stops. Body, the animal life upon which any capacity for reason would depend, is also the end of reason. Nonknowledge defines body, any body, even "your" body. "There is no epistemological stronghold, no scientific comfort or medical absolute by which to grasp your body once and for all, as if it were ever merely itself, once and for all" (180). So though "[ijdiocy materializes itself in a kind of negative corporeal stylization," Ronell writes, "it points to the generality of a human predica ment: idiocy has something to do with the nearly existential fact of being stuck with a body" (180). Your material incarnation is the site of a passivity more ancient than the active/passive dichotomy; it' s the very condition for exposure, susceptibility, vulnerability?and therefore for responsivity. This is Levinas's singular insight: it is precisely to the extent that you are an embodied creature that you are both an ethical subject and "in a certain sense an idiot." Ethics involves "a responsibility not resting on any free commitment," Levinas writes, "that is, a responsibility without freedom, a responsibility of the creature; a responsibility of one who comes too late in being to avoid supporting it in its entirety" ("Substitution" 91). Levinas calls this responsibility of the creature that is prior to freedom "human fraternity itself (Otherwise 116). Nonmortal beings?fairies, elves, gods?have nothing to do with Levinasian ethics, which is grounded, first of all, in the predicament of embodiment, in an im-mediate exposure at the level of the skin, "such that irritability, susceptibility or exposedness to wounds and outrage characterizes its passivity, more passive still than the passivity of affects" (Otherwise 108).11 Body is the site of proximity, where "the subject is reached or touched without the mediation of the logos," Levinas writes (121). There is no logic or representational power that could catch up to this immediate (as in non-mediated) contact, which amounts to "an unconditional Yes... a Yes older than naive spontaneity"</page><page sequence="9">Diane Davis 603 ("Substitution" 93; see also Otherwise 121), and which leaves any creature somewhat stupid?transcendentally stupid, as Ronell puts it? ultimately deficient, flawed, wanting. And that is the ungrounding ground of Levinasian ethics, which would seem to bode well for Bobby. But that is not the case, at least not from Levinas's perspective. In a late interview, for example, he defines creatureliness as "pure being," emphasizing that the human is defined by its capacity to break with its animal impulses: [ W]hat I want to emphasize is that the human breaks with pure being, which is always a persistence in being. This is my principle thesis. A being is something that is attached to being, to its own being. That is Darwin's idea. The being of animals is a struggle for life. A struggle for life without ethics. It is a question of might.... However, with the appearance of the human?and this is my entire philoso phy?there is something more important than my life, and that is the life of the other. That is unreasonable. Man is an unreasonable animal. ("Paradox" 172) It is obviously of some consequence whether "the life of the other?the life that is more important to "the human" than that human's own life? refers to any other or only to another human other, but more on that below. For now, let's stick to the "break" that grounds Levinas's "entire philosophy." He has announced it before. Indeed, some twenty years prior to this interview, Levinas proposes in Totality and Infinity that the "gap between the animal and the human"?even, presumably, between the canine and the idiot?comes down to this: whereas the animal lives complacently "in itself," the specifically human animal is "capable of living for the Other and of being on the basis of the Other who is exterior to him" (149). The Other is exterior to me to the extent that he or she gives me the "idea of infinity" and so remains absolutely inassimilable, resistant to my powers of comprehension. "The idea of infinity" could not come from me alone but "occurs in the relationship with the other. The idea of infinity is the social relationship" ("Philosophy" 55). Being-for-the-other, according to Levinas, is a strictly human predicament, but it is not a function of reason. Self-sacrificing generosity is not logical; it makes no sense. The sacrificial readiness that Levinas calls "substitution" is attributable neither to pure being (creatureliness or biology) nor to pure reason, as Kant would</page><page sequence="10">604 jac have it, but owes something to "human fraternity itself," as Levinas puts it above, which is utterly passive and uniquely human, and which the Idiot seems to have in spades. "Noted for his graciousness and courtesy," the Prince simultaneously demonstrates a certain "social defenselessness," Ronell notes. He "caves without cowering, folds or bows according to an exigency that disrupts any priority of self; indeed, "the profusion of courtesies offers up a sense of destitution that he embodies before the other." When the Prince is "laughed at," he laughs along with his persecutors, admitting that he would have done the same thing in their place. "Precisely," Ronell adds. "Without the intention or means of dispossessing his addressees, he is in their place, always, without exception." To the extent that he puts himself in the place of the other, Ronell proposes, "the Idiot signals an exemplary instance of Kantian ethicity"; however, the ethical duty, an activity dictated by pure reason, is undercut almost immediately by the detection of a radical passivity: Despite it all, Myshkin, even in the ultimate scene of blank stupor, is maintained as the guarantor of unbreachable responsibility. Caressing the murderer in an effort to soothe him, Myshkin displays what it means to be responsible for the other, devoted to the other, even unconsciously, without "doing": it is an action without doing, an ethically maintained passivity. He slips into the other's anguish. Putting the self in place of another necessarily implies, for the modern subject, a rupture in identity, a self-departure or significant interruption; however, the Idiot's manner of consistently extenuat ing himself before the other points to something else. His place has been designated from the start as being open to displacement, marked as it is by the apparent contingency of random encounter. ... [H]e keeps himself insistently out of place, with no place of his own, always at once host to the other and also, oddly, retaining the bearing of docile guest. (205) Both host and hostage to the other, the Prince is not so much free to offer up his place as he is originarily displaced; despite his wealth and station, he enjoys no home base but instead "exists" in the mode of giving way, somewhere between being and nonbeing.12The substitution attributed to Myshkin does not come down to ability or aptitude, to duty or will, but to</page><page sequence="11">Diane Davis 605 a fundamental homelessness and vulnerability, an inability simply to be in himself or for himself. The way in which Myshkin performs this being-one for-the-other is not so much Kantian, then, as Levinasian. And/but given Levinas's category distinction, whereas the Prince's soothing caresses indicate that he has slipped "into the other's anguish," Bobby's "barking in delight" can only indicate that he is, in himself, delighted. The Prince embraces his irreparable deficiency without hesitation or limitation, demonstrating an exorbitant responsibility without freedom and unconstrained by empirical guilt or capacity. Ever poised for the sacrifice, Myshkin answers to anyone?"Here I am"?and apologizes to everyone: "Being an idiot means always having to say you're sorry," Ronell writes (215). "A sorry being," he apologizes even to those who persecute him, absorbing injury and assuming responsibility, because, "having no under standing," he could not have been responsible, could not have acted responsibly: The logic is awry: he is the cause because, in the end, there's no possible way for him to have been the cause?he can't help it, he didn't understand, he was almost an idiot. Because he cannot take responsibility as a conscious, sufficient subject, because he cannot be present to a task the failure of which he stands accused, he is responsible for it all. The idiot has to apologize for everything because there is nothing for which he is not responsible. The judgment has already been made prior to any act, and it orders the idiot to live by the purity of an irreversible prejudice. Precisely because I, as an idiot, cannot be a fully responsible being, precisely because my consciousness is punctured, I must and do take full responsibility. I take responsibility for the darkness, the lapse, the fever, and the delirium. This is why, always and ever, "I am sorry." (216) It is because "he cannot take responsibility as a conscious, sufficient subject" that he must take full responsibility for everything and for everyone. And again, this is not simply the peculiar predicament of Dostoevsky's Idiot; according to a careful reading of Levinas, this is the "nearly existential" predicament of any ethical subject: responsibility precedes empirical evidence of guilt. You are responsible (even) for not being able to be responsible.</page><page sequence="12">606 jac Significantly, however, the entire weight of the Idiot's ethical liability hinges, Ronell points out, on the opening provided by the "almost." In order to say he is sorry, [Myshkin] has had to refer to himself as someone who was almost an idiot, which modifies the accusers' sentence. The "almost" is what engages the absolute; it is only because he was almost an idiot that he assumes absolute respon sibility. If he had been a total idiot, as we now freely say, he would have been home free as concerns the assumption of ethical liability. The rhetorical force that renders him a responsible subject lies within the "almost"?the crevice or opening that allows for con sciousness and decision. (217) It's because he was almost an idiot that "there can be no refuge, no ducking out as concerns the reach and breach of ethicity," Ronell writes. "It is because he posits himself as having been almost an idiot that he can? he must?take total responsibility" (217). And here again we are faced with Levinas's proverbial line in the sand, the simple opposition on which he insists between the mere creature (without the brains to universalize maxims) and the "thinking creature," a line that holds even if the thinking creature should turn out to be "in a certain sense an idiot." If the human animal is the unreasonable animal, his or her unreason ableness nonetheless depends upon a prior capacity for reason?without it, the mere creature would be a total idiot and therefore home free, defined by instinctual reactions and not by true responsiveness, by react-ability and not response-ability. According to Levinas, Bobby is not, finally, the last Kantian in Nazi Germany; he is instead a crude imitation, a "cherished dog" aping the last Kantian. "There is a proto-ethical moment in his gestures," Calarco writes, "but no ethics or politics proper" (58). Or, as David Clark puts it, "although he looks like a Kantian and sounds like a Kantian, and has a humanizing effect on the prisoners that is explicitly called Kantian, he is not Kantian. How could he be? ' [T]he dog is a dog. Literally a dog!"' (88). Levinas does insist that "there is a transcendence in the animal!" (152); however, that transcendence involves not the animal's singularity of ex-pression, kath 'auto (according to itself alone) but his or her capacity to testify to "the freedom and singularity of the human" (Calarco 5 8)---which itself depends, it seems, upon the presump</page><page sequence="13">Diane Davis 607 tion of this scandalously indivisible line between the mere creature and the thinking creature. It is not clear to me that Bobby's delighted barking demonstrates an "animal complacency in oneself." Nor is it clear that his barking and wagging are any more reducible to "signifiers without a signified" than any (other) speech act. No anthropomorphizing is required, I don't think, to begin to suspect that this homeless creature' s determination to show up for the prisoners?both to greet them warmly in the morning and to welcome them back enthusiastically in the evening?may indicate that he is "capable of living for the Other and of being on the basis of the Other who is exterior to him" {Totality 149). As Peter Atterton observes, "Bobby's 'friendly barking' is in response to the encounter with the Other who is Levinas himself in this instance" (57). Why insist?and with such certitude, basing an "entire philosophy" on it?that not a single nonhuman animal has a sense of responsibility to the Other, not even "to their offspring or to humans they guard or guide?" Lleweleyn adds (Middle 57). Why is it necessary that this sense of responsibility prior to freedom, of obligation to "the life of the other," be absolutely unique to the human animal? Instances of domestic and wild animals performing what appear to be spectacular (contrary both to instinct and to reason) acts of self-sacrificing generosity are well-documented: a grown lion protecting an infant monkey it just orphaned, a crow providing food and protection for a stray kitten, an elephant holding vigil 24/7 for a beloved dog recovering from surgery, a 130-year-old giant tortoise adopting a baby hippo, a grown tiger nursing orphaned piglets, a rescued Greyhound taking it upon herself to welcome and nurture every wounded mammal admitted to a wildlife sanctuary, and so on. Instances of all sorts of so-called "lower" animals saving humans, often at their own peril, are as numerous. So what is at stake in this move to shut animals "away in a class," to deprive "them of expression," and to condemn "them to being' signifiers without a signified'"? What is at stake, in Clark's words, "in Levinas's desire to seal Bobby up in the prison of his species, lest he say more or do more than what is anthropocentrically allotted him"? "For what is Bobby doing," Clark continues, "when, by Levinas's own account, he so gaily greets the prisoners and recognizes them as 'other,' that is, as 'men'? More: what is 'language' if it is not the</page><page sequence="14">608 jac wagging of a tail, and 'ethics' if it is not the ability to greet one [an]other and to dwell together as others?" ( 90-91). Le Visage d'Autrui You might imagine that even if Levinas cannot accept Bobby as an ethical subject with responsibilities, he will at the very least grant that an ethical subject would be responsible to and for Bobby. Given Levinas's insistence that my responsibility to the other is radically nonreciprocal, he should at least grant that "the life of the other," which is more important to "the human" than that human's own life, could be a nonhuman other?a "cherished dog," for example. But that does not appear to be the case, either. There is no indication that Levinas, the thinker par excellence of the address as such, receives Bobby's greeting as an address, as an address that requires a response or that calls for response-ability {Animal 12). There is no indication, that is, that Bobby's own vulnerability and destitution provoke in Levinas an interruption of self and an obligation to respond, a sense of responsibility to this homeless creature who is ultimately "chased away" from the partial shelter of a "wild patch" inside the camp.13 Why not? Because Bobby's "face" is not human, because it is at the very most a secondary "face," a "face" that shows up only analogously, as a weak reflection of the human "face." It's crucial to understand that in Levinasian parlance the "face" is not the front of the head, nor is it the effect of routine figural operations (prosopopoeia, apostrophe, metonymy, etc.). "Face," for Levinas, has nothing to do with the color of the eyes or the size of the ears or how much the other resembles, say, the mother?according to him, while you're focusing on any of that, you are not encountering a "face." "Face" names that which interrupts thematizing consciousness in a kind of reversal of the gesture of prosopopoeia, a depropriative interruption in which the figure of the face is suddenly divested of the meaning it is charged with transporting. Escaping all representation, "the face," Levinas writes, "is the very collapse of phenomenality. Not because it is too brutal to appear, but because in a sense it is too weak, non-phenomenon because less than a phenomenon. The disclosing of a face is nudity, nonform, abandon of self,</page><page sequence="15">Diane Davis 609 ageing, dying, more naked than nudity. It is poverty, skin with wrinkles" (Otherwise 88). What one encounters in the "face to face" is a trace of alterity undefeated by the negative, a trace of infinity in a "materiality more material than all matter" (108); what one encounters is the other's finitude, her exposedness or nakedness?that is to say, both her extreme vulner ability and her sheer ungraspableness (91). "Face," in Levinas, names the inassimilable alterity of the other, and the encounter with it provokes an interruption in identification and cognition: "The way in which the other presents himself, exceeding the idea of the other in me, we here name face" (Totality 50). The face puts me into relation with what I can neither assimilate nor ditch, overwhelming my powers of comprehension and so demolishing my delusions of "intersubjectivity." The world of "things" is naked, too, Levinas acknowledges, inasmuch as things or objects are completely opaque. Having no light of their own, they require interpretation (adornment), a borrowed light: "To disclose a thing is to clarify it by forms," Levinas writes, "to find for it a place in the whole by apperceiving its functions or its beauty." The work of science and art, he suggests, is to disclose by clothing, to take us beyond the mere perception of things by adorning them in signification. But the face is not a thing, so the relation with the face "is entirely different," Levinas says, it consists in entering into a relationship with a nudity disengaged from every form, but having meaning by itself, kath' auto, signify ing before we have projected light upon it, appearing not as a privation on the ground of an ambivalence of values . . . but as an always positive value. Such a nudity is the face. (Totality 74) When I face the other?the sensible, visible, identifiable other?the Other looks back: "the eyes break through the mask," Levinas writes; "the language of the eyes, impossible to dissemble. The eye does not shine; it speaks" (Totality 66). The nakedness of the face is beyond my power and possibility; I cannot clothe and so clarify it by giving it form because it has already broken through all form, signifying itself not across some recog nizable generality but by/as itself (kath' auto), in excess of generalizable form and without reference to a system. Nothing, no possession or attribute or concept links me to the face of the Other?to Autrui?who, in exceeding my powers (of comprehension), calls me into question. As a</page><page sequence="16">610 jac phenomenon (a thing-like product of the said), the face offers itself up to my vision, makes itself available to my grasp, to my powers of comprehen sion. But "in its epiphany, in expression, the sensible, still graspable, turns into a total resistance to the grasp" (Totality 197). The expression of the face signifies extreme proximity, "an immediacy older than the abstracts of nature" through which "I" effect a distance; it signifies a "contact with the other," an affection by the other that precedes comprehension (Otherwise 86). To the extent that it signifies as a surplus of sociality (radical exposedness), the face "speaks." The relation with the face is already a language-relation, a saying or an address, which is why in the encounter with the face "it is necessary to speak of something," Levinas writes, "of the rain and fine weather," of anything at all, "but to speak, to respond" (Ethics 88). The Saying of the face comes through as a rhetorical imperative, in other words, an obligation to respond that holds the "I" and the other in a nearness so excruciatingly close that s/he touches me, affects me, overwhelming my powers of cognition. Levinas calls this language-relation a "first discourse" or simply "conversation" (entre tieri). Language begins in the encounter with the face: "in its silence, it calls you. Your reaction to the face is a response. Not just a response, but a responsibility_Language does not begin with the signs that one gives, with words. Language is above all the fact of being addressed ... which means the saying much more than the said" ("Paradox" 169-70). As pure affective appeal, the face subjects one to the scandal of obligation in which ego, finding itself compelled to respond, is stripped of its sense of self-mastery and spontaneity. Conversation is the relation with "an addressor whose addressee I am, and about whom I know nothing," as Jean-Fran9ois Lyotard puts it in his reading of Levinas, "except that he or she situates me upon the addressee instance." The violence of the revelation is in the ego's expulsion from the addressor instance, from which it managed its work of enjoyment, power, and cognition. It is the scandal of an I displaced onto a you instance. . . .By turning the I into its you, the other makes him or herself master, and turns the I into his or her hostage. (Differend 110-11)</page><page sequence="17">Diane Davis 611 And Levinas insists that this displacement, inherent in the language relation, is a re-currence of what has always already occurred. According to him, I am/is a subject to the precise extent that "I" respond(s). It is in this giving over of the "I" to the other that "I" am/is given at all: "the subject" is the response to alterity, "an accusative that derives from no nominative" (Otherwise 11). So for Levinas, there are "things," which require linguistic cover to have any significance at all, and then there is "the face of the Other" (le visage d'Autrui), which gives its own meaning, kath 'auto, by shedding all representational form and therefore calling me and my sense of spontaneity and self-sufficiency into question. This is pretty much an either/or for Levinas, he offers no other possibility, so nonhuman animals will have to line up with the rocks or with the faces.14 In a 1986 interview, graduate students from the University or Warwick asked Levinas, straight up, which is it? "But is there something distinctive about the human face which, for example, sets it apart from that of an animal?" And Levinas equivocates: One cannot entirely refuse the face of an animal. It is via the face that one understands, for example, a dog. Yet the priority here is not found in the animal, but in the human face. We understand the animal, the face of an animal, in accordance with Dasein. The phenomenon of the face is not in its purest form in the dog. In the dog, in the animal, there are other phenomena. For example, the force of nature is pure vitality. It is more this which characterizes the dog. But it also has a face. (169) So Bobby, for example, appears to line up with the faces, but only after a distinction is made between primary and secondary faces, and only after the face has suddenly, inexplicably become a "phenomenon." The face is what primarily characterizes "the human," but it is only secondarily what characterizes "the animal," which therefore only sortofhas a face, a face that cannot be "entirely" refused. What primarily characterizes "the animal" is not its face but its animality, its "pure being" or "pure vitality," from which "the human" by definition breaks. But if, in my encounter with the face of the Other, what calls to me and commands me is precisely that other's material exposedness and vulnerability, which is to say that other's</page><page sequence="18">612 jac mortality or finitude, why would this call be less compelling coming in from so-called "pure" corporeality? If what calls to me in the face of the Other is not a power or capability, in other words?not the power to speak or the capacity to think, for example?but precisely an inability not to suffer, a not-being-able to not suffer, to not be vulnerable, a "possibility without power, a possibility of the impossible," as Derrida puts it (Animal 28), then wouldn't this call come in all the more intensely from a "pure vitality"? Apparently not: "The absolutely foreign alone can instruct me. And the absolutely foreign can only be man," Levinas writes (Totality 73). The interviewers try again: "According to your analysis, the com mandment 'Thou shalt not kill' is revealed by the human face; but is the commandment not also expressed in the face of an animal? Can an animal be considered as the other that must be welcomed? Or is it necessary to possess the possibility of speech to be a 'face' in the ethical sense?" And this time Levinas's response is even more puzzling because now, contrary to everything he has said since Totality andInfinity\ he situates the "face" in a rhetoric of rights: "I cannot say at what moment you have the right to be called 'face'" (171). He then reinforces the previous ambiguity: "The human face is completely different and only afterwards do we discover the face of an animal. I don't know if a snake has a face. I can't answer that question. A more specific analysis is needed" (172). Proposing that what attracts us to a dog is perhaps "his child-like character," Levinas again shifts the relation with the animal out of ethical territory. The interviewers respond astutely by sharpening the focus of their question, which is also our question: "If animals do not have faces in an ethical sense, do we have obligations towards them? And if so, where do they come from?" Levinas: It is clear that, without considering animals as human beings, the ethical extends to all living beings. We do not want to make an animal suffer needlessly and so on. But the prototype of this is human ethics. Vegetarianism, for example, arises from the transference to animals of the idea of suffering. The animal suffers. It is because we, as human, know what suffering is that we can have this obligation. (172) So the face of a nonhuman animal does not itself issue to me the command "you shall not kill"; it is only by analogy, by an identification that comes</page><page sequence="19">Diane Davis 613 down to an anthropomorphism, that one can experience responsibility toward a nonhuman animal.15 This is problematic on so many levels that it is difficult to catch enough traction to begin to respond. Everything Levinas has said up to this point about the face describes it as that which interrupts any possibility for identification or analogy. So if "the animal" has a face by a certain analogical movement grounded in the encounter with the face of "the human," then the animal does not have a face in Levinas's sense of the term; indeed, the human does not have a face in Levinas's sense of the term. Either the clean opposition Levinas is pushing between "the animal" and "the human" is bogus or else?or else: Levinas's entire ethics of the face is bogus. Or both. And I do not want to discount completely the possibility of the latter. It would be one thing if Levinas were simply contradicting himself here, but it's not that simple. Indeed, in "The Ethical Importance of Being Human," Gerhke argues?correctly, I think?that "Levinas is more than consistent to be skeptical about the face of the dog or the snake and to claim that all ethical responsibilities for the nonhuman other emerge only as a resultant of the uniquely human ethics that is before being" (435). Though I can't do it justice here, Gehrke's argument runs something like this: 1) that for Levinas "only in the other human can a trace of the Infinite Otherness shatter being-for-itself' (433); 2) that "the human" is for Levinas "separated and bound in a fraternity of alterity before there is any organizing principle, idea, or shared quality that would create the species or the genus" (434); and so 3) that "the only esse of the human is responsibility, and this essence precedes all ontological characteristics. Responsibility is prior even to consciousness and being," Gehrke contin ues, "but it is the hallmark of human being" (435). In this short essay, Gehrke manages to articulate the internal coherence of Levinas's particu lar style of humanism. And yet, a nagging question remains: Why then is it not within the realm of possibility, no way no how, to describe an animal, any animal not of the human species?say, Bobby?as "human" in Levinas's sense? If "the human" precedes "all ontological characteris tics" and so any possibility of genus-species analytics, why is it out of the question that an existent later classified as a different species might indeed be "separated and bound in a fraternity [or sorority] of alterity" that precedes and exceeds that classification? Gerhke is correct, I believe, that</page><page sequence="20">614 jac there is no internal contradiction here; a humanist perspective rules Levinas's philosophy from the ground up. Put differently: Levinas has an anthropocentric blind spot the size of a Mack Truck. But then again, who doesn't? What I would like to propose is that the vast majority of Levinas's descriptions of "the face" depict an interruption coming in from the irreparable exposedness of corporeal existence, from "a materiality more material than all matter," and therefore that "the face" could not be restricted to whatever it is that Levinas calls "the human," itself based, top to bottom, on a simple opposition to "the animal." Clark proposes, for example, that "Bobby's face cannot be entirely refused, not because there is something residually 'human' or 'prehuman' about it, but precisely because of its nonhuman excess, because that face, screened though it is through Levinas's axiomatic discourse, constitutes a 'yes' that is not a 'yes,' a 'yes,' belonging uniquely to the animal, to this animal, and given freely to the human prisoners" (91). That is, Bobby's "yes," which is not the viwd"yes," comes in, as Derrida says with a different animal in mind, from the "wholly other, more other than any other, which they call an animal" (Animal 11). Neither inertly thing-like nor complacently in himself, Bobby faces those "exterior" to him, greets them, in short regards them: both acknowledges and demonstrates concern for them. And yet, even when Levinas offers an account of Bobby in "The Name of a Dog," he takes no account of the fact that this animal addresses him, responds to him, and therefore calls to him, obligating him. Bobby and the Pussycat In The Animal That Therefore I Am, Derrida proposes that there are "two types of discourse, two positions of knowledge, two grand forms of theoretical or philosophical treaties regardingthe animal." The first type, with which we are all familiar, is "signed by people who have no doubt seen, observed, analyzed, reflected on the animal, but who have never been seen by the animal. Their gaze has never intersected with that of an animal directed at them." Or else, if they had been "seen furtively by the animal one day, they took no (thematic, theoretical, or philosophical)</page><page sequence="21">Diane Davis 615 account of it" (13). That is, the disturbance of the encounter, of an animal Other looking back, did not register as a disturbance for these thinkers. In "Phenomena and Enigma," Levinas himself warns that "disturbance disturbs order without troubling it seriously. It enters in so subtle a way that unless we retain it, it has already withdrawn. It insinuates itself, withdraws before entering. It remains only for him who would like to take it up. Otherwise it has already restored the order it troubled?Someone rang, and there is no one at the door: did anyone ring?" (66). The thinkers of this first type of discourse on "the animal" either have never been disturbed by being seen by an animal or else they did not wish to "retain" the disturbance. "They neither wanted nor had the capacity to draw any systematic consequence," Derrida writes, "from the fact that an animal could, facing them, look at them, clothed or naked, and in a word, without a word, address them ... from down there, from a wholly other origin" (13). For such an "experience"?if we can call it that?would surely have "obliged them to recognize, at the moment of address," Derrida proposes, "that this was their affair, their lookout [que cela les regardait]" (14). And it was maybe Levinas's affair most of all, or it is at least tempting to think so, since he is the one who assumed responsibility for producing so moving and concrete a discourse on the depropriating force of the address, the greeting, the saying. The second type of discourse on the animal, Derrida says, would be signed by poets or prophets "who admit to taking upon themselves the address that an animal addresses to them"; however, he knows of "no statutory representation" of this second type. It is instead his intention to offer one, to follow "the traces of this 'wholly other they call 'animal'" (14). To this end, Derrida describes an encounter with "the absolute other," an encounter that takes place every morning when his "little cat"? not a figural cat but "a real cat, truly, believe me, a little cat" (6)?follows him into the bathroom to request breakfast but then "demands to leave said bathroom as soon as it (or she) sees me naked, ready for everything and resolved to make her wait" (13). Derrida's insistence that "it is a real cat" and not a conceptual generality is meant to "mark its unsubstitutable singularity," the fact that he is trying to talk, obviously in figures and concepts, about a living being, a mortal being, that cannot be reduced to a figure or concept:</page><page sequence="22">616 jac When it responds to its name (whatever "respond" means, and that will be our question), it doesn't do so as the exemplar of a species called "cat," even less so of an "animal" genus or kingdom. It is true that I identify it as a male or female cat. But even before that identification, it comes to me as this irreplaceable living being that one day enters my space, into this place where it can encounter me, see me, even see me naked. (9) What happens in this encounter: not simply that one naked animal sees another naked animal but that one naked animal sees another naked animal seeing him naked, seeing his nakedness. The other animal looks back, regards Derrida, from a point of view unknown to him, from "the point of view of the absolute other" (11). And Derrida cannot not take it up: Nothing can ever rob me of the certainty that what we have here is an existence that refuses to be conceptualized [rebelled a tout concept]. And a mortal existence, for from the moment that it has a name, its name survives it. It signs its potential disappearance. Mine also, and that disappearance, from this moment to that, fort/da, is announced each time that, with or without nakedness, one of us leaves the room. (9) What is exposed to Derrida in the instant that he sees this "little cat" looking at him, seeing him naked, is her nakedness, her exposedness?that is, her mortality, her inability not to suffer. Here, in the face-to-face, Derrida is addressed by another mortal, not a human mortal but an absolutely other sort of mortal, who responds to her name, who responds, that is, to the call of an other.16 Let me just note that when Derrida describes this other as "a real cat," he is citing chapter eleven from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, which consists of a single sentence: "And it really was a kitten, after all." Or, as a French translation puts it: "and, after all, it really was a little black pussycat" (Animal 7). So when Derrida wants to point to an "irreplaceable living being," to that which exceeds language's awesome powers of representation?he cites the language of another, in this case a poet who is no longer living or responding. And, if I may now cite Ronell, "this is by no means an atypical gesture" (Crack Wars 29). All language</page><page sequence="23">Diane Davis 617 is defined by this power of repetition in alterity, by its capacity to be ripped from one context and remixed or repurposed in another: a sign that could only be used once would not be a sign. Speech is essentially repeatable, as Derrida taught us years ago, and even what is said only once, only here and only now, is made possible by its repeatability, which is to say by its impurity. There is not first of all an intentional subject saying what she means and meaning what she says in the present, and then the rush of impurities, deviations, and delays brought on by writing. The speaking subject is already an effect of iterability and so of repeatability?that is, of a kind of imitation or simulation. If "monkey talk" involves speaking from "behind the bars of quotation marks," then that is one thing that humans share with monkeys. Signifiers point to other signifiers and not to signifieds; after Derrida, few understand the implications of that better than Levinas?which makes the dichotomy that he marks over and over in "The Name of a Dog" all the more puzzling. And disappointing. Though we can't be certain that he is not perversely inscribing his "whole talk within a reading of Lewis Carroll," Derrida tells us (7), he nonetheless insists that "my real cat is not Alice's little cat," is not the cat "who speaks in Alice in Wonderland" (8, 7). Why? Because Derrida is "not about to cone lude, upon wakening, as Alice did, that one cannot speak with a cat on the pretext that it doesn't reply or that it always replies the same thing." Everything that I am about to entrust to you no doubt comes back to asking you to respond to me, you, to me, reply to me concerning what it is to respond. If you can. The said question of the said animal in its entirety comes down to knowing not whether the animal speaks but whether one can know what respond means. And how to distinguish a response from a reaction. (8) In chapter twelve of Through the Looking Glass, Alice complains that whatever you say to kittens, their reply is always the same: they purr. They don't help you out by purring for "yes" and mewing for "no," or by following any other sort of rule. Because they always purr, you can never be sure whether a kitten's purr means "yes" or "no." "But how can you talk with a person," Alice asks, "if they always say the same thing?" According to her (and to Descartes), you're wasting your time speaking</page><page sequence="24">jac to an animal because it doesn't really reply?not really, not ever," Derrida adds. But "isn't Alice's credulity rather incredible? She seems, at this moment at least, to believe that one can in fact discern and decide between a human yes and no. She seems confident that when it comes to man it is possible to guess whether yes or no," even after "the Cheshire Cat had told her, in the course of a scene that deserves a long meditation: 4 We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad'" (9). As if the specifically human response is fully intentional and reasonable, an authentic response irreduc ible to reaction or instinct. But inasmuch as the language-relation involves an interruption in cognition, as Levinas insists that it does, it is by definition a space of madness. Interestingly, the only specific content Levinas ever attributes to the Saying of the face is an emphatic "No" that comes through, along with an invitation to speak, as an interdiction against murder. So it is at the very instant when my powers of comprehension are interrupted that I am also commanded not to kill, neither in the figural nor the physical senses of the word (and the former is the condition for the latter). This "No" that comes through loud and clear is an interdiction first of all against murder by-identification, against the appropriation of the Other in the other; it is in that sense also an invitation to respond and so to remain in relation with what one can neither appropriate nor abdicate. If I respond by turning away, I refuse the response-ability to which I am called: that is, I respond to the Saying of the face by refusing it. No longer in the facing position, "I" instantly re-appropriate?and recover, if I'm lucky?smoothing over the disturbance, reducing the Other once again to a masterable concept, effacing his/her alterity while preserving enough of him/her for my use. That is, in turning away, "I" am "free" to speak about the other rather than with the Other, having reinstated a sense of power and spontaneity by appropriating the otherness of the other. When I am "feeling disarmed before a small mute living being," Derrida proposes (18), I might turn away, which would leave me "faced with a cat that continues to see me, to watch me leave when I turn my back on it, a cat that, from that moment on, because I no longer see it seeing me still, from behind, I therefore risk forgetting" (11). Or I could "turn away" precisely by projecting, anthropomorphizing, "overinterpreting what the cat might thus be saying to me, in its own way, what it might be suggesting</page><page sequence="25">Diane Davis 619 or simply signifying in a language of mute traces, that is to say, without words." I might, "in a word," assign "to it words it has no need of (18). Both options temporarily rescue me from this madness, from an impossible encounter with the absolute other, from this relation without power or possibility. And as Levinas never stops reminding us, turning away, either way, is always an option. Indeed, Bobby is a "wandering dog," a stray animal, previously unfamiliar to Levinas, but he is simultaneously all too familiar, all too thematizable, all too appropriable?or reappropriable. According to Levinas's own account, his encounter with Bobby does not interrupt his sense of spontaneity, is not an "experience" of ex-propriation, but instead confirms his identity, his humanity, which is based on its clean and indivisible opposition to what he, even after meeting Bobby, continues to call "the animal." Either Bobby is not other enough to be an Other for Levinas, to disturb his powers of cognition, or else Levinas does not "retain" this disturbance, does not want (or is not able) to "take it up."17 Conversely, Derrida encounters his own "little cat," the cat who lives with him and greets him every morning in the bathroom, as the "wholly other, like the every other that is every (bit) other found in such intolerable proximity that I do not as yet feel I am justified or qualified to call it my fellow, even less my brother" (12). Alluding to Levinas's insistence that as long as you are seeing the color of the eyes, you are not encountering the face of the Other, Derrida gives us a glimpse of a more radically Levinasian ethics than Levinas himself is willing to inscribe: What does this bottomless gaze offer to my sight [donne a voir]l What does it "say" to me, demonstrating quite simply the naked truth of every gaze, when that truth allows me to see and to be seen through the eyes of the other, in the seeing and not just seen eyes of the other? I am here thinking of those seeing eyes, those eyes of a seer whose color must at the same time be seen and forgotten. (12) Face to face with a "little cat," Derrida is not assured of his own identity but instead comes to question the "abyssal limit" of what is called "the human":</page><page sequence="26">620 jac As with every bottomless gaze, as with the eyes of the other, the gaze called "animal" offers to my sight the abyssal limit of the human: the inhuman or the ahuman, the ends of man, that is to say, the bordercrossing from which vantage man dares to announce himself to himself, thereby calling himself by that name that he believes he gives himself. And in these moments of nakedness, as regards the animal, everything can happen to me, I am like a child ready for the apocalypse. (12) In the face of this "small, mute, living being," Derrida loses his humanity, loses the very concept of "the human." The transcendence of this animal, its ex-pression, throws into question not only Derrida's own sense of identity and spontaneity but the putatively solid border between "the human" and "the animal," which grounds the history of philosophy from Plato to Levinas, grounds Judeo-Christian religions, grounds western culture itself.18 There is, of course, no longer any interest in debating whether there is a kind of "discontinuity, rupture, or even abyss between those who call themselves men and what so-called men, those who name themselves men, call the animal." That discussion is over, Derrida insists, "closed in advance." Anyone who would try to argue otherwise "would have to be more asinine than any beast. . . . Even the animals know that (ask Abraham's ass or ram or the living beasts that Abel offers to God: they know what is about to happen to them when men say' Here I am' to God"), Derrida writes. The discussion only becomes interesting again, and valuable, when the focus is not on whether there is "a limit that produces discontinuity," but rather on "what a limit becomes once it is abyssal, once the frontier no longer forms a single indivisible line but more than one internally divided line; once, as a result, it can no longer be traced, objectified, or counted as single and indivisible. What are the edges of a limit that grows and multiplies by feeding on an abyss?" (30-31). The discussion only becomes significant again, in other words, when it begins with the recognition that: beyond the edge of the so-called human, beyond it but by no means on a single opposing side, rather than "The Animal" or "Animal Life" there is already a heterogeneous multiplicity of the living, or more precisely (since to say 'the living' is already to say too much</page><page sequence="27">Diane Davis 621 or not enough), a multiplicity of organizations of relations between living and dead, relations of organization or lack of organization among realms that are more and more difficult to dissociate by means of the figures of the organic and inorganic, of life and/or death. (31) These relations are both intertwined and abyssal and so "can never be totally objectified," leaving no "room for any simple exteriority of one term with respect to another" (31). But this means, first of all, that it will no longer be possible to refer to "The Animal" in the singular, as if this "catch-all concept" designated every living nonhuman thing, from a blind protozoon to a "little cat," or an orangutan. But humans will keep doing it anyway, Derrida predicts, and when one does, he will be uttering "an asinanity [betise]" which itself should confirm "not only the animality that he is disavowing but his complicit, continued, and organized involvement in a veritable war of the species" (31). It is no accident that it is at the very moment when Levinas is pushed by his interviewers to the point of having to differentiate between a dog and a snake that he suddenly becomes incapable of responding: "I don't know if a snake has a face. I can't answer that question." He offers a response that is "an admission of nonresponse," Derrida writes, "an admission that he is incapable of responding to this very question and of answering for this question on the animal, concerning the face of the animal." But this response in the form of a nonresponse is human. Quite human, all too human. No animal at all, Levinas implies, would admit in the same way to the incapacity to answer what is in sum the question of responding: for to have a face is to be able to respond or answer, by means of the "Here I am," before the other and for the other. . . . And in responding that he can't respond, Levinas says, "Here I am"; he responds, but by admitting that he can't respond to the question of knowing what a face is, namely, of knowing what responding is, and he can thus no longer answer for his whole discourse on the face. (108-09) And Levinas's inability to be response-able, in this case, Derrida suggests, calls into question "the whole legitimacy of the discourse and ethics of the 'face' of the other."</page><page sequence="28">622 jac And yet, what else has Derrida done but both challenge and simulta neously reconfirm its legitimacy? What he learns in the face of the "wholly other," the "little cat," is that there is no solid and indivisible line between "the human" and "the animal," which means that there is no such thing as "the human" or "the animal" as such, in the singular. So though it may indeed be the case that "the absolutely foreign alone can instruct me," it could not be the case that "the absolutely foreign can only be man" (Totality 73). The anthropocentric presumptions apparent in Levinas's texts and interviews do not necessarily sink the ship of Levinasian ethics, which nonetheless stands in need of certain deconstructive correctives that Levinas himself would never have approved and that may well have "apocalyptic" implications. Obviously, we have only just begun the "more specific analysis" that Levinas, to his credit, invites. And it could be significant for rhetorical studies if?following after Derrida, who is following after the animals?scholars in the field would begin to question this distinction, this limit, this border that is so taken for granted between the authentic response and the mere reaction. This all too simple distinction is frequently the basis on which rhetorical studies, too, draws its boundaries and establishes its alibis. If the rhetorical imperative, the obligation to respond and so to assume response-ability, is situated, as Levinas says (without calling it rhetorical), priorto consciousness?priorto commitment or will or the cultural norms of politesse?then how is it possible to distinguish this response clearly and definitively from instinct or mere reaction? And how certain is it that "mere" is an acceptable or justifiable qualifier here? If the line between response and reaction cannot be "traced, objectified, or counted as single and indivisible," if it, too, feeds on an abyss, what kind of (apocalyptic) implications does that have, in the field, for our rhetorics of agency and community? If it is fair to suggest that the Saying of the face at the very least involves persuasion without a rhetorician, and that the response at the very least involves a preconscious and so precognitive (re)action, then is it still possible to contend that at the center of the "rhetorical situation" there stands a knowing/speaking/responding subject who understands herself and the other (at least whether the other replies with a "yes" or a "no") and communicates that understanding, sometimes with eloquence and grace? Is it still possible, that is, to contend that the Prince is endowed</page><page sequence="29">Diane Davis 623 with rhetorical agency, but not the pooch? Or is it not time, past time, for rhetorical scholars to push beyond the (merely) epistemological concerns that have for so long circumscribed our theories of persuasion toward the examination of a "nearly existential" affectability, persuadability, responsivity? That push would require that we reconsider both the role and the scope of "affect" in the language-relation, which would in turn require us to reconsider what this "language-relation" involves and who or what might engage in it. University of Texas Austin, Texas Notes 1. In her brilliant and beautiful essay "On the Misery of Theory without Poetry: Heidegger's Reading of Holderlin's4 Andenken,'" Avital Ronell proposes that "the Greeting, in a strictly Holderlinian sense, can be understood as a saying that originates the relation between man and the divine, marking a cobelonging set in the very task of holding the separation between gods and man. In other, perhaps more contemporary words, it offers a trace of a relation to an ungraspable alterity, a sign of?or from?the sacred" (18). 2. I started to add "nor ghosts nor androids," but Levinas does deal with ghosts in a certain way, noting that taking out the other in a fit of violence does not get at the Other, which continues to haunt and heckle via the bad conscience that once again affirms the ethical imperative. He does not deal, however, with technological emissaries of the "non-living," which for him are mere things. See note 13. 3. The quote marks are to indicate that philosophy in general, and Heidegger very specifically, would not describe Bobby as "existing." Derrida takes Heidegger as an exemplary instance, demonstrating that according to him, the dog lives but does not have a Dasein, a being-there: "a dog does not exist," Heidegger writes in The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics, "but merely lives." Domestic animals ""live' with us" he continues, "but we do not live with them if living means: being in an animal kind of way. Yet we are with them nonetheless. But this being-with is not an existing-with" (210). Animals do not have world and so cannot be said properly to "exist" or to "die," according to Heidegger. Derrida, of course, challenges this (Animal 158-59). 4. "For hunted, beaten, or slaughtered animals," Derrida reminds us, "we are also men, alas, whom they identify only too quickly, regrettably, as men" (Animal 114).</page><page sequence="30">624 jac 5. See Kant's Universal Natural History and Theory ofthe Heavens, where he proposes, for example: However, most of the planets are certainly inhabited, and those that are not will be in the future. Now what sort of interconnections will be brought about among the different types of these inhabitants through the relationship between their place in the cosmic structure and the central point from which the warmth which gives life to everything extends outwards? For it is certain that, with the mate rials of these celestial bodies this heat will bring with it certain relationships in their compositions proportional to the distance from the center. In this comparison, the human being, who is, among all sensible beings, the one we know most clearly, although at the same time his inner composition is still an unexplored problem, must serve as the foundation and common reference point. (147) 6. Kant's racism and sexism seem to be pretty much in line with his culture at the time. He clearly considered the male the head of household by default, and his passion to categorize leads him in 1775 to sketch out, "in connection with the natural causes of their origin," a racial taxonomy consisting of four distinct races of man, each deriving from an original "stem genus": Stem genus: white brunette First Race, very blond (northern Europe), of damp cold. Second race, Copper-red (America), of dry cold. Third race, Black (Senegambia), of dry heat. Fourth race, Olive-yellow (Indians), of dry heat. ("On the Different" 48) The taxonomy proposes the natural inferiority of non-whites; indeed, Kant elswhere flat out states that to be "quite black from head to foot" is to be "stupid" ("On National" 57). Still, this presumed natural inferiority did not necessarily indicate exclusion from the realm of moral agency, which for Kant appears to include all human beings without consideration of race or sex or social class. 7. In his very early critique of Levinas's anthropocentrism, John Llewelyn writes that according to Levinas, Bobby "is too stupid, trop bete. Bobby is without logos and that is why he is without ethics. Therefore he is without Kantian ethics; and so he is without Levinasian ethics, since the ethics of Emmanuel Levinas is analgous to the ethtics of Immanuel Kant in that each is an ethics with a God within the limits of reason alone, but without a dog or any other beast, except indirectly, if we are to judge by reason alone" (51). 8. I understand why John Llewelyn writes that "the ethics of Emmanuel Levinas is analogous to the ethics of Immanuel Kant" (51), but they are also obviously not analogous, not at all, on several significant points.</page><page sequence="31">Diane Davis 625 9. See Kant's The Metaphysical Principles of"Virtue (pdrtllof The Metaphys ics ofMorals), 105. 10. "In order to be serious, and responsible," Derrida writes "at the risk of bringing back down to earth all the enchanted readers who, dreaming of recon ciling Levinas's ethics with the animals, set about idolizing this dog, it is necessary to limit straight away the scope of this hymn to .Bobby" (Animal 114). 11. God, in Levinas, is not a being but an effect (or affect), a posteriori, of the relation with the other mortal. 12.1 think of Anne Defourmantelle, writing alongside Jacques Derrida in Of Hospitality: "To offer hospitality," he wonders, "is it necessary to start from the certain existence of a dwelling, or is it rather only starting from the dislocation of the shelterless, the homeless, that the authenticity of hospitality can open up? Perhaps only the one who endures the experience of being deprived of a home can offer hospitality. (56) See also Michael Bernard-Donals's description of the host/guest/hostage in Levinas's work, where he notes that the displacement involved "is not just a conceptual or epistemological one; it is also, potentially, a physical one. When the individual engages the other, she resides in a kind of no-man's-land, in which she is both at home and in exile, neither completely apart from, nor completely a part of, the community or the location from which she speaks" (66). 13. Matthew Calarco points out that "Bobby's life is also at stake in the camp. He is not a pampered, Oedipal pet, but a nomad struggling to survive, living on 'in some wild patch' of the prison" (58). 14. If time and space permitted, we' d need to deconstruct this distinction, too. For now, I point you to SilviaBenso's excellent essay, "Of Things Face-to-Face." Thanks to Pat Gehrke for pointing me to it. 15. David Clark suggests that whereas Kant defines "amphiboly" as the transposition of what is "properly due the human onto the nonhuman," we might instead "recognize it as the trope of prosopopoeia?the giving of a face to that which is faceless" (89). But I' d like to retain the distinction Paul de Man articulates between anthropomorphism and prosopopoeia: Anthropomorphism is a human ist gesture that takes the essence of the "human" for granted: presuming human beings are essentially conscious and present entities endowed with the power of speech, it then projects this "human essence" onto some supposedly different sort of essence. Prosopopoeia, on the other hand, proceeds without substantial izing its gesture, taking the human to be an effect of figuration, on the figuring of "face," rather than the other way around. Anthropomorphism is possible only because it mis-takes a tropological effect for an essence, only because it confuses the face posited by a rhetorical process for a natural phenomenon, for a face given in nature. 16. "No one can deny the suffering, fear, or panic, the terror or fright that can</page><page sequence="32">626 jac seize certain animals and that we humans can witness," Derrida writes. Bentham's question in regard to the animal, "Can they suffer?" is not, for Derrida, a question; rather, it "leaves no room for doubt." And "that is why the experience that we have of it is not even indubitable; it precedes the indubitable, it is older than it" (28). One of Derrida's theses is that the West's impossibly cruel subjugation of animals has, over the last 200 years, reached such "unprecedented proportions" that it has sparked a surge of compassion. During this time frame, Derrida notes, the "traditional forms of treatment of the animal have been turned upside down by the joint developments of zoological, ethological, biological, and genetic forms of knowledge, which remain inseparable from techniques of intervention into their object, from the transformation of the actual object, and from the milieu and world of their object, namely, the living animal" (25). This has occurred by means farming and regimentalization at a demographic level unknown in the past, by means of genetic experimentation, the industrialization of what can be called the production for consumption of animal meat, artificial insemination on a massive scale, more and more audacious manipulations of the genome, the reduction of the animal not only to production and overactive reproduction (hormones, genetic crossbreading, clon ing, etc.) of meat for consumption, but also all sorts of other products. (25) Indeed, animal suffering is so great that it's no longer deniable, Derrida argues, which means that "men do all they can in order to dissimulate this cruelty or to hide it from themselves; in order to organize on a global scale the forgetting or misunderstanding of this violence, which some would compare to the worst cases of genocide" (26). Derrida uses the word "genocide" unapologetically, reminding us that there are "animal genocides: the number of species endangered because of man takes one's breath away" (26). But he is also talking about a different sort of genocide, one in which "the annihilation of certain species ... is occurring through the organization and exploitation of an artificial, infernal, virtually interminable survival, in conditions that previous generations would have judged monstrous, outside of every presumed norm of a life proper to animals that are thus exterminated by means of their continued existence or even their overpopulation" (26). And the impossible breadth of this cruelty and this suffering has sparked, Derrida says, a "new experience" of compassion; indeed, he suggests that a "war (whose inequality could one day be reversed) [is] being waged between, on the one hand, those who violate not only animal life but even and also this sentiment of compassion, and, on the other hand, those who appeal for an irrefutable testimony to this pity" (28-29). Though this war has probably never not been going on, Derrida hypothesizes that it is now in a "critical phase." And to think it through, this war, is not only a responsibility and an obligation, Derrida says;</page><page sequence="33">Diane Davis 627 "it is also a necessity, a constraint that, like it or not, directly or indirectly, no one can escape" (29). 17. In Giving an Account of Oneself Judith Butler proposes, alongside Foucault, that "the social dimension of normativity" offers a "framework for any scene of recognition, delineating who will qualify as a subject of recognition and offering available norms for the act of recognition" (22-23). According to her, the imperative to respond is conditioned by social norms, which reverses Levinas's order of things: the imperative does not come from a disturbance in cognition at all but from a "visual frame that conditions readability" (29). Either she is correct, and Levinas himself could not recognize (or acknowledge?see Michael Hyde) the face of Bobby because there was no normative frame in place qualifying him as a subject of recogntion, or else Levinas does experience Bobby's call but could not/would not take it up: that is, his response was "no." Butler again: The possibility of an ethical response to the face thus requires a normativity of the visual field: there is already not only an episte mological frame within which the face appears, but an operation of power as well, since only by virtue of certain kinds of anthropocen tric dispositions and cultural frames will a given face seem to be a human face to any one of us. After all, under what conditions do some individuals acquire a face, a legible and visible face, and others do not? (29-30) By resituating "face" in the realm of the visible and comprehensible, Butler is issuing a challenge to Levinas's entire discourse on the face. Indeed, one might imagine that she is poised here to launch a powerful critique of Levinas's "anthropocentric disposition," but she doesn't. In fact, she goes on to contem plate, without a hint of irony or deconstructive edge, what "the human" might mean for us today. It's no longer possible to describe "the human" as self sufficient or self-present since it is so obviously fallable, exposed, opaque to itself and others. But today we might describe "the human," Butler proposes, as that kind of being that has the capacity to embrace this fallability with "humililty" and "generosity," which again begs the question of whether any animal not classified as part of the human species could qualify as "human" under this definition. Butler does not address it, either way. 18. There is another writer, arguably both poet and prophet, who "admit[s] to taking upon [herself] the address that an animal addresses to [her]." In The Passion A ccording to G H., Clarice Lispector delivers an excruciating description of her protagonist's expropriating encounter with a cockroach. Perhaps a cock roach is not an "animal," per se, but the encounter with it effects a radical dehumanization: in the "face" of the roach, G.H. loses her sense of "the human." After inadvertently crushing it in the door of a wardrobe, she realizes that she has not killed it: it is half-crushed but alive. "Alive and looking at me," she tells us. Her first thought is to finish the job. "I lifted my arm up high, as if my entire body</page><page sequence="34">628 jac weight would come down on the wardrobe door along with the blow from my arm." Pause for paragraph break, and then: "But it was then that I saw the cockroach's face. It was aimed straight ahead, at the same level as my head and eyes. For an instant I paused with my hand poised in the air. Then, gradually, I lowered it. But it was too late by a split second: I had seen it" (47). And it had seen her. That is, she had seen it seeing her. What follows this encounter with the face of the other, le visage d'Autrui, consists in an extreme "experience" of destabilization and dehumanization: "Listen, in the presence of the living cockroach, the worst discovery was that the world is not human, and that we are not human" (61). And then the apocalyptic affirmation: "Dehumanization is as painful as losing every thing, as losing everything, my love" (66). In the face of the cockroach, G.H. can no longer simply detach from that which she disavows, realizing instead that "everything is alive and is made of the same thing" (61). Significantly, this expropriating disruption, this extreme self-interruption, does not culminate in generosity, in concern for the other, in any desire to give world (or the bread from my mouth) to the other: "I can't do anything for you, roach. I don't want to do anything for you" (77). It's not nothing that it is at the precise instant that G.H. decides the roach does not, in fact, have a face (but instead has a "mask") that she begins to contemplate "eating it," taking it in, appropriating and assimilating the otherness of the other: It was a mask. A deep sea diver's mask. That precious rusty-colored gem. The two eyes were alive like two ovaries. It looked at me with the blind fertility of its look. It was making my dead fertility fertile. Could its eyes be salty? If I touched them?since I was slowly becoming more and more impure anyway?if I touched them with my mouth, would I taste salt in them? (69) Later?right after she notes that it must be around noon, lunchtime?she admits with some hesitation and horror that "the cockroach is edible like a lobster, the cockroach was a crustacean" (105). And she finally does follow through with it, tasting the white matter oozing from the roach's partially crushed body, but she ultimately concludes that eating the other is not the best way to respond to an encounter. Not because it annihilates the other but because seeking assimilation is still a way to seek accretion, a way not to live in the now. In fact, inasmuch as she has held herself in relation to the roach rather than turning away (she tries to turn away but can't [70]), she has, in a certain sense, responded generously, in the most generous way possible. "The first step in relation to the other," she tells us, is not to assimilate it but "to find in oneself the man of all men. Every woman is the woman of all women, every man is the man of all men, and every one of them could appear wherever humankind is judged. But only in immanence, because only a few people reach the point of recognizing themselves in us. And then, in the simple presence of their existence, revealing our own" (168). So G.H. proposes that the ethical relation</page><page sequence="35">Diane Davis 629 involves the recognition in the other of the inhuman that is also in oneself. Indeed, according to G.H., once you get beyond (below) the sappy, sentimental human level of experience, to the "core" of life, inside "the heart of nature," difference falls away: inside nature's core, she and the cockroach would be the same, "there would be no difference between me and the cockroach" (73). There is therefore a significant difference between Derrida's description of his encounter with the little cat and Lispector's description of G.H.'s encounter with the roach: whereas Derrida concludes that the "differences" between him and the little cat are radical, innumerable, abyssal?a function not of identity but of differance?G.H. con cludes that at bottom there are no differences, that "we" are the same. So both approaches disturb the indivisible limit between "the human" and "the animal," but the latter dissolves the difference and the differance?which seems to beg the question of the ethical relation, indeed, of relationality as such?while the former exposes this limit as radically divisible, "feeding on an abyss."
