<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 INTRODUCTION This year sees many changes to Archaeological Reports: a new BSA director, and revised abbreviations. During this, my first attempt at writing 'Archaeology in Greece' I often felt that there is simply too much of it. Certainly the volume of information available increases year by year. In recent years, major public works have added to the need for rescue archaeology. The con- struction of the 'Egnatia Odos' (which, Romanists should note, does not really follow the route of the Via Egnatia) linking Igoumenitsa to the Greek border with Turkey has turned up vast amounts of new material in Epirus, Macedonia and Thrace. The widening of the national road between Patras and Athens and between Athens and Thessalonike has had a similar effect, as has the works built in advance of the 2004 Olympics around Athens. These new discoveries attract great interest in the Greek press. The sites so discovered have, for the most part, been excavated by teams of young, dedicated and talented Greek archaeologists working on contract with local Ephoreias. And new discoveries really do change things. Who would have thought, even fifteen years ago, that Bronze Age Crete had quite so many palaces? Similarly, the trickle of Middle Palaeolithic material from rescue and survey may profoundly change our view of that period in the Balkans; there is more and earlier Neolithic (and perhaps even Mesolithic) from the Cyclades than we had hitherto suspected; and the vast and rich cemeteries of EIA to Early Hellenistic date uncovered in the area of anc. Macedon must have a profound impact on our understanding of the history of that region. But if a prize has to be awarded for the most important discovery of 2002 it should go to Kythnos, where Professor Alexander Mazarakis Ainian has uncovered an unplundered adyton of an Archaic temple. Such things were not thought to survive at all. There have been other changes to the structure of Greek archaeology. There are plans to increase the number of Ephoreias and the number of archaeologists working for the Service. The new Greek archaeological law (as currently inter- preted at least) restricts Foreign Schools to a maximum of three school-only projects (survey and excavation) and three syner- gasies. Synergasies are defined as joint projects between a Foreign School and the Greek Archaeological Service - a joint project between a Greek university and a Foreign School can only count as a synergasia if the Greek co-director is or was a member of the Service. The new law also treats heads of archaeology departments in Greek universities as if they were directors of Foreign Schools. They too have to submit a pro- gramme of research every year to the Central Archaeological Council, though there is no limit on the number of projects they can submit. For everyone however fieldwork seasons have been restricted to a period of no more than six weeks. 'Archaeology in Greece' is compiled from many sources. The principal source remains the work of the Greek Archaeological Service, as presented in Archaidlogikon Deltion, the latest one available being that for 1997, published in 2002. I have sometimes given this as a short (ADelt) and a long (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997)) abbreviation. Other informa- tion comes from AEMTH 14 for 2000, Kritiki Estia 9 for 2002, Ergon (the work of the ASA) for both 2001 and 2002, individual reports submitted to 'A in G' (principally concerning the work of the Foreign Schools but sometimes also the work of Greek archaeologists working for either the Service or Greek univer- sities) and newspaper reports. I have made a number of changes from 'A in G' for 2001-02. In previous years, while the names of directors of field projects who have submitted their reports directly to 'A in G' have been given, information from ADelt has been treated as if it were anonymous. This seemed to be an anomaly that needed rectifying. When newspaper reports are referred to, both the name of the newspaper and the date have been given. The final reports on survey and excavation have been listed by site or region, as appropriate, rather than being given in a long list in the introduction. I have also tried to be consistent in giving the exact location of discoveries, through topothesia names, street numbers, O.T. numbers and plot names (where known). The (sometimes lengthy) contributions from individual project directors have been edited with a view to emphasising new facts, particularly new facts that lead to new interpretations. Information about funding, personnel or future plans has generally not been included in 'A in G'. Finally, I have attempted to list sites within some kind of geographical order within each geographical section, grouping them by nomarchia or eparchia when known. Though a geographical ordering may make some information less accessible, there are advantages to such an ordering, for it allows sites and discover- ies to be seen in context. For example, recent finds from both Kalyvia, Thorikou: Phoinikia and Anavyssos in Southern Attika both help to place the famous Anavyssos kouros in some kind of context. Their geographical juxtaposition makes sense, and provides information which an alphabetical ordering would obscure. Finally, the new publications section has been scrapped. In previous issues of AR publications have been listed after the introduction, and arranged in alphabetical order by publisher. This is not particularly useful if you want to find out if more has been published on, say, the rural landscape of Laconia. So new publications, in particular final reports of surveys or excava- tions, are now listed by the site or region they refer to. So the new publication of the Kouros from the Kerameikos in Athens, reported in last year's 'A in G' will now be found listed with the report on the Kerameikos. In recent years, at least since 1990, 'A in G' has been the work of many hands. The role of the Director of the British School at Athens has become that of an editor or compiler. In 'A in G' 2002-03 I have attempted, to a degree, to return to the practice of Hector Catling, where the Director does much of the work himself. This may sound anachronistic, but then in a sense 'A in G' is an anachronism. If one were compiling such a resource from scratch today, one would think first of compiling a searchable database rather than a linear narrative, and such indeed may be the form that 'A in G' may take. But all that is for the future. The experience of producing a digest has been a valuable one, and one that I could not have done without much help. For the provision of the bulk of the photographs I would like to thank the Greek Archaeological Service and the Archaeological Society. For the reports and illustrations they have supplied, I am grateful to all the directors of field projects and staff in other Foreign Schools. Heinrich Hall and Astrid Lindenlauf have helped in compiling and translating submis- sions from the Austrian and German Institutes. Maria Elena Gorrini has helped to translate the reports in French and Valentina di Napoli reports from the Italian School. Koula Asiatidou has compiled the newspaper reports. Penny Wilson has compiled a bibliography of new site and survey reports. Vicki Tzavara and Helen Clark have given invaluable editorial assistance. Graham Oliver has given invaluable advice about epigraphy, and Heinrich Hall has helped greatly in editing the contributions from individual field directors. The information from AEMTH for Western Macedonia has been summarized by Despoina Christodoulou. As in the past, Eleni Hatzaki has com- piled the report for Crete and David Turner has summarized the information from the Byzantine Ephoreias. David Turner, a noted Byzantine historian and honorary member of the BSA,</page><page sequence="2">2 JAMES WHITLEY has been covering Byzantine Archaeology for 'A in G' since 1990; he was the most experienced member of the 'A in G' team. Unfortunately this contribution will be his last. He died, after an illness, at the age of forty-two on the 26th July 2003. He will be much missed. ATHENS NATIONAL MUSEUMS National Archaeological Museum. K. Demakopoulou, N. Kaltsas, E. Zervoudaki and R. Proskynitopoulou report (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 1-10) on developments during 1997. Exhibitions in 1997 included the 'Aidonia Treasure' and 'The Italian Presence in the Dodecanese, 1912-45'. The museum also contributed to exhibitions on 'Greek Jewellery' and 'Alexander and the East', both held in Thessalonike. In all departments, conservation, cataloguing and photographic record- ing of the collections continued. In most departments, collec- tions were augmented largely through confiscation of antiqui- ties that had been illicitly acquired by private individuals. The Department of Prehistoric Antiquities reported on the investigation of a soros, a previously unexamined deposit of bones, earth and other material, left over from Schliemann's excavations of grave V in grave circle A at Mycenae. The bone fragments were too small to be identified, but small items of gold and amber were recovered. The Department also noted the acquisition of a hoard of 53 gold ornaments of L Neo/Chalco- lithic date (fig. 1). 1 Gold 'ring idol' from an unprovenanced hoard 2 Bronze helmet of 'Illyrian' type The Department of Sculpture noted several acquisitions through confiscation. These included a marble head of Asklepios; two marble heads of Serapis; two marble lion-headed water-spouts; a marble head of Demosthenes; and an inscribed Hel plaque of marble showing a warrior in low relief. The Department of Vases noted, amongst other acquisitions, the confiscation of a collection of Cypriot pottery of Geo and Ar date, and of a number of lekythoi and Cl terracottas. The Department of Bronzes noted the acquisition of 147 bronze and iron objects confiscated near Brindisi, including an 'Illyrian' helmet, probably of Cl date (fig. 2). Numismatic Museum I. Touratsoglou reports (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 12-18) on developments during 1997. As well as additions through gift or purchase, the museum acquired a hoard of 53 Athenian Cl coins (11 tetradrachms, 18 drachmai) from excavations undertaken in 1977 at O. Alkibiadis in Piraeus. These are now published by M. Oikonomidis, 'Contribution de l'etude du monnayage athenien a l'epoque classique: le Tresor trouve au Pir6e en 1977', Revue Belge de Numismatique 145 (1999) 17-20. The museum also noted its acquisition, through purchase, of a hoard of 51 EByz coins (poXecov) of Anastasius 1st, Justin 1St and Justinian, acquired through the help of the 18th EPCA (Thrace). Epigraphical Museum. Ch. Kritsas reports (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 19-21) on developments during 1997. New information has been acquired through cleaning and reconstruction. This includes a new reading ofIG II2 3077 (= EM 10672) and a new fragment of IG I3 628 (see under Acropolis museum below). Some inscriptions have been acquired. One is a fragment of an Attic decree of Hel (1st or 2nd Ct BC) date (EM 13497, fig. 3). Three come from the location of Thiti in Vari, one (from the small church of the 'Eisodion tis Theotokou' = EM 13496) is a Cl marble tombstone of the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC; two other small inscriptions (EM 13201 and 13202) come from the vicinity (for all these, see H.R. Goette, AM 110 (1995) 235-46). 3 Hellenistic inscription, Attic decree EM13497 ..... -.? i</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 3 4 Athens, agora: late Roman-Byzantine structures in the northwest corer J 11 12 13 |I lir7I 1 1191 2 m Tank J 0 ^ QaTie Foo 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 ' o Tile Roor r ) ? o1 | 2 j~~~~~~~~,?0 I</page><page sequence="4">4 JAMES WHITLEY ACROPOLIS EPHOREIA (1ST EPCA) In 1997 (according to ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 30-44) most work was devoted to conservation, cleaning and restoration, in the course of which a number of discoveries were made. Acropolis. I. Triandi and Ch. Vlassopoulou (ADelt 30-31) report on the acquisition for the Acropolis Museum of a new fragment of the inscribed Ar base of Nearchos and Antenor (IG I3 628), which is usually thought to have served as the base for 'Antenor's kore' (Akr. 681) (see also under Epigraphical Museum). T. Tanoulas (ADelt 38-9) reports on conservation and restoration work in the propylaia. In 2002-3, the Greek press (Kathimerini 1/10/2002, 15) con- tinues to report on restoration work on the acropolis. The return of a fragment of a metope, originally from the Parthenon and most recently held in the museum of Palermo, was also widely commented on (Kathimerini 1/10/2002, 15; Ethnos 1/10/2002; Apogevmatini, 1/10/2002, 70). A dedicated publication, The Acropolis Restoration News, has been issued once a year since 2001. It outlines principles of the works, and reports on recent progress. Plaka. In 2002-3 restoration work was completed on the Monument of Lysikrates (Eleutheros Typos 21/2/2003, 38). V. Vasilopoulou (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 32-3) reports on a number of cleaning excavations. Finds remain where they were discovered, i.e. normally within the fabric of moder or Med house walls. At O. Tholou 10: Cl-Hel Ionic column capital and a small rectangular plaque were found. 5 Athens, agora: Roman-Byzantine well - - - 6 Athens, agora: 1St Ct AD Roman figurines and lamp mould At O. Thrasyboulou 13-15: Ten Cl-Hel small sculptural frag- ments and 18 architectural fragments were noted. At O. Areos 14a: one Cl-Hel sculptural fragment and one Hel funerary kioniskos was noted. At O. Panos 16, V. Vasilaki (ADelt, 33) notes the discovery of LByz walls in excavations conducted in advance of construction of a new storeroom. Roman Agora and Library of Hadrian. A. Choremi, Ephor of the Acropolis (ADelt 37-8) reports on cleaning and restoration work. In the Library of Hadrian, further traces of the Herulian Wall (276-282 AD) were found, together with two fragmentary decrees, and an honorific Rom inscription (in Greek) to one P. Aelius Julius Dionysus Nicopolites, dating to the reign of Commodus (180-84 AD). A colossal Cl statue of Nike, over 3m high and dating to the 5th or 4th Ct BC, found in the Library of Hadrian, formed the subject of a talk given by A. Choremi of the 1st EPCA at the British Museum (Ethnos 22/11/2002). Anc. agora. A. Choremi notes (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 36-7) conservation and restoration work undertaken in 1997. John Camp (ASCSA) gives the following report on the 2002 excava- tions undertaken by the ASCSA: 'Excavations in the Athenian agora in June and August 2002 was in three areas: at the NW comer of the agora (sections BE and BZ), along the Panathenaic Way (section S), and just S of the Eleusinion on the N slopes of the acropolis (section EL). Section BZ. In the NW comer we continued to explore the transition between the 10th/llth AD Byz settlement and the LRom remains which underlie it (fig. 4). Most of the features of the Med settlement had been known, but our under- standing of several was refined by this season's work. The large plastered cistern found last season (J 2: 20) was dismantled and proved to have been lined with mud-bricks, and a paved platform was encountered around the mouth of well (J 2: 18) in room B. A large coarse-ware jar buried under the floor in the corner of room D contained the skeletal remains of an infant (J 1: 4). The Byz walls, made of assorted stones and tiles set in mud, have a fair admixture of anc. material built in, including some very large blocks. Several of the marbles, though fragmentary, clearly come from funerary monuments (columnar grave monuments, sarcophagus lids, grave reliefs), which must have been brought in from beyond the city walls, some 500 meters to the NW. The LRom walls, recognizable from their lower levels and the use of a lime mortar, should tie in with similar walls found to the SE. Thus far no clear plan or obvious function has been identified for the Rom remains, though a terracotta water channel and large rectangular settling basin were found in what should be a courtyard around well J 2: 18, which seems to have been in use in both the Rom and Byz phases (fig. 5). Floor levels, thresholds, and the well all seem to fall fairly consistently between 53.25 and 53.75m asl for the latest Rom floors. An assortment of small terracottas was found in the area, both reliefs and figurines (fig. 6); similar EHel to LRom pieces have been a common find in the immediately adjacent area. A mould for an alpha-globule lamp (fig. 6; ca 100 AD) was also encountered, but gener- ally there are no signs of kilns or other industrial activity which would suggest that the material was actually being made in the vicinity.</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 5 A LRom pit in the area produced one of the more interesting finds of the season (fig. 7), the marble head of a long-haired, heavily bearded individual wearing a rolled and twisted fillet ornamented with some sort of central medallion or jewel. Such fillets are often interpreted as indicating that the individual depicted is a priest, though the unusually long locks and some- what idealized features perhaps suggest that we are dealing here with a deity or barbarian, rather than a portrait. The carved pupils of the eyes and the deep drilling of the hair indicate a date in the advanced or late Rom period. Section BE. In the adjacent area we explored various levels in, around, and under the Cl commercial building. The torren- tial downpour on July 8th, submerged the trench and led to the collapse of a wall, causing us to alter our plans for the season. Despite these difficulties, a round shaft lying under the S wall of the Cl commercial building was partially excavated. It seems to be a well (J 3: 8), dating to the protoGeo or EGeo period (ca 1000-900 BC), making it the earliest evidence of habitation in this area N of the Eridanos River. In the upper part of the well we encountered the well-preserved skeleton of a robust young man, loosely flexed, lying on his right side (fig. 8). A preliminary analysis of the bones by Prof. Maria Liston suggests that he was 30-35 years old, muscular, and must have suffered from severe back pain. The pose and the full complement of bones in their correct relative position suggest that the burial was intended rather than accidental and that after its collapse and/or abandonment the upper part of the well was deliberately used as a grave (J 3: 9). We reached a depth of about 2m, at which point the regular collapse of soft, saturated bedrock from the sides of the shaft persuaded us to cease operations. Panathenaic Way. A small trial trench was opened up along the E side of the Panathenaic Way, to the W of the bema in front of the Stoa of Attalos. Earlier excavations in the area had only been carried down to the LRom levels. It is clear that the width and course of the road varied somewhat over the centuries. The SW side of the street is well defined in the Hel and Rom peri- ods by a handsome stone gutter, but the NE edge is generally far less well defined. In places the maximum width of the road can be measured where it is limited on either side by buildings, but its full width has not been determined where it passes through the open square. We hoped to find the anc. shoulder and there- fore the edge of the road, and several hard-packed surfaces were encountered, though further digging will be necessary before we can confidently restore the width and history of the Panathenaic Way. Eleusinion. Work continued also in the area just S of and uphill from the Eleusinion. In the absence of surviving archi- tectural remains, our understanding of the use of the area in antiquity (residential, sacred, industrial?) will probably have to 7 Athens, agora: late Roman marble portrait of a priest (?) come from wells, cisterns, and/or other deposits in pits in the bedrock. This season we excavated more of a well (1.15m di. and over 12m d.) first encountered in 2001, though we have not yet reached the bottom; it was cut through hard bedrock and unlined. The fill seems to be datable to the late 6th/E 5th Ct BC and produced a bronze measure for dry goods, the skeletons of several dogs, a fair number of loomweights, assorted fragments of painted pottery, and the palmette finials of a stone altar. Scraping bedrock also resulted in the surprise of the season: a handsome, well-preserved, marble portrait head, apparently of a priest (fig. 9) (see also Ethnos 21/12/2002). The head is life- size, showing a male with abundant curly hair and a light beard. On his head he wears an elaborate diadem or crown, decorated with eight small busts, either cuirassed or togate. Crowns of this type are usually interpreted as an indication that the individual .-*:;: f . , * . - = = = = = = i - = - . . ,: ' :::i : i:- :::: :~ : : *:::; j ..* ***.*- * L' : ::,.

Virtually all of the 21 examples known are from Asia Minor. They vary in many respects, like the format of the sculpture (bust or statue), the gender of the wearer, the number and nature of the busts (some- times of mortals, sometimes of gods). The motif also occurs in another 55 instances on coins, sculpted reliefs, etc., again almost exclusively from Asia Minor. The appearance of such a rare, substantial and well-preserved example from Athens is therefore noteworthy. While in many of the known examples the busts on the crown depict both members of the imperial family and deities, those on the crown of the new head seem to portray only mortals, increasing the probability that the head is that of a priest of the imperial cult. It is unclear whether the busts represent a single generation of the imperial family or the lineal descent through eight generations, or a combination of the two. The absence of any female figures perhaps suggests that the busts are arranged dynastically rather than as a family group. The figures are small but relatively well cut and detailed. All the heads seem to be bearded and the fourth figure from the left has a round object decorating the centre of his cuirass, apparently a gorgoneion. The appearance of this device should help to date the piece: the 10 Athens, Theseion area: ostrakon naming Aristeides, son of Lysimachus gorgoneion appears in the pediment of the outer propylon at Eleusis (often identified as Marcus Aurelius), on several marble portraits of Marcus Aurelius, and on a gold bust of Marcus Aurelius found at Plotinoupolis in 1965, now in the Komotini museum. Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus, and Commodus all had particularly close ties with Athens and it is probably to within their reigns in the late 2nd Ct AD that we should date this piece. The head shows signs of obvious reworking in the area of the beard, suggesting that the piece was recut to serve as the likeness of a second individual, presumably in the 3rd Ct AD.' Anc. agora, N of the Hephaisteion. Ta Nea (22/7/2002, 7) reports on finds from an MHel well (dated to ca 175-150 BC) containing the bones of 445 skeletons of infants and children, as well as bones of at least 150 dogs. The well was located just N of the Hephaisteion, close to the altar of Aphrodite Ourania. Theseion. M. Pologiorgi reports (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 33-4) on work conducted in 1997 not far from the area of the Kerameikos excavations. At O. Pnykos 10 (plot of V. Vasilaki) as well as LC1, Hel and Rom finds, an undisturbed LAr-ECl stratum of 5th-Ct date was reached in the course of rescue exca- vations. The stratum mainly consisted of plain and black-glazed wares, possibly from a dump from a potter's workshop, and at least one bronze vessel. The principal find was an incised ostrakon naming Aristeides the son of Lysimachos, possibly dating to the ostracism of 483 BC (fig. 10). K. Lazaridis (ADelt, 39-43) reports on cleaning and restoration work in the area of the archaeological park to the W and S of the acropolis. On the Mouseion Hill the so-called Kimonian Monuments were reinvestigated, and on the Pnyx the Kallirhoe spring and the Pnyx itself were cleaned. The major discovery was the find of two LAr horos inscriptions cut into the virgin rock on the Hill of the Nymphs, which appear to define the lim- its of the sanctuary of Zeus. Pnyx area, at the junction of Apostolou Pavlou and Aiginitou, Epta Meres TV (28/6/2002, 84) reports new discov- eries which help to locate a sanctuary of Pan, just S of the acropolis.</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 7 Apogevmatini tis Kyriakis (2/3/2003, 74) reports plans for restoration of the Monument of Thrasyllos.

Zachariadou (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 45-7) reports on work at the new Syntagma Metro station. Entrance D. Fifty-five graves were found (trenches, cists, tile graves and beehives). The earliest was subMyc, associated with pottery and two bronze pins. Of the rest, one was of LC1, nine of Hel, and 21 of Rom date. In addition, remains of a LRom-ECh (5th-6th Ct AD) bath complex were uncovered, with mosaic floors (fig. 11) and an accompanying hydraulic and drainage network (clay pipes, 5 small and 3 large wells and 2 rock-cut cisterns). Entrance F. Further remains of the hydraulic network (16 drains, 3 small and 2 large wells) close to the banks of the Eridanos river. Nearby, along the E side of Leophoros Amalias, close to the National Gardens, Eleutherotypia (1/3/2003) reports on the investigation of a similar LRom-ECh bath complex, construct- ed in the post-Herulian period (late 3rd or early 4th Ct AD) and remaining in use during the 5th and 6th Cts. The complex was equipped with hypocausts, reusing 17 Hel funerary kioniskoi as supports. T.

Stoupa (ADelt, 52-6) provides more details of the fun- erary complex, thought to be part of the Demosion Sema, uncovered at O. Salaminos 35, and previously reported in AR 1997-98, 8-11. All the cremated remains were male, and the complex is clearly in the right place on the route between the Dipylon gate and the Academy. More sherds from the cuttings can be attributed to known painters: the Bowdoin painter, Zanoni painter, Aischines painter and Sabouroff painter as well as the Achilles, Tymbos and Kleophon painter (as previously reported). Kerameikos. The spectacular discoveries of Ar sculptures in May 2002 (AR 2001-02, 10-11) have now been published: Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier, Der Kuros vom Heiligen Tor (Mainz. Philipp von Zaber, 2002). Prof. Niemeier and Dr Jutta Stroszeck report on excavations conducted by the DAI from June 2002 onwards: 'Various research projects were conducted for the first time under the overall direction of Professor Niemeier, the Director of the DAI, assisted by the field director, Dr Jutta Stroszeck. Work took place in four areas. (1) The foundation walls of a small, S-oriented naiskos located within a triangular enclosure at the E edge of the South Hill had already been unearthed by the ASA from the 1870s to the 1880s. Its date and the goddess to which it was originally dedicated are unclear. In 2002, Dr Torsten Matter (University of Marburg) started to re-examine this building complex, dis- tinguishing at least two building phases that differ in building technique and in the orientation of the naiskos.A stratigraphic date cannot be determined due to 19th Ct excavations, but a rel- ative chronology can be reconstructed by means of its relation-</page><page sequence="8">8 JAMES WHITLEY 12 Athens: grave stele of Aristion, Kerameikos Inv. 3542 ship to better-known architectural structures nearby. Of crucial importance is the relationship between the foundation trench of the first phase of this structure and the pit of grave No. 3, exca- vated by Dr U. Knigge in 1971 and dated to the beginning to the 5th Ct BC. It remains to be seen whether grave No. 3 is more recent than the W wall of the sanctuary. If so, the first phase of the sanctuary belongs to the 6th Ct and predates the Persian destruction. (2) A long narrow tomb of limestone blocks to the W of the Dromos was excavated in the 1930s and identified by a frag- mentary inscription found nearby as the tomb of the Lacedaemonian officers who died in 403 BC in battle against the Athenian democrats (Xen. Hell. II, 28ff.). This identifica- tion can be further supported by an examination of the grave goods and the burial customs: i.e. the practice of putting stones under the heads of the deceased, and the fact that the skeletons have recognizable wounds. In 2002, this tomb was re-exam- ined for publication by Dr Jutta Stroszeck and Dr Alexander von Kienlin (Technical University, Munich). Four building phases were identified, and it turned out that the building is much longer than previously thought. The original position of the marble inscription and its restoration need therefore to be revised. (3) The excavations at the dromos in front of the Dipylon Gate were continued by Dr Stroszeck in May and June and the previously suggested date of the street levels verified. LHel to LRom layers can be seen in the cross-section through the dromos. Various channel systems (both for both fresh water and efflu- ent), operating separately and dated to different time periods, were documented in the entire excavated area close to the Dipylon Gate. While uncovering the edge of the foundation of a large Rom tomb built in opus caementum at the left side of the street, a grave (D 8) came to light, containing one glass bal- samarium. Dr Inge Schr6der identified the skeleton as that of a man aged 40. Next to the contracted leg of the skeleton were the remains of two new born children. The summer storm of July 8th revealed a painted grave-stele (fig. 12) of the 3rd Ct BC in the filling of a LHel channel. It is the grave-stele of the comedy actor Aristion, who is well known from literary sources: he won twice in the Theatre of Dionysos and participated as an actor in the Amphictyonic games at Delphi in 265 BC (see forthcoming AM 117, 2002). The stele carries the inscription 'Aristionos' in large letters. The field below this inscription is empty except for a painted comedy mask. Its lower frame consists of the following epigram run- ning over six lines: Here I lie, my father is Aristaios from Troizen/ at the age of 40 years, I have completed my life-span/ and died, the third-born, as the first./And the mound has been heaped up by my sister and my brother in/foreign land, and I was without descendants. But my name was/Aristion. I per- formed the art of comedy. (4) In the area of the Sacred Gate, three excavations were conducted: one in the proteichisma in November, another one in the street immediately S of the gateway and the third one below the Sacred Way, at the NW end of the Sacred Gate. A LRom marble monument on top of the proteichisma in front of the Sacred Gate was in urgent need of restoration after the summer rains (see Ethnos 20/9/2002). To allow the con- struction of a new foundation, it was recorded by Dr Nils Hellner (Munich) and removed. A small excavation was then conducted in the filling of the proteichisma. Below the filling of the first phase, dated to ca 300 BC, was discovered a finely worked limestone base that had been pulled down to the lowest two courses in antiquity. The uppermost preserved course (2.1 x 2.2m) contains six blocks which are interconnected with dou- ble-T-shaped iron dowels in a lead coating. The date and func- tion of the monument will be clarified in 2003 - did it once belong to a LAr grave precint or to an honorific monument that was constructed after the Themistoklean Wall of 479/78 BC? In spring 2002, a number of smaller test trenches were opened by Professor Bettina Baroness von Freytag gen. L6ringhoff (Tiibingen) in the area of the Sacred Gate, to clarify its architectural development prior to publication by Dr Gerhard Kuhn (Marburg). Unearthing the S side of the S tower, near the townward end, led to the discovery of an interesting foundation, probably Ar, measuring 15m from NW to SE edges; its full extent, its height and function (grave precinct?) are to be inves- tigated next year.' The discovery of six Ar marble bases is also mentioned in press reports (Avgi 14/7/2002). ATTIKA AND THE MEGARID WESTERN ATTIKA AND THE MEGARID Aigaleo. M.

Finds included a stone wash-basin, charcoal, bronzes, worked bone and bronze- working debris. O. Phavierou 50 (Karantza plot): remains of LCl-EHel house (350-300 BC), the central area covered with pebble mosaic (possibly but not certainly an andron, since no klinai were found) and equipped with a cistern. Akti Themistokleous: a limestone block, probably from Kononian wall. Junction of O. Karaiskou and Alkibiadou 94 (Drakoulinakou plot): remains of anc. road with structures on either side. On the W side, remains of two EHel-MHel (end 4th to 2nd Ct BC) houses, both with small courtyards and andrones with peb- ble mosaic floors. On the E side, remains of a large structure with columns, thought to be an EHel industrial complex, with remains of bronze-working, in use from the end of the 4th Ct to the 3rd quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. To Vima (20/9/2002, A23) reports on a plan to turn the area of the wall and gate of anc.

Petritaki (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 77-8) reports on rescue work at the junction of O. Moutsopoulou and Sirangiou (ADelt, 77-8) on walls and columns probably from shipsheds of the Harbour of Zea. Bjorn Loven reports on work undertaken by the Danish Institute, in co-operation with the EMA and the 2nd EPCA: 'Preserved in a basement of a block of flats on the comer of Akti Moutsopoulou and Sirangiou in the E part of Zea harbour is the upper part of three (out of ten) shipsheds originally exca- vated by Dragatsis and Dorpfeld in 1885. Excavation in 2002 of modem deposits covering part of this structure revealed a closed deposit containing material from the 4th Ct BC, related to the construction of shipshed Tr. Excavation of the submerged part of shipshed Tr, the best-preserved shipshed in the basement, was begun and it is now evident that this part of the structure is</page><page sequence="10">10 JAMES WHITLEY 14 Piraeus: shipshed rn slipway in the harbour of Zea remarkably well preserved (fig. 14). Two of four aligned socket- holes on the middle of the slipway contained wood fragments and a substantial piece of wood. The socket-holes fastened a wooden structure to the slipway, and the wood may originate from the slipway structure, but carbon dating is needed for verification. Remains of several hitherto unknown shipsheds have been found in the E part of the harbour basin, and others have been seen from the shore in the W part. We therefore conclude that a significant part of the anc. harbour is preserved in the sea. The study of 14 column drums and parts thereof found in the harbour basin in 1964 and now held by the Hellenic Maritime Museum has enabled us to identify the first three column drums in the load-bearing elements of the Zea shipsheds. They provide important information regarding both the height of the ship- sheds and the available space for the trireme between the colon- nades at the height of the outrigger rail.' Moschato. M. Petritaki (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 80) reports on work undertaken by the 2nd EPCA in 1997. At O. Konstantinoupoleos 105 (Aik. Gidakou plot), a LC1 wall, probably part of farm building was found. Ethnos (6/12/2002) reports new finds of the Long Walls at the edges of the Moschato and Kallithea Metro stations. For much of their course, the walls appear to run parallel to the Metro line. Neo Phaleron. M. Petritaki (ADelt, 80-82) reports that at junc- tion of O.

To Ethnos (19/8/2002) reports the discov- ery and excavation of 24 Myc chamber tombs on Fleming hill above Vari. The tombs date from the 15th to the 12th Ct BC (LH IIIA-IIIC?). Finds include over 100 vessels, sealstones, steatite beads, Phi and Psi figurines, gold rosettes and bronze axes. LAVREOTIKI (SOUTH ATTIKA: LAVRION, THORIKOS AND SOUNION) Kalyvia Thorikou, Thermi. A. Tsaravopoulos, 2nd EPCA, (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 84-5) reports on investigations undertaken in 1997 in advance of construction on the Hygeia hospital plot, extending from the hill of Thermi to Lagonisi and the slopes of Lavreotikos Olympos. Kalpi. As well as remains of various structures, dating from Cl to ECh times, there were some significant PH finds: one LN-EHI deposit; and, on the summit of the hill, remains of EH II apsidal house. EH III and MH sherds were also found in the vicinity. N of Thermi (hill to W) chiefly Cl remains were found: walls and remains of Cl-Hel ceramic beehives, similar to those from the Vari house; Cl cist tomb. To the W, two enigmatic stone circles, both of 50m di. (undated) were investigated, and on the slopes of the hill of Thermi, remains of a (Cl-Rom?) quarry. Kalyvia Thorikou, Phoinikia (Melissourgou-Kouruti and Psaridi-Chatzigeorgiou plot). A. Tsaravopoulos (ADelt, 86) reports on investigations of a looted cemetery of LGeo-Cl date. Behind the tower of Melissourgou there were two small Cl cist graves, with mid 5th Ct black figure lekythoi. To NW of this tower, opposite the findspot and tymbos of the Anavyssos kouros, an extensive cemetery of LGeo-Cl times had been thor- oughly pillaged. Some (Cl?) funerary periboloi, marble funer- ary stelai and sarcophagi could still be identified. The oldest graves were cremations, sometimes in urns (e.g. fig. 15) and there is continuity of use through the 7th Ct BC. Use of the cemetery lessens during the 5th Ct, and ends by the middle of the 4th Ct. In the SE comer of the area were remains of smashed pottery, probably remains of a funerary feast (perideipnon). Anavyssos (Patitiria - Maltezou plot). M. Oikonomakou (ADelt, 89) reports on the discovery of a horos stone of the property (chorio) of one Diognetos, who may be identified with the Diognetos of the deme of Anaphlystos, already known from prosopography (PA 3856).

At the edge of the Moutousi plot, heavy rain revealed three LGeo graves (one pyre and two interments in pithoi (enchytrismoi)). Finds included cups, kan- tharoi, pyxides and oinochoai. THE MESOGEIA AND NORTHWEST ATTIKA Vravrona. K. Eustratiou (Ergon 2001, 22-25) undertook the cleaning of the enclosure wall in the acropolis above the site of Brauron, where I. Papadimitriou had earlier excavated an MH settlement. Sherds of MH Minyan ware and of LH IIIA date were recovered. Merenda Markopoulou. Both Ethnos (28/9/2002) and Apogevmatini (6/2/2003) report on rescue excavations in the area designated as the sites of the Olympic racecourse (hippo- drome) and the riding centre (ippiko kentro). Discoveries include a Neo settlement (6000-3500 BC) on a small hill, whose use perhaps extended into EH times, with stone-lined pits. This may be the same settlement as that of Pallini men- tioned in an earlier newspaper article (Ethnos 'Time out', 16/6/2002, 14); if not, there are two such settlements (see below). Cemeteries of Myc, Geo, Ar and Cl date and Cl, Hel and Rom farmsteads are also reported. Investigations have also determined the sites of two Cl temples, a temple of Athena at the church of PanAgia, the temple of Artemis Kollainis and a small sanctuary of Aphrodite. Ethnos 'Time out' (16/6/2002, 14-15) reports the discovery of a network of roads of Geo-Cl date discovered in the course of construction of the Attiki Odos in the Mesogeia. Stavros Geraka or Pallini. M. Platonos (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 90-92) reports on excavations conducted by the 2nd EPCA on the site of the sanctuary of Athena at anc. Pallene, whose main Cl Periclean temple structure was reconstructed in the middle of the Athenian Agora in Rom times, and which was for long mistakenly identified as the Temple of Ares at Achamai. Excavations took place in three locations: At the junction of Androutsou and Zalongou: along the E and NE wing of the temple discoveries included Geo terracotta figurines of winged type (9th-8th Ct BC); 150 animal figurines (horses, bulls, goats and snakes); the rectangular base of a male figure; 4 daedalic heads; 80 bronzes, including pins and fibulae; 2 finger rings, one of pseudo-silver, with Egyptian characters on the bezel. Associated pottery was of Geo, Ar, Cl and Hel date. None of these finds however came from a closed context that could be identified as the sanctuary's apothetis. At the junction of Kleisthenous 26 and Androutsou (O.T. 182, K. Verukokidi plot): the marble foot of a horse from one of the Cl temple's metopes, together with other architectural and sculptural fragments were found, as well as a pottery deposit of Cl date. On O. Androutsou 8 (Plevraki plot): along the N wing of the temple, sherds of Geo and Cl date, more 8th Ct Geo figurines and more architectural fragments were recovered. It is not clear whether the N settlement at Pallini (Ethnos 'Time out', 16/6/2002, 14) is the same as that at Merenda Markopoulou (see above). Porto Raphti. Eleutherotypia (22/11/2002) reports on investi- gations of EH settlements on the peninsula of Pountas and on the island of Raftopoula. On the latter, finds of Cyc marble vessels, obsidian, and pottery were noted. Rock-cut Cl-Hel shipsheds have also been reported on the peninsula of Korone. Marousi. Ta Nea (14/7/2002) reports discoveries made in the course of construction of the Attiki Odos, in the angle formed by Leophoros Kifissias and Leophoros Pelika. A network of C1 roads, wells and other Cl hydraulic works, and cemeteries are mentioned. The principal find was the 'tomb of the ephebe', containing 19 C1 vessels, including two white-ground lekythoi attributed to the Achilles painter (mid 5th Ct BC). Kifissia. Finds are reported in two locations: Rema Chelidonous. To Vima (12/12/2002) reports on the excavation of a small C1 sanctuary of Artemis found in the bed of the Chelidonos river during the course of construction of the Attiki Odos. The site consists of two small naiskoi, and is iden- tified through two 4th Ct BC inscriptions and two figurines of 5th Ct date. There is also mention of a large Rom structure nearby. Kato Kifissia.

The first (LCl-Hel?) was a cremation inside a bronze hydria placed in a marble cist, accompanied by six stone alabastra, one decorated with gold leaf. The second was a Cl marble sarcophagus, accompanied by five white ground and some black figure lekythoi. At Gerovouni-Auliza, at the junction of Ritsou and Chalkidike streets, a large LRom farm complex was further investigated; it includes a large rectangular structure. Associated pottery was dated to the 4th and 5th Cts AD. Kalisteri Phylis, Spilies. M.

A small tymbos of river peb- bles was investigated, together with damaged graves in the vicinity. The best finds (Chalcolithic crusted ware and an amphoriskos of Cyc type) came from cist grave 65. Study in 2002 enabled 300 vessels to be restored (figs. 16, 17). Schoinia. There has been much discussion in the press (Kathimerini 7/9/2002, 7; To Vima 20/9/2002 and 26/9/2002) of the discovery of an EH settlement at the site of the Olympic rowing lake, then in the planning stage (finished in 2003). Early reports had mentioned a small rectangular structure thought to be associated with Geo pottery and interpreted as a small sanc- tuary, and there was some discussion as to whether these sherds had fallen from elsewhere. Other structures were discovered, all dated to the EH period. Associated pottery included storage pithoi. There was much discussion as to whether the settlement remains should be lifted and taken elsewhere. Finds of Cl (4th date) have also been reported. 18 Oropos: pot from grave 6 of the Roman cemetery Rhamnous. V. Petrakos (Ergon 2001, 15-17) reports on the investigation of two Rom houses, each with courts and cisterns. The most interesting discoveries were of re-used spolia: an EC1 marble head, dating to the 5th Ct; part of a seated statue of Cybele (Hel?) and of a statue of Asklepios (or Amphiareus); and two Hel inscriptions. One records the second strategia (general- ship) of Euxitheos Philoxenides of Kephisos, and dates to 187-83 BC; the other is a decree honouring Aischron Amphikleous of Phyle, dating to just after 229 BC.

Graves 7, 16 and 17 were accompanied by reused inscribed grave stelai. Of particular interest is the re-use of earlier structures for grave coverings. Graves 2, 3, 18 and 24 re- used parts of the roof and entablature of the nearby Cl Temple of Nemesis at Rhamnous (fig. 19) and provide a terminus ante quem for its dismantling; grave 8 re-used Eleusinian marble from another, as yet unknown, Cl structure; grave 10 incorpo- rated parts of a nearby theatre; and grave 22 used part of a Hel decree recording an agreement between the Oropians and the Athenians which can be dated to the time of the archonship of Leukios of Rhamnous the younger (after 59/8 BC). Skala Oropou. A. Mazarakis Ainian (Ergon 2001, 26-37; 2002, 18-21) reports on the investigation of a second LGeo-EAr complex or compound, remarkably similar to one investigated earlier to the E. Like the earlier complex, this too comprised a rectangular wall enclosing two apsidal/oval houses, one smaller, one larger, the larger being about 10m in length, and indications of metalworking activity (fig. 20). No structures earlier than the mid 8th Ct BC were found, though there were scattered protoGeo an MGeo sherds. There were five phases of the compound, datable from the mid 8th to the mid 7th Ct BC. The earlier houses tend to be apsidal in plan, the later ones oval. The final phase of the complex can be associated with Rhodian SubGeo drinking cups of the 7th Ct BC (fig. 21) and remains of a bronze shield. Prof. Mazarakis Ainian draws attention to the similarity in plan of these two compounds with complexes excavated in Eretria (just across the channel) and Pithekoussai, and suggests that such walled compounds may plausibly be identified with the herkos mentioned in the Homeric poems. In 2002 heavy rains inundated the site, leaving an alluvial deposit, so work concentrated on study and conservation. ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF, KYTHERA AND ANTI-KYTHERA Salamis Both Ta Nea (25/6/2002) and Eleutheros Typos (1/12/2002) report the investigation of a Myc settlement on the SW tip of Salamis at Kanakia. The site is on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea, and was located in surface investigations by the University of Ioannina. Though an LH IIIB phase is mentioned, excavations seem to have concentrated on three structures which can be dated to LH IIIC (ca 1200-1150 BC), one as large as 25 x 17m. Finds include a sealstone, steatite beads, and a strainer jug. The site seems to have been abandoned after 1150 BC. Aigina E. Papastavrou, 2nd EPCA (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 101-2) reports on finds of Ar graves in two locations at Phaneromeni. On the Kakousi plot 23 LAr graves were found, mostly chamber tombs dating to the last decades of the 6th Ct. and first of the 5th Ct BC. The most distinctive was an earlier one (XVII) in a limestone sarcophagus containing a protoCor kotyle and iron pins. At the Pitsilou plot, an apparently similar grave in a limestone sarcophagus, apparently of a woman, containing 2 iron pins, 2 bronze finger rings, beads, a spindle whorl and 2 Cor aryballoi, could be dated to the end of the 7th Ct BC. F. Felten reports on the 2002 season of work by the Austrian Insititute at Kolonna: 'Works undertaken by the Institute for Classical Archaeology of Salzburg University, supervised by F. Felten and St. Hiller, concentrated on four areas: (1) The complete excavation of a building at the W tip of Cape Kolonna, identified by Welter in the 1930s as the Attaleion. This is a complex originally erected in the LAr peri- od, closely related in plan and building technique to the so- called priests houses' at the SE end of the acropolis (fig. 22). In both cases the ensemble consists of small covered rooms and open courtyards, with walls made of carefully worked poros orthostaths and mud-brick superstructure. Numerous votive objects - miniature skyphoi and lekythoi, fragments of alabaster vessels, terracottas, but also older imported ceramics of very high quality, including Chiote chalices (fig. 23) - indicate a sacral use of the area. Welter had found a number of omphalos- shaped coverings of offering pits, to which another example,</page><page sequence="14">14 JAMES WHITLEY 22 Kolonna, acropolis: late Archaic structure 23 Kolonna: Archaic Chiote chalice mlt -,- 24 Kolonna: middle Bronze Age settlement complex found in a collapsed position, can now be added. Welter's interpretation of the complex, on the basis of the inscription on one of the omphaloi, as a phra- tric sanctuary remains likely. A succession of floors and traces of repairs in small stones in the walls indicate that the complex retained its function at least into the advanced Cl period. The similarity between this ensemble and the 'priests' houses' in terms of architecture and finds, suggests that the whole S slope of the acropolis held buildings of sacral use throughout the Ar and Cl periods. In the Hel period, the S part of the complex was abandoned, filled with old mud-brick walling and covered with a paving that largely consists of reused architectural fragments. At the same time, a new structure, also using spolia and small hewn stones, was erected over the N part of the ensemble, on the old orthostathic structure, but with a slightly differ- ent orientation. With two covered chambers and an open court, this structure takes up the scheme of the abandoned older S area, transferring it to what orig- inally used to be an open court area. We found no further evidence regarding the function of the new building (Welter had based his interpretation of it as the Attaleion on a number of roof tiles with the monogram of Attalos) but the transferral of the old scheme to the new location suggests that it retained its old function. Finds under the slab paving include EHel ceramics as known from the W Slope, round- shouldered lamps and early relief pottery, indicating a date at the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 2nd Ct, and thus a link with the acquisition of Aigina by Pergamon, for the modifications. The new structure survived for a long time: during the secondary addi- tion of a drain made from upturned laconic roof-tiles and a connected repair of the paving's S edge, frag- ments of a LHel 'langblattbecher' were deposited between the paving stones. (2) Re-examination of the area of the PH 'innen- stadt', originally excavated in the 1930s, was com- pleted in 2002. Subsequently, the whole area has been backfilled to a homogenous level at the height of the earlier MBA, and conservation of the pre- served walls has begun. The visitor is now present- ed with a clear picture of a coherently planned MBA settlement complex traversed by a straight WE run- ning road system (fig. 24). In the SE part of this area, a pre-Hel (exact date unclear) cistern, 5.3m high, built of small poros blocks, and covered on its interior in a finely tem- pered hydraulic plaster of natural puzzolana, was excavated. Extending partially underneath the foun- dations of a Hel 'quaderbau' structure immediately to the E, it has three water chambers (1. ca 3m, h. 2m) pointing E, S and N from the main shaft. The N chamber's covering of poros slabs lies underneath PH walls, indicating construction by tunneling. Traces of later redesign (in the S chamber: an insu- lation of opus signinum covering containing pre- dominantly artificialpuzzolana, used in Greece since the later 3rd Ct BC) and vessels found on its floor (two small flat-bottomed amphoras and several large storage amphoras) indicate the cistern's use until EByz (fig. 25). (3) A new excavation was opened on the S Hill (where Furtwangler had removed LRom/Byz</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 15 remains in the early 20th Ct), aiming to create a link between the 1930s 'innenstadt' excavation and the ring of BA fortifications explored more recently by Walter and Felten, but also to estab- lish a detailed and continuous MBA stratigraphy, as well as to explore the S part of the MBA 'grosssteinbau', which may rep- resent the seat of the local authorities. A wide strip of foundation from smashed and reused poros material, lying in the axis E of the front of the Hel 'quaderbau' mentioned above, is almost certainly an altar belonging to the latter, thus marking it as a cult structure. Black fimis ware and W Slope ware, but also relief cups and fragments of terracottas found around the foundations indicate its date. On the South Hill, immediately underneath the remains of Hel structures on the 'siidhiigel', there are MBA strata, multiply pierced by Hel and later disturbances. Ar, Geo and Later Myc layers are completely absent. In nearly all areas the uppermost MBA walls and floors were covered by a thick layer of fallen and dissolved mud-brick, which may represent the remains of decayed mud-brick walls, a destruction level, or a deliberate levelling layer. Ceramic finds, including Aiginetan products with late matt painting and Cretan imports, date this remains to Later MBA. The 'grosssteinbau' itself appears to have undergone several modifications during each use; an MBA pottery kiln built into its S part was partially excavated in 2002 (fig. 26). (4) SE comer of the acropolis. Two soundings were placed in the area of Welter's 'priesterhiuser' near the SE comer of the acropolis to clarify the extent of PH remains noted in 2001. They indicate that the rocky slopes here had been terraced with single-faced walls, thus enlarging the settlement area and prov- ing the existence of a PH 'unterstadt' which probably continued all the way down to the harbour. Evidence for the date of these terraces comes from the sounding further to the SE: Here, an occupation layer was found directly on a floor, containing copious Myc material: monochrome red-painted and black- painted pottery, cooking wares, and a strikingly large amount of fragments from painted goblets and kylikes, as well as a few kraters, some fragments of idols, and part of a white slip bowl, a Cypriot import. The very homogenous Myc material dates to LH III A: 1/2.' Kea The Ministry of Culture has published a guide to Kea: Kea. Iozopia cKa apC%ati6reT?; (Athens, ARF, 2002). Poros Ta Nea (25/6/2002) reports briefly on an EH settlement at Kavo Vasilis. Dokos M. Petritaki, 2nd EPCA, reports (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 102-5) on surface investigations in this small island undertaken in 1997. Finds were concentrated in three locations. On the hill of Gouni, EH, Hel, LRom-ECh and Byz sherds, together with tiles of Cor type were found; at Vigla, PH sherds and obsidian were noted; and at Kakoteri (Agioi Apostoloi), PH, Hel, Rom, ECh and Byz sherds were found. Eleutherotypia (28/12/2002, 31-5) reports on underwater investigations, at a depth of 18-26m, which have revealed numerous almost complete EH pots, possibly from a EH wreck. Finds include bowls, incised ware, askoi and an amphora. Kythera A. Tsaravopoulos, 2nd EPCA (ADelt, 105-8) reports on rescue excavations, surface surveys and chance finds documented during 1997. 26 Kolonna: middle Bronze Age pottery kiln On the rocky islet of Antidragonara or Mikri Dragonara, sherds brought in by A. Kyrou prompted a rescue excavation in and around a small cave in the middle of the island. Pottery included Hel amphoras and Megarian bowls, which together with the 212 coins recovered were all datable to the 3rd-lSt Ct BC (fig. 27). The coins originated from all over the Mediterranean, from places as far apart as the Cimmerian Bosporus (Crimea) and Ibiza. The site was interpreted as a small sanctuary, visited by sailors, perhaps connected to the sanctuary of Poseidon at Cape Tanairon. On the nearby island of Megali Dragonara, signs of MByz, Cl and EBA habitation were found. Several EBA sites have now been located on the island. At Diakofti, surface finds of pottery and obsidian led to the inves- tigation of a cave (known as Chousti) with evidence of past human activity, close to which were finds of slag and a furnace of unknown date, possibly EBA. The rock-cuttings nearby seem to be of Cl date. Other EBA sites found through such informal</page><page sequence="16">16 JAMES WHITLEY 27 Kythera, Mikri Dragonara: fragments of Megarian bowls surface survey include Vani, near Agios Kosmas, Kalamitsi, and a site just N of Avlemona. Equally striking are the continuing indications of a Cretan or Minoan presence on the island from sometime in the MBA onwards. At Palaiopoli, as well as two graves, one certainly Hel in date from the Zamapitri plot, a small deposit of Minoan sherds was excavated at O. Fratsion-Avlemona. At Karavas, close to the farm of Kountouroyianni, a Minoan multi- chambered tomb was excavated in the location known as the Cave of Arapi. It was already known that an EMIII stone vase and LMI cup, both now in the National Museum, came from somewhere in this vicinity. The grave had been robbed, but LMI sherds and fragments of one steatite vessel were recovered. Surface investigations at the hill of Mermigkari, Katafygadi, revealed a cave used as a tomb with LM IB and LH IIIB pottery. L H finds were also recovered from one grave at Viaradika, on the Kampi tou Karava, while four more in the area were robbed. Surface investigations of various kinds have also located more sites of Cl-Hel quarries, particularly at Avlemona, Trachilos and Pheloti. Kythera survey. C. Broodbank (London, UCL) and E. Kiriatzi (Fitch Director, BSA) report on activities, conducted under the aegis of the BSA, for 2002: 'In 2001, the Kythera Island Project (KIP) had completed its intensive archaeological field survey of central-eastern Kythera, comprising ca 7800 tracts covering 43 km2 of the island and encountering ca 185 archaeological sites that reveal strong cycles of rural settlement and abandonment through time. The only fieldwork conducted in 2002 comprised a geoar- chaeological field season by Dr Charles Frederick and Dr Athanasia Krahtopoulou, assisted by Maria Kousoulakou. This completed coverage by KIP's team of geoarchaeologists of the most archaeologically rich and geomorphologically active parts of the survey area, through an intensive investigation of the Livadi basin and its vicinity, including mapping of bedrock types and soils, surface visibility, and the environs of archaeo- logical sites. Meanwhile, study of the material collected during survey pro- ceeded. Dr Cyprian Broodbank, Dr Alan Johnston, Dr Evangelia Kiriatzi and Dr Joanita Vroom made progress on the pottery from both the tracts and sites. One highlight of 2002 was the definition by Dr Kiriatzi of several reliable coarse- fabric criteria for identifying Mycenaean (Third Palace Period) sites, given the virtual absence of fine pottery at many of them. The impact of this break-through is evident in the much greater density of such sites now recognized within the NW part of the survey area where the criteria have so far been applied. Another significant feature was the increasing amount of Byz to E Venetian material identified. Aside from the pottery, an encour- aging start was also made on the study of the chipped stone by Dr Tristan Carter, and the ground stone by Soultana Gerousi. The lithics can be broken down into a range of material types, most of which should be susceptible to being provenanced. Chipped stone from the tracts suggests a predominance of obsidian but also a range of other local and imported types and in spatial terms distinguishes clearly between a marked coastal bias in the distribution of imported Melian obsidian versus an inland concentration of potential local materials. Dr John Bennet, Dr Siriol Davies and Debi Harlan worked on the published census records of the Venetian period. Exploration of this data spatially has provided insights into the shifting 18th Ct demographic patterns, and the structure of the Venetian administration. Meanwhile, Dr Andrew Bevan's GIS- based analysis of KIP data continued on a year-round basis, leading to several publications on subjects including the loca- tional strategies of Neopalatial farmsteads and (in conjunction with Dr James Conolly) the modelling of ceramic densities and concentrations in the landscape.' S.A. Paspalas (Australian Institute) and Prof. Tim Gregory (Ohio State University) report on field survey undertaken in 2002: 'The Paliochora-Kythera Archaeological Survey project, in its 4th season in 2002, aims to reach a better understanding of the occupational history of the N part of the island of Kythera, especifically in reference to the environs of the Med settlement of Agios Demetrios, (Paliochora). In 2002 substantial headway was made with regard to establishing the presence of PH mate- rial in this area. During the 2002 season considerable effort was spent in tracing the E mod. (and possibly older) road network within the survey area. Special attention was devoted to a number of the many churches which mark conspicuous spots of the landscape ofN Kythera. Work continued at Agios Georgios Kolokythias, a fortified complex with two churches (one standing), a cistern and remains of secular structures. Pottery and architecture indi- cate a Byz date (11th Ct AD) for the structure, but the study also revealed a PH, especially MLM, presence on the site. EH and M period pottery was also collected in the S of the survey area, in Ammoutses, E of the villages of Phriligianika and Kastrisianika, indicating considerable BA activity here. The presence EH finds raises the question of a possible Minoanization of an already existing population. Work also included the documentation of an E mod. water mill near Paliochora and Ms. L. Diacopoulos's (La Trobe University, Australia) research into the British and mod. periods, including the study of the mod. cemeteries in the study area. Antikythera A. Tsaravopoulos, 2nd EPCA (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 107-8) reports on the investigation of a Cl-Hel rock-cut shipshed found close to the known site of Kastro (whose Cl-Hel walls have long been known). As at the Cretan city of Phalassama there was a hidden harbour. Numerous coins of that city were found, and so the ship-shed may well be connected Phalassama, a notorious nest of pirates in Hel and ERom times.</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 17 KORINTHIA Perachora, Asprokambos. Z. Aslamatzidou-Kostourou, 4th EPCA (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 149) reports the discovery of eight Cl graves on the Asprokambos-Strava road, all limestone sarcophagi. The only unlooted tomb contained six vessels. All datable pottery was Cor of the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC. Loutraki, Katounistra (Segka plot). Z. Aslamatzidou- Kostourou (ADelt, 148-9) reports on excavation of a rectangu- lar room with a Rom mosaic, with geometric designs and a rep- resentation of a dolphin (fig. 28, see AR 2001-02, 21). Two coins and a lamp dated the structure to the 4th Ct AD. Poseidonia, Diolkos. Z. Aslamatzidou-Kostourou (ADelt, 148) reports on excavation of 21 LAr-Cl, mostly robbed, graves in the form of limestone sarcophagi in two locations. Eighteen graves were found 700m SW of the Diolkos, and three 120m S of it. Only four graves had not been robbed; they were sparsely furnished with kotylai and lekythoi. In grave 14 a handle of an EC1 bronze mirror of the Caryatid type was found (fig. 29). More sections of the Diolkos were also revealed. Isthmia, Sanctuary of Poseidon. Prof. B. Gebhard (Illinois/ ASCSA) reports on the 2002 season: 'Fritz Hemans and J. Stevens undertook experiments regard- ing the manufacture of the Ar tiles from the Archaic Temple. E. Gebhard studied the chronology and function of the Palaimonion based on archaeological, numismatic, and literary sources. The possibility that a roofed building stood in the cen- tral section of phase III was explored in relation to the con- struction sequence later buildings. The appearance of the Temple of Palaimon belonging to phase V on coins of Lucius Verus (160-167) fixes the end of phases III and IV; the archae- ological deposits related to the end of phase II places their ini- tiation in ca 100/120. 28 Loutraki: Roman mosaic 29 Poseidonia: early Classical bronze mirror handle F. Hemans and Iota Kassimi (4th EPCA) prepared plans for the reorganization of the Isthmia museum exhibits, and E. Gebhard, R. Hemans, C.

A 210m long stretch of wall with four towers had been uncovered in earlier work, and was extended by a further 80m and two towers on bedrock. Spolia (recorded here) was used in the construction, possibly from the temple of Poseidon at Isthmia. A Latin inscription found reads: VSEXTIA CNLCYTHERIS / CNSEXTIOC NCNLPYTADE- PVRI / RARIO CAMPAMO VIRO ET / CNSIXTIC NEMAXI- MOPILIO POSTIRISO V / SVIS Evidence for the original Theodosian foundation was found at parts of the wall (5th Ct AD), as well as for repairs dating to Manuel 11 (1391-1425). Kenchreai, Koutsongilla. Prof. J.L. Rife (ASCSA/Comell University) reports on the 2002 season of ASCSA excavations: 'We conducted a preliminary study of a Rom cemetery on the ridge called Koutsongilla N of the anc. harbour at Kenchreai</page><page sequence="18">18 JAMES WHITLEY 30 Koutsongilla-Kenchreai: tomb 4, painted interior on the Saronic Gulf in early June, 2002. The cemetery has been previously noted (Georgios Lampakis, Christian Archaeological Society 1906) and selectively explored (R.L. Scranton, Kenchreai I: Topography and Architecture (Leiden 1978), 11-12, pl. IX), but for many years it has been subjected to frequent looting. Our research aims to elucidate the develop- ment of funerary practices, of the local topography, and of society in the area. Work took place under the supervision of the 4th EPCA at Nauplion. We determined that looters have opened 22 subterranean chamber tombs and 17 inhumation cists in an elongated zone on the E slope of the ridge measuring approximately 120m N/S x 35m E/W. Within this area we examined all burial sites; com- piled extensive descriptions and scaled drawings of four of them; photographed all exteriors and several interiors; cleaned the partly exposed surface remains of two mortuary features; and prepared a GPS-based area plan of these 39 discrete burial sites. Finally, we observed the traces of past and present plun- dering and illicit excavation. The chambers mostly have the same plan: loculi or arcoso- lia in the lower register of the walls and niches for cinerary urns in the upper register, many have benches or tables along the walls. The tombs closely resemble several ERom tombs that have been found in the vicinity of Corinth near the Leukas river, in the area of Kokkinovrysi, and in the excavations by S. Charitonides alongside the Patras National Highway. Three of the chambers on Koutsongilla preserve wall-painting, one with simple geometric forms and two with programs offaux archi- tecture, hanging garlands, mythical creatures, and marine motifs (fig. 30). The descending staircases (dromoi) were enclosed at the surface by low barrel vaults in uneven brick masonry and covered by square buildings with side walls of rubble and mortar, monumental fagades with ashlar founda- tions, and perhaps gabled roofs, like naiskoi. The tombs may have been aligned roughly in separate rows running N/S, thus being plainly visible on approaching the harbour by land or sea. The study also found that the inhumation graves outside the chamber tombs were of three basic types: a stone-lined and slab-covered cist; a rock-cut shaft with a square opening at the E end (foot) covered by a slab; and a shaft cut obliquely into a slope to create an interior chamber. The last two forms date exclusively to late antiquity, as is demonstrated by parallels from Lema Hollow and the Gymnasium area at Corinth and from Isthmia, Solygeia, and Zygouries. We also recorded a battered LRom sarcophagus cut from the local oolitic limestone, perhaps in the quarries ca 500m to the W, probably removed long ago from one of the chambers for re-use as a basin or trough. These individual graves are distributed slightly W and upslope from the chamber tombs, and may rep- resent a later phase, when single cists were added around the unoccupied edges of the pre-existing cemetery.' Eastern Korinthia survey. Prof. Tim Gregory (Ohio/ASCSA) reports on the 2002 season: 'Under the direction of Professors Daniel J. Pullen (Florida State University) and Timothy E. Gregory (Ohio State University), the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey conducted field- work and museum study in June and July 2002 as follows: Vayia (LOCA 9035). Widely spread across a large, gently sloping hill overlooking the Saronic Gulf between two small coves known as Lychnari (to the W) and Vayia (to the E), this is a scatter of collapsed walls and structures, as well as pottery and some ground stone implements. Periods represented are primarily EH II and E mod., along with LH, Cl, and Rom in certain areas. Much of the EH II pottery has calcium carbonate crusting, like many stones in the features. The principal architectural remains seem to be a series of round structures, probably collapsed tow- ers, connected by walls, situated on the hilltop, and associat- ed with EH II pottery. Modifications and more construction occured in later periods, up to E mod. Some 100m to the W, another set of walls overlooking Lychnari Bay appears to be Cl (LOCA 9232), as are owers on adjacent hilltops to W of Lychnari Bay (LOCA 9233) and S of Vayia (LOCA 9156), indicating a substantial fortification of the area around Lychnari Bay during the Cl period. Vigla. Located on top of a ridge overlooking the Saronic Gulf and a marsh, just to the E of Kato Almyri, this area con- tained a number of features (a threshing floor, rock piles, a basin, cut stone blocks, the course of a wall, and rubble walls); the ridge-top (DUs 2070-2077) has two rock-cut basins (one cylindrical, the other rectangular), a large cut block and an unfluted column and is distinguished by very high densities of mainly Cl artefacts, found mostly in low rubble piles which may represent the remains of structures. Agia Aikaterini/Lakka Skoutara. The small upland basin E of Sophiko, locally known as Lakka Skoutara (or Agia Aikaterini) incorporates a variety of landscapes. The area is not rich in artefacts, but there was a substantial Final Neo presence in the SW (the first such site found by EKAS), much Med in the middle, and scattered remains of other periods including Myc, Greek (Ar and Cl), Rom, and E mod. Many E mod. structures were also documented. Geophysical Studies. During the 2002 season, magnetometry and resistivity prospection, supervised by Dr Apostolos Sarris (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas, Institute for Mediterranean Studies, Rethymnon) took place on three loca- tions. Analysis of the data is ongoing, but preliminary com- ments can be summarized here. (1) in the E part of Kromna, a site with archaeological remains and high surface artefact densities including ceramics characteristic of local Cl and Hel sanctuaries, results were inconclusive, revealing no clear traces of an architectural com- plex (although there may be one in the NW), but a number of kilns and other features.</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 19 31 Corinth: plan ofPanayia Field excavation (2) A possible cemetery, in use at various periods from Geo to Rom times, on an adjacent ridge at the S extent of Kromna, with no clear anomalies. The pattern of magnetic highs may be caused by trees or looting trenches. (3) A field with massive quantities of mainly Rom to LMed rooftiles and sherds, just N of the Rachi Boska ridge in the loca- tion Perdikaria, was investigated at the request of the Ephoreia. It clearly shows a very large (1. over 30m) anomaly, almost certainly a building, near the top (N) of the grid, con- sisting of a long, linear feature trending NW-SE. Interior rooms are visible. A second, less striking, anomaly to the S may repre- sent a second structure with different orientation.' Anc. Corinth, Diavatiki. (I. Kallia and M. Soukouli plot) Z. Aslamatzidou-Kostourou (ADelt, 147) reports on excavation of a two-phased Rom-LRom structure. The first Rom phase dates to the ISt-2nd Ct AD, the later rebuilding to the 5th and 6th Cts. A 6th Ct child's burial provides a terminus ante quem for the use of the structure. Anc. Corinth. Dr Guy Sanders (ASCSA) reports on the 2002 season: 'In 2002, excavations continued in the Panayia Field where, in recent years, the remains of a 4th Ct Rom town house with mosaics, wall painting and small-scale sculpture, late antique buildings including a small bath structure, some fragmentary remains of Med occupation, a 17th Ct cemetery and several E to mid-19th Ct houses have been uncovered (fig. 31). Ten more graves of the mixed Moslem and Christian 17th Ct cemetery brought the total number of interments to about 100. One of the graves contained another individual (in addition to the three previously found) who had met an early and violent death and was buried only after rigor had set in. On the extreme E side of the property we excavated Rom road beds, cut by Med storage pits, a broad deep 12th Ct robbing trench and major drainage repair works of the 5th and especially 6th Ct The later features had been shaved back by ploughing and erosion in the post Med period; the latest pre- served road beds were of the E 3rd Ct. The road was metalled but never paved. In the 1st Ct, successive gravel deposits were laid against the wall flanking the road to the W. A paved porch gave access to a room to the W. In the later 1St Ct some event caused a number of large squared blocks to be deposited in the road. Some of these were used to construct a kerb defining the side-walk about 2m from the W wall while others were left where they fell. Similarly, a kerb was built around the paved porch to create a downward step. Earth was dumped behind the newly constructed kerbs covering the remaining fallen blocks and graveled over. Thereafter, a succession of water pipes were laid and covered with new road surfaces, which were re-cut for pipeline repairs, new pipelines and even to rob pipelines. Each of these phases is associated with subsequent rebedding. Under the floors of the mid-Rom house were found the scrappy remains of 1st to 3rd Ct structures including another well and a lime pit. The lime pit, used for storing and mixing wall plaster, consisted simply of a rectangular hole into which the lime was dumped and is defined only by the plaster left adhering to its sides when emptied. It was backfilled with large fragments of the decorative fresco that the new plaster replaced and was sealed with a plaster floor. The robbing trench of one wall of this phase excavated in 2001 revealed large stones covering a cavity that appeared to be a grave, for which a Geo date was correctly suggested because of three substantially complete Geo oenochoai and a table amphora found in adjacent LRom disturbances (fig. 32). The grave, excavated in 2002, was extensively damaged by Hel and</page><page sequence="20">20 JAMES WHITLEY Hellenistic Disturbance- h &lt; ..- , ^ Geometric Tomb 2002-11 32 Corinth: plan of Geometric tomb Rom disturbances. The filling of a well in the Hel period revealed part of the E side of the grave its sarcophagus, prompt- ing the discoverers to break the lid and rifle the grave contents leaving only a tiny stone bead behind. The sarcophagus lid was broken into two parts; one half was dumped into the well, the other half was allowed to rest displaced on top of the sarcopha- gus. The excavation of foundations for the Rom room cut away some of the grave fill on a N-S line as deep as the lid and when the foundations were robbed out in the 3rd Ct the lid was again exposed. The construction of the mid-Rom domus in the second half of the 3rd Ct cut away the S end of the grave including the S end of the sarcophagus. Finally, 6th Ct robbing of the domus wall re-exposed the sarcophagus and it was partially filled with earth and fresco fragments when the trench was back-filled. In addition to the three broken oenochoai found in previous sea- sons two more broken oenochoai were found in the Hel distur- bance. Careful removal of these anc. disturbance contexts left a surprisingly substantial portion of the grave intact. Preserved in situ is a very large sarcophagus of sandy lime- stone with interior dimensions (0.7 x 1.6m, d. 0.7m) (est 1.4 tonnes) probably centrally placed within a grave cut of 2.3m by a restored length of 3.8m. After the sarcophagus had been posi- tioned, the N end of the cut was backfilled with small boulders covered with a layer of marl clay to the lip of the sarcophagus, providing a ramp to facilitate the placement of a very heavy oolitic limestone (est 0.8 tonnes) cover slab. With the slab in place, filling of the grave resumed and vessels used during the burial liturgy were carefully placed upright against the side of the cut. There were two oinochoai, each with a cup, a skyphos and a kyathos respectively, set upright in their mouth in the NE comer; two decorated amphoras, one with an upright skyphos in its mouth, the other largely complete but substantially cut away by the Rom construction and robbing trench, on the W side; and a hydria (or transport amphora) on the E side. Two small aryballoi were thrown, into the fill on the N side. No trace of charcoal or ash was found. The date of the grave is EGeoI or ca 875 BC +/- 25. The sarcophagus is the largest EGeo example found to date at Corinth. With ten vessels in situ and five displaced oenochoai, it was clearly a rich assemblage, including contain- ers for oil, water and wine, as well as cups, possibly representing burial-related drinking, libation or both. Possibly reserved for the burial liturgy, the vessels were perhaps buried to remove them from mundane use. Since the oenochoai and amphoras were placed upright with cups in their mouths, they plausibly still retained some of their contents when buried. The information should allow to reconstruct the sequence of events and grave-side ritual. Remote sensing survey in collaboration with Dr M. Boyd of the Fitch Laboratory (BSA) continued in the area of the LRom city wall E of the village (Hesperia 48 (1979)). Nearly the entire extent of the wall from the Argos road N to the cliff of upper ter- race was revealed, including several towers; a long -- . linear structure parallel and to the E of the wall in one long section appears to represent the line of a prote- ichisma wall. A section excavated in 1930 revealed what may be the concrete cores and robbing trenches where the facing stones of both walls were removed, and a silted in space between them. The course of the wall as traced does not follow the line as previously reconstructed but instead strikes NW to the terrace at a point where the edge of the cliff turns N for about 50m, and then E towards the amphitheatre. From this point the line of the wall presumably heads W along the edge of the terrace so that no part of the area enclosed was overlooked by the N extension of the terrace to the E. In fact the wall may well have not continued to the edge of the lower terrace. Strong linear features and features previously reported, such as part of a LRom bath and a martyrium or baptistry indicate the importance of this area in late antiquity. Recent excavations by the EBA, partially guided by the remote sensing data are con- firming this potential.' Lechaion.

Dr Torsten Matter (DAI /Marburg) reports on the 2002 season: 'In 2000 and 2001 we cleaned and documented the Hel Temple of Herakles outside of the anc. city and excavated by Frickenhaus in 1910 (figs. 33, 34). In 2002, work, in collabora- tion with Jeanette Marchand and the 4th EPCA, under the direc- tion of Dr A. Mantis, and with the support of Evangelia Pappi, concentrated on the so-called Temple of Athena on the E hill (partially explored in 1910) a landmark building of anc. Kleonai. Remains of a 25 x 1 Om building were uncovered. The foundation was loosely constructed with secondary building material, suggesting a date in late antiquity. The spolia derived from a Doric (L) Cl structure (seven metope-triglyph blocks, an architrave, and probably a capital found separately) and a Ionic Hel building (one column drum, three half-column drums with projections of a crosswall).'</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 21 ?I~-/ //" - ?\ \ 9 /, v 7/ \' 'xX \ \ \/,r\'&amp; Q#1 I\\ ~ A X -.

Joseph Maran (DAI/Heidelberg) re the 2002 survey season: 'The final season of the archaeological and geo-arc ical survey in the Phlious basin took place under the of Professsor Joseph Maran and Prof. Gunther (Heidelberg). Due to difficulties caused by the wet work was restricted to the hillslopes surrounding the b the PH site, covered by later deposits, on the summ mountain range of Koukouyeras (650m asl) and at the S edge of the basin (first discovered 1999), a number of PH finds, mainly flint and obsidian frag- ments, were found. Two tanged arrowheads indi- cate a LNeo or Chalcolithic date for the begining of the settlement. Surprisingly, the S side of a minor SE peak was found to be fortified by a wall (1. ca 65m) with four bastions, dated to the 5th and 4th Cts BC, i.e. contemporary with the fortification wall constructed along the ascent of the main peak. The extension and the finds suggest that it may be a refuge rather than a purely military fortification. At a Neo site at the foot of the Koukouyeras, numerous flints and four grinding stones were found, supporting its interpretation as a settlement. Traces of intensive cutting were detected in a rock outcrop at the lower section of a slope above the road between Petri and Aidonia, in an area that most likely once belonged to Byz Petri. PH, 'Cl' and Byz finds col- lected on the terraced hills surrounding this site indi- cate that it was inhabited throughout antiquity but most intensively in Rom and Byz times. The most important Myc site of the valley is Aidonia, where Kalliopi Krystalli-Votsi excavated a chamber-tomb necropolis consisting of 20 graves containing many grave goods. The area is probably the origin of the celebrated Aidonia Treasure returned by the US authorities and exhibited in the National Museum in 1996. In 1999, the acropolis of Aidonia was discovered by our survey on a spur NW of the cemetery, and conformed through trial excavation by the 4th EPCA. 34 Kleonai: temple of Herakles from the northeast a A N A,. / HeNsTempd \ 't / - B r, f-, I 1- -r / .\ , . / / / / /' / / ./ / / J I</page><page sequence="22">22 JAMES WHITLEY 35 Phlious: looted Mycenaean tholos tomb The discovery of three opened and looted Myc graves, a tholos and two probable chamber tombs at the lower slope of the SW end of the valley, W of the road to Leontion came as a surprise (fig. 35). Study of the survey finds appears to indicate a hierarchical structure to Myc settlement in the Phlious basin. Some results were presented to the public at a Greco-German symposium on the 21st of September in Leontion.' Stymphalos. Prof. Hector Williams, (Canadian Institute) reports on the 2002 season: 'A study season concerned itself with conservation and study of a variety of material, from coins to pottery to figurines, but especially with an extensive area of fallen wall plaster, much of it drafted into rectangular panels, from the E Rom house uncov- ered in 2001 in the SE area of the city. The process of cleaning and reassembling the more than 80 crates of this material was begun. Cleaning up the site also recovered more bronze door bosses similar to the 30+ uncovered in 2001 in the Rom house.' Environs of Stymphalos. Cave of Lafka Ch. Piteros (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 153-4) reports on investigation of a cave which had been looted by tomb robbers. The recovery of pot- tery (including Cor skyphoi), figurines and bronze fragments of Ar date indicate that this cave may have been used as sanctuary. ARGOLIS Lerna. Prof. M.H. Wiencke reports on study conducted by the ASCSA in 2002: 'Prof. Banks has made progress in preparing, the Lera IV publication, and is working on the Neo evidence. Replacing Prof. Morris, Prof. Erickson has been studying the post-Myc ceramics, an impressive sequence of decorated pot- tery from the 9th to the 4th Ct BC, as well as sporadic later mate- rial. For the Ar and Cl periods, Lera has the potential to become a major type site for ceramic development in this part of Greece. His initial impression is that most of the pottery of light buff clay is Argive, but Cor, Laconian, and Attic imports occur at Lerna in surprisingly large numbers. David Scahill of the Agora Excavations team will assist with the study of the post-Myc architectural fragments. Prof. Vitelli has nearly completed her study of the Neo ceramics; Carol Zerner is editing the manuscript of Lerna V, Dr Michael Lindblom (Swedish Institute) will organize the publi- cation of Lera VI. Other scholars using Lerna material in 2002 included Lorenz Rahmstorf (Heidelberg), for a dissertation on LBA small finds from Tiryns; Michalis Catapotis (Sheffield), for his study on BA bronzes; Sophia Voutsaki (Cambridge) for a study of MH funerary assemblages (including C14 and DNA testing).' Argos. In several locations, rescue excavations revealed protoGeo, LGeo, Ar and Hel graves and Rom-ECh structures. Ch. Piteros (ADelt, 130-3) reports on excavations in two locations: Parodos Iakovou Manou (O.T. 24, E and A. Xizi plot). Under some LByz levels (two kilns and one robbed tomb), excavation concentrated on a large LRom-ECh structure with two phases, the earlier being 5th - 6th Ct AD, the later EByz. Associated finds include EC1 marble basins. This structure in both phases incorporated spolia from an earlier LCl-Hel building of the 4th/3rd Ct BC. Lower levels were full of redeposited Rom, Hel, Cl, Ar and LGeo sherd material and several graves. These were; one LGeo-EAr child's enchytrismos; one robbed LAr cist grave (containing the lip of a bronze bowl); and two graves accom- panied by limestone gravestones. The first of these contained LCl-Hel alabastra, black glaze cups, figurines and bronze nails; the second two LAr Cor pyxides. Other funerary monuments were found re-used; one lengthy marble funerary inscription (undated) mentioning a certain Baoersov; one LCl-EHel (4th/3rd Ct BC) limestone stele of Aristokra[tous]; and an LAr marble funerary stele, found in two parts, apparently of Attic manufac- ture, showing a man in low relief (fig. 36). O. Kallergi 27 (A. Vlogiari - E. Christakou plot): A relief with a representation of Asklepios and Hygeia, together with two snakes, found in a later Byz deposit may be identified with a relief mentioned by Pausanias (11.23, 2-5). Alkistis Papadimitrou, 4th EPCA (ADelt, 133-9) reports on discoveries in four locations: 0. 4 Ianouariou 1833 (D. Yiaranti-E.

One Hel child's enchystrismos; one EGeo inhumation in a cist grave, accompanied by steatite beads, two bronze pins and four bronze finger rings; and one LGeo inhumation with two kraters. O. Papalexopoulou (M.

Clarisse Protre (French School) reports continued study of the epigraphical material in 2002, in order to create a new IG corpus, which will also include Argive inscriptions exhibit- ed in Athens (with kind permission by Dr Kritsas, Director of the Epigraphic Museum). Anna Philippa-Touchais and Gilles Touchais (French School) report on the work conducted in 2002 on the Hill of Aspis in Argos: 'In 2002 we continued to analyse and catalogue materials from the excava- tions of Aspis. We focused on the matt painted pottery from the N sector, but also conducted a preliminary study of pottery found, in the SE in 2001. A prelimi- nary examination of this material permits some observations on the distri- bution of different types of 36 Argos: Archaic funerary stele pottery during different settlement phases; thus, for example, the proportion of imported pottery is greater in the oldest phase (MH I-II). Faunal remains will be studied by A. Gardeisen. Pottery analysis has been conducted .by the laboratory of Archaeometry of the Dimokritos Centre of Scientific Research, in collabora- tion with the Fitch Laboratory of the BSA. The results have been presented by the authors (V. Kylikoglou, E. Kiriatzi, A. Philippa-Touchais, G. Touchais and I. K. Whitbread) at the 9th International Aegean Meeting, from the 18-21 April 2002, organized by R. Laffineur and K. P. Foster at the University of Yale, New Haven (USA). In the process of general cleaning works by the French School on the Karmoyannis Property at the request of the Ephoreia, the W part of trench AM 75 was noticed to have col- lapsed. With special permission from the Ephoreia, R. Le Mer conducted a small excavation in August 2002. The collapsed section, ranging between 0.5m and 0.7m in height, was found to contain the following: Paving in elaphropetra (US 02/101): squared slabs (w. 60cm side, 6cm th.), at 11.52-11.59m asl on top of a layer of very compressed earth. This paving corresponded approximately to the soil level found in AM 74 (11.75m asl), which is attributed to a second phase. It is likely that this paving corresponds to the inside floor of an altered building. In the middle of the baulk, the paving lay on a layer of tile fragments set on edge, mixed with little stones. The S part of the collapsed baulk yielded a small quantity of heterogenous ceramics (Hel black-painted and W Slope, common ceramics of the 2nd and the 3rd Cts AD). The tile bedding, mixed with red- dish earth, also contained, mostly Rom (1st-2nd Ct AD) sherds. Excavation was stopped on reaching a fill identified in 2001, on a gravelling apparently in situ (11.30m asl).' K. Barakari-Gleni, 4th EPCA (ADelt, 139-42) reports on con- tinuing excavations in Thesi Synoro, about llkm NW of Argos, where earlier work had revealed signs of Ar and Cl cemeteries. Investigations, involving topographical survey and trial trenching, took place in two locations. At Toumbaki (Y. Koika plot) one cist grave (undated) containing three adults, walls, and sherds of LGeo and Cor LAr and Cl pottery were recovered. In the fields of Ch. Nezou and P. Kosma six LAr-ECl graves in rectangular cists built of limestone slabs were found. Grave 1 had three skeletons, a Cor pyxis and a black figure Attic droop cup; grave 2 was of a child; grave 5 had four skulls but no finds; and the grave in the Nezou plot had two phases, the first LAr-ECl with three burials and attic black fig- ure pottery; the second having two skeletons. Mycenae. Excavations continued in two locations in 2001 and 2002, under the auspices of the ASA, and the direction of Professor Sp. Iakovidis (Ergon 2001, 38-43; 2002, 22-6). Acropolis, N wall.

At this location, on the NE of the site outside the walls of the acropolis, excavation revealed walls and sherds largely of LH IIIA2 date; fragments of wall paintings were also found. In one location a deposit of bones was found with LH IIIB pottery. In 2002 a large circular hole revealed finds of LH IIIA2. The most significant find of the 2001 season was a frag- ment of a large coarse ware stirrup jar inscribed with Linear B [pa-ti-me-ro] (fig. 37).

Excavations jointly conducted by the Swedish Institute and the Greek Archaeological Service contin- ued in 2002 under the direction of Dr Katie Demakopoulou, Mrs Nicoletta Divari-Valakou and Dr Ann-Louise Schallin (see also reports in Eleutheros Typos, 20/12/2002 and To Vima 7/7/2002). Dr Schallin reports for the Swedish excavations around the east gate (also preliminarily published in Opuscula Atheniensia): 'Trench 4 (outside the east gate). A line of Cyclopean boul- ders forming the W part of the trench seems to represent the W facade of a foundation for a wall ramp, serving to access the gate. A road may have approached the entrance from the N, then turned E to head straight towards the ramp and gate. Mixed Neo to Byz ceramics occurred in the area (fig. 38). Some Geo sherds may indicate a special purpose activity in the east gate area. Sherds found immediately above and between the stones in the fill are mainly M and LH, pointing to a Myc date for the ramp. A terminus post quem for the date of its construction is provid- ed by an almost intact small handmade vase, typical of LH IIIB (FS 126), found in the bottom of a bedrock pocket under the fill. Trenches 5, 6, 7 and 8 (inside the east gate). Evidence for a LH floor level was noted inside the gate in trenches 5, 6 and 7. The floor consists of a 3-6cm thick layer of very compact soil, with a hard pebbly surface; it contains pottery sherds with a preliminary dating to LH III, some animal bones, shells and obsidian flakes. Below the floor there was a compact, clayish soil, dark reddish brown in colour and with few finds, including pottery fragments with preliminary dating to MH and ELH. This layer, seemingly reaching all the way down to bedrock, probably represents the fill for the earliest phase of the LH floor in the gate. The worn upper surfaces of the bedrock outcroppings, exposed at various places inside the gate, seem to have been incorporated into the LH floor level, the protruding upper sur- faces either used as stepping stones or as support for some kind of substructure. The pottery, generally worn, included Neo, MH, LH and L Rom; among other finds there was a fragment of a decorated terracotta female figurine (proto-Phi type). Trench 8, in close proximity to the east gate, among a tum- ble of stones that constituted a structure connected with the citadel wall, was laid out to investigate the communication between the east gate area and the upper plateau. A large slab sticking out from the citadel wall, first thought to be a threshold block, probably just constituted a bond between the citadel wall and the bedrock ca lm to the S. It may have supported the comer of the citadel wall at this point, but may also have served as the foundation of a path above it, especially as the bedrock was carved to support a second block on top of the surviving slab. Finds are mixed MH and LH; L Rom sherds are either intrusive, or caused by Rom disturbances. Excavations E of the east gate. Two trenches, 3 and 9, were excavated on one of the upper near a line of LH store rooms built against the citadel wall (known from earlier excavations). No structures have so far been recognized in trench 9, but work in trench 3 was largely completed. In the previous campaign, three walls of Myc date had been partly uncovered. Two of these, wall 1 along the N scarp and wall 2 along the W scarp, together with the citadel wall, form the N part of a room with high foundations of small and middle-sized stones. The room is presumably similar in date and function to the storage rooms further N. Wall 3, however, is parallel to wall 2, but on a lower level and runs slightly more to the E. It consists of only two courses, the upper course being of unusually large stone slabs, the lower one made up of small stones. The latest datable sherds below wall 3 belong to LH IIIA2. A floor level, hard and pink- ish buff in colour but lacking finds, was reached.

Except for the intrusion described below, all finds belonged to the Myc destruction layer that filled up the rooms along the fortification. Many periods, from Neo to LH IIIB2 or later, are represented, as are L Rom and Byz intrusions. The EH sherds include fragments of EH III patterned painted ware. MH and LH cooking wares are represented, including Aeginetan cook- ing ware with gold mica inclusions. A number of other MH wares were recognized, such as Argive dark burnished, coarse burnished incised (Adriatic Ware), dark-on-light, light-on-dark, lustrous decorated and mainland polychrome. Some fragments from the transitional phase between MH and LH also occur, as well as E Myc ware. The latest Myc sherds belong to rosette bowls and group B deep bowls of LH IIIB2. The filling con- sisted of soil with a high content of ashes, but in the E part, close to the fortification wall, it was more dark brown in colour and contained many small and middle-sized stones. The stones had probably fallen from the walls and the dark soil originated from the wall mortar. As for the ashy soil, this is where most sherds and small finds occured. Many large pithos sherds from several incomplete containers lay close to floor level (fig. 39).' Katie Demakopoulou reports for the Greek excavations: 'The excavations were conducted in the SW part of the acropolis, in the west gate area and on the SW slope (Greek Sector) The most significant discoveries formed part of a drainage system in the area of the SW Slope. In the west gate area, in a trench adjacent to the inner face of the fortification wall, a long wall defines the NE side of a room built against the fortification. Its floor, of trodden earth mixed with clay, was much damaged by fallen stones and big stone blocks from the fortifications. Some vases were found smashed under the stones, including an amphoriskos with linear decora- tion, a deep bowl with linear decoration, a storage stirrup jar with dark-on-light linear decoration and large fragments of pithoi and vats. They suggest that the structures in this trench were destroyed in the final phase of the LH IIIB2 period, when a devastating earthquake struck Midea. The pottery from the debris of the room and other excavated parts of the trench is mostly LH IIIB2, with typical shapes of fine ware, like deep bowls and stemmed-bowls, kraters, jugs and stirrup jars. Coarse ware pottery was also plentiful with many fragments of storage and cooking vessels. A fragment of a jar with applique cordon and horse-shoe handle, both bearing finger impressions, is a typical example of the much-discussed 40 Midea: handmade - ! burnished ware fragment handmade burnished ware (fig. 40), which is thus represented in a LH IIIB2 context at Midea. Other finds are fragments of a lead vessel, terracotta roof tiles, fragments of handmade clay human figurines and of a wheelmade animal figure, stone and bone tools, obsidian and flint blades, fragments of painted plaster and pieces of semi-precious stones, including a piece of haematite with traces of cutting. On the SW Slope, on a plateau N of the W Gate, where a complex of rooms had been uncovered in previous campaigns, more rooms were found, comprising two buildings, constructed on a large terrace, defined to the NW by a long, wide road and to the SE by an inclined space with uneven stone pavement. Piles of stones and remains of damaged walls in that space, and in the two buildings, indicate destruction by earthquake. The building to the NE consists of five rooms; one of them is spa- cious with a wide doorway. Fresco fragments found outside this room probably belonged to its walls. The other room pre- served its floor, with on remarkable objects, such as a fragmen- tary coarse basin containing bones of sheep or goat and a large mushroom-shaped sword pommel of white marble, almost intact but with pronounced traces of burning (fig. 41). The debris inside and outside the rooms contained abundant LH IIIB2 pottery, including much decorated pottery in the usual shapes. Undecorated shapes include kylikes, angular bowls and dippers, but coarse ware, with many examples of storage and cooking vessels, predominates. Two fragments of a handmade burnished ware jar with horizontal applique cordon bearing incisions were found, and also fragments of handmade clay human and animal figurines and a fragmentary medium-sized terracotta wheelmade female figure with raised arms. There were also bronze and obsidian arrow-heads, a bronze knife 41 Midea: burnt marble sword pommel m I 't..i</page><page sequence="26">26 JAMES WHITLEY 42 Tiryns: the 'north passage' blade, stone and bone tools, spindlewhorls of steatite, many fragments of painted and plain plaster, and pieces of semi- precious stones, such as agate, rock crystal and fluorite, some with traces of cutting, as well as an amygdaloid sealstone of agate, very well preserved, depicting two seated bovids. Of the SW building, three rooms were excavated. One of them, maybe a light-well, contained a drainage system, obvi- ously part of larger network that served this area. The uncov- ered part consists of a cistern, cut into the bedrock, and a drain built of large stones and covered with heavy slabs. Many stones were found fallen in the cistern, including a fragmentary Myc stone column base. The ceramic material from the cistern and the drain was Myc, mostly LH IIIB2. Abundant LH IIIB2 pottery and other finds were recovered from the accumulated deposits in the rooms and adjacent areas. The painted pottery includes deep bowls of Group A, kraters, mugs, alabastra, globular stirrup jars and a partly restored strainer jug decorated with a pictorial scene of bovids on the shoulder. The undecorated pottery includes numerous kylikes, cups, angular bowls and dippers. The commonest coarse ware shapes are storage stirrup jars, pithoi and vats. Other finds are a fragment of a serpentine vessel, spindlewhorls and papyrus- shaped steatite beads, fragmentary clay figurines, bronze nee- dles, stone and bone tools, blades and flakes of obsidian and flint, lead clamps for the mending of clay vessels, fragments of plain plaster, pieces of mother-of-pearl, three relief beads of glass and other plain beads of the same material, as well as unworked pieces of rock crystal, fluorite and green steatite. These finds suggest the existence of workshops operating on the acropolis of Midea.' Environs of Midea. At Amygdalitsa, Ch.

Joseph Maran (DAI/Heidelberg) reports on work in the 2002 season: 'In the lower citadel of Tiryns, the excavations at the north gate were continued under the direction of Professor Joseph Maran from the end of July to the beginning of October 2002. Excavation was necessitated by construction work in connection with the planned restoration programme and the development of the site. The campaign improved our knowledge of the patterns of use of the N area of the lower citadel in the decades between the erection of the Cyclopean fortification around 1250 BC and the time after the destruction of the Palace in ca 1200 BC. The entrance of a tunnel (north passage) was discovered about 4.40m W of the north gate (fig. 42). The tunnel is partly covered by corbel vaulting and runs obliquely through the for- tification wall, thus connecting the lower citadel with the N lower town; 8m 1., 0.9m h., and 0.78-1.5m w., it is stepped and winds slightly. The best parallel is the so-called north gallery at Mycenae, it is also approximately contemporary with the Cyclopean wall of the lower citadel of Tiryns. Both probably served as sally ports. In the area bordering on the passage-way leading to the north gate, a sequence of architectural remains of the palatial period and the post-palatial period (the 13th and 12th Cts BC) was uncovered (fig. 43). Two finds indicate the involvement of Tiryns in long-distance trade networks: a sherd of an imported M stirrup jar inscribed with Linear B, deriving from a level dat- ing to LH IIIB 1 or the earlier part of LH IIIB2; and the fragment of a rod with circular section consisting of bone or ivory and bearing marks resembling cuneiform writing, found in a destruction deposit of the end of LH IIIB2. At least three skele- tons were deposited in a pit without any grave offerings in the first horizon of LH IIIC, following the destruction of the settle- ment around 1200 BC. Interestingly, at least one was buried when his flesh had partially or completely decomposed. This seems to indicate that the human remains were deposited in the course of the cleanup that took place after the catastrophe, and may thus represent a victim of the disaster.'

A.V. Karapanayiotou (ADelt, 200-06) notes work in three locations: At the junction of Archaiou Theatrou and Epikouriou Apollonos (Tsougkou plot): remains of Hel house with small fragment of mosaic floor, and fourteen later (LHel-Rom?) graves (6 trench, 6 cist, 2 trenches with stone covers and one ossuary); Hel-Rom pottery was found. At the junction of Gortynios and A. Matzara (O.T. 210, Masoura plot) Hel sherds. At the anc. theatre, six exploratory trenches were opened and some restoration work was done. Trench VI/97 was the first opened on the upper level of seating of the theatre. Hel and Byz sherds and coins of 4th Ct BC- Rom times were noted. Section IX/97 revealed two small Byz graves. Generally, the view reached by earlier British excavators - that the original theatre was divided into nine tiers and ten stair- ways, each tier having 3-6 rows of seats - was confirmed. Professor Hans Lauter (DAI/Marburg) reports on work done in the 2002 season: 'In Megalopolis, excavations have been resumed since 1991 by the 5th EPCA, represented by Dr Anastasia Panayiotopoulou and Professor Lauter in a synergasia; (see H. Lauter, Antike Welt 33 (2002) 375-386). Work took place in August and September 2002 on the W side of the agora immediately S of the presumed demosia oikia. Here, a sanctuary of Zeus with an ground-level altar or an altar-platform constructed of limestone blocks was excavated in 2001 (see H. Lauter and Th. Spyropoulos, AA (1998) 415-451). This sanctuary proved in 2002 to be a near-square enclosure of 28-29m l.; with a peri- style courtyard at the centre. Of the peristyle only the euthyn- teria for the columns has survived. At least in the last phase of the sanctuary, the peristyle halls (3.25m d.) were accompanied by rows of adjacent rooms communicating either with the hall or with each other. The peristyle itself and the eschara date to soon after the foundation of Megalopolis, whilst the other exca- vated remains belong to the High and to the LHel restoration phases respectively. The names of two prominent Megalopolitans involved in the Hel (re-)building programme, Philopoimen and Polybios, the historian, were found on stamped tiles in the sanctuary. They read: Philopoimen Dii (Philopoimen for Zeus) and: Homilou. Damosioi/Polybios anetheke (of the workshop of Homilos, public roof-tiles/dedicated by Polybios). The name of Philopoimen is the one predominating among the more than 200 preserved, partly fragmentary, tile-stamps. Consequently Philopoimen may be regarded as the main dedicator of the sanc- tuary after the Spartan sack of 223 BC. The tiles bearing Polybios' name are associated with a further partial renovation, concerning only the second room from W on the N side. In the W sections of this chamber, a square deposit of larger pebbles formed the bottom of a hearth (fig. 45). From the NW corer of this structure starts a shallow libation-drain running obliquely to, and right along the N wall; it is made up of mortar and broken pot- sherds. Thus, given the ritual character of the hearth, and its proximity to the government's central build- ing, it may have been the common hearth (koine hes- tia) of the city. The modest rubble and mud-brick walks of the 'Polybian' room were decorated in the so-called First Pompeian style; fragments of imitated ashlar masonry in red and white stucco were found here. The excavators believe that the newly discov- ered sanctuary of Zeus is most likely that of Zeus Homarios mentioned by Polybios (5.93.10f.) which in this case would not be identical with the (homony- h mous) meeting-place of the Achaean League near Aigion, the Amarion (sic!) of Strabo (8.7.3,5).'

Cavanagh (BSA/Nottingham) and J. Renard (EFA/Clermont-Ferrand) report on the 2002 season: 'The second excavation season of the Kouphovouno Project took place between June and August 2002, and was confined to the plot of land (0.425 ha) purchased by the excavation on behalf of the Greek state. Five main areas (B and C, and the newly opened E, F, G) were worked (fig. 51). Area B lies close to the summit of the tell, 15m S of area C; the top of the plough soil is at about 199.0m asl. Last year, area B produced two EH/MH burials, in a cist (0108) and a pit (0105) grave respectively, and a number of stone platforms (0104, 0106 and 0107). Study of the pottery in spring 2002 indi- cated that most of the levels excavated below the plough soil appear to be of LNeo and Final Neo date. In 2002, area B was re-opened and a further extension to the W of 2.5m added, making the total extent of the exposed area approximately 5 x 7.5m. Stone platforms 0104/0119 and 0107/0120/0121 contin- ued into the extension; the latter, in the SW comer, was rough- ly oval in shape, though with some straight edges, and measured 2.6 x 2m, (the longer dimension continued into the S baulk). The stones were assembled in a shallow hollow (though the uppermost surface of the context into which the hollow had been cut could not be clearly distinguished), with the stones more densely concentrated along the central axis, and scattered less abundantly to the SW. At its maximum, the pile was 0.2m deep. Soil samples were taken for analysis. Stone platform 0104 was an irregular, sub-rectangular struc- ture, with stones pressed into the underlying fill, which pro- duced LNeo/Final Neo pottery. Two (plus another uncertain) broken quemstones were recovered from the stone pile, evi- dently thrown in with the main fill. Context 0106 was also a stone platform, similar in form and appearance to 0104. The pottery from all three of these stone platforms was similar in date: a very few sherds of EH II date in the uppermost part of their fills appear to derive from the layers above, but the main contexts date to LNeo/Final Neo. Last year, in the trials made into the levels stratified below the platforms, two small (-0.5m diameter) stone piles were discov- ered and tentatively identified as supports for a wooden framed building. The fill around them was rather soft to excavate and contained much charcoal and other organic matter. Below the fill were a number of features including a small apsidal arrange- ment (0133) and a feature in the centre of area B composed of clay fired bright orange (0127-0131); their significance is not yet clear, as are a number of other features with indications of burning, black soil, or fragments of burnt mud-brick. Area C, situated at the summit of the tell, between 199.45 and 199.40m asl, now covers 7.5 x 6m. We concentrated our efforts on the western two-thirds of the area. E part of area C. (a) We were able to demonstrate that the floor 0218 and the floor 0225, uncovered in 2001, were con- temporary (L MNeo) and had been cut by a circular pit (0280) which was possibly of Neo date and used as a grain store before being filled with large stones. The pottery scattered among the stones in the pit has been dated to EH. The bottom of the pit lies about 0.70m below the surface of the Neo floor and appears to stop on a new layer of the MNeo period. (b) The stone platform 0241 covered the fill of the pit at its N end and cut floor 0248. This stone platform, yielded L EHI - E EHII pottery. (c) The extent of the MNeo floor 0268 (= 0229 of 2001) could not be clearly established; it seems to disappear under stone platform 0241 to the E and further to the W, it extends into a sector occupied by features whose function is yet to be ascer- tained. North part of area C. (a) MNeo floor 0269 (= 0218 of 2001) extended further to the N and W. In the N it was covered by sig- nificant quantities of burnt mud-brick/pis6, indicating a fire of considerable intensity. Its N-E boundary was disturbed by later features. To the W it was cut by a hollow, within which a stone platform had been constructed (0245). The stone platform was firmly dated to EHII. (b) At the W end of the mass of vitrified clay, along the N baulk of the area, a circle of stones was probably the remains of a support for vases (0270). (c) In the NW comer of the excavation, there were remains of a collapsed structure arranged in an arc. Building clay, burnt red, rested on a concentration of small stones and sherds (0282) directly associated with floor 0269. W part of area C.

The skull, lying very close to the mod. ground level, had been disturbed, probably recently, and seemed excep- tionally large compared with the other bones. EH pottery was associated with this burial. A MNeo figurine was found in the surface soil, close to the grave (fig. 52). (b) Along the W wall of the trench a thick zone of burnt clay was found (0266), rich in plant remains and charcoal. Its bound- aries remain unclear; associated pottery suggests an EH date. S part of area C. (a) This area contained, scattered over an area of about 4m2 in the SW corer of the excavation, animal bones with butchery marks, shells, and stone tools. This assem- blage, which seems to lie on floor 0268, is associated with a clay vessel of medium size, found in situ among some stones, as well as a patch of burning and charcoal, its precise limits were masked by later deposits. It could represent an area for food preparation and cooking. (b) Along the S baulk, below the W end of platform 0241, floor 0268 seems to continue as a setting of flat stones, set horizontally, which continue beyond the limits of the area. Area E, a new sounding of 5 x 2.5m, 17m W of area C, on the W slope of the site, revealed, at a depth of 0.20m, a proba- bly Rom feature, possibly the fill of a ditch or stone rubble, con- taining pottery and tile fragments used as fill. A small trial trench 1 x 2m, and 1.2m deep, in the NW corer of the area, contained no PH remains. It indicates that the West side of the PH tell must have been steep, or that PH deposits were dis- turbed in the Rom period. Area F, measuring 2.5 x 5m was opened some 35m W of area B, in the SW sector of the plot. Surface survey had indicated Rom occupation further to the SWest, and L Rom levels were uncovered here. An alignment of hard-packed clay crossed the area from N-E-S-W (0503). Certainly considerably later than Rom, it could not be associated with any stone foundation or clay floor; its significance is not clear. Below it was a major L Rom destruction deposit, with tile, pottery and jumbled stone. Finds included a coin, glass, a square-headed Rom iron nail and LRom combed and grooved wares. This destruction deposit was exposed over the whole extent of area F, except two baulks. A trial at the W end of the area (box A) was dug to approximately 0.75m below ground level. Underneath the destruction deposits signs of pure Neo occupation levels were recovered. A small shell pendant was found within the earth contained by a small upturned MNeo carinated bowl. No EH material was discov- ered possibly because BA levels had been terraced away. Area G, 4.5m SW of area B, measured 5 x 2.5m and con- tained, at ca 0.3m below ground level, two small circular stone structures, close to the S baulk, and containing EH pottery; underneath were dark brown sediments, containing LNeo pot- tery. A first alignment of large stones, running E-W, appeared at the centre of the trench, but did not reveal any solid con- struction. A little lower, a second alignment of small stones (0626) was discovered along and underneath the E baulk. Most interesting is a solidly constructed curvilinear alignment of stones (0625) in the centre of the area. Oriented E-W, the curved section was found in the E of the area; the structure con- tinues into the W baulk. It is probably a wall, but in the absence of any associated floor it is uncertain whether it is a foundation, a socle or part of the superstructure. Excavation stopped at a level of brownish-green clay containing inclusions of charcoal and burnt mud-brick/pis6. The associated pottery is definitely LNeo, with sherds decorated in dark-on-light (matt-painted), and examples of polychrome pottery. Archaeobotanical Studies. 1100 litres of archaeological sed- iment from areas B, C, E, F and G have been processed by flota- tion machine (Fanny Moutarde), the sieve residue from the samples from areas B and C has been strewn and categorized: bone, seed, charcoal and shell. Samples range from 0.05 to 77 litres. Area C samples produced mostly seeds and bone, also some charcoal and shell. Area B was rich in bone, but poor in seed, charcoal and shell.

Most MNeo pottery comes from area C and is pre- dominantly of fine ware shapes, such as bowls and jars, with relatively few coarse sherds. Urfimis decoration in glossy black, dark brown or red paint is common. This can be mono- chrome or have simple linear motifs (fig. 53) or scribble burnish (randomly burnished lines which fire a darker colour, typically black on brown), characteristic of the later phases of the MNeo at other Peloponnesian sites). There is LNeo pottery, mainly L phase, from areas B and G, in particular fine and coarse vari- eties of black ware, usually burnished and occasionally deco- rated with white paint or incision. Grey ware is also present as is matt-painted pottery, typically with a white-slipped or white fabric, sometimes red or buff. Some sherds have polychrome or more rarely black on red decoration. Few clearly Final Neo contexts were excavated. From EH contexts in areas B and C we have EHI red-slipped and burnished pottery, typical EHII fine shapes and coarse ware vessels, often with finger-impressed cordons. Areas E and F produced some L H, A, C; and Hel sherds in mixed deposits. The large quantity of Rom tile versus a limited range of ceramics, mainly closed vessels, is characteristic of laconian rural sites and may indicate non-permanent occupa- tion. Dr Neil Brodie (Cambridge) and Dr Ian Whitbread (Leicester) are studying the MNeo to EHII pottery fabrics. (b) Terracotta. The fine MNeo female figurine noted above (fig. 52) from area C, parallels similar, but less well preserved, figurines from Corinth, Franchthi and Nemea. (c) Stone. Stone tools include axes, adzes and quers. Chipped stone artefacts are of obsidian and flint.</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 33 :(VND : 54 Geraki: early : \i fHelladic 'fruitstand' . .. f Amyklai. E.

Joost Crouwel and Mieke Prent (Netherlands Institute) report on the eighth season of archaeo- logical investigation by the University of Amsterdam: 'The 2002 campaign consisted of a study season, some on-site tests and cleaning in the context of a wall consolidation pro- gramme. (For preliminary reports, see Pharos, 1995-2001). Study concerned both PH and historical material. The great- est emphasis was placed on well-defined EH II contexts, espe- cially those associated with the room (2.2 x 3.6m) within the fortification wall in area II, partly excavated in 2000-2001; also with pottery recovered in the same area in the 2002 cleaning operation, including more pithoi (one with its lower part set in the floor), and many burnt sealings, several with impressions of lentoid seals, like those found earlier in this room and elsewhere at Geraki. A large 'fruitstand' (Inv. 1723/SF 1; surviving h. 31cm) with plastic decoration in local Geraki ware was found standing on the floor. It had a spout just above the floor of the basin, a feature so far unique for this shape (fig. 54), indicating that it served to hold liquids. The pottery from the casemate room appears to be homogeneous and belongs to the EH II late destruction horizon observed in different parts of the acropolis of Geraki. A detailed analysis was made of botanical remains in the pithoi and soil fill within the casemate room. They included a large charred supply of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.). The (Melian) obsidian and other chipped stone from the casemate room and elsewhere was also studied, leading to some conclu- sions on the position of PH Geraki in broader exchange net- works. The second major focus of attention was the study of the Cl and Hel to ERom pottery and their find contexts. Along with EH II, Cl-Hel pottery is prolific at the site. During these periods, the summit of the acropolis was re-fortified, and a number of size- able buildings erected. Portions of ten rooms or courtyards have been uncovered in area I and two or three in area II so far. These yielded evidence for domestic and industrial activities, such as metalworking. Work concentrated on the pottery from the upper levels, including assemblages of near-complete vessels. We are now able to date the final abandonment of these buildings with more certainty to within the later 1St Ct BC. Stratigraphic study shows that the abadonment was gradual and not marked by a violent destruction. The stamped and impressed tiles Hel-E Rom levels were also studied. Several of the stamped tiles, including five with the dokana motif symbolic of the Dioscouroi, appear to have been reused.' Gytheion. I. Efstathiou (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 196-7) notes that work on a car park by the public beach has revealed traces of Rom drains and LRom structures. Areopolis, Kalamakia cave. Co-operation between the EPS, the University of Athens and the Museum of Natural History of France was reported in Kathimerini (31/08/2002, 14). In 2002, MPal deposits, between 80,000 and 40,000 years old, were excavated. In the upper level (layer IV), the excava- tion was extended to squares D9, E9, C 10, D 10, E 10, C 11, D 11, El11. Two new habitation surfaces contained broken-up and burnt bone, stone tools and several pestles. The first level is characterized by an unusually large density of turtle remains (shells and skeletons). Mammal bones almost exclusively belong, as in the previous levels, to cervina and wild goat. Furthermore, a shell of the spondylus gaederopus type and a fragment of triton shell were found. The stone tools are charac- teristically Mousterian. In the lower level (top of layer III), excavation extended to squares D5, E5, D6, E6, D7, E7, D8, E8. Very few remains came probably indicate a layer representing very sporadic habi- tation of the cave. Here, bone remains belong mainly to wild goat and cervina; a Neanderthal tooth was also found.

In the left of the dromos, by the entrance, one burial with bronze sword, dagger and razor (and some beads) was found. In the chamber, three rectangular trenches had been cut into the floor; in one of which were the remains of three individuals, associated with a 'phi' figurine and a sealstone. In the E/NE part of the chamber were kraters, stirrup jars, alabastra of LH IIIA-C date, together with a bronze knife and eight spindle whorls.</page><page sequence="34">34 JAMES WHITLEY ..... t - inscriptions, one being the second inscription in Latin found at .. j''-'*--!-- , ii ~Messene (see also Ta Nea 21/11/2002).

Themelis, of the ASA, continued work here in several locations during 2001 and 2002 (Ergon 2001, 46-53; 2002, 27-35). It had been established that the theatre was first built in Hel times, and successively rebuilt and refurbished, first in the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, and then in the 2nd Ct AD. The proscenium was found to contain three niches, each containing two statues. In the E niche these were of Claudia Frontina and Tiberius Claudius Frontinus; in the central, of Tiberius Claudius Saithis Caelianus I and the emperor Trajan; and close to (but not in) the W niche, a statue of Lucius Verus, co-emperor with Marcus Aurelius (fig. 55). Other statues found in the vicinity include two herms (one representing Tiberius Claudius Saithis Caelianus I) and a statue of Isis Pelagia. S of the theatre a number of rooms were investigated. The W aisle and central area of the ECh basilica were investigated. An inscription to Isis indicates that the basilica was probably built over an earlier temple to Isis and Serapis (fig. 56). The basilica seems to have been re-used as a hostelry in the 10th and llth Ct AD. The major discovery of 2002 was of the sanctuary and Doric temple of Zeus Soter, mentioned by Pausanias, located SE of the spring of Arsinoe.

Sharon Stocker reports on study activ- ities of the ASCSA in 2002 on the 'Palace of Nestor': 'Valasia Isaakidou and Paul Halstead continued to examine animal bones from the Blegen excavations, while Sharon Stocker and Jack Davis studied the contexts (dates and character) of each deposit from which bones were retained. A paper dis- cussing six groups of burnt bones that apparently resulted from the sacrifice of cattle has been published in the journal Antiquity. Lynne Schepartz continued analysis of human skeletal material from chamber and tholos tombs associated with the Ano Englianos site. Elena Kontouri began a special study of LH IIIA pottery; Julie Hruby examined plain pottery from the palace pantries. Substantial progress was made by Hariclia Brekoulaki in reorganizing the storage of fresco fragments, re- examining programmes of painting in particular rooms of the palace, and joining additional fragments of plaster to those mended by Blegen. The nautilus frieze (4F nws in Palace of Nestor II) has been substantially expanded by Beatrice Amadei. Freya Evenson's re-examination of the so-called hunt- ing scene from room 27 suggests that it really is a scene of war- fare. A full examination of the technological aspects of Myc painting at the Palace of Nestor has begun: the availability of a portable XRF device in Hora allowed Andreas Karydas to determine the elemental composition of dozens of samples. We tentatively suggest that there was a hierarchy of pigments in the wall-paintings: certain paints appear to have been employed exclusively in the Throne Room. XRF has made it possible for the first time to distinguish between instances where plaster was actually painted and those where plaster has been discolored with stains of various types: there appears to be no evidence for pigments on fragment 19 C 6 from the Throne Room, which Lang reconstructed as a bull. Finally, many samples of wood from the Palace of Nestor will be C14-analysed by Peter Kunihom at Corell University.' 58 Elis: 4th Ct BC skyphoi ELEIA Prasino, Akones (P. Chronavaki plot). X.

Dorpfeld's interpretation was questioned because, the size and ground plan of building 7 dif- fer significantly from the BA apsidal houses. It turned out that</page><page sequence="36">36 JAMES WHITLEY 59 Olympia, building 7: apsidal foundation the 19th Ct excavations had gone below the level of the founda- tion of building 7, destroying the original floor and stratigraphy (fig. 59). However, the date of this structure could indirectly be determined, since immediately below the stones of the apsis there were remains of another building dated to the end of the 3rd millenium BC by means of pottery found in situ. Consequently, building 7 postdates the BA village. A M or LBA date can be ruled out, since no finds from between the end of the 3rd millenium BC and the 11th Ct BC are known in the altis. Thus, building 7 is most likely of EIA date. Kyrieleis pro- poses that this vast apsidal building, ca 7m wide, is, in fact, the oldest cult builing, i.e. the oldest temple of Zeus in Olympia. Of the postulated inner supports in the long axis of this struc- ture, so far a big post-hole with remains of carbonized wood has been found; a sample was taken for C14 dating. In November, the excavations were continued further NE. In February, Professor Aliki Moustaka (Thessalonike) con- ducted a small excavation at the altar of the Temple of Hera. It turned out that the altar was erected above the so-called 'black layer' containing, like other sections of the altis, small terra- cotta and bronze votives of the 8th Ct BC. In February, Professor Ulrich Sinn (Wiirzburg; leader of the research project 'Olympia in Roman Imperial times and Late Antiquity') documented the removal of the earthen layer below 0 5 60 Olympia: reconstruction of the Phillipeion the mosaic of the Rom building N of the Prytan- eion. Annegret Haseley continued her investigation of the development of the SW building. A large Ionic marble votive capital was recovered in the foundation of its N extension. Restoration work at the Temple of Zeus was con- tinued in spring and autumn. Frank, Beuthan and Kostas Zambas supervised the re-building of col- umn N 12. After the repair of anc. and modem dam- age to the lowest seven column drums, re-erection began in May. By December 2002 five of the for- mer 13 column drums had been put in their place. The partial reconstruction of the Philippeion, of which only the foundations survive, was authorized by the Kentriko Archaiologiko Symvoulio in August (fig. 60). It is planned to reconstruct one third of the stair foundation and three entire columns with archi- traves. Three further column stumps will clarify its overall appearance. The programme started in October under the supervision of Hajo van der Locht.

Moschos (ADelt, 292-3) reports on the excavation of six further chamber tombs (tombs 4-9) from the Myc cemetery, with finds mainly dating to LH IIIA-C. Tombs 5 and 6 had rock-cut trenches with interments of LH IIIC date, and a steatite sealstone in tomb 6. Tomb 9 had LH IIIA1 finds, including figurines. The richest was tomb 8, which contained alabaster vessels, a bronze shield boss, a bronze spearhead, parts of a boar's tusk helmet and a gold finger ring. Tomb 7 contained an LM IIIC stirrup jar and a Cypriot import, and some earlier (LH IIB) pottery from the dromos. Kato Achaia. G. Georgopoulou and A.

Georg Ladstatter (Austrian Institute) reports on archaeological investigations at Aigeira in 2002. X:: l ''In the Solon area, excavations in the public 'ban- queting house' concentrated on the S axis of the room (fig. 70). Apart from the bathing chamber with its bath- tubs (discovered earlier), a group of two rooms with clay floors to the N of the andron, and two further rooms of so far unknown function were excavated. A further flight of rooms to the S, only partially excavated, prob- ably had some service function, as is indicated by a heat- ing channel, covered with clay slabs, which enters the bathing room from the S and served the preparation of warm water, as well as by a shaft cistern. Subsequently, this complex was replaced with a com- pletely-preserved basin room. This room (2.50 x 1.80m) is covered in opus spicatum, has only one tub and two shallow basins of long rectangular and quarter-circular shape. Presumably, the bathing room with the four tubs was abandoned intentionally and replaced with its smaller successor. The use of the public 'banqueting house', built in the mid-4th Ct BC, is indicated by a deposit of pottery sherds and lamps, partially excavated to the W outside the building. This ensemble of amphoras, kraters, kantharoi, bowls and plates dates to the first third of the 3rd Ct BC and represents a sample of table wares. Considerable rearrangements probably took place in the course of the 3rd Ct; the replacement of a large bathing room with a r smaller one suggests that the originally public building became a private dwelling. On the floor of the smaller basin room, a local imitation of a ESAAtlante form 3 type plate was found, indicating that the room, and presumably the whole building, were abandoned in the 1st Ct BC. Of the 'W building', separated from the 'banqueting house' by a street, and so far only touched upon, the NE comer and a wall crossing in the S, traversed by a drainage channel, were located. Function and chronology are still unclear, but the rectangular plan and its relation with the 'banqueting house' suggest a gridded building scheme on the Solon-terrace. First examinations of the fortification of the Hel lower town took place. From general observation of the terrain, and 17 informative stretches of wall, its course is largely clear. The for- tification, has no towers and encloses an area of about 50 hectares within its length of about 3 km. As far as visible, the superstructure is a double-faced wall, 2.10m w., its faces are four pseudo-isodomic courses of blocks, originally supporting a mud-brick superstructure. This Hel technique is markedly dif- ferent from the Ar-Cl fortification of the upper town with its wall socle off pseudo-polygonally cut blocks. Geological study regarding the settlement and topographical development of Aigeira indicates for the Hel lower town, that on the one hand large areas sit on unstable marl, but also that an extensive conglomerate outcrop (Scholle) extends from the acropolis across the theatre complex N to the area called 40 hl-</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 41 Koupina. This geologically stable area is identical with the more densely built-up area of Hel Aigeira. Probably, the Ar-Cl upper town, with the acropolis as its cultic centre had been deliberately abandoned and replaced by the extensive Hel lower town. In the context of the post-excavation program for Wilhelm Alzinger's work on the acropolis, the E foundation of building B was cleaned. The L-shaped foundation, surviving in only one course, contains small conglomerate lumps, partially represent- ing reused material from Myc architecture. In the S leg, three reused fragmented conglomerate slabs lie on those lumps, indi- cating later modification of the structure. The N/S oriented wall is joined by an EW running foundation that may belong to the same building. Differences in measurements and technique, as well as the absence of an axial relationship indicate that the E and W foun- dations cannot belong to the same building. The W foundation probably represents the remains of a LAr temple in antae. The bad preservation of the E precludes further interpretation.' EPARCHIA OF AIPALEIAS Elaionas, Agioi Asomatoi/Marathias.

Ergon 2001, 56-9 and Eleutherotypia (14/10/2002) provide more details on the 2001 synergasia. Work concentrated on the exedra first identified by Mastrokostas, now thought to belong to a bouleuterion rather than a theatre. S. Dietz (Danish Institute) and I. Moschos (6th EPCA) report on the 2002 season: 'In June and July, the Danish Institute, in collaboration with the Archaeological Society, carried out the second campaign in anc. Kalydon, Aitolias. Work on a full plan of the remains, a small survey, geophysical and geological studies of the site and the anc. coastlines continued in 2002. Geomagnetic survey was conducted in the entire area, (approx. 4 ha), inside the W gate. The 1920s/30s excavations suggested that a sacred road connected this gate with the sanc- tuary of Artemis Lauria. Our measurements indicated a pattern of streets and buildings in the triangular area. A road passed along the fortification wall connecting the W gate with the NW gate; further streets passed from the area around the W gate upwards towards the acropolis on the N mound. One street went from a small gate in the fortification wall, while minor streets ran at right angles from the main streets and parallel to the walls, dividing the rising ground into horizontal terraces. Foundations for substantial buildings were located beside the streets; multiple cisterns and fireplaces were located in this part of the anc. town. Industrial activities had taken place in the area. In contrast to the lower part of the town, where roads were oriented according to the sloping ground, the geomagnetics indicate the existence of an orthogonal street system in the cen- tral, probably the main residential part, of the town. On the acropolis, according to the survey, substantial foundations crossing at right angles lie slightly below the surface; some are visible. Excavations on the uppermost acropolis terrace resulted in a better understanding of the plan and stratigraphic situation. Here, a number of 10xO1m soundings, covering 400-500m2, were opened. On the very top of the mound, over 160m asl, a Rom villa, probably covering around 400m2, was built on top of Hel walls. Some of the rooms had mosaics and spolia from ear- lier buildings were reused as doorsteps. Further S of the Hel constructions, the excavations revealed Ar and Cl strata with foundation walls, terracottas, a few bronze figurines and paint- ed roof tiles. Earlier walls diverged slightly in orientation from later ones. Towards the S borders of the plateau, three large pithoi were found inside a well-preserved Ar stone wall. On the S slope of the sanctuary of Artemis Lauria, excava- tions continued in the so-called Bouleuterion (fig. 71) Additional rows of seats were exposed. The structure is rather well-preserved at its axis, while seats in the wings have been removed. As shown in 2001, the lower row of seats in the E direction terminated approximately 16m from the central axis, where the stone blocks continued in a right angle 10m south- wards, where a parodos was situated. In the 2002 campaign this area was excavated and a vast amount of tiles and terracottas of Hel date was found. Further S a row of well-dressed stone slabs indicated that a building had existed in the place where a proskenion would be expected in a theatre. The function of the whole ensemble has not yet been established.' Environs of Kalydon. M.

Plagia-peninsula (Akamania). A Greek-German survey took place under the directorship of Dr Lazaros Kolonas (General Director of Antiquities, Hellenic Ministry of Culture) in co- operation with Prof. Dr Erst-Ludwig Schwandner (DAI, Berlin), Prof. Peter Funke (Miinster) and Dr Franziska Lang (Humboldt-University, Berlin). It aimed to complete the sec- tion along the bay of Palairos and to explore the S and W Plagia-peninsula. An area of 15.3km2 was covered in September and October 2002. The finds show occupation phases from all periods (MPal to 19th Ct AD). A huge number of Pal stone artefacts was found on the surface and in caves. MH artefacts were found in several areas, including E of the anc. town of Palaeros. Several watch/guard-houses near the coast are Cl and Hel in date, for example, near the Venetian castle of Agios Georgios, among other structures, there is the Cl fortress Kastro Lithies and, on a rock-ledge beside the sea, a partially looted Hel tile- grave. Remains of the Byz period were found, among other places, on the hill of Palaeochori where traces of an Ot settle- ment were also observed. The remnants of a Hel watch-tower are still visible on top of the hill, whilst those of a MByz church were detected N of Palaeochori. KEPHALLENIA AND ITHAKA Kephallenia A.

Kokkolata-Mylones. Dr Christina Souyoutzoglou-Haywood (Irish Institute) reports on fieldwork carried out in 2001-02 in collaboration with the 6th EPCA (Andreas Soteriou): 'The triangular plateau, the first prominence at the S edge of the Argostoli plain, had produced PH, Geo, Rom and Byz sherds in the 1980s. Systematic survey and trial cuttings pro- duced handmade and wheelmade domestic pottery, mainly amphoras and jugs, tiles, some glass, a millstone and olive press. Fragments of walls (probably LByz or Med), in parts making use of the natural rock, were preserved along the NE and S sides. Some sections of the walls were unusual in con- struction, being composed of large orthostats. In two places, the walls formed purposely-built entrance-like openings. Remains of a fossilized skeleton were excavated at the base of one of the S walls. It is suggested that the site became a defensible farm- stead in the LByz-Med period and was subsequently terraced for the cultivation of raisins during the Venetian occupation. The pottery requires further study and much remains, for the time being, without local comparanda (Classics Ireland 10 (2003) 64-73).' Ithaka Dr C. Morgan (King's College London) and Dr A. Soteriou (6th EPCA) report on work on the Stavros Valley survey undertak- en jointly by the BSA and the Ephoreia in 2002: 'The survey covered an area of 4.5km2 between the village of Stavros and the coast, encompassing the Polis valley (exten- sively explored by Benton), the neighbouring Ag. Ioannis promontory and the Roussano valley to the N (both hitherto</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 43 unexplored). Work was conducted in April and August/ September. Geophysical survey was conducted by Dr Boyd (Fitch Laboratory, BSA). Sites previously reported by Benton and/or the 6th EPCA. In addition to the previously published sites of Tris Langades and the Stavros cemetery, the following sites were relocated and reappraised: Kamini. A Late Cl-Hel kiln chamber at the SE end of Polis Bay. Despite extensive damage from agricultural use, the out- line of the chamber was clearly visible. The chamber wall was well preserved only in the apse; elsewhere, blocks were inter- spersed with a dense packing of tile and tile wasters. Benton's (unrecorded) trench was located, and some of her material dis- covered in the Stavros apotheke. In addition to the recorded amphoras, it includes tile wasters and other architectural mem- bers (including a late Cl/EHel sima of W Greek style) indicat- ing that the kiln was first used during the construction of an unknown monumental public building. A large quantity of Hel-Rom amphora sherds, of various dates and types, were found in the chamber, but study to date reveals little evidence for amphora manufacture. Resistivity and magnetometry were conducted in the area, revealing a significant magnetic anom- aly, perhaps a further, more deeply buried, chamber. Three grave cuttings in the Rom cemetery beside the Stavros-Polis road were recorded. They included two re-used architrave blocks from a monumental public building, recut for use in a secondary monumental structure (perhaps a funerary peribolos), which involved cutting to accommodate a statue or stele. There are undisturbed deposits around these blocks, and in view of evidence from Kamini, the chronology of reuse is of great interest. No further anc. worked blocks were discovered; similar blocks reported on the opposite side of the valley proved to be modem cuttings. No evidence for local quarrying has been discovered. The Med churches of Agia Sophia and Agios Andreas were recorded for publication by Rigakou. There was no evidence of further construction in the vicinity. Geophysical survey was conducted around Agios Andreas. A tower on the Roussano acropolis had been excavated by both Vollgraff and Benton. Benton's pottery relocated and cata- logued in the Stavros Museum comprises 16 sherds from 15 vessels, MHel-Rom. Neither the tower nor the surrounding double circuit wall have been formally published. There are quarried outcrops nearby. Benton reported an extensive but not very dense scatter of Hel-Rom tile, waterpipe and amphora fragments in the Kouvaras vineyard at Asprosykia, but a small-scale excavation here pro- duced virtually no finds. Intensive fieldwalking produced no evi- dence of a site, but did locate a monumental construction of field stones which strongly resembles the entrance to the small foun- tain at Agios Athanasios. Geophysical survey indicates (prelimi- narily) the presence of a cross-wall extending back across the modem terrace wall, partially utilising anc. masonry, and con- necting with a further stretch of similar masonry ca 10m back. This could be the spring briefly reported by Benton 'Geometric house'. In 1935, Benton located two graves (Geo and Rom) close to the second bend in the Stavros-Polis road; a supposed house nearby was excavated in 1937. Only the contents of the Rom grave have been traced. The site was located and the supposed rear and side walls of the house recorded; it bears close similarity to a better preserved structure recorded by the survey W of Asprosykia (which consists of a curved rear wall of a structure set on a low terrace). Finds were few and predominantly E mod. with a little Hel/Rom tile. By contrast, the Asprosykia structure was surrounded by a dense concentration of Hel? tile. Intensivefieldwalking aimed to assess Benton's observations against modem standards of site definition, to widen geograph- ical coverage from the previous focus on the Polis valley, and to understand the relationship between landscape evolution, arte- fact transport and diachronic settlement strategies. Only in one case on the Agios Ioannis peninsula were the combined effects of coastline change and modem construction and dumping such as to preclude systematic sampling. The widening of the Stavros-Polis road in April provided an opportunity to examine a series of fresh areas; these produced the first of a total of five EH locations discovered by the SVS. Sherd density maps are being prepared (Papaioannou/Morgan), with preliminary phasing based on a first reading of the ceramics (Morgan, Soteriou, Paschalidis), indicating peaks of activity in Hel/Rom and LRom/EMed, with extensive activity over the entire area; by contrast, Ar and EC1 activity is largely confined to the sad- dle of modem Stavros. The Roussano valley produced few finds as early as Hel, with the majority Rom-Ven. A large Hel-M scatter on the low- est terrace seems to have its origin on the acropolis. On the upper terraces, below the adjacent acropolis, a series of con- centrations of large and well-preserved sections of rooftile seems to represent destruction layers of one or more structures cut by modem terracing. Geophysical investigation of the largest of these areas, where traces of a cross wall were visible on the surface, indicated an angle of a wall consistent with a building. A particularly striking feature of the survey area is the volume and fine preservation of E mod. evidence (terracing, spitakia etc.). Geophysics (Boyd). In addition to survey at the sites noted above (Kamini, Asprosykia, Agios Andreas and Roussano), the location of a particularly well-defined and dense concentration of Rom sherds at a low elevation in the upper valley was sur- veyed, showing no signs of constructions, and a 5 x 100m tran- sect across Polis Bay was surveyed to provide comparative data the geomorphological team. Geomorphology (Wainwright, Charlton). Work focused on evaluation of the extent and nature of slope erosion around the Stavros Valley and the pace and nature of change in water- courses. Little evidence was found of significant long-term slope erosion in any area. Limited evidence of long-term changes of stream courses in the N part of the valley may shed light on the location of the putative spring at Asprosykia and the location of mostly H/Rom remains found in this wider area. A fossilized stream bed was located close to EH remains in the Stavros-Polis road cut. A large system of berms in the coastal zone of the valley bottom, no longer maintained, probably reflects an irrigation system introduced around field boundaries under British rule. In September, a further 26 auger samples were collected in the base of Polis Valley. A number of samples contain charcoal and there is evidence of a changing valley-floor environment down-core in a number of places. Frequent occurrences of charcoal and archaeological materials within these samples enable a good chronology for the valley-floor evolution. To evaluate soil types and land productivity spatially, 57 surface samples were taken, from which a provisional soil- property map is now being generated. Finally, analysis is under- way of aerial and historical photographs to evaluate land-use changes in the valley over the last century. Palaeotography of the Polis Cave (Hayward). Close study of the site itself and the geology of the area was necessary to place Benton's archaeological interpretations in a valid physical con- text. Geological survey identified the main features and charac- teristics of the area of the site (on the beach and on the hillside to the S and West). The first accurate state plan of the site was made.</page><page sequence="44">44 JAMES WHITLEY It seems unlikely that any major cave-like structure could have existed at the site of the Polis 'cave'. The key objection stems from its proximity to the substantial fault that runs through the site. The Tertiary carbonates immediately to the N of the fault are not suitable for the support of metre-sized speleothems in the area envisaged by Benton to have contained the 'cave'. The Mesozoic carbonates which form the cliff immediately adjacent to the S of the fault do contain speleothems in large numbers, but these are at most 30-40cm across, and damage to the rock through faulting makes the pres- ence of larger speleothems in these rocks extremely unlikely.

In addition to the work on pottery from Roussano (completed) and Kamini (continuing) noted above, progress has been made as follows: (a) Cataloguing of unpublished, and reappraisal of pub- lished, finds from graves around modem Stavros is largely complete. Reappraisal of the pottery published by Waterhouse in BSA 47 reveals more extensive local production, plus Peloponnesian, NW Greek and S Italian imports, than initially assumed. Unpublished graves include three from a hitherto unreported location close to the road to Kioni; this would imply the existence either of a previously unknown north cemetery or a considerable extension of the known area of the NW ceme- tery. A small amount of jewellery from these graves. (b) In addition to postBA pottery from levels between graves at the S end of Stavros village (which is much more plentiful than implied in BSA 47), a very large collection of local black glaze, plainwares and storage vessels (mostly Cl-Hel with some Ar) comes from two or three deep trenches opened by Benton in the Plateia. There is no reference to this excavation in print or in Benton's notebooks; however, codes marked on these sherds, which plainly do not relate to other excavations, corre- late with a loose sketch plan. These two collections of sherds represent large-scale settlement activity on the saddle of mod. Stavros, immediately above our survey area, the halo from which was conspicuos during the survey. Agios Athanasios. Morgan is revising for publication a draft manuscript by the late John Cook on pottery from the 1930 and 1937 BSA excavations at Agios Athanasios (all post-PH and almost entirely late 4th Ct BC-3rd Ct AD). The finds indicate a much more extensive deposit, especially of plainwares, amphoras and black glaze, than Cook implied. There is exten- sive evidence for local production (including an unusual collec- tion of West Slope ware) combined with an eclectic range of imports especially from Asia Minor and Italy. Grey wares (23 sherds), figurines (ca 6), Megarian and other relief bowls (ca 160 pieces), have been catalogued. Work on black glaze is in progress (61 pieces to date), and cooking wares, lamps, red slip and most West Slope remain to be done. About 30 coins report- ed have not yet been located.' BOIOTIA Thebes. A. Aravantinos, of the 9th EPCA, (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 353-64) reports on excavations in three locations: at the Archaeological Museum site, an EH complex was excavated, the earliest phase of which was an apsidal house and associated stone platforms; its standard of construction equals that of the Myc palatial period. A later phase is represented by the deposi- tion of 12 adult skeletons in a stratum overlying the apsidal house with finds dating to the very end of EH II (Lefkandi I). The funerary complex of which this was a part seems to be a tumulus, bounded by an impressive stone wall. Four MH cist burials were also found nearby. On the Kadmeia, further investigations were made in the Myc 'room of the treasury'. The upper strata included Byz lev- els, an LRom/EByz bath complex (including parts of a mosaic floor), and an LMyc/EGeo stratum containing an EGeo male figurine. At the very top of the Myc destruction horizon was a Myc sealing with an image of a quadruped. The horizon itself contained much carbonized wood which seems to have fallen from an upper floor. On the floor below was a gold disc (fig. 72). In the substratum beneath the floor was a circular pit containing pots, tiles and fragments of wall paintings depicting a papyrus, all of which seem to have come from an earlier phase of the palace complex, of which the 'room of the treasury' was a part. The destruction horizon seems to date to LH IIIB. At the spring of Dirke and the 'cave of the Serpent', nothing (apart from re-used BA blocks) earlier than the Turkish period was found. E. Kountouri (ADelt, 364-70) reports on rescue excavations elswhere in the city: Between the Basiakou bridge and the Panayaina well, just E of the Moschopodio stream, two LCl pyres, and four tile and 18 adult cist graves of Hel/ERom date were found. Associated finds include perfume flasks, three gold danakes (coins) with central gorgoneia, and a fragment of a funerary stele in the form of a naiskos with Ionic pilasters. At the Farmers' Union (Enosi Georgikon Synetairismon), two LRom walls and a LCl/EHel pit were found. At the railway station a large Hel rectangular structure with three rooms was investigated. In a pot inside one of the rooms was a hoard containing eight silver and 449 bronze coins (dating to between 288 and 146 BC) and numerous pieces of gold jewellery, including a clasp, necklace, gold beads and four gold plaques (fig. 73). At the junction of Pelopidou and Tseva (Chouchoumi-Sinni plot, O.T. 379), a LByz structure overlies an earlier Rom one. Beneath was a robbed LHel cist grave, containing a gold earring and three female figurines, which had in turn disturbed an MH child's grave. At Pyri (junction of Kleitarchou and N. Parodos of Agiou Athanasiou), a LByz wall. At Kolonaki (O. Lymberiou) eight Byz graves (2 tile, 4 trench, 1 built chamber and 1 reused Myc chamber tomb). At O. Herakleous, a (Cl-Rom) clay water pipe. At the junction of Agiou Konstantinou and Smyrnis, a rectangular LHel structure with a painted floor with an image of a flute player. Both Ta Nea (6/8/2002, 25) and Apogevmatini tis Kyriakis (16/2/2003, 74) report on discoveries by the 9th EPCA in the area close to the railway line and the bridge linking Thebes to the national road. Over 1200 Geo-Rom burials have now been found in this area. Recent finds include an Ar marble kouros head dating to ca 510 BC and a LAr inscription on a marble kioniskos. The inscription, whose letter forms and content date it to precisely 506 BC, provides a unique Theban perspective on the war between Athens on the one hand and Thebes and Chalkis on the other, as described by Herodotos (V.74-81). Rescue excavations by the 1st EBA on O. Ep. Giannakou 10 (O.T. 203, G. and M. Katseli plot) uncovered a Byz bath house, the first of this period found here (ADelt 115). The site is close to the so-called Spring of Ares (Lagoumi, Pege); 10th-13th Ct AD sherds help date the structure. Other small- scale investigations in the area are reported (ADelt 121-3). Structural remains on the Tambouri Rouki site (O.T. 570, K. and A. Stamidis site) were identified with a water-mill (7.20 x 3.80m). Coin treasures were found from the 2nd half of the 11th Ct AD. Evidence here indicates that the 'Roman' mill type known from 5th Ct AD sites was used during later periods (ADelt 116-18).</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 45 74 Tanagra, Kokkali: Classical/Hellenistic figurines E.

Charami (ADelt, 371-5 and 376-7) notes finds in three locations: at Kokkali, some Cl pyres and 27 Hel graves (12 cist, 4 trench, 7 tile) and a funerary peribolos were found. Sparse finds include over 20 female figurines (fig. 74) and some West Slope ware. Other structures were located in the vicinity, including a Byz structure associated with the church of Agios Polykarpos. At Dendro and Bali, nine Ar graves (4 trench, 2 tile, 2 inter- ments in vessels and 1 larnax) and nine Ar pyres were found. Finds include aryballoi and figurines of horses, with and with- out riders. Nearby were LRom finds (clay drainpipe, coins and lamp) and a re-used Hel grave stele, with the inscription: AIHOAAOAOTA / DIAAIIIOE / AAMATPA. At the 'biological cleaning site', finds from eleven robbed Hel graves (9 cist, 2 tile) included lamps and some West Slope ware. Prof. J. Bintliff (Netherlands Institute/Leiden) and Prof. Bozidar Slapsack (Ljubljana) report on the results of the 2002 survey season of the Leiden/Ljubljana Tanagra project: 'In summer 2002 we carried out surface survey across the city of Tanagra in Boeotia and in the immediately surrounding countryside or chora, continuing work begun in 2000. The last third of the interior of the Cl city walls was subjected to ceram- ic survey by the Leiden team. The micro-topographic survey of the intramural area and the recording of surface architectural remains, together with the detailed geoprospection mapping (Ljubljana) continued. The study of the sample of surface pot- tery was also continued further by PH specialist K. Sarri, Cl Greek ceramic specialist Dr V. Stissi, Rom pottery specialist Dr J. Poblome and our Med to Post-Med specialist A. Vionis. The geoprospection team continued to have spectacular success in picking out the 4th Ct BC Hippodamian street and insula plan across the city, together with major modifications to the internal house arrangements within the original insulae during Rom times, and also to identify a large area of industrial production - possibly a Med ceramic production zone within the aban- doned anc. town.

Tanagra, by the Leiden team, was focused on a transect running S from the walls, an area so far untouched. As in the transects walked in 2000 and 2001, this new S tran- sect identified a zone some lkm long out from the walls with extremely dense surface pottery, primarily of Cl date, which we interpret as an area of cemeteries, extramural industry and some extramural settlement. Further out we entered an area of small C1 farms and related cemeteries, a large Rom villa, and a series of small Neo sites, as well as a small deserted Med village.' Kallithea Tanagras (Moutsophades). On the E slope of Mt Soros or Teumessos, P. Stamatakis (Ergon 2002, 40-2) of the ASA reports on investigations near the church of Agia Triada. Excavations revealed sherds of Cl to Byz date and a rectangu- lar structure associated with numerous figurines and pottery of the 4th Ct BC, which epigraphy (IG VII. 560-2) suggests was a shrine of Cybele. A relief showing the nocturnal worship of Cybele, and dating to 420 BC was removed to the National Museum. Asopia-Kleidi. A. Choremi (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 375-6) notes eleven Cl graves (7 tile, 2 cist and 2 destroyed) and four Cl pyres. Finds include figurines, red figure and black glaze pottery. At Kleidi an anc. quarry was noted. Akraiphnion. E. Vlachogianni (ADelt, 377-392) reports on the extensive rescue excavations that have taken place as a result of the widening of the national road between Athens and Lamia. Finds come from three principal areas: At the Mavrodemou plot, an ERom house dating to the Julio-Claudian period was uncovered. On the north side of the national road, numerous burials and pyres (48 adult, 26 children) of protoGeo to Rom date (1 protoGeo, 4 LGeo, 4 Ar, 9 C1 pyres, 28 Hel, 10+ Rom and 18 not closely datable) (fig. 75). Types of burials include cist, trench, tile and children's interments in amphoras. Important graves include the protoGeo pyre, two rich Ar trench graves, one of an adult man ('warrior grave') interred with 27 vessels, an iron knife and sword, the other of an adult woman with bronze jewellery, fibulae and belt, and another Ar interment with bronze armlets. Cl finds include a funerary inscription, and West Slope ware was found in many Hel graves. Among the Rom graves was a funerary structure containing three loculi, numerous interments, finds dating from the 4th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct AD and an inscription (EHI HIAN4)IAQ HPQ[I]) in letters of 1st Ct AD (with a relief of a horseman) which seems to identify it as a her6on (fig. 76). Most of the other structures in the area seem to date to Rom times: one circular structure, possibly a workshop, one rectangular kiln. Also a LRom structure with loomweights and other finds indicating workshop activity, cov- ered by a destruction horizon full of tiles and other material that can date it precisely to 324-361 AD. There is also evidence for a structure, possibly a dam, associated with a Byz cistern and drain, which can be dated to the 11th Ct AD. On the south side of the national road, burials were sparser (1 undated, 1 Hel tile grave and 3 Rom graves). Other finds include house remains, with both Geo and Cl associated pottery and Athenian coins of 330-317 BC; another structure with an LC1 and LRom phase; and LC1 house remains. The principal find was a C1 structure with rooms, possibly a workshop for fig- urines or coroplasty to judge from the finds. Inside was an apo- thetis full of Cl black glaze and red figure pottery, figurines dat- able to ca 450 BC and evidence of sophisticated coroplasty in the form of terracotta hands (fig. 77). Rescue excavations by the 1st EBA (ADelt 123-28; see ADelt 1996, 84-5) yielded 200 4th Ct AD coins from a settle- ment site, along with an intact LRom lamp in the destruction level; a mid-5th Ct AD reconstruction date is attested, and 4th Ct AD kilns indicate industrial use of uncertain nature. Significant remains of a small triconch church of Agios Basileios (10th-1 th Ct AD with later narthex) were uncovered, along with burials. Marble templon fragments are recorded. Coin finds date from the 6th Ct AD to a hyperpyron of John III Vatatzes (1222-54).</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 47 Kopaida, Sarakino cave. Levels dating from the Upper Pal (30,000 -25,000 BP) to the EH have been recorded from this cave. The principal levels are Late to Final Neo (c 4300 BC).

In all twenty graves (14 adults, 6 children) of known types (12 tile, 5 trench, 2 pyres and one enchytrismos), contain- ing black glaze pottery such as lekythoi and alabastra, as well as figurines and lamps, were dug. At the Xanemo Palaiochoras (Gilipathi plot), eight LCl-EHel graves (2 trench, 3 tile, 2 cist and one enchytrismos) were found. Finds include black glaze pottery, bronze coins and lamps. At Kastri (anc. Geraistos, Keleri-Papamastroyianni plot), one Hel enchytrismos and some Hel-Rom sherds were found. Karystos Survey.

Aliveri (AES site). A. Chatzidimitriou (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 405-7) reports on the continuing excavations of the LRom-ECh bath complex, which can be confidently dated from finds of pottery, clay lamps, glass perfume flasks and coins, to the 4th to 6th Cts AD. Close to the S side, near the entrance, is a mosaic floor; nearby, in the frigidarium, two water troughs were found. The caldarium consists of two halls, the first with a hypocaust floor; three smaller rooms were investigated. The com- plex does not seem to have been used after the early 7th Ct AD. Zarakes Karystias (Zoodochou Pigis). A. Chatzidimitriou (ADelt, 407-9) reports on excavations of six structures of LGeo to LRom date, 3km S of the village. Structure I has both a LC1 and a LRom date; structure II is LGeo, with a stone wall and internal post-holes. Finds include a relief pithos of the mid 7th Ct BC, with a depiction of a centaur and an early inscription. Structure III is Cl in date, and structure IV has both LGeo and LC1 phases. Finds here included black glaze pottery, with the letters IE inscribed on their base, and a (LCl?) bronze stamp, with an image of a ram's head and the inscription AIOA- AQNOX AHAIO. More inscribed sherds ofLGeo, Ar and Cl date were also found. Structures V and VI seem to be LRom farm buildings, as testified by finds of mortars etc. Dystos (Kastri Dyston). A. Chatzidimitriou (ADelt, 409-10) notes the discovery of a tunnel connected to the Med kastro here. Oreoi. S. Katakis (ADelt, 410-13) reports on finds in two loca- tions. At the Katsoula plot (O.T. 11) a LCl-Hel road divides two other structures. The road has two phases; the first dated by a coin of Tenedos (5th-4th Ct BC) to the 4th Ct BC, the second by other coins (of Istaia, from 338-end 3rd Ct BC, Antigonos Gonatas and Ptolemy 1st) to EHel times. Excavations at the Michelakou plot (O.T. 12) revealed two circular kilns and walls of Hel date forming part of a potter's workshop. The structures have two phases, the second being contemporary with the so- called 'hoard of Opeoi' (97 BC). Loutra Aidipsou. S. Katakis, A. Ritsonis and V. Nikolopoulos (ADelt, 413-6) report on finds in four locations. At the Trigga plot (O.T. 21) Rom walls (2nd Ct AD); at the Langourani plot (O.T. 106), five Rom (?) graves (2 tile, 2 cist and 1 trench). The most significant find is from Koubi (Tsalaki-Lilli plot), where Myc house remains were excavated. Remains of the first LH I phase were sparse, but contained at least one pot that resembles matt painted ware (fig. 79). Two structures could be associated with the later, LH II/IIIA phase. The N structure had a destruction horizon with traces of fire. Beneath it were two children's graves of either EH or MH date. The E structure con- tained pithoi. Most associated pottery was plain, apart from some LH II sherds with depictions of Myc 'figure of eight' shields. Other finds include bronzes and two 'phi' figurines. There are also LH finds from the nearby Glybi plot. Skyros. A. Koronakis, of the 11th EPCA (ADelt, 416) reports on finds in two locations: at Kolona, an inscribed Rom funerary stele; at Krokos a marble fragment, possibly of a kouros. 79 Loutra Aidipsou: late Helladic matt-painted vessel PHTHIOTIS AND EAST LOKRIS Lamia. Ph. Dakoronia, A. Stamoudi and P.

Isaia 18 (Miga plot): below Byz levels, remains of an LC1 house with pottery of the 4th and 3rd Ct BC. Megarian bowls and W slope ware can be assigned to the later EHel phase. In the N area, numerous unpainted and unfinished ves- sels were recovered, suggesting that this may have formed part of a workshop. O. Anthilis (Miga plot): four EHel graves (1 sarcophagus, 2 cist, 1 tile) contained black glaze pottery of the very end of the 4th to the 3rd Ct BC, and one Howland type 30B lamp. In the levels above, the first grave stele (Hel) to be found in Lamia, datable to the 3rd-2nd Ct BC bore the following inscription: IOAEMAPXOZ, HOAYZTPATOX, AIZXPA. O. Palaiologou 19 (Koutla plot): Hel house walls with pot- tery of 3rd-2nd Ct BC including West Slope ware. A cist grave is of a type which may be subMyc or protoGeo, but had no finds. O. Othonos 39 (Skylari plot): part of city wall, and some LH IIIC sherds. 0. Poseidonos 14 (Lianou plot): three EHel trench graves; pottery of the 3rd Ct BC included an amphora of 'Macedonian' type.

Dakoronia reports (ADelt, 437-41) the discovery of a succession of houses at Melidoni (Agia Aikaterini) dating from the C1 to EByz period. The end of the first phase (Sth-Ct) is marked by a destruction horizon. The later external wall dates to the 4th Ct BC. The next (ERom) occupa- tion phase dates to the 1st Ct AD, and the final LRom-EByz phase to the 5th and 6th Cts AD. Re-used funerary stelai and inscriptions were found associated with these phases. Nearby, to the S of the new national road, and NE of the wall of the anc. city, an extensive LCl-Hel cemetery was excavated. The 27 tombs (17 tile, 3 trench, 3 funerary pithoi and 4 enchytrismoi) were rich in finds of Hel black glaze pottery and bronzes (coins, fibulae, rings and pins). Stylida. Ph. Dakoronia and P.

Activities in 2002 are reported by J.- F. Bommelaer (French School): 'The work started on the theatre in 1999, at the request of the 10th EPCA, continued. In 2002, it had two elements: Gilbert Latzarus (French School) and I finished the task of cataloguing the scattered blocks; 196 blocks are currently listed, without counting 45 blocks of dubious origin. We also studied the walls 82 Kampos Doridas: 4th Ct BC grave stele of the parodoi and the walls of the ramp, and improved existing diagrams of the elevation of the theatre. In the S sector of the sanctuary of Apollo, in preparation for a topographical and architectural publication to appear in Fouilles de Delphes, we reviewed a total of over 200 diagram- matic and pictorial documents, by about 20 scholars, in posses- sion of the School, plus drawings from Strasbourg.' Cataloguing the blocks on the S of the Siphnean Terrace and on the Theban Terrace. Dominique Mulliez reports: 'The aim of this study, started originally by Pierre Amandry, is to arrange some terraces for the ordering of 'errant' blocks and inscriptions. The 10th EPCA has started to construct a porch in PI, on an upper level of Apollo's sanctuary, for this purpose. In the summer of 2002 we began to undertake the cataloguing of those blocks which are currently distributed randomly, to establish a series of categories, and finally to build terraces upon which to place them; 156 blocks have been studied so far.'

At Agioi Anargyroi/O. Kolokotroni (Andrikopoulou plot): P. Triandaphyllopoulou of the 13th EPCA reports (ADelt, 457-9) on the discovery of 34 protoGeo, Ar and Cl graves from the 'Kravsidon' cemetery. The majority (20) were cist graves, the others being sarcophagi (4), tile graves (2), trench graves (2) and one enchytrismos. Most were single graves, but some (e.g. cist grave 4, datable to the 5th Ct BC) contained multiple (4) inhumations. The sparse finds, consisting of black glaze pots and lamps, red figure pottery and some white-ground lekythoi, ranged in date from LAr to the end of the 4th Ct BC. Only 13 graves could thus be dated with any precision. Grave 3 was a tholos tomb, with two phases of use, both associated with interments. The later phase, marked by black glaze and red figure pots, dated to the end of the 5th and into the 4th Ct BC. The earlier phase was protoGeo. Finds included trefoil oinochoai (fig. 83), one-handled cups, pendent semi-cir- cle skyphoi (fig. 84), one Geo skyphos and an iron sword. Nea Ionia (Volos), O. Prousis-Thrakis. P.

Reinder Renders reports on the results of the 2002 season of the Sourpi Plain Survey: 'In June to August 2002 the Groningen Institute of Archaeology (University of Groningen, The Netherlands), in cooperation with the 13th EPCA at Volos, continued the archae- ological field survey of the Sourpi plain. In 2002, we focused on the central part of the plain (the E and W sides of the plain, 20 km 1. and 6 km w., were surveyed in 2000). As much of the central part was used to grow cotton, we decided to cover the whole area from Sourpi Bay until Magoula Sourpi, except parts of the flood plain of the Salamvrias which were explored less intensively. In spite of poor visibility, a fair number of archaeological sites was found. Vast areas of the plain were found to be almost empty; with no settlements and only a few sherds per plot. Many of the sites were single-period, and there was just one case of a large scat- ter of material from three periods. Geomorphology of the Sourpi plain. In the context of map- ping the area, we distinguish as units of the landscape: moun- tain area, chain of hills, (dissected) slope deposits, alluvial fans, flood plain, coastal marsh and beach ridge. We also studied the local water regime, based on the main rivers (the Salamvrias and Kerasorrema). Almost all gulleys and riverbeds in the plain were canalized after the 1950s(?) in order to prevent the flood- ing of large areas. Location of the archaeological sites. It is now clear that the greater part of the archaeological sites, dating from Neo to 83 Volos, Agioi Anargyroi: protoGeometric trefoil oinochoai 84 Volos, Agioi Anargyroi: protoGeometric skyphoi mod., is situated on the slope deposits along the W edge of Sourpi plain, mainly on the ridges between small rivers and gulleys. Sites were found on the higher slopes as well as at the lower end of the ridges in the plain. In general the PH and Cl rural sites were located on the higher slopes where the parent material was close to the surface. These areas were less fertile than the clayey lower slopes, but much easier to work with sim- ple agricultural implements. Sites from the LRom and MByz periods, when better agricultural implements were available, were also situated on the lower slopes where the soil is clayey and less easy to work. In the mountain area and the Psilorrachi hills a number of sites with strategic functions was located, for instance the MByz fort W of New Halos and the BA sites Kastraki and Magoula Sourpi. Iindications for postMed villages and monas- teries were encountered here as well, for instance Old Sourpi, Paleochori and Moni Xenias, from a period when the Ottomans dominated the plain. Although, no sites were expected on the alluvial fans, a small number of interesting sites occured in such locations: small LRom and MByz sites near Sourpi Bay (Stomion), a small MByz village with a church and a well, near an ikonosta- sis dedicated to Agios Georgios, and a LRom site with a great variety of pottery in the Paliouri area. The flood plain of the Salamvrias and Kerassorrema covers a vast area of the plain. As expected, archaeological sites were absent, with the exception of a single small MByz site and 19th Ct Greek and Ot forts (between 1832 and 1881 the river Salamvrias marked the border between the Greek Kingdom and the Ot Empire). The lower part of the flood plain, the coastal plain and the beach ridge, surprsisingly, contained some sites: a series of kilns and clay pits in the Armirichia area, which were in use around 1960, and the MBA site of Magoula Pavlina, situated on</page><page sequence="52">52 JAMES WHITLEY a slight elevation in the coastal marsh. The location of the site perhaps indicates that it was situated near open water in a peri- od when the flood plain extended not so far to the N and the coastal marsh was not yet silted up. In total, 45 sites, dating from Neo to Ot, were recorded in 2002: PH period. Much attention was paid to the MNeo site of Kamara, (already found in 2000). In 2002 the SW part of the site was ploughed; a sample of surface material could be col- lected: ceramics, grinding stones, stone tools, obsidian imple- ments, figurines, spoons, bones and mollusc shells. Along the national road, a number of sites were ecxcavated by the archaeologists of the 13th EPCA, including one ENeo site, two small BA sites and IA cemetries. With the exception of some sherds of the MBA, no new PH sites were found. Indications for habitation during the MBA were found between LRom and MByz material on a large site just W of the village ofAgia Triada. It proves that there was MBA habitation outside the three large MBA sites: Magoula Pavlina, Magoula Sourpi and Kastraki. Cl/Hel period. Until now, the number of sites from the Cl and Hel periods related to Cl Halos and Hel New Halos has been relatively low, especially compared to other districts of Greece. Close to the national road, we found two small sites in the Tharka area. The material of one of these - limestone blocks, roof tiles, a pithos fragment, kitchen ware and fine ware - is indicative of a farmstead; the site measured ca 40 x 30m. LHel/ERom period. Only one site dating to the LHel/ERom period, possibly a Rom villa, was discovered (in 1996). Two other, possibly related, sites were found nearby in 2002. One of these was situated on the same ridge close to the river Xirorema. The area is called Touvla (bricks) by the locals. We found a number of thick, round hypocaustum bricks, probably an indication that the villa was provided with a bathhouse. The other site was situated on the next ridge to the S, also close to the Xirorrema. A third site of LHel/Rom times is situated to the W of the village of Agia Triada on a low elevation, where mate- rial dating to the BA and the MByz period was also found. LRom/EByz period. As in 2000, a number of small LRom sites were found, all with the same kind of material at the sur- face: rooftiles, pithos fragments, combed ware and millstone fragments. These sites were situated on the slope deposits to the W of the plain. We had the opportunity also to revisit a LRom site found in 2000 on an alluvial fan in the Paliouri area, where we found kitchenware, fine ware and part of a loomweight, together with the usual artefacts already sampled in 2000. MByz period. Compared to the LRom/EByz period, the MByz period in the Sourpi plain is represented by a great vari- ety of sites: monasteries, a fort, a warehouse and small and large rural sites. In 2002 a large rural site was found in the area W of Sourpi, measuring about 250 x 200m. Here, three low rises with concentrations of glazed ware are possible indications for houses. Moreover a number of rural sites of modest dimensions were found. Altogether, 14 MByz sites were investigated in 2002. They were related to the harbour town of Almyros which flour- ished in the 12th and 13th Cts. Post-Med period. The remains of a fort near the Xirorrema and a Turkish Kislas near Sourpi were investigated in 2002. They dated from the 19th Ct when the Salamvrias was the border river between Greece and Turkey. Six other sites of the postMed peri- od were mapped, among them four killns for the production of bricks and rooftiles in the Armirichia area. Artefact and pottery studies, as well as soil analysis are underway.' Dimitriada. B. Intzesiloglou, A. Bastiou-Efstathiou and P. Triandaphyllopoulou (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 461-5) report on work in five locations. Exploration of the theatre and the 85 Dimitriada: late Roman lamps Hel palace continued. The E Wing of the palace seems to have been re-used as a cemetery in Rom-Byz times. In the W Wing, an entrance with two pilasters was noted. The most significant finds came from the N Wing and the area of the NE tower. Here the installation of the palace seemed to have disturbed some earlier Neo deposits of 'classic Dimini' type. Three kilns and one furnace for bronzeworking were explored. Datable Hel finds came from a nearby pit, which contained loomweights, figurines, sealings and stamped Thasian amphora handles. Elsewhere, at O. Lemesou (Karaiskou plot) a LRom house incorporating earlier Hel spolia and lamps (fig. 85), datable by coins of 330-375 AD, was found to overlie an earlier ERom structure of the 1st2nd Ct AD which had been destroyed by fire. Another LRom structure was noted to the SW and yet another, dated by coins of Constantius II, was found at O. Paphou (Giannakopoulou plot). At the Synoikia Aivaliotika (Korenti plot, O.T. 48) a Rom structure of the 1st -2nd Ct AD and an LRom cist grave were found. Phthiotic Thebes,area of Nea Anchialos and Mikrothivai.

Dr M. Salvatore (Italian School/Milan) and Dr A. Intzesiloglou (13th EPCA) report on the survey work of 2002: 'The discovery of settlements and several buildings outside the urban centre provided us with useful information to recon- struct the anc. settlement patterns and the organization of the S area of the anc. 'tetrarchia', down to the sea. We re-studied the available inscriptions so as to be able to trace the precise borders of the Pherai region, and of other cities, bordering on, connect- ed to, or depending on, Pherai. In the hilly and mountainous areas to the NW and W, bor- dering on the identified regions of Skotoussa and Eretria, we identified some secondary settlements (some of them fortified). Information collected in this area, occupying the upper part of the Enipeos valley towards anc. Pharsalos, may perhaps also be traced from anc. sources, particularly the accounts of famous battles, (e.g. Kynoskephalai in Polybius and Livy). In the region located between the interior plain and the Gulf of Pagasai, we identified the following main sites: Paliokastro Kanalioi and Prophetes Elias at Glaphyroi/Kapoura, on the W slope of Pelion, NW of Pherai and towards the sea; Paliokastro Sesklo, located beyond the region of Dimini and represents the coastal region of the Palioi; further S, Paliokastro Soros, which is very well known but not usually included in modem studies; finally, to the S, Kastro Mikrothivai, towards the sea, and the ECh region of Nea Anchialos, which incorporates the Ar and Cl region of Pyrasos, the commercial port of nearby Thebes of Phthiotis (its acropolis is identified with the Kastro of Mikrothivai). The identification of these historic central places permits us to study the evolution of landscape use in this part of Thessaly from the Neo to the Hel/Rom period, especially the period of the synoikisms of Thivai and Demetrias (late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC respectively). The latter centre in particular, by creating a new big city, played an important socio-political and urban role in the coastal region which was in immediate contact with the regions of Pherai, Iolkos and Pagasai. These well-organized regions, the so-called chorai of these two cities, together with those of other smaller cities such as Amphanoi and Glaphyrioi (whose location remains disputed) become visible through the data we collected. As far as the Ar and C1 periods are concerned (both scarcely attested by excavations in the urban areas), the remains discovered present important information. The anc. road system can also often be indirectly traced through geo- morphology, the distribution of archaeological remains and incidents of survival during later times (kalderimia). Together with a dense fortification system, it suggests a well-organized region with a hierarchy of well-defined public spaces.' NORTHERN SPORADES A.

Tziaphalias (ADelt, 499-501) reports on excavations of the Hel Temple of Apollo Pythios and Poseidon Patroos. Numerous votive inscriptions from the earlier (4th-3rd Ct BC) phase record the names of the deities wor- shipped here. These include Apollo Dorios, Artemis Agagulaia, Artemis Phosphoros, Asklepios, Zeus (Dias) Keraunios, Zeus (Dias) Olympios, Aphrodite and many others. Among these inscriptions were also three Macedonian royal decrees, includ- ing one of Demetrios II and one of Antigonos Doson (ca 221 BC).

Magoula Rachmani. G. Touphexis (ADelt, 508-10) reports on new excavations at this Neo tell, first explored by Wace and Thompson (Prehistoric Thessaly, 28-34). Trench A revealed LNeo and Final Neo levels, but no architecture; the Final Neo levels in trench B, cut by six pits and six wells, had pottery of classic Dimini type; and in trench 02 evi- dence of collapsed mud brick from a Final Neo _ll~ ~building could be discerned. At the base of a well in i':.:.:E- trench A2 thirteen whole pots (amphora and skyphoi) representing the well's use deposit were recovered (fig. 92). Finds include tools of bone, flint, obsidian and quartz. Archaeobotanical and other environmental investigations (chiefly through , -,a l flotation) confirmed the use of wheat and barley and varieties of fruit, including grapes. Rodia Tyrvanou. G. Touphexis (ADelt, 510-12) reports on the excavation of 26 looted subMyc, Geo and Cl graves (18 cist, 8 clay lamakes). The clay lar- nakes seem to date to the 4th Ct BC, but had dis- turbed a Geo funerary peribolos, from which sever- al bronze and iron finds (including a fibula of 'Boeotian' type) were recovered. The cists dated to two phases; one spanning subMyc to Geo times; the other assignable to the 4th Ct BC. Mavrovouni, Palaioskala.

Karapanou and St. Katakouta of the 15 EPCA report (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 512-22) on the excavation of 53 Cl-Hel graves from the area. At the area of Philellenon and Vyronos (and other streets) 38 graves (16 cist, 8 sandstone lamakes, 11 clay lamakes, 1 trench, 2 tile) dating from the 5th to the 2nd Ct BC were excavated. Finds include red figure and black glaze pottery, clay figurines and coins (one ofAntigonos Gonatas). At O. Palaiologou, twelve graves (6 cist, 4 sandstone lar- nakes, 1 trench and 1 tile) contained black glaze and red figure pottery of the 4th-2nd Ct BC. A bronze finger ring with the inscription XAIPE KAIEY was found in cist grave 11. At O. Plastira a cist grave contained 4th Ct black glaze pots, and investigation of four robbed graves (1 square stone box, 3 sandstone lamakes) at Koulia revealed scanty 4th-3rd Ct BC finds. On the NE road, a later clay lamax of the 2nd-1st Ct BC was found. Phauttos. A. Tziaphalias (ADelt, 525) notes the recovery of one Hel votive inscription. Atrax. A.

C NOMOS OF LEFKADA Lefkada. V. Karantzeni and G. Pliakou of the 12 EPCA report (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 595-8 and 602) on rescue work in and around the anc. town. At Kalligoni (Chalikia plot), a wall and tiles stamped AA were found, and at the Stavraka plot five Cl graves (3 sarcophagi, 2 tile). Grave 4 contained 4th Ct black glaze lamps and pots, and grave 1 a bronze mirror with a caryatid handle dating to the 5th Ct BC (fig 93). At Strofi Kalli- goniou a funerary stele was also found. At Fragkokklissia, a further five Cl graves (1 cist, 4 tile) and another funerary inscription were found. Elsewhere, at Lygia (Konaki hotel site) some 4th Ct BC pottery was found, and at Megali Vrysi (Lazari plot) some LHel-ERom remains. NOMOS OF PREVEZA Nikopolis. K. Zachos, A. Georgiou, Ch. Kappa and I. Katsadima (ADelt, 576-95) report on excavation and restora- tion work in and around this Rom city. At the Monument of Octavian Augustus work concentrat- ed on the S part of the outer wall where sherds of grey ware, clay antefixes, parts of a sima moulding, tiles stamped NIKO- MAX[OY and DIAHMONOE were found. More light was shed on the means by which the bronze prows from (captured?) ves- sels were secured to the base of the monument. At the theatre work concentrated on the cavea. Settings for wooden posts to secure the canvas velarium were investigated, and attention drawn to similarities to both Rom theatres and amphitheatres. It was established that a stoa existed above the topmost row of seats. The theatre underwent several phases of construction, beginning with the time of Augustus. At Mantzari twelve rectangular mausolea, two other funer- ary monuments and one apsidal structure belonging to the north cemetery were investigated. Mausolea were constructed in both opus testaceum and opus mixtum. Some mausolea (1,2 and 8) contained niches for holding cinerary urs, others (e.g. 12) sarcophagi (inhumations) and one (16) evidence of both practices. The finds were sparse, since most mausolea had been disturbed: clay lamps (fig. 94), bronze coins. The only (funer- ary) inscription was from mausoleum 12. At Boufi, the west gate and west cemetery of the city were investigated. Tests outside the gate identified two phases of construction, one at the very end of the 1 /beginning 2nd Ct AD, and one in the 3rd Ct. Beyond the gate, of the six tombs (4 cists, 2 sarcophagi) containing lamps and glass dating to the 2nd to 4th Ct AD, only two bore inscriptions. Three further mausolea were also investigated.

This room was covered with a destruction deposit of iron nails and glass dating to the 4th Ct AD. To the E side of the Villa were more mosaics, dating to the 3rd Ct AD. Elsewhere, cleaning and restoration of the city's nymphaea, aqueduct and walls took place (ADelt, 598-600). NOMOS OF ARTA Arta (anc. Ambrakia). A. Angeli, V. Karatzeni, G. Pliakou and Th. Kondoyianni (ADelt, 559-76) report on rescue excavations in the city, which have thrown considerable light on the devel- opment of this Corinthian colony from the late 8th Ct BC until LHel times. Many houses discovered show signs of continuous rebuilding from Ar to Hel times. Finds are reported from over 20 locations: 0. Kommenou (Theodorou plot): 23 Cl-Hel graves (12 cist, 7 trench, 1 tile, 4 sarcophagi); finds include black glaze pots and lamps, a bronze jug with an image of a satyr below the handle (fig. 97), two gold coins/medallions (danakes).

At Glava Kato Meropis, circular structures dating to the LBA/EIA transition were found in the set- tlement and an Ar grave with bronze and iron pins in assocation with the tumulus/cemetery which dates from the 11 to the 2nd Ct BC. On the hill of Anemomylos, surface investigations revealed a number of rectilinear and curvilinear structures. Pithoi and two apsidal structures seem to be of MBA date. Similar structures were found at Ambelia. Konitsa, Liatovouni. A. Douzougli (ADelt, 557-9) reports on further investigations of the cemetery, where sherds of the 9th_7th Ct BC and a bronze vessel of the 5th/4th Ct BC were found. The only near-intact grave was no. 103, datable by its pottery to the early 8th Ct BC (fig. 101). At the nearby settle- ment, structures with curvilinear walls and handmade pottery could be dated to the LBA/EIA transition (12th-10th Ct BC). Konitsa, Lakka. E.

Finds (figurines and female protomes, animal bones, pots, a gold earring and a tetradrachm of Alexander) from a LC1 recti- linear structure at Kyra Panagia perhaps suggest cult practice. Gitani (Demos Philiaton). K. Preka (ADelt, 610-17) notes a number of Hel finds. In the cemetery: sparse finds from 20 graves (12 tile, 8 cremations in amphoras) included black glaze pots and an iron spearhead. Excavation of the Hel structure Tr revealed a 2nd Ct BC destruction horizon marked by tile col- lapse. Finds of the 3rd Ct BC onwards included an iron spear- head, glass, figurines, loomweights and 15 bronze coins. Investigation of the Hel theatre suggested it was constructed in the time of Pyrrhus (3rd Ct BC). The skene seems to have been destroyed during the campaigns of Aemilius Paulus around 167 BC. Names inscribed on the theatre's stone seats include Menedamos, Philista, Charopidas, Pausanias, Timodamos, Antinous, Alexandros, Kephalos, Dokimos, Nikomachos and Nikostratos. Igoumenitsa-Ladochori. K. Preka (ADelt, 617-25) reports on more finds from this Rom-EByz (1St6th Ct AD) settlement. At the Ziagka plot, walls and Rom and LRom pots were noted; at the N. Zoi plot, a complex with a drain, paved area and a build- ing. The destruction horizon included finds of bronze coins, glass and iron nails. At the nearby E. Zoi plot, two structures were excavated. The larger had four rooms with mosaic floors. In room III, there may be a praefumium, which suggests the building may have been part of a bath complex. Finds include clay lamps, glass and 77 bronze coins, dating the period of use to the 3rd to 6th Ct AD. A (later) child's tile grave was found in room VIII. At the Markamba plot there was a Rom road and three rooms from a structure; at the Chrysikopoulou plot walls and a paved area belonging to an ECh complex; and at the Nanousi plot, Rom walls. Igoumenitsa, Morfi. K. Preka (ADelt, 626) notes the collection of 400 MPal stone tools, many Levalloisien. KERKYRA (CORFU) Garitsa, Moka plot: K.

Navsikas 18 (Argyrou plot) an A-EHel complex was investigated. Finds include Ar figurines and pottery, and a hoard of 206 silver coins dating to the end of the 4th, early 3rd Ct BC (fig. 102). Coins included tetradrachms of Alexander, Corinthian drachmas and staters and staters of Kerkyra and Dyrrhachion. At the Spinoula plot, walls were found associated with conical loomweights and LA pottery and lamps (ca 525 BC).

Deeper soundings yielded evidence of Ar floor levels with subGeo and Corinthian pottery. WESTERN MACEDONIA NOMOS OF PELLA Pella. M. Lilibaki-Akamati and P. Chrystostomou of the 17th EPCA (ADelt B Chron 52 (1997) 712-20) report: New site entrance. Work in advance of a new entrance to the site has encountered, in the S part, evidence for at least two Hel workshops associated with metalworking; finds include clay crucibles. In the N part a Hel bath complex of the 2nd Ct BC was explored. The complex was equipped with a cistern and a heat- ing unit (a Hel predecessor of the Rom praefumium). One room had 18 clay bathtubs, and others rooms were covered with hydraulic cement. Palaistra. Further investigation of this large structure (70 x 63m) concentrated on the removal of the level of tile collapse which had covered large parts of the N, E and W stoas, which mostly consisted of rows of small rooms. Finds (pots, nails, animal bones) from these upper levels were sparse, but the tile stamps established a date during Lysimachos' reign (early 3rd Ct BC). To the W was a small bath complex. To the S were two wells, the W well being filled with a deposit of LCl-EHel black glaze pots, Thasian amphoras and Laconian tiles, some stampedBAand others NIK[OAAOY, datable to ca 330-320 BC. Elsewhere, Ta Nea (29/11/2002) notes a large (5.5 x 4m) 3rd Ct Hel stone cist grave with paintings on the interior. Archontiko, Toumba. Excavation of an EBA-MBA settlement (2100-1900 BC) has revealed house remains and evidence of 'prehistoric kitchens'. Finds include handmade pottery decorat- ed with geometric designs. Six graves were found under floor levels (Ethnos 9/10/2002, 64-5). Excavation in the cemetery has revealed 330 EIA-EHel graves: 82 EIA interments were in trenches or cists and 176 Ar graves included interments in wooden coffins in trenches, and were by far the most richly furnished. Finds from male 'war- rior' graves include bronze helmets (some of Illyrian type) and shields, iron swords and spearheads, sometimes decorated with gold appliqu6. Gold masks are also mentioned. Female graves were if anything more richly furnished with gold rosettes, bands, dress pins and gold and silver earrings. Two outstanding LAr female graves were those of a 20- and a 7-year-old. Many of these objects are of local manufacture, but include imports from Egypt, Ionia, East Aegean, Corinth, Attica and Euboea. The 73 Cl-EHel graves are poor by comparison (Ta Nea 16/10/2002; Chora 18/2/2003; Kathimerini 24/8/2002, 14).</page><page sequence="60">60 JAMES WHITLEY Giannitsa B. P. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 720-21) reports on two tests in the area of the Neo settlement. In the Kyriakou plot, three levels (EBA, and two of Final Neo) were excavated. Finds include classic Dimini, black on red and white painted pottery, and 11 figurines. In the Fotia plot, three Final Neo levels could be distinguished; finds include white on red and white painted pots and two figurines. Ambelies Giannitson, Platania. P. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 721-4) reports on test excavations at this Neo tell which had been recently damaged by ploughing and from which 600 fig- urines had been collected from the surface.

Originally investigated in 1992 by S. Kissas, the church was built on the ruins of a 4th-5th Ct AD structure. The church ground plan was cruciform, inscribed within a three- aisle, possibly domed, basilica (23 x 16.50m); a tripartite sanc- tuary (with synthronon and archaizing parabemata), exo- and eso- narthex complete the plan. 1 lth-12th Ct AD pottery, coins and wall-painting fragments suggest a date. A 13th Ct AD earth- 104 Toumba Polyplatanou: Neolithic polished stone axes 105 Toumba Polyplatanou: decorated Neolithic pottery quake destruction date is suggested, and a new church was erected on the ruins (cross-in-square on piers, late 13th Ct AD wall-painting fragments). Both building phases point to similar- ities with metropolitan churches in Macedonia (Veroia, Serres, Servia), underscoring the monument's importance. Investigations showed that the small single-aisle church of Agios Menas at Velvendo rests on an ECh bath complex, used later on as a cemetery site (ADelt 790). The structure belongs to two building phases, of the 12/13th and 15th Ct AD, and contains wall-paintings from this period. At Voskochori, work on the Egnatia Odos uncovered an exten- sive Byz cemetery (56 burials with 1/3 of these childrens') (ADelt 820-3). Some 180m to the E of the cemetery were remains of a cruciform structure, possibly a small Rom bath house. 136 coins were found, including one of Justinian I from Thessalonike. The remains are associated with the LRom settle- ment in the area (Makedonika, 1940, 8-23). _.....</page><page sequence="62">62 JAMES WHITLEY At Psalida or Vigla a Hel-Rom sanctuary was located, possibly belonging to anc.

A 119m stretch of the SW walls, resting on bedrock, was investigated (ADelt 810-12). A treasure of 16 4th Ct AD copper coins was found dating from Licinius to Valens. An adjacent structure provided coins of Crispus and Constantius II, dating it to the time of the walls' construction. Fifty-five burials were located in an organized cemetery; one burial contained a treasure of 4th Ct AD coins (Constantius II to Valentinian I). Some intact pottery and glass ware was also included in the (Ch) burials. CENTRAL MACEDONIA There is a new publication by J.

O. Iasonidou. Makedonia (14/2/2003) notes a 4th6th Ct AD house and bath complex. Seven 4th Ct AD tombs were found on O. Herakleiou 12. Further excavations of an urban villa on O. Antiochou 8-10 sidestreets (Giankinis and Gakidis plots) are reported (ADelt 694, see ADelt 1996, 340). Small finds included (ADelt 492-3) 14 copper coins, bone objects, pottery, marble tile fragments, and coloured mortar fragments from wall-paintings and mould- ed cornices. Items date from LRom to Ot periods. Remains of an ECh villa with triclinum and mosaic floors (geometric motifs) were found at the junction of O. Moreas with Malea (ADelt 695-6). More ECh remains of house walls were found on O. Apostolou Pavlou, with four later ECh tombs. Finds include 37 copper coins of all periods up to Ot, including two Komnenian hyperpyra (ADelt 696). O. Olympiados. Kathimerini (12/7/2002) notes Rom mar- ble sculptures of Isis and Dionysos; Eleutheros Typos (17/2/2003) identifies this as a Rom temple of the Egyptian gods Isis, Serapis and Osiris, dating to the 3rd Ct AD. Evidence for 3rd to 7th Ct AD building phases was found on O. Konstantinou Palaeologou 27, including walls and rough mosaic floors. Repairs to possible earthquake destruction took place in the 7th Ct AD. Parts of a circular cistern were found on upper LByz levels; 439 copper coins were found, together with bone, glass and ceramic objects. A 3rd-Ct AD relief of Aphrodite was found in the fill of the first phase, with inscription: IHAPA- MONOZ KAI APrYPIZ / OEOA^PA TH OPEHITH MN/IAX XAPIN (ADelt 689-91). Part of a stoa and atrium of an ECh villa were found on O. Glaukou 6 (ADelt 691-2). Remains of a mosaic floor with geo- metric decoration were also found. Abandoned after the ECh period, the villa site was reused as latrines in the Byz period. On O. Syntagmatarchou Phryxe 31, 3rd-5th Ct AD burials in a cubiculum were uncovered; 11 further burials and traces of a LByz or E post-Byz house were also found (ADelt 701-2). More tomb finds are reported on O. Peran 19 and 0. Aristatou 10 (ADelt 702). Rescue excavations during the installation of the natural gas pipelines are recorded in various locations in the city centre (ADelt 686-9): three vaulted Christian tombs found on O. Harilaou Trikoupi had traces of non-figural painted decoration (crosses etc., dated to the 6th Ct AD). To the N of these were found traces of a sturdy wall, possibly of a martyrion at the junction of O. Vasileos Herakleiou, originally mentioned in unpublished notes by S. Pelekenides. Sixteen LRom tombs were found on Odos Agiou Demetriou, east of the church. Rom and ECh remains were located on N. Mouschounte square, and three Ch tombs on Odos Bizaniou. Also in the course of pipeline installation numerous walls (56 Rom, 77 Byz, 96 Turkish), drains (5 Rom, 5 Byz, 10 Turkish), wells (1 Byz, 3 Turkish), marbles (43 Rom, 2 Byz) and graves (20 Rom, 48 Byz, 15 Turkish and 15 Jewish) were encountered, as well as four more sections of the city wall. Rom and ECh tower remains were found during investiga- tion of the round tower of the east wall (ADelt 699-700). The Rom tower (6.30 x 6.30m.) is larger than other towers, and stands at a point where the walls change direction. The large (14.30 x 17.70m.) square adjacent ECh tower is possibly of Theodosian date. Kipos DemotikoTheatro (outside the E wall). Remains of a 5th-6th Ct AD workshop complex were found, possibly the remains of a commercial depot associated with a local harbour. Small denomination coins of Constantine I and Thedosios I were found (ADelt 698). A LRom-EByz rectangular structure with three phases (4th6th Ct AD) was also found, and two Byz kilns (Eleutherotypia 24/10/2002, 27). Remains of a Rom tower (Spieser no. 81) resting on bedrock were investigated along the west wall in the Evros dis- trict (0. Sachtouri 37) (ADelt 696-7). Remains of a collapsed floor level were dated by a coin of Romanos I (920-44). Later floor levels included a final use for Ch burial in the early (?) Ot period. Further investigtion of the W wall is reported (ADelt 697-8). Makedonia (8/2/2003) notes 55 LRom-EByz (4th7th Ct AD) graves in the western cemetery. Vaulted and other tombs dating to the 4th-5th Ct AD are reported on O. Margaropoulou (ADelt 692-3). Environs of Thessalonike. Remains of a 6th Ct AD building at Kalamaria (O. Sophoule 79-83) included pottery and a coin of Justinian I, at a site identified by scholars with the Kellarion (ADelt 702). At Palaia (Higher Ecclesiastical School site), foundations of a rectangular ECh structure (possibly a basilica) were unvovered. Burials were found on site (ADelt 703). Part of the cemetery of the Byz village of Mesimeri was found on the N slope to the toumba of Constantine and Helen; 23 LByz burials were investigated on two levels. (ADelt 703-4).

Of the 341 graves of the 9th-8th Ct BC (322 trench, 18 enchytrismoi, one cremation) 42% were those of infants. Finds include 126 pots, 90% of which were drinking vessels, mainly of local bucchero (fig. 109), with only a few examples decorated with protoGeo motifs. Metal finds comprise bronze pins, spectacle fibulae, a bronze disc in the shape of a wheel (fig. 110) and gold bands (fig 111).

In the EIA settlement three phases could be identified. The end of the second phase was marked by a grey layer with signs of burning. Most structures (e.g. building 4), clay floors and a circular hearth could be assigned to the latest phase, dated by the find of a bronze bird 'bottle stopper' of the 8th/7th Ct BC. Nearby were five trenches filled with EIA pottery, ash and animal bone. At the the EIA cemetery 350 cist and trench graves have now been excavated. The rich finds include pottery, bronze jewellery and iron daggers. Female grave 514 had several bronze arm- and finger-rings, two double axes and 40 gold discs. Two of the female graves in a group of five had bronze and gold items, and grave 136 contained a Corinthian helm of the late 6th Ct BC. A group of 22 Ar-Cl graves was poorer, though one had a 4th Ct grave stele. A group of 15 LCl graves contained just black glaze pottery and one spearhead. The Rom phase of the site is repre- sented by a structure and a rectangular kiln. NOMOS OF CHALKIDIKE Potidaia. D.

Kostakis (Thessalonike) report on the 2002 season of excavation of this Neo settlement: 'A third season of excavation was conducted by an interna- tional team with funding from the BSA, INSTAP, Ministry of Macedonia-Thrace and Universities of Sheffield and Thessalonike, and contributions in kind from the Wiener Lab (ASCSA), Dimos Kolindrou and local residents. Excavation proceeded to greater depth in existing trenches on the N, NW and centre of the mound, while the SE and especially S trenches were extended significantly; the total area excavated is now 500m2. In the SE, the LNeo enclosure wall and earlier (MN, rather than early LNeo as first reported) ditch were exposed over a greater length, confirming the results of the geo- physical survey conducted before excavation. It is now clear that the MNeo ditch was deeper and wider than suspected and was apparently filled in with a degree of care exceeding practi- cal requirements. Excavation of several Med-E mod. pits in this area revealed recurrent evidence of apparently structured depo- sition of whole or partial animal carcasses. The S trenches yielded further fragmentary MNeo walls of probably domestic character, while the C trench produced quantities of burnt clay with architectural impressions and mendable MNeo vessels. The N and NW trenches reached bedrock at 2-3m depth, revealing complex sequences of intersecting pits and ditches. Photogrammetry has proved invaluable in enabling rapid and accurate recording of the concentrations of stream pebbles, from collapsed walls or cobbled surfaces that continue to be encountered in all trenches. Excavation has now located in situ deposits of MNeo, LNeo and Final Neo date, and progress has been made in developing a local ceramic sequence (hitherto the Thessalian sequence was used as a guide). The MNeo assemblage includes shapes and decorative styles reminiscent of the southern Balkans as well as of N and W Thessaly; it has also yielded significant evidence for both cooking and storage vessels, somewhat contrary to sug- gestions, based on evidence from S Greece, of a restricted role for ceramics. The LNeo assemblage includes painted vessels of the widespread classic Dimini style, as well as other types known from LNeo sites in Central Macedonia. In the latter types, Paliambela exhibits clear differences with other LNeo sites in the region, but it is not yet clear whether this represents local stylistic variation rather than slight differences in the phases of LNeo excavated. Although the site takes the form of a low mound, with 2m on average of Neo occupation debris, it does not represent a clas- sic compact village of closely-spaced mud-brick buildings. The poorly preserved stone foundations apparently supported a wooden superstructure infilled with clay; there is no evidence for the use of mud-brick. Moreover, while LNeo occupation of parts of the summit of the mound may have been lost to plough- ing and erosion, different phases of MNeo seem to be repre- sented in the N, S and SE of the site, suggesting that habitation shifted across the site through time. While domestic architec- ture seems to have been relatively insubstantial, considerable effort was invested in the creation and remodelling of the MNeo and LNeo enclosure ditches and walls and, in the N of the site, in the cutting of MNeo pits and a probable internal ditch. The spatial organization of the MNeo and LNeo settlement on the Paliambela tell thus has shared characteristics with the LNeo flat-extended site of Makriyialos. Ongoing geoarchaeological analysis of the fills of pits and ditches reveals significant varia- tion in micro-artefacts (burnt clay, daub, ceramic fragments) and sediments (particle size, magnetic susceptibility), suggest- ing that the living environment of the Med-E mod. settlement differed radically from its Neo predecessor. It also seems that the use of space within the Neo settlement was highly differen- tiated, with a restricted range of activities taking place in the vicinity of individual pits. In addition to archaeological research, research of local oral history has recorded valuable information on a range of topics, including pre-mechanized woodland clearance for cultivation (of obvious relevance to Neo farming) and on traditional meth- ods of dry-stone construction with the local materials used on the Neo site. A separate but related research project by Dr Athanasia Krahtopoulou, funded by INSTAP, has located a series of Holocene alluvial fills in the Paliambela valley, demonstrating that the landscape around the Neo site was dif- ferent from that visible today.' Paliambela, Arethousa. Arja Karivieri (Finnish Institute at Athens) reports: 'Excavation and conservation of the mosaics of the ECh church in Arethousa, Paliambela, continued in 2002. The first phase of the conservation of the pavements started in 2000, when the floor mosaics and opus sectile panels that were found in 1994-1995 were cleaned and documented. A preliminary conservation and consolidation took place continuously during three field seasons. The main nave of the church was decorated with four geometric mosaic panels made of coarse pieces of marble, local black schist and spolia with inscriptions, sur- rounded by large rectangular slabs of white marble. The north- ernmost two panels had central circular medallions in opus tes- sellatum. The eastern panel, pre-consolidated in 2001, has a red six-petalled rosette in the centre, and the western panel includ- ed a crater surrounded by a laurel wreath. Unfortunately, the western medallion had been stolen in 1994. The southwestern mosaic panel, with a large lozenge in the centre, was partly destroyed by bulldozer when the site was first discovered in 1994; it has a square set on edge and a circle. The pre-consolidation of the mosaics in the central nave con- tinued in 2002: three large panels with coarse pieces were con- solidated, and the pavements refilled with pure sand and plastic</page><page sequence="67">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 67 sheets afterwards. All of a new mosaic floor, first found in 2001, in the entrance of the N aisle, adjacent to the room with the geo- metric mosaic, was revealed, cleaned and documented. It is of poor quality, and may represent a later phase in the construction of the church. The combination of opus sectile, opus tessellatum and mosaics with coarse pieces is typical of the LRom period in N Greece, but the combination of these pavements and other structures in the church is unique. The 2002 excavation concentrated on the NE part of the church. The most interesting finds occurred in the N aisle of the church, unexcavated until 2000, where an acanthus capital dated to ca AD 500 was found in 2001 by the entrance to the N aisle. Pieces of chancel screen, thorakia, with a floral motif, and a mar- ble bowl were found in the destruction layer inside the N aisle. In 2002, part of the baptistry was revealed NE of the room with the geometric mosaic. It has a cross-shaped baptismal font, with a circular exterior; it was built of stone, brick and mortar, and seems to have had a marble revetment, although only small pieces of marble slabs were found. A fine small marble pilaster was found in one of the cross arms, and several pieces of glass bowls and perfume bottles, probably used in the baptismal liturgy, were found in the comer of the room. A room with a previously unknown mosaic pavement was excavated adjacent to the baptistry. The mosaic, decorated with a central opus tessellatum emblema, a bowl surrounded by a decorative band on three sides, is surrounded by stone slabs and tile fragments. This room was apparently used for special pur- poses as indicated by remains of a rectangular structure in its southern comer. The fact that alternating layers of plaster, lime and earth were found inside the rectangular structure, and that the pavement is missing in this part of the room suggest that the area was possibly used for the preparation of plaster for restor- ing or repairing walls or pavements in the church. In 2002 we also discovered a room that appears to have been used especially for wine-production, in the so-called N aisle of the church, which has changed our interpretation about the his- tory and function of the church. When the upper level of a struc- ture with hydraulic plaster and two parallel walls was exposed inside the N aisle in 2001, it was first interpreted as a cistern. But further excavation in 2002 exposed two shallow basins with sloping pavements, and a well-preserved terracotta pipe in situ in one of the basins, leading through a wall to a large pithos on the other side. Undoubtedly, these are two treading floors for wine production, with terracotta pipes directing the wine to large storage vessels. Furthermore, the room where the storage vessels are located is a large hall with earthen floor, where seven large pithoi were found three of them half-buried in the floor. The best-preserved storage vessel is l.lm deep, round, and had been repaired with lead clamps. This vessel alone could hold hundreds of litres; together with the six other pithoi and amphoras, storage capacity was large. Many fragments of amphoras, amphora lids and stoppers were found here. It may be, of course, that not all the containers served to store wine. A multifunctional character of this room is indicated by two pos- sible hearths, and finds including several tools, raw metal, slags, 15kg of animal bones, and some grape stones. Part of the bone material may come from economic facilities on an upper floor, since some roof tiles had fallen down onto the treading floors together with a large amount of animal bones as well as stone slabs from a pavement. These economic facilities inside the building, as well as the amphoras, pithoi and a hearth found in 2001 N of the main entrance to the church, can be compared with similar structures around other EB churches, especially in Ephesos and Nea Anchialos. Studies for publication have started, and the research will be undertaken by Finnish, Swedish and Greek specialists.' Dion. Recent finds include a mosaic of the 2nd Ct AD depicting wrestlers, at the entrance to the Rom palaistra (Ta Nea 14/2/2003; Makedonia 14/2/2003; Eleutherotypia 22/3/2003, 63-7). Alykon.

Jacques Perreault (Montreal) and Zisis Bonias (Ephor of 18th EPCA, Kavala) report on the excavations of the Greco- Canadian Mission in June/July 2002: 'National road sector. Work was continued in trenches 7223 and 7224. The aim was to reach the pre- and para- colonial levels, estimated to lie at a depth of 6.5m. This is a massive undertaking, due to the great accumulation of stratigraphic lay- ers and the large quantity of ceramics found here. In spite of considerable progress, we have not yet reached those layers. We isolated strata corresponding to the second quarter of the 6th Ct, below them of its first quarter, and some strata dating to the last quarter of the 7th Ct. SE sector. Studies concentrated on buildings E and F. In building E, we have completed the excavation of room E3 and cut through the 5th Ct floor in the large room E2. The informa- tion recovered here permits a better understanding of the archi- tectural development of the building, and of its different occu- pation phases. Under the 5th Ct floor in E2, we have excavated an older floor, from the 2nd half of the 6th Ct. Thus, the con- struction of the building belongs to that time, as do other struc- tures in the sector. Similarly to building A, the structure only gained its definitive shape after major modifications at the beginning of the 5th Ct. In this period a new interior face of small cut marble and poros blocks was applied to the walls. Continuation of the excavation of building F provided us with a pleasant surprise. Considering the immense thickness of the deposit of earth covering this building (over 8m), we decid- ed to start by excavating its facade along the main road, to assert the precise W edge of the structure. It turned out that at its western end, the facade abuts the corer of another building (which we have simply called G). This building G, of which only the SE comer has been excavated so far, is extremely well preserved, and the size of the stones used in its construction, as well as its careful execution, indicate that it is the most impor- tant structure so far excavated in that sector. Acropolis sector. Our Greek colleagues have excavated the area to the S of the great Hel house, aiming to establish the rela- tionship between it and a nearby Hel complex. They uncovered an access-way leading to the porticus of the house, which was constructed on top of older structures. Several other architec- tural elements belonging to that edifice permit us to confirm certain hypotheses concerning its upper floor, especially regard- ing the presence of windows.' Philippoi, theatre. A Rom rock-cut underground chamber underneath the 'arena' (orchestra) of the theatre is interpreted as a pen for wild animals for Roman beast fights (Eleutherotypia 17/2/2003; Adesmeftos Typos 24/7/2002). THASOS The French School conducted fieldwork and study seasons in Thasos. Francine Blonde, Arthur Muller, Dominique Mulliez and Fran9ois Poplin report on the French School excavations on the Valma property, NE of the Agora: 'During the 1999 season, excavation work in trench XXIX, which had been opened to confirm or investigate the existence of a stratigraphic continuity between the two previous trenches - unexpectedly brought to light an extremely interesting collec- tion of animal bones (cf. BCH 124 (2000), Chronique, 520, ? 1.3 and fig. 15; AEMTH, 2002, forthcoming). The study cam- paign of 2001, led by Francois Poplin, has provided a full expla- nation of this collection: deposited in a large flat-bottom pit are the remains of three animals, which were cut into two parts (front and back); the articulated bones of each of the halves were then grouped into two distinct piles. The three animals where a bovid, a ram, and a pig. This find corresponds to the trittoia sacrifice, as described by Callimachus of Cyrene. In September 2002, we continued work in that trench.under the supervision of S. Papadopoulos (18th EPCA). Sifting of the earth moved in 1999 led to recovery of some extra bone frag- ments, completing the animal skeletons. The sounding was extended it to the S by 1.5m, to the wall that separates porch 15 from the room of the pillars 17b (fig. 114). Thus, we found the posterior half of the ram and were able to confirm, with cer- tainty, the existence of a trittoia, in which each of the victims had been cut into two sections at the level of the lumbar verte- brae (fig. 115). Along the wall between buildings 15 and 17b, we located a trench opened during excavations in the 1950s, which destroyed the stratigraphic sequences between the pit containing the bones and the buildings. The ceramics recovered in the extension confirmed our sugges- tion of a 4th Ct date for the trittoia. While the filling that con- tained the bones did not supply any supplementary means of dating in itself, it had been cut by another, more recent pit, which contained a great number of very characteristic pottery fragments, dated to after the third quarter of the 4th Ct. Although we were not able to specify the context of this trit- toia, it now appears that the pit dug probably occupied the area of an older pit, which contained the elements of a pig skeleton. Indeed, in the stratum containing the skeletons of the trittoia, in 1999 and 2001, we also recovered some fragments of pig bones (which do not necessarily belong to the same specimen). The trittoia pit was dug on the site of two further pits, of a different nature, which were subsequently cut into the same location. The trittoia seems to represent the final animal bone deposit in a specialized place where other sacrifices had been previously performed. Thus, we conclude first, that the ritual carried out at the time of the trittoia is not isolated and second, that other sacrifices were carried out in this part of the city. We will also compare the successive pits identified in trench XXIX with the pits identified in 1994 in trench XXIII against the monument of Glaukos (BCH 119 (1995), 687-688).' Anne Coulie reports on the French School study season (April and May 2002): 'We studied the Or Thasian ceramics. The main difficulty in interpretation is the distinction between Parian imports and local production; some progress on this was made, especially for later periods, when the Thasian workshop freed itself from the workshops of its mother country. The local workshop was founded, at the latest, during the second half of the 7th Ct (there is some Thasian subGeo, but it is late). The first work of the Thasian black figure workshop represents the period of transi- tion away from the Or workshop at the beginning of the 6th Ct BC.' Marie F. Billot (CNRS) reports on the study of architectur- al terracottas (April 2002): 'In 2002, as in 2001, material from the Athenaion, and from older excavations on the acropolis was studied. As the Cl tem- ple probably had a marble roof, it is less clear from which build- ings the terracotta roofs recovered come. We can now distin- guish two different series of antefixes, type A (fig. 116) and B (fig. 117), belonging to two distinct buildings, one of which was most likely the Ar temple, while the other one may have been a propylon, and/or other buildings on the acropolis. We have also been able to reconstruct the process of producing (with double moulds) decorating and assembling the antefixes. Antefixes with felines belong to the theatre and the Evraiokastro, geese antefixes to the Artemision.</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 69 114 Thasos, agora: plan of the northeast area 0 0.50 - I - 115 Thasos, agora: reconstruction of trittoia sacrifice 116-117 Thasos, Athenaion: /W \ / Archaic(?) antefixes type A type B rds nord-esi de I'agora The fragmentary state of the other aux.adminisraUil nrd -es pieces from the acropolis only permits )riquc nord-est onument de Gauko partial reconstruction of two Ar roofs alene aux pillers .ssaC deCTh6orcs from the sanctuary of Athena.

Two big fragments of simas seem to come from the roof of the acropolis. Their decoration is no longer visible, but their profile reproduces that profile of most Cycladic marble simas (between ca 520- ca 460 BC). The pieces that appear to come from the roof of the acropolis include egg-decorated cover-tiles, ante- fixes with symmetrical concave volutes surmounted by a palmette and an acro- terion. This combination (of tiles-ante- fixes-palmette-acroterion) is similarly attested in Abdera, Maroneia, Mesembria (sanctuary of Apollo) and Linos (nomos of the Rhodope). Thus the place or places of production and the origin of the arti- sans are problematic.' Bernard Holtzmann worked on a computerized catalogue of sculpture in Thasos museum; Clarisse Pretre is cata- loguing the small finds from the Artemis- ion excavations. Grandjean-Salvat reports on work on the fortifications: 'This year work focused on three sec- tions of the circuit wall: Between Evraiokastro and the theatre, we continued to clear the internal face of the circuit, where (in 2001) we had revealed a staircase. We discovered a 3 m postern, at a distance of 4.50m from the first step of the staircase. The passage entrance, on the city side, was at the ground level contemporary with the construction of the rampart. On the external wall face, the threshold, formed by four marble blocks (one of them missing), is more than 1.25m above the present ground level, but the difference was greater in antiquity. About 100m S of this first trench, we worked on the circular tower sited below the theatre. We noted that the external face of the circuit wall continues into the tower. It is made from gneiss blocks, smaller than those on the N of the tower, and was con- nected with the lateral walls of the tower. Along the axis of the altar discovered in 2001, a wall of coarser construction started to run (perpendicular to this internal wall) and reached the back of the facade wall. In this way, it consolidated the course of the tower, which was reinforced by earth in its lower part. Sector of the Parmenon gate (fig. 118). We have been able to determine the departure point of the section which, on the other side, leaned against the NE facade of the tower near the gate, and gave access to the rampart walk. Cleaning here revealed a very dense emplekton, which had been built into steps. We also found two new mason's marks from the Parmenon quarry. The first one was on a block of the internal wall face, the other one on a block of a wall (parallel to the circuit wall) which was built inside the emplekton itself.'

The publication by P. Bernard, 'Ceramiques de la premiere moiti6 du VIIe s. a Thasos', BCH 88 (1964), 77-146, with its historical interpreta- tion of the stratigraphy, soon became an important point of ref- erence for all discussion of the Greek colonization of the north- ern Aegean, and for North Aegean ceramics of the 8th and 7th Ct BC. A critical reading (A. Muller, Topoi 10 (2002), 13-16) has demonstrated that the historical comments made based on stratigraphy were flawed, so in September 2002, the trench was reopened in order to recheck the layers and restudy the older ceramics. The W part of the trench (G2) was not fully reopened. On the upper levels (walls A and B were built at the end of the Ar period along a street which remained in use until the end of antiquity) and on the intermediate levels (constructions C D, E and F, from the end of the 7th Ct), our investigations revealed new information, especially regarding the architecture, but not so much from a stratigraphic point of view. For example, it is now clear that wall A was built at the beginning of the 5th Ct, that its foundations are what has so far been misunderstood as wall F, and that it was partially reused at the end of antiquity. However, the most important results of the sounding concern the deep levels, offering a new chronology and a new strati- graphic interpretation which may be summarized as follows. The thick layer (W), interpreted in 1960 as related with the apsidal wall K, is now seen to correspond to a long period of occupation, in the first half of the 7th Ct BC (W1), which ended with destruction by fire (W2). Level Wl (also proved to be a complex sequence) has been subdivided into two periods, the first related to wall P, which was not recognized in 1960 and the second related to wall K, which is surrounded by a ditch; this consists of four different phases (construction, occupation, destruction, abandonment). We exclude the theory that W2 is a fire layer, and the conditions of its (probabily) rapid formation are under study. The whole W sequence ends in the first decades of the 7th Ct BC. Layer X had previously been understood as a filling of construction material, but it is in fact a natural filling (colluvium). Layer Y is identical to W2; fire is also excluded here. Layer Z had been understood as a preparatory filling for the construction of walls C, D, E and (F), it is com- posed of a succession of colluvional beds in a zone of ," craft activity which is testified by two sites of forges. ...t. The abundant presence of vegetable charcoals and slugs throughout the deep levels, from W to Z, suggests that we are indeed in the immediate proximity of a workshop context connected with iron working. A sim- ilar situation (an iron working context) was already found in a deep layer at the nearby Artemision (BCH 104 (1980), 729). What had once been understood as evidence for conflicts between colonists and indige- nous peoples now seems to be associated with large- scale metallurgic activity which was, for the most part, 7.&lt; pre-Greek. This revision of the data from trench G throws a different light the beginning of the IA in Thasos, and the conditions of the arrival of the Greeks from Paros. It confirms the picture of protohistoric Thasos recently sketched by Hp. Koukouli (Protoistoriki Thasos (1992), 701-736). THRACE chariots with iron spoked wheels and bronze fittings were found within the tumulus, accompanied by horses (two per chariot) which seem to have been sacrificed. Dog burials were also found. At the centre of the tumulus was a large (4.2 x 2.2m) trench, containing the cremated remains of both a man and a woman, accompanied by rich grave goods (the woman having gold ear- rings) (Ethnos 6/2/2003, 50; 14/2/2003, 57; Kathimerini 8/2/2003; 14/2/2003, 15; Eleutheros Typos 15/2/2003, 17).

The second excavated area, corresponding to modem zones 14 and 24, is located on the terrace NW of the baths and the aim was to identify and date a building excavated by Becatti (1937) and cleaned in 2001. Several layers were related to these build- ings, which defined two spaces, one of them open-air. The lat- ter underwent several transformations and modifications during the Rom period. Previous phases of Hel walls were also found. In the area between the Hel baths and the 'house with the columns', excavation of the NE/SW road continued (zone 100). Here, the margins of an urban quarter located SE of the road came to light (zones 11 and 21). A crossroad with a road run- ning NW/SE, and some LRom rooms were identified. Excavations in zones 13 and 23, located NW of the baths, detected the edges of LRom buildings facing the street. The largest of them, oriented NW/SE, has been exposed for several meters, allowing us to identify two different building phases during which the building's width changed. A small perpendi- cular road was also found. In zones 12 and 22 a room of a LRom building facing a road running NW/SE was excavated. A previous phase of this build- ing presents a different plan and will be investigated further. On th S edge of the area is the edge of a second road running NE/SW, at a lower level.'

The BSA/20th EPCA study season took place in January and February 2003, directed by Dr Lesley Beaumont and Mrs Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri. Work in Chios Archaeo- logical Museum, focused on pottery and small finds excavated in the sanctuary of Apollo Phanaios between 1999-2001. Dr Nicola Wardle (Bristol) studied the PH ceramics and small finds, Dr Lesley Beaumont (Sidney), assisted by Marcella Pisani (La Sapienza, Rome) studied the Geo and Ar ceramics, Angeliki Tsigkou (20th EPCA) the Ar bronzes, and Hugh Beames (Sidney) the LRom EByz pottery and small finds. Most of the PH material, including ceramics, terracotta ani- mal figurines and a marble sword pommel, would seem to belong to the LH IIIB, LH IIIC and subMyc phases, though a few sherds may be protoGeo. Geo and Ar finds span the 8th to early 5th Ct BC, with three architectural construction phases dating to the 7th, 6th and perhaps E 5th Ct. Material of the Cl and Hel periods is rare within the sanctuary itself, but more plenti- ful across the surrounding area. Quite clearly, the 5th and 6th Cts AD saw a resurgence in the sanctuary's fortunes, with the con- struction of a large ECh basilica and ancillary buildings, rich in local and imported ceramics and small finds.

Later finds include apsidal house plans, bronze tools, a gold amulet, figurines and an intramural child's burial. Delos The French School continued a number of studies on Delos. M.- F. Billot reports (May 2002): 'Study of the architectural terracottas has been largely completed. Simas, antefixes, and eaves tiles belong to several main groups: (a) an Ar gorgoneion-antefix, possibly imported from Paros. (b) the Ar simas and eaves-tiles from the Heraion, whose place of production has not yet been identified. (c) Cl and Hel pentagonal antefixes, a very varied group, represented in Delos (eight series at least, with vegetal decoration) Tinos, Naxos, Samos and the N of the Black Sea. (d) Ar, Cl and Hel antefixes of insular style, characterized by a palmette engraved in an arch, often with alternating large and narrow leaves (e.g. fig. 120), also attested in Eretria and in Tinos. Antefixes from the Archegesion and from B sanctuary of the Cynthion seem to be of local production. (e) In the insulae 'of the comedians' and 'of the jewellery, bronzes and seals' in the gymnasium GD 76, in the institution of the Poseidoniasts, and in the agora of the Italians, many series of antefixes and of simas - the moulds of which, at least, are originally from Athens (identical types have been found in the Kerameikos and in the Agora) - offer some important archaeological data on the Attic production. (f) A series of antefixes with a pair of wings surmounted by a palm- tree, also used in the sanctuary of Yria in Naxos. (g) Eaves-tiles with meander in relief, which were very common in Asia Minor, the Aegean and in the Pontus. Their chronology and provenance remains very uncertain.

Wurch-Kozelj report on excava- tions in 2002: 'Study of the wells E of the temple of Apollo: the report of the excavations by Durrbach in 1903 mentions 'a well cut into the rock, towards the SE comer of the temple; this well was certainly artifi- cial, because its section is clearly rectangular and its walls are vertical; its dimensions are about 5 x 5m. It was cut to a depth of 5m' (CRAI, 1903, 424). We have dug a series of trenches in this area, but the well could not be located. The same applies to another large round, well (5-6m di., and 3-4m d.), also found in 1903 (CRAI 1903, 348). Circular structure in the area N of the sanctu- ary of Apollo (L. Chevalier). We tried to explain a structure protected by a modem parapet of stones in the NE of the hieron, S of GD 31 (square II 8). The walls of this structure were covered by a (crude) clay layer, slightly baked on the surface. The cleaning of the external face of the stones showed that these wall had been strengthened in places by the addition of small blocks. The bottom, surrounded by a course of stones, had disappeared. These circular structures, with clay-covered walls, and of which we have other examples in Delos, have been interpreted as ovens. On the basis of the fill underneath this layer (lagy- nos, West Slope ware) they can be dated Hel or later. Paving NW of the hieron (C. Durvye), fig. 121. Although they failed in their main aim, to clarify the ongoing discussion about access to the sanctuary, soundings allow us to date the gneiss slabs of the road here. On removing these slabs, it turned out that they had been moved before, probably in the 1950s. The layer of earth directly underneath, with much Hel pottery, should not be considered ancient, whereas the 12cm-thick pebble bedding below, which contained packing-stones and a fair amount of other materials (bones, coarse ware, amphoras), i Megarian cups, indicating a 1St Ct BC terminus post , the stratum. To the E of the paving, the pebble bedding ed the slabs by 0.50m. In the space between the pebble the external face of the wells, we found moder fills, from the 1903 excavations (diary Bizard-Vallois AHE To the W of the paving, we also found fillings tl extremely rich in archaeological material (amphor painted plaster, Hel coarse ware, a Megarian bowl extended to the bottom of the rock and are probably t of modern trenches. Three soundings piercing the pebble bedding revea layers of pebbled compact soil, which were hard to da the small quantities of finds in them (a copper fragme Ar sherds, a Hel lustrous black sherd). At the N limit B, two parallel rows of gneiss slabs lay on the pebbly whole may represent a drainage layer before the pebble was added. Under the pebbled soil, in the SW part of (N of the marble water-pipe which crosses the road Artemision porch) a drain made by a set of overturned ' cover tiles was found. It follows the layout of the wa then diverges from this path in a NW direction. In the of the trench, on the other side of the slabs in situ, w find any corresponding remains. The relation between these drainage installations movement of the people in this area must be clarified: clearly trace a SE axis of movement, joined by a sec&lt; directed towards the N exit of the sanctuary. The roa 121 Delos: plan of the area northwest of the Hieron surrounds the wells, and the remaining space was paved to form an area around them. In the agora of the Italians, a trench was opened to verify the anomalies recorded by an electro-magnetical survey con- ducted in M15 in 2000 (cf. BCH 2001, 612-14), which was found not to have been caused by structures, but by a layer of stones. The trench, 1.8m below soil surface, revealed a series of horizontal fills, caused by the raising of the ground in associa- tion with a Rom building. A layer of blocks, mostly of gneiss (marble blocks being very rare) lay below the humus. Under this was a thick fill of ashes with many sherds, in turn above a sandy layer; below, in the NE corer, complete Rom amphoras had been thrown. Virgin soil or the bedrock were not reached here. The layout and material (Delian house type) of these strata indicate that they represent a fill contemporary with the agora of the Italians. Study of the many stamped amphora handles may provide a more precise date.' H. Sarian reports on activities at the Heraion: 'In July we excavated four sectors (trenches I-IV) of the Heraion. In the NE corner of the altar (trench I) we recovered three marble slabs of the eschara (mentioned by Plassart, 1928); the fourth slab has not been found. Among the blocks lying around the Heraion terrace we recovered four marble blocks which seem to belong to a third step of the krepis of the altar and moved them beside the altar, which will be reassembled. Trenches II and III have not produced interesting results, although trench II, in the SW corer of the pronaos, yielded a very significant quan- tity of Hel sherds, from the spoils of the large-scale excavations. '-- --</page><page sequence="74">74 JAMES WHITLEY P- --- - 122 Delos, Heraion: Hellenistic pottery The most recent trench, IV, W of the temple, is located between the temple and the retaining wall of the terrace, where J. Ducat had already excavated in 1964. Between the precinct wall and the retaining wall of the terrace, we found a piece of wall made of granite and gneiss (wall Z), now visible in the N face of the trench. All the area to the W of this trench has pro- duced a large quantity of Hel ceramics (fig. 122). This seasons's ceramics (over 900) and Ar pottery from Bernard's 1953-58 and Ducat's 1964 soundings were studied.' Claire Hasenohr (French School) reports on the agora of the Competialists': 'Throughout 2002, work continued on topographic survey of insula X, the surroundings of the agora of the Competialists (streets around insulae X, XII, XIII). Excavations took place in June 2002. Four trenches were opened as part of the research programme on 'Water in Delos', along the axis of the Inopos rover, the first (trench V) in the E, the second (IX) in the W, and two more (VI, VIII) in the centre of the area. Despite difficul- ties caused by the high water table, a stratigraphy of natural and human deposits could be delineated, and samples for scientific study were taken. Trench VII (in area K of insula XIIb) aimed to find the eastern- most extent of the foundations of the 'porch of the pillars with half-columns', discovered in trenches IV and VII in 1999 under the N wall of areas zl 0 and v. Only occupation layers were dis- covered in VII, especially a pit, its edges surrounded by tiles, which was was full of ceramic material. The aforementioned porch was found in trench III, and corresponded exactly with those found in 1999, but in a N/S orientation. This means that the porch did not enclose the S front of the agora of the Competialists but turned toward the S, surrounding an inde- pendent building. To clarify its extent, a small trench (XI) was opened in area U, but only occupation layers associated with the walls of that room were found here. The porch will be pursued further; 28 pillars and 10 capitals from it have been added to the inventory. Trenches I and II were dug to verify the hypothesis that the E porch of the agora of the Competaliasteses (discovered in 1995) continued toward the S, and predates the construction of insula XIIb, and to clarify the dating of that insula. No traces of any foundations belonging to a porch were found. Instead, trench I revealed several occupation layers in room H, most notably a circular paving around a stone floor, probably indi- cating the existence of a mill. Under that floor, a pithos was found in situ . Trench II produced few results because of a recent disruption. The ceramic finds in both trenches, seem to suggest that occupation began in the Ar period. Trench IV was dug to verify the existence of a porch which had supported a projecting wing in front of insula XIV and returned toward the 'street of the porticoes'. We found no porch, but only a squared base of gneiss quarry stones (proba- bly the foundations of a honorary monument base) and a suc- cession of floors made of small pebbles and pockets of stone, possibly related to those of trench III, excavated in 1995 . A small additional trench (X) confirmed the absence of porch foundations. Instead, it contained the existence of an oven or of circular silo.' Christian Le Roy continued preparations for publication of, amongst others, the House of the Stuccoes and the Fourni House. Emmanuelle Benchimol reports on study of treasury 5, from the Sanctuary of Apollo. 'This building, of which only the foundations remain today, turned out to be the oldest of the five small monuments which are arranged in an arc around the P6rinos Naos (cf. Guide to Delos, plan I). The remains in situ exhibit some distinctly Ar features, making it a rare example of Cycladic architecture from that period. Because of its position at the heart of Apollo's precinct, the structure is of special relevance regarding the beginning of urbanization of the sanctuary. A detailed study and recording of the monument was begun.' Helen Siard reports on excavations at Sarapieion C (August 2002): 'Four trenches were excavated, at the S end of the dromos terrace and in storeroom 4 below the sanctuary, in Sarapieion C. Trench V of the 2001 season had exposed a construction now identified as an altar, the excavation of which could be completed. In appearance the altar, is a square construction, 2 x 2m. Its walls are better preserved on the E than on the W side. The fill inside the altar was 30cm lower inside than on the out- side, indicating that the construction was sunk into the ground. On the other hand, between the W wall of the altar and the E wall of temple C, the level of the bedding was lower. It there- fore appears that, at the time of activity in the sanctuary, the soil level of the W surroundings of the altar was lower than that of the E surroundings. This suggests that there was a standing wall surrounding the altar on the W side, of which only two small blocks of the first course are preserved. Inside the altar, first in its E part, then during extension of the trench to the W and N, we removed layers of ashes. In that deposit, seals and coins seem often associated. Both are well distributed in the altar (in terms of height and area), but unex- pected concentrations occured, notably in stratigraphic unit 513 (the SE comer of the altar), where 13 more or less fragmentary seals have been recovered, as well as 6 bronze coins. M. Le Guilloux, in a preliminary report on faunal remains from the altar, states that out of 3,549 bone fragments, 92.2% belong to birds (hens and roosters), the rest are of varied species. Trench VI (2 x 2m) was opened in the NW comer of the cella of temple C, facing the internal faces of the W and N walls of the cella. Soon after the removal of a ground layer which probably predated the excavations carried out at the beginning of the century, we reached a layer (stratigraphic units 603, 604, 605 and 606) of brown earth containing little ceramic material but many imposing blocks. The foundation shaft of the temple was not reached, as it must lie too deep for such a narrow trench (and we reached the water table). The removed layer remained homogeneous throughout the trench, but became more so towards the bottom. The foundations of the W and N walls of the cella indicate a particular form of masonry. There is a layer of hydraulic plaster (often in bad repair) between the joints. The faces of the blocks were polished. Could the corer of temple C have housed some type of hydraulic mechanism (utilising the water-bearing stra- tum that we had reached)? Not knowing the exact configuration of this 'well', we are not able, as yet, to specify how it operat- ed. It was been filled with a homogeneous layer, probably derived from the destruction and abandonment of temple C.</page><page sequence="75">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 75 Trench VII was opened between the western face of the W wall of temple C and the W wall of the Sarapeion terrace, in order to verify the dates of the layers associated with the construction of this tem- ple and to date the retaining wall of the S terrace of the Sarapeion (which we failed to do in the previous year). We first encountered a very thick layer of rubble from previous excavations and below this reached the level of the anc. fill along the whole sur- face of the trench. The fill contained ceramic mate- rial which was similar to the that discovered in 2001. The date of construction of the temple should probably not be put before the end of the 2nd Ct BC. It is probably contemporary with the planning of the W wall of the S terrace of Sarapeion C. Trench VIII aimed to clear storeroom 4, below the southern terrace of the sanctuary. The excavations conducted here in 2001 (trench I) had provided us with some satisfactory chronological indications 123 Kytt concerning the abandonment of the room, but we had not been able to clear it entirely. In order to facilitate the removal of old excavation dumps, we dismantled the wall obstructing the room's door (after recording it). In 2001, we had established that the structure had, after its abandonment, been used as a dumping ground for surrounding buildings, notably a glassmaker's shop. This year, many glass fragments were recovered. Furthermore, two Doric capitals, one of which is incomplete, belonging to a porch of Sarapieion C, were found. We may asso- ciate them with a set of blocks from that porch (the reconstruction of which is quite advanced). The incomplete capital could confirm the hypothesis that the porch was destroyed while it was under con- struction.' Michele Brunet reports on the ongoing work of the 'Water in Delos' research programme: 'Study of cisterns in three shops and five houses of the theatre area and the stadium, was completed. This will provide us with a complete picture of the different technical solutions for nderground water 124 Kytt storage. Study of fossil beach rocks in Delos, Mykonos and Rhenea, with the assistance of Kosmas Pavlopoulos and Georges Simia- kakis (Geology Department, Harokopio University, Athens), aims to assess sea level change during the last 6,000 years, and verify the hypothesis of a rise of ca 2m since antiquity. Study continued of the nature and character of the water resources available in anc. Delos. It seems most likely that it was the (high) level of inter-annual variability, rather than the overall weakness of precipitation, that would have caused prob- lems for the inhabitants of the anc. city. The project is also con- cerned with the relationship between the Inopos and reservoir GD 97, and with the 'lake', which was supplied by the water- bearing stratum and - as has been confirmed- functioned, exclusively, as a well.' Kythnos Alexander Mazarakis Ainian (University of Thessaly) reports on the excavation of the anc. town of Kythnos (Vryokastro): 'After a survey in the 1990s, the first excavation season took place in September 2002, in collaboration with the 21st EPCA, represented by Mrs Vassiliki Yannouli, in the N part of the Middle Terrace, in the upper town of Kythnos (about 110m asl). The survey had sug- gested the location of a sanctuary and a cult building there. hnos, Vryokastro: view of the Archaic temple from the southeast mos, Vryokastro: view of the adyton We discovered an Ar temple, orientated towards the W (fig. 123). The building is placed upon a terrace contained by a strong retaining wall, much of which is still preserved, integrat- ed into the interior of a recent structure. The temple has a small adyton (ca 3 x 2m) (fig. 124) and a sekos (main room, 5 x 3m). It is not clear whether there was a pronaos, as the front of the building is not preserved. Between the naos and the adyton, there existed a thin cross wall, 0.25m wide, with a monolithic threshold (1.5 x 0.5m) at the opening (w. 0.85m.). The maxi- mum preserved height of the wall of the adyton is lm. The temple is surrounded by a foundation (ca 14.65 x 8.65m), which is not preserved in the N and W. In view of the fact that no frag- ments of stone column drums were found, the interpretation of that feature as a peristyle remains a hypothesis. Should it prove correct, we will have to accept that the colonnade and entabla- ture were wooden. There are some indications - to be tested during the next excavation period - that the peripheral con- struction was added during a second architectural phase, but interpretation as a peribolos wall of the temenos cannot be excluded. The numerous scattered roof tiles, most of which come from around the temple and especially from the undis- turbed adyton, indicate that the roof consisted of tiles of Corinthian type. The walls of the sekos and the adyton, 0.55m wide, were constructed exclusively of schist. On the outside,</page><page sequence="76">76 JAMES WHITLEY 125 Kythnos, Vryokastro: gold pendants 126 Kythonos, Vryokastro: Minoan camelian seal orthogonal blocks of large dimensions were used, whereas the inside has a dressing of small rough stones. To the E and N, the ground was unstable, in consequence of a levelling fill of irregular stones which had been placed inside the cavities of the natural bedrock. For that reason, the walls are founded upon large stone slabs. The slight inclination of the walls and the absence of traces of burning, perhaps suggest that the temple was destroyed by an earthquake. The sekos was exposed up to the original ground level (there was no fill) and only few, but interesting, votive offerings were recovered. In contrast, the adyton has not suffered the slightest disturbance, and in the beaten earth floor, as well as the destruc- tion fill above it, numerous precious votive offerings were found in situ. The finds consists of approximately 1,500 objects, mainly jewellery and small finds, many of fragile materials, but also a good number of complete vases, some broken due to the collapse of the temple's roof. The location of the finds in the room suggests that many of them were placed on wooden shelves affixed to the walls, while others might have been attached directly to the walls or suspended from the roof. In the axis of the adyton, in contact with the rear (E) wall, a cylindri- cal clay base was discovered. It is possible that this served as a base for a crude cult statue, a xoanon made of perishable mate- rial (wood?). It is possible that some of the jewels found at the foot of that base, especially bronze fibulae and pins, and in the immediate proximity, may have decorated the clothing of the xoanon. More specifically, on the floor of the adyton, as well as in the destruction fill that covered it, the following categories of intact finds were found: Ca 70 pieces of gold jewellery other gold objects, mostly amulets, such as pomegranates, poppy seeds, biconical kerel- or vase-shaped beads, various grains, multi-petal rosettes (some of gilded silver), double axes, pins, a twisted amulet, a bracelet of twisted wire, a ring, as well as two fragments of hammered plate decorated with a procession of chariots, all of exquisite quality (cover and fig. 125). Ca 120 silver pins, fibulae, earrings, rings, rosettes, tubular- shaped pendants and other amulets, including some unfamiliar types, such as a stragalos (knucklebone) and a double axe. Ca 450 bronze objects, including fibulae, pins, earrings, hair rings, an omphalos phiale, various amulets, a wheel, bracelets and finger rings and a miniature shield. Of specific interest is a lotus-shaped flower of solid bronze (h. 7.67cm) with a stem, perhaps for insertion in a statue or belonging to a sceptre. Ca 100 iron objects, including pins and fibulae, as well as nails; ca 300 bone jewels and small finds, some of ivory (for example, numerous spectacle fibulae, fibulae of Italian type, double axes, beads from necklaces, various plaques). Numerous jewels and beads (from necklaces) of camelian, rock crystal, glass paste, faience, semi-precious stones, many of which bear incised or relief representations (for example, a grif- fin, sphinx, deer or goat, bird etc.). An amygdaloid talisman bead with an incised representation of a ship, which belongs to the LBA and comes from Crete (fig. 126); this must have been a heirloom. Several of the rock crystal amulets are vase-shaped and presumably Ar in date, while some polyhedral objects of the same material may be BA. Egyptian scarabs of faience (22nd and 26th dynasties) and insular scarabs, various orientalia such as relief-decorated seals, discs with relief decoration (sphinx, goat etc.), heads of human figures (mostly of ivory), Phoenician glass beads (for instance rock-cut pendant type) and other small finds from the East, among them two small heads of bearded figures of faience. Seventy fragmentary and complete terracotta figurines, mostly seated female figures. Numerous complete and many fragmentary clay vases, imported from various regions of the Aegean world. Most of them bear painted decoration and figural decoration. The fol- lowing categories may be mentioned: Cor (mostly E and M); Attic black figure, some of high quality and by known painters (e.g. a black glazed Siana cup with a symposion scene and an equestrian contest on the exterior and a Triton on the tondo in the interior, probably by the Taranto painter, ca .560 BC); Parian ('Melian'); Chian; Rhodian; East Ionian etc. The shapes include many toilet vessels, such as plemochoes, pyxides and aryballoi, alabastra, aryballoid lekythoi, as also kylikes, minia- ture skyphoi, kotylai, bowls, lekanai, plates, amphoras etc. A Cor plastic vase in the shape of a hare was also found. The first impression is that the Cor imports span the period ca 600-575/570 BC and the Attic series follows from 560 to the end of the 6th Ct, but this remains to be verified by detailed study. Thousands of seashells of the cardiidae type, some of which had a suspension hole with silver wire. Also, a substantial num- ber of corals, with silver wires and suspension rings. Also, unburnt animal bones belonging to small animals of young age, including 32 knuckle bones, as well as a few bird bones were also noted. Most of the finds date to the 7th and 6th Ct BC, but some (e.g. most of the seated female figurines) might belong to the early 5th Ct BC. Some objects, especially pins and fibulae, can be dated to the protoGeo and Geo, but this does not necessarily mean that the construction of the temple or the establishment of the cult can be dated to that early period. A portion of the car- nelian and crystal beads dates to the BA. It is hoped that the continuation of the excavation will provide the final answer to these questions. It is premature to offer a secure identification of the divinity venerated in the sanctuary, which must be a female goddess. On the basis of the of the votives and the secondary characteristics of worship, one could suggest Hera or Aphrodite, but the pres- ent state of research does not exlude other divinities ,such as Artemis, Athena or Demeter. The finds call for a revision of the role of Ar Kythnos. The spatial distribution of the votives will allow a detailed recon- struction of ritual activity. The site is of obvious major impor- tance, considering the rarity of unplundered adyta of Greek temples; it will improve our understanding of the functions of the Ar adyton. It should also be stressed that this extraordinary site was discovered as the result of a survey. The first results of the excavation were published in the Greek press (I Thessalia, To Vima 18/12/02, Kathimerini 19/12/02, Ethnos 20/12/02), as well as in the international press and the web.

Loutra (Maroula). Ta Nea (5/11/2002) reports the discovery of a Mes settlement dated by radiocarbon X from the Demokritos laboratory to 8300-7900 BC.The settlement was aceramic. Structures could however be identified, and include one with a burial i dug into a floor. Paros Town. Excavation has finally begun on the LAr Temple of Athena (c.525 BC), a Doric temple, after a dispute lasting 35 years (Eleutherotypia 23/8/ 2002, 30). Despotiko Mantra (perhaps anc. Presperinthos). Excavation of the LGeo-Rom sanctuary here, comprising a complex of about 20 rooms, has produced numerous finds (ca 500), mainly of 7th-6th Ct BC date. These include Cor aryballoi and alabastra, terracotta fig- urines, faience, seal stones, bronze and ivory fibulae, gold objects and iron swords. Of particular interest is a dedicatory graffito to Apollo, two marble heads of 127 Ther kouroi (one dating to ca 560 BC), and a marble perirrhanterion inscribed MAPAIX ANEOEKEN. Melos Effie Photos-Jones (University of Glasgow) reports: 'In September and October 2002, a fieldwalking survey aim- ing to locate sites of industrial minerals mining and processing activity from the Cl/Rom periods took place in the SE area of the island, divided into 29 sectors. 'Mining activity' was defined as the presence of caves, tunnels or adits within the white rock, with the possible presence of mining waste (of all types) as well as pottery, as additional criteria. It soon became evident that the landscape was dotted with an abundance of rock-cut features whose variety in shape and size, in position- ing within white or other host rock, in evolving uses as places of residence for humans or animals, alive or dead (including rock-cut features in the shape of catacombs), presented a com- plex picture. As a result the project now aims to accommodate all types of rock-cut features relating to agricultural, mining, domestic or animal husbandry-based activities. Cl/Rom mining sites were identified on the basis of similarities drawn with the pottery from Agia Kyriaki and other sites of special purpose. The survey produced an unexpectedly rich level of informa- tion which now undergoes processing (including GIS). Main points are: (a) The location of an important site in the W sector of Paleochori bay, perhaps the industrial sector of the emporio at Paleochori, with possible evidence for the use of geothermal activity in the processing of industrial minerals. (b) The location of a villa site with fine wares in close proximity to a locality where five fragments of the so-called sulphur moulds, carrying the stylized ivy leaf and the initials (of the Athenians) were found. (c) The location of a further possible special purpose site previously unrecorded. (d) The abundance of obsidian scatters denoting sites dating potentially to LNeo/EBA.' Thera Akrotiri. Work proceeded under the direction of Prof. Ch. Doumas for the ASA. The excavation of over 102 deep shafts to serve as the foundations for columns for the new roof (intended to provide a controlled environment for the site) has revealed important finds of Neo, ECyc and MCyc date. Occupation at Akrotiri seems to begin in the 5th millennium BC. ECyc (EBA) finds include chamber tombs sealed by later inhabitants, and underlying MCyc (MBA) levels. Other finds include a wooden ra, Akrotiri: fresco box with a gold figurine of a goat. Some MCyc houses built over the graves seem to have been in use at the time of the great Thera eruption in the 17th Ct BC. Work also continued on the conservation of wall paintings (fig. 127), pottery (fig. 128) and bronze objects (Ergon 2001, 72-9; Kathimerini 7/12/2002; Ethnos 15/1/2003; Ta Nea 15/1/2003 and 4/4/2003) Samos The archaeological works undertaken at Samos under the direc- torship of Hermann Kienast (DAI) did not include excavations. The only noteworthy activity in the Heraion of Samos was the observation of the foundation of the Rom peripteros, which is to be published by Prof. Thekla Schulz (Regensburg). Close to Chora, the survey and mapping of underground quarries (see Kienast, AA 1992, 206-213), whose material served as building material for the first dipteros, started in co-operation with the 21st EPCA. 128 Thera, Akrotiri: bird-shaped jug 77</page><page sequence="78">78 JAMES WHITLEY 129 and 130 Archanes: Neopalatial pithoi DODEKANESE AND AMORGOS Amorgos Minoa.

Sakellaraki and I. Sakellarakis (ASA) report in Ergon 2001, 80-3 on the spectacular dis- coveries in area 33 of the Archanes palatial build- ing. A room with ashlar masonry was found packed with 33 pithoi and 145 other domestic vases such as basins and amphoras (figs 129 and 130). Some were found sealed with clay bearing a seal impression. The pithoi had been carefully placed in four rows whereas the remaining 145 vases had been set in between, thus completely obstructing access. It has been firmly confirmed that the building was destroyed by earthquake, followed by fire, which was particularly fierce due to the inflammable sub- stance (oil?) stored. During the destruction, temper- atures reached over 1000 degrees C. The excavators noted the existence of calcified textiles stored with- in pithoi (fig. 131). E. Sakellaraki and I. Sakellarakis (ASA) report on the small scale excavation conducted at the M ceme- tery of Phourni in Ergon 2002, 49-1. The purpose of the excavation was to establish the precise con- struction date of tholos tomb C and burial building 18. W of tholos tomb C a double wall had been con- structed for the protection of the tomb (Ergon, 49-50). Between the two structures a disturbed bur- ial and various depositions of vases were discovered (Ergon, 50 fig. 45). W of burial building 18 an addi- tional wall was discovered abutting and supporting the W wall of the building and associated with footed goblets (fig. 132) (Ergon, 50-1 fig. 46). In the 'area of the rocks' amongst fragmentary pottery and sarcophagi, a fragmentary sarcophagus base was found, with basketry impressions on its bottom (Ergon, 51 fig. 47). The fragmentary lid on another sar- cophagus bears traces of two incised signs, comparable to oth- ers previously found at Phoumi (Ergon, 51 fig. 48). Galatas.

Building 2 (B 2). Corridor 11, the last unexcavated space in B 2, was probably used as a staircase in the LM IB building. Underneath, we found a rich MM IIIB/LM IA deposit, with many cups, a vase with spiral decoration and two lead weights.

Processional way andplatforms: Part of a paved road with a raised causeway running along the W facade was uncovered in 2001. The latter joins a partially paved court opening (NW court) between B 2, B 3 and the facades of the N and W wings. Though the area E of B 3 is badly disturbed by cultivation, it became possible to trace the rest of its course east- and north- wards and assess its relation to built structures along it. The road, 1.3-1.5m w., runs between the SE comer of B 3 and the NW corer of the N wing. Following the course of the exterior wall of the N wing, it turns left to join another court (N court) with a plastered floor in front of the N facade of the palace. The processional way, with a partially preserved pavement, is framed by the palace wall and another wall enclosing a large built platform (11.50 x 1.7m). The exterior, E wall of B 3 serves as the back wall of the 'enclosure'. Only one large slab along the S end of the paved upper surface of the platform remains in its original position. The fill of the platform, underneath the slabs, is composed of rough stones and packed soil. A rectangular built pit (1.2 x 1.25m) at the SE corner con- tained large quantities of sherds, mostly cups. A deep, narrow channel running between the W side of the pavement of the road and the enclosure wall was also filled with many conical cups, suggesting the performance of libation rituals from the enclosure wall into the channel. A tiny clay ladle and fragment of a circular plastered offering table were also found. The platform fell out of use with the destruction of the palace in LM IA. It is interesting to note that, during the period of revival in LM IB, its function was moved to another, smaller, paved platform at the N side of the former. The new platform measured 3.1 x 2.7m (E side) and 3.1 x 2.15m (W side). It is similar in plan, with a built pit and a channel along its front side. The pit (bothros) contained black soil with carbonized organic material, plentiful animal bones, among them two large boar's tusks, much pottery (mainly cups) and the lower part of a 'snake tube'. The loose fill in front contained fragments of vases dis- persed around the pit and channel; fragments of cups with per- forated bases (rhyton-type), large, pedestalled cups (chalices), and 'snake tubes' are the most characteristic here. The platform was incorporated into the LM IB extension of the residential area of B 3 (space 1,4a), which also included space 4b, used for storing pithoi and vases. In conclusion, the function of both platforms is stressed by their association with libation rit- uals enacted along the processional way from MM IIIB/LM IA to LM IB. North court-north entrance of the north wing: As stated before, the processional way leads into a court with a plastered floor in front of the N entrance of the wing. The area is enclosed by walls along its E and N side, the E wall (with the double door) ofB 3 and the facade of the palace. Beside its main access from the processional way, B 3 also had direct access to the court across the double door, opening onto the court, which is aligned with the exterior W entrance of B 3. This feature, along with the addition a large platform at its E side, shows clearly that B 3 was rebuilt in MM IIIB/LM IA as an annex to the N wing. The plastered floor is preserved in excellent condition at the W side of the court, under the earth floor of space 4b of B 3 and the LM IB exedra. Further E, only part of the bedding of the plaster, composed of packed soil and smashed sherds, is pre- served. The plastered surface encloses, from S and W, a pro- jecting, roughly rectangular, rocky surface sloping evenly to the N. It seems that the surface of the rock had been covered, so its natural form was preserved. Cuttings into the rock along its W and S sides, and two oblong limestone blocks set across one of them, may have been sockets for the bases of wooden props supporting a wooden construction. The importance of this construction, obviously a platform or a stand, reserved for an eminent person or for exhibiting significant cult objects, is indicated by the large circular libation pit at its S side. The circle of the pit is marked by vertically placed slabs, originally sunk into the plaster of the court's floor. Due to the destruction of the plastered floor at the E side of the court, a trench was placed here to check the fill of the court. Immediately underneath the level of the plaster, a large pottery deposit was uncovered between the facade of the palace and roughly-made retaining walls. It comprises various cups and plates (deep and shallow kalathos types), other shapes are rare. Some jugs, one pithoid jar, a lamp, a clay bird's nest vase and a conical rhyton with ripple decoration are the only examples. I 131 Archanes: calcified textile stored in a pithos 132 Archanes, Phournoi: Minoan footed goblets</page><page sequence="80">80 JAMES WHITLEY They constitute evidence of a major feasting cere- mony which took place before the court was paved. The pottery dates to MM IIIB/LM IA, proving, once more, the date of the foundation of the palace. The palace facade facing the court features a perfectly symmetrical tripartite form with a middle section (w. 3.2m) and two lateral projections (3.4m each). In the W section, an entrance links the court (and the processional way) with the interior of the palace. The E doorjamb is incorporated into a pillar with wooden vertical beams in the comers, as sug- gested by rectangular holes for wooden pegs cut in the surface of the block. A (wooden?) prop was fixed in the western door-post. Its base of stone or wood left a sharp-edged rectangular oblong pit, reaching bedrock, in the floor of the court. The north wing: A rectangular structure (3.2 x 1.55m) across its entrance, to do with open-air ritu- als, is composed of a central part, slightly projecting forwards, and two built pits symmetrically arranged 133 Gor on both sides. The left pit (0.7 x 0.45m) is almost completely destroyed and its contents totally dispersed. The slightly larger (0.9 x 0.55m) and deeper right pit, however, still held some of its original contents, namely two cups, one with horn-like projections on the rim, some sherds of cups and a kalathos, as well as some animal and fish bones. Judging from the difference in elevation between the paved floor in front of the construction and the threshold of the N Entrance, there may have been stepped access to the former. Two small animal figurines were recovered here. Apparently the tripartite con- struction, which resembles the plan of the so-called 'tripartite shrine' of the villa at Vathypetro, was used as an altar for depositing offerings after entering the palace. Except for the room with the altar next to the N entrance, another seven rooms of the N wing were excavated. Among ordinary finds, a body fragment of a medium-sized animal figurine and the head of an anthropomorphic figurine with a conical hat are the most interesting. Evidence for a foundation ritual occured in room 58, where a coarse vase containing two cups was found under the floor. A trench in room 60 exposed the comer of a room with a plastered floor and a small hearth in the joint of the wall (MM IB). To the E, we exposed a 20m long section of the exterior N ashlar wall of the N wing, sharing the stepped formation of the E facade. The quality of masonry and the width of the wall (1.3m at the level of the third course) illustrate the outstanding significance of the N facade of the palace. This is also suggested by the fact that no architectural element or natural obstacle obscures visibility from afar or alters the essential formal char- acteristics. In a way, this massive and finely built wall consti- tutes the N front not only of the palace but also of the settle- ment, since there are no buildings in front of it (except the N terrace). Thus, the wall marks the Neolithic limit of the urban space and its border with the surrounding natural landscape, projecting notions of monumentality, of the palace-elite's power and prestige, over a broad area around Galatas.' Gortyna. G. Sena Chiesa and G. Bejor (University of Milano and Italian School) report on work conducted at the acropolis of Gortyna along the highest point of Ag. Ioannis hill: 'The Ar sanctuary, surrounded by large gypsum blocks, is better understood in light of comparable structures at Dreros and Prinias. The Cl period is represented by the foundations of a large building, later buried by hill slide. The Ch period is marked by the succession of at least three sacred buildings associated with a cemetery. Some of the visible structures are tyna, theatre: wall of the scenae frons in perfect alignment to the supposed Bzy building that domi- nates the hill but has never been excavated. The remains of a tower and a chapel associated with poor burials belong to a later phase'. The Italian School has also published a monograph on the sanctuary: W. Johannowsky, II Santuario Sull'Acropoli di Gortina, vol. 2. (Monografie della SAIA e delle Missioni Italiane in Oriente XVI. Athens, 2002). F. Ghedini and J. Bonetto (University of Padova and Italian School) continued the excavation along the N sector of the theatre. Removal of the collapse and destruction deposit of the stage building revealed part of the wall of the scaenae frons in situ (fig. 133). A horizontal niche located 4m above the anc. floor suggests that it belongs to the upper floor of the stage. Walls associated with the scaenae frons allow to define its ori- entation and its precise extension (23.8m). The collapsed blocks of the scaenae frons in association with its in situ sections sug- gest that an earthquake was the cause of its collapse and destruction. In the area of the theatre located S of the scaenae frons, a gate was connected this building with the area of the temple of Apollo Pithios. Pottery from levels associated with the collapse and abandonment date between the 2nd and 7th-8th Ct AD. It is suggested that the building collapsed between the 6th and 7th Ct AD during a period when Gortyna suffered from at least three destructive earthquakes. D. Manacorda and E. Zanini (Italian School) report on the excavation conducted along the so-called Byzantine quarter of anc. Gortyna located between the monumental temple of Apollo Pithios and the so-called praetorium. 'A large E/W oriented test trench (20 x 7.5m) was dug as a detailed stratigraphic excavation, to reveal the changes within this sector of the anc. town from the Geo to the Byz period, in order to link the already explored areas of the temple of Apollo and the 'praetorium'. Below a level of mod. pits were sections of the settlement, a second phase of which dates to mid 6th Ct AD. A construction of that date occupied the central part of the trench and opened to a large open-air space to the E, possibly part of the large courtyard discovered in the adjacent sector of the so called Byz houses identified W of the 'praetorium'. To the S a complicated stratigraphic sequence was revealed, possi- bly a kitchen equipped with an oven, a raised hearth and other peculiar constructions. In this area, wall collapse is possibly associated with the strong earthquakes of the second half of the 7th Ct AD, followed by abandonment. In the same area burials continued to take place whereas the final abandonment of the</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 81 district can be associated with the Arab conquest of Crete dur- ing the first half of the 9th Ct AD.' A. Di Vita (University of Macerata and Italian School) con- tinued the study of the so-called Byzantine houses in the area of the 'praetorium'. An archaeological map of the urban area of the town of Gortyna, including its necropolis was compiled, covering an area of ca 430 hectares. R. Frioli (Italian School) in collaboration with M. Borboudakis (13th EBA) excavated at the large basilica of Mitropolis with the purpose of clarifying the ground plan of the basilica. The original floor of the Tr?pactrcbov was paved with large limestone slabs similar to those in the narthex. The area N of the narthex had been used as a cemetery. Architectural sculp- ture in secondary use, inscribed slabs, fragments of glass win- dows, coins and mosaics were found. The large quantities of fragmentary slabs in the area of the narthex suggests that its walls were covered with dados.' Herakleion. The discovery of the Venetian monastery of Saint Francis at the site for the extension of the Archaeological Museum of Herakleion is reported in To Nea (8/04/2003). The monastery is one of the most important ecclesiastical monu- ments of Crete. The rescue excavation is conducted by P. Epitropakis of the 13th EBA. Keratokambos Vianou. E. Banou (23rd EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 330-1 on the discovery of two LM IIIA chamber tombs along the N slope of Trapeza hill. The first had been robbed but pottery collected is datable towards the end of LM IIIA2. The second tomb dates to LM IIIA1 and contained a plethora of finds (Kritiki Estia, 329 fig. 10 and 331 fig. 11). The tombs were presented in 2000 at the 'Knossos: Palace, City, State' conference and will be published in the forthcoming pro- ceedings. E. Banou reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 331-2 on the res- cue dig conducted at a site called Kastri, located 200m from the sea. LC1 pottery and associated finds testify the existence of a contemporary settlement, which will be further explored (Kritiki Estia, 332 fig. 12). Knossos. E. Banou (23rd EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 307-14 on the discovery of tombs at the Makromanolakis plot in Ambelokipoi. A trench dating to the German occupation was associated with the owner's house, which was the German garrison for the area during WW II. Thirteen tombs were dis- covered, dating from the Myc to the Rom period; details for each tomb are given in the report. The single BA tomb, a cist grave, dates to LM II. It contained a single burial, accompanied by a bronze spear, knife and a small squat alabastron. Two chamber tombs date to the Geo period; one was associated with four burials, the other, although robbed, revealed a fragmentary bronze buckle depicting a mounted archer in relief (Kritiki Estia, 313 fig. 2). All other tombs date to the Hel-Rom period, including a Hel rock-cut rectangular tomb containing a pair of heart-shaped silver earrings (Kritiki Estia, 310 fig. 1). Eleni Hatzaki (BSA) reports on the 2002 excavation season at the Little Palace north section: 'The objective of the 2002 season was to complete the exca- vation of the area opened during 2001. The stratigraphic sequence outlined during 2001 was confirmed and the architec- tural phasing for M and post-M occupation phases was clarified. Minoan levels. The LM IIIA1/2 white plastered courtyard opening to the N of the Little Palace M halls, discovered during the 2001 season, is flanked to the W by a raised paved area/ walkway with an ashlar kerb, itself bounded by a wall at its W. W of this is another EW ashlar wall, associated with a succes- sion of open-air surfaces, dating up to LM IIIA2. These are bor- dered at the W by the NE platform, a retaining wall for bedrock, which runs parallel to the LP W facade. This has now been traced for a further 4.5m to the N. The N and W preserved faqade sections of the substantial LM IIIB building identified in 2001 were uncovered. Partly built on top of the destroyed Little Palace, it had facades made from recycled (Little Palace?) ash- lar blocks, heavily robbed during the Geo period (N faqade) and 2nd Ct AD (W facade). The building had been largely dug away by A. Evans in the 1900s, and only its NW comer was left intact: it revealed a hearth-like installation associated with LM IIIB late pottery. The pottery is identical to that from the Unexplored Mansion N platform pits, which Popham termed LM IIIB late (M.R. Popham, The Minoan Unexplored Mansion, Oxford 1984, 184-6). It is also identical to the so-called LM IIIB late pottery from Evans' excavations at the Little Palace (M.R. Popham, 'Late Minoan IIIB pottery from Knossos' BSA 65 (1970) 195-202). However, the material is very similar to the LM IIIC pottery from Warren's Stratigraphical Museum site (P.M. Warren, 'Knossos: Stratigraphical Museum Excavations, 1978-82 part II' AR 1982-83, 69-76). The Little Palace north excavation will help clarify issues of ceramic sequence and ter- minology for the LM IIIA, LM IIIB and LM IIIC periods. The foundation of this LM IIIB building marks a turning point in the history of the site, to be associated with a new settlement. LM IIIC building remains were discovered on top of the NE plat- form; they are contemporary with the establishment of the new houses at the Stratigraphical Museum extension site. The results of the 2001 and 2002 excavation seasons will help clarify the history of the Little Palace, especially in providing more firm dating evidence for the fire destruction responsible for the preservation of its sealings and tablets. Greek levels. Gr levels were severely disturbed by subse- quent Rom building activity. A LC1 earthen floor was associat- ed with a pithos, preserved intact since it had been sunk deep into the floor. Sparse remains of EOr, Geo and protoGeo levels were also traced along the W part of the excavated area. Of sig- nificance is the identification of good Geo levels below the Rom roadway discovered last year (not excavated). Roman levels: The W end of a Rom building with at least two major building phases was excavated. Subsequent to its abandonment, followed by roof tile and wall collapse, the build- ing was severely robbed not only of its visible walls but even of its deep foundations. The heavy concentration of 2nd Ct AD rob- bing pits along the W end of the excavated area, filled with rub- ble and chipped stones, implies that further to the N there was a readily available source of building material, potentially the M building N of the Little Palace. An unexpected discovery was a much damaged female(?) head found out of context in one of these rubble-filled robbing pits (fig. 134). The head is of local poros limestone, though its style and execution suggest an artist from outside Knossos, perhaps outside Crete (Samos?). This head is of particular interest, as on stylistic grounds it clearly dates to somewhere in mid 6th Ct BC, a period that has been suggested to represent a gap in the material record of Knossos, which some have argued indicates a break in occupation. This head makes this particular hypothesis less plausible'. E. Banou (23rd EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 214-5 on the discovery of an E/W M (peribolos?) wall at Spilia, measur- ing 13.5m 1., 0.6-0.8m w. in the Athanasopoulou plot located in the Hatzidakis-Nivas area. The site is associated with MM IIIB-LM IA pottery; other finds include a bronze pin and a seal- ing with a circular motif similar to one depicted on a sealing from Zakros (CMS 11.7, no. 228).</page><page sequence="82">82 JAMES WHITLEY 134 Knossos: Archaic poros head Sara Paton (BSA) reports on the 2002 study season at the Villa Dionysos: 'Work continued on the study of the pottery from the pits dug in 1998 for the supports of the new shelters. There were two interesting finds: one was a textile impression, on some sherds from a jar of local manufacture which had apparently been bandaged to hold it in shape during air-drying. The textile impression, which was underneath the slip, was a fairly fine tabby weave with a warp(?) of ca 15 threads per cm and weft(?) of ca 35 threads per cm. J. P. Wild (Manchester University, Ancient Textile Unit) reported that there are very few textile impressions recorded from the eastern Rom provinces, and most that exist are accidental. This one is interesting because it seems to have had a purpose. The second find was a dipinto on some amphora sherds. One sherd had part of the first letter of the word, and another the ending NOIOY. Both of these finds were from the fill below the (robbed) paving of the peristyle walkway, in deposits of the mid 2nd Ct AD'. Todd Whitelaw (UCL and BSA) reports on work towards the third edition of the Knossos Survey: 'Work in the BSA archives at Athens concentrated on records of unpublished and partially published excavations at Knossos, and identifying which archival records relating to fieldwork at Knossos have been deposited with the BSA, and therefore which need to be actively sought elsewhere. Particular attention focused on the correspondence from Pendlebury and Hutchinson held in the archives. Unfortunately, the former con- vey little information about Pendlebury's excavations at Knossos, though Hutchinson's correspondence is extremely useful. At Knossos work was devoted to completing the box index of the Stratigraphical Museum, and examining material from several unpublished excavations. The former should now allow the location of material from any BSA projects stored in the Museum'. Kommos. Joseph Shaw (University of Toronto and ASCSA) reports: 'During the summer season at the project's Pitsidia study centre and storeroom, research concentrated on Neopalatial M house X located just N of the road separating the civic buildings from the town. Especially involved was J. Rutter who has been studying for some time the character and stratigraphy of the house's rich deposits ofLM I-IIIA2 pottery, including its LM II levels of occupation that are as richly represented only at Knossos and Chania. J. Shaw continued with his studies of finds from the house, including bronze and stone tools, loomweights, and other artefacts. These studies will help M. Shaw and J. Rutter to prepare the volume on house X. There has also been further clarification of pottery from outside the Mesara area. This involves identifying fabrics from other parts of Crete (e.g. Gavdos, Pediada, Chania) as well as the slow process of sorting out wares imported from outside Crete, all indicators of international maritime interchange. L.V. Watrous began the process with his publication of the LBA wares in Kommos III (1992). Rutter and A. Van de Moortel have continued this process of refinement, this year with the help of J. Moody and H. Lewis Robinson who identified W Cretan fab- rics. Also, C. Bergoffen (Institute of Fine Art, New York University) advised us about both M and LBA imports from Cyprus. Other visitors were D. Aston and B Bader (both SCIEM in Vienna), who reviewed our imported Egyptian and Canaanite wares, with the result that new shapes were identified (cups and bowls in Nile silt fabrics) along with, for the first time, vessels (lentoid flasks) from Upper rather than Lower Egypt (amphoras, lentoid flasks, and a single pot stand frag- ment in Marl fabrics)'. Phaistos. V. La Rosa (University of Catania and Italian School) reports on the excavations conducted in the area S of the large house, abutting the M staircase, which provides communication between the lower W plateia and the theatral area: 'Six MM IA building phases were defined (fig. 135). It is not accidental that following this ceramic period of intense building construction, the palace at Phaistos was built. The third architectural phase (6/1-3) is associated with a house consisting of three rooms with a N/S orientation and an entrance to the E, possibly associated with a corridor of an outdoor courtyard. The oldest house (x/2) dates to the beginning of the MM IA. The most impressive discovery was that of a large square house dating to Final Neo. Its central wall with rooms to the N and S follows an E/W orientation for ca 9m. The faces of this wall (0.75m w.), preserved up to 1.5m in h., were covered with a clay mixture, which was found exceptionally well preserved</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 83 in situ due to the fire that destroyed the building. The largest part of the building had been removed by a Hel trench, which had reached bedrock and was filled with large quantities of stones, with fragmen- tary pottery dating in range from historical to Geo. The large Neo house must have been the dwelling of important individuals and forms an alterative focal point to the contemporary circular hut identified along the S part of the later palace. At the beginning of EM I, whilst that hut continued to be used, a fill was deliberately deposited above the Neo house in order to construct a solid platform for the next build- ing. This is a construction practice associated with the foundation of the first palace, after the destruc- tion of ca 1700 BC, that is a century later. The con- struction was never completed and the fill must have remained visible for several centuries, as the area was deliberately kept open. Only at the beginning of MM IA was it partially removed for the construction of room ac/2. A nearby foundation pit contained a 135 Phai small Neo flask together with a MM IA fragmentary conical cup, possibly deliberately smashed. A monumental system of NW/SE oriented Hel terraces is associated with the organization of the town between the end of the 3rd and mid 2nd Ct BC. One wall is preserved up to 2.20m in h. The orientation of these terraces is identical to that along the quarter excavated by D. Levi in 1965-66 immediately W of the theatre courtyard. A test trench, along the E wall of the large terrace dates to the Hel period. The E end is later, possibly Rom, and must be associated with a form of a large peribolos. W of the road, two mature MM IB constructions were traced, which had not been disturbed by the Hel constructions. A small jug, deposited within a pit sunk to the bedrock repre- sents the remains of a foundation deposit.' Pitsidia. D. Hatzi-Valiannou (Archaeological Institute of Crete) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 326-30 on the 1999-2000 season at the M farmstead, the excavation of which is now complete. Work is progressing towards the construction of a shelter. Wall remains confirm that occupation at the site goes back to the Old Palace period. E Hel pottery located SE of the farmstead con- firms the extension of the Cl-Hel settlement. Finally a system of stone built dams on the Sphakoriaki stream, located NW of the site confirms the exploitation of natural resources during the M period. Smari. D. Hatzi-Valiannou (Archaeological Institute of Crete) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 315-26 on the surface survey conducted in the area of Smari. Settlements, farmsteads, sanc- tuaries, cemeteries dating to the M and historical periods were located during the survey in the vicinity of the mod. village and Profitis Elias Hill (Kritiki Estia, 315-7). An extensive report is also provided about the systematic excavations conducted on the Profitis Elias Hill acropolis. The report summarizes the discoveries made during a succession of seasons which have revealed this important BA (MM and LM IIIC) and EIA site which was abandoned towards the end of the 7th Ct BC. Syme Vianou. A. Lembesi (ASA) in Ergon 2001, 85 reports on the continued conservation of finds from the site. Two offering tables bore Linear A inscriptions. A fragment of a large human clay figurine (leg) belongs to the figurine whose feet had been found in 2000 (Ergon 2000, 103, fig. 122). A. Lembesi also reports, in Ergon 2002, 52-4, on excava- tion conducted in the area defined by the N and W wall of the stos: superimposed house phases in area southwest of Kouloures Neopalatial sacred peribolos. The excavation of levels related to outdoor ritual was completed and bedrock was reached. It was confirmed that religious activities continued after the destruction in the Neopalatial period of the upper courses of the peribolos walls, which even today are in part preserved to a maximum h. of 2.35-2.50m (Ergon, 53 fig. 50). After the par- tial destruction of the peribolos, a retaining wall was construct- ed close to the destroyed NW comer. This wall's purpose was to retain the destruction debris and level the area so that outdoor religious activities could continue. Along the NW comer, a semi-circular platform was constructed which served either as an area for the deposition of offerings or was used by an indi- vidual who directed ritual activities. In 2002 a richly-illustrated monograph was published: A. Lembesi, To Iepo6 To Eplin KOCI T r A(ppo56i TT oIrl T 1UzT1 Btdvvo) III. Toa dOXKtva avOpopn61op(paO et5cbXta. (ASA Library 225. Athens, 2002). EASTERN CRETE Agios Nikolaos. S. Apostolakou (24th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 333-4 on the discovery on the Stavros plot of many disturbed tombs associated with only few finds. Exceptional was a hut-shaped tomb which contained a single burial with two Kos-type amphoras, which had been placed upright. The most impressive find was an amphoriskos with its lid and a pair of strigils which were found attached by a ring to a bronze chain. Azoria. Donald Haggis and Margaret Mook (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Iowa State University, ASCSA) report: 'The first of five seasons of excavation at Azoria, in E Crete, was conducted in the summer of 2002, with the purpose of examining the peak of the S acropolis, an area that had been last explored in 1900 by Harriet Boyd Hawes. Twenty-two trenches were opened across the site, allowing us to begin studying the form and organization of the Ar city, its early his- tory and conditions of abandonment. While the site had been inhabited since the Final Neo period, it reached a size of at least 6ha by the EIA (LM IIIC-protoGeo), and was occupied contin- uously down to the first quarter of the 6th Ct BC. During the 6th Ct BC the settlement expanded to its maximum size, perhaps as</page><page sequence="84">84 JAMES WHITLEY large as 15ha. The city was substantially redesigned and rebuilt in the E 6th Ct BC. Evidence of planning consists of a series of roughly concentric 'spine walls' which were used to organize and segregate space as well as direct communication routes through the settlement. The uppermost spine wall on the peak of the S acropolis forms a massive architectural terrace that runs along the natural bedrock contour, both supporting the build- ings up-slope from the wall and forming the back wall of struc- tures on the terrace below. Houses on both sides of the wall were excavated in 2002, revealing interesting variations in design: simple three-room axial plans are found alongside com- plex square corridor houses, suggesting social stratification and functional differentiation of households. One fascinating discovery this season was a large civic building - a dining, food-processing, and storage complex on the W slope of the S acropolis - which is both functionally dis- tinctive and architecturally separate from the domestic units so far excavated. We uncovered only a single room of the dining structure this season. This room, about 30m2 in area (about 6.5m w.), has a clay floor and a single round column-base of hewn limestone which was set slightly off-centre of the door- way which leads through a cross wall of smallish boulders; the doorway itself is over 1.10m. w. On the floor were found frag- ments of three large terracotta stands, two of which are fenes- trated. One stand has a torus moulding with red-painted triglyph and metopal sections, while a lower register has alter- nating black and white sections. A fourth fenestrated stand was found in an adjoining storeroom. These stands were designed to support large kraters and probably formed the centrepieces in drinking and dining ceremonies. Given the unusual size, archi- tecture, and assemblage of this room, we think that it forms part of an andreion which was the context for the syssitia or com- mon mess of the urban elite (Strabo 10.480). One of the adjoining storerooms of the complex contained at least seven large pithoi, some decorated with elaborate relief work characteristic of Cretan storage jars: heraldic birds, foliate bands, rosettes, a variety of guilloches, interlocking spirals, and shield bosses, among others. One pithos had a bull's head pro- tome. Seed remains from the floor of the storeroom were well preserved in the penultimate burnt destruction of the city at the end of the 6th Ct (a burning horizon that is visible across the site); both grapes and olives are indications of the contents of some of the pithoi. Clues to the elite citizenry's diet are also provided by two kitchens within the complex. The southernmost kitchen was filled with food debris, fragments of numerous cups, pithoi, and a whole hydria found smashed on its side. The food debris, including olive pits, concentrations of limpet and top shells, and an extraordinary array of animal bones (sheep, goat, pig, agri- mi, cow, hare, fish, sea urchin, crab) is not taken to be primary food preparation material from the kitchen itself, but rather a midden created in the room after its abandonment. That is to say, the condition of the material in the S kitchen suggests a garbage heap, discarded debris from both food preparation and consumption associated with the andreion. Part of a bronze helmet was discovered in one of the stor- age rooms in the complex, a fragment of the distinctly high crest that belongs to an open-faced Cretan type, known in only one other full-sized example from Aphrati (now in the Museum fur Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg). Rows of incised lotus chains, guilloche, and wave patterns decorate the surface of the Azoria piece'. Gournia. Vance Watrous and Harriet Blitzer (State University of New York Buffalo, ASCSA) report on the 2002 study season: 'Study of materials and publication preparation for the Gouria Project was carried out in three separate sessions in 2002. Watrous worked on the site and pottery records, Blitzer studied LNeo through BA, and Ot chipped stone, and began confirmation of local chronology and ware types of the post- Rom survey finds, one of the largest in the Goumia survey col- lection. This sequence from 6th through 20th Ct AD is the only identified collection of its kind in Crete, and has been verified against the ceramic deposits in Corinth, Athens, and Constantinople and the Marmara-Thrace region. Ancient land use patterns hypothesized from site location, size and availabil- ity of resources were checked against moder land use patterns and historical records (Vikelaia Archive, Herakleion). Ierapetra (anc. Ierapitna). S. Apostolakou (24th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 334-45 on the extensive rescue excavations at Vigla ahead of the town's extension towards N and W. On the Siganos plot, located at the centre of anc. lerapitna, a 3-3.2m wide paved road with adjoining sewage pipe was traced for 12m. The badly-preserved remains of a building were traced, associated with five pointed-base storage vessels in situ (Kritiki Estia, 335-6 fig. 2). In the Pangalos plot, Rom building remains were discov- ered, dated by associated lamps to the 2nd Ct AD (trench A); in trench B part of a stone-built tomb with poor offerings was revealed (Kritiki Estia, 339 fig. 4); whereas trench F revealed part of a Rom building. In 1999, excavation was completed and revealed that the Rom building of trench r had a paved floor, but the best-preserved sector was to the W (Kritiki Estia, 340 fig. 5); outside and W of the building in an open-air area a n-shaped built hearth was associated with large quantities of domestic pottery and other finds. A separate building was traced at the E end of the plot, whereas at a lower level walls of an ear- lier structure were revealed. The different buildings discovered date between the 1St and 3rd Ct AD. In the Dedeledtai-Perantonaki plot, located along the old Ierapetra-Gra Lygia road, rubble built building remains were discovered (Kritiki Estia, 341). For the Paramythas site, S. Apostolakou reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 342 on the discovery of further sectors of the cemetery of anc. Ierapitna at the Ierapetra high-school plot. Although pottery was collected, only one built tomb was dis- covered, containing two burials (Kritiki Estia 343 fig. 7). No burial offerings were associated with the interments. On the nearby Tsolakaki plot, a badly-preserved wall, and cover tiles associated with tombs, which had been thoroughly destroyed, were discovered (Kritiki Estia 343). For the Alykies site, S. Apostolakou reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 344-5 on the discovery of a built construction, probably used as a well at the Sareidaki plot. Badly-preserved wall remains were traced at the N end of the plot, associated with tesserae and in situ fragments of a mosaic floor surface. For the Almyros site, S. Apostolakou reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 344-5 on the discovery of a built drain running E-W which was traced for 20m in the Machaira field (Kritiki Estia 344 fig. 8). Karphi. Saro Wallace (BSA) reports: 'A programme of archaeological recording was initiated at Karphi, Lasithi, more than 60 years after the excavations of J. Pendlebury, in order to assess the condition of the exposed excavated architecture and to develop strategies for future research and management. Four buildings or building complex- es (the 'priest's house', 'megarons', 'great house' and rooms 113-114, 120-121) were recorded, improving the published plans, to show the extent of stone tumble and of vegetation</page><page sequence="85">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 85 establishment since the excavation. A detailed topographical plan was made of the entire excavated area for the first time. A condition survey was carried out on the four named buildings and partly extended to the rest of the excavated architecture. A full condition survey and photographic monitoring of the site are planned in the course of the next several years. The project also incorporated interviews with locals and visitors to establish perceptions of and reasons for visiting the site, and a trial mon- itoring of visitor numbers over a 15-day period, in the interest of assessing the need for, and the potential impact of, possible research and management strategies'. Kavousi. S. Apostolakou (24th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 342 on the discovery of a Geo burial pithos found asso- ciated with sparse skeletal material but no burial offerings. Palaikastro. Hugh Sackett, Alexander MacGillivray and Jan Driessen (BSA) report on the 2002 study season: 'The building 1 (M temple) study was completed by MacGillivray and T. Cunningham, who worked through the extremely complex stratigraphy to finalize the history of this sacred structure, built and rebuilt as a succession of sacred buildings during Crete's turbulent LM I, LM II and LM III peri- ods, from roughly 1550 to 1200 BC. The building 5 (Kouros shrine) study was continued by I. Jeanmart, who completed the work on rooms 6 to 11, 19 and 21. Conservation, inventory and drawing continued to reveal inter- esting pottery. Two separate burning phases within the LM IB period were observed. The effects of these fires can be readily seen on the restored pottery. Some unusual forms and styles were found during conservation, for example the unique band- ed design of a double-axe which is gradually transformed by the painter into a lily - a premonition of the cartoon strip. C. Macdonald continued his study of building 4 and super- vised the mending of the whole vases found in the W and SW apothekes in that LM building. The great deposits of whole vases deposited during what we read as a seismic event pro- duced forms in the local 'blot and trickle' style with imported coarse ware stirrup-jars, and other forms which will allow us to link this event historically with other Cretan centres during the LM IIIA2 period. The Centenary of British excavations at Palaikastro was celebrated with a grand ceremony at the village school on July 7. The celebrations inaugurated the BSA's retro- spective photographic exhibit designed by Holly Parton and Madga Terzidou with Amalia Kakikis.' Praisos. James Whitley (University of Cardiff, BSA) reports on the 2002 study season: 'Work concentrated on material picked up in 1993, though some tracts covered in 1994 were also included (tracts 1-399), concentrating in particular on the tracts of the 'refuge settle- ment' at Kypia above Kalamafki (site 40, tracts 78-95), and some material from sites 1-6. In view of our improved under- standing of the ceramic chronology and of improvements in data recording, it was decided to re-study some material. The reference collection of Ar to Hel sherds established in the 1999 and 2000 study seasons was used to date the finds. Re-study of the material from the refuge settlement in par- ticular (site 40) proved fruitful. Deep bowl fragments from in and around the large structure on the top of hill 1 (site 40.1) proved on examination to have good general parallels with phase II at Kavousi Kastro, and particularly close parallels with material from Palaikastro, Kastri. The presence of button-hook spirals on two sherds, and one lozenge-and-loop chain on another, allows us to date this structure to the very beginning of LM IIIC. The coarse wares cannot be so precisely dated, though good parallels for many of the forms found on hill 1 (sites 40.1 and 40.2) can be found in phases II and III at Kavousi Kastro. Later material from hills 1 and 2 (sites 40.1, 40.2 and 40.3) proved elusive, and it seems that the only material that can be plausibly dated as late as protoGeo is confined to hill 3 (site 40.4). One curious outcome of our re-study is that some mate- rial from this site must date to sometime in the Ar to Cl period, including a terracotta plaque and what seems to be an architec- tural terracotta.' Zakros. L. Platon (ASA) reports on the continued study and con- servation of excavation material in Ergon 2001, 84-5. Some site conservation also took place at the Palace (Ergon, 85, fig. 93). WESTERN CRETE Apodoulou. L. Godart (University of Napoli and Italian School) and I. Tzedakis (Honorary General Director of Antiquities) report on the continued excavations at the palace. New parts of the building were revealed and a road leading to the town was identified. N. Karamaliki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 305-6 on the small-scale excavation conducted in the Foundoulakis field at the Mandres site. The field is located some 500m S of the archaeological site. Four Rom tombs were excavated; they were empty of finds. The funerary stele depict- ing a male figure, now at Rethimnon Museum came from the same cemetery and dates to the end of the 3rd Ct AD. Aptera. B. Ninou-Kindeli (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 252-8 on restoration and site management work. The large F-shaped cistern was cleaned of centuries of silt and revealed that it was mostly stone-built and founded on bedrock following the system of opus caementicum. The triple-vaulted cistern was also cleared of lm of silt. Excavation and consoli- dation took place at bath houses I and II. Restoration work took place at Agios Ioannis Theologos monastery. Finally, the stone- paved path and the Med path were cleared of vegetation and repaired. Part of an anc. road constructed from large slabs was revealed. Part of a heroon was aslo uncovered. Between two rows of robbed tombs, five pillar bases were found, four of which bore inscriptions. One of the inscriptions is intact and reads: H nlOAlI / HPA5IOXON / OIAETAIPOY / HPQA. On a comer block belonging to a sixth pillar base was recorded: AIMIAION / XAPIAHMON / HPQA. The inscriptions date to the 1SL2nd Ct AD. Between the pillars, superimposed layers of ritual pyres from the end of the 1st Ct AD to the beginning of the 2nd Ct AD were discovered in a well-stratified sequence. Together with the burnt remains of liquid offerings, attested by the presence of numerous vessels suitable for containing liquids, were found carbonized olives and almonds. Numerous Hel lamps from the 2nd and 1st Ct BC, found in a pit, suggest an earlier but compa- rable hero cult. The presence of many collapsed architectural elements, together with the stepped foundation of a building with one column base in situ, suggests the existence of a funer- ary monument associated with the heroon. Among the collapsed building debris, a relief sculpture depicting a male and a female figure was found. The form is known in funerary buildings of the E imperial period. It is an unusually well constructed piece of work, for Cretan standards, and dates to the reign of Trajan. Axos. E. Tegou (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 294-5 on the discovery of a Rom tomb located at the Kamaritis field at the Amoudara site. The badly-preserved burial was</page><page sequence="86">86 JAMES WHITLEY accompanied by a bronze coin from Knossos bearing the names of Claudius and Messalina. At the Ellinospita site a Geo clay figurine of a horse was discovered. Chamalevri. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 272-4 on various rescue excavations con- ducted in six different fields. In the Starvoulakis field three building phases dated from MM II to LM IIIA, with a wealth of finds. In the Sampiri-Vasiliadi field a lOm-long wall associated with an open-air space was excavated. Conical cups, loomweights, fragmentary stone vases and obsidian blades were among the finds. In the Kallergi field, located at the S part of Kakavella hill where the MM II to LM IIIB settlement is locat- ed, anc. remains were severely destroyed by a bulldozer. In the Dradaki field Hel building remains were excavated. E. Tegou (25th EPCA) in Kritiki Estia (2002) 275 reports on the discovery of Hel building remains in the Agathangelou plot. The building's staircase was excavated. Chania, Minoan necropolis. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 233 on the excavation of two LM IIIA/B chamber tombs in the Spiridakis plot. A length of only 8.75m of the much longer dromos, obviously belonging to a tomb of impressive dimensions, was excavated. A second chamber tomb was found robbed (Kritiki Estia, 234 fig. 1). It contained two burials associated with LM IIIB, which included an octopus stirrup jar (Kritiki Estia, 234 fig. 2) and a conical cup, small stone beads, one of gold and bronze tweezers. Classical settlement and necropolis. M. Andreadaki- Vlazaki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 234-3 on the extensive rescue excavations conducted in the area of the C town. Burials were found in Tzanakis street in an area where the E cemetery of Cl Kydonia was located: 36 individuals were dis- covered in a series of cuttings in the bedrock, set in rows con- taining between 4-15 individuals each. The total number of individuals buried is much larger, since the cemetery extends beyond the excavated area. The burials were accompanied by grave goods including oinochoai, small single-handled skyphoi and perfume bottles from the EHel period. Study of the human bones identified only male individuals, mainly 25-35 years old; only one was younger than 18. Communal burials suggest war or a deadly disease as the cause of death, and the former seems more likely, possibly one of the civil wars of the Hel period. The continued use of the cemetery is attested by five poor- ly-constructed Rom tombs. To the LRom or ECh period dates a cross-shaped construction and peribolos which had destroyed part of the communal Hel burials. This was covered by a pyre associated with several vases. Three Rom built chamber tombs were identified nearby, but it was only possible to excavate two. Burial goods were found deposited near the burials along benches but also in small sized side-cuttings. Glass vessels, bronze coins, clay lamps and other types of pottery in addition to small quantities of jewellery, a bronze mirror and a bone comb were also found. About 100m to the W building remains dating to the Hel period were discovered, implying that some distance was kept between the cemetery and the settlement. The Hel building was sealed by its collapsed tiled roof and revealed quantities of pot- tery, coins, bronze small finds, loomweights and fragmentary stone vases. The building seems to have been repaired twice within the Hel period and once during the Rom period. During the latter phase, one of the rooms became a courtyard and acquired a well. At least some of the rooms may have been used for workshop activities. Two floors and two pits dating to 2000 BC located E of the Hel building testify that this area was occu- pied during the PH period. W of the Hel building, rubbish pits had been cut into bedrock and further to the W another Rom building was dis- covered. It was probably a workshop, since its three superim- posed floors bore strong burning marks. Below this building an ECh pit was discovered. Further to the W, at the junction of Chiotakis street, part of a Rom building, which continued to be used until the ECh period was revealed. It was equipped with a marble column and adorned with a relief sculpture depicting animal scenes. EM and MM pottery was collected from the area. S. Markoulaki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 244-5 on the extensive rescue excavations at the Mayrigiannaki plot which revealed anc. remains dating from Cl, Hel, Rom and Ot periods. A rectangular pit dating to the C1 period was filled with superimposed pyres, possibly to be asso- ciated with a nearby sanctuary located towards the comer of Peiraeus and Mitropoliti Kyrillou Street. In another part of the plot remains of a LC1 wine-pressing installation were discov- ered. Further workshop areas, associated with kilns, date to the Hel period. Burnt remains, possibly of shelves to store pottery, as well as metal hinges used for repairing large vessels were found. Near the kiln was a storage space and a separate area full of ceramic wasters and discards. To the Rom period date the partly-excavated remains of a large building with two rooms equipped with pebble mosaic floors and a third one with proper opus tessellatum decorated with geometric and circular motifs and a rectangular central panel depicting birds and laurel wreaths in colour. The build- ing's construction dates to the 2nd Ct AD; use continued until the 4th Ct AD. Throughout the plot, trenches dating to the Ot siege of Chania were found, behind them a kitchen equipped with hearths and Islamic pottery. Ot pipes and pistol bullets were also found. The site is located opposite the gun rampart of Agios Demetrios, known from literary sources, such as Merian, to have been one of the Ot military camps during the 1645 siege of Chania. In a sewage drain at Venizelos and Archondaki Street, S. Markoulaki reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 245 on the discovery of a Rom building with mosaic floors. Part of the same complex had been discovered several years ago on the corer of the two main streets of mod. Chania. On the Dagadaki plot, Peridou and Ipsilandon Street, S. Markoulaki reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 246-9 extensive res- cue excavations which have revealed sections of the religious and civic centre of anc. Kydonia, at least for the Rom period. Part of a large, possibly civic, Rom building was excavated and given a terminus ante quem around mid 3rd Ct AD. Sections of the Ot cemetery were revealed, where burials were in wooden coffins set into simple pits and tomb finds were poor. Mandrambazaki plot. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 249-50 on the rescue excavation conducted at the site where the C1 necropolis of Kydonia was located. Rectangular cist tombs, consisting of monolithic lamakes covered by slabs, and hut-graves were found. Other graves were simple cist tombs. Important was the discovery of a MM mud-brick wall running NW-SE associated with a partly preserved earth floor. It is the first time that evi- dence in support of occupation in that period is attested in the area. Eleutherna. In Kritiki Estia (2002, 275-92), P.G. Themelis (University of Crete) gives an extensive excavation report on further work conducted at the Rom building (area 2: house 2) discovered in 1967 and located close to the Hel terrace of area 2. The report is accompanied by ground plans and illustrations of finds (including marble sculpture). A monograph has been</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2002-2003 87 published: P.G. Themelis, ApXaia EXe0iepva. AvaTotKuco Togicaq (Athens, ARF, 2002). To Vima (9/12/2002) reports on the excavations conducted at the anc. town of Eleuthera by N. Stambolides (University of Crete) in preparation for the construction of an acre-large shel- ter above the anc. necropolis. Sculpted pieces 30-40cm h. depicting four warriors were discovered built into drystone walls. Stambolides suggests that these originally belonged to the 700-655 BC cenotaph already discovered at the centre of the necropolis. The statues are headless but in one case a helmet was partly reconstructed from 16 small fragments: its plume was decorated with square motifs. Other important discoveries were made: architectural frag- ments dating to the Geo period (9th-7th Ct BC), daedalic sculp- ture (700-620 BC), fragmentary legs of a poros limestone sculpture, a daedalic head from an architectural sculpture (630-620 BC), a unique head depicting a bearded male wearing an Egyptian-style wig, the legs of an Egyptianizing feline or sphinx. Other finds found in archaeological levels or incorpo- rated into drystone walls include 1.80-2m high funerary stelai and a phoenicean cippus, indicating contacts between Eleuthera and Phonecia. In addition, new burials were discov- ered: seven in 1.5-1.8m high pithoi; four in smaller pithoi (0.6m h.), presumably of infants, one of which dates to LGeo and included a bird-shaped askos, a type of burial gift better known from the Myc period. Other finds included pottery, gold jewellery, weapons and an eight-figured Gordyon-type buckle. Important is the discovery of a male clay figurine dating to 680-700 BC. In the lower levels there were many obsidian blades, fragmentary M vases, ivory pyxides lids depicting crouching animals, and wheelmade figurines dating to the M, Geo and Ar periods. Kisamos. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 266-71 on the rescue excavations conduct- ed in ten plots located in various parts of Kastelli Kisamou. In the Stimadoraki plot, part of a Rom building (3rd-4th Ct AD) was excavated, equipped with seven drains, a cistern and a well. A circular construction associated with a pithos along the S part of the plot dates to the LM period. In the Papadakis- Katakis plot, the base of a circular construction was discovered; devoid of pottery it resembles local watermills. In the Koutsounakis plot poorly-preserved building remains from the 3rd Ct AD were revealed. In the Paterakis plot, occupation phas- es dating from the 1st to 4th Ct AD were discovered, associated in the 3rd to 4th Ct AD with workshop installations. During the ECh period the area became a cemetery. In the Rokakis plot Rom building remains had been severely damaged before exca- vation. In Vardandoni street a well-constructed drain was revealed, probably associated with the antiquities discovered at the nearby Health Centre. In the Fotaki-Chairetaki plot, Rom building remains with five architectural phases were revealed. The best-preserved phase dates from mid 3rd to mid 4th Ct AD. Two skeletons were found in the basement room of the build- ing, probably the result of the destructive 365 AD earthquake which severely damaged anc. Kissamos. This basement room also contained 67 clay vessels (amphoras, oinochoe, kalathoi, lamps) and other finds. Two hoards of bronze coins date the construction phases of the building to the mid 3rd and mid 4th Ct AD. S. Markoulaki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 270-1 on further excavations in the Rom villa discovered at the Health Centre plot. In the S and East, more rooms of the villa were excavated, including a kitchen and a private bath. The badly-preserved anc. road remains suggest that the villa occu- pied almost an entire insula. As discovered in other parts of the town, open-air kitchens and ovens for baking bread had been constructed after the destructive earthquake, estimated to have reached grade 10 on the Richter scale. Anc. sources record that the earthquake took place in the summer. Melidoni. N. Karamaliki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 292-3 on the excavation of a small LM III chamber tomb at the Gerarhakis field, located at the Kofinas hill. It con- tained ten vases, most of which were found deposited around a larax and included a stirrup jar (Kritiki Estia, 294 fig. 12), amphora, conical cup, incense burner, champagne cup, kylix, kalathos, beaked jug. Other finds included a bronze knife. Neos Kournas (Kavros). N. Karamaliki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 259-62 on the rescue excavation at the Traitorakis plot. At a 100m distance to the E, remains of a Rom bath have been discovered. Building remains with three con- struction phases were revealed, the best preserved dates between the 1St and the beginning of the 2nd Ct AD, the latest phase is associated with late 3rd- early 4th Ct AD pottery. The building remains are badly preserved, so the original plan and function are difficult to ascertain (Kritiki Estia, 262 fig. 5). Pantanassa. E. Tegou (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 304-5 on the rescue excavation conducted in the Politakis field at the Erimoklisies site, located along the NE slopes of Veni. In 1995 a small tholos tomb had been excavat- ed; the 1998 season revealed a pithos burial set within a shallow pit and associated with protoGeo pottery. A N/S oriented wall was associated with remains of a pyre further to the E. Amongst the surface finds was part of a poros funerary stele depicting a bird; other decorative motifs include spirals and zigzags. Patsos. V. Ninou-Kindeli (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 301-6 on the 2000 excavation conducted at the sanctu- ary of Hermes (Kritiki Estia, 301 fig. 15 and 302 fig. 16). Extensive undisturbed levels were associated with the cult activities performed at the sanctuary. Apart from large quanti- ties of finds such as pottery and figurines, vital data regarding pre-Ch cult activities were collected. (a) The excavation of Hel and Rom cult deposits was completed; predominant for the Hel period are small cups, whereas lamps are most common amongst the Rom pottery. (b) In the area of the rock-shelter, a thick sacrificial and offering layer was excavated, dating main- ly to the Ar period. Once the deposits were removed, bedrock cut into two platforms at different levels was revealed. (c) In the central area of the shrine, M levels were excavated; they were predominantly associated with a succession of pyres and offer- ings on poorly-constructed terraces (the sanctuary contained no cult structures in any other period of its history). Further Ar and Hel pyres were discovered, each associated with important offerings. Pera Galinoi. E. Banou (23rd EPCA) and E. Tsivilika report in Kritiki Estia (2002) 295-8 on the continued excavations on the peak of Kefali Soudas hill. An impressive building has been excavated with at lest 10 rooms/areas. Room 2 is large and paved, but at a lower level has a basement, half of which was excavated. The basement is associated with large quantities of carbonized remains but only a few conical cups dating to MM IIB-IIIA and a circular stone object, possibly a pithos lid. Room 3 can be identified with a lustral basin (Kritiki Estia, 297 fig. 13) which preserved traces of its wooden staircase; only two upside-down conical cups were found on the floor. Room 6 is equipped with an earthen bench covered with plaster; conical cups were found on the paved floor and on the bench. Room 7</page><page sequence="88">88 JAMES WHITLEY 136 Sybrita: fragmentary foot from a large Roman bronze statue was cleaned and revealed that the staircase is 1.90m long. Room 8 revealed a staircase of smaller scale associated with conical cups and single-handled cups with grooves comparable to Knossian MM IIIA examples, cooking vessels, large quantities of carbon, many animal bones, horns of agrimia and very small sheets of gold. It is possible that this staircase predates that in room 7 and may have gone out of use at an earlier phase. Excavation E of room 9 revealed a narrow corridor, room 12, the walls of which are preserved in part up to 2. lm. Within the room's fill, a fragmentary rhyton, conical cups and two stone offering tables were found (Kritiki Estia, 297 fig. 14). Psathi. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 250-2 on the small-scale excavation conducted in the Theodrogiorgaki plot located on Psathi hill in the munici- pality of Nea Kydonia. Deep ploughing had destroyed MM building remains. Part of a Prepalatial building with three con- struction phases was revealed (Kritiki Estia, 251 fig. 11). An almost triangular space was used for workshop activities; the floors of the building were either paved or earthen. Good quan- tities of clay vases and numerous sherds were collected. excavation continued in the area explored during 2000: here remains of a large LGeo construction designed for the storage of goods was exposed. Finally, on the S plateau the excavation of building A2 continued; it was covered by levels dating to the 3rd Ct BC. Within this level, a fragmentary leg of a large impe- rial Rom bronze statue was discovered (fig. 136). Tsikaniana. B. Ninou-Kindeli (25th EPCA) reports in Kritiki Estia (2002) 263-6 on the rural sanctuary dated to the 4th and 3rd Ct BC. Offerings were placed directly on bedrock, without the addition of any built construction apart from the occasional use of slabs. Bull figurines were numerous and included an inscribed example which confirms that Poseidon was wor- shiped at this shrine. Pottery, mainly small vessels which could contain liquids, was found in lesser quantities than the animal figurines (Kritiki Estia, 264 fig. 15). The area surrounding the altar was also explored, here the remains of ash and small bones were found. In the immediate vicinity of the mod. church was a stone measuring 0.60 x 0.8m, and next to it a terracotta head of a bull, almost life-sized, with very realistic depiction of the ani- mal's fur. The excavators suggest that it might have been origi- nally deposited upon the large stone. Below it, and within a nat- ural cavity, bull figurines and EHel plain one-handled skyphoi had been deposited (Kritiki Estia, 264 fig. 16). Over 1,000 fig- urines have been collected from the sanctuary. Remarkably, they all belong to one type of figurine. JAMES WHITLEY British School at Athens SOURCES OF ILLUSTRATIONS ARF (TAP) ASA (B.
