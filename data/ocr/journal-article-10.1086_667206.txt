Pp. xvþ372, illustrations. $50.00. Two recent publications by art historians—one on the tomb and one on Buddhist nirvana imagery—provide an opportunity to reflect on developments in the study of premodern concepts of death and its aftermath in China. The two books offer new insights and perspectives based on a dazzling range of visual evidence. But both are concerned with beliefs and practices, not beauty or aesthetics. There is a shared focus on built space—whole tombs or Buddhist cave temples, their adornment and furnish- ings—as complete complexes of intentionality. The testimony of texts is fundamen- tal: these include transmitted texts such as the Classic of Rites (Li ji), dynastic histo- ries, or Buddhist sutras and hagiography; poetry, fiction, and other literary works; and excavated manuscripts and dedicatory inscriptions. For all those with a fascination in the reconstruction of premodern ways of thinking, the two publications offer a bounty of compelling arguments and, not surprisingly, unresolved questions for future inves- tigation. In The Art of the Yellow Springs, Wu Hung argues that past scholarship has yet to “achieve a genuine understanding of the art and architecture of Chinese tombs” (14). His concern is with the way art history isolates objects from tombs as individual works of aesthetic appreciation rather than examining objects as part of a whole and complete mortuary complex, or the way standard architectural terminology is applied to details in a tomb even though architectural forms are transformed, even reversed, underground. Similarly, Wu is critical of the tendency to collapse mingqi (spirit arti- cles made especially for burial) with objects made for use by the living—a crucial misunderstanding of different purposes, meanings, and ways of viewing objects found in tombs.

The method selected is to uncover the “fundamental logic of traditional Chinese tombs” not through the analysis of complete “representative” tombs but by addressing the “three most essential aspects of any manufactured work—spatiality, materiality, and temporality” (Wu, 219 and 14). It should be made clear that Wu very much appreci- ates focused studies of complete tombs but in this book “intends to push this kind of scholarship to the next level by making interpretative methods the direct subject of consideration” (14). In chapter 1, “Spatiality,” Wu begins with the tomb as a “vacuum” filled first by a casket and later by a houselike chamber, a development that he argues transformed the land of the Yellow Springs—“the final destination of all mortal human beings after death” (7)—from a realm completely cut off from the living to one accessible through a door and passageway (26). Furthermore, the adoption of the chamber tomb type is “associated” with four crucial changes from the late Eastern Zhou to the Han dynasties: first, the shift of the ritual of ancestral worship from the lineage temple to the tomb; second, the collapse of the distinction between the po (earthly soul) and hun (heavenly soul); third, the ascendance of the concept of “postmortem immortal- ity”; and fourth, the development of a pantheon of deities in charge of an underground bureaucracy (Wu, 32–33). The chamber tomb, according to Wu, soon became the site of a tripartite universe expressed as three large systems of visual representation: a cosmic environment, an immortal paradise, and a “happy home” in the tomb. The systems are found in most instances (as in the example of Jiuquan Dingjiazha Tomb 5) as separate parallel set- tings for the deceased with little logical connection, what the author terms a “polycen- tric” tomb (Wu, 35). Rather than the development of a “systematic theological inter- pretation,” Wu finds a “general synthetic tendency” that provided the deceased with a variety of options, visually and spatially speaking, for the afterlife (62–63). Interestingly, Wu also observes that Chinese tombs do not actually depict the underground Yellow Springs or the associated netherworld bureaucracy with its threats of judgment and punishment. Such understandings of the underworld appear to have been scrupulously suppressed in favor of the goal of providing “comfort and security” in the tomb. Wu further argues that this “fantasy world” of the tomb was a “pictorial universe inserted into the land of the Yellow Springs” (35). Historians of religion who have studied land contracts (to document ownership of the space of the tomb), grave quelling scripts or tomb ordinances, and inscribed jars containing small lead figures (surrogates for the deceased; Wu, illustration no. 119) will wish to con- sider the implications ofWu’s argument. The author also suggests that the “soul” in Chinese tombs was represented first through an empty place as a “spirit seat” and later in posthumous portraiture on tomb walls. Wu explains the emergence of the portrait of the deceased in Eastern Han dynasty tombs as an “alternative method,” which never replaced representing the deceased as an invisible presence on a “spirit seat” (68). An early tomb type with a spirit seat in the front chamber gradually gave way to a type with a painted portrait added in the rear chamber that changed in the sixth century to a single portrait near the coffin on the back wall of single chamber tombs. Wu attributes these changes in </page> <page sequence="3"> History of Religions 175 the tomb to new concepts of the body and soul of the deceased—namely, that the posthumous soul was no longer detached from the physical body of the dead and no longer needed its own focal point of worship (77). In chapter 2, “Materiality,” the author turns to the mortuary contents of Chinese tombs as “inseparable from mortuary architecture and decoration” (Wu, 85). Major types of mortuary goods are explained, including pottery and bronze spirit articles and tomb figurines, as well as the corpse and its preservation and transformation. The corpse is considered in terms of two contrasting goals: preservation, as in the elaborately wrapped body of Lady Dai at Mawangdui, or transformation, as in the jade bodies of Prince Liu Sheng and his wife Dou Wan at Mancheng (Wu, 126–38). Wu places their jade suits in a long history of jade as linked to immortality and per- suasively argues that the jade suits of the royal couple were meant not to preserve their flesh but to be their new and indestructible bodies. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the transformation and restoration of the cremated corpse. Important to the Buddhist monastic community over many cen- turies, cremation transformed an impermanent body into the indestructible essence of relics. But cremation was not widely adopted in China until the Song dynasty when the corpse in the tomb might be replaced with cremated remains in “ash urns.” An imaginative variant on the interment of ashes was the placement of cremated remains inside manikins in the Liao dynasty tomb of ZhangWenzao and his wife at Xuanhua, Hebei province. Wu endorses the argument of Hsueh-man Shen that the ash-imbued manikins served to reconstitute the bodies of the deceased. The reconstitution of cor- poreality accommodated the Confucian requirement for a body to which rituals for the deceased might be directed. The practice is also reminiscent of the incorporation of cremated ashes into the statues of Buddhist monastics, either mixed into the mate- rials or placed in an opening inside the sculpture. And Wu finds the use of cypress wood in some manikins to be evidence of a connection to the Daoist practice of mak- ing cypress figures as substitutes for people (145). Wu follows Shen again in finding the Zhang family tomb to be indicative of a syncretic accommodation of Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist religious beliefs. Chapter 3, “Temporality,” approaches the tomb as a “spatial-temporal construct” from the perspective of three types of time: cosmic/mythic time, lived time, and his- torical time. Cosmic/mythic time includes correlative patterns of the universe such as the representations of the five elements, cosmic deities, and symbols, as well as celes- tial charts (tian tu; Wu, 151–53). Wu then returns to the group of Liao dynasty Zhang family tombs to trace the evolution of their ceiling designs from well-known earlier types to the intriguing adoption of the twelve Babylonian zodiac signs in sinicized form to the synthesis of Chinese and foreign elements (160–63). The second type of temporality, “lived time,” is exemplified by “lived objects,” or objects used by the deceased and subsequently buried in the tomb. Such objects are found in the tomb near the body of the deceased or around the “spirit seat” of the post- humous soul. Wu astutely suggests that lived objects such as these constitute a split temporality between an association with the past—the previous life of the deceased— and the ongoing existence of the soul in the tomb (172–73). In the third and largest category of temporality—“historical time”—Wu argues that retrospective biographies—carved on epitaph stones placed in tombs beginning </page> <page sequence="4"> 176 Book Reviews in the third and fourth centuries CE—and pictorial retrospective biographies share the same narrative structure (176). Similarly, the author draws a parallel in narrative structure between the stone epitaph of NingMao, a NorthernWei official, and the pic- torial depiction of Ning’s biography on the official’s sarcophagus (Wu, 177–79). For Wu, the vocabulary of texts and literary forms is fundamental to interpreting the visual narratives of tombs. The author then turns to the subject of four ancient paragons of filial piety depicted on Ning Mao’s sarcophagus. Although each lived in a different historical period, their “shared virtue transcended their historical specificity,” and the “four stories together typify a timeless principle in ancient China” (Wu, 180). Another example shifts to the Liao dynasty again, in this case Baoshan Tomb 2, the tomb of a woman dated to around 930 CE. Two famous women—Su Hui, a fourth-century poet, and Yang Guifei, the favorite consort of the Tang dynasty Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–756)—are identified as the subjects of sumptuous paintings on opposite tomb walls. Wu notes that the paintings “emphasize women’s intimate relationship with texts” by showing both women in the act of reading or writing in a “fantasy world” of beautiful women and exotic plants from the distant south. He interprets the decorative program as an alter- native to paragons of filial piety—a feminine space of fashion, luxury, literacy, and romantic fantasy in the eternal home of a “royal lady” (Wu, 188). The chapter concludes with the visual metaphor of a journey as a way to connect the “four self-contained systems of temporal representation discussed above—cos- mological, experiential, historical or archaistic”—into a narrative of transformation (Wu, 192). The journey is defined as bipartite—“a funerary procession to the grave followed by an imaginary tour in the afterlife” (Wu, 194). Detailed examples of char- iot processions in Eastern Han tombs illustrate the ways in which the two journeys were organized. The author then delineates the development of a second type of pic- torial scheme in which the funerary procession and the posthumous ascension are symmetrically arranged and opposed, the former moving into the tomb while the lat- ter moves out (Wu, 204–5). Eventually, the painted processions on both sides turn outward to accompany the ascending soul in the passageways of Tang dynasty impe- rial tombs (Wu, 215). Similarly, the author understands the painting of murals in the passageways as a “long development prompted by a growing desire to create an ‘exhibition space’ outside the tomb chamber” (Wu, 211). Wu recognizes the disadvantage of organizing his narrative around a triad of abstract concepts: the evidence of complete tombs is fragmented across the book. As a corrective, he concludes The Art of the Yellow Springs with a coda in which he offers a whole “portrait” of three Chinese tombs: Mawangdui Tomb 1, Mancheng Tomb 1, and a Zhang family tomb at Xuanhua (Wu, 219–20). Here he wishes to dem- onstrate the “possible contributions of a conceptual interpretation to contextual and historical studies of individual tombs” (Wu, 220). Such a contribution is best demonstrated in the “portrait” of the tomb of Zhang Wenzao and his wife at Xuanhua. Wu notes that the tomb as well as the manikins or “restored bodies” of the deceased couple (80 and 90 centimeters long) were reduced in scale and that such miniaturization was the norm going back to tombs of the East- ern Han dynasty. In addition, illusionistic architectural elements in the tomb were reversed; that is, exterior architectural forms were imitated but arranged on the inte- </page> <page sequence="5"> History of Religions 177 rior walls of the tomb. Figures and activities framed by trompe l’oeil doors and win- dows suggest the passage of time. Objects placed in the tomb were represented again in wall paintings. All of this suggests to Wu the “desire to create metaphors for an intermediate time/space between life and death and between reality and fiction—a time/space to which the departed soul is supposed to belong” (231). Most importantly, Wu argues that the Zhang Wenzao tomb simultaneously repre- sents a sacrificial hall, a meditation chamber, and a transcendent paradise (225–27). The sacrificial hall is suggested by the offerings left around the manikins, the medita- tion chamber by the coffins decorated with Buddhist dha raṇı ̄ texts (magical, protec- tive Sanskrit words and phrases) and Buddhist sutras depicted on the walls, and the transcendent paradise by the Daoist books represented on the walls and the painting of three figures, usually Daoist immortals, playing chess. In this case the three figures are a Daoist priest, a Confucian scholar, and a Buddhist monk representing the har- monious relationship among the three religions. For Wu, the ability of the tomb to absorb different religious beliefs and practices around an unbroken tradition of ances- tor worship and filial piety is the key to the “logic” of the tomb (233). The Art of the Yellow Springs is the summation of more than twenty-five years of research on mortuary art by Wu Hung. His interpretations of visual evidence, some familiar and some new, rest to a large extent on the authority of transmitted classical texts and received scholarly categories. The book returns to fundamentals in order to produce a “genuine” understanding of the Chinese tomb as an essential, unified idea. Wu parts company with some historians who have applied a critical skepticism toward received texts and categories as part of a revisionist historical project—for example, Stephen F. Teiser, “The Spirits of Chinese Religion” (in Religions of China in Prac- tice, ed. Donald S. Lopez Jr. [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1996]), or Michael Loewe and Michael Nylan (eds., China’s Early Empires: A Re-appraisal [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010]). As an alternative, the author offers a theoretical paradigm in which criticism is overcome, not so much by denial but by sublation and an appeal to transcendent principles. This is consistent withWu’s finding that synthesis and syncretism form the logic of the “ancient Chinese mind” (7). The Art of the Yellow Springs is at times difficult to follow, the tripartite structure leading to repetition and disjuncture. The striking black dust jacket and high-quality color illustrations suggest a general audience for the book, as do the lack of Chinese characters and the omission of sources for the 200 illustrations, both standard accou- trements of scholarly publications in this field. Conversely, there is no chart of Chi- nese dynasties and their dates nor any maps, all helpful guides for the nonspecialist. The abstract, conceptual organization of the chapters is similarly conflicted, offering an invitingly sweeping narrative but sprinkled with scholarly details and disorienting, rapid shifts between tombs, themes, periods, and arguments. The audience for Sonya Lee’s Surviving Nirvana, on the other hand, is unmistak- ably scholarly, although the book is conflicted and disorienting in its own way. Lee describes the subject of her book—the nirvana image of a reclining S  akyamuni Bud- dha—as a “powerful allegory of survival, something of a utopian vision that could empower its beholders to look beyond the presentness of their existence and imagine other possibilities out there” (4). At the same time, “the choice to highlight the poly- semous nature of the nirvana image helps defuse the propensity to construe historical </page> <page sequence="6"> 178 Book Reviews significance from one vantage point as some deep cultural secrets awaiting discovery by the modern investigator” (11). There is an emphasis on viewership and reception, but, following Alfred Gell, the image is understood as an active “social agent” (Lee, 5). Rather than a product of historical circumstance to be deciphered, the nirvana image for Lee advocates and motivates: it is a rhetorical instrument that produces meaning. Surviving Nirvana offers readers four distinct phases in the development of the nir- vana image in China. Initially, the image was an essential part of S  akyamuni Bud- dha’s biography as the scene of the “great departure.” Then, in a monumental stele dated to 551, the usual reclining image of the Buddha was “doubled” by the addition of a parallel second image: a coffin surrounded by mourners (Lee, 53–56). The intro- duction of the coffin as the equivalent to the Buddha’s body “would take it out of its Hinayana root as part of an ever progressive temporality and integrate it into the inter- penetrating Buddha universe of ChineseMahayana” (Lee, 81). In the next phase, a sequential narrative of the nirvana emerges. This is exempli- fied in a stone stele from Shanxi province dated to 691 and labeled in its dedication as a niepan bian or “nirvana transformation” (Lee, 83). Lee identifies three modalities on the stele. The first is the Buddha in anthropomorphic form preaching before his nirvana and then reclining at the moment of nirvana. Then comes the Buddha encased in a coffin. And, third, are the relics of the Buddha after cremation (Lee, 84 and 103– 4). Lee finds the three modalities to be pervasive in the late seventh and eighth centu- ries (84–85). The author argues that pictorial nirvana narratives emphasized the transformation of S  akyamuni from human to relic, and “S  akyamuni’s presence as relics in the human realm was depicted next to Maitreya as the crucial final phase of a transition that would lead directly to the coming of the Future Buddha” (Lee, 124). But at the con- clusion of a long exegesis on S  akyamuni’s relics and their veneration under the reign of Empress Wu Zetian (690–705), Lee concludes that the pictorial nirvana narrative “daringly presented a counterpoint” to Maitreya, the Future Buddha, that “promoted S  akyamuni as everlastingly present and ready to assert his authority in whatever exis- tential form he took in this world” (137). The discussion then turns to Tang dynasty “nirvana caves” at Dunhuang and their impact on the viewer in two contrasting interior spaces. In Mogao Cave 332 the sculpted reclining Buddha is set across the rear wall behind the central pillar, an anach- ronistic arrangement in the late seventh century. The nirvana image in Mogao Cave 148, on the other hand, fills the rear wall and dominates the shallow but open interior space in front of the sculpture. Lee adroitly negotiates the structural difference of the two caves by proposing that a “nirvana cave” is “not determined by the exact size and shape of a cave but rather by an underlying design logic that advocates the deterrence of any perceptual totality of the nirvana Buddha” (145). That is, neither nirvana image can be seen as a whole—the view is blocked by the central pillar in Cave 332 and restricted to one section at a time in the long but narrow interior of Cave 148. The author returns to Empress Wu again to argue that the pictorial program of Cave 332 was a “deliberate attempt by the Li family [local patrons of Cave 332] to make public their allegiance to the Wu Zhou regime” (169). The evidence is a “wheel-turning” mudr a displayed by three Buddha images on the front wall and the </page> <page sequence="7"> History of Religions 179 connection of this mudr a to a sutra, the Treasure Rain Scripture (Boyu jing, T no. 660), associated with the promotion of Empress Wu (169–74). Three generations later, however, Li family descendants constructed Cave 148 with, according to Lee, “prior knowledge and prolonged exposure” to Cave 332. Yet, there is no mention of the earlier Li family cave in the long dedication for Cave 148. Rather, the author sur- mises that the highly politicized form of Buddhism inspired byWu Zetian “no longer commanded interest or even respect” (201). Surviving Nirvana concludes by following the nirvana image underground where it “had solidified its association with the relic by making the hidden space of relic depos- its its new home” (Lee, 204). Lee focuses on two Northern Song dynasty relic crypts from Dingzhou, Hebei province. The first, under the Jingzhi Monastery pagoda, con- tained a series of five dated deposits and recoveries: the initial deposit in 453 and recovery in 603, redeposit in 606 and recovery in 849, redeposit in 858 and recovery in 889, redeposit in 889 and recovery in 976, and final redeposit in 977. On the back wall above the main stone relic case was written a cartouche announcing “The True Body Relics of S  akyamuni Buddha” flanked by paintings of venerating disciples. There was no depiction of the nirvana in the crypt. The closest references are the soles of feet, presumably the Buddha’s, depicted on one end of a small metal relic casket and the wish to reach “the city of nirvana” in two donor inscriptions (Lee, 227–28). The author explains that the nirvana “motif now manifested itself synecdochically on different objects in the deposit” (Lee, 204). The second deposit was discovered nearby under the cloister of the Jingzhong monastery cluster and dated by inscription to 995. Here the familiar nirvana scene was painted on the rear wall of the crypt. But the inscription on the relic case suggests that the remains are those of the founder of the temple, the monk Yiyan. Lee inter- prets the prominent display of the nirvana scene as both an attempt to equate Yiyan’s passing with S  akyamuni’s enlightenment and compensation for the lack of the genu- ine relics of the Buddha (Lee, 257). Conversely, the presence of the “True Body Relics” in the Jingzhi pagoda deposit made the visual depiction of the nirvana scene superfluous. Similarities between relic crypts and underground tombs have been noted by numerous scholars including Hsueh-man Shen (“Buddhist Relic Deposits from Tang (618–907) to Northern Song (960–1127) and Liao (907–1125” [PhD thesis, Oxford University, 2000]). The Jingzhi and Jingzhong crypts seem to resemble the space of contemporary underground tombs, which in the Northern Song dynasty enshrined cremated remains in stone urns (Wu, 139). The relics or ashes were both surrounded by offerings, painted entertainment scenes, and guardian figures. The center of the rear wall of both relic crypts and tombs were painted with “portraits” of the deceased. On each side wall of the Jingzhong crypt, an ensemble of heavenly musicians was depicted moving away from the Buddha and toward the entrance. The author describes the groups as a “complement to the Buddha’s nirvana at the back” (Lee, 241), but followingWu’s study of Chinese tombs, we might consider the direction of the procession indicative of the departure of the Buddha or Yiyan from the crypt. Lee, however, firmly rejects any likening of a relic deposit to a tomb burial. She argues, first, that the Jingzhi pagoda example and others demonstrate that the relic deposit was an impermanent burial, part of a cyclical process in which the deposit </page> <page sequence="8"> 180 Book Reviews was meant to be discovered when the pagoda structure was in need of refurbishment. The redeposits, which involved additional containers and embellishments, were fun- damental to the function of the relic burial. Second, the example of the Jingzhong cloister relic deposit exemplifies the specific Buddhist practice of conflating a revered monastic with S  akyamuni (Lee, 207). In both cases, Lee argues, the purpose and goals of relic deposits differ from burial in tombs. For the author, the adoption of the reclining nirvana image in the relic deposits of monks represents a sharp break from a historically specific referent to the “ultimate sign of spiritual attainment.” This change “compromised” the value of the image’s old association with S  akyamuni Buddha and the “instability in signification that resulted from the intentional conflation of subject and exemplar in the twoNorthern Song cases was indeed at the greatest in the history of the nirvana image in medieval China.” Fur- thermore, “the hidden space of relic deposits had opened up a new realm of interpreta- tive possibilities by exploiting the ambiguity inherent in the motif’s very configura- tion” (Lee, 262). The ambitious reach of Surviving Nirvana is informed by an impressive command of Chinese Buddhist texts and inscriptions as well as secondary scholarship in Chinese and Japanese. The author’s focus on new and original, perhaps some may find novel, interpretations offers much of interest to scholars of Chinese history and religion. In contrast to The Art of the Yellow Springs, which places its argument firmly within the framework of past scholarship on the tomb, Surviving Nirvana is concerned with the singularity of its subject in the history of Chinese Buddhist art. The focus is narrow. There is minimal attention to the place of the nirvana image among the many contem- porary visions of the afterlife such as the heavenly abodes of the Buddhas S  akyamuni, Maitreya, Bhaiṣajyaguru, or Amitabha, or the dazzling visual imagery derived from the Lotus sutra, whose primary actor is the transcendent S  akyamuni Buddha. In Sur- viving Nirvana the emphasis on new and original interpretations results in a sense of disengagement from, rather than critique of, conventional scholarly understandings. And important new studies such as Stephen Teiser’s award-winning Reinventing the Wheel: Paintings of Rebirth in Medieval Buddhist Temples (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2006); Eugene Wang’s magisterial exploration of the Lotus sutra, Shaping the Lotus Sutra: Buddhist Visual Culture inMedieval China (Seattle: Univer- sity of Washington Press, 2005); or the volume edited by Bryan Cuevas and Jacque- line Stone, The Buddhist Dead: Practices, Discourses, Representations (Honolulu: University of Hawai‘i Press, 2007), are largely ignored. The Art of the Yellow Springs and Surviving Nirvana end in the space of the tomb and relic crypt, respectively. Hidden in darkness, the syncretic religion of the post- mortem encounters the Buddhist utopia of nirvana. Here, stimulated by these two ambitious books, historians of all stripes will hopefully find inspiration to peer even more deeply into the fascinating world of the afterlife in China. STANLEY K.
