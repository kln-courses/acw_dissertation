<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SO-CALLED PEISISTRATEAN EDITION OF HESIOD. IN the Classical Quarterly for July-October, 1924, the late Mr. H. G. Evelyn White sought (I) to establish that the vulgate of Hesiod is a conflation of two or more versions; (2) to point out the inference to be drawn, and to suggest a date for the formation of the received text. To establish his first point in respect of the Works and Days he gives a list of eighteen passages where he suspects the hand of a conflator. The inference that he draws is that the vulgate text can be nothing else than the result of a deliberate conflation by an editor whose aim was to produce a standard version; that the editor's working principle was 'gather up the fragments that nothing be lost.' The formation of this text he would put in the time of Peisistratus, for its critical canons clearly put it outside Alexandrian times or the fourth century; and even in the fifth the knowledge of Hesiod was so widespread that so revolutionary a change in the text was then impossible. It must have been in the sixth century, and was probably done at Athens under Peisistratus. For what force would there be in the accusation of Heraius of Megara, third century B.c. (ap. Plut. Thes. XX. = Rzach, Fr. 105), who charged Peisistratus with suppressing a line reflecting adversely upon Theseus, if there had not been a tradition that Peisistratus had somehow influenced the Hesiodic text ? ' But the fact [?] that we have two (or more) versions "stitched together " into one '-that is the grand argument in favour of a Peisistratean, or at least a sixth-century, edition. But an examination of the eighteen annotated passages on which the author relies will scarcely convince the reader of the truth of the conflation theory, and it is on this conflation theory that the whole structure of the argument rests (p. 149, C.Q., 1924). Evelyn White's first error seems to me to be that he forgot that repetitioU, far from being evidence of the existence of a dual version, is one of the characteristic marks of early verse (especially verse of a didactic kind-e.g., The Book of Proverbs). But it would be unfair not to examine his argument in detail, and see whether the passages he gives will really bear the inference which he draws from them. i. Ll. i-Io. This can hardly be counted relevant. The existence of a version not containing these lines at the very most could only prove that the lines were an interpolation, and in this case does not even prove that (see Mazon's edition, pp. 36-39; also F. Leo, Hesiodea, G6ttingen, 1894). It cannot be adduced to prove the existence of a parallel version. 2. Ll. 72-76. Evelyn White admits that 1. 76 is probably interpolated to replace 1. 72 (which= Theog. 573), and they may not be an example of the doublets which he is seeking. 3. Ll. 116-I20. A.=11. 116 fin. ~rOXa l8 rrdvra--I8 c0ovov-the conflator having cut out - u o - -, which would have completed the verse and made it exactly parallel to B, ot 8' E0eXqr/o--'I20. The trouble is that 1. 120 has no MS. authority, and is only vouched for by Diodorus (see Rzach, ed. ma., ad loc.). Moreover, the so-called B version ol 3' 0BOE1 O KTX. is not a mere repetition of A. If we had only B and not A it would be nowhere stated that the earth of its own accord bore crops. 4. L1. 169, I69a-b-173. The alternative versions are given thus: A, 11. 172 sq.; B, 11. 169, I69a-b, reading these B lines after 1. 173 with Rzach, not after 1. 168.</page><page sequence="2">196 T. A. SINCLAIR But of the lines assigned to the B version, 1. 169 is only introduced from Proclus into certain late MSS., and cannot be said to be part of the received text, much less the fragmentary lines 169a-b, which are found only in the Geneva papyrus. In fact the B lines, far from showing that conflation has occurred, are strong evidence that it has not, for they are not even intelligibly incorporated in the text at all. Those copyists who did add the line that is called 169 did not know where to put it, seeing that the lenmma of Proclus is to be found at 1. 158 (not 1. 169 as Rzach says; it is on p. 115 in Gaisford, Vol. III.); but the scholium refers to 1. 174, and one MS. has it after 1. 173 (so Paley, crit. note). That the Geneva lines should be added to 1. 169 (J. Nicole, Rev. de Philologie XII. 113) is probably quite right, but there seems to be no reason why any of the lines should appear in the text at all. Interpolation was attempted, perhaps in the interests of Orphism,' but failed to succeed, and the misplaced lemma of Proclus and the mutilated Geneva papyrus are interesting traces of the attempt. The Alexandrian critics were not deceived. 5. Ll. 169c-d, 174 sqq. A=11. I6oc-d, 176-178; B=l11. 174-177, 182 sq. Ll. 169c-d stand or fall with 169a-b; but even if they were genuine the existence of the doublet would depend on the way in which the fragments were restored. There is no repetition in ?Weil's first restoration (Rev. de Philologie XII. 113). For the rest there is no difference, except that A is said to have 1. 178 and not B. 6. Ll. 178-181 are said to belong only to A, apparently because 11. 179-18I were bracketed by Lehrs, and because they would make a very suitable endinzg to a description of one of the ages. But Lehrs's bracketing is most unreasonable, it merely takes the words out of the poet's mouth just when he was making his prophetic announcement; and there is no reason why 11. 178-181 should end the prophecy. 7. Ll. 182-201. 'The variants distinguished in this section are sub-variants within the second of the two main versions of the " Iron Age."' Ll. (a) I85-136 are said to be a pair of doublets to 11. I87-I88. But they do not look like alternatives. The second follows and supplements the other quite naturally. L. 189, which is clearly only an inept expansion of the gloss on 1. 192 XELPo8&amp;Kat, is divided; it sends XELPO&amp;KaL to take the place of ovK To-rat in 1. 193. The rest of it is left in the air. And oV;K 'o-'ra-, which pace Evelyn White, is needed to make 1. 192 intelligible, disappears, because no place can be found for it in the a-version to which it is asserted 11. 191-192 belong. 8. L1. 225-237. A, 11. 225-229; B, 11. 230-237. There is no exact correspon- dence in the subject-matter in the two passages, so the author relies on the verbal correspondence of the opening 6KaUS . . - ElaS followed by -TOi-L, 1. 227, and the 10v8lK7K 7t and a similarly placed 7i0^o- in the B version. But these are merely two examples of a very common mode of expansion in Hesiod and in all gnomic poetry. The type is,' He that diggeth a pit, himself shall fall therein.' Compare in this poem 11. 238-239, 282-284, 359-360, and many others. 9. L1. 238-247. A, 1. 238+11. 239-241; B, 1. 238+11. 242-247. It is remarked that the lot of the unrighteous is twice stated, but again, since there is no similarity between the two statements, the author relied on the repetition--o7o ; (1. 239), -ro-t'v ' (1. 242)--which has no real significance. Ll. 242-247 may be said to supple- ment 11. 239-241, but there is no reason to regard them as alternatives. Io. L1. 249-255. A, 11. 249 Ty7S ydp-251 ; B, 11. 252 Tpis 7YP-255. But 1. 248 cannot be left without -,jiVSE ilCrKv (1. 249), which would have to go if B were sub- stituted for A. It is true that much the same thing is said in 11. 249-25I as in 11. 252-255. But in the former passage it is said of the gods themselves, in the latter of Zeus' ten thousand spirits; these are added by way of explanation-explanation 1 Mazon, p. 75.</page><page sequence="3">THE SO-CALLED PEISISTRATEAN EDITION OF HESIOD 197 very necessary. The anthropomorphic gods of Olympus could not themselves be everywhere at once. Hesiod had to find a wider sanction for his plea for justice than could be found in them. II. Ll. 298-307. A, 11. 298-301; B, 11. 303-307. Both passages are exhortations to work with warnings to those who will not. So are 11. 311-316, to say nothing of 11. 397-39S. In fact the whole poem is so permeated with this gospel of work that if we were to restrict the poet to one reference only to work half his theme would be gone. This would be ridiculous, but it would be a logical extension of the author's method. Ll. 298-307 must stand as they are. i2. Ll. 392-404. After yv7v'v S' PddCELV (1. 392) one may read A EL X' pL . V-toU-, or B Ep'ydUE K7,k. (1. 397), leaving the beginning of 1. 397 (0Y' EWLErtp-o-E0) to be a conflator's addition. This is supported (a) by the supposed correspondence of 1. 393 with 1. 398-a correspondence so slight as to be negligible; and (b) by the fact that 11. 399-400 express much the same as 11. 394-395. The most that can be inferred from that is that 11. 399-400 may be interpolated, but the evidence against them is slight. 13. Ll. 410-413. A, 11. 410 and 41I; B, 11. 41o0 a ar-' dvapdAcXXEo-OaL +412 pEaX'ET &amp; Trot -pYov dEXAEL +413. The correspondence in this case is more striking and the repetition to us unnecessary. But the division of the passage here given is most unnatural; in B i,48' Jvafl3dXEo-Ooe would be left as a complete sentence; a pause after - u u - - - or - - - uu - is of course very common, but only when the sense is carried on from the previous line (e.g., 11. 781-782, 602-603, etc.). If any division is necessary, surely it is A= 1. 4o, B=11. 411-413. For (i) E-owo-oEpyob div-p follows naturally enough after 1. 409; (2) there is no reason to put r'wo-'oEpydos and dppoAtEpyks in different versions; their meaning is not exactly the same, and if we exclude 1. 410 the words are in their natural places. All this is evidence, not for any conflation, but simply for regarding 1. 41o as an interpolation. This is not improbable since it is in itself a complete and familiar proverb. 14. L1. 479-490. A, 11. 479-484; B, 11. 485-490. A begins ' But if you plough at the solstice,' and B, ' But if you plough late,' and on this the author relies for support. But a reading of the whole passage will serve to convince anyone that nothing could be more natural than the repetition Ed 8 KEV ' po-1s. ' If you plough at the solstice you will have a poor crop, etc., but if you should plough late, I can offer you this remedy.' It is almost essential that i6 in order to be intelligible should be preceded by jEXAtoo rporj. 5. L1. 493-535. Here three versions are distinguished: A, 11. 493-499; B, 11. 504-523; C, 11. 493, 524-535. Evelyn White thinks A is the original; B, 'the work of a rhapsode who saw the opportunity to introduce a striking picture of winter'; C, ' the work of a poet who sought to produce a rival version.' No evidence is adduced for the separation of A and B.1 For separating B and C the reasons given are not weighty, especially in a poem where a high degree of artistic skill is not to be looked for. Thus (a) not to stop at 1. 523 would make a very long sentence; (b) both passages present pictures essentially the same. This is only partly true; Hesiod reverts in 1. 529 sqq. to the picture of shivering animals which he had already had occasion to mention in connexion with the North Wind; but there is little to be deduced from the fact. It is true that tne genuineness of much of this description of winter was called in question by the older editors (e.g., Lehrs), but it has been ably vindicated by P. Mazon," as well as by E. de Franco.3 The third reason given is 1 Perhaps the author intended us to refer to his earlier article in Class. Rev. XXX., 1916, p. 209, on 'Hesiod's Description of Winter,' where 11. 504-523 are said to ' stand out strongly in tone and colour.' 2 Les Travaux et les Jours. Edition nouvelle, Paul Mazon.

But in the first place it is not suggested that they were reached separately: secondly, there is no difficulty in understanding how the poet, pleased with his own conceit, liked to repeat it. The ingenuity of the author's explanation is quite misplaced. 16. Ll. 618-662. Again three versions are said to be distinguishable: A, 11. 618-640; B, 11. 641-645; C, 11. 618, 646-662. It is stated that in all three groups the initial lines are to the same effect. This is not true of B and a great exaggeration in respect of A and C. (Note that 1. 618 is included in both A and C.) The question is then asked: ' Is it likely that a single poet would thus begin his subject thrice over?' It is only necessary to read the whole passage to see that the question is futile. ' If you are thinking of voyaging at the setting of the Pleiades, don't do it; put away your gear and wait for the proper time, then begin, as our father did (11. 618-640). In everything you should observe the proper time, especially in seafaring, and you should choose your vessel carefully (11. 641-645). Then when you are ready to begin I will tell you all about it-though my experience is limited to sailing on the Euripus-you remember the time,' etc. (11. 646-662). Hesiod then proceeds (11. 665 sqq.) to give the advice promised. The continuity is perfect. The worst that can be said is that the poet rambles a little before coming to the point. 17. Ll. 678-694. A, 11. 678-681, 689-694; B, 11. 682-688. The author was doubtful about this one, and rightly so since it seems to depend on the similarity of 11. 687 and 691. 18. Ll. 765-768. A, 11. 765 sqq.; B, 11. 769, 768 (sic). The mention of 'jpara a ' iK LAtOEV in 1. 765 and at'*e yap p//pat ElorI in 1. 769 is the supposed reason. But 1. 769 with its -yp could hardly follow 1. 764. L. 765 is the only one that could introduce the subject. The net result of the foregoing examination seems to be that in passage (7) 1. 192 may be an interpolation as also 1. 410 in passage (13). There is some suspicion of interpolation also in passages (12) and (15). The grounds are scarcely sufficient to build a theory of conflation on; but indeed the author does not wait for the evidence before assuming the truth of his own theory. All through the first part of his paper -the part we have just been examining-we find statements of this kind: 'The con- flated versions, then, formed part of the Hesiodic text current in the fourth century.' Such statements, whether about the fourth or fifth century, are backed up by good evidence. But surely it is a flagrant petitio Jrinci~pii to speak of the ' conflated versions.' There is abundant evidence, as his quotations show, for the existence of a text of the Works and Days in the fourth and fifth centuries B.c., and if it was a conflation where is the evidence for a pre-conflation text or texts ? Evelyn White's quotations only go to show that the so-called conflation probably never took place. The inferences which the author drew in the second half of his article were summarized at the beginning of this chapter, and if I have succeeded in disposing of the base on which his main inference rested, it will be unnecessary to examine the remainder of the article in detail. But in respect of the existence of a so-called Peisistratean edition, I still preserve an open mind; it is quite possible the poems of Hesiod shared in the boom in literature. But of the particular form and content of that 'edition' we know nothing, and the dissection of the Works and Days leads to no remarkable discoveries. T. A. SINCLAIR.</page></plain_text>
