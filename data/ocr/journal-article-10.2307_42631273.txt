<plain_text><page sequence="1">Herbert W. Hemphill, Jr., Folk Sculpture, U.S.A. Brooklyn, N.Y. : The Brooklyn Museum, 1976, 76 pp., iilus., $8.25. In reviewing this volume, which is really an exhibi- tion catalogue, it is necessary to address two aspects: the extremely significant essays which have been included, and the many illustrated works which comprise, for the reader, the exhibition. There are three internal essays, a foreword, an introduction, and a very useful bibliography. The book thus becomes a symposium which will launch the reader into a subject of strong contemporary interest, and for this reason would be uncommonly useful as resource material for a course on folk or popular art. A genuinely important essay is "Folk Sculpture Without Folk", by Daniel Robbins, Visiting Professor, History of Art, Dartmouth College. Robbins gives a brief historiography of folk art, and especially of naive art (which can occur when there are no "folk"). He sees Robert Goldwateťs Primitivism in Modern Art (1938) as having "brought intellectual order into an area that previously could only be described as chaotic", (p. 12) and discusses the various tendencies of taste which have made folk art function as a kind of "found object" or play the role of lightening-rod for our dreams of a simpler society. He concludes, somewhat wistfully, that "among the many in- fluences and relationships that have contributed to the formation of American folk art, we - collec- tors, dealers, curators, or historians - must add our own influence." (p. 30) Michael Kan, Curator of African, Oceanic, and New World Cultures at The Brooklyn Museum, in "American Folk Sculpture: Some Con- siderations of its Ethnic Heritage," discusses Black and New Mexican Spanish ethnic styles as specialized New World developments rooted in African and Spanish traditions. Black forms in- clude the effigy vessels of South Carolina, certain voodoo images like "Baron Samedi" smeared with chicken blood and found in New Orleans, and Afro-American staffs and walking sticks with their West African reptilian motifs, as well as profound- ly sensitive folk works like the Black figures from Hamilton, Ohio. The superb bultos and retablos (sculptural and flat images) from the santeros of New Mexico and southern Colorado represent the flowering of an isolated culture with their hatted saints, numinous virgencitas , and the awesome images of skeletal Death with a bow and arrow, which were pulled in carts by penitents and flagellants. RACAR, Vol. 3 - N° 2 107</page><page sequence="2">Herbert W. Hemphill Jr., in his introduction to the catalogue which accompanied the 1976 exhibi- tion, "Folk Sculpture, U.S.A.", at the Brooklyn Museum, states of the collection that "the attempt here is to emphasize primarily those pieces that would not appear in the Index [of American Design] and that have been ignored or misinter- preted for so long." The Index to which he refers was "a monumental compilation" of " all the extant good material" which was "sponsored by the federal government to record the handicrafts of pre-industrial America," published in 1950 (p. 8). Included in the Index were a host of splendid works, including carousel figures, cigar store figures, ship's figureheads, and similar forms which, though no one in the present book says it, have definite prototypes in Baroque style. They have a common reliance on a Neo-Classical quali- ty, with their drapery and figurai origins in ul- timately Hellenistic conventions. Canadian works of a similar type may be found in the superb French Canadian sculptural tradition, or in the marine figureheads of Nova Scotia. Quite properly, such forms found a place in J. Russell Harper's pivotal exhibition and catalogue, People's Art : Naive Art in Canada (Ottawa: The National Gallery of Canada, 1974). The presence of influences from "high art" is perfectly appropriate for folk art, and some writers would almost make it a definition. "The word 'folk'... suggests the inclusion of pea- sant and rustic people who are not wholly indepen- dent of cities," Robert Redfield states in "The Folk Society," The American Journal of Sociology (January, 1947), and Helmuth Th. Bossert states that "A history of folk art should begin with the time of the neo-Renaissance... when the breach between town and country, between educated and uneducated people, became apparent." ( Peasant Art of Europe and Asia ; New York: Praeger, 1966). What has been included in "Folk Sculpture, U.S.A." ? Included are precisely those works which are least influenced by, or perhaps least capable of, a "formal" or "classical" style. They strongly resemble the objects in a splendid Canadian book, Les Patenteux du Québec by Louise de Grosbois, Raymonde Lamothe and Lise Nantel (Montréal: Parti Pris, 1974). (A " patenteur " is a "gadget- maker, one who likes to put things together, but nothing of earth-shaking importance," a French Canadian colleague tells me.) It must be admitted that there are some cigar store figures, and one breathtaking image, "The Black Slave" (which may have served as a trade sign for a New Orleans slave auction), that do have undeniable classical form, if staring eyes. Perhaps the most ubiquitous trait of the human figures - there are animals too, but this is a predominately anthropomorphic show - is what Michael D. Hall refers to when he speaks of Edgar Tolson's work in the book's third essay, "A Sorting Process : The Artist as Collector" : "I've seen dozens of them and they always have that frozen frontality that's so in-turned..." (p. 39) Rudolf Arnheim says in Art and Visual Perception (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969): "Every beginner in the art of sculpture finds that the cubic concept imposes itself upon his work. When he tries to abandon it in favor of the kind of roundness that was achieved during the Renaissance, he has to overcome the Egyptian in himself." (p. 211) Faces here are like masks, awesomely frontal, with staring eyes fixed straight ahead, a syndrome found in every first-year sculpture class. The works in Folk Sculpture , U.S.A. are monumental expressions of the whittler's art; as such they are a masculine art. These sexual categories still operate at the vernacular level of our society ; the artists whose names are listed in the catalogue are, without exception, males. In addi- tion to the masterpieces already mentioned, the reader is referred to "The Buckeye Family" (c. 1925), by Joe Lee (d. 1941), with its strangely multi-racial demeanor; the sad-faced, endlessly peddling "Bicycle Boy" (c. 1922); the Kali-esque "Bathing Beauty" (1973) by Clarence Stringfield (b. 1903); and the delightful "Newsboy" (1889), a trade sign in which a lad eternally runs toward us with the Pawtucket Record held aloft.

Edgar Toison (b. 1904) "Paradise Barred", 1969/70, Painted Wood, '5Vi'' Collection: Michael and Julie Hall. 108 RACAR, Vol. 3 - N° 2</page><page sequence="3">I have left till last a mention of the "Cain and Abel" series illustrated here (Figure 1) with "Paradise Barred" (1969/70), by Edgar Toison (b. 1904). This work, which one writer calls an "anachronism," seems to me a very parable of an American culture which collects and exhibits these objects of art. The primal pair (Toison thinks, untheologically, that the "original sin" was the charmingly priapic coupling of the two - he knows nothing of the Fall as a disobedience to God) stand in their new clothing, with the snake at their heels, outside the picket fence of Paradise, which is guarded by a sternly vigilant angel against re-entry. The lovely little tree still droops its forbidden apples of self-knowledge ; that terrible knowledge is to come, for the rest of the series shows the killing of Abel by Cain and concludes with the stiffly standing image of Cain, in awful clothes-peg angst , his whittled stare gazing into the present we all occupy. Anachronistic? Innocent? Childlike? The technique may be all these things, but the reality is one for adults. Maybe this is the quality that kept these works out of the beautiful Index , and makes them fit icons for contemplation today. Naney-Lou Patterson University of Waterloo Waterloo</page></plain_text>
