Pp. xxxv + 435. $39.50. The work by Churgin, completed as a Ph.D. dissertation under C. C. Torrey in 1922 and published in 1927 by Yale University Press, contains a detailed exegesis of the official Targum to the Prophets known as Tg. Neb. and raises, among other issues, important questions of origin, date, and Sitz im Leben. The conclusion reached is that Tg. Neb. is an essential part of early Palestinian aggadic literary activity, later greatly influenced by the school of R. Akiba, though hardly a work to be attributed to any singular author or redactor (contra b. Meg. 3a), whose final redaction and recognition occurred in the Babylonian academies of the fifth century c.e. The view of Frankel, Schürer, Buhl, Graetz, and others that Tg. Neb. is the work of R. Joseph, the fourth-century Amorah who was president of the Pumbeditha academy, is not valid, since R. Joseph often cites Tg. Neb. with the introductory phrase, "But for the</page><page sequence="2">320 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 48, 1986 Targum [Jonathan] of this verse . . ."(e.g., b. Sanh. 94b; b. Moced Qat. 28b; b. Meg. 3a), thus implying that he is not the author but an authority quoting Tg. Neb. A strong character of paraphrase and commentary influenced by rabbinic interpreta- tion of contemporary events, e.g., Jewish suffering under the hostility of Rome, is evident throughout Tg. Neb. Quotations of the Law indicate dependence on the Tg. Onkelos, and, like the latter, Tg. Neb. originated during the Synagogue service as the Aramaic translation of the weekly prophetic lesson. The frequent embellishment of the prophetic reading by the mětůrgěman ("interpreter"), despite restrictions pro- vided by halaka (cf. b. Meg. 32a ; y. Meg. 74d; b. Kid. 49a), has given rise to a plethora of variants. The indispensable value of C.'s work, consequently, is his colla- tion of textual variants and analytical comparisons with the Bible in its various translations, coupled with his examination of the different types of deviations and interpolations. His general conclusion that "there was a common source for the official Targumim. They were originated in one and the same time, in one and the same way, under one and the same circumstances, and share a common history" (p. 263 = p. 35 in the C. text) has stood the test of scholarly investigation. Since the publication of C.'s pioneering research (he also published a less suc- cessful critical account of The Targum to the Hagiographa [Hebrew] in 1945), much has appeared, particularly of late, on many aspects of targumic studies as they relate to cognate fields of study: LXX and other biblical translations, rabbinic Judaism, NT literature, and the history of Aramaic languages. Aside from textual and linguistic studies, little has been done to study the structure and text of the targums in compari- son with one another, with their cultural and historical background, and with the full range of the classic rabbinic mind. To correct this lacuna, L. Smolar and M. Aber- bach, respectively the President of the Baltimore Hebrew College and the Professor of Literature and History at the College, decided to write an independent volume and not a shorter prolegomenon to the reissue of C.'s classic. Their efforts will prove a valuable source of information in understanding the Weltanschauung of Tg. Neb. The authors' basic concern for context is admirable. In three tightly argued sections containing 227 pages of text and 1,418 footnotes, S. and A. attempt an understanding of the major conceptual issues found in Tg. Neb. Section one estab- lishes that the halaka in Tg. Neb. is that of the Judaism of R. Akiba and his school. Often biblical mores and precepts are modified to conform to the orthodoxy of rabbinical halaka. Noteworthy in this regard are laws and customs of cult, rites of passage, and personal status. The school of R. Akiba established the principle of unchanging halaka before and since Sinai. Agreement with this philosophy enables many a biblical text to be altered, historical accuracy to be compromised, and bibli- cal heroes to conform to rabbinic morality. In viewing the latter as timeless role models for future generations, rabbinic apologetics minimalizes the seriousness of their sinful acts. For example, the obscure phrase in 1 Sam 17:18b (". . . and take their pledge") is rendered midrashically in Tg. Neb.: ". . . and take the bills of divorcement of their wives and bring them." Thus soldiers in Saul's army granted conditional divorces to their wives before they went to war, thereby avoiding the problem of the càgûnâ ("chained woman," who may not remarry if proof of her husband's death is not forthcoming). Hence David's act with Bathsheba (a single</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 321 woman) was legally proper albeit morally repugnant (see b. Šabb. 56a: "Whoever says that David sinned [with Bathsheba] is totally mistaken"). The fragmentary nature of targumic translation and annotation of biblical material is systematically presented in section two. The section yields many illustra- tions of the midrashic tendency to contemporize biblical history and geography. Many passages of the former are seen as reflecting the Hasmonean and Roman periods, and ancient place names of the latter are identified with current talmudic usage. The assertion made by C. that there are references to Sassanid Persia in the text of Tg. Neb. (e.g., Tg. Neb. on Isa 21:9) is denied by S. and A., who maintain that Bābel (like Edom) means only Rome when used cryptically in rabbinic literature. In the third part of the book, the authors investigate types of Tg. Neb. theology and point out that it is generally faithful to the teachings found in the Mishna, which reflects the positions of R. Akiba and his school. Deviations from the MT do not witness to another reading, but rather mean that Tg. Neb. encompasses a commen- tary of sorts; this is particularly true in regard to offensive and/or disagreeable material. Anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms have been removed from the concept of deity, and the human weaknesses of patriarchs, prophets, and people (Israel) are explained in a spiritual sense or give way to spiritualizing tendencies of later days. S. and A. correctly assert that the elimination of anthropomorphic state- ments about the nature of the Deity by the insertion of an intermediary phrase or by sentence circumlocution is due to the concern of the rabbis that the unsophisticated synagogue masses - the core audience for the public rendition of the targums - might take scriptural language literally and thus form a totally wrong impression of God. This concern is behind the substitutions of descriptive appelations ("place," "heaven," "the Holy One, blessed be he," etc.) for the tetragrammaton and the rabbinic tradi- tion of the tiqqûnê sôpèrîm. Likewise, the divine mêmrâD is of early origin and there is nothing in this concept to imply Greek influence. Unlike the Greek Logos, the Memra of the targums represents neither identity nor essence; it is merely an inter- mediate word like yēqārāD ("glory") and qãdêm ("in the presence of') to disguise biblical anthropomorphic expression. The remainder of the section is a collation of Tg. Neb. statements on Israel, nations of the world, reward and punishment, theo- dicy, eschatology, and similar topics, discussed in conjunction with other relevant targums and other rabbinic literature. Smolar and Aberbach demonstrate a fine mastery of textual and lexical sources which are interpreted in light of the complex historical background. A great deal of information is compacted in the authors' encyclopedic style, which at times impedes the flow of ideas. But any concerned reader, even without knowledge of the targumic genre, if he or she is willing to work, will find S. and A.'s comments extremely rewarding. The book is in the tradition of classical philological study and conven- tional rabbinic research. Consequently, the work lacks a modern exegetical metho- dology; this raises questions similar to those of biblical higher criticism. Basically, questions of biographies, Formgeschichte, Gattungen, developments of redaction, and history of traditions are not posed. By restricting their comments only to the received literary texts, S. and A. could be accused of pseudo-critical fundamentalism, which does not necessarily advance the field of targumic studies. On the other hand,</page><page sequence="4">322 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 48, 1986 perhaps the approach of traditional scholarship may be misunderstood. Indeed, without it contemporary critical research may not be accomplished. This may be explained by a parable, although not a very apt one. It is like an architect who asked for a stone and they gave him a brick, for he intended to build a university, while they intended to build a bêt midrās to study in. Both places, you are to understand, are appropriate for critical study and reflection. In spite of careful proofreading, a number of typographical errors went unde- tected: "gverning," p. xxx; "notor-ious," p. 124; "ture," p. 149, n. 134; "prcisely," p. 150; "anser," p. 152; "poing," p. 219; "conncept," p. 220, n. 572. Other errors include "and and," p. xxi; "Is is," p. 60; p. 100, n. 220: add p. 82; on p. 149, n. 139, the reference to Deut 18:17-18 is not clear; similarly unclear is p. 224, n. 601, where Acts 8:23 is cited as a proof text suggesting that angelology is denied by the Sadducees. At the end of the volume are found passages cited (biblical, rabbinic, and other literature), classical authors, and subject indexes for only the S. and A. work. Foot- notes and not endnotes are found throughout the combined work. Regrettably, there is no bibliography. Zev Garber, Los Angeles Valley College, Van Nuys, CA 91401</page></plain_text>
