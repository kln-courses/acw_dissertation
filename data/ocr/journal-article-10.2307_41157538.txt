<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cage and Chaos Christopher Shultis ABSTRACT Undoubtedly, "chance operations" play an important part in the composition techniques of John Cage. But which relation did Cage himself see between chaos theory and his body of work? And what connections between Cage and chaos have been drawn by critics of his work? This essay answers these question by taking a close look at the interviews Joan Retallack con- ducted with Cage as well as by examining two of his compositions- Child of Tree and Lecture on the Weather- in terms of "chance operations" and "chaos theory." In this short essay, I will address the following questions: first, what did Cage know about chaos? And second, what do others who have made a con- nection between Cage and chaos have to say? I will consider the second question as I look at two Cage compo- sitions that use what he called "chance operations": Child of Tree and Lecture on the Weather, both of which were written in 1975.1 I will describe what Cage meant by "chance operations" and show how he used them when he composed, as well as considering the nature of the performed result. Chance is a subject addressed by chaos theory and, through a discussion of Cage's use of the word, it may be possible for those knowledgeable about such things to ascertain whether or not Cage's "chance" is the same as found in chaos theory. 1 Child of Tree and Lecture on the Weather were both performed as part of the conference en- titled "Chaos/Control: Complexity" at the Zentrum für interdisziplinäre Forschung, Universität Bielefeld. Lecture, in particular, was a major undertaking and received a brilliant performance by students at the University, including superb technical assistance by the staff at ZiF. Deserving of special mention is Philipp Hofmann, who provided invaluable assistance without which the per- formance would not have been possible.

Those interviews are collected in a book edited by Retallack, enti- tled MUSICAGE, and the subject of chaos occasionally comes up. Here is one in- stance from 7 September 1990, where Retallack and Cage are discussing a text he wrote about Jasper Johns, "Art is Either a Complaint or Do Something Else." Retal- lack: "This whole piece is fragmented ... or rather has a fractal quality- of the sort described in the chapter on Mandelbrot in Chaos." Cage: "Yes, I don't know why I didn't read it all the way through. Well the reason I didn't was that I get involved in too many different things" (Retallack 60). In a footnote, Retallack mentions that she and Cage had, prior to the interview, discussed the James Gleick book as well as Man- delbrot's The Fractal Geometry of Nature. Later, and during the same conversation, af- ter having been asked to comment on his opinion that science could be seen as a cor- roboration of his work, Cage responds: "I was thinking of this book that I haven't read ... the 'chaos' book, you know. It's in the air. We know enough that the book ex- ists. And we think of that as being a kind of corroboration. It makes chance opera- tions seem not foolish, hmm?" (73). Retallack continues by trying to make a connection between the mind of Cage the composer, and the term "strange attractor": "Does the term 'strange attractor' (from chaos theory) mean enough for you to have an opinion on whether the working, com- posing mind is in some sense a strange attractor?" Cage's response: "Oh tell me a little bit about that." Retallack goes on to describe her sense of what a strange attractor is: [It is] generated by a set of nonlinear equations and a computer-time development, you might get a pattern that you can see is a bounded system, but the location of any given point within that system as it develops is unpredictable. The organizing principle in a non- linear pattern like that has been called a strange attractor. Since the human mind is itself a complex system ... I wonder whether in its organizing of experience within certain kinds of complex aesthetic procedures, the artist is allowing the mind to behave as a strange attractor. Cage: "Well, that of course leads toward habit, doesn't it?" Retallack: "Well, it would lead away from habit if it were truly a strange attractor." Cage: "So this would change distinctly from one thing to another?" Retallack: "Yes, it would lead to constant change, though within a bounded system" (Retallack 73-74). Cage reacts to this by telling her about the painter Mark Tobey, who, he says "went in many directions," one of which was his famous "white writing," which appears to be nothing but a blank white canvas until one gets closer and sees that the white is produced by an enormously complex interweaving of lines. Cage then compares Tobey with a retrospective show he had seen of the artist Robert Ryman, where the work, painted over an entire lifetime, was nothing but white put on a variety of mate- rials. What was the connection between the two painters? According to Cage, "the idea [of making white paintings] came to him [Tobey] ... in the same way that it came to Robert Ryman- out of the air, hmm?" (Retallack 75). Now this may seem to be an extremely oblique way around the question; perhaps, one might assume, because Cage clearly had not read Gleick's book and, as such, had no idea- prior to Retallack's description- of what a "strange attractor" was. Retal- lack herself comments to that effect: "So, interestingly, that came to your mind after</page><page sequence="3">Cage and Chaos 93 my talking about the mind as a strange attractor "To which Cage responds: "I re- ally couldn't tell whether the strange attractor was subjective or was 'in the air.' And I don't know whether you mean it to be in one place or the other." To which Retallack later responds: "That's interesting, because I was- I think you picked up on it- I was thinking more in terms of the mind creating the weather patterns rather than being subject to them." Cage: "It could go in one direction or the other" (Retallack 75). This exchange opens up the possibility of what I have elsewhere called "control" and "co-existence," where one either controls their relationship to experience (subjec- tive) or simply co-exists within experience ("in the air").2 These are the two directions Cage alludes to in the above. However, Cage was ultimately not so positive about the equal acceptance of one direction or the other, as one can see in the last reference to chaos in MUSICAGE: an interview conducted on 17 July 1992, less than a month be- fore his death. Retallack says: "A Pythagorean would say they're being connected with the order of the universe. Or if you were a modified, up-to-date Pythagorean- a chaos theorist, say- you could say something similar, only the dynamics of the uni- verse would include both order and disorder: chance." Cage's response: My tendency is not to think of something like the order of the universe. There's something very detailed about music. Everything becomes a detail. Out of the many [my emphasis] it becomes one. I remember as a child those questions they would give us in drugstores. There would be a big jar of jelly beans, and one had to guess how many there were. I remember thinking it would be quite impossible to know how many jelly beans were there, and it wouldn't make any difference whether I said 489 or 496. (Retallack 236) Cage preferred not to think in terms of a larger order, accepting, instead, the com- plex world "as it is." In other words, as it could be directly experienced, regardless of how such experience could be amplified or enlarged via theoretical constructs. He was willing to accept whatever scientific discovery told him, and gladly incorporated it into his world view, just as he gladly accepted the I-Ching as a way of producing random- ness in response to his compositional questions. But he never explored such subjects further, either as a way of testing their validity or as a way of questioning his own sense of how the world works. Cage- like certain of his predecessors, Charles I ves in music, or Thoreau and Emerson in literature, for example- read in many subject ar- eas but never comprehensively. He, like many artists, read to confirm what he already intuited about the world. If there was an order in the universe, if there were patterns behind the chaos, Cage's focus was away from pattern, away from the large view, and toward the chaotic particularity of experiences and of things experienced "as they are," in other words, as we directly experience them rather than how we mediate be- tween experience and our conceptual shaping of it. Cage used what he called "chance operations" to lessen the human tendency to me- diate. Chance operations were, for him, a way of redirecting the control of the compo- sitional mind from the role of master to the category of impetus- through asking questions whose responses are subject to an outside source instead of determining compositional results solely by personal choice. 2 Christopher Shultis, Silencing the Sounded Self: John Cage and the American Experimental Tradition (Boston: Northeastern UP, 1998).</page><page sequence="4">94 Christopher Shultis Child of Tree offers an ideal vantage point by which to learn more about how Cage used chance operations. Written in 1975, the "score" is actually a set of instructions al- lowing performers to build their own musical score. And it is in this regard that a dis- cussion of Cage's connection with chaos must first be addressed: compositional form prior to any performed result. The first instructions concern choosing instruments, all plant materials, and only two specifically required by the composer: a pod rattle and a cactus. The composer also pre-determined by choice the length of the piece: 8 minutes. After all these choices, the first chance operation is a division of the eight-minute piece into parts. To do this, Cage writes out a table (see ex. 2) that divides the 64 I- Ching numbers into 4. He further explains that "if the first 2 or 3 parts total seven minutes, the last part, of course, will be one minute. If the 3rd or 4th part makes a length of 9, or 10, reduce it to a number making a total length of 8" {Child of Tree). The I-Ching uses trigrams that combine in pairs to form hexagrams. Illustration no. 4 is a photocopy of the chart found in the back of Richard Wilhelm's German transla- tion of the I-Ching, and this is the version, translated into English by Cary Baynes, that Cage used. Although he eventually used computer-generated I-Ching numbers, Cage at first threw coins, three at a time to produce these trigrams, working from the bottom up. Using U.S. pennies, heads and what we call tails, correspond to broken and straight lines respectively. Or, according to Cage himself, three coins tossed once yield four lines: three heads, broken with a circle; two tails and a head, straight; two heads and a tail, broken; three tails, straight with a circle . . . three coins tossed six times yield sixty-four hexagrams (two trigrams, the second written above the first) (Silence 57) A circled line, either broken or straight, is a "changing line." When it appears, it cre- ates two hexagrams, not just one, by also, in addition to producing its original, chang- ing that particular line to its opposite, producing a second. fi cnttOunty fintò !*$»*&amp;**&gt; WÊw(j . ,, J i i-Vi »-«-3 TgzL pmmm^ ej Sfatai) M «»M</page><page sequence="5">Cage and Chaos 95 In my current version of Child of Tree, the first hexagram I threw was 58, which, when consulting Cage's table, equals four minutes. The second hexagram was 3, equaling one minute, the third, 1, also equaling one minute. What next? Well, the first time I did this piece, I threw five parts: 3, 1, 1, 1, 2 for a total of eight min- utes. And, if I had thrown another 1, I could have done the same with this ver- sion as well. But that is not what the score intends, at least that is what Cage told me when I corresponded with him about this piece. In a phone conversation, Cage said, actually "bet" me, there could be no more than four parts. When asked why, he specified that once the length of three parts is determined, the fourth part - TRIQ*A&gt;&lt;S ch'ton Chen K'an Ken K'un Sun U Tul uprtw ► == ---s ss -s sr-= =-= LOWE» ^ °!^P 1 34 S 26 11 9 14 43 ?ÎT 25 61 3 27 24 42 21 17 ü™ 6 40294 76964 47 íi_l 33 623962 15 636631 *'UJ! 12 16 8 23 2 20 36 46 !m!. 44 3248 18 4667602t JjL 13 66632236 37 3049 JjjjL 10 64 60 41 19 61 38 68 My lor kfcnttfying tht Hwapm should be whatever time remains equaling the prescribed eight minutes. The score clarifies this in two places, one of which you have already seen in example 2: "If the first 2 or 3 parts total seven minutes, the last part [my emphasis], of course, will be one minute" (Child of Tree). When I pointed out the possibility of five sections, as de- scribed previously, and bet him "double or nothing" that indeed more than four were possible, he sent me a check in reply, dated 27 August 1990, for the following amount: two over zero, double or nothing!

Cage's use of tables narrows the realm of pos- sibility still further by dividing the hexagrams into groups depending upon the number of variables which exist according to Cage's questions. In the case previously addressed, Cage creates a table that, according to him, indicates minutes. This means, since it is a table of four, that no part will be more than four minutes long. It also limits the range of response by having the I-Ching numbers only be applicable to one of four possibilities.</page><page sequence="6">96 Christopher Shultis CbiM of Tree (Shuitis transcription. 1991) percussion sob Page 3 Other plant materials requiring ampiulcation may be used foltowing experimentation together (and) with altered ptant materials not requiring ampüßation.

Reserving the 10* instr. for the last part, ascertain by means of the com oracle of the l- Ching how many and which of the remaining 9 instruments arc used in the Page 5. other part (s). The rest of the piece does similar things by using tables with up to nine possible divisions. This process strikes me as being full of choices that far outweigh its uses of chance. The instruments are specified by either composer or performer and, as discussed, the questions that determine formal di- visions as well as what goes where, using the same process but not dis- cussed, are pre-determined by the composer as well. Whatever role chance plays in Child of Tree, its predominance is not in the area of compositional form or structure. It is, instead, in the area of perform- ance that this piece- and others like it- provides a connection be- tween Cage's work and chance. And the performance begins, in a way sure to be appreciated by lit- erary scholars, with the interpreters attempt to read- or better yet, translate- the score in order to create the structure in which the piece is performed. In one of my last letters to Cage on this subject, I told him that I planned to type out a "short-hand" version of Child of Tree, minus all the crossed-out subtractions while leaving in only what remained along with whatever additions Cage made as he wrote the instructions. His response: "Please include a facsimile page showing how the score was made (so that it is not easy to understand). This doesn't mean that you shouldn't clarify it."3 I cannot answer as to whether chance operations, like those used in Child of Tree, produce a result that works in ways similar to the scientific use of the term, particu- larly as it is addressed in chaos theory. However, I believe the instructions themselves, due simply to their "chaotic" nature, will generate a result in which chance is a partici- pant. For example, Cage said on the telephone that there could be only four parts, and I can see his justification by using the table of four as he said it should be used. How- ever, I can also then see it as indicating parts, so that one would throw coins to deter- mine first how many parts there are (one through four). One could then throw coins again to determine how long each of those parts would be. However, Cage, respond- ing by letter, saw the process as one operation, so that numbers one through four de- termined only minutes rather than parts. But, if one uses minutes, it is then possible to have more than four parts, unless one reads the previously mentioned instructions: "If the first 2 or 3 parts total seven minutes, the last part, of course, will be one minute." 3 Private correspondence, 8 August 1990.</page><page sequence="7">Cage and Chaos 97 Seems vague and uncertain, sounds a bit as the score itself looks? Was Cage per- haps trying to intentionally make the score "not easy to understand"? I think so. And it is not without irony that the choices Cage makes produce the greatest amount of chaos and chance. And finally, to further complicate matters (not an inappropriate task at a conference on complexity), Cage's final instructions are as follows: "using a stop-watch, the soloist improvises clarifying the time structure by means of the instru- ments. This improvisation is the performance" (Child of Tree). In other words, Cage's final decision as a composer, his last use of compositional control, is to relinquish con- trol of the work's contents. Determined form, using chance operations, is filled with indeterminately improvised content. Is that not remarkably paradoxical? N. Katherine Hayles thought so, as can be seen in a recent essay entitled "Chance Operations: Cagean Paradox and Contemporary Science": "On the one hand, we have that which exceeds or escapes our designs, chance; and on the other an operation, which is the process by which we put our designs into effect. What does it mean, then, to have a chance operation?" Hayles then, drawing upon her work "on randomness, chaos, and noise in scientific contexts," suggests "three interpretations of chance that present it as a concept that can be enacted through an operation" (Hayles 226). These three interpretations are as follows: 1) The intersection of independent causal chains. This can be seen at the most basic level as the conjunction (rather than connection, which implies relationship) between a composer's decision-making, a performer's decision-making, and the consultation of the I-Ching as part of those processes. In Child of Tree, each functions independently, but in performance, intersection occurs. On the other hand, as Hayles writes, "the point is not to deny connection, since conjunction is a kind of connection. Rather it is to subvert the anthropomorphic perspective that constructs continuity from a human vantage point of control and isolation" (228). The independent elements co-exist equally with none in particular controlling the other. 2) Temporality. According to Hayles, "the configuration of the I-Ching sticks is de- termined by chance, but once the throw has been made, chance has spoken and its dictates must be obeyed" (231). In Child of Tree, temporality finds its way into every area, be it the decisions of the composer concerning instrument choices, the decisions concerning what questions will be asked to determine form, and, finally, the impro- vised performance itself. This kind of temporality produces a result that Hayles re- gards as an example of "fractal time." Fractals, according to Hayles, "are complex symmetrical forms that repeat themselves across every available scale but always with variations that never resolve at any scale into simpler forms." She then writes that "before the phrase 'fractal time' existed, Cage was arguing for it in music Cage envisions the time in which the sounds come together in chance conjunctions to be as rich and various as the worldlines generating this fractal complexity" (233-35). All things are individually and differently fixed, but, at the end of a performance of Child of Tree, it is clear that what has been heard and seen can never be exactly repeated or duplicated. Which leads to Hayles's third interpretation: 3) Noncompressibility. Hayles views Cage's use of chance in the context of numeri- cal randomness. She then discusses how one determines whether or not a number is random:</page><page sequence="8">98 Christopher Shultis If the number has a pattern, this pattern can be expressed in abstract form, which is to say that an economical algorithm can be created to generate it. But when a number is random, no such pattern exists. The most economical way to describe it, is simply to pro- vide a copy of it. Randomness thus implies noncompressibility (240) She goes on to write that, although incompressibility "is characteristic of any po- etry"- and such can be said of music as well- by creating works that incorporate ran- domness, "Cage intensifies the incompressibility of poetic language" (235-36). She concludes her essay with the following, which could also serve as a description of Child of Tree: In his chance operations, Cage performs nothing less than the directionality of time and the complexity of its flow, the paradox of randomness as maximum information, and the entanglement of causal determinism with an open and unpredictable future. (240) An apt conclusion to a discussion on Cage and Chaos is Cage's Lecture on the Weather. Both Joan Retallack and Marjorie Perloff have written about this piece, Per- loff in her 1990 book Radical Artifice, and Retallack in an essay written between 1992 and 1994 entitled "Poethics of a Complex Realism." Both also consider Lecture on the Weather in reference to certain aspects of chaos theory. In what follows, I will briefly describe the piece and their published reactions to it, after which, readers can decide for themselves whether the "weather" of Cage is the weather of chaos. Lecture on the Weather was written "for twelve speaker-vocalists (or instrumental- ists), preferably [though not necessarily] American men who have become Canadian citizens, each using his own sound system, each sound system given an equalization distinguishing it from the others." Each speaker reads from a part that consists of texts by Henry David Thoreau and "using this material, the speaker-vocalist makes a program of activity and inactivity such that it will fill an agreed-upon time length which is at least 22'45" (5 x 4'33") and not more than 36'24 " (8 x 4*33 ")." Recordings of breeze, rain, and thunder by Maryanne Amacher and a film made by Luis Fran- gella, "representing lightning by means of briefly projected negative drawings by Thoreau," are also part of the piece, the combined results of which seem remarkably like a "real" thunderstorm. Thoreau's texts, according to Cage, "were not selected to stress any particular points, but were obtained by means of I-Ching chance operations from Waiden, from the Journal, and from the Essay on Civil Disobedience" ("Preface" 4). The length of the piece is determined by multiplying from 5 to 8 times the length of Cage's famous silent piece, 4*33" (1952). This combination of silence and chance and the possible connection between the two did not go unremarked by Cage: Chance operations are not mysterious sources of 'the right answers.' They are a means of locating a single one among a multiplicity of answers, and, at the same time, of freeing the ego from its taste and memory, its concern for profit and power, of silencing the ego so that the rest of the world has a chance to enter into the ego's own experience whether that be outside or inside. ("Preface" 5) According to Marjorie Perloff, in Lecture on the Weather "the chance operation, in this context, is more properly understood as a form of constraint, a rule-generated process within which 'weather conditions' occur." Later in the same essay, Perloff re- marks that</page><page sequence="9">Cage and Chaos 99 no single version of Lecture on the Weather . . . can thus claim the authority of repre- senting the 'real' Cage text, which therefore functions as a score-to-be-activated rather than as an art object to be replicated. Or, to put it in terms of chaos theory, which has many applications to Cage's work, the performance functions as a 'strange attractor' or 'unpredictable system,' which 'collapses to a point' at 'a single instant in time,' only to change, 'ever so slightly,' at the next instant. (24) Perloff is, at the end, citing a letter written to her by Joan Retallack, whom she says first suggested "the analogy between Cage's structure and a 'strange attractor'" (23). This brings us back to the beginning, where Retallack also first suggests the analogy to Cage (she first broached the subject with Hayles as well).4 Retallack witnessed an amazing performance, that I also attended, of Lecture on the Weather in Strathmore, MD. Just as the piece began, doors were open to the outside where a storm began to be audible and visible (thunder and lightning and then torrential rain) this had the interesting effect of eradicating the distinction between 'inside' and 'outside'- the meteorological display over Strath- more Hall was continuous with that going on in the room where Cage's more gentle storm included the weather of predetermined and coincidental conjunctions of sound and voice variables; words, ideas, and silences that form, among other things, the complex sys- tems of political climates. ("Poethics" 248) However, there is one distinction, I think, that should be made between the storm Cage creates on the inside and the actual storm occurring outside those doors. And this is related to Retallack's characterization of Cage's storm as being "more gentle." Storms in the real world are potentially dangerous. And nature, unassisted by human interaction, is a neutral force capable equally of both goodness and harm. In her essay "Poethics of a Complex Realism," Retallack compares Cage with Ed- ward Lorenz: Both Cage and Lorenz developed models for allowing numbers to enact random ele- ments in nature's processes. But the scientist and the artist diverge in interesting ways. While Lorenz and his colleagues have been primarily interested in finding the orderly patterns in chaos by creating self-contained models which generate broadly repetitive forms delimiting local randomness, Cage . . . was most interested in the nonperiodic as- pects of chaos, that is, the local randomness- by making available to our attention a space-time and materially delimited experience of the play of randomness he referred to as 'chance.' (251) The reasons behind such difference are simple; the goals, as a consequence, are oppo- site. Lorenz, the meteorologist, is trying to learn more about weather in order to per- haps improve the ability to predict, or perhaps understand better in order to control, weather that can as often be dangerous as it is gentle. Cage, the composer, on the other hand, need not fear the results of his "chance operations" since, in the world of art, no weather is too stormy. And that is why in a performance of Lecture on the Weather the audience is in the laboratory, not the natural world. As Marjorie Perloff notes, ... at its best, such construction empowers the audience by altering its perceptions of how things happen. Thus, even though a work like Lecture on the Weather is a collage of found texts- extracts from Thoreau, replicas of bird calls, recordings of thunder- its 'weather' is charged with possibilities. (28) 4 Private correspondence, 5 June 1998.</page><page sequence="10">100 Christopher Shultis 'Accessibility' has rarely been a word attached to any discussion of John Cage. But if there is a connection between chaos theory and Lecture on the Weather- and much more work can be done to determine whether or not such is the case (especially by music theorists who can address both music and mathematics)- its usefulness may very well lie in its relative accessibility compared to its more fearsome natural coun- terpart. One can rest assured that, during a performance of the "storm" called Lecture on the Weather, the audience will remain safely in their seats. And those guarantees are only possible in the laboratory called 'art.' Whether Cage understood anything about chaos theory- and it is doubtful that he pursued it much beyond what Retallack and he discussed- one thing is certain and it provides at least this one point of comparison, with which I will close, between Cage and chaos as practiced in the sciences: Cage preferred that it remain chaotic- that the world would be a better place if it could exist beyond our omnipotent and total con- trol. The idea of somehow "controlling" chaos was beyond the aesthetics- or what Joan Retallack has called the "poethics"- that Cage practiced throughout his life. Works Cited Cage, John. Child of Tree.
