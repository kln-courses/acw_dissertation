<plain_text><page sequence="1">John G. Parks Miami University, Ohio The Grace of Suffering: The Fiction of Edward Lewis Wallant After his release from jail for a crime he did not commit, though he could indeed imagine himself commiting it, Samuel Abel Kahan, the manic clown character of the novel The Children at the Gate, expresses what can serve as the keynote of the fiction of Edward Lewis Wallant: "It's so lonely not to suffer, so lonely." His fiction shows that it is only through suffering that we can discover our full humanity. Each of his four published novels portrays a character seeking escape or insulation from the world of pain and suffering, discovering that attempt to be futile and deadening, thus leaving him with a vulnerability requisite to the rediscovery of human solidarity. While Wallanťs fiction is affir- mative of human regeneration and joy, it offers no glib certainties ar- rived at syllogistically. It is a fiction that faces squarely the enormities of our age - the loss of traditional absolutes, the genocidal terrors, the general malaise of urban mass society. Wallanťs four novels, as Jonathan Baumbach writes in The Landscape of Nightmare, "are dark visions of disquieting, often apocalyptic seriousness, haunting, desolating books about the improbable possibilities of redemption in a corrosively malignant world. Each of Wallanťs books is a kind of pilgrim's progress about those blighted innocents, who damned to disbelief, keep vigil at the gate." With the vertical dimension severed, the 111</page><page sequence="2">The Grace of Suffering horizontal is yet at our disposal: it is to the awesome miracle of being human that Wallanťs fiction calls attention. In The Human Season (1960), Wallanťs first novel, we are taken on a journey into the soul of a man in grief. The death of his wife of over 30 years is more than Joseph Berman can take- it is the final blow, among many he has sustained in his life, destroying everything he has ever believed in and leaving him alone, bereft of purpose and hope, and near despair. The God of his father, whom he has loved and to whom he has prayed all his life, is cast as his enemy, deserving only his scorn and curses. This contemporary Job resists all consolation offered by family and friends, refuses to listen to the pious ministrations of the visiting rab- bi, and determines to find out things for himself. Berman puts his life on trial, summoning through dream and memory, persons and events of his life to testify, to see if his past possesses life-giving, life-redeeming force to vindicate a present now destitute of meaning and worth. In his dreams he recalls the moments of his courtship of his wife when he promises, "all I know is I would do everything for you as long as I live and nothing would be too much for me. I know how to suffer; I would suffer any pain for you. ..." While his grief and remorse test the depth of that promise, his dreams reveal the bitter-sweet admixture of his life's experiences - the illnesses and deaths, the moments of joy and ex- hilaration. Like Wordsworth's "spots of time," Berman rediscovers moments of invulnerable joy from his youth, when "his heart sang with that mysterious exaltation that had no basis in reason, no foundation of motive or history," holding him in an "odd transcendence," which seemed "the overpowering evidence, irrefutable, of some towering presence." And the deepest layer of dream evokes the true "towering presence" in his life, his father in Russia, a huge man of unshakeable faith, with whom Berman experienced something mysterious and won- drous about life. While his dreams probe the fullness of his life's experiences, Berman comes to the realization that only an emptiness greeted his curses - there was no one there to hear, nothing. Retaining "old reflexes of the spirit," Berman nevertheless sees that "there was no Enemy, no Betrayer, no bearded Torturer. ..." Now, freed from the anthropomorphic God, and filled with a new courage, Berman must decide whether the awareness of nothingness invalidates the value of what his memory revealed to him. After walking the city streets and observing people in all their strange particularity, Berman realizes the perisistence of the human dream. It is that to which our lives bear witness. The past has resources to redeem the 112</page><page sequence="3">John Parks present. Giving up his hermitage of grief and despair and agreeing to live with his daughter, Berman comes to a final insight: He had no words then for the thing he was sure of. ... But he phrased it in the hidden eloquence of his brain. Answers come in little glimmers to your soul, most clearly in childhood, in the sounds of certain voices and faces and things, when you feel the miracle and wonder; and he knew then that the Torahs and prayer shawls and churches and saints were just the art men tried to create to express the other deeper feeling. "It's like a light that don't last long enough to recognize anything. But the light itself, just that you seen it ... that's got to be enough. ..." And then more emphatically, almost desperately, for it was his last hope: "It is enough!" The "other deeper feeling," enhanced and preserved through memory, opens possibilities for regeneration to Joseph Berman, but not so to Sol Nazerman, the protagonist of Wallant's next novel. In The Pawnbroker (1961) Wallant depicts a survivor of hell whose past offers no saving moments - to Sol Nazerman, memory is nightmare and history is horror. In the German death camps he witnessed, helpless- ly, the slaughter of his family and friends and thousands of others. The former professor at the University of Cracow now runs a pawnshop to launder money from his boss's many illicit enterprises. Sol asks no ques- tions. He is content to let the world do as it pleases, he is indifferent to it, he does not care any more. He lost his ability to feel years ago. Con- science and morality are things of the past, and the past is dead. He lives only for the present moment, and values only his privacy. Thus, one of the overriding questions of the novel is how, if at all, the ravages of human history can be salvaged. If history has been a debacle, what pros- pects are there for hope and regeneration. The pawnbroker pays a great spiritual price for his survival in in- sulation from human involvement. The shell he erects to protect himself from human penetration also prevents him from feeling and taking responsibility for his feelings. But, as in all of Wallant's fiction, such a program is doomed to failure. Sol does not live in a void. At home he must endure the bickering of his sister's family. At work he faces at his counter the countless numbers of the earth's wretched: pimps, junkies, whores, alkies, the poor, the lonely. With them he barters, argues, assays, passes judgments. He sees himself as a kind of priest dispensing through his loans a momentary reprieve from life's implacable demands. Wallant shows himself a master of vignette in his vivid portrayal of the 113</page><page sequence="4">The Grace of Suffering many lost, lonely, and broken people who come to the pawnbroker's window. The unending stream of such grotesques begin to wear upon the obdurate shell of the pawnbroker. He thought all human life had been gassed and cremated years ago. He asks, "What was this whole ghastly parade about? And why was he forced to endure it?" But it is the appropriately and ironically named assistant, Jesus Or- tiz, who is the instrument of Sol's regeneration from his death-in-life ex- istence. Jesus, fatherless, is mysteriously drawn to the inscrutable Jew with the strange blue tattoo on his arm. As the pawnbroker's apprentice, he waits on Sol's every word and hopes for some revelation of the secret of mercantile success. Blinded by his rancor and cynicism, all that Sol can give his student is his nihilism. Telling Jesus that next to the speed of light, money is the nearest thing we have to an absolute, Sol sets into mo- tion a train of events which leads to an attempted robbery and Jesus' sacrificial death. If the teacher fails the student, the student does not fail the teacher, for Jesus' death is the occasion for the pawnbroker's resur- rection from his spiritual death: So he was caught in the flow of them as he tried to find the wellspring of his own tears. Until he realized he was crying for all his dead now, that all the dammed-up weeping had been released by the loss of one irreplaceable Negro who has been his assistant and who had tried to kill him but who had ended by saving him. One more death, given in ironic love, teaches the teacher what he had forgotten he knew. Self-imprisoned no longer, washed by his grief, Sol Nazerman is free now to love those whom he had despised and blindly exploited. The pawnshop, filled with the "odd flotsam of people's lives," is a fitting metaphor for a world so mindlessly in pursuit of material success. From a Harlem pawnshop, Wallant moves to a modern hospital for the locus of the action in his third novel The Children at the Gate (1964). It is a fitting setting for the conflict between efficiency and compassion, between scientific and spiritual values embodied in the two main characters. Angelo DeMarco is a self-made intellectual, a man of reason, logic and science, for whom religion is a ghost story woven out of human fear and ignorance. His foil is Sammy Abel Kahan, a man of feeling, passion and compassion, for whom human life is mysterious and beyond reason. Angelo cannot readily account for the likes of Sammy within his neat, rational categories; to Angelo Sammy is a kook, a mental case. But Sammy carries the burden of suffering on the behalf of, sometimes in place of, and very often because of, the kind of man Angelo represents. Sometimes the man of feeling and passion can overcome the man of 114</page><page sequence="5">John Parks reason through his weakness and suffering and death. This the man of reason cannot explain. As opposites, they attract. To Sammy, the wandering Jew, Angelo is his latest project, a man who must be shown how absurd his rationality is and how ineffably beautiful human life is. To Angelo, Sammy is inex- plicably compelling, and, despite himself, he joins the other orderlies, Howard Miller and Lebedov, in the solarium to listen to Sammy's stories. And such stories! His tales, told one after the other, are in- variably about some inexplicable human incident - parables of suffering, love and sacrificial death, "horrible and funny, sad and obscene." These stories capture Angelo 's attention, they divert him from his analytic and empirical posture, and begin to break through his protective shell. Sam- my seeks for the one joke that will truly break Angelo up. When one of the children in the hospital is molested and dies, both Howard Miller and Sammy are arrested. But Lebedov, the old Russian orderly, confesses and is taken into custody. After Sammy is released, he is given back his job, and begins to circulate a petition calling upon everyone to forgive Lebedov. He tells Angelo: ". . . What they need is a big, big, tremendous joke to make them see the one little thing . . . that . . . How can they ... No, but they got to remember Lebedov. He's a human- that's all there should be. There shouldn't be anything else but people on this earth." But Angelo recoils from Sammy' persistence and madness, and betrays the story-teller to the hospital authorities for giving drugs to patients. Sammy approaches the child's grief-stricken parents on the steps of the hospital and asks them to forgive Lebedov. Receiving a slight shove, Sammy falls backward and is impaled upon an ornate, decorative spear at the foot of the stairs- the comic Christ enacts his biggest and last joke, which Angelo witnesses and then collapses into hysterical and con- vulsive laughter. When Angelo recovers from his breakdown, he learns that he is the beneficiary of Sammy's insurance policy. But the apprentice offers a much richer legacy, for Sammy has restored Angelo to the human com- munity. Leaving home in April, Angelo remembers the day Sammy died: And a blade twitched into his heart, beginning that slow, massive bleeding he would never be able to stop, no matter what else he might accomplish. He was surprised and puzzled as he walked with that mortal wound in him, for it occurred to him that, although the wound would be the death of him, it would be the life of him too. 115</page><page sequence="6">The Grace of Suffering The absurd man, the man of passion has overcome the rational man, the man of logic. Story has defeated the laboratory. Sammy's actions recall Dostoyevsky's words, from Notes from Underground, that "the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano key!" From Sammy, Angelo learns the grace of suffering. In The Tenants of Moonbloom (1963), the novelist takes us on another tour, this time into the decrepit innards of four inner-city tene- ment houses, which are presided over by another one of Wallanťs avoiders of human involvement, another figure seeking insulation from human penetration. In contrast to the somber tone of the first three novels, this one is comic and celebrative. Like all of Wallanťs heroes, the quixotic and Chaplinesque Norman Moonbloom is a failure in his quest to preserve his isolation. But, of course, such a failure is a precondition for his success in becoming human. After squandering his grandfather's inheritance by attending college for fourteen years, Norman Moonbloom works as the rent collector for his prosperous brother Irwin. Norman is a daydreamer and he loves his solitude. His life is a kind of suspended animation. He feels as though he is living inside a block of ice, hopeful yet fearful of a thaw. At one point, Norman notes: He was out of it, or had never been it it; an invisible placenta allowed him to move at his own speed. His stomach was used to food prepared for mass lack of taste. By life-long habit, he heard but did not listen, just as he saw but did not look. Like a cautious mouse in an electrified maze, he remembered his few tentative sorties toward things, his few brief adventures into the barest hint of pain. He kept to a small circumference now, having experienced nothing that compensated for the discomfort of sen- sation. When he asked himself what his life meant, his invariable answer was, evasively, "It doesn't mean anything; it is." In Norman we see one of the major questions the novel is asking, a ques- tion posed in passion by Hamlet, another great avoider: "What is a man, if his chief good and market of his time be but sleep and feed? a beast no more." It is a motley bunch that peoples Moonbloom's tenements. They form that great silent mass that lives on the raveled edges of society. They are anonymous and only marginally related to one another. We meet those with lingering hopes, secret longings, dreams and illusions, burning rage, shaky or missing dignity, open lusts and quiet desperation. Each has a story to tell, if someone would listen. Each yearns for some 116</page><page sequence="7">John Parks recognition and affirmation of his dignity and worth. But Norman finds them loathesome and despicable, despising their every cry and gesture. They make him a witness to their sufferings, longings and battles. Many, seeing Norman as an indifferent robot, a walking cadaver, would pur- posely needle him. They wear him down; they infiltrate his defenses with their irresistible humanity. And, as in all of Wallanťs novels, breakdown is the prerequisite to breakthrough. It is Norman's fate to be "lost in a forest of lives," and "cast into the inferno of people." And after a hilarious sexual baptism by the sen- suous Sheryl Beeler, Norman prepares for the conquest of the tenements - he vows to clean and repair everything himself. In his new role as handyman he is exposed to even greater intimacies. Norman is an apprentice at being human and he has much to learn. From Betty Jacoby Norman learns: "People carry on so about love and hatred- what is so much worse, so much more a burden, is tenderness and pity. Even grief is nothing beside those things." From Sugarman the candy butcher, Nor- man learns: "There's a Trinity of Survival, and consists of Courage, Dream, and Love," and that "he who possesses all three, or two, or at least one of these wins whatever there is to win; those who lack all three are the failures. . . ."At each apartment a new revelation awaits the awestruck pupil who feels like "an ear of God." Norman knows that all his repairs will have no real effect on the salvaging of the tenants' lives, but he does them anyway to see what it all means for him. And in a wonderfully comic scene at the end, Norman is fully baptized in the act of repairing the swollen wall in Basellecci's toilet. His baptism by an excremental splash is appropriate for the former great avoider, for now he is sullied and is now truly part of the great unwashed mass of humanity. It occurs to Norman that "there was only one hope for him, and for all people who had lost, through in- telligence, the hope of immortality. 'We must love and delight in each other and in ourselves!' he cried." Does such activity imply, as Jonathan Baumbach suggests, that if sanity is unconcern, then being fully human is madness? The Tenants of Moonbloom is not the only recent novel to raise such an implication. All of Wallanťs sonless fathers and fatherless sons undergo an ap- prenticeship of pain before discovering a brotherhood and sisterhood that makes their lives meaningful. One cannot be human and avoid pain or anguish. As Norman Moonbloom realizes, "joy resembled mourning and was, if anything, just as powerful and profound." Wallanťs work is an artistic brief for a truly human world. It is fiction painful to write, as he once said of his writing: 117</page><page sequence="8">The Grace of Suffering To say that I enjoy writing would be less a mistake of degree than of species. I sweat and ache and writhe in my chair; it is decidedly not in the nature of a relaxing hobby. Why do I write then? I don't know exactly, only that I must do it. It no longer seems to be my free choice. I do not write to entertain myself and others (although there may sometimes happily be entertainment in my writing). I write to share my views and feelings of the lives of human beings. . . . However a writer can illuminate the human condition, so must he do it. {Library Journal, LXXXV, June 1, 1960, 2204) Wallanťs is a fiction which calls the reader to attention. To suffer, to feel pain, is to be at attention, to be able to notice things. As Sammy, from The Children at the Gate, explains his approach to people: "It's that I get them to really pay attention that way. See, when they're a little sore and curious, I can find out more about them. People have to get ... well . . . Like you rub your skin against something rough - you know, scrape yourself. Your skin gets tender, you feel every little thing - a breeze, a little brushing against it. ... It's like I can see their nerves. ..." And once a work of art captures our attention - why, then, almost anything is possible. 118</page></plain_text>
