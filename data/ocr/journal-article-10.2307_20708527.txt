<plain_text><page sequence="1">John H. Lavely Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter Since we are, at this meeting, observing the fiftieth anniversary of the Personalistic Discussion Group (henceforth, PDG), I have decided to begin with some A. Historical Notes on the PDG According to Vol. XII of the Proceedings and Addresses of The American Philophical Association for 1938, the 38th Annual meeting of the Eastern Division of the A.P.A. was held at Wesleyan University, Middleton, CT, December 28-30, 1938.1 C.J. Ducasse is listed as president. George H. Sabine's presidential address is included. Among the other participants in the program are Werner Jaeger, W.D. Ross, Richard Hocking, Maurice Mandelbaum, A.O. Lovejoy, John Wild, Sidney Hook, and J.H. Randall, Jr. The membership list contained the names of E.S. Brightman, Peter A. Bertocci, L. Harold DeWolf, Walter G. Muelder, Jannette E. Newhall, and, I might add, my father, Horace T. Lavely. Incidentally, A.N. Whitehead, W.E. Hocking, and W.V.O. Quine were among other members. One looks in vain, however, for any mention of the PDG in the 1938 Proceedings. We must seek, therefore, other evidence of our beginnings. I can find no reason, mnemonic, documentary, or testi mony of other people, to believe that I attended this first session, though it would have been possible. I had come to Boston in Septem ber, about ten days before the great hurricane of September 21, 1938, to attend Boston University School of Theology. But I had not yet begun keeping a yearly date book, as I did soon after. Hence, I cannot verify where I spent the Christmas vacation of 1938. My 21</page><page sequence="2">22 John H. Lavely father, who often attended the A.P.A. meetings, could have told me whether he or I had gone to the Wesley an meeting in 1938 if I had asked him this question before his death some twenty years ago. The reason it is not out of the question that I would have attended the 1938 A.P.A. meeting is that I had, in fact, already been to an earlier meeting. I remember clearly that during my junior year at Allegheny College (in Meadville, PA) my father, who taught at Allegheny, invited me to accompany him to Philadelphia for the 1936 meeting of the A.P.A. and I did. What lured my father, a great admirer of Edgar Brightman, to drive all the way across Pennsylvania was that this was the session at which Brightman gave his address as president of the Eastern Division of the A.P.A. This was, of course, "An Empirical Approach to God?"2 I can remember vividly listening attentively to Brightman's presentation and thinking "What a long introduction!" I saw, as the argument developed, the importance of that introductory context. To return to 1938, it is probable that among Edgar Brightman's papers and correspondence there is some reference to the beginnings of the PDG, but I have not come across it. I would be grateful to have such documentation. There are, however, at least two of Brightman's students who attended the first session of the PDG and with whom I have talked. They are Peter A. Bertocci, who later succeeded Brightman as Borden Parker Bowne Professor of Philosophy at Boston University, and Walter G. Muelder, who served for many years as Dean of Boston University School of Theology. Both had had close association with Brightman for several years before 1938.3 I have profited from talking with both of them about the beginning of the PDG. Muelder recalls going to Wesley an for the 1938 A.P.A. meeting from Berea College where he was then teaching to consult with Laurence Sears about The Development of American Philosophy,4 which they were jointly editing. Muelder also counted on discussions with Brightman. He recalls that nearly everyone at the meeting was still talking about the great hurricane of September 21, 1938. Muelder defers to Bertocci's more detailed recollections of the first PDG session.</page><page sequence="3">Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter 23 The PDG did hold its first meeting in December 1938. In fact, according to Bertocci, it was the first special group held in conjunc tion with the Eastern Division of the A.P.A. When one considers that in the 1938 Eastern Division condensed program there are fifty-four group meetings scheduled, one can appreciate what the PDG pioneered. Bertocci has good reason to remember the subject of the first PDG meeting. It was his just-published book, The Empirical Argument for God in Late British Thought. The selection of this topic grew out of Brightman's desire to continue discussion with Bertocci about the book and to have others join in the discussion. Even before the subject was chosen Brightman had talked with Bertocci as well as Dr. Jannette Newhall, another of Brightman's Ph.D.'s and later librarian for many years at Boston University School of Theology, about whether it was really a good thing to initiate such a group. It was agreed that if the group could avoid becoming doctrinaire or establishing a platform, that if the group were kept open to wide participation and hospitable to different perspectives, then the venture would be worthwhile. Anyone who takes the trouble to peruse the list of speakers and their topics over the years can decide for himself/herself whether the PDG has carried out the original intent. Bertocci commented that five years after the start of the PDG John Wild organized a group devoted to realistic philosophy, one which Bertocci said was much more rigid than the PDG. It is Bertocci's recollection that about a dozen people attended the first meeting. In addition to those already mentioned (Brightman, Bertocci, Muelder, Newhall), Bertocci named Julius Seelye Bixler, Jared Sparks Moore, and F. Gerald Ensley among those he believes were there. That leaves four or five unaccounted for. If anyone has information about others who attended the 1938 PDG meeting, I would very much like to learn the names. There seems to be no record of the topic or the speaker for the meetings from 1939 through 1945 except for 1940 when Jared Sparks Moore presented "Theses on Personalism" for discussion. Two early meetings dealt with basic definitions: Brightman, in 1946, on "Some Definitions for Personalists" and Moore again,</page><page sequence="4">24 John H. Lately in 1948, on "Personalist Definitions for Discussion." Both of these were published in The Personalist. Remarkably we have a record of the title of the paper and the speaker for every other meeting of the PDG from 1949 to the present. (The 1947 meeting is the only one other than those mentioned above unaccounted for.) The papers for 1956 through 1962, and the paper for 1965, were pub lished in The Philosophical Forum during the years when I hap pened to be its editor. During the decade of the 70's all but two of the papers were published in Idealistic Studies, then edited by Robert N. Beck. It is fitting that a volume consisting of selected papers presented at the PDG during its first fifty years is being prepared for publica tion. The book, tentatively titled Personalism Revisited: Its Propon ents and Critics, is being edited by Harold H. Oliver of Boston University. These historical notes will appear in this book as an epilogue. The book will also contain an appendix listing nearly all the papers and the speakers, including specific bibliographical details of their initial publication. I began by calling this section historical notes on the PDG. The reason I called it "historical notes" is that there is not space or need for a full-fledged account of the fifty sessions of the PDG. Someone who had attended all fifty sessions might be in a position to com ment on several which she/he felt were especially noteworthy. I think I have possibly attended as many sessions of the PDG as any one except perhaps Brightman and Bertocci. Even so I would hesitate to select distinctive meetings for attention. Furthermore, I doubt if such an attempt would add very much to the story of Personalism. The volume referred to in the preceding paragraph will more ade quately preserve some of the more distinctive papers first presented at the PDG. It seems sufficient, therefore, to describe briefly the format and procedures that have been consistently followed from early in the history of the PDG to the present. The PDG has always been organized very informally, to put it mildly. Its program has consisted exclusively in one meeting a year in conjunction with the Eastern Division of the A.P.A.5 No officers were ever elected and no business meetings were ever held. Its</page><page sequence="5">Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter 25 meetings were open to anyone who wished to attend. Its member ship was a stack of 3 5 cards compiled from the names of those who signed the sheet(s) passed around at the meetings and the names of those whom any attender of the meetings thought would be in terested and hence invited to the meetings. In the first few years Brightman, after consultation with a col league and/or a former student, would select a speaker and invite him/her to prepare a paper on an agreed-upon topic. The paper was usually distributed to the "membership" ahead of time. The speaker then merely summarized the paper and a critic made some com ments, following which the bulk of the meeting was devoted to dis cussion. When Bertocci returned to Boston University in the fall of 1944 to teach in the Department with Brightman, he very soon became the de facto secretary-treasurer, his duties consisted in arranging for a speaker and commentator, mailing out the paper along with a notice of the place and time of the meeting and an invitation to contribute a dollar or two to help defray the cost of distributing the paper. No other "dues" were ever collected. Bertocci served in this capacity until his retirement in 1975. Since then I and Erazim Kohak have in turn followed the pattern which Brightman and Bertocci estab lished. In 1986 Thomas Buford of Furman University assumed the role of secretary-treasurer. Over the years attendance at the meetings fluctuated a good bit. Even in the years when the attendance was lowest, there was never any thought of giving up the enterprise. Indeed, the PDG has con tinued to justify its purpose. I cannot conclude these historical notes without giving attention to the PDG which meets in conjunction with the Central Division of the A.P.A. This PDG has essentially been modeled after the Eastern Division PDG but it is supervised independently and has for the most part a separate constituency. The original PDG has welcomed this extension to the Central Division of the A.P.A. It is probably correct to say that the Central Division PDG gained its impetus and many of its participants from some of Brightman's and Bertocci's Ph.D.'s. So far as I can learn,6 the</page><page sequence="6">26 John H. Lavely Central Division PDG was first arranged for and promoted by Arthur W. M?nk, then at Albion College, and Carrol D. Hildebrand, then at DePauw University. In a recent letter to me, Loyd D. Easton of Ohio Wesleyan University recalls presenting his paper on "E.S. Brightman's Basic Rationalism" at a meeting of the Central Division PDG, but he does not remember where or when. Since Easton's paper was published in Volume 14 of The Philosophical Forum in 1956, it was probably presented at the PDG in 1954 or 1955. Furthermore, a session of the PDG was held in conjunction with the A P.A (Central Division) meeting at Indiana University in the spring of 1956. Discussion of a new book at the time by Errol Harris was led by Warren Steinkraus7 and Tyler Thompson. In 1957, Laurence J. LaFleur was the speaker at the PDG meeting. A memorable session was held in 1959 when the Central Division of the A.P.A. met at Madison, WI. The PDG meeting was held after the Smoker at 11 P.M.! The program was a debate/dialogue between Henry Nelson Wieman and Peter Bertocci on Creativity and God. Beginning about 1970 Bernard Gendr?au of Xavier University took over the planning and arranging of the meetings. Late in the 1970's, a committee composed of Jack Padgett and Albion College, John Howie of Southern Illinois, and Thomas Buford of Furman University took over the responsibility for the PDG meetings. Since the early 1980's Buford has accepted the responsibility for planning the programs and arranging for the meetings. Not much later, as I have noted above, Buford assumed the same role for the Eastern Division PDG. It is well worth noting, that in its 50th year the PDG became international by having a special session at the 18th World Congress of Philosophy in Brighton, England, August 1988. It was arranged by Thomas Buford, who presented a paper on the theme of the PDG meeting, "Personalism: New Directions." Harold H. Oliver of Boston University made a presentation on "Relational Personalism." Jack Padgett of Albion College was the commentator. B. Personalism's Earlier History The PDG is in a sense a microcosm of the Personalist tradition. Personalism has never been a dominant philosophical movement.</page><page sequence="7">Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter 27 It has, however, been a continuing presence in the philosophical world. It intersects with and has an influence on prominent intel lectual perspectives and vital social issues of our day. It has represen tatives and spokespersons throughout institutions of higher educa tion and the church. Sociological factors can play a large part in the destiny of philosophical movements. At the same time, a spark of genius lighting up a Personalistic philosophical interpretation could do for the present philosophical situation what Kant did for the scandal of philosophy in his day. For now, however, we must not forget the achievements and contributions of personalists past. We must continue to maintain their vitality in the present and anticipate the constructive prospects of the future. Although my assignment is a retrospective look at Personalism, I am not going to attempt an account of the Personalist movement or tradition and its leading representatives?for two reasons. First, it is my guess that the audience this reaches is quite well acquainted with the story of Personalism. I do not see much point in recapitulating a history with which most of you are familiar. The second reason I choose not to recount the Personalist story is that it has been told and is easily accessible to those who are not familiar with Personalism. There is not time to repeat, let alone expand upon, what my essay on "Personalism" in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy did all too briefly. And, since Personalism so far has revolved largely around the Bowne-Brightman-Bertocci axis, I recom mend The Boston Personalist Tradition in Philosophy, Social Ethics, and Theology. In addition to Paul Deats' "Introduction to Boston Personalism" (1-13), there are illuminating essays, not only exposi tory but also evaluative, on the major figures and others as well; not to mention plentiful bibliographical references. Another resource is the long and instructive article by Andrew J. Reck on "Idealism in American Philosophy since 1900" (Howie 17-52). Reck also includes a chapter on Brightman in his Recent American Philosophy, which deals with ten important American philosophers. It is especially appropriate to mention on this occasion Warren Steinkraus' paper, presented first to the December 1979 PDG, on "A Century of Bowne's Theism." It will appear in Personalism Revisited: Its Pro</page><page sequence="8">28 John H. Lavely ponents and Critics, edited by Harold H. Oliver. As I mentioned above, this book will be a selection of papers given at PDG meetings. It is not necessary to cite other resources on Personalism. What I prefer to do is to give some attention to two recent themes (though themes may not be quite the right word) of a different sort. The first of these has to do with Martin Luther King, Jr., as a product of Personalism, though I use the term product cautiously. The second concerns Personalism's ambiguous position regarding the natural environment. Both of these reflect the impingement of Personalistic thought on crucial recent and contemporary issues. How Personalism confronts these issues will have serious impact on the direction and destiny of Personalism in the future. C. Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s Relation to Personalism In a review of The Boston Personalist Tradition, Clark M. Williamson notes that "although Martin Luther King, Jr., studied at Boston, his thought is not treated here" (296). Even though Paul Deats in Essay One, identified King as a "fourth generation" person alist "who came to Boston University Graduate School to study philosophy and theology with Edgar Brightman and L. Harold DeWolf, but who also worked with Walter Muelder and S. Paul Schilling" (4), the failure to treat King's thought should surely be rectified. In a sense this lack had already been corrected nearly ten years earlier in a brilliant article by Walter Muelder on the "Philosophical and Theological Influences in the Thought and Action of Martin Luther King, Jr."8 I must also acknowledge Warren Steinkraus' excellent article on "The Dangerous Ideas of Martin Luther King," which reinforces and supplements Muelder's position in perceptive ways. I am much indebted to both of these articles in what I have to say.9 The topic of this section deserves to be treated in a systematic and scholarly fashion, which is too ambitious a project for the present context. Fortunately, Muelder and Steinkraus have laid solid foundations for such a treatment. What I want to do is more impressionistic or episodic, though I'm not sure either is quite the right word.</page><page sequence="9">Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter 29 I had the privilege of being acquainted with Martin Luther King, Jr., not, to be sure, as long or as deeply as other Boston personalists, notably DeWolf, Muelder, and Schilling. But my association with King does, I believe, have some significance for our understanding of King's relation to Personalism. I should first correct one mis conception about my association with King. In his article, alluded to just above, Muelder refers to the seminar on Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind in which King was a student of Edgar Brightman. But, proceeds Muelder, "Brightman died in Feburary, 1953, and the course was taken over by Professor John Lavely, who like Brightman, is a personalist" ("Philosophical" 181). Muelder gives me more credit than I deserve. I did not, in fact, "take over" Brightman's seminar. Even though I did not then know King from any other student. I would have been thrilled and honored to take over Brightman's Hegel seminar. I was primed for it because of intensive work on Hegel and Kant during my graduate studies. But the academic fates decreed otherwise: I was already teaching another seminar at precisely the same time as Brightman's. I mention this only because I do not want to go down in history for doing something I did not do, even though it would have been, I think, a good thing to do. Incidentally, Peter Bertocci took over Brightman's seminar. The focus of my association with King, at least for me, occurred on Thursday afternoon, April 21, 1955, in the Faculty Lounge of Boston University School of Theology, 745 Commonwealth Avenue. The occasion was the final oral examination of Martin Luther King, Jr., for the Ph.D. in Philosophy and Systematic Theology from Boston University Graduate School. Less than two weeks ago I went to the empty Faculty Lounge and stood in the far corner of the room where that day more than thirty-three years ago now, a young black man, alert and poised, sat behind a desk facing the seven members of his examining committee. From where I stood the other day I looked out the window on the Marsh Chapel Plaza on a sculp ture composed of fifty doves shaped in the form of a dove, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial, created and given by the Brazilian sculptor, Sergei Castile.</page><page sequence="10">30 John H. Lavely One does not ordinarily think of a Ph.D. oral examination as a great historic moment. I have come, however, to see greater signi ficance in that event than I ever dreamed of at the time. Before I explain why I say this, let me fill in more of the background. I have an announcement of the oral examination listing the members of the examining committee, of which, as I have intimated, I am one. Of the seven listed, five are still alive. I have already mentioned all but one of the seven. The late Harold DeWolf was the major professor.10 The second reader was Paul Schilling. Walter Muelder and the late Jannette Newhall were there. The last two were colleagues of mine in the Department of Philosophy, namely, Peter Bertocci and Richard M. Millard, then chairperson of the Department. I might add that there is another name on the announcement, another colleague of mine in Philosophy. He happened to be a logician; he was not excited about the prospect of attending an oral in philosophy of religion. He asked me if I thought he should attend the oral. Sensing his lack of enthusiasm, I replied that I thought there were more than enough of us to take care of the formalities. In the years since, he has chided me for allowing him to miss his chance to appear on the stage of history. The unseen presence at the oral was Edgar Brightman. All of the members present at the oral had received their doctorates in philosophy under his instruction. Perhaps more important, King had himself come in 1951 to Boston University expressly to study with Brightman. Even though Brightman lived only until February 1953, King is quoted as saying that "of all his teachers it was the late Dr. Edgar S. Brightman who had contributed most to the shaping of his character" (Carlberg). King puts it more elaborately in the following words: I studied philosophy and theology at Boston University under Edgar S. Brightman and L. Harold DeWolf. Both men greatly stimu lated my thinking. It was mainly under these teachers that I studied personalistic philosophy?the theory that the clue to the meaning of ultimate reality is found in personality. This personal idealism remains today my basic philosophic position. Personalism's insis tence that only personality?finite and infinite?is ultimately real, strengthened me in two convictions: it gave me metaphisical and</page><page sequence="11">Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter 31 philosophical grounding for the idea of a personal God, and it gave me a metaphysical basis for the dignity and worth of all human personality, (Stride 100) Along with the announcement of the oral examination, I have a nine-page abstract of King's dissertation containing my pencilled notations and questions. Some of you will remember the title (at least the topic) of King's dissertation: A Comparison of the Concep tions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman. It doesn't sound like a program for social action, does it? Well, it isn't. There is no hint of applied Christianity or practical theology. The dissertation and King's defense of it were highly com petent philosophical evaluations of abstract theological concepts. He gave a cogent dialectical critique of polarities between Tillich and Wieman, opting for a metaphysical alternative to what King argued were the limitations of both Tillich and Wieman.11 To put it in King's own words at the end of his abstract, "Wieman's ultimate pluralism fails to satisfy the rational demand for unity. Tillich's ultimate monism swallows up finite individuality in the unity of being. A more adequate view is to hold a quantitative pluralism and a qualitative monism." The concluding phrase is literally one of Brightman's defining traits of pluralistic idealism or Personalism.12 In short, there was nothing at all which would have led one to anticipate the direction of King's life was shortly to take. As a matter of fact, neither did he. This is brought out in a statement of J. Pius Barbour, a close associate of King during his days at Crozer Seminary. Barbour writes in the National Baptist Voice (March 1956): The battle he is fighting now, we have fought many a Sunday after noon in my parlor. Never did he nor I ever dream that the battle would shift from my parlor to the streets of Montgomery, Ala. I considered little Mike a calm ivory tower philosopher that was as far removed from a field general as possible.13 There was every reason to suppose that King would go into academic life and make his place as a teacher and scholar. But by the time of his oral examination, "without giving up hopes of eventually return ing to academe," he had already opted for the pastoral ministry, having gone with Coretta in September 1954 to serve as pastor of</page><page sequence="12">32 John H. Lavely the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Andit was there before the year 1955 was out that King was called to take his place in the crucible of history. What then makes this oral examination significant? Simply this: it marked the completion, the culmination, of a process in which King forged the foundations of his philosophical faith. It was the end of a personal odyssey during which he painstakingly, persis tently worked out the basic principles of his life. Of course, he had self-doubts, uncertainties, questions of strategy, but when it came to the fundamental convictions on which the Tightness of his course depended, he never wavered. In other words, he did not step onto the stage of history unprepared. He did not know that he would be called to lead a moral and social revolution, but when he was called, he was ready. When on Friday morning, December 2, 1955, a fellow minister, E.D. Dixon, called him excitedly saying, "We got our case," and told him about Rosa Parks and her arrest, King did not have to hesitate. He did not have to say: I need a few months to think through my basic beliefs.14 From his college days on, King's disciplined intellectual pilgrimage had prepared him for this hour. He could say: With God's grace and the power of love, we can create the beloved community through sacrifice and struggle. As Steinkraus has pointed out, "the intellectual side of King's practical idealism . . . has not been given due attention (16). Even for philosophers, it is often a moot point whether abstract think ing has any bearing on the concrete issues of Hfe. In King's case we can answer this question positively. It was an intellectual pilgrimage that equipped him to make so magnificent a contribution to the life of our time. Seldom has a young man so intentionally set himself to explore the options that would prepare him for confronting the plight of his people. And seldom has he thought through the grounding of a practical method so powerfully in a philosophical faith. It was thus a process of theoretical reflection that charac terized his life from the time he entered More house College at the age of fifteen up to the beginning of the bus boycott. Already as a freshman at Morehouse, King had read and re-read Thoreau's Essay on Civil Disobedience. At Crozer Theological</page><page sequence="13">Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter 33 Seminary, where he enrolled in 1948, he studied the great western social thinkers. He also studied Marx and communism intensively. He rejected communist theory because of its materialistic conception of history, its ethical relativism (the end justifies the means), and its totalitarianism. He did, however, appreciate the communist critique of capitalism: the bourgeoisie "has resolved personal worth into exchange value," as The Communist Manifesto puts it. Also at Crozer, King came under the influence of the greatest prophet of the social gospel, Walter Rauschenbusch, an influence which, as Steinkraus points out "has not been studied" (21) nor adequately appreciated. Muelder writes that "Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and Social Crisis (1907) made an indelible imprint on his mind" ("Philosophical" 183). Another insufficiently recognized influence on King was the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation, already mentioned, and its adherents. AJ. Muste, then Executive Secretary of the F.O.R., touched King deeply with the pacifist message of love. But King was not persuaded of its practicality. Part of the reason for this was that King was at the time wrestling with the challenge of Nietzsche's Will to Power. About this time, King was introduced to the life and thought of Mahatma Gandhi. I hardly need to dwell on the outcome of King's study of Gandhi. King wrote, Gandhi was probably the first person in history to lift the love ethic of Jesus above mere interaction between individuals to a powerful and effective social force on a large scale. Love for Gandhi was a potent instrument for social and collective transformation. It was in this Gandhian emphasis on love and non-violence that I discovered the methods for social reform that I had been seeking for so many months. (Stride 97) And yet Gandhi did not go unopposed. During King's last year at Crozer, he encountered the work of Reinhold Niebuhr, which had a permanent influence on him. In fact, in a just-nublished book, Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-63915 Taylor Branch argues that Niebuhr is a far more important influence on King's views than Gandhi. This would seem to be an overstatement. In his judicious and objective assessment of Niebuhr's impact on</page><page sequence="14">34 John H. Lavely King, Muelder details Niebuhr's critique of pacifism and the method of non-violence and shows that "King finally differed substantially from Niebuhr" ("Philosophical" 186) on the essential issues of his critique.16 As King says: True pacifism is not unrealistic submission to evil power, as Niebuhr contends. It is rather a courageous confrontation of evil by the power of love, in the faith that it is better to be the recipient of violence than the inflicter of it, since the latter only multiplies the existence of bitterness in the universe, while the former may develop a sense of shame in the opponent, and thereby bring about a trans formation and change of heart. (Stride 98-99) Muelder also points out the ways in which King was affected by Niebuhr ("Philosophical" 186). For example, in his Letter from Birmingham Jail (April 16, 1963), King writes, "groups tend to be more immoral than individuals" (51), echoing the thesis of Niebuhr's Moral Man and Immoral Society. Still even though King's "philo sophy of non-violence reflects the views of Gandhi..." (Steinkraus 22), it is worth noting that King's devotion to Gandhi was not uncritical. Steinkraus brings out several ways in which King differed significantly from Gandhi (23). I have not so far mentioned the place of the Black Church. It is, or course, central, as Taylor Branch brings out in Parting of the Waters, in the background and career of King, especially since Black minis ters were the princes of Black society. James Cone has also main tained that the Black Experience was fundamental to King's outlook and teaching. As unavoidable as the Black church and the Black experience are, the other factors supplement and coalesce with them to create the richness and power of King's vision. This is dramatized by the situation King found when he went to Boston University in 1951 for graduate study with Brightman. "The atmosphere of concern for racial justice," reports Muelder, "was so congenial to Blacks that in the decade from 1952 to 1962 many future Black leaders did their advance study there. In that decade and beyond, half of all the doctorates in religion awarded to Blacks in the U.S.A. were earned at Boston University ("Philosophical" 183).17</page><page sequence="15">Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter 35 At Boston University, then, King found a perspective which enabled him to integrate the various factors we have briefly reviewed. In Brightman's meliorism, he found an alternative to the overly optimistic tendencies in some pacifists and to Niebuhrian pessimism. As King himself puts it: Both Dean Muelder and Dr. Chalmers had a passion for social justice that stemmed, not from superficial optimism, but from a deep faith in the possibilities of human beings when they allow themselves to become co-workers with God. It was at Boston Univer sity that I came to see that Niebuhr had overemphasized the corrup tion of human nature. His pessimism concerning human nature was not balanced by an optimism concerning divine nature. He was so involved in diagnosing man's sickness of sin that he overlooked the cure of grace. (Stride 100) In Brightman's theism, he found a way to articulate philosophi cally his deep faith in a personal God. Thus, "what sustained King in the great civil rights struggles that lay beyond Montgomery until his assassination in Memphis was a Christian faith philosophically grounded in the idea of a personal God and a metaphysical basis for the dignity and worth of all human personality (Muelder, Ethical 28). On this basis, King took his stand: "The immorality of segregation is that it treats men as means rather than ends and thereby reduces them to things rather than persons." Or, as he says in Letter from Birmingham Jail: "Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust." All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality" (52). Furthermore, King found in personalism principles that would ground the method of non-violent resistance. As King expresses it cryptically, Personalism taught him that "human personality is the ultimate reality and respect for it the only realistic basis for a positive and constructive mass movement (Boston Globe 10A). Hence, "his doctrine of non-violence grows out of his unwavering view that per sons must be respected because they are persons (Steinkraus 20). Muelder concludes: "If Personalism and Christian pacifism at Boston University School of Technology had not been so influential,</page><page sequence="16">36 John H. Lavely Dr. King's pilgrimage into non-violence might never have been so coherently united as theory and practice" ("Philosophical" 189). This assessment is corroborated by the late Harold DeWolf when he wrote, "the main original theological contribution of his tragically shortened career was his remarkably consistent translating of this [personalistic] theology into action."18 King gives impressive testi mony to the practice which confirmed for him his deepest intel lectual convictions. After his early struggles with social evil, King became convinced of the reality of a personal God, as he says, "not just as a metaphysical category which was philosophically satisfying. Now it is a living reality that has been validated in the experiences of everyday life" (Strength 172). And in Stride Toward Freedom, King speaks of his "conviction that non-violent resistance was one of the most potent weapons available to an oppressed people in their quest for social justice," tracing this conviction back to Jesus' teachings on love and Gandhi's method of non-violent resistance. He then goes on to say: "As the days unfolded, I came to see the power of non violence more and more. Living through the actual experiences of protest, non-violence became more than a method to which I gave intellectual assent: it became a commitment to a way of life" (101). I think it is fair, therefore, on the basis of the evidence to claim that Personalism had a decisive, if not definitive, place in the thought and work of Martin Luther King, Jr. This claim is in no way incompatible with the recognition of other important influences that are woven into the fabric of King's life. His is too rich and powerful a mind to be confined to any narrow doctrinal perspective. D. Conclusion I had initially planned to devote some of my remarks to several issues or topics which I classify under the heading of unfinished business for Personalism. But since I have used as much time and space as I can reasonably claim in my sections on the PDG and Martin Luther King, Jr., I will not pursue this agenda. Furthermore, since I have already addressed these questions elsewhere, though not by any means exhaustively, it would be a work of supereroga tion simply to repeat those treatments. Finally, Erazim Kohak is primed to deal with some of the emerging issues which Personalists</page><page sequence="17">Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter 37 must confront as they move into the future. I may have had intima tions of this outcome when I titled my remarks, "Personalism Then and Now and Perhaps Hereafter." You can now underline the "perhaps hereafter." Let me then simply program several issues which in my opinion need continuing work by Personalists. 1. The first is Personalism's ambiguous position regarding nature or the natural environment. According to Paul Deats, "Muelder . . . notes that personalists have tended to neglect nature ("Introduction" 7).19 Frederick Ferr? has given a penetrating and perceptive analysis of this issue in "Personalism and the Dignity of Nature" in The Personalist Forum (1-28). In the same number, I have responded to Ferr? by maintaining that "Personalism Supports the Dignity of Nature" (29-37). While acknowledging the legitimacy of much of Ferr?'s critique, I argue that Personalism, especially in Brightman's position, is prepared to give consistent and constructive meaning to the dignity of nature, even though it may thus far have failed to draw such conclusions from its metaphysical premises. I refer you to this exchange for further clarification. In the same number of The Personalist Forum, there is another exchange, this one bearing on Erazim Kohak's The Embers and the Stars. That Kohak is already dealing positively with a personalistic conception of the ecosystems is reflected in Emily Hiestand's tribute to Kohak's book as an "eloquent inquiry into the moral sense of nature" in her "Field Notes" (2442). I am sure Kohak will be pur suing this theme further in his remarks. The remaining issues concern problems I have raised essentially in the context of Brightman's Personalism in one of my essays in The Boston Personalist Tradition (Reflections 251-272). 2. One of these is the interface of religion and philosophy or faith and reason. Personalism has something distinctive to say about this, but it needs new and constructive articulation. 3. Another has to do with reason and the grounding of coherence as a principle of truth. At a time when contemporary philosophy seems to be baffled in all efforts to resolve the problem of skepticism, Personalism can make a significant contribution.</page><page sequence="18">38 John H. Lavely 4. Finally, there is the problem of the concept of the person and anthropomorphism. The concept of person is the indispensable metaphysical model for the Personalist position. The model needs, therefore, to be refined. It needs to be freed from what I call the Cartesian flaw. The resulting asymmetry between the human and the divine needs to be confronted. It is this asymmetry, incidentally, which creates the ambiguity about the Personalist view of nature. And most serious of all is the problem of what I call the opaqueness of the concept of person, that is, its very availability as a meta physical model. These problems, I have, as I said, explored briefly in The Boston Personalist Tradition. Here I merely enumerate them. Whether I will have the opportunity to grapple further with this unfinished agenda in the now or merely in the hereafter depends on circum stances over which I have only limited control. I commend them, therefore, to those of you who are seeking a promising Personalistic program. Works Cited Ansbro, John. Martin Luther King, Jr.: The Making of a Mind. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 1982.

King, Stride Toward Freedom 101: "When I went to Montgomery ..." 14When the bus boycott began, King did, however, as Steinkraus has brought out, telephone the New York office of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a prominent pacifist organization of which King was a member, and "asked for guidance.'? It is clear that what King wanted was not help with principles but with their application in specific circumstances. Rev. Glenn Smiley of the F.O.R. went to Montgomery and assisted King in working out practical strategy that would be consistent with his principles. See Steinkraus 17. 15 This book is the first of a projected two-volume history of the civil rights movement. 16 Steinkraus also concludes that "the effect of Niebuhr's criticism [of pacifism] did not prevail" (21). 17Carbert 30, lists some 33 graduates of Boston University with advanced degrees and their varied professional positions. 18DeWolf, "Martin Luther King, Jr., as a Theologian" (15), quoted in Muelder "Philosophical" 187. 191 recently came across a reference to Mary Whiton Calkins presidential address to the A.P.A. at Harvard, December 1918.
