ABSTRACT The challenge of improving the crash- worthiness of instrument panels is being addressed using a systems approach. First, the objectives for the instrument panel are developed, then applied to the subassembly of the rigid retainer. Finally, performance targets are developed for the retainer materials on the basis of the system requirements. OVERVIEW IMPROVING VEHICLE CRASHWORTH INE S S is one of the most formidable challenges facing today's automotive engineer. This challenge is being answered by numerous task forces throughout the industry. Some of the most exciting work is being accomplished by groups focusing on the instrument panel. Development programs aimed at "building in" increasing levels of occupant protection into the instrument panel fall into two categories: those targeted for the restrained occupant, and, those targeted for the unrestrained occupant. The common objective for these programs is that of reducing injury severity associated with interactions between the occupant and the components of the passenger compartment . The first step in developing a program focused on meeting this objective was to identify the sources and extent of injury resulting from impacts in modern passenger cars. Data from field accidents is then compared to data gathered from impact simulations involving instrumented dummies. Analysis of data leads to performance targets aimed at reducing the degree of injury to the passenger . During a frontal impact, an unrestrained front seat passenger relies on the instrument panel and the windshield to slow and stop him. Kinematic studies show an initial contact of the instrument panel with the knees of the passenger. The instument panel absorbs energy through deflection, energy transmission through the reinforcing brackets or through crush of the retainer. In the next event, the head comes into contact with the windshield and the chest comes into contact with the instrument panel. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE UNRESTRAINED PASSENGER Three major body areas are influenced by accelerations involved with the sudden stop and forces exerted by the instrument panel and the windshield: the head/neck region; the chest cavity; and, the legs. These areas do not react independen t ly--f or example, the acceleration of the chest area is strongly influenced by the way the femurs transfer impact loads to the instrument panel. Specific targets have been established for each body area: The HEAD IMPACT CRITERIA is a number that is mathematically obtained from the kinematic activity of the instrumented anthropomorphic dummies. It is an indication of trauma experienced by the neurologic system during the impact. The degree of WINDSHIELD PENETRATION governs the ability of the occupant to be contained within the passenger compartment throughout the impact. NECK AREA LOADING is associated with the forehead contacting the windshield and stresses associated with the rearward rotation of the head as it more fully contacts the windshield. CHEST CAVITY DECELERATION develops throughout the impact and is strongly influenced by forces developed upon contacting the instrument panel. In contacting the instrument panel, COMPRESSIVE FEMUR LOADINGS develop as energy is transmitted to the instrument panel. 2.84 0096-736X/87/9502-0084$02.50 Copyright 1987 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">860258 During this process, the legs are vulnerable to fracture and soft tissue damage. Component fracture during the impact may increase the POTENTIAL FOR LACERATION within the passenger compartment. While component fracture during impact cannot be completely avoided, attempts are being made to quantify and minimize their lacerative potential. The instrument panel plays a key role in managing energy in the passenger compartment during a frontal impact. Its desired functional goals include the following: In order to slow and stop the unrestrained occupant, the panel should be capable of MAXIMIZING ENERGY ABSORPTION. In the ideal situation, the panel should ABSORB ENERGY UNIFORMLY over the duration of the event, freeing the occupant from radical shifts in deceleration and force. In the ideal situation, the instrument panel should ABSORB ENERGY PREDICTABLY with respect to temperature and velocity of impact. The panel should offer MINIMAL LACERATIVE POTENTIAL to intruding occupants. LABORATORY-SCALE IMPACT ANALYSIS The reaction of an instrument panel to an intruding occupant depends on several factors. The geometry of the panel influences its ability to deflect and crush. The presence of metal reinforcing brackets tends to distribute impact energy over a larger area. The material in the structural insert influences the energy- absorbing characteristics of the assembly. Due to the complexity of statistically analyzing each factor, Inland has chosen to examine the response of retainer materials to impact loads. In this program, the goals established for the finished assembly were considered to be valid for the retainer material. Flat injection molded plaques were used in this study. During assembly testing, the stress states of shear, buckling, and biaxial bending and compression were evidenced. The controlling stress state was identified as biaxial bending and compression. Numerous laboratory tests employing this stress state were evaluated. These tests included driven dart tests, drop weight tests, and pendulum-mounted head impact tests. The hydraulically driven dart test was identified as the test offering the greatest flexibility in terms of test speed, sample environment control, and data collection. Throughout this program, we have made use of a Rheometrics test unit at another General Motors facility. In testing, a 1/2-inch diameter probe and a 3-inch backup ring were employed . BIAXIAL BENDING/COMPRESSION CONSTANT VELOCITY DART фЖ: A J PROBE I - - Ny SAMPLE ' _ Data is retrieved from this test in three forms: the final geometry of the tested parts; force and energy versus deflection curves; and, a series of numerical values describing key impact events. The key impact events for a material are: * The IMPACT MODULUS, which indicates the biaxial flexural modulus at impact speed. It is determined by the slope of the initial linear portion of the load versus deflection curve . * The YIELD POINT of the material indicates the initial microcrack formation in the material. It is located at the point of radical change in the increasing load versus deflection curve. * The PEAK POINT of the material indicates the peak resistance of the material to the intruding probe. It is located at the point of peak force exerted on the probe by the test sample. 2.85</page><page sequence="3">* The FAILURE POINT of the material indicates complete penetration of the sample by the test probe. It is located at the point of rćidical change in the slope of the decreasing load versus deflection curve. The yield, peak, and failure points are numerically defined by their corresponding force, deflection, and cumulative energy values. After collecting massive amounts of data, it became obvious that our ability to collect data far exceeded our ability to interpret it. In developing a way to interpret the data, it was necessary to balance two key program goals. The first addressed the maximization of the energy absorbed by the retainer from the impacting object. The second goal addressed the absorption of impact energy in a uniform manner throughout the impact event. Our direction became clear when we compared two materials requiring equal amounts of energy to fracture. These materials, however, absorbed the energy in radically different manners. The force versus deflection curve for the materials shows a sharp peak in the trace for material A and a smooth trace for material B. The smoothness of the trace for material В indicates a lack of sharp deceleration stresses on the intruding probe. In addition, material В exerts a much lower peak resistive force on the intruding probe than material A. Both of these qualities make material В more desirable than material A for a retainer application. Restating these concepts in light of the desirable performance characteristics of the retainer : * It is desired to maximize the failure energy of the material * It is desired to maximize the rectangularity of the force versus deflection curve It is possible to restate these concepts in mathematical form: * Maximization of Ee, the failure energy * Maximization of Ee/FcTe, the rectangularity of the force versus deflection curve In addition, both terms need to be maximized simultaneously. Mathematically, it is necessary to maximize the product of two terms in order to maximize the terms separately. In other words, it will be necessary to maximize the product Ee'(Ee/FcTe) in order to achieve both our objectives simultaneously. This term has been named the ENERGY MANAGEMENT NUMBER In examining the response of the materials to impact loads, it became obvious that materials exhibit various degrees of sensitivity to the test temperature and the impact speed. Several materials that performed very well at ambient conditions exhibited a vastly diminished ability to absorb energy at low temperatures or high speeds. In our experiment, impact velocities of 5, 10, and 15 miles per hour were employed, with sample temperatures ranging from -20°F to +200°F. Statistical tests were used to determine the significance of temperature and velocity in the response of materials to impact loadings. Regression techniques were then applied to model material response to impact loads as a function of both temperature and velocity. Three 2.86</page><page sequence="4">86025Ô dimensional plots are then used to graphically depict test results. In three-dimensional plots, test temperature runs along the X-axis, velocity of impact is represented along the Z-axis, and the calculated values of energy management number are represented along the Y-axis. In the below example, at 73°F and 10 mph impact velocity, the material exhibits an energy management number of approximately 25 Joules; the same material at 0°F and 10 mph impact velocity exhibits an energy management number of approximately 15 Joules. It can be noted that this material's dependence on impact velocity and temperature directly opposes program goals of independence of response. As noted before, three factors influence the impact response of the instrument panel: part geometry, response of the material in the retainer, and, the performance of reinforcing brackets. By using a retainer material that is insensitive to impact conditions, the assembly would be virtually insensitive to impact conditions. The kinematic activity of the unrestrained passenger, which depends on the ability of the instrument panel to absorb energy, could then be controlled through refinements in geometry and structural reinforcement, and would be independent of impact conditions. Generally, unfilled thermoplastics exhibit a high level of sensitivity to both impact velocity and temperature. The example above is from this category of materials. When reinforced with fiberglass, the response of the material changes dramatically. In the following graph, the response for the same thermoplastic is shown after reinforcement with 20 weight per cent fiberglass. The addition of fiberglass reinforcement does not automatically assure a planar response to temperature and impact velocity - it does, however, dramatically reduce the dependence upon these variables. An interesting phenomenon con be observed when the type of fiberglass is changed for the same thermoplastic: The significant difference between the two fiberglasses lies in the surface treatments employed during manufacture. The first system exhibits a very low degree of adhesion between resin and glass while the second system exhibits a high degree of adhesion between the resin and glass. Other factors influencing the response of a material to impact loadings include: * SAMPLE THICKNESS- the ability to manage impact energy is impaired by reducing the sample thickness. In addition, reducing thickness increases the tendency of the material to fracture into sharp fragments. * COATING MATERIALS - paints have been observed to alter the energy managing ability of a material by as much as 80%. The formation of a composite with urethane foam and PVC skin has been observed to raise the energy absorbing ability by as much as 250%. * PROXIMITY TO GATES- the condition of the fracture site of an injection molded sample after test depends on the proximi t v of the 2.87</page><page sequence="5">test site to the gate. Sharp fragments tend to form nearer to the gating. * REINFORCING AGENTS - changing reinforcing agents from fiberglass to a mineral filler, for example, will change the ability of the material to manage energy and will also dramatically change the condition of the fracture site. The coupling agents used to enhance adhesion of the polymer to the reinforcement are being closely examined: we have observed differences in impact response of 500% that can be directly attributed to coupling agents on the fiberglass reinforcements. To date, the impact response of over one hundred and fifty materials has been examined. Our studies are still primarily focused on the behavior of laboratory-scale samples. We are now attempting to correlate our results to full-scale part testing. Additional effort is being directed into the area of identifying and quantifying the factors influencing the response of materials to impact loadings. HISTORICAL NOTE Inland's program to examine the impact response of materials is part of a larger program to characterize the needs of the instrument panel retainer and the ability of materials to fil.1 these needs. Other areas being addressed in this program include the creation of a data-base of ASTM properties of over two hundred materials, the response of the materials to threaded fasteners, and the creep characteristics of retainer materials. 2.88</page></plain_text>
