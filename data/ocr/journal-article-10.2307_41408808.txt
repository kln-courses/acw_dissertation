Rosenswig Published online: 15 January 2011 © Springer Scicnce+Business Media, LLC 2011 Abstract In this paper, I ask why the insights of classical (i.e., materialist) Marxism are not more commonly used by archaeologists of recent academic generations. With evidence from the Soconusco region of Mexico, I explore the relationship between the economic base and political superstructure of the region's inhabitants as well as evidence for the transformation from a kin-ordered to a tributary mode of production. Major esthetic and political transformations occurred across the region when naturalistic standards were replaced by abstract Olmec-style representation beginning approximately 1,400 cal. B.C. In contrast, macrobotanical, ground stone, and faunal patterns from the site of Cuauhtémoc (along with patterns from across the Soconusco) indicated that a major transformation of the economy occurred during the Conchas phase (1,000-850 cal. B.C.). Along with the marked intensification of subsistence production, the Conchas phase was also when the first system of conical mounds were built at the top three tiers of political centers in the Soconusco. I argue that the use of modes of production holds unrealized potential for a materialist interpretation of the past and that the development of a tributary mode of production helps explain the changes in the Soconusco after 1,000 cal. B.C.

Far from new, the insights of classical Marxism had long been used by V. Gordon Childe and later by a small number of Anglo-American archaeologists (Gilman 1981, 1989; Kohl 1981; Patterson 2003: 91-101; Patterson and Gailey 1987; Trigger 1993: 172-173). As senior members of the profession, these Anglo-American scholars continue employing this perspective (e.g., Gilman 1995, 1998; Kohl 1998; Kohl et al. 2007; Patterson 2003, 2009; Trigger 2003a, 2006). 1 My motivation in writing this paper stems from the observation that surprisingly (to me at least) few archaeologists, especially those with dissertations dating to last decade, engage the materialist social theory of Marx and Engels. A related impression is that, when Marxist concepts (e.g., internal contradiction providing the engine for social change) are discussed, they originate from an agency/practice perspective that draws inspiration mostly from Bourdieu and Giddens and adopts an idealist ontology. What I refer to as the agency/practice perspective seems to have become the new majority position these days among those who adopt an explicitly theoretical stance (e.g., Dobres and Robb 2000; Hodder and Hutson 2003: 90-105; Pauketat 2001; Shanks and Tilley 1992: 122-134; Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory 2005 12(3) and 12(4); and see A. Smith 2001: 157-159) with little acknowledgement of the Marxist heritage of key concepts.2 My contention in this paper is that the materialist side of the ontological table in archaeology need not be occupied solely by behaviouralists, cultural ecologists, and selectionists (see Hegmon 2003; Kristiansen 2004) or by processualists (who are conspicuously quiet these days on theoretical matters). I propose that there is still much insightful juice to be squeezed from the materialist concepts outlined by Marx and Engels, and the potential for their renewal, as noted above by Trigger, remains ripe but the fruit unpicked. I begin this paper by reviewing a materialist ontology employed to understand the modern as well as prehistoric world. I outline a materialist dialectic and then review Eric Wolfs (1982) well-known concepts of kin-ordered and tributary modes of production to explore early Prehispanic Mesoamerica. Just over a millennium (1900-850 cai. B.C.) of changing artifact patterns are then presented from the Cuauhtémoc zone of the Soconusco region in Chiapas, Mexico (Fig. 1). Multiple lines of dietary evidence from the Soconusco indicate that a major transformation of the subsistence economy occurred at approximately 1000 cai. B.C., when plant and animal exploitation became markedly more intensive. In contrast, major changes in esthetic and political symbols occurred centuries earlier when local, naturalistic depictions were replaced by pan-regional abstract forms of the Olmec representa- Classical Marxism has also been advocated by some archaeologists in the Spanish-speaking world over the past few decades (e.g., Bate 1977, 1998; Rolland 2005 and see Benavidas 2001; Politis 2003). However, this work is generally only cited by like-minded Anglo-American scholars (e.g., Chapman 2003: 19-20; McGuire 1992: 67-69; McGuire et al. 2005: 360-362; Trigger 2006: 496) and has had little impact on the Anglophone mainstream. Marxist ideas also enter archaeological discourse more explicitly from idealist forms of neo-Marxism (e.g., Ensor 2000; McGuire 2008: 41^2; Saitta 2007: 8-17).

These patterns are at odds with the traditional materialist view that changes to the superstructure follow a transformation of the economic base as well as with functionalist predictions that change will occur in all facets of society together. This presentation of Soconusco data highlights the importance of using empirical patterns to evaluate the accuracy of theoretical assumptions. A Materialist Ontology Theoretical debates within archaeology are frequently framed in epistemological terms of what constitutes proof and how to go about evaluating competing interpretations (e.g., VanPool and VanPool 1999). As relevant as epistemological differences may be, a more fundamental divide exists between scholars who adopt idealist and materialist ontologies of culture (see Cunningham 2003: 23-27; 3 I use the term Olmec to refer to an art style. This style is comprised of artistic conventions and a limited set of readily identifiable motifs that form a coherent subject matter expressed at various levels of abstraction (Lesure 2004: 74-75). In this paper, I steer clear of the contentious Mother vs. Sister Culture argument and the role this art style played in the development of Mesoamerican civilization (see Blomster et al. 2005; Clark 1997; Flanncry and Marcus 2000; Flannery et al. 2005; Neff et al. 2006b). However, I do discuss this debate at length elsewhere (Rosenswig 2010, in particular see pages 297-313). &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="4">4 Roscnswig Kristiansen 2004; Renfrew 1994: 4; Trigger 1998a: 10-11, 2004). Are cultural developments ultimately explained by ideas or by material conditions? And, by extension, should the primary locus of change be sought by exploring the cultural beliefs of individuals or the ecological situation and economic organization that allowed humans to exist? Without denying the importance of including both the material and the ideational realities of human existence to fully understand society, a materialist ontology (at its most productive) posits that it is the former that ultimately accounts for the long-term patterns of changes studied by archaeologists. Proximate causes are certainly worth studying, but not at the exclusion of ultimate causality (&lt; contra Pauketat 2001: 73; and see Clark 2000: 104). My objective in this paper is not to convince anyone of this position because ontology is generally such a deeply held belief that most practicing archaeologists had likely already made up their mind before even entering graduate school. My purpose is instead to argue (following Trigger in the quote that opened this paper) that classical Marxism is a coherent body of materialist social theory that could be more fruitfully used by archaeologists. A materialist Marxist perspective is the position that, if one wants to understand a war or other political policy (particularly within societies with hierarchical social relations), then insight is achieved by exploring who benefits from it. In colloquial terms, you have to "follow the money" to understand what is really going on. This is as true for an analysis of the prehistoric world as it is for more recent times (e.g., Patterson 1999). For example, analyzing the cold war as a battle between the ideologies of communism and capitalism and the events of 1989 as a victory of the latter is a false understanding4 of events (Chomsky 1982: 1-57, 134-153; 1993). Beginning in the nineteenth century, the nascent American and Russian empires faced off before the latter was remade into the Soviet Union and instituted its state ideology. The disbandment of the Soviet Union, rather than reflecting the triumph of one philosophy over another, was the intended outcome of the Marshall Plan that used the more industrially advanced US economy to bankrupt the weaker Soviet economy through a wasteful arms race (and finally a war in Afghanistan). In the end, by the mid-1980s, the Soviets were unable to feed themselves and had become the world's largest grain importer (Standage 2009: 189-190). The ultimate goal of US foreign policy was to secure the dominance of one empire over the other (Chomsky 2004); the United States succeeded and by 1989 the USSR was bankrupt. However, it is important to emphasize that a "false understanding" is not the same as an incorrect 4 The terms "true" and "false" describe motivation or understanding in the same sense as consciousness is described as true or false in the Marxist tradition (Marx and Engels 1976 [1845-1846]; and see Trigger 1993: 164-165, 181). While the term can be off-putting to some, false consciousness need not imply a conspiratorial plot and many of those who espouse (and benefit from the acceptance of) false consciousness may themselves be ardent believers. Likewise, those that act in contrast to their class interests are not automatons or dupes (Scott 1990) - they arc simply socialized into cultures where vested interests arc able to define cultural concepts and set limits on the range of discourse (Wolf 1999: 32-33). In modem politics, this is akin to framing the debate by setting the terms through which disagreements arc argued. Hoddcr and Hutson (2003: 84) raise a valid critique that: "To take the position that Marxism offers the one true science that can identify objective reality is simply to state a belief." Contrary to the relativism of many in the academy these days, I do not find this problematic (and sec Gilman 1989: 7071; Leone 2007: 205). Neither the idealist nor the materialist "modes of explanation" is likely to convince the other of their beliefs as to how the world works (Trigger 2006: 34). To adopt the idealist position that a full understanding of society can be achieved by remaining within the minds of individual human actors is also simply a belief, and an anthropoccntric one at that! Springer</page><page sequence="5">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 5 one and that a complete analysis must model the cultural lens through which people experience the world and so the power of ideology to motivate people as well as the psychology of political leaders. In a discussion of the recent past, it is clear that contingency and ideology matter and to deny this for the distant past is naïve. A Materialist Interpretation of the Rise of Processual Archaeology To bring the discussion closer to archaeology, I offer a materialist understanding of the rise of processual archaeology in the United States. Recently, Dean Saitta (2007: 19) notes that: "The scientific and evolutionary turn in American processual archaeology, like developments in other disciplines, was propelled by fears associated with the 1957 Sputnik launch and hopes associated with the 1959 Darwin centennial." Saitta's observations are correct and it would be difficult to dispute them. These factors were part of the generally optimistic, pro-science attitude in the years after World War II across much of US society, including the practitioners of archaeology. Internal to the field, by the late 1950s, there was also a long-standing dissatisfaction with the narrow goals of archaeological inquiry during the first half of the twentieth century (Willey and Sabloff 1993: 152-172). However, understanding the emergence of processual archaeology in terms of general societal attitudes and intellectual dissatisfaction is different from accounting for why the self-identified adherents of this approach came to dominate the field of archaeology in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. The rise of processual archaeology can be understood in materialist terms as resulting from the creation of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the passing of cultural resource management (CRM) laws. First, while it is true that the NSF and other federal programs were established after WWII due to fears of the Soviet Union, the impressive level of such funding was only possible as the result of the incredible prosperity that the US experienced in the processes of rebuilding Europe. Once the NSF provided support to archaeological research, those who did "science" could tap into higher levels of funding than those that did not. The first NSF grants were given to archaeologists in 1954 but the number of senior research grants quickly increased to approximately 50 a year by the early 1960s, and by 1983 a total of 1,269 awards had been issued worth over 41 million dollars (Yellen and Greene 1985: Table 1). Many processual archaeologists were undoubtedly personally motivated by the factors that Saitta identifies. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, it was the increased funding (not processualists' programmatic papers or the charisma of its champions) that allowed certain archaeologists to undertake larger field projects, publish more articles, and attract more graduate students compared to those who did not frame their work in scientific terms (Kohl 1981: 93). Further, the prosperity of this period resulted in an expansion of higher education and the creation of an unprecedented number of jobs filled by the newly minted processual archaeologists.5 The processual archaeologists' ideas as to how excavation and analysis should be done were unlikely to have been quite so successful in the United States if there had not been the simultaneous creation of a 5 In contrast to the flood of employment when processual archaeology was ascending, by the time post- proccssual students entered the academic job market in the 1980s, the relative number of jobs was decreasing (Randal McGuire, personal communication). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">6 Rosenswig new source of funding and employment that allowed them to be carried out. Different funding and employment histories should also explain the different patterns of adoption of processual ideas in other countries (such as the United Kingdom), but that is beyond what can be addressed here. Second, the CRM field was established by the early 1970s and codified the processual approach into federally mandated standards. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, $2 to $2.5 million were being provided annually for archaeology by the NSF (Yellen and Greene 1985: Table 1) compared to $300 million expended on CRM investigations (Patterson 1999: 165). Sampling techniques and multidisciplin- ary research objectives, inspired by the processual program, became the standard for CRM (O'Brien et al. 2005: 160-176). The adoption of processual methods was partially due to the fact that many archaeologists hired to fill government jobs in the 1970s were trained in this tradition. Equally important was that the processual emphasis on explicit research designs served the needs of government bureaucracy better than earlier standards (O'Brien et al. 2005: 171). Due to the unprecedented resources and employment that the CRM industry has brought to archaeology, it is not surprising that the processual research agenda it codified became such an integral part of archaeology as practiced in the United States. This perhaps explains Margaret Conkey's (2007: 299) observation that today "Americanist archaeology remains quite firmly processual in practice" (even if this is no longer so in theoretical circles). From a British perspective, Adrian Chadwick (2003) has astutely noted that, if post- processual principles are ever going to influence the majority of archaeologists, they must be able to provide a new set of excavation and analysis methods (and see Johnson 2006: 124-125; Politis 2003: 259). It is therefore perhaps not surprising that Ian Hodder is currently attempting to define distinctive post-processual methodol- ogies (Berggrene and Hodder 2003; Hodder 1997, 1999; McAnany and Ian Hodder 2009). If we follow the money, a post-processual period will only really begin once more than a relatively small number of university-bound theoreticians making a living from "doing" post-processsual archaeology. My sketch of the rise of processual archaeology is obviously incomplete without the details of personalities, factions, and power struggles (see O'Brien et al. 2005). Material conditions may speak to ultimate causality (minimally, by setting parameters on what is possible) but cannot provide a full understanding of specific historical processes. A materialist reading of events does, however, provide insight into historical causation similar to that advocated for prehistory that, while revealing of ultimate causality, remains incomplete in its treatment of contingency, coincidence, and internal conflict. Historical Materialism and Archaeological Interpretation There are many different forms of materialism but the one laid out by Marx and Engels has been employed by archaeologist of almost all theoretical persuasions (Patterson 2003, 2009). McGuire et al. (2005: 356) observe: "...that many contemporary archaeologists, positiviste, postmodernists, and feminists alike simply do not know that many of their key concepts and perspectives derive from Marxism." Processual archaeologists adopted the evolutionary materialism of Marx from the ideas of White, Whittfogel, Service, Polanyi, etc. but often through the de-politicized writings of Springer</page><page sequence="7">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 7 Steward and Binford (McGuire 1993: 114; Trigger 2003b: 13-16). The early post- processualists, particularly Shanks and Tilley (1987, 1992; Tilley 1989 and see Spriggs 1984), adopted the idealist versions of neo-Marxism. It would seem that the basis of at least some theoretical disagreement therefore is not a matter of whether to employ Marxist insights but instead what ontological form of this body of work to employ. The dialectic nature of historical materialism6 is undermined by advocates of exaggerated forms of both materialism and idealism. On the materialist side is ecological determinism where the power of ideology is generally ignored. Such materialism limits our understanding of the past and situates people and the societies they form within a timeless, ecological vacuum that fails to account for the forces of historical contingencies, specific cultural practices, or other factors internal to society (Wolf 1999: 190-193). To the idealist side is cultural determinism where constraints imposed by biologically existing in the world are minimized and their effects on the human organism underappreciated (Gledhill 1984: 138). For all of its apparent uniqueness, human cognition is the result of natural selection that resulted in the human brain as part of the adaptation of a complex organism.7 The reductionism required by downplaying either the ideological or the economic realms inhibits a realistic understanding of the past. It is impossible to understand the political realm without recourse to ideology. However, long-term cultural viability is dependent on economic resources and the social organization required to produce these resources. In the substantive section of this paper, I explore the archaeological patterns from the Soconusco region of southern Mexico (Fig. 1) and interpret the changes that occurred during the Early and Middle Formative periods in terms of Eric Wolfs kin-ordered and tributary modes of production. Eric Wolfs Modes of Production Marx spent most of his time defining the capitalist mode of production. Earlier modes were vaguely modeled and/or inconsistently defined (Gilman 1984: 115; Roseberry 1989: 155; Wolf 1982: 75). Marx's own definitions of non-capitalist modes are thus not always directly useful for archaeologists (Rolland 2005). However, as Wolf (1982: 76) points out, the utility of defining modes of production "...does not lie in classification but in its capacity to underline the strategic relationships involved in the deployment of social labor by organized human pluralities." The mode of production is a materialist concept in which social labor is deployed for economic pursuits, usually with political motivation and consequences. It is "a specific, historically occurring set of social relations through which labor is deployed to wrest energy from nature by" (Wolf 1982: 75). Wolf (2001 [1 98 1]:342- 6 The term historical materialism more comfortably incorporâtes the contributions of Engels to the Marxist program. It also emphasizes the materialist nature of these ideas in contrast to the idealist versions of neo- Marxism {sensu Trigger 1993: 171-181). The idealist reinterpretations of Marxism by the Frankfurt School and structural Marxists are problematic as Trigger (2006: 444-449) outlines. Without a materialist grounding in economic interests, insights into the political organization and the source of social change are diminished. Trigger (1993:186) once went so far as to question whether advocates of an idealist position could justifiably even label themselves Marxists. If my position represents a "vulgar" materialism ( sensu Friedman 1974), then so be it. The untenable alternative is to pluck the human species from nature to operate in an isolated cerebral plane of existence. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="8">8 Roscnswig 352 and see 1982: 75-100, 400-404) defines a capitalist, tributary, and kin-ordered mode of production, from which the following description is taken. Wolfs elegantly simple modes have been employed by certain archaeologists (e.g., Arnold 2000; Gilman 1995; Ensor 2000; Kristiansen 1998; Saitta 2005a; and see McGuire 1992: 152-153; Muller 1997: 30-37; Patterson 2003: 18-25). However, they have been discussed infrequently enough to warrant a brief review before the Soconusco data are presented. A capitalist mode of production is defined by the existence of money and its ability to purchase the labor power of others which only happens once the tie between producers and the means of production (i.e., tools, land) is severed. Once this happens, the holders of wealth can dictate the terms under which they will allow workers to operate the means of production in exchange for a wage with which workers can then pay for what they need to sustain themselves. Workers produce more than their wage (and the operating costs of the farm or factory) to generate a surplus which is the profit for the holders of wealth. Such holders of wealth (aka capitalists) can increase profits either by lowering the wages or by increasing productivity, and the latter is usually achieved through improving the technology of production (more mechanized factories or farming practices, more efficient types of material like iron or plastic as well as more productive species of plants and animals). Ever more surplus is accumulated by capitalists who reinvest part into increasingly efficient technology which continues to increase profits. Importantly, wealth is not capital until it is reinvested into the system and so defines the engine that increases surplus production. In this way, capitalism is dynamic and does not describe a synchronic state. Importantly, the manner in which surplus is extracted is economic and not (directly at least) through political mechanisms. The tributary mode of production, in contrast, describes a form of economic organization where producers are not separated from the means of production. Neither does this mode of production set up a self-perpetuating system of technological development that increases the surplus (and thus profit) of those who control the means of production. Instead, surplus is extracted directly from producers (who continue to own the means of productions such as their tools and land) through military and political coercion. This is the basis of a feudal system where serfs work the land and owe the lord a proportion of their crops and/or a number of days' work per month. Noncompliance is generally enforced by threat of violence and, when necessary, actual violence. The organization of a tributary elite that extracted surplus depended on whether there was a strong central ruler or if local lords held more sway. Diachronically, there would be a continuous struggle between the central and local interests that make the system dynamic and fluid. Central authorities are more powerful if they command standing armies or if they can control a strategic element in the process of production (e.g., irrigation canals). Such a system of organization is what Marx called the Asiatic mode of production. Local authorities are more powerful when they control the means of coercion and/or elements of the process of production. In such cases, local elite can limit the flow of tribute that reaches the central authorities (and this is how the feudal mode of production was defined). As Wolf (2001 [1981]:347) observes, rather than different organizational logic, with the Asiatic and feudal modes of production "we are dealing, rather, with variable outcomes of the competition between classes of Ф Springer</page><page sequence="9">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 9 nonproducers for power at the top" (a distinction also made by Carrasco 1978: 72 and see Gledhill 1981: 26). Kristiansen (1998: 89) interprets European prehistory as cycling between these two ends of the tributary mode of production and Gilman (1995: 249) proposes that a Germanic mode, with even weaker central rulers, should also be considered on this continuum. Modes of production are not ideal types but instead describe the creation and distribution of surplus in a dynamic and ever- changing manner. Local and regional elites are continually vying for the upper hand and archaeologists have approached such intra-polity struggles using terms such as factional competition and heterarchy. Intra-polity dynamics must also be understood at a larger geographic level - that of the region. Each of these "tributary constellations" of local and paramount elites are interacting and competing with neighboring polities and together form what can be called civilizations (and what archaeologists have called peer polities, world economies, etc.). Importantly, the manner in which surplus is extracted in the tributary mode is political (and not economic as with the capitalist mode). The tributary mode thus encompasses what some archaeologist would call complex chiefdoms as well as archaic states (Kristiansen 1991: 17-18; and see Muller 1997: 34-35). But, rather than focus on typology, it is the relationship between the political and economic realms as well as local and regional power that gives the mode of production concept its dynamism (see Bate 1998: 83-94; Chapman 2003: 95-99; Gailey and Patterson 1988). Societies organized according to a tributary mode of production tend to generate similar justifying ideologies based on the structure of economic mobilization. Wolf (2001 [1981]: 348) proposes that: "The ideological model that parallels the tributary mode is typically a hierarchical representation of the cosmos in which the dominant supernatural order, working through the superior holders of power, encompasses and subjects humanity to itself. At the same time, the model displaces the real relation between power-wielding surplus takers and dominated producers to the ideological relations between superior deity and inferior "subject" (see Feuchtwang 1975). The problem of public power is thus transformed into a problem of private morality, and the subject is invited to win merit by maintaining order through the regulation of its own conduct." In Trigger's (2003a) monumental tome Understanding Early Civilizations , he meticulously documents that this was true among the seven early literate civilizations that he examines. His empirical verification provides cross-cultural support for the prevalence of this "...metaphorical projection of tributary relations that existed on the human plane into the cosmic realm" (Trigger 2006: 493). So, while the local structures of justifying ideologies are interesting, they are unlikely to have assumed a causative role. Tributary relations repeatedly generated locally appropriate justifying ideologies that supported the economic structure in a similar manner. The kin-ordered mode of production is defined by its use of kinship relations as the key to mobilizing resources rather than economy/technology of the capitalist mode or political/military of the tributary mode. As Wolf (2001 [1981]:349) defines it: "Kinship thus involves symbolic constructs that place actors into social Ф Springer</page><page sequence="10">1 0 Rosenswig relationships which permits them to call in shares of social labor from others so as to effect the necessary transformations of nature." This is a materialist definition of kinship as the organizational system used to produce material goods. Far from being egalitarian, unequal relations in societies organized by the kin-ordered mode of production are based on seniority within the structure of kinship, and so elders, higher-ranking lineages, and the descendants of first settlers dominate juniors, lower- ranking lines, and newcomers. Kinship ties determine who can direct the labor of others, decide marriages, have access to land, etc. As McGuire and Saitta (1996: 202) propose for the US southwest: "political hierarchy exists without the sort of wealth and power monopolies that generate class divisions. Indeed, political hierarchy in some circumstances may even be crucial in the maintenance of egalitarian collectives." Political hierarchy and economic egalitarianism are characteristics of many prehistoric societies in North America that operate according to a kin-ordered mode of production. What distinguished this mode from the other two is that "the kin- ordered mode regenerates itself and its oppositions by particularizing tensions and conflicts" (Wolf 2001 [1981]: 351). Social classes do not exist, and so conflict does not arise between classes but among individuals. However, conflicts frequently cannot be resolved in such societies and social fissioning results, which provide a mechanism for social change. What some would call tribes, big-man societies, and simple chiefdoms are organized according to this mode of production. Wolf defined these modes of production to describe modern societies interacting with each other and so not as stages of development. The distinction between kin- ordered, tributary, and capitalist modes of production do, however, resonates with traditional evolutionary theory. The tripartite division parallels, to some degree, the societies that would fall under Fried's (1967) rank, stratified, and state societies as well as those that employ primarily ideological, military, and economic sources of power as defined by Earle (1997). However, rather than typological, the important point is that modes of production describe how social labor is organized to transform nature into culturally defined resources and how this can either maintain or change the social structure. Rather than describing what a society is (in a typological sense), the mode of production explores what society does (in a dynamic sense). This perspective also emphasizes how surplus production is employed for social and political purposes. In other words, studying the mode of production provides an analytical tool with which to "follow the money" in non- monetary societies. Exploring the changing modes of production is evolutionary in the sense that change is explored and directional patterns sought. However, the mode of production framework (and historical materialism more generally) need not be doctrinaire or deterministic (Chapman 2003: 29-31; Trigger 1993: 167-169, 1998b: 89-91). There may be numerous viable forms of adaptation (or courses of political action) that can result from cultural traditions as well as to specific technological, demographic, and environmental factors. The long-term processes brought into focus by the scale of archaeological data provide a fertile ground for evaluating which factors are most important during the different historical periods. In the next section, I examine such long-term processes from just over a millennium of Soconusco prehistory, with special attention to the data that I have produced from the Cuauhtémoc site and the surrounding area (Rosenswig 2010).

The relatively small region in between has abundant fertile land and is cut by four major rivers that originate on the piedmont. A number of smaller streams originate on the coastal plain and form a series of mangrove-swamp systems parallel to the ocean where water flow is insufficient to break through the barrier beaches. These rivers create a dynamic and resource-rich set of micro-environments (Coe and Flannery 1967; Lowe et al. 1982). Discoveries in the Mazatán zone of the Soconusco over the past few decades provide one of the earliest examples of rank society in Mesoamerica amongst a network of interacting elites (Blake et al. 1995; Clark 1994; Clark and Blake 1994). Early villages were located on the coastal plain and larger sites established near swamp margins and away from major rivers. Paso de la Amada, the largest of these larger centers, contained a series of chiefly residences on low platforms and a ballcourt that define the site center as well as smaller residences without platforms (Blake 1991; Blake et al. 2006; Clark 2004; Lesure 1997a, 1999; Hill et al. 1998). However, despite residential differentiation and political competition, the distribu- tion of prestige/wealth items at Paso de la Amada suggest a lack of economic differences between those living in large and small residences (Lesure and Blake 2002). Therefore, at Paso de la Amada, the most elaborate site in the Soconusco at the time, the dominant segment of the population was not translating their political position into clear economic differentiation. During the first part of the Early Formative period, the Cuauhtémoc site was a small local center at the other end of the land between the large Soconusco swamps (see Fig. 1). The site was built on an ancient sand levee that the original villagers settled on to stay above the seasonal flood level. Cuauhtémoc covered 5 ha during the Locona phase and was over five times as large as any surrounding communities (Rosenswig 2008, 2010: 106-114). The hectares of occupation documented by systematic survey in the Cuauhtémoc survey zone reflect how both the site and surrounding area were occupied beginning in the Barra phases and abandoned after the Conchas phase - just over a millennium later (Fig. 2). Ceramic and figurine styles in the Cuauhtémoc zone (see below) were virtually identical to those of the Mazatán zone at this time, suggesting that the region between the two large swamp systems functions as a cohesive cultural area that I refer to elsewhere as an island of cultural complexity (Rosenswig 2010: 175-224, 2011a). Many aspects of life changed across the Soconusco beginning approximately 1400 cal. B.C. as interaction with the Gulf Coast Olmec began. At Paso de la Amada, platform mounds occupied by the traditional elite were abandoned at this time (Blake 1991, 2006) and new mounds were built (Lesure 1997a). A century later, after the Cherla phase, Paso de la Amada and other Mazatán polities were abandoned and, during the subsequent Cuadros and Jocotal phases, the political center of the region shifted to the shores of the Coatán River at the sites of Cantón ô Springer</page><page sequence="12">12 Roscnswig Fig. 2 Early and Middle Formative hectares of occupation in the Cuauhtemoc zone and chronology of Soconusco ceramic phases Corralito and then Ojo de Agua (Cheetham 2006; Clark and Pye 2000; Pye et al. 2011). Recent work at Cantón Corralito is providing evidence of intensive interaction with inhabitants of the Gulf Coast during the Cherla and Cuadros phases as at both sites identical ceramic vessels and figures were decorated with the Olmec style (Cheetham 2009, 2010). New ideological principles are reflected in the change from the early to the late part of the Early Formative period (Lesure 2004), and I discuss them in more detail below in relation to patterns from Cuauhtémoc. Clark and others (Clark 1990, 1997; Clark and Blake 1989; Clark and Pye 2000) have long proposed that this ideological transformation was due to local elites forging ties with the distant political center of San Lorenzo on Mexico's Gulf Coast and that these distant allies exerted direct political control over Cantón Corralito (Clark and Blake 1989; Clark and Pye 2000). After a few centuries of occupation, Cantón Corralito was then covered by over a meter of silt discharged from the overflowing Coatán River at the end of the Cuadros phase (Guitierrez 201 1) which resulted in the center shifting to the opposite bank of the river, and Ojo de Agua was established in the Jocotal phase (Pye et al. 201 1). Three 7-m-high mounds were built at Ojo de Agua and the earliest stone monuments in the Soconusco are documented at this site (Pinkowski 2006). Survey results from the Mazatán zone document that the overall area of occupation decreased during the Cherla and Cuadros phases and then increased dramatically during the Jocotal phase (Clark 1994; Pye et al. 2011). The Cuauhtémoc site was occupied throughout the Early Formative period (Fig. 2). During the second part of the Early Formative, ceramic figurine and vessel styles changed in tandem with those in the Mazatán zone. The one exception to this pattern is that, in the southeast part of the Soconusco, virtually no Cuadros-phase serving wares decorated with elaborate Olmec-style incisions and carving have been encountered (Coe and Flannery 1967; Rosenswig 2010). This intra-regional pattern documents the unique relationship that the inhabitants of the Mazatán zone had with those on the Gulf Coast circa 1300-1200 cal. B.C. (Cheetham et al. 2009). The Cuauhtémoc zone survey documents that, as in the Mazatán zone, there was a decrease in the area of occupation during the Cherla and Cuadros phases followed by Springer</page><page sequence="13">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 1 3 a significant increase in the hectares of occupation during the Jocotal phase (Fig. 2). Symbolic and demographic patterns together indicate that this region between the two Soconusco swamps continued to fonction as a cohesive cultural area throughout the length of the Early Formative period (Rosenswig 2011a). The nature of Jocotal-phase settlement differed from earlier times in more than just the increase in area occupied. In addition to the significant increase in overall hectares of occupation in the Cuauhtémoc survey zone, there was a decrease in the overall density of daub (i.e., mud used to plaster wooden structures) remains at the Cuauhtémoc site during the Jocotal phase compared to earlier (and later) times. This anomalous density of daub suggests that either less architecture was being built during the Jocotal phase or that it was less substantially built (Rosenswig 2009: 1 7-18). Combined with the fact that the daub remains were also less broken up (compared to either the preceding or following periods), this patterns indicates that there was "less labor invested in structures and/or shorter residential occupation during this period" (Rosenswig 2009: 21). The Jocotal phase was a time of significant change in settlement patterns when more sites were occupied and, at least at Cuauhtémoc, were inhabited in a less intensive, or shorter-lasting, manner. The entire Mazatán area was then abandoned at the end of the Jocotal phase (-1000 cal. B.C.) and the La Blanca polity emerged at the other end of the Soconusco during the subsequent Conchas phase. This occurred at the same time as the San Lorenzo polity dissolved on the Gulf Coast (Pool 2007; Rosenswig 2010). The La Blanca site quickly grew to cover over 200 ha (Love and Guernsey 2007, 201 1) and a 25-m-high mound was constructed at the site's center. Due to the virtual abandonment of the Mazatán zone to the northwest (Blake and Clark 1999: 64) and the area around El Mesak to the southeast of the Guamuchal/Manchón swamp (Pye and Demarest 1991; Pye 1995), the La Blanca polity appears to have attracted all of the surrounding populations (Love 1999: 90). The new La Blanca polity was more hierarchically organized than anything previously seen in the Soconusco. Forming a second tier of the local political hierarchy were the sites of La Zarca and El Infierno - each built around a ~20-m-high mound. While no excavation has occurred at either site, these are the largest mounds documented at the time after La Blanca (Love 2002). Another likely secondary center within the La Blanca polity emerged on the nearby piedmont at the site of Izapa (Love 2002). Although not enough work has been undertaken at Izapa to understand the precise nature of its Conchas-phase occupation, the interpretation of this site as another secondary center seems very probable (Lowe et al. 1982; Ekholm 1969). During the Conchas phase, Cuauhtémoc was a third-tier center in the La Blanca polity and had expanded to cover 10 ha by this time. This was when the first conical mounds were built at Cuauhtémoc, the largest of which was approximately 5-m high. As the site covered a twentieth the area of La Blanca, the construction of this mound represented a relatively significant expenditure of labor relative to the site's population (Rosenswig 2010: 120-128, 2011b). The inhabitants of Cuauhtémoc also built up the east side of the site in a 30-m-wide and 100-m-long area (see Rosenswig 2009). This represented another significant expenditure of labor and artificially created a larger occupation area above the seasonally inundated ground below. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">14 Rosenswig New forms of elite prestige/craft goods were employed in the La Blanca polity during the Conchas phase. One change was a marked increase in the use of green stone objects, including spoons and figurines, and another was the use of very finely made Ramirez ware ceramics with Olmec iconography. At Cuauhtémoc, these objects have been recovered only from elite contexts during the Conchas phase (Rosenswig 2007). In addition, at La Blanca, large painted and incised earspools comprise 4.2% of the earspool assemblage (Love 1991: 60-63) whereas not a single such decorated earspool was recovered from any of the other excavated Conchas- phase sites (though many small, plain ear spools are found at all sites). Personalized social differentiation was thus being expressed between segments of society at sites like Cuauhtémoc as well as between the inhabitants of sites at different tiers in the settlement hierarchy like La Blanca and Cuauhtémoc. The Conchas phase represents a period when the elite at La Blanca and a number of nearby centers including Cuauhtémoc created a more centralized and hierarchical society than anything the region had previously known (Love 2002; Love and Guernsey 2011; Rosenswig 2007, 2010, manuscript in preparation). The political phenomena drew in all surrounding populations to such a degree that areas to the north and south were abandoned and resulted in an even more circumscribed island of complexity than during the Early Formative period (Rosenswig 2011a). This Conchas-phase demographic movement and centralized political organization was, however, short-lived; after a century and a half, a new system, centered at Izapa (Lowe et al. 1982), replaced La Blanca as the hub of political activity in the area between the two large swamp systems that define the Soconusco. The contribution of the Cuauhtémoc data is the length of the site's occupation as a minor center through which time many larger-scale changes in the Soconusco can be traced. Cuauhtémoc was occupied for just over 1,000 years from the initial ceramic- using villages in the region beginning with the Barra phase at 1900 cal. B.C. and was then abandoned along with La Blanca by 850 cal. B.C. at the end of the Conchas phase (see Fig. 2). In the following section, I present the results of artifact and ecofact analyses from Cuauhtémoc that document a reorganization of the site's economy occurring during the early Middle Formative Conchas phase, whereas the most dramatic changes to the esthetic and political aspects of life at Cuauhtémoc occurred centuries earlier during the second half of the Early Formative period (see Table 1). Therefore, the Jocotal-to-Conchas-phase transition shows relatively more continuity in esthetic conventions at the same time when a major reorganization of the economy occurred. Cuauhtémoc Economy Increased reliance on maize is documented in the Soconusco during the Conchas phase. This was first proposed by Blake et al. (1992) based on their isotope analysis from human remains. Their data indicate a broad-based diet throughout the Early Formative period and then, during the Conchas phase, an increase in the consumption of C4 plants, primarily maize. Consistent isotope levels are documented in all of the more recent Soconusco samples tested (Chisholm and Blake 2006).

B.C. Fig. 10; Lesure 2004 Expanded during Middle Formative Fig. 12; Taube 1996, 2000 period following earlier conventions The macrobotanical remains from the Mazatán zone are consistent with isotope studies. Maize remains from Paso de la Amada document a doubling of cob size during the Early Formative period (Feddema 1993; Blake 2006), indicating that selective forces were being exerted by Early Formative cultivators that resulted in a more productive crop. Once larger cobs were bred, people in the Soconusco seem to have consumed more of them and this dietary change is reflected in human bone chemistry during the Conchas phase. Data from Cuauhtémoc are consistent with the Mazatán results and also show a marked increase in maize consumption during the Conchas phase. Recent macro- botanical analysis undertaken by Amber VanDerwalker (Rosenswig et al., manuscript in preparation) show a statistically significant increase in the density of Ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">1 6 Roscnswig maize remains in Conchas-phase deposits at Cuauhtémoc compared to Early Formative (including Jocotal phase) contexts (Rosenswig 2010: 144). Therefore, increasingly larger maize cobs were consumed at higher rates during the Conchas phase when greater densities of maize remains are documented at Cuauhtémoc. Ground stone data from Cuauhtémoc also show a dramatic change during the Conchas phase that is consistent with increased maize processing (Rosenswig 2006). First, the overall quantity of ground stone recovered from Conchas-phase contexts was notably higher than before (Fig. 3a), which is to be expected if more maize was processed than during the Early Formative period. Another significant ground stone pattern is that the proportion of manos and metates to mortars and pestles also noticeably increased during the Conchas phase (Fig. 3b). Therefore, not only was more ground stone used at Cuauhtémoc overall after 1000 cal. B.C. but there was Fig. 3 Cuauhtémoc ground stone: overall quantity (a) and proportion of manos and metates versus mortars and pestles (b) Springer</page><page sequence="17">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 1 7 also a technological change which resulted in tools with an increased grinding surface (required for processing maize) becoming more common. These two ground stone patterns are consistent with isotope and macrobotanical results and together provide other independent lines of evidence for increased maize exploitation beginning at approximately 1000 cal. B.C. Faunal remains from Cuauhtémoc also indicate that specific mammalian species began to be more intensively exploited during the Conchas phase. Overall fauna patterns indicate a mixed economy from all time periods with a wide array of fish, bird, and reptile species being consumed at Cuauhtémoc and that approximately half Fig. 4 Cuauhtemoc faunal patterns: overall proportion of faunal classes (a) and proportion of mammalian species (b) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="18">Fig. 4 (continued) of the vertebrate species consumed were mammals (Fig. 4a). However, within the samples of mammal remains, dog and deer assumed a more important role in the Conchas-phase diet and together they account for almost 80% of all mammalian remains, up from 37% during the late Early Formative epoch (Fig. 4b). These Cuauhtémoc results are consistent with fauna} analysis carried at La Blanca that indicates a specialized focus on dog, deer, and turtle (Wake and Harrington 2002). Therefore, at the same time as maize consumption increased, animal species whose exploitation could be intensified were relied upon relatively more than ever before. Each of these lines of evidence indicates that a fundamental change occurred in the diet of the Soconusco residents during the Conchas phase (Table 1). Isotope, macrobotanical, and ground stone patterns together provide a reconstruction of a diversified Early Formative diet and a significant increase in maize consumption during the Conchas phase. In addition, the range of faunal resources exploited Springer 18 Rosenswig</page><page sequence="19">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 19 during the Conchas phase narrowed and a greater reliance on dog and deer is documented at both Cuauhtémoc (Fig. 4) and La Blanca (Wake and Harrington 2002). As I argue elsewhere (Rosenswig 2006), the Conchas phase was when the earliest evidence of a fully agricultural adaptation (sensu Rindos 1984) was documented in the Soconusco. As the inhabitants of the Soconusco intensified their exploitation of select resources, the first system of monumental conical mounds was built at the top three tiers in the La Blanca polity political hierarchy. This use of labor for public work would have been possible due to the new economic system (Love 1999; Rosenswig 2006, 201 lb) and helped naturalize the increased degree of social differentiation that was evident during the Conchas phase (Rosenswig 2007). These dietary and socio- political changes also need to be understood in terms of increased population aggregation during the Conchas phase, as I discuss at length elsewhere (Rosenswig 20 1 1 a). This population aggregation accompanied by the marked intensification of production was surely the region's first "Green Revolution." That is, increased food production allowed fewer people to meet the nutritional needs of the entire society and allowed for greater population density as well as increased specialization in other facets of society. Cuauhtémoc Esthetics and Political Discourse In contrast to the reorganization of the Cuauhtémoc economy during the Conchas phase (1000-850 cal. B.C.), significant alterations in esthetic standards are documented at the site centuries earlier, beginning at approximately 1400 cal. B.C. (Table 1). These changes are evident through new conceptions of the human form as depicted in the changing styles of anthropomorphic figurines as well as associated political practices as documented in novel colors used to decorate ceramic vessels generally and large serving dishes in particular. These patterns show relative continuity between the Jocotal and Conchas phases compared to the difference between the early and later parts of the Early Formative period. Abstract iconography was also first used during the late Early Formative and then showed strong structural continuity into the Conchas phase. Anthropomorphic Figurines As with most Formative Mesoamerican figurines (e.g., Coe and Diehl 1980: 260; Cyphers Guillen 1993: 217; Lesure 1997b; Marcus 1998), those at Cuauhtémoc were recovered from domestic contexts. Due to their association with household trash, these figures can reasonably be assumed to be the remains of domestic rituals or other quotidian activities. Anthropomorphic figurines, recovered in great numbers from domestic contexts, are ideal evidence with which to document cultural conventions and human self-perception. Whereas objects used in public contexts often have political functions, those used and disposed of in domestic contexts - those associated with household and/or private behavior - are most useful in exploring cultural identity (Smith 2007). Richard Lesure (2005: 247) observes that Formative period Mesoamerican figurine "types have a coherence suggestive of rigid Ô Springer</page><page sequence="20">20 Roscnswig Fig. 6 Late Early Formative, Olmec-style figurines from Cuauhtemoc conventionality" and Rosemary Joyce (2000) argues that they provided (and created?) shared standards that the world around them could be compared with. The earliest figurines documented in the Soconusco emphasize the age and gender of the people depicted. These figurines can be divided into two types. The first type was seated elders with large stomachs and often depicted wearing fanciful masks (Fig. 5a, b). The second type was young women generally depicted standing without arms and with a lot of attention paid to forming their hips, breasts, and hair (Fig. 5c). The examples from Cuauhtémoc shown in Fig. 5 are typical of the Fig. 7 Conchas-phase figurines from Cuauhtemoc ( a-c ) Ф Springer</page><page sequence="21">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 21 Fig. 5 Early Early Formative figurines from Cuauhtemoc: masked (a) and seated (b) elders as well as a standing young female (c) figurines recovered across the Soconusco during this period and exemplify the fact that sex and age were depicted in a relatively straight-forward manner. Figurine styles changed significantly during the second part of the Early Formative period. Clark and co-workers (1994; Clark and Pye 2000) and Lesure (1997b; 1999) have described this change based on their data from the Mazatán zone and I have also documented it in the Cuauhtémoc zone (Rosenswig 2010: 186-204, Ô Springer</page><page sequence="22">22 Rosenswig Fig. 8 Overall proportion of assemblage vessel color 2011a). The Cherla-, Cuadros- and Jocotal-phase figurines were produced in the pan-Mesoamerican Olmec style with slanted eyes, fat cheeks, and open, down- turned mouths that in many cases appear to depict singing or making some other sort of noise (Fig. 6). Age and sex distinction were not clearly conveyed. Instead, these figurines seem to depict a standardized social role or character. As artistic representations of the human form are one of the clearest reflections of social norms and idealized cultural attitudes to what it is to be human, these late Early Formative period figurines demonstrate a significant break with the past. Figurines from the following Conchas phase depict humans in a similar manner as their late Early Formative predecessors. They continued the late Early Formative convention of depicting sexless and ageless individuals with fat cheeks and open mouths (Fig. 7). The one notable exception to this continuity is the addition of large pupils that engage the observer. However, Conchas-phase figurines are much more similar to those of the late Early Formative than either is to the earlier figurines (compare Figs. 5, 6, and 7). Ceramic Esthetics and Politics Changes in the dominant colors used to decorate pottery provide one avenue through which to enter the prehistoric cognitive world. The early Early Formative to late Early Formative period change from an assemblage dominated by small, red tecomates (i.e., neckless jars) to one that consisted predominantly of black and white Ô Springer</page><page sequence="23">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 23 Fig. 9 Flat-bottomed, outlean- ing serving vessels, the distinctive white-rimmed black wares employed in the Soconusco during the late Early Formative period dishes is significant. From an overall visual perspective, a ceramic assemblage dominated by red vessels is very different from one dominated by black, white, and gray vessels - the exact proportion of the former three shades being less important for my purposes than that they are visually very different than red (see also Pool and Mudd Britt 2000: 154-155). Changes in the overall color of pottery vessels used from the first part to the second part of the Early Formative period were dramatic (Fig. 8). Both the Locona and Ocós phase assemblages contain 65% red or red-rimmed ceramic vessels and fewer than 20% were black to white or unslipped. These proportions were reversed during the Cherla phase, when 20% of the ceramics were red or of red rim and 66% were black to white, white-rimmed black wares, or unslipped. These findings demonstrate a clear esthetic disjuncture at Cuauhtémoc that began at 1400 cal. B.C. By the Jocotal phase, more than 50% of the ceramics were still black to white, white-rimmed black wares, or unslipped, but red and red-rimmed vessels had increased in popularity. The temporally diagnostic, flat-bottomed, outleaning or outflaring white-rimmed black ware serving vessels constituted 21%, 14%, and 16% of the overall assemblage, respectively, during the Cherla, Cuadros, and Jocotal phases (see Fig. 9). These distinctively decorated vessels were not recovered from Cuauhtémoc during the preceding three phases or during the subsequent Conchas phase. As well as providing a straightforward style marker for the late Early Formative, these distinctively decorated serving vessels also created an esthetic statement of change - along with the contemporaneous change in figurines. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="24">24 Roscnswig Fig. 10 Chcrla and Cuadros serving vessels size and color During the Conchas phase, there was a more subtle change in the color scheme used to decorate pottery. Unslipped vessels with red rims constitute only 21% of all vessels, so more ceramic vessels than ever before were decorated. Furthermore, black to white ceramics constituted more than 50% of the entire Conchas-phase assemblage. As white-rimmed black ware vessels were no longer produced at Cuauhtémoc during the Middle Formative period, these were monochrome black, white, or gray wares. Based on the continued use of white-rimmed black wares on the Gulf Coast from the Early Formative through to the Classic period, this color combination (and the technology required to produce it) was evidently a long-standing Gulf Coast tradition (see Rosenswig 2010: 181-182). The use of this distinctive color scheme to decorate ceramic vessels thus likely began on the Gulf Coast and spread to other areas to become the distinctive pan-Mesoamerican style marker during the late Early Formative. Current temporal units are not fine-grained enough to determine if the Gulf Coast examples predate their use in the Soconusco (or elsewhere). However, the continued use of this decorative esthetic during the Middle Formative and into the Classic period suggests that it was a persistent, indigenous Gulf Coast esthetic. In contrast, after being adopted during the latter part of the Early Formative period, Ф Springer</page><page sequence="25">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 25 white-rimmed black ware vessels ceased to be used by the inhabitants of Cuauhtémoc and the rest of the Soconusco during the Conchas phase. Changes in overall color of ceramic assemblages after 1400 cal. B.C. is most telling when these data are combined with the size of serving dishes. The bar graphs in Fig. 10 depict decorated dish rim diameters during the Cherla and Cuadros phases as stacked bars to represent the number of vessels from each color class. Each graph shows three dominant color categories: (1) white-rimmed black wares, (2) black to white ceramics as well as (3) red, orange, and brown vessels. The most significant pattern documented in Fig. 10 is that the white-rimmed black ware dishes (and a few black ware dishes without white rims) constitute all of the largest dishes (i.e., those larger than 28 cm). These large, distinctively colored vessels have no precedent in the Soconusco either in terms of size or decoration. Ethnographic data show that the large serving vessels are characteristic of vessels for serving large groups at feasts and other public gatherings (e.g., Adams 2004; DeBoer 2003). If the largest dishes were used to serve food to the largest groups of people, and larger groups of people tended to be served at special events, then during the Cherla and Cuadros phases a black-and-white color scheme was associated with public events and served political functions. The change from a ceramic serving assemblage dominated by red wares to one that was predominantly black and white represents a change in esthetics that requires cultural explanation. That the new black-and-white color scheme corre- sponds to a distinctive size class of serving dishes provides a hint as to the social contexts of this esthetic change. That is, the large serving dishes that created an esthetic break from the past were used to serve food to larger groups of people than had previously been the case. Abstract Iconography Abstract iconography is another significant innovation of the second part of the Early Formative period that has no precedent in the Soconusco during earlier times. Figure 1 1 provides examples of the so-called Olmec dragon depicted by just a few lines on Cuadros- and Jocotal-phase pottery vessels from Cuauhtémoc. Figure 11 also shows the progression of Olmec dragon iconography from its most literal to its most abstract depiction (Fig. lid). Simple lines (like the three at the bottom of Fig. 1 Id) representing complex ideas is the first step on the way to writing. Abstract imagery (and the ideology it represented) may have been easier to control by the elite at Cuauhtémoc and elsewhere. No longer did literal interpretations of the world (that everyone knew) provide the basis for the symbols that surrounded people during public rituals and domestic work as was previously the case. Instead, stylized images with arbitrary relationships to more complex concepts dominated. The increased ease with which the meaning of stylized images could have their semantic content controlled may have been the key to their adoption in the Soconusco. In fact, James Scott (1998) notes that there is a tendency among complex societies towards standardization, legibility, and simplification in order to increase elite control over society. The control of Olmec symbols (of their meaning, not necessarily their use) and the supernatural forces that they explained could have made people with the knowledge to interpret them indispensable to society at large. Because political leaders attempted to increase the degree of social differentiation that was permitted Ô Springer</page><page sequence="26">26 Rosenswig Fig. 1 1 Dcpictions of the Olmec dragon from less to most abstract (a-d) within society, the control of arcane knowledge could have served as a powerful tool to differentiate them from the rest of society (see further discussion in Rosenswig 2010: Chapter 2). Abstract iconography continued to be employed during the Middle Formative period in much the same way as it had begun at the end of the Early Formative period. Complex images continued to be stylized and represented with a few simple lines. For example, the Olmec dragon continued to be depicted at Cuauhtémoc during the Conchas phase (Fig. 12). However, the overall range of iconography expanded during the Conchas phase. In particular, the double-line-break motif was ubiquitously incised around the rim of serving dishes and represents the most abstracted depiction of the cleft motif (Fig. 13). As Karl Taube (1996, 2000) has Fig. 1 2 Olmcc dragon depicted on a Conchas-phase sherd Ô Springer</page><page sequence="27">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 27 Fig. 13 Depictions of the cleft motif from less to most abstract (a-c) convincingly proposed, the most complex renderings of the cleft motif depict maize emerging from the head of rulers during the Middle Formative period (Fig. 13c). What is striking about the Soconusco patterns is that the Conchas phase was both precisely the time when maize was much more intensively exploited and that the cleft motif and the double-line-break motif were extremely commonly used. I argue that the dõuble-line-break motif was the most stylized depiction of the cleft motif and its ubiquity during the Conchas phase a symbolic manifestation of the increased importance of maize in the diet at this time. The double-line-break is, however, first documented in low frequencies during the preceding Jocotal phase. The initial use of this iconography during the Jocotal phase suggests that the symbolic expression of maize had begun prior to our ability to detect the use of maize from other lines of evidence. The cleft motif may be an expansion of the Olmec dragon image by depicting this mythical creature in frontal view (see Grove 2000). If this interpretation is correct, then the cleft imagery represents an expansion of existing traditions rather than a break from the past. I propose that the increased importance of the double-line-break motif provides evidence of a long-standing supernatural being adapted for changing economic patterns. Summary Compared to what had come before, there is little question that the esthetic and political aspects of the Soconusco society were dramatically transformed beginning at 1400 cal. B.C. This is true regardless of how one interprets the so-called Olmec Problem (see Grove 1997; Pool 2007) of pan-Mesoamerican changes during the latter part of the Early Formative period. However, superstructural changes occurred â Springer</page><page sequence="28">28 Rosens wig at this time in the Soconusco without any appreciable modification in the economic base of the region's inhabitants. As I argue in the previous section (and see Rosenswig 2006, 2010: Chapter 5), it was not until the Conchas phase that the subsistence economy was transformed (see Table 1). While never a major site in the Formative Mesoamerican world, artifacts that accumulated during Cuauhtémoc 's long occupation provides insight into a larger process at work in the region. A Tributary Mode of Production to Explain the Jocotal-Conchas Transition A new mode of production describes the La Blanca polity's political economy - one based on a qualitative change in the organization of surplus mobilization. In Wolfs (2001 [1981]) terms, a tributary mode of production emerged out of the previous kin-ordered organization.8 In the creation of a more controllable and intensifiable resource base, a greater division of labor was possible during the Conchas phase. More people could be provisioned and thus devote increasing amounts of time to non-subsistence activities such as building mounds as well as engaging in other craft, religious, and political specializations. The San Lorenzo and Mazatán polities dissolved at the end of the Early Formative era and subsequently La Blanca rose to prominence in the Soconusco. For the idealist, a loss of faith in the old ideology might explain the Mazatán collapse, whereas for the materialist unwilling to allow for the effects of ideology or historical antecedents the emergence of agriculture could be enough to account for the rise of the La Blanca polity. However, things are rarely so simple. Without a crisis of faith, perhaps the Mazatán center of Ojo de Agua would have survived longer. Without a new basis to the economy La Blanca might not have risen so meteorically or not have been forged at all. And, without intimate knowledge of the preceding forms of political and economic organization, new rulers would not have known how to transform them. When the La Blanca polity initially coalesced, pre-existing elites in the southeast end of the Soconusco, such as those at Cuauhtémoc, must have seen the opportunities provided by an alliance with their expanding neighbor as well as the potential dangers in failing to align themselves. Alternatively, the rulers of La Blanca could have employed some form of threat or supported a rival faction within smaller surrounding centers such as Cuauhtémoc. While the precise method of incorporation is unclear (and is unlikely ever to be known), the result is not. The dietary and symbolic practices of the paramount center at La Blanca were also adopted at Cuauhtémoc and a relatively large amount of labor was employed to expand the raised area of the site and to build Cuauhtémoc's central mound. While it is quite possible that dietary changes and a reorganization of the mode of production were already well underway during the preceding Jocotal phase at the site of Ojo de Agua, this site and its subsidiary centers are not yet understood. The changes discussed for the La Blanca polity may therefore trace their origin to Ojo de Agua. However, regardless of what the evidence from the Ojo de Agua polity may eventually tell us, a distinctly new form of political and economic organization began with the La Blanca polity during the Conchas phase. Ф Springer</page><page sequence="29">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 29 Jocotal-Phase Patterns Explained by the Tributary Mode of Production The emergence of a tributary mode of production would help explain at least two previously seemingly odd aspects of the Jocotal-phase patterns as well as provide insight into how changes occurred in the Soconusco after 1000 cal. B.C. (see Table 2). First, the increased number of hectares of Jocotal-phase remains documented in both the Mazatán and Cuauhtémoc survey zones may provide evidence of increased social fissioning. Rather than all sites being occupied for the entire length of the Jocotal phase, increased short-term occupation may signal a new settlement strategy that only appears to be contemporaneous due to the analytic units that we use to measure time (Bailey 2007: 209; Plog 1973: 193). The repeated fissioning of communities left the material pattern of Jocotal-phase sherds spread over a greater area of the Soconusco than ever before. This interpretation is supported by evidence that the Jocotal-phase occupation of Cuauhtémoc was less intensive compared to those before and after (Rosenswig 2009). The proposed scenario interprets the Jocotal-phase settlement patterns as a reflection of a kin- ordered mode of production reaching its political (and jural) limits for conflict resolution. John Blitz's (1999) description of Mississippian and Historical period polities in the southeast United States provides a potentially comparable example of the limits of a kin-ordered mode of production resulting in distinctive settlement patterns. His discussion is particularly useful as it highlights the regional implications when people lack the political/jural ability to resolve internal conflict and cycles of community fissioning and re-aggregation result. Over the course of centuries, peoples, historically known as okla-talwa , joined together for defense or as the result of crop failure and then separated due to internal frictions that could not be worked out through the structure of kinship. Two or more okala-talwa lineages combined to Table 2 Changes in the Soconusco during the Early to Middle Formative transition at 1000 cal.

However, exploitation by a social class was never instituted (Blitz 1999: 579). Rather than oscillating between complex and simple chiefdoms, Blitz argues that these settlement changes reflect cycles of population aggregation and disaggregation. I find this argument compelling and propose that this may be explained as a kin- ordered mode of production reaching its jural limits to maintain social cohesion. Without an alternative organizational structure, the two lineages fissioned back into two communities. The second Jocotal-phase pattern explained by the proposed scenario is that the double-line-break motif provides evidence that an ideology related to maize production and the serving of food may have been present even before the politico-economic potential of maize agriculture was fully realized. This symbolic pattern suggests that a pre-existing ideology (an ideology of production?) may have contributed to undermining the late Early Formative Mazatán system, the harnessing of which allowed for the La Blanca elite's meteoric rise to regional dominance during the Conchas phase. Wolf (2001 [1981]: 351) notes: "The kin-ordered mode can regenerate itself only in the absence of any mechanism that can aggregate or mobilize social labor apart from the particular relations set up by kinship." The creation of the La Blanca polity could have provided an alternative option that employed a very different mechanism (regionally organized expropriation of surplus) by which the new elite could cement their political power. Soconusco population literally re-aggregated in the southeastern part of the Soconusco and was put to work building the large conical mounds that defined each center in the new settlement hierarchy (Rosenswig 2007; 2011b). The mode of production concept may thus provide an explanation for why iconography with referents to maize preceded evidence of change in diet. The potential of intensified food production was present (and evidenced though iconography during the Jocotal phase) prior to the time when the La Blanca elite marshaled this intensification for political ends. Conchas-phase Patterns Explained by the Tributary Mode of Production The exact reason for the changes that occurred in the Soconusco during the Conchas phase may never be known. Likewise, the precise incentives and/or threats that the La Blanca elite employed to attract surrounding populations may always remain obscure. But, regardless of the specifics, we do know that dramatic demographic and economic changes occurred across the Soconusco at approximately 1000 cal. B.C. The establishment of a tributary mode of production helps explain three aspects of the Conchas-phase patterns (see Table 2). First, it helps account for why population nucleation occurred so suddenly in the southeast end of the land between the Soconusco large swamps and why the surrounding areas were abandoned. The La Blanca political system may have provided a level of conflict resolution beyond that of kinship and so put an end to Jocotal-phase social fissioning (documented by increased occupation area with less architectural construction) that was the result of unresolved disputes. If my interpretation of the Jocotal-phase settlement patterns is correct, then there would have been an increased desirability for proximity to the newly emerging elite. Social calm, coupled with increased food supplies and new Springer</page><page sequence="31">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 31 religious/ritual practices, could have resulted in strong incentive for nearby peoples to find a place within the new La Blanca polity. Second, the construction of monumental architecture was a form of surplus labor deployment (virtually limitless in the quantity of labor that could be absorbed) for political purposes. If these activities were directed by the elite (and it seems hard to argue otherwise), they would have united the population both within the La Blanca center as well as between different tiers in the political system through a coordinated endeavor that would have been purported to benefit everyone (see Rosenswig 2010: 285-290). The absorption of labor in craft and architectural production during the Conchas phase may have been a goal in itself. Once more and more people were concentrated in the La Blanca area, the elite required projects to direct and to keep newly arriving peoples busy. After all, power is only in evidence when it is exercised (see Rosenswig 2010: 24-27). For those talented at making Olmec-style ceramics, green stone objects or working obsidian (and a host of other crafts that leave fewer material traces), their contributions were simple. Previous practices could be intensified and output increased. But, what about those less skilled members of society? Farming was one option that virtually everyone was proficient at and another was transporting clay and earth to aid in the construction of conical mounds that defined each newly constructed political center. Those provisioning the mound builders and craft specialists were equally part of the production of these symbols of the new society. Building (and maintaining) large conical mounds as well as crafting specialized ritual and elite objects would have united people through the act of production and reinforce the controlling role of the elite (Joyce 2004). Architectural features and labor-intensive craft items would have provided a universally recognizable symbol of the authority {sensu Trigger 1990a) of those who ruled La Blanca. The third Conchas-phase pattern explained by a tributary mode of production is the timing of a greater commitment to food production and the ubiquity of the cleft and double-line-break motifs. This iconography, that I argue reflects an ideology of production, began to be used during Jocotal times but became pervasive during the Conchas phase. Increased food production was the new economic foundation on which La Blanca society was built. Successful maize crops became the basis of both political authority as well as life itself. In establishing this new polity, existing legends and myths were likely elaborated to explain the La Blanca elite's political fortune as well as the newly important role played by maize. A new aspect of the Olmec dragon was emphasized, suggesting that previous mythological concepts were reworked for new economic circumstances. By more frequently portraying this long-established mythical being from the front (rather than in profile, following Grove 2000: 290), new aspects of its powers could be depicted alongside pre- existing ones. The cleft and double-line-break motifs depicted the emergence of corn from the ground and also portrayed it as growing from the head of rulers (Taube 1996, 2000). Rulers were associated with the life-giving earth and both were essential elements of the newly established political order. As I have already observed, Trigger (2003a) has documented that tributary relations on earth are projected into the cosmic realm in each of the seven ancient societies he reviews. In the Soconusco, neither the cleft and double-line-break iconography nor maize cultivation itself was new during the Conchas phase. But, it is also clear that maize &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="32">32 Roscnswig production had not significantly transformed Soconusco society until Conchas times (see also Arnold 2009, Blake 2006; Clark et al. 2007; Rosenswig 2006). As a result, maize referents in the Jocotal-phase iconography can be seen as the kernels of economic transformation planted in the fabric of earlier society.9 Maize, the essence of life, emerged from the ruler's head and thus linked the political order to spiritual well-being. As Wolf (2001 [1981]: 348) argues, binding the economic to the political realm is an integral characteristic of the tributary mode of production. For many members of the La Blanca polity, it actually was the case that at least part of their existence depended on the elite to sustain them. People who devoted increasing amounts of time to building architecture and crafting prestige objects may no longer have been fulfilling all of their own subsistence needs. Instead, they were likely dependent on the elite to receive food from others and give it to them. The other side of this relationship would have been that the producers of maize (and other foods) would have been increasingly separated from the spiritual world that specialized individuals undertook elaborate rituals to access. Again, it was the elite who would have positioned themselves as the mediators between these two worlds either as the religious specialists themselves or in control of those that fulfilled religious functions. Conchas-phase society was more integrated than before and a limited sector of the population had inserted themselves as the fulcrum of integration. With multiple maize croppings and working longer hours, fewer people could have produced enough to feed more people. Increased efficiency would have been even more important as population nucleation in the Soconusco was greater than it had ever been before. A new ideology that increasingly employed referents to maize could thus have functioned to legitimize elite rule by providing an explanatory framework for how the non-elite majority of society articulated with the larger political landscape. The Conchas-phase transformations of Soconusco society must be understood in terms of their historical context. Increased social stratification created stresses to society and led to the adoption of new practices to maintain internal cohesion. One such practice was the elite sponsoring of feasts that I have previously argued account for: "intra-village artifact differences documented at Cuauhtémoc as the residue of patron-role and diacritical feasting events sponsored by the elite to increase community cohesion over the century or two that the Conchas phase lasted. This cohesion would have been required due to the increased social stratification and political hierarchy present in the Soconusco ... with the emergence of the La Blanca polity" (Rosenswig 2007: 22). But, the establishment of the La Blanca polity was a relatively short-lived phenomenon. The sites of La Blanca, Cuauhtémoc, and other political centers on the coastal plain as well as the surrounding area were abandoned by the end of the Conchas phase (see Fig. 2). This means that the integrative strategy of the La Blanca 9 Again, it is possible that this economic transformation, the metabolic rift in Marx's terms, was already well underway by the Jocotal phase. Evidence may document this at some point in the future. However, based on the current state of our knowledge (particularly those data from Cuauhtémoc), all lines of evidence indicate that the Jocotal-Conchas transition was the time of most dramatic change in both diet and political organization of the Soconusco's inhabitants. Springer</page><page sequence="33">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 33 elites was only successful for a few generations. During the second part of the Middle Formative period (i.e., after 850 cal. B.C.), a new polity emerged on the nearby piedmont with Izapa as its paramount center. Accounting for the rise of the Izapa polity is beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is relevant that the piedmont receives over four times as much rainfall as the coastal plain. Therefore, if Izapa was a secondary center in the La Blanca polity during the Conchas phase, its greater ability to generate maize surplus could help account for its rise to regional prominence once the economy of the region's inhabitants shifted to one increasingly based on the intensification of food production. While a preexisting agricultural ideology of production may have contributed to the Conchas-phase emergence of La Blanca, differences in productive capability between the coastal plain and piedmont environments could begin to explain this polity's eventual downfall. Discussion: Materialism and Idealism In the introduction, I noted that, while few archaeologists are explicitly engaging a classical (i.e., materialist) Marxism, a significant number of North American archaeologists have gravitated to an agency/practice perspective that employs Marxist concepts through the writings of Bourdieu and Giddens (see Chapman 2003:6 4-68; Patterson 2003: 162-163). It is my sense that Bourdieu and Giddens are often cited by North American archaeologists today much as Fried and Service were in past decades. These sets of authors are cited at the beginning of a paper as a nod to the theoretical status quo without a detailed engagement with these scholars' thinking. Especially telling are citations of Fried and Service (usually 1967 and 1971) or Bourdieu and Giddens (usually 1977 and 1984) together with no page references to specific passages (from long and dense books) or any discussion of differences between the pairs of authors. Citing either pair of authors together in this way implies a clear lack of engagement with either. Evolution is apparently passé among many archaeologists whereas agency and practice are current. The frequency with which the agency/practice perspective is cited, but not engaged in a meaningful manner, may be due to a general ambivalence among younger archaeologists in North America towards theory. Such apathy is consistent with Hegmon's (2003: 233) explanation that it is the result of decades of polemics by both processualists and post-processualits (see also Conkey 2007; Trigger 2006: 485-486; Skibo 2009: 36-41). Apathy towards Anglo-American theoretical debate may also be shared by continental European archaeologists (e.g., Coudart 1997; Veit 2004). If it is true that most North American archaeologists who are part of the so-called Generations X and Y (with post-2000 dissertations) would rather "do archaeology" than explore the theoretical basis of their interpretations, then framing their work within what they perceive to be the current theoretical norm may account for the frequency of citations to Bourdieu and Giddens. Classical Marxism may be perceived as old-fashioned by the current (i.e., my) generation of archaeologists. The perception that classical Marxism is old-fashioned is not unreasonable as it does share many fundamental concerns with processual Ô Springer</page><page sequence="34">34 Roscnswig archaeology (Gilman 1989: 67-73, 1998; Muller 1997: 27; Trigger 1993: 176-181; and see Chapman 2003: 63). Earle and Pruecel (1987: 511) even once referred to a "processual Marxism." In addition to a materialist ontology, both classical Marxism and processualism also share a concern with studying the evolution of society over long periods of time. The study of evolution was explicitly linked to processual archaeology by subsequent critics - and both rejected together (e.g., Hodder 1982: 5; Shanks and Tilley 1987: Chapter 6). It would seem that the search for evolutionary explanations have fallen so far out of fashion (except among selectionists and cultural ecologists) that Trigger (1998b) and Yoffee (2005) have emerged as unlikely defenders. Another reason that classical Marxism may appear to be old-fashioned to some younger archaeologists is that many of the evolutionary ethnographic studies that were most cited by processualists (e.g., Sahlins 1972; Service 1971) make extensive reference to materialist readings of Marx and Engels. However, the basic principles of cultural evolution as well as materialist explanations are what processualism shares with (or adopted from) classical Marxism. What processualism passed over were Marxists ideas of contingency as part of historical change as well as its dialectical approach to account for the negotiated nature of power relations between conflicting interests (Marquardt 1992: 110-111). Processual archaeologists also passed over a commitment to political action grounded in the belief that societies change and that this change can be directional and for the better (see Trigger 1998b). Whatever the reason for a lack of engagement by younger scholars, classical Marxism could provide both the social engagement with descent communities today as well as a nuanced dialectical perspective from which to explore long-term change in the past. Bourdieu/Giddens and Agency/Practice I have referred to Bourdieu and Giddens together (see also Johnson 2006: 122) not because I propose that their ideas are the same or that there is any coordinated unity of those that draw inspiration from their work. I do so because many archaeologists refer to these authors together. Similarly, agency and practice theory is not the same (Pauketat 2000: 114-117; and see Knapp and van Dommelen 2008: 22-23). However, together they seem to constitute the current incarnation of post-processual archaeology as laid out in Hodder's three editions of Reading the Past. In fact, in the latest edition, "Agency and practice" is the title of a chapter that unites both perspectives in 15 pages of text (Hodder and Hutson 2003: Chapter 5)10 An agency/ practice perspective has also become the most widespread approach among American archaeologists according to Hegmon (2003: 219-223) and others (Pauketat 2001; A. Smith 2001). This assessment of the theoretical landscape of Americanist archaeology still seems accurate to me and, if anything, the agency/ practice perspective has only increased in popularity during the past decade. Lest I be misunderstood, my position is not that the ideas of Bourdieu and Giddens are 10 One of the most significant differences between Bourdieu and Giddens is that the former embraces the Marxist tradition whereas the latter rejects it and fits more comfortably in the Wcbcrian tradition. Hodder and Hutson's (2003: Chapter 5) lumping of these authors into a single perspective (and short chapter) thus muddies the theoretical water as they go to lengths to reject Marxism, even in its structural and idealist variants (see Hodder and Hutson 2003: Chapter 4). To divorce Marx from Bourdieu misses the point. Springer</page><page sequence="35">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 35 devoid of insight or that many of the post-processual critiques from the 1980s were not productive in opening up the narrow ecological blinkers that numerous processualists had worn. My point is instead simply that this critique dates to the 1980s and so occurred a quarter of a century ago. Many agency/practice proponents, however, seem to still be reacting to an ecological and functionalist processual straw-man that few have seriously advocated for decades. In fact, archaeologists are now writing in an intellectual environment where agency, ideology, and the like have long been part of the mainstream (e.g., Brumfiel 1992; Clark and Blake 1994; Conrad and Demarest 1984; Demarest 1989; Johnson 1989; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 31, 244; Marquardt 1992; Renfrew 1982; Renfrew and Zubrow 1994; Saitta 1994). For those of us who began our undergraduate careers in the 1990s, agency and practice were theoretical starting points. Processualism was a chapter from disciplinary history, the post-processual critique had subsided, and we were looking forward. What has never been clear (to me at least) is how paying attention to either individual or collective agents entangled in a web of habitus or structuration improves upon what Marx called human history and described, in a much cited passage, that people "make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past" (Marx 1998 [1869]: 15). Trigger (1993: 171) long ago noted that classical Marxists interpret "...social change as the collective outcome of individual decision making based upon rational calculations of self- interest made in historically specific circumstances". If this is so (and Trigger has pointed it out repeatedly over the past two decades; and see Clark 2000: 98), then advocates of an agency/practice perspective are not presenting a particularly innovative approach. 1 1 Individual vs. Collective Agency There are, however, significant problems with those who cite Bourdieu and Giddens in order to access the agency of individuals in the past. For one thing, this runs the risk of promoting methodological individualism (Ortner 2001; Patterson 2005). Another problem is that the temporal units of archaeological analysis are not amenable to isolating the span of individual lifetimes in the overwhelming majority of prehistoric data (Chapman 2003: 67-68; Dornan 2002: 311). Instead, the remains of aggregated group behavior are what can generally be approximated (see McGuire 1992: 134). This does not assume uniform behavior at any given time, as Pauketat (2001: 85) worries, but simply that the remains of many individuals from multiple generations in the aggregate provide average behavior. Instead of a theoretical limitation, the temporally aggregated behavior (at whatever the resolution of the chronological units employed to measure past occurrences) is a methodological n A proposal by Joyce and Lopiparo (2005; and see Patterson 2005: 373) - to take the balance between agency and structure as a changing relationship to be empirically documented - seems to be a productive approach. This is also more in keeping with the point of both habitus and structuration , that is, the agency is not to be reified but explained within the confines of custom and tradition. But, this is simply the Marxist concept of history that neither Bourdieu nor Giddens has really improved upon (see also Arnold 2000: 17). Springer</page><page sequence="36">36 Roscnswig reality of most archaeological data (see Bailey 2007: 205-207). An individual's "agency" may be identifiable when you meet her. However, when the trash she discards behind her house, along with that of her children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents, are lumped into a single, century-long analytic phase (e.g., Rosenswig 2007: 5-6), how is an individual or her agency accessible archaeolog- ically? Even if we grant that an individual agent can be accessed for study by the archaeologist in certain instances, then the question becomes how representative of the time and place is that individual agent? My guess is that there would be a great deal of overlap within a social/class group - but I await the attempt of someone to study multiple individual agents and make meaningful comparisons between them. Or, are generic "essentialist agents" (Smith 2004: 9-12) all that is really being proposed? The temporal scale of archaeological resolution does not eliminate modeling a collective of active agents in the interpretation of the past but it does preclude casting particular prehistoric agents or the behavior of single individuals in explanatory roles. What is visible using artistic and other forms of esthetic data is something resembling Bourdieu's idea of doxa, but this is also problematic as it homogenizes the differences between individuals (see A. Smith 2001). Rather than focusing on the scale of single human lifespans, it is the patterns brought into view by centuries and millennia that are the unique strength of the archaeological record (Joyce and Lopiparo 2005: 368-370). Due to the nature of our data, archaeologist's biggest contribution to the social sciences is likely to be by explaining long-term change, a proposal often rejected in the writings of both Bourdieu and Giddens (see Patterson 2003: 162-163). Discussion: Historical Materialism and Archaeological Interpretation Base and Superstructure In the epigraph that begins this paper, Marx does not appear to attribute artistic expression as a causative role in the development of society. Rather, he seems puzzled by the lack of correspondence between such development and society's material foundations. He does, however, observe that the elaboration of artistic expression can operate independent of society's economic base during certain historical periods. While passages in Marx's writing can be marshaled to support the position that the superstructure is epiphenomenal, this ignores the nuance of his thinking. Marx viewed the human brain, and ability for abstract thought, as distinguishing humans from other organisms. As he famously stated in Capital: "A spider conducts operations which resemble those of the weaver, and a bee would put many a humble architect to shame by the construction of his honeycomb cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax. At the end of every labor process, a result emerges which had already been conceived by the worker at the beginning, hence already existed ideally" (Marx 1977 [1867]: 284). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="37">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 37 Humans are therefore different from bees and spiders due to their capacity for abstract thought and strategic planning. But, while human cognitive abilities create the possibility of purposeful innovation, they also provide the weight of previous generations that limits what is possible to think or do. Following Marx, Childe (1949: 6-8) noted that humans adapt to the world not as it is but as they perceive it to be filtered though their cultural beliefs. However, human perceptions and cultural traditions that do not largely correspond to the real world will not contribute to long- term patterns (Trigger 2003b: 9-10). As a result, economy and ideology generally intersect in a culturally specific manner grounded in local environmental and technological reality. This does not mean that people do not act against their own long-term interests (as the current financial and environmental crises make abundantly clear) but simply that, when they do, it eventually leads to their downfall (we'll have to wait and see!). Trigger laid out the interplay between historical constraints on the one hand and human creativity on the other when he observed that: "... one of Marx's greatest contributions was to rescue the concept of culture from determinism by delineating how the individuals of each generation reworked cultural material, including ideology, to accord with new opportu- nities, challenges, and necessities, in the course of which they sometimes transformed human societies and brought new social formations into existence ..." (Trigger 1991: 560). Classical Marxism provides a theoretical framework within which to explicitly decouple long-term patterns of economic changes occurring to the base from political and jural changes that transpire in the superstructure. Much botanical, faunal, and lithic data document the economy of prehistoric peoples. Artistic expressions provide us with esthetic and symbolic standards that are the window into the cognitive world of people with no written history. The archaeological record provides some of the most appropriate data with which to evaluate Marx and Engels' ideas. For example, Kristiansen (1998: 26) argues that material culture should be able to reflect different and even opposing trends, e.g., between ideology and economy. In contrast to the Formative Mesoamerican example presented here, he finds that during the European Bronze Age ideological changes occurred in a more punctuated manner while the economy was transformed gradually (see Kristiansen 1998; Fig. 9). The utility of the concepts such as base and superstructure are not that history and prehistory adhere to a predetermined set of expectations, with the former leading and the latter following in a perpetual dance through the past. To the contrary, these concepts should provide a structure of comparisons to better understand the long-term patterns of past cultural developments. Base and Superstructure in the Soconusco During the Conchas Phase As I have proposed in this paper, the Soconusco economy was transformed at the beginning of the Conchas phase. During this period, maize, dog, and deer were much more intensively exploited than before (see also Rosenswig 2006; Wake and Harrington 2002). At the same time, as this intensification of food production occurred, a more hierarchical form of political organization was also instituted Ф Springer</page><page sequence="38">38 Roscnswig (Love and Guernsey 2011; Rosenswig 2007). During the first part of the Early Formative period, a political strategy relying on local symbols of authority was employed by aggrandizers as Clark and Blake (1994) convincingly explain. During the second part of the Early Formative period, a similar strategy of prestige production emphasized ties to distant Olmec elites on Mexico's Gulf Coast (Rosenswig 2010). However, as I argue in this article, during the entire Early Formative period, elites mobilized social labor according to something resembling Wolf's kin-ordered mode of production and the fundamental transformation after 1000 cal. B.C. was that a tributary mode of production began to emerge. As I have further argued, it was during the Jocotal phase that increasing internal conflict accounts for more frequent social fissioning and an increased number of sites occupied for less time. The coalescence of the La Blanca polity at 1000 cal. B.C. appears to have provided an alternative political system in the southeast end of the Soconusco. The entire population was literally re- aggregated and put to work building the conical mound that defined three tiers of political centers in a newly constructed political hierarchy. The exact reason why the La Blanca elites were able to transform their society and the precise incentives they offered to attract surrounding populations may never be known. However, construction projects were larger than anything the region had previously seen and these were coordinated at the top three tiers in the new Conchas-phase polity (Rosenswig 2011b). The three mounds at Ojo de Agua during the preceding Jocotal phase were significantly smaller than those at La Blanca and we lack evidence of a regional hierarchy of sites with different-sized mounds. Technological developments in agricultural productivity (and the population concentration that this new form of production could provision) allowed for the base to "catch up" to the superstructure during the Conchas phase. The La Blanca elite had economic power to reinforce the elevated social statuses long-established by their Early Formative predecessors, and the history of the region was never the same. The crucial transition at 1000 cal. B.C. was not underwritten by the domestication of maize (and a few other plant species) but the social purpose to which these domesticates were put. Plant domestication occurred almost as soon as people arrived in Mesoamerica at the beginning of the Holocene (B. Smith 2001). By 8,000 years ago, maize had been domesticated from teocinte (Piperno et al. 2009) and, by 6,000 years ago, had spread throughout much of the region (Pohl et al. 2007; Rosenswig manuscript in preparation). However, neither the initial domestication nor the subsequent spread of early maize transformed the Mesoamerican society in any marked way. The Late Archaic residents of the Soconusco used a combination of estuary resources and cultivated maize more intensively, leaving evidence in the pollen record (Neff et al. 2006a). During the second millennium B.C., estuary resources along with maize (and a number of other domesticated plants) were used by politically ambitious individuals (Clark and Blake 1994; Clark and Gosser 1995). One non- dietary use of early maize may have been to make an alcoholic beverage served at public feasts (Smalley and Blake 2003). The late Early Formative peoples continued to exploit maize and, as already outlined, this resulted in cobs doubling in their size between the Locona and Cuadros phases (Blake 2006). However, none of these uses of maize (or other domesticates) remade Soconusco society in a manner comparable to Ö Springer</page><page sequence="39">Materialism, Mode of Production, and a Millennium of Change 39 the transformation that occurred after 1000 cal. B.C. I have previously described this watershed as follows: "The transformations that occurred during the Conchas phase qualitatively altered Soconusco society in a manner consistent with Rindos' (1984) definition of agriculture. While Childe (1951: 59) and other early scholars emphasized human control over food supply as a defining characteristic of the Formative/Neolithic revolution, the residents of the Soconusco appear to have lost control to their food supply during the Conchas phase - at least in the sense that they were dependant on it for reproducing the increasingly stratified social order. Ultimately, this economic revolution appears to have 'funded' the political aspirations of the newly emerging Conchas phase elite" (Rosenswig 2006: 348, emphasis in original). The essence of the tributary mode of production is not the existence of social hierarchy (though it is certainly present). Instead, the extraction of tribute from non- related individuals, particularly those living in neighboring communities, results in the ability to translate political power into economic differentiation and thus the creation of class society. The mode of production concept is not a descriptive state of economic organization but a process of dynamic integration that encompasses subsistence practices, political organization, and ideology. The transition that occurred in the Soconusco circa 1000 cal. B.C. with the establishment of the La Blanca polity is consistent with a tributary mode of production. Based on our current knowledge, the kernels of this transition were germinating during the Jocotal phase only to blossom by the subsequent Conchas phase. The Tributary Mode of Production and Directions for Future Research I submit that the distinction that Eric Wolf characterizes as between a kin-ordered and a tributary mode of production is one of the most significant transformations to have occurred in human history. However, in a number of intriguing papers, Saitta (1994, 1997, 2005a, b) champions the structural Marxist proposal (e.g., Meillassoux 1981: 49) that age and gender have always created social cleavages and exploitive class-like relations.12 Rather than necessarily adopting either position a priori , these can productively be cast as alternative hypotheses to guide future research. At their most productive, Marxists concepts, such as the tributary mode of production, provide expectations for archaeologists to compare with their data. A worthwhile direction for future investigation will be to compare cases where tributary relations were established with cases where this transition almost occurred but failed to be instituted. In addition to the Soconusco case presented in this paper, other examples of the establishment of a tributary mode of production are documented among the Iberian Argaric (Chapman 2003) and the northern European Bronze Age (Kristiansen 1998). Possible examples of unsuccessful attempts may be found at Cahokia and/or Chaco Canyon as Saitta (1994, 1997, 2005b: 388-389) has argued, but such an interpretation is contested (e.g., Pauketat 2004). As a further 12 Trigger (1990b) provides a strong counter-ease and Patterson (2003: 133-134) critiques the uniformitarian assumptions implicit in Saitta's proposal. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="40">40 Roscnswig example that I have already discussed, the jural limits of the kin-ordered mode may be responsible for the settlement patterns in the southeastern USA (as I propose following Blitz's [1999] analysis). Other examples can surely be marshaled if we approach the study of complex society in these terms. Recent interpretations of complex hunter-gatherers in North America have emphasized that agriculture may not be the key factor in creating hierarchical relations. In particular, in southern Florida and areas of California, Washington, and British Columbia, intensifiable non-domesticates allowed for reduced mobility, increased population density, and the development of hereditary inequality (e.g., Arnold 1996; Hayden 1995; Marquardt 1988; Sassaman 2004). My Soconusco case study emphasizes increased agricultural production, but there is no reason why the intensification of non-domesticates, particularly abundant and stable aquatic resources, could not "fund" political developments in similar ways. The mode of production concept focuses attention on how the economic base is integrated with the political and jural superstructure, not necessarily what foods people are eating (Arnold 1996: 78). Exploring the archaeological evidence of non- agricultural societies in terms of the transition from a kin-ordered to a tributary mode of production should provide other productive directions for comparative analysis. Conclusion Rather than advocating a novel theoretical approach in this paper, I propose that classical (i.e., materialist) Marxism still has much to contribute to archaeology. This perspective can push archaeologists to look for contradictions and correspondences between base and superstructure as well as between long-term patterns of material and the ideological change. Self-interested actors, power, and ideology are all integral parts of the classical Marxist perspective, which nonetheless remains a materialist endeavor. Exploring historical detail and proximate causes is a worthwhile undertaking and should be recognized as such. A materialist perspective that denies the importance of such avenues of research limits a full understanding of the human past. However, the long spans of time that archaeological data access provide a unique perspective among the social sciences and archaeologists do themselves a disservice to get lost in the local particularities of their data at the exclusion of larger processes. Human population levels have increased over the millennia and agricultural intensification has allowed larger groups of people to live in closer proximity to each other. Increased population density and the ability to produce surplus has allowed/required new forms of social organization to develop. Surplus production, and the occupational specialization it engenders, has also resulted in an explosion of artistic expressions that allow archaeologists greater access to the past cognitive world. These are simply empirical observations. To deny material factors from occupying some level of ultimate causality (and thus adopt a form of cultural determinism) is equally limiting as any reductive environmental determinism. Historical materialism is not the only way to tread a more realistic middle path but is a productive one with a long and rich academic history that, surprisingly, few archaeologists are explicitly taking advantage of.
