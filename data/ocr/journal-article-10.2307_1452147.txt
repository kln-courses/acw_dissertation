<plain_text><page sequence="1">REASON AND REVELATION IN SAADIA'S PHILOSOPHY* By ABRAHAM HESCHEL, Hebrew Union College SAADIA'S quest for certainty was a quest for peace, for a reconcilation between reason and revelation. He attained his goal by establishing that there are no conflicts between the doctrines imparted by revelation and the ideas acquired by our own reason. Over and above such agreement be- tween the details of their teachings, there is an intrinsic similarity in their very nature. For both reason and reve- lation are sources of knowledge. This was a solution that bred new problems. The rec- ognition of religion as a flow of knowledge opened the vista of a serious dilemma. The streams of reason and revelation either run parallel or in different directions. If they run in different directions, then only one of them leads toward the truth, while the other one leads toward error. If they run parallel, why do we need river and sea at the same time?' The impression of a clash between the teachings of Scrip- ture and the conclusions of science had made many people dubious about the validity of religious teachings and had led others to choose castles in the air of their own mind and to renounce allegiance to the traditions of Judaism.2 The awareness of the dichotomy between reason and revelation was known before the time of Saadia. But to former generations the endowment of revelation was *This paper is the conclusion of the article "The Quest for Certainty in Saadia's Philosophy," printed in JQR, NS, XXXIII, pp. 265-313.

There were extremists who took the costly risk of caution and stood warily on the walls of tradition for fear the rebel- lious power of reason might invade the holy ground of religion. Guided by observation or premonition, they were afraid that an emancipated reason might fail to adjust itself to the climate of faith. Hence they persevered in an exalted and self-sufficient life within the pale of tradition, drawing heavenly wisdom from Scriptures, of more sterling worth than the adventurous probabilities of speculation. It behooved man to yield to the authority of Scripture, to probe its teachings to the very bottom, and to fulfil its precepts scrupulously. At the same time it was considered presumptuous and abortive for the reason of man to breed its own solutions of the ultimate problems or to try to reach the hidden meanings of the Torah. Such speculation gives rise to heresy and has therefore been forbidden by the sages of the Mishna.3 3 The opposition to the study of secular sciences (nrm,n nliDn, see Steinschneider, Hebriische Uebersetzungen, p. 375, n. 55; Louis Ginzberg, Some Observations on the Attitude of the Synagogue towards the Apocalyptic Eschatological Writings, JBL, XLI (1922), pp. 115-136) was strong among the Rabbanite Jews and even stronger among the Karaites. The reading of a secular book on Sabbath was regarded as a desecration (9rm), see Poznanski, Steinschneider Fest- schrift, p. 205; A. Heschel, Maimonides, ch. IV, n. 2. Qirqisani, who wrote about 937, speaks of those who reject any kind of speculation, be it Kalam or philosophy (cf. I. Goldziher, Kitdb md'ani al-nafs, p. 28). He considers reluctance to pursue the study of philosophy as foolishness. "If the fountains of their minds were opened they would become aware that these things are but implements of the Bible, the ladders and bridges leading to the knowledge of truth," see H. Hirsch- feld, Qirgisdni Studies, pp. 14 f. - On the opposition of Saadia's contemporary, Salmon ben Yeruhim, to secular learning, see Pinsker, rlnlm p 'mp1, pp. 115 and 169. A.

The study of Greek philosophy had been disapproved by the rabbis and contemplation of the meaning of the dogmatic pre- cepts, like the red cow, had been tabooed. But in the intel- lectual turmoil of the tenth century the hostile forces of doubt and denial must have dealt sharp blows to the for- tress, if the recognized leader and defender of the orthodox persuasion not only accepted the challenge but also adopted the weapons of his contentious opponent. He opened the fortress to the invader, his rival, and tried neither to sub- jugate nor to annihilate him, but to conquer him by recon- ciliation. His courage in facing the conflict squarely, and his vision in showing a way of co6peration between the power of reason and the realm of revelation, were to deter- study of science and philosophy existed in the orthodox circles of Eastern Islam.

There is only one truth, but two ways lead to it. Reason, properly used, can never contradict the teachings of revelation, for both spring from the same fountain.7 The agreement between them is a necessary implication of the idea of monotheism. What is contained in a divine message can neither misrepresent reality nor contradict any truth taught by science, for it originated in the wisdom of the God who created all reality and knows all truth.8 Disagreement of revelation with the verities of reason would presuppose the existence of a real- ity and truth beyond the power and knowledge of God, a presupposition implying a plurality of deities, each having limited knowledge and power.9 Saadia undertakes to perform his reconciliation by prov- 4 See Jacob Guttmann, Die Beziehungen der Religionsphilosophie des Maimonides zu den Lehren seiner Jiidischen Vorignger, Moses ben Maimon, II, pp. 201-216; Malter, Saadia, pp. 272 ff. s Cf.

Pursuant to this view, he has the task of justifying the need for revelation in spite of its compatibility with the conceptions of reason. In addi- tion, the introduction of reason as a judge in matters of faith brings up a question as to the trustworthiness of revelation as a source of truth. The rationality of the particular teachings and command- ments of religion,"' and their incapability of being refuted or disproved by reason," are principles taught by revela- tion. Assured by Divine authority of the rationality of Scripture, Saadia is also confident of the ability of man to understand the significance of the Biblical teachings. His book is an attempt to unfold and to prove this rationality. Yet he is compelled to admit that although some of the precepts of religion are intelligible, others cannot be ex- plained by the concepts provided by reason. Thus they must be divided into a class of rational and a class of traditional precepts.'2 Ritual impurity, for instance, is an irrational concept, derived neither from reason nor from sense- perception but taught by the Torah.'3 However, consistent in his principle of the rationality of the contents of revela- tion, Saadia asserts that precepts whose meaning is not IO P. 11: ItWRm -1y7 '33m C1nf n-i I1n -nMY' i pn y "-Y3 -ivt: 'z 13y-lrNl 1,',m ',' ip lp,'ln.

If we examine them, we discover in them some rational elements.I5 The difference between the class of rational and the class of traditional precepts consists in the point, that the meaning and rationality of the first class is obvious, while the meaning and rationality of the second class is hidden. Consequently the precepts of the first class are completely understandable, while the precepts of the second class are only partially understandable. Saadia does not surrender completely to rationalism. He knows that Divine wisdom is beyond the bounds of human reason,'6 that the human mind is limited in its reach,17 and that our ability to express our thoughts is hampered by the limitations of language.'8 Though he attempts to deduce God from logical premises, his concept of God is neither empty nor overt. While eliminating all anthropomorphic features from his concept of God, his mind eventually overflows in a song of praise,'9 an outlet for his affection for God, that was welling up in his heart.20 He knows, too, I4 P. 61: Irnm n1,ywon n1mon ,L3D H.

There are dogmas and ideas which the reason is compelled to assume without being able to realize or to understand them,22 as, for example, the belief in the resurrection of the dead,23 and the even less fathomable24 idea of creatio ex nihilo.25 The unverifiable part of the religious doctrine offers an explanation for "the necessity for divine messengers and prophets. For I have heard that there are people who say that men do not need prophets, that their intelligence is sufficient for them to distinguish the good from the evil. I considered this argument and saw that if the matter were as they assert, the Creator would have known that even better and would not have sent messengers, as he does nothing without reason. Then I studied it closely and found that man urgently needs prophets."26 For though the truth of revelation is assimilable, it is not attainable by natural reason. Revelation is therefore indispensable27 as a source not only for the traditional precepts whose meaning is not apparent, but also for the rational precepts. For reason may grasp principles, but not the particulars of their observance.28 It may comprehend, for example, man's debt of gratitude toward God, but it does not specify the 21 P. 41: ,prn b ptm ,pily ~ pyinyl ,p- 0o pI -nr ni-mn' tnln i9Z Irnp by nlDy n3 p rP v iy nl n ;1z7 man ,Q6Y3 i3 6y3Y1. 22 P. 37: ;-i",,3 . il nniN nn' nw ,':' l:, : n,y ',pw3 ~:. 23 P. 114: cnmninmi onmnis, nmrtnn own x-'. nr p n-in o-rna nn,n 1'ml. 24 p. 107: nm-r ninDn mnip -nin 5p nnr, aoUn lp'yn S D'rnonD n"nnl -I'-TV b . 25 P. 37: ln S IDn31 .':'1D sI '- K ~:' - DK'I1 lt n, wi,n vii, K:1=31 1ait - l.innty Doabn 43"n Ki 1;t n' Ut ny 1l1Y0 DW'Y'D O'K ll^i 1 'llo'V1 13 y O'V3 J1'- D Kl1 n 'l'K,u nKT! lnlm nl1 13'1-Yl' 'D1 ...

For this we are dependent on the prophets who teach us the specific time, text and circumstances of prayer. For the same reason we are dependent on the instruction of the prophets about the particulars of all laws and institutions. If we were left without guidance about them, there would be perpetual strife and dispute.29 To abandon revelation and to rely on reason alone, would be sinful.30 Scripture is a safer guide to truth than specula- tion. A person who relies on what he may achieve by his reason may find the truth or may miss it. In any case he will be without religion until he finds the truth. And if he does find the truth by reason, he is never sure that he may not later be assailed by doubts which will lead him to forsake his adopted belief.3' On the other hand, truth which is accepted on the authority of revelation is sure; it can resist doubt and argument. It is important to note that Saadia quotes the argument about the superfluousness of revelation in the name of "people" and not as his own problem, and that in his refu- tation of this argument, revelation is said to be indispen- sable because of its content. Apart from this problem Saadia brings up another ques- tion, the nature of which has often been misinterpreted.32 The question is:--If the content of religious doctrines can be proved by reason, why did God offer it to us in the way of prophecy, and demonstrate its truth by miracles 29 Pp. 60-61. 30 P. 11: -inN bSt i n y l rDDOWD Mr^ 'v'zI '-ID m?ltx W2 lY3 ?

It is not a question of revela- tion, but of miracles. Why did he appeal to the senses and not directly to reason? This issue is brought up imme- diately after Saadia's discussion of miracles as evidence for the trustworthiness of revelation.33 It is the result of Saadia's view that we can and should reach a reasonable understanding of revelation, and it amounts to asking: why did the Lord cause us to go the roundabout way in- stead of offering us reasonable proofs in revelation itself? In his answer to this question he reminds us that the studies necessary to enable man to understand rational proofs require time. If we were to acquire the Divine truths in the language of speculation, we should be left for some time without the Torah. Furthermore, there might be people who would never finish that course of study because of inability, dislike or doubt. Therefore the Creator spared us all this difficulty, sent us prophets, and showed us perceivable and undeniable miracles. Moreover, miracles in contradiction to speculative proofs are a mode of con- vincing more suitable to the ignorant multitude than rational ideas.34 It is almost generally asserted that, according to Saadia, revelation was given out of consideration for the ignorant multitude. This is incorrect. The fact is that Saadia deemed revelation, as such, to be indispensable. Considera- tion for the multitude consisted exclusively in proving revelation by miracles instead of by rational ideas. Saadia's recourse to revelation, taken with thoughtful deliberation, is not a desertion of the intellect or a complete submission to faith. It attests the superiority of revelation 33 P. 12 (Ar. p. 24): ilrn'W -imKnl i ','-ix mur n, Irn ,~Y ny D' a4I ?D ,1M'n,9 1 iran -I?vt -rnl 1 1'yI n'1 pn. mp ni"p1n "-1nn '-mn-D 34 nPlpN. nnl - 'ni . n;1 lby ;l -Anlmln 1n-n onlN Iyl77w noninn 34 Pp. 12-13. 399</page><page sequence="10">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW rather than the inferiority of reason. The demarcation is clear. Judaism, as a supernatural religion, is able to give a decree of certitude that goes beyond the power of natural reason. The scope of man's thinking is limited.35 His acquisition of knowledge is a slow process that requires a certain amount of time. He is subject to defects and liable to error, because of his nature as an imperfect, created being.36 On the other hand, what is communicated by revelation emanates from the Divine, the perfect knowl- edge. The glory of revelation thus eclipses the light of reason, which constitutes the essence of man. This thought is apparently expressed in the evaluation of Scripture as the greatest gift to man, except that of life itself.37 Thus Saa- dia's proud statement that revelation has the merits of speculation and can appeal to the reason, is not controvert- ible. Reason lacks the qualities of the supernatural source. Saadia emphasized the necessity of reason against those extremists who rejected the right and need of speculation. The use of the faculty which constitutes the essence of man cannot be prohibited. In fact, we are not only permitted but even obliged to employ our reason in the interpretation of revelation and to integrate its content into the system of our reasonable thinking.38 To the question: why should we look for affirmation of our beliefs, Saadia would reply: if the content of revelation is rational why not find support for our belief in it, in its agreement with knowledge derived from other sources, or find evidence in its own meaning instead of relying on authority. Moreover, those who are shaken by skepticism, whose naive faith has collapsed, can 35 Cf. p. 37: mnr:r x 9 K,l mn t,mn 1,Y lion 6y) nrWv nn. 36 P. 4: l:'nii pDDin 1i ",,n ixy Kl o'm n : 11 mnn. 37 P. 58: n D'l'yov rInD omn 1o inKm n ann m 1 m, '5m Inn, rn nnmnl 1DD D'tnrm rmn1 n- KNm ... .nm,n nwuim nmDmn nnxnn mK. 38 P. 11: nannn Dy 1 -1 m 13 I: '1 13Du u'i m D'y , prDn1', 'n t&lt;ni ply-n 'I ntonmn; p. 13: 1'yn nt rr l:v 'Ny 11non3 ]-y nriw 131=; p. 10: sonm pl O'K:33n 'IDD Dl1n nXI1 nmaK] rrnn '3nya 0n. 400</page><page sequence="11">SAADIA S PHILOSOPHY-HESCHEL find religion again only in the domain of proof and reason. Mere repetition of traditional ideas, or naive faith based on the testimony of tradition, does not suffice to resist the pressure of opposing arguments.39 Only the faith that is supported by reason can stand the onslaught of criticism. For the certainty of that which rests on both the basis of reason and the evidence of miracles is superior to the evi- dence of any rational argument that may be brought to refute it.40 Hence Saadia's aim in writing his book was to transform belief into a conviction, founded on speculation. He wanted to achieve two things:41 a) to explain in ra- tional terms what is taught by revelation and to prove by means of reason what has been accepted on the authority of miracles,42 thus establishing a form of belief as specified in its definition;43 b) "to answer arguments of the oppo- nents against any of our teachings."44 Reason aids revelation not only in the understanding and defense of its content but also in the elucidation of 39 P. 3: m'mnno D'nD nDvin 'i-n O'-m: m3' oniryl nDt i n^ annonl nDoi 'i3M by Q'ND1nDni -D9T1. 40 P. 16: 'l'':3 nimmi l'jp pilnv ', y nmnlr n 1' V'ln ,nprn mnl , lnn' lrn,n;; cf. the contrast between D'm':3 and a',iDoi', on p. 12. 41 P. 11: nnanr on: bnu;l ozy 3V3 Inrmn )3y3 QsIyil o:pin MlMN '3 y-DI,3 ,n I 3r ='vD l'3yT' nro yp lihxm; the contrast between lysa and yn': (Ar. p. 22: itaJ\ -J t: ) points to the difference between the supposed or reported and the actual in the sense of proved, cf. p. 12: l',n i3ynr' n'r 5ysn ,'XK pnl Jipn:l 1"Y3 m i n l~mn' nrv 'lnr n yl ,ra:.

There is only one truth, valid equally in secular and religious spheres.45 The rule that whatever contradicts what has been established by reason or sense-perception is not true,46 applies to Scriptures, too. Thus whatever is found in Scripture that seems to contradict speculation,47 or experience, or to disagree with another biblical passage or an oral tradition,48 should not be taken literally but be explained metaphorically as, according to Saadia, was the practice of the ancient trans- lators of the Bible.49 This principle is by no means an epistemological decision that reason is superior to Scripture, but rather a herme- neutical rule.50 Its intention is not to dismiss the authority of Scriptures, but to discard one of two possible interpreta- tions of a Scriptural text. This rule is based upon two assumptions. First, that some Scriptural texts ought to be interpreted metaphorically and not literally, for certain words were meant to be understood figuratively. For example, the expression "God's hand" denotes power, not the extremity of the arm.5s Second, that biblical teachings are in accordance with human reason.

Since the rationality of Biblical teachings is affirmed by the Bible,52 a contradiction to reason could be regarded as a contradiction to another biblical passage. Saadia strongly rejects the complete rationalization of the Bible which turns the non-rational precepts, the an- cient narratives and miracles into an allegory. Such alle- gorization would, for example, interpret the command- ment not to eat leaven on Pessah as meaning not to be unchaste, for leaven is sometimes used figuratively for lasciviousness. In effect, this method would deny creation and miracles, would abrogate the law and nullify Judaism.53 However, Saadia does not clearly determine when the method of metaphorical interpretation must be applied and when it must be dispensed with. Saadia frequently states that faith is precedent to reason with regard to the content of revelation. We accept first and investigate later. This does not mean that faith is blind; quite the contrary. Revelation must be verified by adequate evidence in order to be accepted. But this evidence bears only upon the act of revelation, not upon the particular teachings promulgated by it. These partic- ular teachings should be accepted on the authority of revelation before we attempt to explain or justify them by our reason. 52 See n. 256 and p. 68. 53 P. 112; "Some of them [the Karaites] contend with us in a spec- ulative way, presenting various views. The first thing to do now is to refute speculation in matters of traditional laws." mtapy l]yn ln DomD y'i,NPt '3 DJK'pQ R K9tK NIQK ROpK09 n nNci '9 IrinKI D'pIK p'l. 6 ry'YDDi, JQR (1910) XVIII, p. 607. 403</page><page sequence="14">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW We may distinguish three stages in man's attitude toward revelation. a) The verification of an act of revelation by miracles, b) the acceptance of the contents of this re- velation on the ground of its supernatural authority, c) the justification of the contents of revelation by means of our logical reason. Accordingly, Saadia's procedure is to record a doctrine as taught by Scripture and then to prove it rationally. A CRITICAL POSTSCRIPT What justifies our confidence in the things in which we believe? What test do we apply, when our confidence is challenged? At first Saadia regarded the miracles per- formed by Moses as the sole ground for the trustworthiness of revelation. However, confronted with a suggestion to accept teachings promulgated by anyone who would sup- port his claim to prophecy by the performance of miracles, he admits that the evidence of miracles alone is insufficient and that the grounds on which we believe in Moses is the rationality of his utterances.54 Saadia thus combines the problem of the trustworthiness of revelation with that of the rationality of its contents. They are no longer separate problems. The authority of revelation has its foundation in the rationality of its content as well as in miracles. Yet this daring view provokes the question: On what grounds did the Jews accept the recommendation of the non-rational precepts, if miracles do not furnish sufficient grounds for acceptance of a revelation? In fact, this view cannot be integrated into Saadia's system of thought. For, though the trustworthiness of the prophetic messenger has been validated by miracles, and part of its content justi- s5 p. 68: naD 73N n:7 ' pnswlDl nilnl n nnn m nwr 1,z'nw nDWi InlN UKb131 1-imn O YDW itvm 1 IIWB nU it n -nn l13tp' K':] 4,= 13 in ZDK V1y wnviDn 13DD vpz3 -iOvW. 404</page><page sequence="15">SAADIA S PHILOSOPHY-HESCHEL fled by reason, its unverifiable, inscrutable propositions were not accepted through understanding of their intrinsic meaning but on the authority of the prophet. An equalization of revelation and reason involves the mind in many difficulties. It would refute the assumption, shared by Saadia, that to believe is a Divine command- ment.55 For, if we understand, no commandment is neces- sary. If we do not understand, no commandment will make us believe. Saadia's concept of belief makes it difficult to under- stand why faith is regarded as a cardinal religious virtue, as Saadia must have thought, in common with the teachers of the Talmud.56 If the complete content of revelation was accepted from the beginning on account of reason, or was capable of being justified by reason later on, there was no room left for faith. If, on the other hand, revelation was accepted without understanding of its content, such an attitude, if measured by reason only is nothing but lack of knowledge and poorly founded belief and should not be regarded as a virtue but as a defect. Speculation or nazar (=lpr) is a term that occurs in Saadia's book more often than any other term. It signifies the method by which he tried to test and to confirm the teachings of religion. He insists on nothing so strongly as on the application of this method, which is a process of arranging and comparing the reasons for and against a 55 P. 11: Oln'lm onn o''mp l'Dtw 131i, see n. 212.

Saadia's task was to prove that the teach- ings of Judaism are consistent with the laws of nature and even postulated by philosophy. However, the views of science and philosophy are subject to change in the develop- ment of thought, and speculation is not always free from hidden bias, predilection and logical habits. We can well understand why there was oppostion to the recognition of speculation as the supreme judge over matters of faith. The attempt to prove everything by reason may some- times amount to an attempt to do without it. It is possible to cut the ground from under faith by trying to support it. Beliefs that give way when they collide with reason stand on an oblique plane from which even the slightest shock may cause them to slide into disbelief. The human mind is one-sided. It can never grasp all of reality at once. When we look at things we see either the features that are common to all of them or the features that distinguish each of them. There are periods in the history of thought in which a sense for the common and universal is best developed, and there are periods in which a sense for the distinct and individual is particularly keen. Philo's mind, for example, moved on a path which passed by the specific and the different - in the realms of Juda- ism and Hellenism. To him, both offered the same message; the ecstasy that he knew from Hellenistic cults he assumed to be identical with the experience of prophetic revelation.58 Saadia, too, was mainly interested in pointing to the com- mon elements in reason and revelation and desired to equalize what was different in them. Not that he wished 57 See Goldziher, ZDMG, XXXV (1881), pp. 773-783, and T. de Boer, EI, III; pp. 880-890. s8 See A.

His was a mode of thinking which saw in reality harmony and unity, rather than discord and divergence, a vision that is not shared by all thinkers. Faith and reason, we are inclined to suppose, should not be compared with each other. They are incongruous, in some aspects even incommensurable. It is impossible to render the essentials of faith in abstract notions, nor can its truth be proved by logical arguments. Its demon- stration would mean its frustration. Its certainty is intu- itive, not speculative. Many of its elements can neither be tested nor verified. A comparison of faith with reason does not enhance either of the two but reduces one of them. There are many phenomena that cannot be measured with abstract knowledge, as, for example, man's relation to art or beauty. Even less can faith be evaluated in terms of reason. Faith is usually regarded as inferior to knowledge. What we gain from a rational justification of faith is the idea that the existence of God is as probable as ether in physics or phlogiston in chemistry, a hypothesis that can easily be refuted or rendered superfluous by a change of premises. Such a supposition is an impotent expression for the most powerful idea of the human soul. It tries to fill out the universe with a tiny abstract figure of speech. It explains the mystery of God as badly as a bottle of milk exemplifies the Milky Way. Faith is not a theoretical act based on a logical conclusion. It does not originate in the critical mind and is neither dependent on proof nor impaired by vagueness. Sometimes faith uses rational terms when it is to be expressed as a creed. But these terms are only a varnish and do not penetrate its essence. The believing man is usually indifferent to the origin or foundations of his faith. He often shuns demonstrations or perception of 407</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW what is hidden from the natural eye and prefers the loyalty of faith to the clarity of knowledge. Knowledge is not an all-inclusive power. The cry of a starving person, "I am hungry," is not adequately described when regarded merely as a logical assertion. Not all that is evident is capable of being demonstrated. My feeling of sorrow, evident to myself, can hardly be proved. Or who can prove that the sun will rise tomorrow or that winter will follow autumn? Religious faith precedes and tran- scends knowledge. It is an ultimate force in man, lying deeper than the stratum of reason and its nature cannot be defined in abstract, static terms. It is a sense of the tran- scendent, a dynamic quality, the ability to envision the invisible, to be stirred by what lies beyond the reach of reason or perception. It is a manifestation of man's posi- tion on the verge of God.59 Unlike knowledge, which is a quiet possession of the intellect, faith is an overwhelm- ing force that enables man to perceive the reality of the transcendent. It is not only the assent to a proposition but the staking of the whole life on the truth of an invisible reality. Formulated belief is an attempt to translate into words an unutterable spiritual reality. We should never forget that any attempt to vindicate belief does not deal with the original reality but with the translation; it tries to integrate an imitation into the system of original logical symbols. 59 See A. Heschel, An Analysis of Piety, Review of Religion, IX (1942), pp. 293-307; The Holy Dimension, The Journal of Religion, XXII (1943), pp. 117-124.
