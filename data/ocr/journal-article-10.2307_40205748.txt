The survey was carried out under the auspices of the Cornell Halai and East Lokris Project (CHELP) in 1988 and 1989, and the finds were studied by the authors between 2000 and 2003. Pottery and small finds indicate that Mitrou was one of the major Bronze Age sites in the region, occupied from Early Helladic II through the Protogeometric period without interruption, and benefiting from trading contacts throughout the Aegean. INTRODUCTION The Cornell Halai and East Lokris Project (CHELP) carried out a sur- face survey on the island of Mitrou in 1988 and 1989 under the direction of John Coleman and William Murray, who generously gave the authors permission to publish the collected material.1 Mitrou, a tidal islet in the bay of Atalanti in East Lokris, is located on a land and sea corridor connecting 1. Margaretha Kramer-Hajos studied the pottery (summers of 2000, 2001, and 2003, and fall of 2002) and Kerill O'Neill the small finds (summers of 2000, 2001, and 2003). We are grateful above all to John Coleman (Cornell University) and William Murray (University of South Florida). Various scholars offered advice in the course of preparing this article. Eleni Zahou and Olga Kyriazi of the 14th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Clas- sical Antiquities were extremely helpful in offering parallels from the nearby site of Proskynas, whose finds are cur- rently being studied for publication. Jeremy Rutter shared his expertise and gave many useful insights on the pot- tery from Mitrou. We also benefited greatly from the expertise of Lia Kar- imali in evaluating the lithics. We further thank illustrators Yuki Furuya (CHELP volunteer in 2000) and Mary-Jane Schumacher (INSTAP Center on East Crete, 2002). Volun- teers assisting with cataloguing were Lois Berkowitz (2000) and Sara Schrage (2002, 2003). We must also thank William Murray and Grigorios Tsokas for kindly providing us with their unpublished manuscripts on the survey methodology and the methodol- ogy and results of the electrical resis- tivity and electrical tomography survey, respectively. We are also grateful to the anonymous Hesperia reviewers for their insightful suggestions. Finally, we thank Phanouria Dakoronia, Maria- Photeini Papakonstantinou, Nina Kipa- rissi-Apostolika, Sonia Dimaki, Olga Kyriazi, and Eleni Zahou, current and former members of the 14th Epho- rate of Prehistoric and Classical An- tiquities at Lamia for their kindness, generosity, and expertise as we prepared this article.

Kramer-Hajos Thessaly with the southern part of central Greece (Figs. 1-3). The aim of the survey was to ascertain when Mitrou was first occupied, how long it was inhabited, and how the settlement changed over the course of time. The results indicate that Mitrou was inhabited and served as a major center from the Early Bronze Age through the Early Iron Age. Mitrou lies near the southernmost part of the bay of Atalanti, on the western shore of the North Euboian Gulf, 1.5 km north of the modern town of Tragana (Figs. 2, 3). It measures about 330 m north-south and 180 m east-west, and has a roughly balloon-shaped outline, covering an area of at least 3.6 ha. The highest point, about 12 m above sea level, is at the north end, where steep cliffs rise up from the sea. From there the islet slopes gently down toward the south (Fig. 1). The shoreline is sandy near the southern end, which at low tide stretches out in the form of a spit to Tragana beach, projecting ca. 0.25 m above the water. Most of the time, that is, at high tide, this spit is submerged under water up to 0.75 m deep. At its northern end, the shore of the islet is delimited by tall scarps. Numerous walls, floor levels, and cist tombs are visible in these scarps. The island is now divided into 16 different private plots. It is devoid of modern buildings, thanks to the Greek Archaeological Service, which designated Mitrou as an archaeological site in 1983. The southern end and northwestern side of the islet are covered with olive groves. The northeastern quarter was used for cultivation of grains but has lain fallow in recent years and is covered with dense undergrowth. Aerial photographs from 1972 and 1997 (Fig. 4) illustrate the transition from crop-farming to olive cultivation. The presence of numerous cut and shaped blocks in piles of stones on the sides of the islet and along the beaches suggests that plowing has done some damage to structures, at least in the later strata. At the behest of the Greek Archaeological Service, deep plowing has been banned since the late 1980s, perhaps contributing to the landowners' wan- ing interest in cultivating the islet.

Coleman Mitrou is now a tidal islet but in prehistory the shoreline extended farther into the bay. Sea level was probably at least 10 m lower in the area around Mitrou in the Late Bronze Age than today, due to a combination of global sea level change, subsidence of the land between Euboia and the mountain ranges on the mainland, and earthquakes.2 Thus, Mitrou was once a low hill overlooking a coastal plain. The large, fertile coastal plain of Atalanti to the northwest (Fig. 3) is bounded on the south by a steep ridge of hills up to 500 m high. The area is rich in springs and creeks, and the hills contain iron ore.3 A number of springs bubble up from the sea floor around Mitrou, on the east, north, and northwest sides of the islet. Two major springs are located nearby, one west-northwest of Tragana at the point where the National Road is closest to the sea, and the other east of Tragana at the point where the Revenikos River flows into the sea (Fig. 3). These springs may be fed by the runoff from the Kopaic Basin and do not dry up even in summer. Late Bronze Age Mitrou certainly was in contact with the important LH site of Kynos, which lies ca. 10 km north-northwest of Mitrou, at the northern boundary of the plain of Atalanti near the modern town of Livanates (Figs. 2, 3). Interregional contacts with Boiotia and Phokis were facilitated by a number of natural routes.4 Thebes, less than 40 km to the southeast of Mitrou, can be reached from Orchomenos or from the plain 2. The estimate of 10 m is based on extrapolation from known data (see, e.g., Hafemann 1960a, 1960b; Flem- ming 1978; Lambeck 1996), especially in the Argolid (van Andel and Shack- leton 1982; van Andel 1989) and near Halai (Steven Soter, pers. comm.). For calculations, see Kramer-Hajos 2005, pp. 26-38. A geophysical survey to de- termine the ancient sea levels is needed. 3. Iron mines in the hills atTsoukka, south of Mitrou, were worked before World War II. Aerial conveyors, used for the transport of iron to the sea, form a line to Vivos; another line of aerial conveyors ended at Gaidaronisi, suggesting the presence of mines in the area of Neochori as well. 4.

From the northern part of the plain of Atalanti, the valley of the Daphnoremma River gives access to Kalapodi and Elateia in Phokis. Mitrou was first mentioned in the dissertation of Paul Girard, who noted worked stones (petrae effossae) and pottery fragments (innumerafic- tilium rerumfragmenta) around the mouth of the Revenikos River, to the east of Mitrou (Fig. 3).5 The island was subsequently investigated by Rainer Felsch in 1974-1975, who recognized remains dating from EH II-MH and LH IIIA-B.6 John Fossey added pottery finds dating to the Late Neolithic, Protogeometric, Geometric, and, tentatively, Classical periods.7 In the summers of 1988 and 1989, members of CHELP conducted an intensive surface survey covering most of the surface and beaches of Mitrou, the results of which are presented in this article.8 Connected with this survey was a magnetometer survey conducted by Steven Soter.9 In October 2003, in preparation for excavation by the Mitrou Archaeological Project (MAP), Grigorios Tsokas of Aristotle University in Thessaloniki carried out a geophysical survey over the northeastern part of the island, which revealed a dense network of walls. Excavations then began in the summer of 2004.10 Remains of Buildings and Tombs On the northeastern and northwestern sides of the islet, erosion from the sea has created vertical scarps that extend for stretches of 50 m or more and show the remains of ancient buildings, floors, and tombs (Fig. 5). These deposits are up to 4 m deep in the northern part of the island. The scarps suffer from looting and from the incessant erosion caused by the sea and the wind. As a result, tombs that were visible in the scarp a decade ago have now tumbled down the scarp, their slabs lying on the beach below (Fig. 6). In 1989 student volunteers of CHELP recorded eight looted cist tombs on the western side of the island;11 at least two more were visible in the northeastern scarp. Some of the cist tombs may date to the MH period, but it is possible that a number of the ones located on the northwest shore at a lower level, at the low tide line and most of the time covered by the sea, date to the EH period. One tomb on the eastern side, which collapsed in the winter of 1999-2000, may be Mycenaean, given its carefully worked slabs (Fig. 6) and the presence of a large Early Mycenaean sherd (Dl, see catalogue below) with fresh breaks found in the spill below the tomb.12 Nevertheless, we are mindful that cist tombs were used throughout the Bronze Age and into the Early Iron Age. During the LH period the place of burial may have been moved else- where: Mycenaean chamber tombs are located 2.5 km away on the hillside of nearby Tragana, on the way up to the monastery of AyiaTriada (Fig. 3). Eight have been investigated by the Greek Archaeological Service13 and are likely to represent the cemetery for Mycenaean Mitrou. The bones from multiple burials within these chamber tombs have been compared with bones from various other Mycenaean sites in Lokris, and they indicate that the people of Mitrou enjoyed better nutrition, endured less physical hard- ship, and lived significantly longer than other Lokrians of the period.14 In the area above the northeastern tombs, two walls can be seen jutting out of the scarp (Fig. 5, "room"). They are built of unworked hard fieldstones 5. Girard 1881, p. 39. 6. In Schachermeyr 1976a, pp. 218, 271; 1976b, p. 176. 7. Fossey 1990, p. 50. 8.

Visible features on Mitrou. Photo Greek Army Geographical Service, courtesy J. E. Coleman; adapted by M. Kramer-Hajos ca. 0.20 m long, roughly fitted together. Here, too, erosion and looting have taken their toll. Although hardly visible today, a decade ago it was still clear that the two walls formed the corner of a room that is presently outside the scarp. A MH bronze ax (C35) and some other small finds were recovered from fresh spill below a tomb robber s tunnel dug along the floor level within the corner of the room. South of this structure, more walls are visible in the scarp. In one case, individual mudbricks are clearly visible in situ above the stone sockle (Fig. 7). Alternating floor levels, visible as lines of cobbles or clay, and ash deposits are present as well. On the southwestern beach, a large worked slab of sandstone con- glomerate beach rock, measuring ca. 2.5 x 0.8 x 0.4 m and with a deep orthogonal cutting on its northern end, is reminiscent of a lintel stone. On the southeastern beach several stone blocks, ca. 0.3 x 0.3 m in size, show evidence of hammer marks. In the shallow waters west of the islet, walls are visible (Fig. 5).</page><page sequence="7">THE BRONZE AGE SITE OF MITROU 169 Figure 6. Worked slabs from cist tomb as visible in 2003. Photo M. Kramer-Hajos Figure 7. Sockle and mudbricks in northeastern scarp. Photo K. O'Neill The geophysical survey conducted by Tsokas s team yielded impres- sive evidence for architectural remains on Mitrou.15 Electrical resistivity mapping in the northeastern part of the islet revealed an extensive net- work of elongated anomalies at a depth of less than a meter. In general, these anomalies have an approximately northeast-southwest alignment or are perpendicular to that. It seems reasonable to interpret this pattern of rectilinear and orthogonal features as structures in a town grid. Some of the longest stretches (up to 30 m long) may represent enclosure walls for some sort of inner citadel, or possibly terrace walls; several rooms of various sizes are visible as well. Given the shallow depth of these struc- tures, one can assume that they are associated with the later occupation of the site. Apart from these structures, electric resistivity tomography16 detected several structures near the northeastern shore at a depth of 1.5-3.5 m. Ex- cavation is needed to ascertain the chronology of the structures identified by both geophysical techniques. 15. Our brief summary is based on Tsokas's 2003 report to the Lamia Ephorate and MAP. The survey was carried out in cooperation with Nina Kyparissi-Apostolika and the 14th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, and arranged with Tsokas by Eleni Zahou, Olga Kyriazi, and Kerill O'Neill. Funding was generously provided by the Institute for Aegean Prehistory; the results will appear in Hesperia (Van de Moortel et al., forth- coming). 16.

The goal of this regional survey was to "record and study the archaeological and environmental evidence for human activity at and around ancient Halai from the beginning of the Neolithic period through Byzantine times."17 The following description of the survey design is based on the field notes and the subsequent written report of the survey by Wil- liam Murray; since there are no plans to publish a report on the survey methodology, we describe here the survey design and its implementation as we can reconstruct them to the best of our ability.18 Three different types of collection techniques were practiced: tract samples (TS), grab samples (GS), and vacuum samples (VS). Tract samples were the largest artifact collection units, delimited by natural features and modern field boundaries. Team members spaced approximately 10 m apart searched the ground in the area accessible to each member s outstretched arms for artifacts and collected all diagnostic artifacts encountered along their path. For the purposes of this survey, diagnostics were defined as ceramic rims, handles, and bases; sherds with incised, impressed, painted, plastic, or glazed decoration; or any oddly shaped item (whether pottery or not) that was not immediately recognizable. Small finds (e.g., chipped stone, glass, bone, metal) were also included in the sample. As a first step in the survey, eight tracts were laid out (C2-601 to C2- 608): four on the surface of the islet and four along the shoreline (Fig. 8).19 Tracts C2-601, C2-603, and C2-604 were olive groves; C2-602 was a recently harvested wheat field. In addition, the sandy spit connecting Mitrou to the Tragana beach was rich in chipped stone and was assigned the number C2-600. For finds collected by chance during informal visits to the island, the identifying number C2-609 was created. In 1989, a new tract sample was collected on freshly plowed, formerly inaccessible land in the southwestern part of the island, designated C2-610. The five tracts on the surface of the islet (C2-601 to C2-604, and C2- 610, i.e., not the beach tracts) were different shapes and sizes, and different numbers of people were assigned to walk them.20 Visibility ranged from excellent (80%-100%) for tracts that had been recently plowed (C2-603, C2-604, and C2-610) to fair (40%-60%) or poor (less than 20%) where the land lay fallow (C2-601 and C2-602). The northeastern part of the island (i.e., north of C2-602 and east of C2-604) had lain fallow for some time and was covered with particularly dense ground cover, offering 0% visibility. For this reason, it was not surveyed. The beach tracts (C2-605 to C2-608) were not sampled in the same way due to their narrow and winding shape and their rocky terrain. There was no possibility of people walking side by side at 10 m intervals: at low tide the beach is only 3-4 m wide. Collection of artifacts on the beach tracts had more in common with a grab sample; as many students as pos- sible combed every inch of the shoreline. The northern beach quadrants were particularly rich in finds due to erosion of the scarps and the illicit digging of tombs. 17. W. Murray, internal CHELP report. 18. Since the primary aim of the surface survey was not to record the density of artifact types in the area, but to determine the periods of habitation represented, the survey methodology seems to have borrowed little from contemporary survey projects in Boiotia (BintlifT1985, 1986; Bintliff and Snodgrass 1985) and on Keos (Cherry, Davis, and Mantzourani 1991). For this reason, a direct comparison with other survey projects is difficult. The large quantity and fine quality of much of the Mitrou material may even have been a drawback: the temptation to collect only the most striking pieces in freshly plowed fields must have been strong. 19. Under the CHELP system for dividing up the survey region into man- ageable map sheets for separate teams of fieldwalkers, Mitrou fell onto sheet C2-6. Thus, the eight Mitrou tracts are numbered from C2-601 to C2-608. 20. Nine people walked C2-601, 10 people walked C2-602, the largest of the tracts, seven walked C2-603, and only three people walked C2-604, the smallest and narrowest of the tracts. In 1989, three people walked C2-610.</page><page sequence="9">THE BRONZE AGE SITE OF MITROU VJ1 Figure 8. Tracts and grid squares; grab sample indicated by X. Adapted from CHELP survey map; M. Kramer- Hajos Since an unusually high concentration of specific or significant arti- facts was found on Mitrou, the site was subdivided into smaller units con- sisting of 20 x 20 m grid squares established on a north- south axis over the surface, complete with individual coordinates (Fig. 8). Grid squares in which artifact density was expected to be high, and visibility 40% or higher, were selected for grab sampling. Team members walked over the entire surface of each individual square, collecting a grab sample of every diagnostic artifact. In some cases, a grab sample was collected from two adjacent squares (e.g., in D/E 3 and H/1 2), where more than half of each individual square, on the edge of the scarp, was impossible to survey. The joining of two squares was intended to create plots of roughly equal size for grab sampling. Although designed to provide a broadly representative selection of the types of pottery and small finds in a particular area, in practice both tract and grab samples resulted in skewed samples, since sherds from some periods and small finds of particular materials are not always equally recognizable. To counteract the possibility of missing evidence of a particular period or of overlooking important information about a site, the teams employed a</page><page sequence="10">172 MARGARETHA KRAMER-HAJOS AND KERILL O'NEILL third sampling methodology. From a circle with a diameter of 3 m in the center of a grid square, all ground cover was removed, and every artifact, bone, and shell (ancient, modern, or undetermined) was meticulously collected, effectively "vacuumed up," and retained as a vacuum sample. Thus, the vacuum sample serves as a control for any collection biases in the tract sample or grab sample, and compensates for the differing abili- ties of individuals to identify artifacts in the course of collecting a grab or tract sample.21 In seven cases where only a small area of the grid square was clear enough for survey, it was determined that it was not feasible to collect vacuum samples.22 Upon completion of the GS and TS, the team leader or recorder dis- carded undiagnostic sherds and any non-artifacts at the grid square or tract from which they came. Many of the stone finds, whether ground or chipped, received the same treatment, with the reasoning that these items are harder to ascribe to a specific time period than diagnostic pottery and are in that respect undiagnostic. The most interesting finds of all three sample types were selected for cataloguing and received field numbers according to their findspot and the type of find represented;23 other material was bagged and labeled with sample type, findspot, and collection date. In retrospect, tract sampling may not have been an appropriate meth- odology for Mitrou, which was already known to be a site. The sheer size of the tracts prevents, in many cases, a clear picture of artifact distribution (see below), which makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the development of specific parts of the site or the functions of different areas within the site. Linked to this shortcoming is the limitation of grab samples to squares where artifact density was judged high before undertaking the GS. Another drawback of the survey was the exclusion of the northeastern quarter of the island.24 Finally, the fact that much of the chipped and ground stone was discarded after collection means that the conclusions that can be drawn about the stone industry and use patterns are necessarily limited. The survey methods do, however, succeed in answering the research questions: when was Mitrou first inhabited, for how long did habitation last, and, to some extent, how did the settlement change over time? Detailed questions concerning, for example, the layout of the settlement are more difficult to answer. 21. Stone artifacts, in particular, were hard for some collectors to identify. 22. Vacuum survey was not under- taken in C4, D4, and G6 due to poor visibility. In C/D6 and D/E3, the pick- up areas were too narrow to accommo- date the 3 m diameter of the VS. In C6, a localized GS was collected from the area around illicit digging that had presumably been conducted by someone looking for antiquities. Apart from the crude hole and pile of excavated earth, C6 was covered in dense undergrowth, so no VS was performed. No VS took place in E4 either. 23. E.g., the first sherd selected for cataloguing found in tract 608 would receive the number C2-608.01; the third selected sherd found in grid C5 would receive the number M-C5.03 (M for Mitrou). Small finds would receive an x before their individual number, e.g., M-C5.x01 for the first selected small find from grid C5. 24. A detailed surface survey of the northeastern part of Mitrou has been initiated by MAP, concurrent with the excavation.</page><page sequence="11">THE BRONZE AGE SITE OF MITROU 173 TABLE 1.

Most material was found in grid squares E4, F4, F5, G2-G5, H3-H5, H/I2, and 15, and in the south central part (L6, M6, and M7). Of the 644 inventoried sherds, most were found in the northwestern corner (squares D5-G5 and H3); very few of the sherds collected from the south central area were inventoried. The overall paucity of inventoried material from surface tracts is a direct result of the survey methodology, which favored the beach tracts and grab samples. For this reason, the comparison of material densities is often not possible. Another caveat is provided by three sherds belonging to the same vessel (D96, D97), but found in two grid squares (C5, F5), evidence that plowing of the site had scattered sherds widely across the surface, possibly removing them far from the place where they were originally deposited. Only in cases where large numbers of certain types of sherds are concentrated in a certain area may we tentatively draw conclusions based upon their distribution. Thus, some observations can be made. The overwhelming majority of the inventoried EH material was col- lected in the tract system: 115 sherds, as opposed to 10 sherds in the grid system (Figs. 9, 10:a). Of all inventoried EH tract samples, no less than two-thirds (77 sherds) come from tract 605 (the northeastern beach quad- rant), 17 from 606, 13 from 608, and the remaining few from tracts 602 and 607, and as chance finds (Fig. 9). The only examples from Mitrou of Ayia Marina ware (B31, B32) are from 608 (the northwestern beach quadrant). These beach tracts are located on those parts of the shore where erosion is heaviest: the northern half and the eastern part of the island.25 It is to be expected that EH material would be found on the shores of the island rather than inland; with erosion of the scarps, the lower strata dissolve and tumble down onto the shore, whereas in the interior, they are protected. 25. Tract 606 spans the southern two-thirds of the eastern shoreline, the upper part of which is subject to heavy erosion. Since the exact location of finds within a tract has not been recorded, it is not certain that most sherds from tract 606 were found in the northern part of this tract, but that would seem the most likely.</page><page sequence="12">174 MARGARETHA KRAM E R- H AJO S AND KERILL O'NEILL TABLE 2.

Distribution of inventoried pottery within tracts, by period (black = EH, light gray = MH, medium gray = LH, dark gray = PG). M. Kramer-Hajos For the MH material the picture is similar, although not as pronounced: 65 inventoried sherds were collected in the tract system, 19 in the grid system (Figs. 9, 10:b). Of the 65 TS sherds, 61 were found in the beach tracts: 41 are from tract 605, 13 from 606, and 7 from 608. Perhaps more significantly, of the 19 GS sherds, no fewer than 16 are from the C-G grid squares in the northern part of the island. The most remarkable MH sherd, a zoomorphic handle (C20), comes from 604 (a surface tract overlapping with the C-G5 squares); two fine examples of Red-Burnished ware (Cl and C2) are from square C6 and C2-605, and most of the better Gray Minyan sherds are from C2-605 or square C6 as well. Although their numbers are low, the small finds also suggest that the MH settlement is limited to the northern, high end of the island. Most LH inventoried sherds were collected in the grid system (111 tract samples versus 204 grid samples; Figs. 9, 10:c [Fig. 10:c includes only the 190 fine-ware sherds]). Since Mitrou was essentially uninhabited after the Early Iron Age,26 the LH material lies close to the surface of the soil, unprotected by later layers. Human activity such as plowing inevitably brings up more sherds from the upper layers than from the lower ones, accounting for the wealth of LH surface sherds compared to the dearth of EH surface material. Moreover, once plowed up, the wealth of decorated fine-ware sherds may have "blinded" the fieldwalkers to the often undecorated and coarser EH sherds. The LH samples from the southern part of Mitrou were abundant but of lesser quality and therefore often not inventoried. It is possible that the material originally deposited in the south was of lesser quality than vessels used and deposited in the northern half of the islet; another possibility is that LH sherds were turned up fresh in the northern, higher parts of the islet and were carried by wind and water down the slope to the south, losing their decoration and sharp edges on the way. Possibly, therefore, the observed distribution of decorated versus plain and LH versus EH fragments is largely due to erosion.27 26. PG material: 23 tract samples and 40 grid samples. 27. Unlike the LH sherds, the EH material often consisted of large unpainted handle, rim, and base frag- ments, which retain their diagnostic features even after long exposure to the elements.</page><page sequence="14">176 MARGARETHA KRAMER-HAJOS AND KERILL O'NEILL Figure 10.

Adapted from CHELP survey map; M. Kramer-Hajos Nevertheless, LH I- III fine-ware sherds are found predominantly in the northwestern part of the islet (Fig. 10:c).28 The southern part of this area overlaps with the two large adjoining rooms near the center of the geophysical survey area. Protogeometric sherds are thinly spread in the northwest quadrant (Fig. 10:d).29 The concentration of LH sherds in the northwestern area may be too great to be explained solely by coincidence or survey considerations. The survey in the northeastern part of the islet initiated by MAP should help resolve this issue. A comparison of the densities of certain types of LH vessels shows a concentration of fine "elite" wares in the C5-H5 vertical swathe (Fig. ll:a). 28. LH I: from grid numbers 3 through 6, with the greatest density in the north: eight out of 10 fine LH I sherds were located in grid squares C through H (with the remaining two in J and L, respectively). Four more LH I fine-ware sherds come from tracts 602 (one sherd), 604 (two sherds), and 606 (one sherd). LH II: of 19 sherds, 18 are located in grid squares C5-H5, C4, F4, and G4. The remaining piece was found in 19. The nine LH II fine-ware sherds from tract samples give a less clear picture, coming from the northwestern and central parts of the island in equal numbers. LH III: of 61 fine-ware sherds, 50 were picked up in C5-H5 and C/D6, G3, G4, and H3. Of these, 40 come from the C5-H5 vertical swathe. This picture is clear for the LH IIIA material (17 from C5-H5, 2 elsewhere in the northwestern corner, 6 elsewhere on the island), the LH IIIB material (12, 4, and 4, respectively), and the LH IIIC material (13, 4, and 6, re- spectively). The tract distribution is once again less clear: surprisingly, only one sherd (LH IIIC) comes from tract 604, which roughly overlaps with the C5-F5 vertical. This is probably due to survey mechanics: since the tract samples did not cover the ground completely, much material may have been missed. Eight sherds, all LH IIIA, were found in 608, six in 602, and four in 606. For sherds dated only generally to LH, the picture is similar (33, 29, and 7 sherds for the C5-H5 vertical, the rest of the northwestern quarter, and the rest of the site, respectively). The greatest density in tracts is found in 603 (9 sherds), 605 and 608 (7 sherds each), and 604 (6 sherds), indicating the greatest density in the northern half of the islet. 29. The tract distribution does not confirm this shift in density.</page><page sequence="16">178 MARGARETHA KRAMER-HAJOS AND KERILL O'NEILL Pithos fragments are thinly distributed southeast and southwest of this concentration; pan and tripod fragments are located in the southern part of this area and to the southeast and southwest of it (Fig. ll:b). The grid squares where elite wares are predominant have no or very few domestic or storage vessels.30 Of the eight LH figurine fragments recovered as grab samples from grid squares on the island surface, five come from the C5-I5 vertical area, and another two come from C4 and F4.31 It is tempting to suppose that from the inception of the Late Bronze Age, the northern, higher part of Mitrou housed the living quarters of rich Mycenaeans, with more utilitarian kitchen and storage structures just south of these, a bit lower down the slope. At the end of the Mycenaean era, these rich quarters might have been abandoned, as the scarcity of later material from this area suggests. THE POTTERY AND SMALL FINDS During the surface survey in 1988 and 1989, more than 600 sherds and 200 small finds were inventoried. Included in the following catalogue is a selection of sherds that are chronologically diagnostic and small finds that are diagnostic either for a period or for a certain activity. This selection has resulted in a heavy emphasis on decorated fine wares, not accurately reflecting the situation in the field.32 Pottery and small finds are grouped together by period.33 Diagnostic pottery fragments from the surface survey cover all periods from the Neo- lithic through the Byzantine period, but Bronze Age material dominates. The small amount of Geometric and later material collected during the survey is not indicative of habitation and has not been included in this article. 30. The tract distribution is less clear: most elite wares were found in tract 608 (8 sherds), but only one sherd comes from tract 604. Most domestic vessel fragments were found in tract 602, southeast of the area of great- est density (4 sherds). The number of sherds is small, however (with a total of 8 pan/tripod sherds), so it becomes statistically unwarranted to derive any conclusions from these data. 31. The other figurine fragments were recovered from beach tracts or were picked up as chance finds during informal visits to the island. 32. Given the methodology of the survey, a bias against coarse wares began at the time of pickup: fine- ware sherds, especially decorated or other- wise diagnostic ones, are more likely to have been noticed than the duller undecorated coarse fragments (for an extreme example, see Bintliff, Howard, and Snodgrass 1999) and, once col- lected, were more likely to be invento- ried and selected for cataloguing. Hence, almost all of the entries in the following catalogue are decorated fine wares, mostly from tract and grab sam- ples, while in the field undecorated wares dominate, as witnessed by the vacuum samples, which are largely made up of undecorated fine and coarse wares. 33. The periods and their corre- sponding catalogue designations are as follows: Neolithic (A), Early Helladic (B), Middle Helladic (C), Late Hellad- ic (D), Bronze Age (for items thought to hold some diagnostic value even though they could not be dated very closely) (E), and Protogeometric (F). Additional abbreviations used in the catalogue are int. (interior) and ext. (exterior). The method of fabrication is handmade for the Neolithic and EH material, and wheelmade for the MH and later material, unless otherwise stated. Inclusions are labeled by their color except in the case of limestone, quartz, biotite ("silver mica"), and muscovite ("gold mica"). The size of inclusions is based on a five-point scale: very small = &lt;0.1 mm, small = 0.1-1.0 mm, medium = 1.0-2.0 mm, large = 2.0-4.0 mm, and very large = &gt;4.0 mm. The density of inclusions is likewise based on a five-point scale: very few, few, moder- ate amount, many, and very many. The hardness of the fabric is indicated by reference to the Mohs scale.</page><page sequence="17">THE BRONZE AGE SITE OF MITROU IJ&lt;) Figure 12. Neolithic pottery. Scale ca. 1:1. Photo M.

Early Helladic Pottery Diagnostic Early Helladic pottery fragments from Mitrou include fine and semicoarse bowl fragments with incurved rim (Bl, B2, B5) and pellets (B1-B4), fine saucers (B6-B8 and B24-B26), fine and semicoarse sauceboats (B10-B13), semicoarse jars (B17-B20), handmade coarse and semicoarse fragments with loop handles (B21-B23), fragments with Kerbschnitt deco- ration (B14, B15), and sherds of possible Ayia Marina ware (B31, B32).</page><page sequence="18">l8o MARGARETHA KRAMER-HAJOS AND KERILL O'NEILL We have not securely identified an EH I phase, but three sherds (Bl, B9, B17) might date to EH I. Since their shape and fabric continue into EH II, however, we have erred on the side of caution and included them here with the EH II material. The EH II fine wares have very pale brown and pink to light reddish brown and reddish yellow fabrics and are fired medium hard (Mohs 3-4). The core is often bluish gray due to incomplete firing. Some have the shiny reddish to black Urfirnis coating, others are slipped or burnished. Shapes represented are bowls and saucers, sauceboats, a basin (B9), and a pyxis (B16). Semicoarse and coarse wares are used for bowls, jars, sauce- boats, and cooking pots in EH II. Firing is irregular: often one surface of a sherd is oxidized and the other reduced, but variations on one and the same surface occur as well. Only a small selection of fairly coarse frag- ments of baking pans or vessels with characteristic EH handle types or plastic decoration has been inventoried; the large number of such sherds in the uninventoried material suggests that the site was inhabited from the EH II period onward. Bowls, both semicoarse and fine, are commonly decorated with pellets. These are "comparatively rare" at Eutresis,34 but their frequency at Mitrou suggests that they were a quite common form of decoration here, as they were at Lerna on a variety of shapes.35 In one case (B2) a pellet is stuck on the rim, but in all other cases they are located just below the rim. A varia- tion of this feature is represented by B5, where a plastic ridge below the rim was possibly flanked by two small knobs, as in examples from nearby Proskynas.36 An example with pellets centered between two handles, from Proskynas now on display in the Atalanti museum, provides a parallel for B4. Other parallels are known from Keos.37 Saucers with inturned rim (B6-B8) are typical and well attested; par- allels are known from Eutresis, Lithares, and Manika.38 The large highly burnished rim fragment B9 belongs to a basin with diameter of ca. 30 cm and low profile.39 Three sauceboat spouts (B11-B13) attest to the common occurrence of fine sauceboats on Mitrou; BIO is evidence for the presence of semicoarse sauceboats. Proskynas has produced a number of vessels of this type, often with plastic decoration on the back.40 The example from Mitrou is decorated with a pellet. Two fragments with Kerbschnitt decoration have been recovered: B14, a fragment of bluish gray fabric coated with Urfirnis, has a very straight orientation but thin walls; and B15, a rim fragment, has parallels with Eu- tresis and Keos.41 The double pierced lugs of B16 are typical for EH small pyxides.42 The example from Mitrou has traces of reddish black Urfir- nis preserved. Jar shapes (B17-B20) are well known from Eutresis and Manika.43 The typical EH handle shape found at Mitrou is a large loop handle (B21-B23), vertically set, belonging to large jugs or jars; examples are attested at Eutresis and Manika as well.44 In the EH IIB phase, fine fabrics are more porous than previously, have more inclusions, and are warm yellow to red in color, with large gray cores. They can be slipped (B27) or burnished to a high shine (B24); the latter is very similar to highly burnished bowl fragments from Lithares.45 Three saucer fragments (B24-B26) and the base of a jar (B27) represent this period in the Mitrou assemblage. 34.

The Gray Minyan ware Bass bowl B28 is an example of the EH III predecessors of MH Gray Minyan ware. The shape is thought to have originated locally in central Greece.46 The example from Mitrou is somewhat rough and irregularly shaped. B30 has the tall, cylindrical profile characteristic of the depas amphiky- pellon, a wheel- thrown shape known from the latest stratum of Troy II and from Early Cycladic IIB- IIIA on Keros and Syros. Stumps of one of the two vertical loop handles are preserved. The sherd has smoothed edges, evidence that after breakage it was used for rubbing or polishing. Two light-on-dark pieces were found (B31, B32); both are small and do not have a clear profile, but they may represent Ayia Marina ware. Since Ayia Marina ware originated and is primarily found in central Greece, its presence at Mitrou connects Mitrou with mainland central Greece in EH III. It cannot be excluded, however, that they instead represent MH light-on-dark ware. Early Helladic II Bl Bowl (C2-608.29) PL. 0.076, p.W. 0.057, Diam. &gt;0.300,Th. 0.007-0.010 m.

Photo M. Kramer-Hajos</page><page sequence="25">THE BRONZE AGE SITE OF MITROU 187 Early Helladic Small Finds The Early Helladic group of small finds comprises a bead, a celt, a figurine fragment, and a terracotta spindle whorl. Stone The only bead assigned to the EH period exhibits significant signs of wear around the piercing (B33), suggesting a long period of use. Beads of the same material and shape were recovered during the excavation of EH strata at the site of Proskynas. One celt (B34) is included even though there is some doubt as to its provenance. It was recovered on the Tragana beach opposite the spit that stretches from Mitrou toward the shore, an area with many sherds. But as trucks had recently been dumping crushed rock as the foundation for a new road along the beach, the possibility remains that the celt comes from the location where the crushed rock was gathered rather than from Mitrou. Only the cutting edge and a strip about a centimeter wide abutting that edge have been polished, while the rest of the surface is covered with pecking marks. Stroulia has observed at Franchthi that this differential treatment of the distal and proximal ends (i.e., the cutting and hafting ends of the celt) permits more efficient manufacturing, and does not diminish the efficacy of the tool; that some celts are ground over their entire surface and others not, however, leads Stroulia to speculate that the differential treatment of the ends may be as much about personal preference or hafting techniques as about manufacturing efficiency.47 On the basis of their examination of 1,000 ground stone tools from Euboia, Sampson and Sugaya proposed a typology of ground stone axes based primarily on length, since length is crucial in determining the "func- tional capability" of the tool. They identified seven different groups: the smallest axes in Greece (group I) measure 4-6 cm, while the largest axes (group VII) measure 25-30 cm.48 The example from Mitrou is 7 cm long, placing it firmly in group II (6-8 cm), by far the most numerous type, ac- counting for almost half of the axes studied from Euboia. Sampson and Sugaya separately identify five different morphological forms of axes: oval, shoelast, triangle, trapezoid, and cylindrical. Once again, the Mitrou ax falls into the most common group, the shoelast (type b), which accounts for nearly two- thirds of the ax forms from Euboia. The edge profile bevels symmetrically to the edge point, the side lines curve gradually to the butt end, the edge line is straight, and the section is biconvex and oblong. A sandstone object (B35) might be interpreted as a portion of a schematic gynecomorphic figurine. An incised line on the front, back, and bottom of the stone appears to define the female form. The surface of the stone is soft and worn, and the details are hard to distinguish. Two depressions, one above the other, on one side may represent the navel and pubic hair. On the other side there is a deep broad hollow, which may represent the small of the back. The groove on this side is deeper than on the "front" side, and it may be intended to indicate the buttocks. It is a unique piece with no close comparanda, but the crude representation of the female pudenda and buttocks by grooves recalls an unstratified rough limestone figurine from Corinth.49 47. Stroulia 2003, p. 10. 48. Sampson and Sugaya 1988- 1989, pp. 12-15. Sampson and Sugaya classify smaller ground stone tools as adzes or chisels because of their asym- metrical profiles, a distinction rejected by Stroulia (2003) in her study of the Franchthi celts. 49.

Terracotta Only one terracotta small find has been dated to the EH period: a spindle whorl (B36) typical of EH spindle whorls in central and southern Greece.50 It is unslipped, unburnished, and worn, possibly from exposure to waves on the shore; the base is blackened by burning. It is comparable in shape and size to an EH spindle whorl from Eutresis,51 and close to the shape, 50. Cf. Banks 1967, pp. 491, 495, 524-525; Carington Smith 2000, pp. 217-218. 51.

Middle Helladic Pottery The MH pottery is represented by many pieces of Gray Minyan ware: 49 pieces have been inventoried and many more fragments are present in the uninventoried material.54 Red-Burnished (C1-C3) and Matt-Painted wares (C28-C34) are present as well, though not in large numbers. The slip of the Red-Burnished pieces flakes off easily. The high burnish on Cl and C2 is reminiscent of Red-Burnished vessels from Eutresis.Two of the three Red-Burnished pieces (Cl, C3) have muscovite inclusions, identifying them as Aiginetan imports. Muscovite inclusions have not been identified in the Mitrou material before the MH period. Several large sherds of fine Gray Minyan come from the immediate vi- cinity of cist tombs, which suggests they belonged to vessels deposited as grave goods. Characteristic shapes are (ring-stemmed) goblets and kantharoi, ring stems being characteristic of MH II- III Gray Minyan in central Greece. Only a fraction of these were catalogued; the large amounts of material sug- gest extensive settlement of the site in MH times. Gray Minyan handles may have plastic decoration at the base, imitating metal rivets (e.g., C17- C19). C17 is almost identical to a handle from a surface survey at Skala Atalantis currently on display in the museum in Atalanti. Other parallels are known from Pteleon.55 C18 has a flat back, and C19 a hollowed back. An interesting piece is C20, a zoomorphic handle. The handle is crudely shaped into an animal head and originally had two plastic pellets for eyes, one preserved and the other indicated by a scar. The shaping of the head/handle is very rough and irregular. Possibly the pellets originated as imitations of metal rivets, in which a creative potter saw eyes, thus giv- ing rise to the animal shape of this Gray Minyan handle.56 Zoomorphic protomes originating from sauceboat spouts are well attested for the EH II period;57 they sometimes decorate the base of a handle on an askos or jug, and, in the case of a small stone vase from Tiryns, one serves as a handle.58 We do not know of a similar treatment of handles in the Middle Helladic and so this zoomorphic handle might in fact be Early Helladic. Another handle fragment, C13, may be Early Helladic as well, as suggested by its incised decoration. Matt-Painted ware is less common than Gray Minyan, although it is possible that it has been overlooked because the paint has deteriorated. The Matt-Painted ware from Mitrou is often very worn, and slip and paint have flaked off, sometimes to the extent that the original design is barely noticeable (e.g., C29, C30). C29 is decorated with a pattern attested also at Pteleon.59 52. Carington Smith 2000, pp. 217- 218, no. SF280, fig. 4:32 (misnumbered as SF290 in the figure).

Middle Helladic Small Finds The Middle Helladic small finds include a bronze ax, a stone chisel mold, an arrow- straightener, a grooved stone tool, five terracotta spindle whorls, and a terracotta spool. Metal A bronze ax (C35) was found with two stone tools (an arrow-straightener, C37, and another tool of unknown function) in fresh spill immediately below the corner of a room or house in the scarp above beach tract C2- 605. This room had been exposed by erosion, and robbers had dug a small tunnel (Diam. ca. 15 cm) at floor level along the inside of one of the walls. The chisel mold was found nearby during a subsequent visit to the islet, and the possibility remains that they both came from this room. The bronze ax, a wedge-shaped flat ax narrowing toward a flat butt of medium width, is a type produced throughout the Aegean from the 19th century B.C. through the Mycenaean period.60 Cast in a one-piece mold, this type exhibits significant variation in the size and shape of the cutting edge. Nevertheless, the cutting edge is always lunate to some degree and normally flanged. The flanges are the result of the fashioning of the cut- ting edge in the forge. Axes of this type would have been mounted in a slot cut into a wooden haft. Catling illustrates a very similar flat ax from a Middle Cypriot tomb at Lapithos.61 The relatively small size of this bronze tool might suggest that it could have served as a chisel, either mounted in a bone or horn handle, or used without a handle and struck with a stone or another metal tool.62 In Branigan s typology, for example, this item would be classified as a type III chisel, with comparable pieces known from Syros and Lesbos.63 Tripathi acknowledges the difficulty in distinguishing smaller flat axes from chisels.64 McGeehan Liritzis, however, stresses the different functions of chisels (shaping) and axes (chopping), and argues that the size and shape of the cutting edge determines whether the tool was designed for chopping or shaping.65 McGeehan Liritzis cites the physical law that pressure equals force exercised over the area of the striking point of the implement. Thus, the larger the cutting edge, the lower the pressure exercised, and the nar- rower the cutting edge, the greater the pressure exercised. Chisels require concentrated pressure and therefore have a narrower cutting edge. Departing from the arbitrary or undefined division between axes and chisels made by earlier scholars, McGeehan Liritzis standardizes the distinction by arguing that the ratio of length to maximum width can be used to determine whether a tool is an ax or a chisel. She posits that the length divided by the maximum width (L./max. W.) of Aegean axes is less than 4.4 cm, and for chisels anything above. Following this method, which has the advantage of attempting to deduce function and of standardizing 60. For the typology, see Catling 1964, p. 63, fig. 4. See also Demako- poulou 1988, p. 265. 61.

O'Neill the distinction between axes and chisels, the Mitrou bronze tool (with a L./max. W. ratio of 3.03) is an ax. We can further classify it as type A2 on the basis of its concave sides, narrowing to a straight or mildly rounded butt, its convex cutting edge, flat profile, and rectangular section.

Stone The bronze ax (C35) may have been imported, but the stone chisel mold (C36) demonstrates that Mitrou was the site of metallurgy. There may be traces of copper in the base of the mold. The nearest copper sources are in Thessaly, southern Attica, and the southeastern tip of Euboia.66Thus, this mold implies the importation to Mitrou of ore or processed copper from some distance. The mold is a bivalve type; two holes served to secure the extant half to another joining piece, which had projecting pegs designed to fit into those holes. The hollow in the mold suggests that the chisel would have had a very steep cutting edge with just a 2 mm difference between the cutting edge and the top of the tool. It was unusual to cast chisels in a two-piece mold, which was usually employed for artifacts that could not be cast in a one-piece mold, such as double axes or spearheads.67 The arrow-straightener (C37) is a flattened ovoid stone with a single groove running the length of the stone, polished smooth by rubbing. In the middle of the opposite side of the stone is an indentation, possibly from pounding. The other stone tool (C38) found with the arrow-straightener initially appears to have had a similar function but is of a much softer sandstone, and the groove dips in the middle, making it unlikely that it could have served the purpose of smoothing an arrow shaft.

Terracotta Various types of Bronze Age terracotta objects are usually associated with textiles: pierced sherd disks, spindle whorls, small clay ring weights, clay spools, loomweights, and clay anchors. No clay anchors or ring weights have been identified at Mitrou but artifacts traditionally identified as spindle whorls have been assigned to each of the three periods in the Bronze Age, and a spool has been assigned to the MH period. The five spindle whorls and spool (C39- C44) can be considered as evidence of weaving industry at Mitrou in the MH period.68 It is not al- ways possible to distinguish beads from spindle whorls, so they have been included here, too. In practice, we have simply assumed that some of the smallest of these pierced whorls are intended for decorative use as beads. It is also possible that some of the "spindle whorls or beads" are actually dress weights or buttons. C39 and C40 are biconical. Carington Smith observes that, whereas biconical whorls are found in all phases of the Bronze Age in northern Greece and Macedonia, in central Greece and the Peloponnese they are common in the MH and LH periods only.69 C39 and C40 exhibit very similar incised decoration: a spiral or concentric circles encompass the hole at the bottom of the lower cone, and a series of concentric semicircles ring the rest of the lower cone.70 C39 has a vertical incision between each set of concentric semicircles. In her volume on Eutresis, Goldman suggests that "the small biconical clay button decorated with simple incised pat- terns, frequently rilled with white pigment, is as distinctive of this period [MH] as the Minyan pottery, and the material of which they are made is sometimes the same smooth grey clay."71 C40 is formed of a smooth gray clay, while C39 has a light reddish brown clay. C41 is a straight-sided, truncated cone of a type found in both EH and MH strata.72 The last item in the MH group is a spool (C44), a type strongly as- sociated with the Middle Helladic.73 Unlike many so-called spools, this particular type, perforated along its long axis and marked by concave sides, may well have been used as a reel for thread or yarn. 68. The terminology and classifi- cation for these items follows Banks 1967. 69. Carington Smith 2000, p. 217. 70. Two very similarly decorated whorls were found at Eutresis: Gold- man 1931, p. 198, pl.

A single Gray Minyan sherd, Dl, is a large piece with the shine and soapy feel that characterize the best pieces of this class. Its profile, with a smooth curve and a flaring lip, suggests it belongs to the LH I period rather than to the MH period.75 Found on the eastern shore beneath a cist tomb, it may belong to a vessel deposited as a grave gift. D2, the bridge spout of an Aiginetan hole-mouthed jar, closely follows the MH Matt-Painted tradition: the fabric is fairly coarse, pale in color, and the painted decoration consists of black bands. It dates to the transitional period of MH IIIB-LH IA.76 The bichrome sherds from Mitrou (D3-D12) are reminiscent of Shaft Grave ware. They have an orange-colored fabric (except for D8, which is brownish gray) and are slipped on the outside. D8 and D9 have a rough and irregular interior. Apart from D5, D7, and D12, they are polished to a nice shine. D6 (and possibly D8) were polished after the paint was applied: the entire surface is smooth and shiny and the black lines smear slightly onto the lighter background. On all other pieces the paint was applied after burnishing: the painted surface is rough to the touch and lines are crisp without smearing. The added paint is black, red, and brown, and shows simple geometric patterns and lightly curving bands. Dietz suggests a Boiotian origin for this class, based on its distribution and on provenance studies.77 The lustrous Mycenaean LH I style is represented by a sherd from an alabastron (D13),78 and by a few Vapheio cup fragments (D14-D16, and possibly D17) with the distinctive projecting horizontal ridge in the center of the body and painted ripple decoration. The sherds are thin - between 3 and 4 mm - and their fabric is very fine, without any inclusions. They have the typical Mycenaean light slip, on which lustrous dark (reddish brown to black) paint is applied. All three fragments are slipped and polished on the outside and unworked on the inside, as is standard in LH I open vessels. D17 is painted on the inside, which may place it in the LH II phase; the decoration, however, is more typical for LH I. A semiglobular cup fragment (D18) is unworked on the inside except for a painted band around the rim and may therefore belong to LH I as well; the paint on the exterior flakes off. These fragments represent the "true" Mycenaean LH style thus far barely represented in this part of Greece.79 The only example Mountjoy lists from Phthiotis is a Vapheio cup sherd from Drachmani-Piperi, deco- rated with a ripple pattern.80 From Boiotia she lists altogether one vessel and two linear sherds from Orchomenos and one sherd decorated with a ripple from Eutresis.81 For Euboia,Thessaly, and Phokis, no LH I pottery is listed at all. With several fragments from surface survey alone, Mitrou is therefore unusually rich in LH I material. 74.

Late Helladic II The number of recovered sherds increases in the LH II phase and both LH IIA and IIB are well represented. For most sherds the decoration, rather than the shape, is the diagnostic feature. Marine (especially in LH IIA) and floral patterns occur next to monochrome-painted pieces and pieces painted with dot-lined stripes. In most cases the clay contains no inclusions; where inclusions are present, they are rare, small, and usually limestone. Most fine ware sherds are slipped and sometimes polished; decoration is applied with red, brown, or black lustrous paint on the off-white to orange slip. Perhaps the most striking LH IIA marine-decorated sherd is D23, which shows a Minoanizing octopus or argonaut. This Marine Style is rare in central Greece,82 but does appear in Athens.83 Whether the vessel was a local product or an import (fabric and slip are of a deeper orange than those of other sherds from this period), it shows that, as in the LH I period, now too, Mitrou was an important site that had connections with regions to its south and east rather than west and north. It is similar in decoration to D21, a (stirrup) jar shoulder fragment, though D21, like D22, is polished and has red paint. D26, D27, and D34 have a burned gray surface with black marine patterns; one may wonder whether the gray firing of vessels with marine motifs was intentional and meant to imitate the color of the sea. The prime LH IIB piece from Mitrou is D29, a large rim fragment from an Ephyraean goblet painted with a lily. Closed LH II shapes are jugs (D19), stirrup jars (D20-D22), piriform jars (D23), and alabastra (D28, D34). Among the open shapes, goblets (D29, D30, D35) make their appearance and the Vapheio cup continues, now with foliate bands diagnostic of LH II Vapheio cups (D31, D32, D36,D37). 82.

Late Helladic III The number of recovered sherds culminates in abundant quantities of inventoried LH III examples. Within LH III, quantities slightly decrease from LH III A to LH IIIC. Typical well-represented shapes are stirrup jars (both in the large and fairly crudely made version and in the small fine version) and kylikes, often painted with whorl shells. Many kylix stems have survived, for obvious reasons. The whorl shell is by far the most popular motif; other motifs are flowers, octopuses, and argonauts. As in LH II, fine wares are usually slipped with off-white, buff, yellowish or brownish orange slip. Paint is mostly lustrous red in IIIA, brown or black in IIIB, and black or dull orange in IIIC. Fabrics are pale pink to whitish yellowish in LH IIIA. In LH IIIB they can still be very pale, but darker pinkish and buff fabrics appear as well. LH IIIC fabrics are generally a dark pink to buff color. New shapes in LH IIIA that are well represented on Mitrou are mostly associated with drinking: the mug, the kylix, the krater, and the stemmed bowl, which first appears in LH IIIA2. Among the closed shapes, alabastra, (piriform) jars, and stirrup jars remain popular. D48 is a large part of a fine very small stirrup jar used for perfumed oil.84 D74, D75, and D76 have the ridged rim diagnostic of LH IIIA2 large mugs. Typical LH IIIAl motifs represented on Mitrou are spirals, bands, nets, stipples, and fish scales. LH IIIA2 motifs are the horizontal whorl shell on kylikes, foliate bands, wavy bands on stemmed bowls, quirks, chevrons, and a flower (D62). A generic LH IIIA sherd (D67) is decorated with bands on both the interior and the exterior. Late Helladic IIIAl D38 Large piriform jar (M-E5.24) Fig. 28 P.L. 0.040, fl.W. 0.026, Th. 0.05-0.006 m.

Sherds belonging certainly to LH IIIB come from deep bowls, the charac- teristic vessel for the IIIB period, kraters, stirrup jars, kylikes, and miniature vessels. Elsewhere in Greece deep bowls take over the dominant position from the kylix, but the surface material from Mitrou does not confirm this shift. The LH IIIB material from Mitrou is slightly less abundant than the LH IIIA material. Sherds from Mitrou dating to the LH IIIB1 period are</page><page sequence="47">THE BRONZE AGE SITE OF MITROU 209 still numerous. They belong to (ring-based) kraters, deep bowls, stirrup jars, and especially kylikes. Diagnostic for this period is the Zygouries kylix, with unpainted rim and one large motif in the center of each side. Only a stem belonging to a Zygouries kylix has been identified in the Mitrou material (D86). LH IIIB1 first saw the introduction of the vertical version of the whorl shell as a decoration,85 present on many sherds in the catalogue. D72, a sturdy body sherd belonging to a krater, has a decoration of a vertical whorl shell and an octopus flower, types common in LH IIIBl.86The filled body of the whorl shell dates this sherd to the end of the LH IIIB1 period.87 The horizontal voluted flowers of D75 are diagnostic for LH IIIB1.88 The LH IIIB2 period in Greece is characterized by the appearance of deep bowls with a monochrome painted interior and a very deep rim band and rosette bowls. Neither has been identified in the Mitrou surface material, and in fact only D87 and D88 have been assigned with certainty to LH IIIB2. Two transport stirrup jars, D93 and D94, are crudely made. D93 is fired very hard (Mohs 7), but D94 has the same medium hard fabric as most fine wares (Mohs 3). Since D93 is also unusual with its shell inclu- sions (the only other catalogued piece with shell inclusions is C15), it may be an import.

As Mountjoy (1986, p. 67) explains, the vertical whorl shell ap- pears before the deep bowl, so that one can adopt an earlier boundary based on the appearance of the vertical whorl shell, or a later one based on the ap- pearance of the deep bowl. Here we have chosen to assign all vertical whorl shells to LH IIIB1 rather than to LH IIIA2 (and thus adopt the earlier marker), since they became popular in IIIB only. 86. Cf.

It comes mainly from LH IIIC Middle kraters, some of which show elaborate nonpictorial designs. Other shapes are deep bowls; not catalogued here but recognized among the other inventoried material are amphoras and (stirrup) jars.89 The design for D96 and D97 has a close parallel with a krater from Dimini that displays characteristics of the LH IIIC Middle period as well as the PG period.90 D95, a deep bowl with monochrome interior and deep rim band on the exterior, is characterized by simple linear decoration and continues a shape from the LH IIIB period although it dates to the LH IIIC Early period. A number of krater fragments, D96-D98, date to LH IIIC Middle. 89. For a description and catalogue of all inventoried LH IIIC material, see Kramer-Hajos 2005, pp. 216-220, 333-337. 90.

Only the large krater fragment D98 seems to have been unsuccessful: the rim is very crooked as a result of the handle attachment. In most cases the clay is hard and well levigated. Fabrics are generally darker than in preceding periods, a brownish or pinkish buff, with dark brown paint or reddish paint on a light slip. Occasionally the dark paint is highly vitrified, as on D96. Somewhat similar to the design on D101 is the decoration on a vessel from Scimatari, although that is much more sloppily executed.91 Late Helladic IIIC Early D95 Bowl (C2-606.17) RL. 0.046, p.W. 0.053, Diam. ca. 0.140, Th. 0.002-0.004 m.

Late Helladic Small Finds The Late Helladic group of small finds comprises two lead fishing weights, five steatite spindle whorls, three steatite beads or counters, two terracotta spindle whorls, a terracotta bead, and fragments of five anthropomorphic, nine zoomorphic, and two chariot-group figurines, as well as a fragment of a large zoomorphic figure. Metal Evidence of fishing at Mitrou is provided by two folded lead fishing weights. D104 is almost square, while D105 is thin and elongated. Both types offish- ing weights are very similar to those from a fisherman's tomb in Perati, Attica (LH IIIC-12th century B.C.).92 Their dimensions are very similar, although the weights of the Perati examples are not given. Iakovidis records that local fishermen suggested that the weights were from a manomenon, a trammel net, consisting of three parallel net walls joined to the same lines with the middle wall having a much finer mesh,93 but Powell says such weights could be used either in a trammel net or in a cast net.94 The weights from Mitrou weigh 24 g (D104) and 14 g (D105), respectively. Powell reports that the weights currently in use are about 25 g for ipezovolo (circular cast net), and between 34 and 45 g for apladia (single-walled net set in a loca- tion and later retrieved) and manomena.95 Folded lead weights are exclusive to the LBA when metallurgy in gen- eral, and the use of lead specifically, became more common and accessible to ordinary people.96 The advantage of lead weights is that they are less bulky than stone or terracotta ones and can perform the same task as stone weights with only a fifth of the number of weights.97 As they are more expensive, however, they may have been used only in offshore fishing away from rocky areas. Lead would probably have been imported from Laurion in Attica or Siphnos. "Square" folded weights of similar dimensions have also been found in a LH IIIA/B grave on the island of Astypalaia.98 Reference has already been made to the analysis of the Mycenaean skeletons from the nearby AyiaTriada tombs believed to be associated with Mitrou. This analysis revealed that one of the factors contributing to the greater age at death of the interred in relation to other Lokrian sites was better nutrition, and fish was an important part of that enhanced diet.99 D104 Lead fishing weight (M-F3.x01) Fig. 39 P.L. 0.023, p.W. 0.019, Th. 0.009 m; Wt. 0.024 kg.

Rectangle of lead folded over on itself to form an elongated rectangle. Stone The stone spindle whorls, counters, and beads make an interesting col- lection of eight pieces: four of black steatite, four of green. An unworked example of macroscopically identical green steatite material from Proskynas is on display in the Atalanti museum. This material is not available locally and may have been imported from as far away as Kythera or Crete. There are five straight-sided, truncated, flat-topped cones, or at least they appear as such in their preserved condition. Very similar stone spindle whorls were recovered at another Lokrian site, Megaplatanos.100 The function of these so-called spindle whorls has long been a matter of dispute. Whether they are dress weights, true spindle whorls, buttons, or ornaments is still a matter of debate.101 Their presence on the chest of a corpse in a grave at Megaplatanos lends credence to their identification as ornaments of some kind.102 Two of the Mitrou spindle whorls (one conical, Dill, and one cylindrical, D112) do not have piercings, so they may have been counters or gaming pieces, or unfinished beads. There is one biconical bead of smooth black steatite (D113) but the cones are asymmetrical. D106 Spindle whorl (M-H4.xO2) Fig. 40 PH. 0.032, p.Diam. 0.041, p.Diam. hole 0.007 m; Wt. 0.066 kg.

Terracotta Two LH terracotta spindle whorls and one bead were found. D114, though biconical, is of significantly different form from the steatite MH biconical whorls described above: in this case, one cone is little more than a convex surface and there is no incised decoration, and the other cone has slightly concave sides. D115, although incomplete, is the largest and heaviest of the terracotta whorls recovered from Mitrou. Carington Smith notes that heavier whorls became common after the Neolithic period, and that this change may reflect a switch from wool to flax spinning, which requires a heavier whorl.103 D116 is probably too small and light to have been a spindle whorl. Carington Smith observes that a very light whorl can keep a spindle spinning if its diameter is wide enough to compensate for the lack of weight. She reports that experiments suggest that whorl diameters should fall between 2 and 8 cm, and optimally between 3 and 7 cm. Their weight can range between 5 and 90 g, but they function best if they weigh between 10 and 50 g. Furthermore, Carington Smith doubts that a whorl with a hole diameter of less than 4 mm could accommodate the tip of a spindle.104 Thus, D116 is marginal on weight, fails to meet minimum diameter needs, and has too small a perforation to be an effective or even functioning spindle whorl. It is notable, too, that its asym- metrical biconical shape recalls that of the black steatite bead D113. 103. Carington Smith 2000, p. 217. 104.

Five of these are anthropomorphic. The one Phi head and torso (D117) has applied eyes, solid painting of the top and back of the head, and numer- ous wavy lines decorating the body that mark this figurine as a Phi A in French's classification system and date it to LH IIIA2-early IIIB.105 D118 is a stem, probably from a Phi B or Psi basic figurine (LH IIIA-B). The head with polos (D119) has a cross painted on the top of the polos with a dot in each quadrant; the cross decoration recalls LH IIIB examples from Mycenae cited by French.106 There are two Psi torso fragments. D120 has no breasts. The torso of D121 with applied pellet breasts, a heavy edge-line to the upper body, and an elaborate red painted decoration on the back identify it as a late Psi A type and date it to late LH IIIB.107 There are no identifiable Tau figurine fragments. It is hard to determine the species represented by the nine Mycenaean zoomorphic figurines in the Mitrou assemblage, but most are probably bovid. We follow French's classification system, which distinguishes animal figurines by decoration: Wavy, Linear, Spine, and Ladder.108 There are no identifiable examples of the Spine or Ladder types. There is one example of the earliest and most naturalistic type of zoomorphic figurine: D122 is Wavy type 1 (LH IIIA), with irregular wavy lines swirling around the horns, legs, body, and head. The more schematic, parallel wavy lines on the body of D123 marks it as an example of Wavy type 2 (LH IIIA-B). The multiple straight lines running the length of the body of D124 identify it as Linear type 1 (LH IIIA-B). There are two identifiable examples of Linear type 2 animal figurines that span LH IIIA-B. D125 does not have the common neckband, and an unusual feature is the broad band that runs down the throat and along the belly. D126 is a more typical example of Linear type 2, with three parallel lines extending down the back from a neckband. The surface of D127 is so battered that no surface decoration is discernible. The remaining zoomorphic fragments are D128, a leg, and D129 and D130 that could be either legs or horns. Two fragments of chariot groups were recovered from Mitrou. In typical LBA chariot groups, the horses are modeled either in the round or as flat- tened strips.109 Often the legs of each horse are represented schematically with just one "leg" to represent the forequarters or hindquarters of each animal. The bodies of the horses are then joined at the rear by the chariot, 105. French 1971, p. 116. 106. French 1971, p. 146. 107. French 1971, pp. 133-134. 108.

D131, however, has the bodies of the two horses formed from one piece of clay; the heads, forelegs, and rear of the horses along with the actual chariot are broken off. D132 must have belonged to a more typical chariot group, with each horse separately modeled in the round; only the hindquarters and tail of one of the horses was recovered. With only one "leg" to represent the hindquarters, it cannot have stood alone. The final item in this section (D133) is a fragment not of a figurine but of a large figure. While it is possible that the bovid ear may come from a rhyton, it seems more likely to be part of a large bull figure. Large bull figures, or portions thereof, have been found at Phylakopi, the Citadel House area of Mycenae, Amyklaion, and, most recently, the Mycenaean settlement of Dimini.110 French observes that large or wheelmade animal figures have generally been associated with a votive deposit. The terracotta hoof of a bovine figure that must have been at least 50 cm tall was found in the Mycenaean levels of the peak sanctuary on the summit of Kynortion in Epidauria.111 More recently, excavations at the Mycenaean settlement of Dimini recovered a large terracotta bull figure in what appears to be a household shrine.112 D117 Head and torso; Phi A (C2-609.x01) Fig. 41 P.H. 0.056, p.W. 0.029, Th. 0.019 m; Wt. 0.013 kg.

The representative sample presented below includes the leg of a marble vessel, fragments of two stone bowls (probably mortars), fragments of two saddle querns, six pounding stones, one stone pestle, a whetstone, and 55 pieces of chipped stone. Ground Stone Three fragments of stone vessels have not been dated to a particular phase of the Bronze Age. El appears to be a polypod vase leg of white marble. The others appear to have the form of three-legged bowls. They recall the form of the Mycenaean tripod mortar, described by Runnels as having "a deep, bowl- shaped body, three short, rectangular legs, and a spout at the rim."113 This type is common in Cyprus, Crete, the Cyclades, and on the mainland in the Middle and Late Bronze Age, and is found in both do- mestic and ritual contexts. Runnels suggests that it may have been used for grinding spices, like those employed in scenting olive oil. The two examples recovered in the southern Argolid survey are made of Saronic Gulf-type andesite, and Runnels suggests that there may have been a production site for such mortars on one of the islands there. Each of the two possible mortars from Mitrou preserves a leg and part of an open, rounded basin but neither confirms the presence of a spout. The smooth interior on E2 indicates that it may have been used as a mortar, but its material and shape recall a three-legged stone vessel in the Nauplion archaeological museum identified as a washbasin. Furthermore, the interior surface is uniformly smooth, and there is no evidence of greater wear at the bottom of the bowl. E3 seems like a closer match for the Mycenaean tripod mortar because the leg has a rectangular cross-section; the interior of the bowl, however, is as rough as the exterior, so it may not have been used much.

Both are later- ally flat but longitudinally concave from regular use. None of the saddle querns we encountered preserves its full length but many preserve the entire width. The widths of E4 (0.18 m) and E5 (0.15 m) fall within the typical range for Bronze Age querns recovered by the southern Argolid survey project, and from excavated Bronze Age sites in the Argolid.115 As there is no discernible change throughout the Bronze Age in size, form, or material of saddle querns,116 no close dating is possible for E4 or E5.

Chipped Stone Throughout the Bronze Age, a largely continuous tradition of lithic tech- nology existed, so there are very few means to distinguish between the technology and typology of the EH, MH, and LH periods.122 All of the chipped stone pieces from Mitrou have been assigned to the general Bronze Age group because, without any stratigraphic reference, it would be specu- lative to distribute them among the different phases of the Bronze Age, and arbitrary to assign them to a particular phase. Only two or three pieces from the assemblage might possibly be assigned to a particular period. The presence of cores and chipped stone on the surface of Mitrou, where there is comparatively little material earlier than LH pottery, suggests that the chipped stone industry continued throughout the Bronze Age and, perhaps, into the Early Iron Age. Given restrictions of space, we provide catalogue entries below for a representative sample of the lithics collected, including two sickle elements (E62, E63) that are quite probably of MH type. Since excavation of Mitrou has now begun, it should be possible eventually to compare this assemblage with artifacts from dated and stratified contexts. Not all pieces of chipped stone recovered during the grab sample phase of the survey were kept. Only pieces deemed to be diagnostic (pieces recognized in the field as cores, tools, etc.) were retained. Thus, less distinctive artifacts, such as smaller blade or flake fragments, or some cortical pieces, were never recorded as part of the assemblage. For that reason, tables showing percentages of material in the collection would not be a reliable indicator of preference or availability and would probably mischaracterize the assemblage. We have therefore eschewed such an approach and included only our own necessarily subjec- tive selection, based on what we deemed representative of the range and quality of the Mitrou chipped stone assemblage. Materials. Obsidian at Mitrou is glossy black to striated gray black. Like the obsidian at Lerna, Lithares, Manika, Pefkakia, andTsoungiza, it is visually consistent with obsidian from Melos, but no provenance studies have been performed.123 Of the 55 chipped stone pieces in the sample, 41 are obsidian, and only 14 are chert. The chert varies widely in texture and color, from chocolate to gray to green. In this regard, the Mitrou chert assemblage more closely reflects the variety found at Lerna, Lithares, and Tsoungiza. At Manika, by contrast, a green chert is the only chipped stone material other than obsidian.124 Two chert flakes, E41 and E42, exhibit the visual characteristics of the chocolate chert from the Pindus region, popular at Pefkakia.125 There are several pieces of chert dappled with brown and green. Unworked pieces of macroscopically identical chert can be found near the village of Kyparissi, just a few kilometers from Mitrou. No local source was positively identi- fied for any of the other chert recovered during the East Lokris survey. Almost all the chert beds identified during the survey or in subsequent years in the hills east of Mitrou are of such poor quality that they could not be worked. The value of chipped stone provenance studies to under- standing interregional and local economic consumption has been amply demonstrated by Blitzer, Kardulias, Parkinson, and Newhard.126 It is hoped</page><page sequence="66">228 MARGARETHA KRAMER-HAJOS AND KERILL O'NEILL that provenance studies on all the chipped stone can be accomplished in the course of the excavations. The reduction sequence. The presence of cortical flakes (primary, sec- ondary, and tertiary) in the obsidian assemblage indicates that unprepared nodules were imported to Mitrou, and the entire range of the obsidian reduction sequence took place locally (Fig. 46).127 Of course, the presence of cortical material does not preclude the possibility that decorticated cores were also imported. The evidence from the Lakonia survey indicates that only roughly prepared nodules were imported from Melos.128 At Tsoun- giza, too, the virtual absence of cortical flakes from an otherwise complete chatne operatoire indicates that cores were at least partially prepared before importation.129 Mitrou, however, follows the pattern of other Bronze Age sites in central Greece (Manika, Pefkakia, and Lithares) where decortica- tion took place on site. In the chert assemblage, cortex is found on one retouched flake (E42), two flake core fragments (E16, E17), and one sickle element (E62). There are no unretouched chert cortical flakes, which may indicate that only fin- ished chert tools or prepared cores were imported to Mitrou. The evidence from the southern Argolid, Messenia, and other sites in central Greece suggests that some finished chert products were imported while others were fashioned locally.130 Since the overall number of chert pieces in this Mitrou assemblage is low, however, we must be cautious about drawing firm conclusions. Complete examples and fragments of cores indicate that several dif- ferent methods were employed in the reduction sequence. There are seven blade cores, four flake cores, and one core (E22) that was initially reduced for blades but, after a failed attempt at core rejuvenation, was reduced for flakes. The presence of both blade and flake industries at Mitrou contrasts with monolithic blade production at Lithares andTsoungiza, where flakes occurred only as by-products of blade-making, but parallels the twin in- dustries found at Pefkakia.131 The blade industry is often accompanied by a flake industry at sites in Messenia. It may be that some centers deliberately fashioned flakes too, because their production demands less skill.132 The Mitrou blade cores come in tabular, conical, and miniature ver- sions. While some scholars have attributed conical cores to the Neolithic and tabular to the Bronze Age, it is more likely that the distinction indi- cates different methods of blade production or, perhaps, different stages in the reduction sequence, with tabular cores eventually becoming conical as reduction progresses.133 The complete miniblade core (E23) measures only 0.014 m in length. There are four complete conical blade cores, and they range in length from 0.053 to 0.064 m. The mean length is 0.057 m. The only tabular core (E18) is somewhat smaller, with a length of 0.029 m. The predominance of conical cores at Mitrou stands in marked contrast to the all but exclusive use of tabular cores at Lerna and Tsoungiza, and a heavy preference for tabular cores at Lithares and Manika.134 Faceted platforms are an integral element of core preparation for all the blade cores: conical, tabular, and miniature. Some of the cores (obsidian and chert) have a crest in situ creating a corner. Mitrou, like other Bronze Age sites, employed pressure-flaking tech- niques in stone tool production rather than direct or indirect percussion. 127. Primary flakes have 70% or more of their dorsal surface covered by cortex; secondary, from 30% to 70% covered; tertiary, less than 30% covered. 128. Carter and Ydo 1996, p. 160. 129.

It nonetheless is paralleled by a piece from Manika, where Karabatsoli notes the re-exploitation of a blade core to provide flakes created by indirect percussion.135 Some cores show evidence of splintering, or use as tools. E15, a flake core, has a faceted scraping edge showing signs of use-wear, and E22 has been subject to splintering, which suggests use as a tool. Rejuvenation of blade cores as flake cores, and their subsequent reuse as pieces esquillees maybe a feature of the chipped stone industries of central Greece. Karabatsoli observes examples from Manika, Pefkakia, andTsoun- giza.136Two of the flake cores, E16 and E17, and two of the blade cores, E21 and E2S, are chert. The chert cores exhibit a degree of fine workmanship matching that of the obsidian cores. E21, made from the dappled brown and green chert we associate with Kyparissi, is a particularly fine example of a Bronze Age core. It is conical, with a carefully faceted platform, and parallel blade scars extending up to zposterieur crest in situ. The assemblage offers examples of primary, secondary, and tertiary crested blades. There are three primary crested blades, and all three have been retouched. One (E32) exhibits possible signs of use-wear. Two second- ary crested blades (E33, E34) are catalogued below, and both are anterior crested blades. That is to say, they are part of the reduction sequence moving away from the removal of the first crest, before meeting the second, and therefore later (posterieur) crest. One of the secondary crested blades (E34) is truncated with a notch on the right margin. All three tertiary crested blades have been retouched. E35 has bifacial and bimarginal retouch. E36 has a notch on its right margin. One tertiary crested blade (E67) is the blank for * piece esquillee (the term "blank" encompasses blades and flakes). The 13 blade fragments have a mean width of 0.009 m, and all examples fall within the range of 0.006 and 0.015 m. The mean blade thickness is 0.0026 m and there is little variation, with all blades having a thickness of no more than 0.003 and no less than 0.002 m. The only complete blade recovered by the survey is E33, a secondary crested blade that measures 0.05 m in length. The six proximal blade fragments have triangular butts, and there is no sign of trimming to remove overhang on any of them. Flakes were produced in the process of core preparation and as a delib- erate product of the reduction sequence. The catalogue contains examples of chert and obsidian flakes, both unmodified and retouched as blanks for a variety of tools. Tools. Tools at Mitrou are formed on blades and flakes, obsidian and chert. A common tool type is the retouched piece. A retouched piece is a blank (i.e., blade or flake) that has been deliberately retouched but does not fit into a recognized morphological or functional category. Retouch varies from continuous to discontinuous, and occurs on one or both margins, and on one or both surfaces. Retouched blades are found at Bronze Age sites, but their presence in greater numbers is associated more with the later Neolithic.137 Of numerous examples, just one retouched blade and two retouched flakes are included in this catalogue. Surprisingly, at the Euboian site of Manika, there is a marked paucity of retouched pieces.138 One retouched flake at Mitrou (E45) is truncated at the distal end and 135.

It also has been thinned on the dorsal surface to create a comfortable thumb grip. Notched pieces may have blades or flakes as their blanks, and there are two examples from each type of blank in the catalogue below. On the two blades, E46 and E47, notches are created by tiny retouch on the dorsal surface. E47 is a secondary cortical blade, with cortex present on the distal end. The notched flakes have been subjected to more continuous retouch. E48 has a notch on each margin, one near the proximal end, one near the distal. E49 also has two notches but they are both on the distal end. Some additional retouch on the dorsal surface may indicate overhang removal. There are two pointed pieces, E50 and E51. Tools of this type, also called piercers otpergoirsy can be formed on flakes or blades and are usually found on the distal end of the blank. They may have served to pierce holes in hides or shells, to incise pottery, or generally to scrape, bore, drill, or score a variety of materials.139 Both of these examples were formed on flakes. Multiple tools, that is, tools with two or more retouched areas designed for different functions, may indicate conservative use of source material. On the other hand, Kardulias and Runnels suggest that the increase in popu- larity of multiple tools in the Bronze Age Argolid should be linked with the Helladic peoples' "wider range of tool-using behavior." They theorize that multiple tools may indirectly contribute to the impression of aa more complex scheme for exploiting the environment. "140 The Mitrou assemblage offers six examples of multiple tools. One piece, E52, has the potential to function as a pointed piece, a notched piece, and a side-scraper. ES3 presents two notches on its left margin, and it is truncated on its distal end. Between the truncation and the second notch, there is a point that shows signs of rounding and crushing. E54 is truncated, too, but at the proximal end, and it has a single notch, created by dorsal retouch on its right margin. ES5 combines an end-scraper with a notched piece. It has another interesting feature: on the dorsal surface, over the notch, a large thinning flake has been detached to create a better thumb grip for using the tool as an end-scraper. E56, which combines a side-scraper with a pointed piece, has also had a thinning flake removed from the dorsal surface to facilitate a more secure thumb grip.141 E57 is a side-scraper that has been truncated on its distal end. Four of the six multiple tools offer the possibilities of a scraper of some sort. Three of them are side-scrapers, just one is an end-scraper. In addition to these multiple tool scrapers, there are also two plain side-scrapers, ES8 and E59. E58 is formed on a primary cortical flake, a part of the chaine operatoire that is often passed over at other sites as a blank for tool manufacture. One of the few functional tool types that can be identified by macro- scopic analysis alone, a sickle element is characterized not only by a den- ticulated margin or margins but also by the presence of silica gloss. Silica gloss is a polish produced by abrasion of the tool edge with soil particles or plant stems.142 One of the few morphological traits that maybe chronologi- cally diagnostic is whether sickle elements were made on a blade (EH II) or a flake (EH III/MH).143 Of the four sickle elements in this catalogue, only one, E60, was made on a chert blade. E61, E62, and E63 were all made on chert flakes. There are also two denticulated sickle elements of characteristic Middle Helladic type, E62 and E63.144 139.

A better grip is made possible by a similar thinning flake on the dorsal surface of E45, a retouched flake. 142.

The removal of the proximal or distal end might facilitate the hafting of the blade in a piece of wood or horn.145 One truncated blade (E64) is devoid of retouch while the other (E6S) has limited retouch on both margins near the distal truncation. Pieces esquillees are heavily splintered pieces that exhibit flaking scars from battering at opposite ends. Their function remains uncertain but they may have served either as tinder flints or as tools to shape antler or bone.146 There are three pieces esquillees in the Mitrou catalogue below. One of these (E68) appears to have been formed on a tertiary crested blade. At Manika, pieces esquillees are the predominant tool type, while at Lithares they are very rare.147 In general, splintering is common at Mitrou, and, in addition to these pieces esquillees, there are many other pieces in the assemblage that show evidence of splintering. Chipped Stone: Some Conclusions The presence of unretouched primary cortical flakes demonstrates that unprepared nodules of obsidian were imported to Mitrou and decortication took place on site. This contrasts with evidence from Tsoungiza and from the Lakonia survey that indicates that only roughly prepared nodules were imported from Melos.Torrence has suggested that there were two different procurement strategies for Melian obsidian: (1) "special-purpose" trips by experienced knappers who carefully selected nodules and performed the preliminary decortication and preparation of cores at the quarries before transporting them elsewhere; and (2) haphazard collection and transporta- tion of unworked nodules by traders, fishermen, or other people as a task of secondary importance to their primary goal or occupation.148 The people of Mitrou, it seems, obtained their raw materials from Melos by the latter, more opportunistic method. Kardulias and Runnels observe that the increasingly complex polities of the Bronze Age create a potential for more regular, structured exchange of raw materials. They identify crested blades as indicators of on-site modifica- tion of nodules into blade cores, as opposed to the importation of prepared cores. They then cite an abundance of crested blades at a particular site (in comparison with others in a region) as a marker that that particular site may be "a major obsidian processing center which, if it did not control, certainly had a major input into, the exchange network involving obsidian, and probably other commodities as well."149 The sample of crested blades from Mitrou permits us to speculate that the site may prove to be just such a major obsidian processing center. It will be interesting in future years to compare and contrast the Mitrou chipped stone assemblage with those of Proskynas, Kynos, and other Bronze Age sites in Lokris, and more broadly with those of Lithares, Manika, and Pefkakia, to see if these sites obtained finished products from Mitrou.150 Mitrou was inhabited throughout the Bronze Age, and we know from Lerna, for example, that there were changes in the chipped stone industry from period to period in terms of preference and procurement of raw ma- terials, and in terms of economic activity. Thus, we must practice caution in drawing conclusions from the relative presence or absence of certain materials or economic indicators in a survey assemblage. For example, obsidian predominates over chert at Mitrou, as at most Bronze Age sites, 145. Carter and Ydo 1996, pp. 146- 147. 146. Runnels 1985, p. 374. 147. Karabatsoli 1997, pp. 188, 218. 148.

Four of the 12 cores from Mitrou are chert but chert products of the reduction sequence make up a much smaller percentage of the assemblage. Does this mean that Mitrou was a distribution center for imported chert cores? In the Argolid, probably because of widespread access to low-quality cherts throughout the region, there is no evidence for a single major chert-artifact production or distribution center,151 but that does not preclude such a scenario in Lokris. Carter and Ydo suggest that cores may have been curated resources, and that their presence in larger numbers may indicate that a site is a regional center.152 Despite the possible evidence that Mitrou was a center for the manu- facture and distribution of obsidian and chert artifacts, there are also signs that obsidian was used conservatively. Kardulias and Runnels note that some sites appear to view cortical flakes as waste, preferring to use small noncortical flakes as blanks for retouching rather than the larger cortical flakes. At Mitrou, however, several cortical pieces have been retouched to form tools, and crested blades have also been retouched or used. In addi- tion, three out of the four sickle elements were used on both sides. There are also several multiple tools, and they may constitute another sign of conservative use of raw material. Since excavations on Mitrou have now started, it should be possible to interpret these features of the assemblage at some future date.153 E14 Core, flake (M-H4.x01a) Fig. 46 P.L. 0.043, p.W. 0.054, Th. 0.025 m.

Protogeometric Pottery The Protogeometric material from Mitrou is less abundant than that of earlier periods, though still indicative of settlement. Shapes and decoration are drastically different from those of preceding periods and have parallels with material from Lefkandi and Kalapodi. Sherds belong to a small range of shapes among which are kraters and skyphoi with pendant concentric semicircles, a hallmark of the period.154 A cup fragment with zigzag decora- tion (F4) follows the Attic preference for having one zigzag line, whereas examples from Lefkandi exhibit a preference for a double zigzag.155 We do find a double zigzag, however, on the amphora rim Fl. High conical feet such as F5-F7 are attested for a range of open shapes: cups, skyphoi, bowls, and krater bowls.156 The partial (banded) decoration on F7 executed in dull orange paint may place it in the Submycenaean rather than the PG period, though this is tentative; it has a parallel with a cup from Lefkandi.157 The skyphos fragments F8, F9, and F10 seem to belong to the basic shape with a "deep rounded body and out-curved lip"158 and have a mono- chrome painted rim. Fll has at least two sets of concentric semicircles, spaced so close together that they just overlap. The center of the semicircles is taken up by a Maltese cross or hourglass, common in the Lefkandi material on both kraters and krater bowls;159 the Mitrou example differs slightly in its much larger number of semicircles (13, as compared to the 154.

F10 and Fll are fragments from large well-built kraters. A few coarse fragments from pithoi have been selected to represent a group of LH III-EPG coarse ware common on Mitrou (F16-F19). These fragments are decorated with rows of small impressed squares possibly made with a comblike instrument;164 they have parallels with large coarse hand- built pithoi from Kalapodi and with a fragment of a Mycenaean relief pithos from Delphi.165 The Kalapodi examples date from LH IIIC to EPG, and they become more and more popular toward the end of this time span.166 One coarse pithos fragment (F19) has a decoration of impressed rings.167 These, too, are attested for Kalapodi and are also known from a Geometric tomb inTragana.168 Linear decoration or bands of fingerprints are attested at both Mitrou and Kalapodi as well, but the elsewhere popular rows of indented small grooves ("Kerbbandleisten"), present at Kalapodi, are conspicuously absent at Mitrou.169 After the Protogeometric period, the sherd quantity decreases dramati- cally, indicating that the site was essentially uninhabited from then on.

The superior quality of the preserved Late Bronze Age fragments indicates the presence of a Mycenaean elite, with many sherds coming from high-class wares. Mitrou seems to have reached its acme in importance and richness during the Mycenaean period. Although evidence for an EH I phase is lacking, settlement was unin- terrupted from the EH II period through the ProtogeometricThe EH wares display some characteristics that are shared with the extremely similar mate- rial from nearby Proskynas. The coarse sauceboats and the highly burnished bowl and saucer fragments in a warm orange fabric are especially typical for both sites. It is tempting to suppose that Proskynas, where evidence for an industrial potters' quarter was found,170 may have been the production site for some of the EH Mitrou material. Much of the EH II material is similar to that found at other EH central Greek sites such as Eutresis, Lithares, and Manika, which places Mitrou firmly in the general EH cultural tradition of the area. The presence of the depas (B30) suggests contact with the eastern Aegean, and the large amounts of obsidian, some of which must date to the EH period, indicate contact with Melos via the Euboian Gulf. In the MH period both Gray Minyan and Matt-Painted wares have parallels with Pteleon to the northwest. Gray Minyan handle fragments, in particular, resemble the material from Pteleon illustrated by Maran.171 Red-Burnished ware is reminiscent of similar ware from Eutresis in Boiotia, although some of it was manufactured on Aigina. This situation indicates that trade, in part or possibly entirely over sea, continued in the Middle Bronze Age. Contact with Pteleon, too, may have occurred via the Euboian Gulf, which is a shorter route than overland. The MH material shows markedly less sea-erosion damage than the EH material. Many fragments are well preserved, possibly because they come from cist tombs. The MH small finds of particular interest are the bronze ax (C35) and the stone chisel mold (C36). If the ax was not fash- ioned at Mitrou, at the very least it demonstrates the existence of trade with the eastern Mediterranean. The presence of the mold, however, indicates that metallurgical processes were undertaken at Mitrou. The abundance of LH material shows that Mitrou was extensively settled throughout the Mycenaean era. In the LH I phase, Middle Helladic pottery traditions persisted beside the new Mycenaean shapes and schemes of decoration, and sometimes mixed with them, as is especially clear in the Gray Minyan cup (Dl). Gray Minyan ware had a strong tradition in central Greece and it is not surprising that it persisted even when Myce- naean shapes became predominant. If Polychrome Matt-Painted ware has a Boiotian origin, as Dietz suggests,172 the many sherds of this ware from Mitrou show that during this transition from MH to purely Mycenaean pottery, the traditions from central Greece remain strong. The presence of lustrous LH I ware at Mitrou shows that this style, and thus possibly the Mycenaean culture associated with it, arrived and was 170. E. Zahou (pers. comm.). 171.

Whether the style was introduced to Mitrou by "the actual movements of potters familiar with the style,"173 or by the import of examples from another center,174 it proves that Mitrou had con- nections with the mainstream of Mycenaean culture from its inception. It also indicates that Mitrou was an important center - important enough to attract potters from other centers or to import the latest fashion items - and at this time had closer connections with the southern part of Greece than with its northern part, given the virtual absence of LH I material to the north of Mitrou. The presence of Aiginetan ware throughout the Myce- naean era confirms (trade) contacts with the Aegean. The LH II sherd material from Mitrou is remarkable for its quality, with decorative schemes suggesting contact with Crete. The LH IIIA-B material is equally well made and follows fully the shapes and decorations common to the period. Comparison of the LH IIIC pottery from Mitrou with that of Kynos and Elateia reveals similarities between the Kynos and Mitrou material. The Elateia LH IIIC pottery is paler in color and less crisply painted with a duller paint. The strong parallel of the unusual LH IIIC Middle krater fragments D96 and D97 with a krater from Dimini suggests that Mitrou in the LH IIIC phase formed a koine with other sites on the coast of or near the Euboian Gulf. Maritime traffic through the Euboian Gulf united the sites of Mitrou, Kynos, Dimini, and others; the interior possibly did not partake in this exchange of goods and ideas and followed a different tradition at a time when the Mycenaean palatial networks were no longer functional, as suggested by the differences between the material from Mitrou and that from Elateia. The quantities of sherds at Mitrou dimin- ish somewhat in LH IIIC, and it is possible that in this period the site of Kynos to the north played the main role in the area. The LH IIIC material from Kynos is rich and includes figurative krater fragments.175 The 50 inventoried Protogeometric sherds from Mitrou indicate that occupation continued into the Early Iron Age. After this time period there was almost no human activity.176 The continuity from Bronze to Iron Age corresponds with patterns at Lefkandi, Kalapodi, and Elateia. Pithos fragments from Mitrou show marked similarities with LH IIIC- PG material from Kalapodi, and skyphoi with pendant concentric semi- circles indicate contact with Euboia. A skyphos with pendant semicircles from the Geometric cemetery in Tragana, found in an extraordinarily rich grave that also yielded, among other objects, a bronze phiale with a neo- Hittite inscription,177 is dated to the Middle to Late Geometric transition on the basis of its shape: its low profile and offset lip are typical for later skyphoi.178 The fragments from Mitrou fall into an earlier category with a taller profile and a less offset lip, and predate the finds at Tragana. It is thus difficult to establish a connection between the Tragana cemetery and Mitrou in the Early Iron Age on the basis of the Mitrou surface material. Possibly the locus of settlement shifted in the Geometric period from Mitrou to Tragana, although no evidence for a Geometric settlement in or near Tragana exists to date. A variety of materials were imported to Mitrou: obsidian, chert, an- desite, steatite, marble, lead, and copper. The presence of these materials 173. Dickinson 1994, p. 129. 174. Provenance studies of the clay used for some of Mitrou's vessels would be useful in determining the extent of import. 175.

Even when one supposes that erosion will have destroyed the later material, one would expect to find quantities of it on the shores, washed down from above. There is, however, hardly any of it anywhere around the island, with the exception of Roman combed ware sherds, which occasion- ally turn up on the southwestern and, more rarely, the southeastern shore. These sherds may be connected with underwater walls on the west side of Mitrou; see above, p. 168 and Fig. 5. 177. Onassoglou 1989, p. 21. 178. Onassoglou 1989, p. 38; cf.

We have no evidence for the local working of some of these materials (andesite, marble, lead, or steatite), and they may have arrived at Mitrou as finished objects. Andesite from the Saronic Gulf was used for saddle querns, and andesite from Nisyros and Santorini in the south Aegean volcanic arc was used for both a tripod mortar and saddle querns. No provenance studies have been undertaken for the lead weights recov- ered at Mitrou, but the lead is likely to have come from as far afield as the Laurion mines in Attica or those at Ayios Sostis on Siphnos. The steatite used to fashion beads, counters, and spindle whorls probably originated on Kythera or Crete. Copper metallurgy took place at Mitrou but the nearest copper sources are in Thessaly, Attica, and southeastern Euboia. Obsidian nodules were imported, presumably from Melos, in unworked form, and the full reduction sequence took place on site. For chert, too, it seems likely that at least some working of imported material occurred locally. The composition of the chipped stone assemblage suggests that Mitrou may have been a significant regional distribution center for both obsidian and chert. Primary, secondary, and tertiary cortical flakes indicate that obsidian nodules were imported in an unworked state. The presence of crested blades demonstrates that cores were then prepared at Mitrou. Finally, if chipped stone cores really do constitute curated resources, the number of obsidian and chert cores recovered by the survey encourages us to investigate in future years whether Mitrou may have been an important processing center for chipped stone, possibly even exerting control over the commodity within the region. Thus, analysis of the pottery and small finds recovered from Mitrou, coupled with the results of the geophysical survey, present a picture of a settlement that profited from its location to endure throughout the Bronze Age and into the Early Iron Age. The inhabitants engaged in trade over a wide area of the Aegean. Possibly as early as its inception in the Early Hel- ladic period, Mitrou was an important regional center for the processing of chipped stone tools, importing obsidian from Melos and chert from other sources. By the Middle Helladic period, Mitrou was prosperous enough to engage in metallurgy, fashioning bronze tools from imported materials. It reached its apex in the Mycenaean period when it was home to a wealthy elite group who thrived on a diet supplemented by the fish they caught, and lived to a ripe old age by contemporary standards. The later settlement appears to have had an orderly city grid, and may have been divided into different quarters for the rich and ordinary citizenry. Now that an ongoing excavation of Mitrou has begun, it should be possible in the future to test, confirm, or refute the deductions we have offered here on the basis of the nonintrusive methods of geophysical and surface survey.</page><page sequence="85">THE BRONZE AGE SITE OF MITROU 247 REFERENCES Banks, E.
