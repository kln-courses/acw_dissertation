Those words, if simply quoted at third hand as coming from such a source, might be taken as damnatory; but they were meant for praise. At any rate, this sort of remark sets one to think- ing about that quality in the inanimate work of art which may broadly be called physical, particularly in still-life painting and in sculpture in the round, which (even more than still life) minimizes connotation and narrative, and deals with the observable fact. Such thoughts recur at sight of the sculpture of Richmond Barthe, who has ap- parently arrived at a difficult point. He has always been wonderfully right about the choice of that important thing called the "significant moment of rest"; but the choice of the degree of illusion is no less important, and for him it has been, perhaps without his knowing it, a trying choice. Ultimately it is to the optical deficit between a representa- tional work of art and what it represents that the struggle between illusion and abstraction must be traced. The deficit of the third dimension in painting allows, on the one hand, the extremes of realism and naturalism and, on the other hand, encourages exploration in the opposite direction to- ward the strictly two-dimensional and the non-pictorial. In other words, there is considerable leeway. In sculpture as in painting there exists the fundamental deficit of the breath of life; otherwise, except for the usual but by no means necessary deficit of color, the leeway is not so great. Even this leeway should permit and encourage great varia- tions, but although abstraction in sculpture has led us to appreciate in isolation the luxurious beauty of certain ma terials, and to rediscover in solid geometry a pleasure akin to that which we feel in the presence of a magnificent tool TEN</page><page sequence="2">1HV NV31i3V4V .0O Vn3SnWv A3N1IHA (sau:u! inoj-A^J!ql) NVVqOM&amp; A lD38E)V18</page><page sequence="3">Right: AFRICAN BOY DANCING (sixteen inches) In the collection of the artist Left: HARMONICA PLAYER (eighteen inches) Collection Phillip Greene, Esq.</page><page sequence="4">or machine, abstraction has also led, sometimes, to the sup- position that the sculptor has merely created an inanimate object which can perform none of the functions of other inanimate objects and which cannot therefore give us so much pleasure as a fine machine or a handsome coffee-pot AFRICAN DANCER or a beautifully-made garment. And this perhaps is the (Forty-Four inches) reason why sculpture still keeps out of the still-life field and remains in the human, physical field: the distance from In the collection of the Whitney an inanimate object of actual use to an inanimate solid meant for a work of art is too small. We can always lay . hands on a stovepipe or a wheel, but we cannot always lay X ^ a hand on real fur or feathers or flesh and blood. Richmond Barthe is eminently a "physical" sculptor, in the sense of his being immensely interested in the physical and spiritual life of the human body, and very little con- cerned with mythological and literary ideas, the manufacture of decoration, or the pursuit of fascinating processes and materials-all things which admittedly have been at the bottom of much fine sculpture. The question, however, is whether "physical" is too broad a word. It includes sensu- ous and sensual; it includes sculpture observable at a purely visual level and sculpture that is perceived not visually but muscularly. If one may beg or defer the question for a moment, it may be said that with Barthe the physical is the vehicle of the spiritual. But death, or what is mortal, is not in his case swallowed up in victory, as with Lehm- bruck. Typical of his attitude is his comment on a second version of the standing figure of a woman whose hands are folded in prayer. For the first version, the late Rose McClendon, the Serena of Porgy, was the model. "Since she died," he says, "I can see her ever so much more clearly." And he feels that the second version will be better than the first. He is not, by the way, a Spiritualist. It is possible for an artist to learn anatomy as the medical student learns it, in the dissecting room; it is possible for any intelligent person to learn it (without regard to termin- ology) by drawing. But a sculptor needs more than that. He must have a better acquaintance with his own body than the bowing acquaintance that most people have; if he is also experienced in the management of the body, he has a useable knowledge of anatomy that is hard to beat. Barthe received at the school of the Art Institute of Chicago % the training given in the best sort of "artistic" anatomy course, with plenty of drawing. Just as importantly, he was later a student of dancing under Mary Radin of Martha Graham's group, and learned not only the most efficient, : handsome, and legible ways of standing and sitting and walking and falling, but also some of the ampler language .' of dancing. He is consequently not so distressfully de- dependent upon his models as are many sculptors: indeed, . models (whether the intractable hard-shell professional or . others) are at his mercy, for they are often obliged to do things which he is able to do and wants them to do. A sculptor with Barthe's equipment always has a head start on the empathy theory. To categorize tentatively-there have been super-physi- Museum cal sculptors, like Lachaise, who heroically amplified the human frame, and sub-physical sculptors, like the funereal THIRTEEN</page><page sequence="5">Left: EDGAR KAUFMAN, JR.

There have been pseudo-physical sculptors, like Canova, who substituted fiction for flesh; and anti- physical sculptors, like many surviving practitioners whose idealized antiseptic statuary makes up the bulk of "garden sculpture" and public monuments. And there have been plain physical sculptors like Jacopo della Quercia and Riemenschneider and Bernini and Pigalle and Eberlein and his collaborators at Meissen, yes, and alas! Rodin, certainly Despiau and Kolbe. This is not to say that Barthe, al- though of their company, has yet reached their stature; he is not forty, and, because he started late, he has not had a long career. Richmond Barthe was born at Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, on January 28, 1901. Under the encouragement of his parish priest, his gifts developed to a point where a profes- sional training was indicated. Being a Negro, he was DANCE (The Green Pastures) refused admission to a New Orleans academy, and even- tually went to Chicago, where his study was at first directed towards painting. He is a proficient pictorial draftsman, but has given up drawing. And although he does not plump for taille directe, his ideas are worked out from the beginning in three dimensions. It was almost by accident that he changed from painting to sculpture. In the latter field he has been self-taught; when he showed some of his early pieces to Jo Davidson, the elder man advised him not to go to school, or under- take any more formal instruction, but to behave like a sculptor at once. Barthe is not, however, unfriendly to academic discipline: one reads from his work a respect for tradition as a sort of Bureau of Standards. He says he does not want to go in for artificial stylization; he would rather simplify "naturally," keeping the spiritual and rythmic qualities of his figures. Nor is he very much interested in materials for variety's sake. Although he has produced terra-cottas and one popular success in marble, his work has usually been meant for casting, and his experi- ments have been largely with form modeled by addition. Some of his early work, slightly affected by Africa, but as much through other artists as directly, tended to elongation, abridgment of planes, and a metallic surface rather than a clay-translating one. The figures of less than life size in this technique were fine, particularly the Whitney Museum's Blackberry Woman, whose hard silhouette, legible from all around, is complemented by the beautiful view from above, in which one gets the full value of the spreading feet and the low-relief still life of leaves in the tops of the baskets. This style has given way, especially in works of larger dimensions, to a more dappled, impressionistic surface, more sensuous modeling, and a greater detail which does not always justify itself. At the same time, Barthe has with- drawn from the anecdote, and seems to prefer concentration on subjects in which he can deal with construction and motion, and with the spiritual qualities that are written in and readable from physical effects. Not long ago he made portrait busts of Maurice Evans as Richard II and of John Gielgud as Hamlet. The first, a skin-deep representation Model for a forty foot frieze for Harlem River Houses of the actor wearing a false beard and making a histrionic gesture with one hand, is not very distinguished. The latter, despite a few broadly-indicated details of costume, is a believable portrait of a personality, with no more reference to the stage than one sees in the best of the eighteenth-century portraits at the Comedie Frangaise. It is not so much a view of Hamlet hiding in John Gielgud's skin as of John Gielgud, a man capable of playing Hamlet. Barthe inclines to attribute this difference to the fact that the bony structure of Evans' head is less well made than Gielgud's. There may be something in this: certainly one sitter appeals to an artist more than another; but more probably it is the crepe hair and the extraneity of the hand that stultify the Evans bust. Barthe is now working on a portrait of Katherine Cornell which promises to be the best of all; no masquerade, but a vera effigies. Similarly, there are certain figure compositions of his which suffer by adopting a little of the white man's attitude to the Negro subject. The Lindy Hop group, for example, is suitably funny, but it seems to imply the patronizing spectator. And in the monumental Mother and Son, shown at the New York World's Fair, 1939, there is a faint, disturbing feeling that the Negro facial characteristics have FIFTEEN</page><page sequence="7">Left: ROSE McCLENDON (life size) as Serena in "Porgy" Right: SHOE SHINE BOY (life size) Dudley Allen Memorial Art Museum of Oberlin College</page><page sequence="8">been added at the last moment to the expression of an universal idea. The work is, nevertheless, an impressive change from the usual exclamatory style of anti-lynching propaganda. It is rather in those figures, the subject of which is the Negro as a person and personality different from the white, that Barthe has done his most successful work. These are not merely representations of models; it does not need a Negro sculptor to observe the high shoulders, the extended heels, the special skull construction of the Negro. They are realizations of the racial genius for concentrating on an emotional state to the limit of the powers of the body. Such are the Benga and Wetta, the sweetly dignified but almost trance-like African Boy Dancing, and the big Afri- can Dancer. Such, we hope, will be the long bas-reliefs, commissioned for the outdoor stairways of Harlem Houses, the designs for which are based on the dances and pro- cessions of The Green Pastures. Barthe's latest work is represented by the Boy with a Flute of the 1940 Whitney Museum exhibition. In it, as against the invented free-standing composition of the Blackberry Womzan, he has made a highly illusory life-size image. It is a question whether he will go on from this to new exer- cises in the anthropomorphic, or take another direction. He feels that it is inevitable that the present stage of his work should be fairly academic, and the point of view from which he looks forward to his future is a detached one, almost like that of a novelist whose characters have taken matters into their own hands. To pursue the analogy, one might say that his use of subjects off the beaten aca- demic track in a fashion which to conservatives is unex- ceptionable, is like the method of the most high-toned writers of thrillers (the late John Buchan, for example), who use a standard literary technique as a vehicle for out- landish plots. It is too easy and too tempting to compare Barthe's Negro figures to Malvina Hoffman's, whose pur- pose is entirely different. Barthe wants to go to Africa. When he does go he will undoubtedly profit as a person from the experience, but one must wonder what his sculpture can gain from it EXODUS (The Green Pastures) beyond some new variations of subject. He has undergone the charms and rejected the influence of African sculpture, possibly because he did not come into contact with it until after his school training. On the whole, it is more im- portant that he is a twentieth-century American than that he is a Negro, especially as he has probably been less affected by the racial dilemma than most Americans who are also Negroes. Another wish of his is to do religious work. His interest in the revelation of spiritual content through physical effects leads in that direction. Besides, he is a Roman Catholic with an understanding of the problems presented by the vulgar confectionery of much Church decoration. He wants to take part in the finding of a remedy which shall be neither the wishy-washy pseudo-manly Nordic one nor the insistently realistic and up-to-date Semitic one, neither the cute ceramics of the Wiener Werkstatte nor the Yankee notions of modern dress for the sake of modern dress. There have been so many laudable intentions in this respect and so few real results (Jean Charlot's Stations of the Cross and some of the less compromising works of Dominikus B6hm and Eric Gill) that one is skeptical about new ones, but still hopeful. Barthe is anxious to emphasize the personal charm of Christ and His popularity during His human life. "Jesus was always being asked out to dinner. People were crazy about Him," he says. "He was always going to weddings and other parties and enjoying them." And this, I take it, has nothing to do either with the Baroque desire to charm or with the conventional theory of the Negro fondness for entertainment. It is simply the attitude of a man who has none of the old-plantation nonsense about him but who finds the homely features of religion no less import- ant than its doctrine. When he goes ahead, what he ac- complishes will be very much a function of his personal mixture of the cultivated Negro and the modern Roman Catholic. He makes no pretence of having a great plan for the next twenty-five years, is willing to take new direc- tions if they do not seem to be capricious, and is not ashamed to cast his burden on the Lord.
