ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA In the autumn of 1982, Andean archaeology lost two of its most respected specialists-Yoshitaro Amano, in Lima, and Gary Vescelius, in Puerto Rico. Shortly before his death, Vescelius had accepted the task of completing the Huaca Prieta report, based on the ex- cavations of Bird, his mentor and close friend since youth. Happily, John Hyslop (Institute of Andean Re- search) is completing the project at the American Mu- seum, where the Huaca Prieta report will be published as an Anthropological Paper. According to Hyslop, Bird's notes and other records are in very good order, so the volume should be ready soon. Andean archaeology is in a period of reorganization, from which new syntheses have already begun to emerge. Despite international economic difficulties, scholars from Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, France, Germany, Peru, Spain, and the United States were able to meet in Guayaquil, October 25th to 30th, for a conference in homage to Carlos Zevallos Menedez, pioneer of Ecuadorian archaeology. In keep- ing with the spirit of the "Paracas conference" and the even more recent Circumpunefia symposium at San Pedro de Atacama, the object was to evaluate the utility and applicability of the culture area concept in the northern Andes and, especially, Ecuador. A major two- day session resulted in the definition of four sub-areas, or regions, published as a supplement to volume 1, no. 5, of the Gaceta Arqueologica Andina. The trend toward more intense data analysis con- tinues, as various laboratories and university centers strive to strengthen this aspect of their operations. Giv- en financial restrictions, large scale excavations often have to be cut back so that collections already in hand can be cared for and studied properly. In La Paz, Arica, and even San Pedro de Atacama, museum personnel inform me that laudable conservationist policies, re- flecting this ethic, have been deliberately and publicly adopted. The Catholic University in Lima has been a leader in emphasizing analytic facilities, even to pro- visions for radiocarbon dating, while, in Guayaquil, Louis Burnell is setting up a laboratory for metallurg- ical and chemical studies at the Central Bank's Mu- seum of Anthropology. In addition to microscopy and wet chemistry, the laboratory will be equipped for basic restoration and preservation of metal artifacts. Scholars with an orientation toward art and art his- tory have demonstrated that one does not always need expensive new equipment for deeper analysis of exist- ing collections. Previously opened mummy bundles from Paracas Necropolis have provided Anne Paul (University of Georgia) and Susan Niles (Lafayette Col- lege) with two seasons of work in the Textile Depart- ment of the National Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology in Lima. Beyond the study of color and iconography, they have achieved a detailed under- standing of the structure and fabrication of the richly embroidered funerary garments. From the work pat- tern of a single mantle, for example, they determined the participation of at least 13 artisans. Anita Cook (Colgate University) continues her in- vestigation of Huari and Tiwanaku symbolism on ar- tifacts that convey pictographic information, usually in ceremonial or political contexts. She hopes that pat- tern and variation in the widespread symbolic system will elucidate the interactions and expansion processes of the two political spheres. A detailed examination of the Pikillaqta figurines and related finds at Huari sites indicates that turquoise was a highly valued exchange 416</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH product, likely to be important in the symbolic system. Cook would like to hear from colleagues about other middle horizon turquoise representations, especially examples of cultivated plants, animals, or weapons. ECUADOR. Under the direction of Presley Nor- ton, excavations continue at Salango, on the south cen- tral coast just north of the Santa Elena Peninsula. In one area the entire coastal ceramic sequence (Valdivia, Machalilla, Chorrera, Bahia, Guangala, Mantefo) is stratigraphically superimposed to a depth of 5.8 m. In another, specialists evidently processed Spondylus and other shell into beads, amulets, and lime during the Manteiio period, A.D. 800 to 1550. A low, 10 by 10- m-square platform mound with stepped adobe sides, prepared clay walls, and courses of stones used as boundary markers, contained a concentration of Bahia burials. Elsewhere, radiocarbon samples, associated with Valdivia sherds nested among mangrove roots, yielded ages of 4510 ? 210 B.P. (GX-8962) and 4670 ? 195 B.P. (GX-8964). Kent Mathewson (U of Wisconsin) provides addi- tional information on the Samborondon survey, in the Guayas Basin, mentioned last year. NSF and Central Bank support was provided, in addition to funding by Fulbright-Hays and the Escuela Politecnica del Litoral (ESPOL), with the cooperation of Jorge Marcos, Olaf Holm, and Presley Norton. The radiocarbon dates pre- viously cited (A.D. 605 and 685; American Antiquity 47:171) indicate that raised-field building on the mid- dle Babahoyo River took place during the period of population increase ascribed to the Milagro-Quevedo phase. Ceramic graters and stone manos and metates, found in and on raised fields and associated house mounds, suggest both maize and manioc processing. Some habitation mounds exceeded 1 ha in area, while canals, borrow pits, and enlarged stream courses cre- ated a hydraulic transportation network that was also valuable for production of aquatic animal proteins. Causeways, one of which appears to be built of stone, probably served for ground transport. Tolas (ceremon- ial mounds) occur adjacent to, but apparently not with- in, the raised field complexes. The area of the Guayas Basin covered by raised fields and associated features approaches 50,000 ha in ten or more disjunct com- plexes. Great differences in patterning raise the pos- sibility of variation in age and origin. One of the most distinctive sites, with long parallel fields, is Penion del Rio, opposite Guayaquil on the east bank of the Ba- bahoyo. Dating from the Valdivia to the Milagro- Quevedo phases, this major site is now being excavated by the ESPOL field school led by Jorge Marcos. At the end of 1982 Patricia Netherly (U of Massa- chusetts) began a new phase of the Tahuin Dam Proj- ect, on the middle Arenillas River in El Oro Province. Funded by the Banco Central in Guayaquil, this began in 1978-1979 with an extensive survey and some test excavations. In 1982, portions of several structures were uncovered at the Romero village site, about 55 km from the Gulf of Guayaquil, which dates from the middle period of Jambeli influence in the region. Fau- nal remains are well preserved and exhibit high pro- portions of estuarine fish and mollusks. Netherly plans further research in the middle and lower Arenillas as soon as the severe flooding caused by El Nifio has receded. NORTHERN PERU. The fifth field season of the Batan Grande-La Leche project was conducted by Izumi Shimada (Harvard U) with support by the National Geographic Society. There were extensive excavations at Huaca del Pueblo Batan Grande and Cerro de los Cementerios, together with surface surveys of Cerro Santoyo, the forest of Colan, and the region of Jotoro. A study was also made of the gold artifacts in the Bruning Museum of Lambayeque. Kathryn Cleland (U of California at Los Angeles [UCLA]) and Alvaro Higueras (Catholic U of Lima) carried out the excavation of a block 9 by 5.5 by 5 m deep in the Huaca del Pueblo Batan Grande, formerly thought to be a rural habitation mound. However, three smelting furnaces, a well-built oven, storage room, and other elaborate features caused Shimada to reconsider his opinion. In the 30 historic and prehistoric layers many walls, rooms, and terraces were recognized. Twelve burials, some with elaborate furnishings, were recovered, along with over 16,000 sherds which will be studied with particular emphasis on the evolution of Sican style during the Middle Horizon. Stephen Epstein (U of Pennsylvania) conducted the excavations at Cerro de los Cementerios, with the aim of clarifying the development of copper alloy smelting technology from the Middle to the Late Horizon, as well as the degree of functional and spatial differenti- tation within the site and sector. The T-shaped plat- form was confirmed to be an administrative structure and one of the closely spaced, self-contained work- shops (for smelting and slag grinding) was excavated to bedrock. Within the two meters of floors and fill, they identified 20 relinings and levels of smelters, re- sulting from nearly continuous rebuilding and rapid accumulation of refuse. Strong technological continu- ity is suggested for at least 600 years from the Middle Sican period. In another sector Heather Lechtman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) accomplished a short investigation of what she tentatively interprets as annealing ovens. Shimada concludes that he can no longer speak of a single metallurgical center; rather, he must characterize the whole region of the central La Leche Valley as a center from at least the Late Inter- mediate period through the Late Horizon. More de- tailed information on this and other projects will be found in the Willay newsletters distributed by Izumi and Melody Shimada. At Montegrande, 40 km from the coast in the Je- quetepeque Valley, Michael Tellenbach (Deutsches Ar- chaiologisches Institut) has been leading salvage exca- vations for the Gallito Ciego irrigation project. By the end of the 1982 season he had mapped and partially excavated a 12,000-m2 area of formative settlement and sanctuaries, on the second of three "mesetas," or probable fan deposits, on the north side of the valley. Even before excavation, numerous walls, terraces, plat- forms, patios, and enclosures were visible from the air. From their own work they have added ceremonial hearths (covered with clay), deposits, formal stairways, and a relief sculpture of a head surrounded by snakes and with snake heads issuing from its mouth. Equally interesting are the investigations of the rectangular 417</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY habitations, often arranged in lines or enclosed by fences, with interior quadrangular hearths and benches or plat- forms. Houses are grouped around the plazas and tem- ple structures and share the same ceramic ware, which bears resemblances to Huacaloma Temprana, Kotosh- Kotosh, and Cupisnique. However, sherds of bottles and bowls appear more frequently within the rooms, while neckless ollas and large plates are more common outside. A later ware, associated with the last construc- tion phase of the principal temple of the upper terrace, has bottle shapes absent in Huacaloma Temprana and shares features with the early Ancon ware. Tellenbach is partial to the idea that Montegrande and Early Cup- isnique precede the Classic Chavin style of the high- lands. The aims of the 1982 expedition to the Cajamarca Valley, led by Kazuo Terada (U of Tokyo), were (1) to complete the investigations at Huacaloma, begun in 1979, extending the excavations eastward in Mound 1 and toward Mound 2; (2) to define the cultural context of the Layz6n culture through extensive excavations in the type site; (3) to clarify the chronology of the Cajamarca culture. At Huacaloma the direct super- position of the late style over the early style was es- tablished with the discovery of a 2-m-thick cap of clay over the early constructions. Twenty-five cm into this stratum a 9-m-long dressed-stone drainage canal was laid, reminiscent of those at San Lorenzo. Terada also reports retaining walls, contiguous rooms with dividing walls and niches, and even a fragment of a seven-color mural with a typically Formative feline face. First reported by the seventeenth-century traveler Martinez de Compafion, Layzon is a hilltop site located at 3,200 meters elevation, by kilometer 9 of the road to Cumbemayo. Excavations by Yasutake Kato (Sai- tama U) revealed six platforms, some connected by stairways, cut into the bedrock on the west side of the hill. Reliefs cut into the side of the lowest platform established affiliation with the Late Huacaloma period and are also likened to those at Chavin. The uppermost 40 x 40-m-temple platform at Layzon, with its 6-m- high retaining walls, belongs to the Late Formative period. Atop the platform are circular constructions of dressed-stone inner and outer walls filled with rubble. Ryozo Matzumoto (Tokai U) was responsible for excavations at several later sites near Cajamarca, through which it proved possible to re-establish a phase (Reichlen's Cajamarca II?) between Early and Middle Cajamarca, subdivide Middle Cajamarca, associate Late Cajamarca with Wari style, and show Incaic stylistic influence in Final Cajamarca. Other studies in Cajamarca in 1982 by Carlos Wil- liams and Jose Pineda (Lima) considered Layzon, Hu- alanga Orco, Conchorco, Santa Apolonia, and the ir- rigation works of Cumbemayo as parts of an integrated Formative ceremonial center. In their view, the inte- grative element, to which the ceremonial structures were oriented, was the elaborate, sometimes cut-stone, 9,100-m-long canal, first described by Petersen, which brought water from the Cerro Cumbe to a much lower reservoir. In a second season at Marcahuamachuco, in the Con- debamba Basin, John and Theresa Topic (Trent U) excavated in three sectors and mapped about half of the site. In addition, four Inca colcas were tested on Cerro Santa Barbara, and project personnel conducted several short surveys of adjacent zones. Above 3,700 m only small windbreaks and a rockshelter were lo- cated. Most use of this upper zone seems to have been temporary and late. The mid-altitude zone (3,200-3,700 m) yielded sites ranging in age from the Early Horizon to the Late. One was fortified, and one had colcas (San- ta Barbara), but most appear to be simple rural com- munities. A lower zone, west of Marcahuamachuco, seems to have had especially dense Late Intermediate Period (LIP) occupation. Local LIP ceramics are now much better defined, although the virtual absence of Inca wares, or even of provincial imitations, is puz- zling. The dark brown-on-white cursive ware, first thought to be imported from Cajamarca, was probably made locally. The Topics are certain that Marcahuamachuco both predates and survives Wari expansion by several cen- turies. They tentatively see the northwards push by Wari as accompanied by, and preceded by, a gravity pull by Marcahuamachuco. The reasons for the estab- lishment of the intrusive Viracochapampa site, built rapidly with organized labor but never finished, still need to be elucidated. NORTH CENTRAL PERU. In their 1982 season, Ulana Klymyshyn (U of California-Santa Barbara) and Carol Mackey (California State U-Northridge) exca- vated at both Manchan and Laguna II, southern Chimu administrative centers in the Casma Valley. At the larger Manchan site, 1981 testing was followed with full-scale work in three adobe compounds, two sand- fill mounds walled with stone or adobe, and an adobe mortuary compound with intact, underground, Chimu tombs. Excavation in four cane-walled houses, under- lying the adobe structures, showed that the site's orig- inal inhabitants were Chimu. Colonial documents in- dicating that Manchan was part of a sixteenth-century encomienda were archaeologically substantiated. Mov- ing 5 km east to Laguna II, Mackey and Klymyshyn mapped the site and dug enough cane and adobe struc- tures to show that it ranked lower in the Chimu ad- ministrative hierarchy but had pre-Chimu beginnings. R. T. Zuidema (U of Illinois) spent the summer of 1982 authenticating Hernandez Principe's seven- teenth-century account of the construction of a pre- hispanic irrigation system near Ocros in the Pativilca Valley. With Manuel Burga (U of San Marcos) he found the tomb of the responsible curaca, the shafttomb of the curaca's sacrificially buried daughter, and the ruins of the towns inhabited by the original and transported farmers. Jeffrey Quilter (Ripon College) continued his work in the lower Chillon Valley into the 1983 season, rein- vestigating, as part of his study of changing settlement patterns, the middens at El Paraiso. Preliminary study of the shells, by Dan Sandweiss (Cornell U) may show the transition from late preceramic to the Intermediate Period in shifts in exploitation of mollusk species. Quilter's work at Cerro Media Luna in 1982 suggests that that may not be a preceramic ceremonial site after all; in fact the circular pits surrounding the temple were probably made in recent years by la cultura militar. 418 [Vol. 49, No. 2, 1984]</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH Working with Craig Morris (American Museum) in the Chincha Valley, Sandweiss believes that he located the fishermen's settlement on a long, narrow bluff over- looking the sea and running north from the Chincha and Inca administrative center at Huaca Centinela. Other quarters, south of the huaca, have been much disturbed by recent cultivation. Supported by Fulbright and Lounsbery fellowships, Sandweiss began excava- tions in the residential area in 1983. In following sea- sons he will define the spatial and temporal limits of the fishing settlement and investigate a presumed shell workshop on a platform in an associated mound group. Elias Mujica (Catholic U of Lima) and Maria Rost- worowski (Instituto de Estudios Peruanos) have begun an interdisciplinary study of the lomas zone between the Lurin and Chilca valleys south of Lima. Catholic U students in the new Archaeology Specialty partici- pated in the 1982 season, which sought to define the populations exploiting the lomas zone through space and time, using archaeological and historical infor- mation. Recent analysis of Lavallee's (Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique [CNRS]) Telarmachay col- lections from Junin, accomplished by Jane Wheeler (Florida State Museum), indicates camelid domesti- cation in preceramic times, 4000 to 3500 B.C. Rect- angular alpaca-type incisors, with enamel only on the labial surface, together with lower molars having poor- ly developed buttresses, may indicate controlled breed- ing, as does the sharp increase in the frequency of re- mains of newborn, reported in this column in 1982. Investigations at a similar site (Panaulauca), also in Junin, were continued in 1982 by John Rick (Stanford U). Rick writes that he is down to "mid-late" precer- amic levels, having excavated 22 layers and 217 cul- tural features. Test pits at the cave mouth and on the talus were taken down to sterile clay, passing first through earlier preceramic levels with artifacts like those at Pachamachay, and then through culturally sterile levels with abundant carnivore-chewed bone. Espe- cially interesting finds include an Intermediate Period pit house, a bird burial, hearths, postholes, pits (some filled with large rocks), areally differentiated lithic in- dustries, and seven late preceramic burials. The burials are notable for hematite, textile "ghosts," and, in two cases, "a mature adult placed in a 'dominant' and for- mal posture above an informally positioned young fe- male." A survey of neighboring chert sources was carried out and the Chupacancha shelter, 9 km northwest, was tested. Below abundant ceramic-bearing levels were dense preceramic layers with five burials. Analytic work in Rick's project thus far has concentrated on paleo- zoology, paleoethnobotany, and stylistic and function- al dimensions of the stone tool kits. Floral and faunal remains should help document domestication as well as the continued use of wild resources. The Upper Mantaro research project completed its 1982 season under the co-direction of Timothy Earle (UCLA), Terence D'Altroy (Columbia U), Christine Hastorf (U of Minnesota), and Catherine LeBlanc (Maxwell Museum, U of New Mexico). Excavations were conducted at Tunanmarca, a large fortified LIP center; Umpamalca, a smaller and probably politically dependent LIP settlement; and Marca, a moderate- sized Lake Horizon settlement near the Inca center of Hatun Xauxa. Excavations focus on clusters of resi- dential and burial structures occupied by Huanca households. These architectural clusters are well pre- served at Tunanmarca and Umpamalca, where some time was spent mapping and collecting architectural information on household groups. From the previous work on the LIP Huanca, it seems Tunanmarca may have been the sociopolitical center of a small-scale chiefdom that also included Umpamalca. Excavations are designed to verify social strata and examine the basis of stratification, for example within the economic sphere, in ritual and military authority. They are also working on the organization of the Huanca household itself, through analysis of activity distributions within and among household groups. SOUTHERN PERU. Persis Clarkson (U of Cal- gary) and Jonathan Damp traversed nearly 1,000 km of the Nasca Pampa and bordering foothills, omitting only the northwestern section (protected from survey by law) which contains the majority of gigantic ground figures. The aim of their survey was to locate and record all visible evidence of human presence, rather than to study the geoglyphs themselves. Ceramics, stone tools, cairns, rock lines, and circles were located on maps, then drawn and/or photographed in the field. Although Damp and Clarkson found a few sherds attributable to the Early Intermediate Period, the vast majority in association with lines pertain to the Middle Horizon and LIP. They found little evidence to support the conventional belief that the geoglyphs were contem- poraneous with Nasca pottery. Earlier efforts to date the figures relied upon functional interpretations, while others depended on stratigraphic intrusions or asso- ciations of cultural remains in an area where there has been little, if any, geologic deposition in thousands of years. Until a complete survey of the area of the ground figures is made, no definite conclusions can be drawn about their temporal or cultural affiliation from sherd collections alone. Enrique Bragayrac and Enrique Gonzalez (Instituto Andino de Estudios Arqueologicos) report the latest excavations at Wari, in the sector known as Vega- chayoq-Moqo, between Capillapata and Mojachoyoq. Vegachayoq-Moqo is a roughly pyramidal mound, sur- rounded on three sides by plazas, which are, in turn, surrounded by high walls. Most of the anthropomorph- ic sculptures associated with Wari seem to have come from this area, which, because it is approached by a wide street, has been identified as a major temple. The frontal area of the mound was excavated and cleaned for conservation and restoration, soundings were made to determine critical orientations, and a detailed map was prepared. Altars, formal hearths, niches, circular enclosures, and secondary burials in tombs in the outer wall all reinforce the interpretation of Vegachayoq- Moqo as a sacred area. On these pages in 1983, I mistakenly reported work in the Soras or Chicha Valley, led by Monica Barnes (Community College of Allegheny County), as having been associated with the work of Frank Meddens (U of London). The third season of Meddens' Chicha Ar- 419</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY chaeological Project, once again undertaken indepen- dently, took place in 1982, when he investigated re- gional cultural development, looking specifically at provincial aspects of Wari. Extensive survey in a 30- km stretch of the valley revealed at least 54 sites, the earliest of which he believes dates to the Muyu Moqo C-D phase of the Intermediate Period. After an ap- parent gap preceding the Middle Horizon (MH), Med- dens sees continuous occupation up to the present day. Some of the terrace systems date to the MH, but ir- rigation canals are few, indicating mainly seasonal cul- tivation of the terraces. Likewise, Meddens writes that he has found no examples of typical Wari or Inca style buildings, but that he is considering the possibility that mitamaes were introduced for labor during the first half of the MH. Excavation and mapping of Chiqna Jota show it to have been the main center from the early MH until the second half of the LIP, when oc- cupation appears to have shifted north and Aukimarca is seen to have become the most important settlement. Based on her own work in 1981, Barnes is less sure that the important Aukimarca site surpassed Soras it- self. She favors an important role for irrigation, even before Inca times, noting the abundance of water from glacially-fed springs and rivers. Barnes identifies canals and sites with classical Inca architectural features, in- cluding cylindrical stone thatch pegs and trapezoidal doorways, windows, and niches built of fine, dressed masonry. She finds evidence of Huarpa occupation (be- fore the MH) at four sites. Gordon McEwan (U of Texas) reports that he com- pleted his survey of the entire Lucre Basin late in 1982. Surface collections from 20 sites suggest a more exten- sive Wari occupation than had been suspected, perhaps indicating a greater Wari impact on the culture history of the southern highlands. All of the sites surveyed were mapped, while Pikillacta, Rayallacta, and Choquepu- kio were chosen for intensive investigation of archi- tecture, site planning and ceramic associations. Mc- Ewan excavated 21 test units at Pikillacta, sampling all architectural types but concentrating on the colcas, which showed no evidence of having been used pri- marily for storage. Rather, they yielded domestic refuse of various types, and even hearths. He suggests that they were military quarters or houses for corvee labor. Dating the construction and occupation of Pikillacta will depend on a number of radiocarbon samples and ceramic comparisons, but McEwan is already certain that it is fundamentally Wari. From the depth (up to 3 m) and quantity of cultural material in the middens, as well as the varied and complex structures, a sub- stantial duration seems certain. Test pits at Choque- pukio and Rayallacta also indicate both Wari and LIP use. According to Juana Maysundo, the COPESCO res- toration project of 1982 at Wiracocha, executed by the National Institute of Culture, suggests that this "tem- ple" or kallanca was built to seal the Inca-Colla alli- ance. Located at Raqchi (Canchis Province) in the headwaters of the Vilcanota, it lies near the south- eastern limit of the Cuzco Valley agricultural system, where it meets the altiplano herding tradition. Ce- ramics associated with the construction of Wiracocha itself are Inca (imperial and local), Inca-Colla, and Col- la. Below this they found levels with evidence of Wari, Pukara-Qaluyu, and Qaluyu-Marcavalle occupation. The "temple" was built upon an artifically-leveled plat- form and the present stability of the walls is undoubt- edly due in part to stone foundations, cemented with clay, reaching as much as 85 cm below ground surface. Investigations were also made in the plazas, colcas, Mesapata (where there are structures associated with a spring that filled an artificial pond), and the Yana- mancha sector, which appears to have been the elite quarters on the banks of the river. The Contisuyu Program, directed by Robert Feld- man (Field Museum) and Fernando Cabieses (Peru- vian Museum of Health Sciences), is a long-term study of the prehistory and ecology of the Moquegua De- partment. The goals are to inventory the prehistoric and early historic sites, conduct excavations and res- torations at selected sites with a view toward tourism, and establish a regional research center. Initial funding has come entirely from private sources, principally the Southern Peru Copper Corporation, which operates the Cuajone Mine in Moquegua. Preliminary surveys by Feldman and his Peruvian counterparts, Luis Wata- nabe and Carlos Williams, have identified a large num- ber of sites on aerial photographs and on the ground. These include Inca settlements and storehouses, Ti- wanaku cemeteries, geoglyphs, caves with wall paint- ings, and lithic workshops, camps, and scatters. Ex- cavations will be conducted at Cerro Baul, a large mesa- top settlement which local tradition identifies as Gar- cilaso de la Vega's site of local resistance to the Inca conquest. Amidst the ruins of stone walls they have also found sherds of Wari age or style, possibly in- cluding the Chakipampa and Ocros types. The 1983 season found Michael Moseley (Field Museum) and James Richardson (Carnegie Museum) on the ground too, as a research base was set up in the city of Mo- quegua. Thomas F. Lynch FAR NORTH The 1982 field season was characterized by a modest level of archaeological activity in the north. This ap- pears to have been an especially quiet year along the arctic coast of Canada, scene of considerable archae- ological activity in recent years. Nevertheless, some striking discoveries were made. William Irving and his collaborators obtained additional in situ evidence which in their opinion confirms the presence of man in the northern Yukon during the Sangamon interglacial. Ear- ly Holocene material was obtained in good stratigraph- ic context at the FAI-091 site on the Teklanika River in interior Alaska while further light was thrown upon the late Arctic Small Tool tradition occupation of Ka- chemak Bay on the North Pacific. Additional evidence for the probable co-occurrence of side-notched projec- tile points and microblades in the Alaskan interior and an Eskimo penetration south of the Brooks Range along the Coleen River also are noteworthy. In terms of media attention this was clearly the Year of the Burial in the north. The finding of five late pre- 420 [Vol. 49, No. 2, 1984]</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH historic Eskimos crushed in a house overrun by sea ice at Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska has provided a most unusual opportunity to study the proverbial moment frozen in time as well as the physiology and state of health of two of these individuals whose bodies were preserved in ice for several hundred years. Methodologically interesting approaches included a trace element analysis of strontium in the bones of six north Alaskan Eskimo populations, undertaken by Melissa Conner and Dale Slaughter (Wisconsin, Mad- ison), in an attempt to index relative degree of depen- dence upon sea mammals. It appears possible to dis- tinguish populations dependent upon sea mammals from populations dependent upon fish on the basis of the significantly higher frequency of strontium in the bones of the sea mammal hunters. In light of present interest in taphonomy, and controversy over the sig- nificance of certain Pleistocene finds in the Yukon Ter- ritory, the study of D'Andrea and Gotthardt (sum- marized below) of the impact of carnivore activity upon recently killed horse remains acquires particular inter- est as one of a small number of taphonomic studies conducted upon northern materials. Finally, 1982 wit- nessed the publication of Paleoecology of Beringia (D. M. Hopkins et al., eds; Academic Press). This new multi-authored synthesis commands the attention of all who have more than a passing interest in the coming of humans to the Americas, and partially supercedes the classic The Bering Land Bridge which appeared 15 years ago. SOUTHEAST ALASKA. Larry Roberts reports that archaeologists of the Stikine Area, Tongass Na- tional Forest, expended considerable effort in docu- menting early twentieth-century mining activity at the Hattie Camp Claims (PET- 166) on Woewodski Island. In addition, two small seasonal historic camps were located in Frosty Bay on the Cleveland Peninsula. As- sociated with these camps were rock alignments in the intertidal zone which were apparently designed to sup- port watercraft. Historic sources indicate the presence of several seasonal villages in the immediate area. Two cabin ruins which may shed some light on seasonal settlement during the last 40 to 50 years were located in the Duncan Canal area on Kupreanof Island. A sin- gle garden site was recorded in the same area. Sixteen axe-cut fish weir stakes enclosing a 4 x 2.5-m area were located in Fritter Cove on the east side of Zarembo Island (PET-162). Other stakes as- sociated with this fish weir may have been buried by tidal deposition. While there are some traces of historic activity in the area, there are no data bearing directly on the age of the weir. A series of stone fish traps of considerable size and complexity was located on the tidal flat east of the mouth of Kwatahein Creek where it empties into the Bay of Pillars on Kuiu Island (XPA- 083). Six cultural features made up of cobbles and small boulders were recognized. The area enclosed by the stone traps may have been quite extensive at one time. Brief inspection of the surrounding area revealed a garden plot in possible association with the fish trap area. Craig Davis, Harvey Shields and David Staley (Na- tional Park Service [NPS]) tested at the Russian Bish- op's House in Sitka. A recent concrete driveway and several postmolds of uncertain affinity were discov- ered. Davis and Staley also tested at the Kiksadi Indian Fort National Register site, the scene of a battle be- tween Russians and Sitka Tlingit for control of the area in 1804. Some features, including a possible postmold and a concentration of large stones, were found. These might be related to the east wall of the fort. Davis and William Brown examined a stone feature on Cenotaph Island, Lityua Bay, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, believed to be a monument erected to the dead of the LaPerouse expedition in 1786. Con- trolled tests revealed that the stone had not been placed as a monument. The original LaP6rouse cenotaph is now believed to have been destroyed. Davis and Brown also conducted a brief archaeological reconnaissance of the island, finding only commemorative markers and remains of two recent tent frames. GULF OF ALASKA. An archaeological recon- naissance of the Silver Lake Hydroelectric Project area in Prince William Sound directed by Charles Mobley (Alaska Heritage Resource Group [AHRS]) noted sev- eral features probably related to copper mining early in the twentieth century. Ethnohistorical research was conducted at the village of Tatitlek to elucidate tra- ditional land use practices. Two concentrations of sub- surface charcoal (one in association with three surface depressions) discovered on the shore of a lagoon on Galena Bay may reflect prehistoric activities. Richard Stern and Douglas Gibson (Alaska Depart- ment of Geological and Geophysical Surveys [ADGGS]) surveyed the site of the New Chenega village location on Evans Island in western Prince William Sound. A stone lamp was found on the beach near the village. The dilapidated and partially burned remains of a can- nery on Crab Bay and a saltry on Sawmill Bay were photographed and mapped. Peter Zollars (Alaska, Anchorage) and one assistant devoted six weeks to excavation of the late Arctic Small Tool tradition component at the base of the SEL-033 site on Chugachik Island in Kachemak Bay. Forty-one diagnostic artifacts and about 1,400 waste flakes were recovered from 29 m3 of deposit. Diagnostic imple- ments included 20 projectile points and fragments, three knife-like implements, five scrapers, a lightly ground adze, a stitched birchbark fragment, and a slender clyindrical end-grooved baked shale rod of uncertain function. While none of the calcined bone fragments can be identified with certainty, some appear to be in the size range of rodents or birds. Seventy-five percent of the stone utilized was exotic material seldom found in later sites in Kachemak Bay. This preference for non-local stone, the typology of the collection and lack of evidence for the utilization of shellfish underscore the distinctiveness of this basal material when com- pared with the overlying main Kachemak tradition de- posits. Three small (under 50 cm) round-to-oval fire pits, several of which are partly outlined or lined with stones, were also recorded. The basal occupation at SEL-033 appears to represent an incursion of Arctic Small Tool tradition technology from the Bering Sea drainage to the North Pacific. Douglas Reger (ADGGS) surveyed and tested sev- 421</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY eral sites on the Kenai Peninsula. Tests at the Clam Gulch site in 1981 and 1982 yielded a faunal assem- blage dominated by marine forms, a variety of barbed bone points, a slate point, an adze bit, worked shell and a birchbark basket. Four radiocarbon dates place the site between ca. 1600 and 1750 A.D. Reger continued excavations at the Moose River site (KEN-043) at the confluence of the Moose and Kenai rivers, recovering additional artifacts from the lower level dated from ca. 300 B.C. to 500 A.D. A pit house ruin from that time period was reoccupied about 1700 A.D. There was also an intermediate occupation which may date around 1500 A.D. The most recent occu- pation yielded a very small collection of bone artifacts. Douglas Gibson and Craig Mishler (also ADGGS) examined an eight mile (ca. 12.9 km) stretch of the Sterling Highway on the Kenai Peninsula, discovering two historic sites. They also examined the Ninilchik State Recreation Area prior to its development, doc- umenting the twentieth-century homestead and fox farm at that location. ALASKA PENINSULA. Harvey Shields (NPS) began a two year excavation program in the Brooks River Archeological District, Katmai National Mon- ument and Preserve. Two eroding sites, BR-3 (XMK- 016) and BR-6 (XMK-034), are the focus of the pro- gram. Five of the eleven cultural phases defined by Don Dumond for this part of the Alaska Peninsula occur at these two sites, with the oldest remains dated to some 4,400 years ago. The bulk of the material at both sites is related to the Brooks River Bluff phase dated between A.D. 1450 and A.D. 1800. The research design centers upon the study of the economy and ad- aptation of the people who lived at Brooks River during this time period. Excavations in 1982 opened up an 8 x 12 m block on BR-3, incorporating what was thought to be an isolated house pit. During the 10- week field season only the late prehistoric levels were excavated. These turned out to include not only the entire target house, but portions of three other smaller houses as well. The target house turned out to be youn- ger than the three on the periphery. Preliminary anal- ysis indicates that it may be a kashgee or men's house. Hiroaki and Atsuko Okada (Hokkaido University) completed their fourth season of excavation at the large, rich and ancient Hot Springs village site at Port Moller, but the details of this work are not available. WESTERN AND NORTHERN ALASKA. Charles Holmes and Richard Stern (ADGGS) examined the material source for new airport construction at Deering on the Seward Peninsula. The Inupiat Eskimo village of Inmachukmiut was reported to be in the vicinity of the material source on the Inmachuk River 2 km south of Deering. Field investigation revealed only historic trash on or below the surface of this material source, which was partly located in the active floodplain of the river. Since 1981, the Public Archaeology Facility of SUNY- Binghamton under the co-direction of Albert Dekin, Jr., Raymond Newell (Gronigen) and Edwin Hall, Jr. (SUNY-Brockport) has conducted archaeological re- search at the Utqiagvik site in Barrow. In 1982 exca- vations were conducted for the North Slope Borough utility project through Frank Moolin and Associates, Inc. with John Lobedell (Alaska, Anchorage Com- munity College) as project archaeologist. A spectacular find was a catastrophically destroyed house containing five individuals, two of whom were nearly perfectly preserved by freezing, as well as abundant cultural ma- terial. The house and its occupants had been destroyed by coastal ice override some 400 years ago. After con- sultation with the elders of Barrow, the field crew worked around the clock to remove the remains for autopsy. The preserved soft tissues provided a rare opportunity to study members of a precontact population using a battery of modem scientific techniques. Hospital study was coordinated by Wayne Meyers (Alaska, WAMI Medical Education Program). Complete autopsy was performed by Michael Zimmerman (Hahnemann Medical College) and Arthur Aufderheide (Minnesota). A second examination was conducted by Dianna Sil- imperi and Wallace Alward (Center for Disease Con- trol). Specialized studies were conducted by nine in- vestigators. Both of the well-preserved adult females from this house suffered from osteoporosis and anthracosis. The older of the two had had pneumonia, chronic bronchial conditions and, probably, trichinosis. Presence of mul- tiple Harris lines in the long bones of the site occupants suggests to John Lobdell seasonal stress, probably mal- nutrition. Indicative of the quality of preservation of cultural material in the house was recovery of four buckets with their contents intact. This discovery, which received wide media attention, was the topic of a day- long multidisciplinary symposium at the Annual Meet- ing of the Alaska Anthropological Association in March 1983. Papers from this symposium will soon be pub- lished in Arctic Anthropology. B. Craig Gerlach (Brown) directed a crew of six in continuing excavations at the Croxton site, Tukuto Lake in the arctic foothills. This work was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Arctic Institute of North America and the Firestone Foundation, with logistic support from the Bureau of Land Management. About 88 additional units (ca. 1.22 x 1.22 m) were excavated in the main site area (J) and 10 squares were dug in Area L. Block excavations started in 1981 were completed and the boundaries of several additional activity areas were defined. In addition, a 15% non- systematic sample was also completed. The presence of three components (Arctic Small Tool tradition, Ipiutak-related, and prehistoric Inupiat) was confirmed in Area J. Twenty-seven radiocarbon dates indicate that the Arctic Small Tool tradition occupa- tion dates between 2470 and 1300 B.C. while the late prehistoric Eskimo component dates between ca. A.D. 700 and 1300. The Ipiutak-related component remains to be dated. Some 2,500 stone artifacts in addition to antler, bone, wood and bark artifacts have been re- covered. Microblades are associated with the oldest occupation. About 99% of the 90-135 kg faunal sample is caribou, but musk oxen, Dall sheep, bear, dog, small mammals, ducks and geese are also present. Data on caribou seasonality suggest that at least one occupation took place between late spring and late fall. Features include several hearths, concentrations of burned rock 422 [Vol. 49, No. 2, 1984]</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH and small basin-shaped pits. Of particular interest was an elliptical area of cultural material defined by well- preserved wooden pegs standing upright in ancient ground. Since house pits have not been identified at the site, dwellings were probably temporary construc- tions of willow frames with caribou skin coverings. This interpretation is supported by the identification of cut sod blocks arranged in an orderly fashion across several occupation surfaces. Brief test excavations in Area L indicated shallow and unstratified cultural deposits comprised of flaking debris and decomposed bone. Test excavations in 1981 had recovered a hearth area here which yielded side blades, thin well-fired check-stamped potsherds with organic temper, and caribou bones. Two radiocarbon dates from this earlier test yielded unacceptable (i.e., modem) results. INTERIOR ALASKA. Wendy Arundale (Alaska, Fairbanks) with support from the Doyon Regional Na- tive Corporation and the Alaska State Office of History and Archaeology undertook both oral history and ar- chaeological surveys in the Holy Cross-Anvik-Shage- luk-Grayling area in western interior Alaska. In early September, a few hours were spent mapping 20 struc- tures at Dishkaket, a former native community on the upper Innoko River which served as a transfer point for freight in the early twentieth century. A search was made for a native community which formerly stood at the head of an important portage between the Iditarod and Innoko rivers, but it appears to have been de- stroyed by river action. Ten days were spent in a boat survey of the lower Innoko River, during which two single graves, a small pit house site, three small historic village sites and one medium and one large historic village that may have prehistoric components were lo- cated. The large village, which contains over 40 semi- subterranean houses and two communal houses (kash- ims), appears to represent a previously undocumented major population center. Charles Mobley (AHRG), under contract from the Department of Transportation, conducted a survey of airport property at Shageluk on the Innoko River which located several historic burials with surface markers and 13 large depressions three to six meters in diam- eter. Known locally as "igloo houses," these features are probably house pits relating to the prehistory or an early period in the history of Old Shageluk. An archaeological survey of the Coleen River in northeastern Alaska was supported by a University of Alaska Museum Geist Fund grant and the Cooperative Parks Study Unit of the National Park Service. The project was carried out by Mark Standley and Robert Betts (Alaska, Fairbanks) during July and August. The area between the southern foothills of the Brooks Range and the confluence of the Coleen and Porcupine rivers was surveyed by boat and foot. Fourteen sites were recorded and tested, all near the main Coleen River drainage. On the basis of artifact typology, sites range from the American Paleoarctic tradition to the contact period, although no diagnostic Northern Archaic tra- dition artifacts were recovered. A piece of worked walrus ivory and an antler drum handle in a contact period site on the upper Coleen River suggest an Eskimo presence south of the Brooks Range and provide evidence for Eskimo-Indian con- tacts in this area. This supports the idea that the Coleen and Firth river drainages functioned as a travel route from Herschel Island in the Beaufort Sea to the Alaskan interior. Most of the sites consisted of surface and sub- surface lithic scatters, but four circular stone structures were found which, on the basis of ethnographic evi- dence, are interpreted as the remains of meat caches. Charles Mobley (AHRG) conducted test excavations at an Alaska Department of Transportation gravel source at the village of Chalkyitsik on the Black River in northeastern Alaska. The Marten Hill site (BLR- 038) was discovered in 1981 and yielded surface ar- tifacts including two large side-notched projectile points. Test excavations to determine the site limits in 1982 produced microblades, adding another site to the grow- ing roster of those which contain both microblades and notched projectile points. Richard Stern and Douglas Gibson (ADGGS) sur- veyed three material sources along the Steese Highway between Central and Circle. At Jump-Off Creek (M.S. 670-040-2) remains of extinct bison and horse were found on the talus spoil of an existing gravel operation. Follow-up investigations by the University of Alaska Museum did not recover any more paleontological ma- terial. At the Central Airport, remains of an historic cabin and a portable sawmill were found. A third ma- terial source near Central yielded only recent trash, as did a survey along the route of the Murphy Dome Road extension northwest of Fairbanks. Georgeanne Reynolds (NPS) conducted a river survey in the Yukon-Charley National Preserve. A three-person crew floated the Charlie River from its confluence with Copper Creek to the Yukon River, finding one lithic scatter. Two three-person crews sur- veyed along the Yukon River from Calico to Takoma Bluffs, finding 20 sites. The most important of these was Calico Ridge, a 600 x 10 m area where lithic ma- terial was found to a depth of 35 cm below ground surface. While no diagnostic artifacts were found here, the investigators believe that some of this material resembles the Paleoarctic tradition Akmak complex. A Stott point thought to postdate slightly deposition of the White River volcanic ash 1,600 to 1,800 years ago was found near the mouth of the Tatonduk River. Other finds include worked obsidian and quartz crystal associated with chert debris near Mantauk Bluff and trade beads found near the Tatonduk River and near Chester Bluff. House depressions across from the mouth of the Kandik River on the Yukon River may represent an outlier of Charley's Village, a Han Indian settlement thought to have been washed away by the Yukon River in 1913. Peter Phippen (Alaska, Fairbanks) with support from the University of Alaska Museum and the National Park Service tested the multicomponent FAI-091 site located on a terrace of the Teklanika River north of the Alaska Range. Three components are present in a stratified sand and silt matrix. The oldest, represented by a small assemblage which includes bifacially chipped implements, microblades, and utilized flakes as well as abundant waste flakes, may have affinities with the Denali complex. It has been dated to 9060 ? 410 ra- 423</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY diocarbon years (Beta-5416). Component II, separated from Component I by more than 15 cm of sterile sand, is a complex feature consisting of nine boulders each ca. 30 cm in diameter oriented north-south in a rela- tively straight line covering five meters. A possible hearth is associated with this feature, which may be part of a structure. Component II was dated in 1977 to 9325 ? 305 radiocarbon years (GX-6283) and in 1982 to 8130 ? 140 radiocarbon years (laboratory number not available in source utilized). Component III consists only of an undated possible hammerstone. Douglas Reger and R. Greg Dixon (ADGGS) sur- veyed the north shore of Tazlina Lake in the Copper River Basin. Twelve sites consisting of cache or house pit features were found. Three of the sites are house pit villages. A single house pit site was tested. Although no artifacts were recovered, bones of hare, salmonids, grouse or ptarmigan, and caribou or mountain sheep were collected from the hearth area in the center of the depression. Finally, a second season of survey directed by Charles Mobley (AHRG) completed the archaeological inven- tory of the Willow-to-Healy Electric Transmission In- tertie Corridor in central Alaska for the Alaska Power Authority. This north-south trending corridor provides a transect across the Alaska Range, sampling several environments. Four historic and over one dozen pre- historic surface sites were found in 1981 and 1982. Prehistoric sites include some with microblade tech- nology as well as sites with side-notched projectile points. The same investigator conducted archaeological work as part of a cultural resource assessment of the lower Susitna River basin (Beluga Study Area) for the Soil Conservation Service. It was possible to obtain aerial verification of several historic sites known from doc- umentary sources. The project also discovered and re- corded three prehistoric sites on the Talachulitna drainage. These sites consisted of from six to 47 surface depressions, each ranging from approximately 0.50 m to 5 m in diameter and extending downward to a depth of 1.5 m. Some of these features are square while others are circular. They probably are cache and habitation structures and they may reflect protohistoric Tanaina Athapaskan settlement. INTERIOR NORTHERN CANADA. With sup- port from the Donner Canadian Foundation a Uni- versity of Toronto crew of five directed by William Irving returned to the Old Crow area in the northern Yukon to test previous claims for artifacts of great age in the area. Irving reports that his group, which in- cluded the geologist/geomorphologist A. V. Jopling and the paleontologist B. F. Beebe, has confirmed earlier findings which showed that humans occupied the in- terior northern Yukon at the beginning of the Sanga- mon interglacial about 150,000 years ago. In 1982 they excavated additional artifacts from deposits that have lain essentially undisturbed since they were deposited after a cold period which the Toronto group correlates with the Illinoian glaciation. They also excavated ar- tifacts from a more recent deposit correlated with the early Wisconsin glaciation about 50,000 to 70,000 years ago. Work was concentrated at OCR Loc 12 (MjVi- 10), with extensive excavations carried out along 220 m of exposed bluff here. Attention was focused on the interface between Units 1B and 2, where well over 100 linear meters of uninterrupted erosion face was ex- posed and from which a significant number of bone artifacts were recovered. More limited work in the up- per zone of Unit 2 also produced artifacts. Irving notes that, while doubt had been expressed by some scientists about the dating and authenticity of the artifacts, the Toronto group believes that the 1982 work leaves no room for further doubt. Cathy D'Andrea and Ruth Gotthardt (Toronto) re- port that in October of 1982 the remains of five horses killed and/or scavenged by wolves were collected from the Ross River area, Yukon Territory. Since all died within the past two years it can be assumed that mod- ification and postmortem disturbance of the horse skel- etal remains are primarily the result of carnivore ac- tivity, including that of wolves, dogs, bears and the red fox. The objective of the study was to characterize carnivore modification in terms of bone alteration, preference for certain elements or portions and patterns of survivorship of elements at recent kill sites. These observations are expected to be important for inter- preting patterns in the fossil record. The most common types of carnivore modification observed were tooth furrows, punctures and curvilin- ear fractures, primarily on smaller elements such as ribs. There were a few occurrences of scoring, chipping back and rounding of the fractured edges. Survival of elements at kill sites depends upon the degree of carcass utilization by carnivores. Cranial and axial elements and ribs, in various stages of fragmentation, were pres- ent at all sites. Scapulae, innominates and limbs were generally widely scattered or absent at well-utilized sites. On the basis of this small sample the investigators observed that most bone modification by carnivores is distinctive and consistently patterned. The few oc- currences of flaking, polish and curvilinear fracture not associated with definite evidence of gnawing are types of carnivore modifications deserving of closer atten- tion, particularly in view of the degree of overlap with some forms of human alteration on bone postulated for collections of Pleistocene age. Comparison of mod- ifications observed on the bones of these large ungu- lates to Proboscidean bone, however, should be made cautiously, if at all. Jeff Hunston (Council for Yukon Indians) initiated an inventory of archaeological sites and collections in the Whitehorse area. The Riverdale North site on a glacio-fluvial knoll overlooking the Riverdale subdi- vision of Whitehorse is the most significant site en- countered. This late prehistoric site yielded a distinc- tive triangular native copper arrow point, dentalia, what appear to be two types of obsidian (probably from the Mount Edziza and Airdrop Lake sources), other non- local lithic material, faunal remains and debitage in- dicative of biface manufacture. Several sites were en- countered by D. Davidge (Environmental Protection Service) along the Yukon River. Pre-White River ash occupations with much faunal material, debitage and a notched point characterize the collections from two deeply buried sites downstream from Whitehorse. Sheila Greer (Toronto) completed site survey and 424 [Vol. 49, No. 2, 1984]</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEARCH excavations in the Whitehorse and Carcross areas of the southern Yukon in 1982. The work was sponsored by the Archaeological Survey of Canada and the Re- source Planning Office of the Yukon Territorial Gov- ernment with additional support from the University of Toronto and the Arctic Institute of North America. Information recovered is being used in a regional study of late prehistoric (post-White River ash-i.e., post- dating A.D. 700) land use patterns. These archaeolog- ical data will be compared with ethnographic infor- mation on Tagish Athapaskan land use patterns. Twenty-eight new sites were recorded by the survey. Most of these are small lithic scatters on the surface or shallowly buried. A few are multi-component, with lithic debris found both above and beneath the White River ash. The Luu Cho site (JbUm- 1) on Little Atlin Lake may be the most significant of these, as it is strat- ified with two components above the White River ash and at least one component beneath. Tabular spall scraper fragments, a pebble core, fragments of worked bone, a shell bead, lithic detritus and quantities of fau- nal remains were collected at Luu Cho. Seventeen and one half square meters were exca- vated at the Annie Lake site (JcUr-3), situated in the coast mountains. The site is multi-component, with a small post-ash occupation and a number of pre-ash components. A major occupation of the site, repre- sented by quantities of lithic detritus, was found just below the ash layer. Different matLrials were recovered below this component. These include small lanceolate points with deeply concave (although unfluted) bases and, in the deepest part of the site deposits, micro- blades. The site is interpreted as a hunting base camp. Twelve square meters were excavated at the Des- quanga site (JcVj-12) on Squanga Lake on the Yukon plateau. Though stratified, with both pre-ash and post- ash remains, this site was most heavily utilized in late prehistoric times. Seven small notched points, bone tool fragments, retouched flakes, lithic waste, mammal and bird faunal debris were recovered above the ash layer. This site may have been a family base camp. In 1982 an Archaeology Program was established at the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre in Yel- lowknife with responsibility for administration of ar- chaeological regulations and cultural resource man- agement in the Northwest Territories. Several hundred development proposals were reviewed for possible im- pacts on archaeological sites. In addition, staff archae- ologists undertook several research projects. One of these was a survey by Chris Hanks of historic cabins and ancillary settlement areas along a 200-km stretch of the Mackenzie River. The project obtained infor- mation on settlement patterns associated with a rapidly changing way of life, and complements an oral history project. Jean-Luc Pilon (Toronto) directed a crew of five sup- plemented by local high school students provided by the Fort Severn Band Council in excavations at nine late prehistoric and early historic sites along the lower Severn River in the Hudson Bay lowlands. The main goals of this work were assessment of adaptations over time to this unique environment and evaluation of the impact of European contact on native culture. In eight weeks ca. 126 m2 of deposits were excavated. Four sites were multi-component and four exceeded 30 cm in depth. Occupational levels were encountered in perma- frost at some sites. The sites represent a broad temporal span and yielded a diverse spectrum of artifacts. Eight of the nine sites contained well preserved faunal re- mains, which are particularly valuable given the re- search emphasis. Preliminary analysis indicates that both the late prehistoric and early historic occupants of the area made use of a broad range of warm season faunal resources such as caribou, beaver, porcupine, migratory waterfowl and fish. Fall caribou hunting sites have also been located. Beginning in the nineteenth century, there was a shift to greater utilization of small mammals (hare, muskrat), fish and waterfowl. Occu- pations during this time may have extended into the cold season. Local chert cobbles were used in tool manufacture in late prehistoric times, but stone tools probably were not as important as organic artifacts. While early Eu- ropean trade items were acquired as functional imple- ments, they also seem to have served (at least during the early contact period) as important sources of raw material which could be integrated into existing tech- nological traditions. Ceramics are not found in either late prehistoric or historic sites in the coastal lowlands. CANADIAN ARCTIC. The Northern Cultural Heritage Project continued excavations on Paleoeski- mo sites at the west end of Stanwell-Fletcher Lake, Somerset Island, N.W.T. under the direction of Ellen Bielawski (Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre). The field crew, which included nine students from Northwest Territories communities, excavated six ear- ly Arctic Small Tool tradition habitation features at PeJv-3, a small site with a total of 13 features. This excavation yielded the first evidence from this area of Independence I cultural characteristics such as well- defined stone mid-passages associated with dwellings and slight edge serration of thin tapered-stemmed points. This excavation provides material for com- parison with data collected since 1979 at the much larger PfJv-2 site located 3 km from PeJv-3. PfJv-2 is a complex site which has yielded remains ranging from the early Arctic Small Tool tradition to recent Inuit (Eskimo). A late Dorset component there represents an inland Dorset lacustrine occupation, a relatively rare find in the central arctic islands. Excavations continued at two large Thule culture winter settlements on Skraeling Island at the entrance to Alexandra Fiord, eastern Ellesmere Island. This work was directed by Peter Schledermann (Arctic Institute of North America) with support from that institution, the Firestone Foundation, the University of Toronto, the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, and the Polar Continental Shelf project. House style and re- covered artifacts relate these two sites to the Ruin Is- land phase of Thule culture, dated from ca. A.D. 1150 to 1350. Activities at the Skraeling Island site (SfFk-4) on the southwestern coast of the island involved testing of middens outside a number of dwellings and the total excavation of a multi-roomed Thule winter house (House 7). Midden excavations were concentrated near three single-family dwellings attached to a festive or 425</page><page sequence="11">426 communal structure. Although little was found outside of the single-family dwellings, there were three discrete midden concentrations along the north, south and east walls of the festival house. The midden areas adjacent to the east and south walls appear to have been inten- tionally constructed pits (possibly underground meat caches) before they were filled with garbage deposits. The cultural deposit outside the north wall was much shallower, lying upon the original ground surface. Lack of extensive midden around the winter house and ab- sence of evidence for multiple house occupation sug- gest a relatively brief occupation of the site. House 7 was a typical Ruin Island dwelling consisting of a main room (3 m2) with a sleeping compartment extension on the east side, a separate kitchen offshoot adjacent to the tunnel entrance passage, and a small rectangular stone-lined meat pit near the kitchen entrance. Work on the Sverdrup site (SfFk-5) on the north coast of Skraeling Island was focused on three Thule culture winter house ruins and investigation of the large [Vol. 49, No. 2, 1984] meat cache features prevalent at this site. All three house ruins yielded cultural material similar to that from SfFk-4. The inventory of Norse artifacts from Skraeling Island was increased with the addition of a circular bone gaming piece or "draughtsman" similar to a piece known from the Ruin Island site in north- western Greenland. Large oval to sub-rectangular meat caches measuring 2.5 by 1.5 m were found near the winter dwellings. These pits contained numerous bow- head whale, seal, and walrus bones as well as stone tools and debitage, a Thule Type 2 harpoon head, a soapstone vessel fragment and bone handles. Schledermann also completed ground survey of the Johan Peninsula from Alexandra Fiord to Pim Island. Arctic Small Tool tradition features encountered num- bered 260 while over 1,082 Thule culture summer camp features were recorded. William B. Workman AMERICAN ANTIQUITY</page></plain_text>
