Although coal is common in archaeological assemblages from the Gulf of Alaska, few researchers have con- sidered the distribution or origins of archaeological coal. This paper describes the coal artifact assemblages from the Uyak site and Old Karluk, examines the distribution of coal artifacts in Kachemak tradition sites, and presents information on possible source areas for this coal. Vitrinite reflectance testing suggests that coal artifacts from the Uyak site and Old Karluk were not manufactured from locally available lignite, but from a high rank coal available on the Alaskan mainland. In combination, the frequency, use, and distribution of coal and other nonlocal materials in Kachemak sites suggests that interregional exchange and interaction were extensive during the Kachemak tradition. Coal artifacts are found in many archaeological sites in the Gulf of Alaska. Although they are a par- ticular hallmark of Kachemak tradition assem- blages from the central Gulf (D. Clark 1974a: 131; Jordan and Knecht 1988:271), coal artifacts occur in sites from British Columbia (Fladmark 1986:74) to the Aleutian Islands (McCartney 1984:135) and in deposits dating from early cultural occupations (G. Clark 1977:16) to the historic period (Knecht and Jordan 1985:29). Despite the repeated occur- rence of coal in archaeological contexts, few re- searchers have examined the production and distri- bution of coal artifacts or investigated the source of archaeologically occurring coals.1 On Kodiak, ar- chaeologists studying Kachemak tradition assem- blages have assumed that coal artifacts were made from locally available low rank2 coal, specifically lignite (Heizer 1956:53; Donta 1988:73; Crozier 1989:93), or have noted the presence of "coal" or "jet" artifacts without reference to the char- acter or origin of the material (Hrdlicka 1944; D. Clark 1974a; Nowak 1978; Jordan and Knecht 1988). During recent excavations at the Uyak site and Old Karluk, Late Kachemak villages on Kodiak Island, an unprecedented number of coal artifacts were recovered. Coal artifact assemblages from these sites include debitage, artifact preforms, and finished pieces reflecting all stages of coal artifact production. The data indicate that coal artifacts, specifically items for personal adornment, were manufactured from chunks of raw coal at these two sites. Furthermore, analysis of coal debitage from the Uyak site and Old Karluk, demonstrates that the archaeological coal is not the locally available lig- nite, but a high rank coal not available on Kodiak Island. The results of vitrinite reflectance testing, presented below, suggest the archaeological coal Amy F.

In broad terms, the distribution of coal and other nonlocal materials in Kodiak Island sites pro- vides clues to settlement patterns and site func- tions. In the Uyak Bay and Karluk River areas, coal artifact production is found in large prominently located village sites, but not in smaller, less perma- nently occupied sites. It appears that coal artifact production occurred in villages that functioned as major base camps and were the focus of at least semipermanent occupation. This pattern of coal artifact recovery is distinct. In other Kachemak sites on Kodiak Island and in Cook Inlet, archae- ologists have found small numbers of finished coal objects but no coal preforms or debitage. The regional distribution of coal artifacts and evidence of production suggests that coal artifacts were man-</page><page sequence="3">Steffian: Archaeological Coal 113 ufactured in sites along the coast of Shelikof Strait and traded to adjacent regions. Finally, the fre- quency, use, and distribution of coal and other non- local materials in Kachemak sites suggests that interregional exchange and interaction were exten- sive during the Kachemak tradition. On south- western Kodiak, Late Kachemak economy cannot be discussed without reference to the Alaskan mainland. The Uyak Site (KOD-145) The Uyak site is located in the modern village of Larsen Bay, on the southwestern coast of Kodiak Island (Fig. 1). Cultural materials are deposited on and adjacent to a rocky point at the entrance to Larsen Bay. This point, and gently sloping beaches on either side, overlook larger Uyak Bay. To the east of the point, a freshwater stream runs through the site and empties into Uyak Bay. On a clear day, the Alaska Peninsula is visible to the northwest, some 45 km across Shelikof Strait. The Uyak site is large, once covering more than 3.24 ha (Hrdlicka 1944: 141). Today, cultural deposits run 300 m along the shore and in places extend more than 80 m inland (Fig. 2). Archaeological investigation of the Uyak site began in 1931, when physical anthropologist Ales Hrdlicka excavated the western area of the site. For four seasons, under the auspices of the U.S. Na- tional Museum, Hrdlicka shoveled through meters of prehistoric midden. His work focused on the point where dense vegetation, deep surface depres- sions, and eroding deposits led him to the body of the site. Hrdlicka 's primary goal was to collect human skeletal material to study population move- ments in the New World. His field methods re- flected this intent. Although Hrdlicka assigned specimens to the upper, middle, and lower levels of the site to reflect what he felt were discrete cultural levels, he did not systematically collect artifacts or faunal material, or keep records of the site's many features. The result was a highly selective collec- tion of material with little provenience information from one of the largest excavations in Alaska. In 1985, the Kodiak Archaeological Project demonstrated that there was an intact area of the Uyak site adjacent to Hrdlicka 's area of excavation (Crowell 1986). To begin interpreting this large site, and to make sense of Hrdlicka 's collections, a new excavation was conducted during the summers of 1987 and 1988. The goal of this project was to study Kachemak social and economic organization at the village level through broad horizontal excavation. Two large blocks of contiguous excavation units were dug in the eastern area of the site (Fig. 2). The results of this excavation are presented in another paper (Steffian 1992). Briefly, over 4400 artifacts were recovered and 16 structures were identified from an estimated 400 m3 of excavation. The exca- vation revealed a cluster of single-roomed houses, storage structures, burials, and other features which are roughly contemporaneous. The history of site formation as preserved in the site's stratigra- phy, an analysis of the artifact assemblage, and the results of radiocarbon dating indicate the eastern area of the site was a part of a sizeable Kachemak village, occupied at least semipermanently over several hundred years. The one-sigma range of five uncorrected radiocarbon dates on charcoal and wood samples from site house floors place this occupation between 1050 and 1390 b.p. In the Uyak Bay region, 35 Kachemak sites have been identified (Nowak 1978; Crowell 1986; Jordan and Knecht 1988; Steffian 1992). The Uyak site is one of at least five large sites.3 In Uyak Bay, large sites tend to occur at the entrance to smaller bays in locations with an unobscured view of Uyak Bay. These sites provided the best access to marine mammals. In contrast, smaller sites tend to appear along inner bays, particularly at the mouths of salmon streams. Although issues of settlement sea- sonality are unresolved, it is likely that larger vil- lage sites, like the Uyak site, were places of winter population aggregation and that smaller sites reflect seasonal procurement of salmon and other resources. Whatever the case, the location, size, structure, and artifact assemblage from the Uyak site suggest that this village was occupied for a large portion of the annual cycle. Old Karluk (KAR-031) The Old Karluk site is located at the mouth of the Karluk River, on the southwestern coast of Kodiak Island, approximately 24 km southwest of the Uyak site (Fig. 1). The site is in the northwest corner of Karluk Lagoon, across the river from the modern village of Karluk. At Old Karluk, a continuous sequence of cultural materials dating from the Ocean Bay tradition to the present is deposited along the riverbank for a distance of roughly 5 km (Fig. 3). In places, cultural deposits are more than 4 m deep. The site includes the remains of a Rus- sian artel, established by Shelikof in 1785 as a provisioning post (Jordan and Knecht 1988:236- 237). Earth moving related to construction of the artel has disturbed the upper prehistoric levels of the site. Severe erosion has also contributed to site destruction. The beach front at Old Karluk is lit- tered with historic and prehistoric artifacts. Old Karluk was first investigated in 1952 by Frederick Milan, who excavated four shallow test pits and recovered a few late prehistoric artifacts (Clark 1974b:81-85). A detailed investigation of the site was not conducted until the summers of 1984 and 1985. The results of this excavation are de- scribed in Jordan and Knecht (1988). Briefly, work-</page><page sequence="4">ÎÏ4 Arctic Anthropology 29:2 Figure 2. Plan view of the Uyak site (from Steffian 1992).</page><page sequence="5">Steff ian: Archaeological Coal 115 Figure 3. Location of Old Karluk (adapted from Jordan and Knecht 1988). ing from the erosion face into the body of the site, Jordan and his crew excavated over 133 m3 of cul- tural deposits. Although the upper levels of the site were disturbed by historic and modern occupa- tions, Jordan discovered intact Kachemak and Ocean Bay tradition deposits and recovered more than 8500 artifacts. An unconnected radiocarbon date on a wooden plank from a fragmentary house floor in Level 7 places the Kachemak occupation at 980 ±60 B.p. (Jordan and Knecht 1988:239). Accord- ing to Jordan and Knecht (1988:241-242), midden deposits and another fragmentary house floor (Lev- els 5 and 6) also contain Late Kachemak materials. These deposits are roughly contemporary with Kachemak deposits at the Uyak site. Old Karluk is one of 24 Kachemak village sites in the Karluk River area. As in Uyak Bay, issues of settlement seasonality and permanence are unre- solved. Large and small villages, interspersed along the river bank and lake shore were located to take advantage of the river's tremendous salmon resources. Jordan (personal communication, 1990) suspected that the large village at Old Karluk was permanently occupied during the Kachemak period. However, the Karluk River area is easily accessible from Uyak Bay. Kachemak tradition peo- ple living in Uyak Bay probably took advantage of highly predictable salmon runs in the Karluk River, moving seasonally between the two regions. Al- though it is possible that Kachemak period people lived in the Karluk River drainage throughout the year, some sites may reflect repeated seasonal use. Ongoing analysis of artifact and faunal collections will provide additional information with which to address this question. Coal Artifacts from the Uyak Site and Old Karluk Although subsistence activities at the Uyak and Old Karluk sites differed, the artifact assemblages from both localities indicate a wide range of productive activities. Coal is one of many classes of material worked from raw material to finished object at both sites (Jordan and Knecht 1988; Steffian 1992). A</page><page sequence="6">116 Arctic Anthropology 29:2 Table 1. Coal Artifacts from the Uyak Site and Old Karluk Uyak Site (KOD-145) total of 303 coal artifacts were recovered from the Uyak site, 6.89% of the total assemblage of 4400 artifacts. There are considerably fewer coal artifacts from Old Karluk: 24 of 3714 artifacts, or 0.64% of the Late Kachemak assemblage. In part, this pattern reflects differences in overall artifact density. At Old Karluk 116 artifacts were recovered per cubic meter in the Late Kachemak levels (levels 5, 6, and 7), whereas in the eastern areas of the Uyak site only 11 artifacts were recovered per cubic meter. This great difference in artifact density is inflated by the prevalence of net sinkers at Old Karluk. Jordan col- lected more than 1200 net sinkers, comprising one- third of the Kachemak assemblage. In contrast we found only three net sinkers at the Uyak site. Con- trolling for the overabundance of sinkers decreases artifact density to 78 objects per cubic meter and increases the percentage of coal artifacts to .95%, but it does not entirely account for the difference in artifact density. Despite this difference in artifact density, the coal assemblages from the two sites are similar. Both contain finished coal artifacts, preform pieces, and coal debitage (Table 1). Seven classes of coal artifacts were identified, including labrets, labret preforms, beads and pendants, bead and pen- dant preforms, nose pins, unclassifiable objects, and debitage.4 All of the identifiable objects and preforms represent pieces used for personal adorn- ment. In both collections, labrets are the most com- mon finished object, comprising 24% of coal arti- facts at the Uyak site (Fig. 4) and 29% of coal artifacts in the Kachemak levels at Old Karluk. Beads and pendants are present in both assem- blages, although in smaller numbers. Nose pins were found only at Old Karluk. Debitage, including raw material chunks, is the most common class of coal artifact in both assemblages. In the Uyak assemblage debitage comprises more than 50% of the coal artifacts. Sim- ilarly, at Old Karluk debitage accounts for 41% of all archaeological coal. At both sites, coal was worked as if it were a cryptocry stalline stone. Chunks of coal were reduced and shaped by flak- ing. Flakes of coal exhibiting a striking platform and bulb of percussion, as well as chunks of mate- rial with multiple flake scars document this pro- cess. "Flakes" of coal are also reported by G. Clark (1977:16-18) and by Nowak (1978:Plate 7m) in assemblages from the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak. Similarly, Workman and Workman (1990:274) note the presence of flake scars on a chunk of worked coal from an undated site on the Pacific coast of the Alaska Peninsula. Several pieces of coal debitage from the Uyak site also show grooving.

Coal labrets from the Uyak site (from Steffian 1992). section of raw material, then the isolated chunk was removed by percussion. The resulting piece is roughly the size and shape of large oval labrets in the Uyak assemblage. After chipping, coal objects were ground to shape and polished to a shine. Sandstone and pumice abraders are common objects in both assemblages (Jordan and Knecht 1988:242) and may have been used in the final stages of coal object production. Although coal debitage was found at both the Uyak site and Old Karluk, the character of debitage from the two assemblages differs. To measure debitage size, I used a template of graduated circles (0.5 cm increments). At the Uyak site, debitage occurs in a wide range of sizes. Although pieces 2.5 to 3.5 cm are the most common, debitage ranges from 1.0 to 9.0 cm and is bimodally distributed, with modes at 3.0 cm and 6.0 cm. In contrast, at Old Karluk, debitage size ranges from 1.5 to 4.0 cm and is unimodally distributed around 2.5 cm. Raw material chunks and debitage representing the early stages of coal artifact production are absent in the Old Karluk assemblage. This pattern may re- flect the small size of the Old Karluk assemblage. Coal artifacts from the Uyak site were recovered from 400 m3 of excavation, whereas those from Old Karluk were recovered from a 32 m3 area. Alter- natively, it may reflect careful curation and reuse of larger debitage pieces, acquisition of coal through an exchange network, or exchange of reduced chunks or preform pieces. Another major difference between the Uyak and Old Karluk assemblages is the occurrence of preforms. Labret and bead preforms, which make up 21.5% of the coal artifacts from the Uyak site, account for only 8% of the Old Karluk assemblage. It is unlikely that the low percentage of preforms reflects a different method of artifact manufacture, although as suggested above, it may indicate raw material curation and/or acquisition of raw material or artifact preforms through exchange. Whatever the case, the small size of debitage, the small number of preforms, and the lower density of coal artifacts at Old Karluk suggest that while coal arti- fact production occurred it never equaled that of the Uyak site. Distribution of Coal Artifacts in the Central Gulf of Alaska The coal artifact inventories from the Uyak and Old Karluk sites differ from those identified at other contemporary sites in the Gulf of Alaska. Accord- ing to published information, coal artifacts occur in many Kachemak sites as a small number of finished pieces (Table 2). In the Uyak Bay and Karluk areas, archaeological data suggest that coal artifacts were produced in large villages and not in smaller sea- sonal camps. At the regional level, the available evidence suggests that coal artifacts were produced in sites along the shores of Shelikof Strait and traded in small numbers to other areas. Although the sample of excavated sites in the Uyak Bay and Karluk River areas is small, the dis- tribution of coal artifacts appears to reflect local settlement patterns. Coal artifact production is found in large, prominently located village sites, but not in smaller, less conspicuous sites. For example, at KAR-029, a small site at the head of Larsen Bay, Crozier (1989:93) recovered two coal labrets and a coal nose pin from Late Kachemak deposits, but found no evidence of coal artifact pro- duction. This is a completely different pattern of coal artifact recovery than identified at the Uyak site, approximately 6 km to the east.

This could reflect the existence of a settlement hierarchy, with larger, more powerful villages controlling access to certain raw materials. However, given the lack of other archaeological evidence for settlement hierarchy in this period (Steffian 1992), it is more likely that smaller villages represent temporarily occupied, task specific sites where craft production was limited or absent. Crozier (1989:93-94) interprets KAR-029 as a short-term camp, contrasting it with larger, more permanently occupied villages such as the Uyak site and Old Karluk. This idea is supported by anal- ysis of the faunal remains from KAR-029 which suggests the site was a summer camp (Yesner 1989:104). In contrast, larger villages seem to be places of multiseasonal occupation where a wide range of productive activities occurred, including the production of nonutilitarian items. At the Uyak site, the presence of extensive Kachemak midden deposits, numerous semisubterranean houses, stor- age features, and a wide range of productive activi- ties support this idea. Similarly, large midden deposits (Jordan and Knecht 1988:239), the pres- ence of multiple structures, a high density of arti- facts, and evidence of many productive activities are characteristic of Old Karluk, another locus of coal artifact production. Additional evidence of coal artifact produc- tion comes from the Alaska Peninsula. At pre- historic sites on Takli Island and in Dakavak Bay, Kukak Bay, and Kaflia Bay, archaeologists have re- covered coal artifacts, preforms, and debitage (G. Clark 1977:16-18, 159-160; Oswalt 1955:49). As on Kodiak, some of these sites date before and after the Late Kachemak period, indicating that coal artifact production has an antiquity of at least 4000 years. At the Kukak site, deposits assigned to the Beach phase occupation, a.d. 500-1000 (G. Clark 1977:27), are contemporary with Late Kachemak tradition sites on Kodiak. Although only ten coal artifacts were recovered from tests of Beach phase deposits at the Kukak site, they represent the entire range of artifact production (Table 2). Similarly, at the Kaflia site in Kaflia Bay to the south of Kukak Bay, Oswalt recovered five coal arti- facts. The assemblage from the Kaflia site includes a single labret, two object preforms, and two unmodified chunks of coal (Oswalt 1955:49). Despite its small size, the Kaflia assemblage also indicates that coal artifacts were produced at the site. Although this assemblage has not been radi- ocarbon dated, Oswalt (1955:35) suggests on typo- logical grounds that the Kaflia assemblage was con- temporary with Kachemak tradition assemblages from Kachemak Bay. Although the sample of excavated sites in other regions is small, there are no reports of coal debitage from any other Kachemak site on Kodiak.5 At Crag Point, a small village at the entrance to Anton Larsen Bay, Knecht recovered two coal labrets and a coal pendant from 122 m2 of excava- tion but found no evidence of coal artifact produc- tion. Earlier investigations of this site (D. Clark 1970) produced no coal artifacts. At KOD-190, a fish camp at the mouth of Kizhuyak Creek, Righter and Jordan (1980:144) recovered a coal labret while shovel testing. Although they suggest that this site was occupied during the Koniag tradition (Righter and Jordan 1980:150), reconsideration of the site and its assemblage suggests that a substantial Kachemak component exists (D. Clark 1992). I sus- pect that the labret is from these Kachemak depos- its. At Three Saints Bay, a Kachemak village on the east shore of Kodiak, Clark (1970:84) recovered four coal labrets and three coal beads but no coal artifact preforms or debitage. Finally, in a recent excava- tion of the Monashka Bay site, northern Kodiak, Christopher Donta (personal communication, 1991) recovered one coal labret from the site's Kachemak layers. No other coal artifacts or evidence of coal artifact production was found during Donta 's ex- cavation or in earlier investigations of this site by Clark (1974b). In contemporary assemblages from Cook Inlet a similar pattern exists. In Kachemak Bay, de La- guna (1975:111) found four coal labrets in the Great Midden on Yukon Island and one at the Cotton- wood Creek site. In a later excavation of the Cotton- wood Creek site, Workman, Lobdell, and Workman (1980:392) recovered a second coal labret. Lobdell (1980:15) reports one coal labret from the Yukon Island Bluff site, and Boraas and Klein (1992) report a single coal labret from Point West in Hali- but Cove. Similarly, Dumond and Mace (1968:11) report a single coal labret from prehistoric deposits at the Fish Creek site in Knik Arm. None of these researchers found evidence of coal artifact produc- tion in either long-term settlements or seasonally occupied camps. Without further archaeological research and analysis of coal samples, discussed below, it is impossible to determine the origins of these pieces. However, the distribution of coal artifacts suggests that coal labrets were not man- ufactured in Cook Inlet, or northern and eastern Kodiak, but were obtained through contact with people from southwestern Kodiak and the Pacific coast of the Alaska Peninsula. It is possible that coal artifacts moved through the Gulf of Alaska as a result of interregional mar- riage (Workman 1988:14) or warfare. Workman (1988: 12) notes that loot taken in warfare may be indistinguishable from gifts or trade items in an archaeological context. Furthermore, Jordan (1989: 18) suggested that the presence of exotic labrets in late prehistoric assemblages may reflect a practice of taking war captives. However, the widespread and repeated occurrence of coal labrets in Kache-</page><page sequence="10">120 Arctic Anthropology 29:2 Figure 5. Distribution of coal deposits in the Gulf of Alaska (compiled from Merritt and Hawley 1986; and P. D. Rao, personal communication, 1991). mak sites suggests that their distribution does not entirely reflect warfare. Coal labrets occur with such regularity that exchange and intermarriage seem more likely mechanisms for the distribution of these artifacts. Coal in the Gulf of Alaska Coal is a sedimentary rock which forms as deposits of plant material are altered by chemical and phys- ical processes. These processes are known as coal- ification. The plant and mineral content of different coals are referred to as coal type. In contrast, dif- ferences in the depositional forces that cause coal- ification, (e.g. pressure and temperature), are responsible for differences in coal rank (Damberger et al. 1984:8). Rank refers specifically to the extent of coal metamorphosis: a higher rank indicates greater metamorphosis (Rao 1975:33). The major rank divisions of coal from highest to lowest re- spectively are anthracite, bituminous, subbitu- minous, and lignite. Anthracites and bituminous coals are considered high rank coals, while sub- bituminous coals and lignites are considered low rank coals. Within these ranks, subdivisions are used to classify smaller scale variability. For exam- ple, bituminous coals are characterized as high, medium, or low volatile. High volatile bituminous coals have a lower rank than low volatile bitumi- nous coals (Davis 1978:74). As the processes of coalification vary greatly, coal type and rank occur in many different com- binations (Damberger et al. 1984:10). Coal scien- tists have developed a range of tests to classify this variability. Although coal scientists work with sam- ples from a known source, characterizing coals with a knowledge of local geology, it is possible to study coal from an unknown source. From an archaeological point of view, coal artifacts can be tested to specify the rank, composition, and the structure of the raw material. This paper presents a study of coal rank. It provides an introduction to</page><page sequence="11">Steffian: Archaeological Coal 121 vitrinite reflectance testing and summarizes the results of reflectance tests conducted on coal sam- ples from two Late Kachemak sites on Kodiak Island. These results are compared with reflectance values associated with known coal deposits to iden- tify possible source locales. All sourcing studies depend on accurate infor- mation on the location and character of raw mate- rials. For this study I used published data on the distribution and rank of known coal deposits in the Gulf of Alaska. Figure 5 (compiled from Merritt and Hawley 1986) illustrates the distribution of these deposits. According to P. D. Rao of the University of Alaska's Mineral Industry Research Laboratory (personal communication, 1991), many of these source locales are not well studied. Consequently, Figure 5 provides only a general picture of the dis- tribution and rank of Gulf coals. In Alaska, coal resources are divided into provinces based on their geographical location. Each province represents an extensive area contain- ing a number of broadly similar coal-bearing rocks (Merritt and Hawley 1986). The three major coal provinces in the study area are the Gulf of Alaska Province, the Cook Inlet-Susitna Province, and the Alaska Peninsula Province (Fig. 5), which encom- pass seven coal fields and two coal districts. In addition to these extensive deposits, there are a number of coal "occurrences," thin, discontinuous coal outcrops of unknown potential (Merritt and Hawley 1986). All major ranks of coal are found in the Gulf of Alaska region (Table 3). Anthracite is the least com- mon, occurring only in the Bering River Coalfield, some 80 km east of Cordova in the Chugach Range, and the Matanuska Coalfield, 72 km northeast of Anchorage (Alaska Division of Geological and Geo- physical Surveys 1990:5, 12). Both of these fields also contain some bituminous coal. However, the most extensive deposits of bituminous coal occur in three localities on the Alaska Peninsula: the Herendeen Bay Coalfield, the Chignik Coalfield, and the Ugashik District. Coal deposits at Chignik and Herendeen Bay are available at tidewater (Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys 1990:17, 23). A single occurrence of bituminous coal of unknown resource potential is reported in Amalik Bay, a small inlet on the Pacific coast of the Alaska Peninsula (Merritt and Hawley 1986). This locale is directly northwest of Uyak Bay, across Shelikof Strait (Fig. 5). Sources of lower rank coals are also common. Extensive deposits of subbituminous coals occur in four fields in Cook Inlet-Susitna Province: the Beluga Field, the Kenai Field, the Matanuska Field, and the Susitna Field. Coal seams observed and sampled by de Laguna (1975:36) in Kachemak Bay are part of the subbituminous deposits of the Kenai Field. De Laguna reports that people of the Kache- mak tradition used this coal for fuel (1975:Appen- dix II). Merritt and Hawley (1986) record a small deposit of subbituminous coal of unknown poten- tial on Sitkinak Island in the southern Kodiak Archipelago. However, evidence presented below suggests that this is actually a high rank bitumi- nous coal (Rao, personal communication, 1991; Nilsen and Moore 1979:22). Lignite occurs on the Alaska Peninsula, Unga Island, and Kodiak Island. Lignite beds of "mine- able" thickness exist on Unga Island and on the southern Alaska Peninsula to the east of Herendeen Bay in the Unga Island District. Coal deposits in the Kodiak Archipelago occur outside a recognized coal province and are not extensively studied (Mer- ritt and Hawley 1986). Merritt and Hawley (1986) show 15 occurrences of lignite in the Kodiak Archi- pelago, and ten of these are located on the south- eastern coast of Kodiak around Kiliuda Bay, Sit- kalidak Strait, Sitkalidak Island, and the Aliulik Peninsula. Others are reported for Red River, Dry Spruce Bay, and Uyak Bay. The report of coal in Uyak Bay (Merritt and Hawley 1986) is puzzling. Although references to coal deposits in other areas of the Archipelago are common, I have found no other references to the occurrence of coal in Uyak Bay. Although Dall (1896:800) visited Uyak Bay as part of his survey of Alaskan coal resources, he does not report coal in any of the source locales noted by Merritt and Hawley. Moreover, local residents tell me there are no such deposits, and in my archaeological surveys of Uyak Bay I have never seen coal deposits. It may be significant that all reported lignite occurrences in Uyak Bay coincide with the location of Late Kachemak sites. In fact, the Map of Alaska's Coal Resources (Merritt and Hawley 1986) shows that lignite occurs at the exact location of the Uyak site. Although I have not been able to substantiate this idea, coal eroded from archaeological sites may have been mistaken for evidence of naturally occur- ring coal. This is particularly plausible in Larsen Bay, given Hrdlicka's method of excavation (Hrdlicka 1944). Additional research is needed to answer this question. Vitrinite Reflectance Testing In North America, coals are commonly ranked by tests of volatile matter content, percent carbon, or heating value (Rao 1975:33). Although reflectance tests are less commonly used to rank coals, results of these tests correlate well with the results of stan- dard ranking tests and can be used to characterize all classes of coal (Damberger et al. 1984:8). Ac- cording to Davis (1978:42), "reflectance is regarded by many as perhaps the best single parameter of coal rank."</page><page sequence="12">122 Arctic Anthropology 29:2 cd M C/3 CO &lt; o «4-1 o CD -S co 13 o j2 U o ° w ctì7 5 g T3 S S (g « W LL e5 o I il i I I il I I i « i I II I I I i i i n r- i &lt;° 00 vo in o &lt;o x$ °&gt; S ??,,,,», ~ 9 ^ » 10 » » d • o S OC o O 1- DC X "g OS i o ê o&gt; o o&gt; 2 -g o 5 S S S&gt; s 1 I § &amp; ^11 5 2 S I s 1 I § I 1 II 1=1 1 » ssoo-s| | g co co co co sag ||s|? ä S § §• ooOEEöE-5 "5O § ■5, "S, i 5, S S -S io ^ "e "e e "e "e x: "e i "e ? __x-x_çû_=jco_coxa)-j jjjjjijfflj - - ni o H 2 o ?

Reflectance tests measure the extent to which light reflects off the surface of vitrinite macérais in a polished coal sample (Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys 1990:36). Higher reflectance values are indicative of higher rank coals. Anthracites have the highest reflectance rates (greater than 1.8%), followed by bituminous coal (0.5 to 1.8%), subbituminous coal (0.3 to 0.4%), and lignite (0.2 to 0.3%) (Given 1984:77). These ranges represent a general sum- mary of the relationship between reflectance and rank, and the range of values associated with differ- ent rank coals may overlap slightly. Despite this overlap, reflectance values provide a standard to which any coal sample can be compared. Vitrinite reflectance testing is well suited for characterizing archaeological coals. In contrast to volatile matter and heating value studies, sample preparation and analysis do not involve complete destruction of an artifact, testing requires only a small amount of material (Davis 1978:28), and with access to the appropriate equipment reflectance tests are easily performed. Furthermore, sample weathering does not significantly alter reflectance values (Stach et al. 1982:199). Rank determinations based on measurements of maximum vitrinite reflectance of weathered coals are equivalent to those of unweathered coals (Stach et al. 1982:202). This is not true for characterizations of volatile mat- ter content, which are significantly altered by weathering (Davis 1978:27). This is an important consideration for archaeological coal samples, as depositional contexts can result in substantial artifact weathering. Methods Nine pieces of coal debitage were selected for vitrinite reflectance testing, seven from the Uyak site and two from Old Karluk. Finished objects and preforms were not tested due to the partially de- structive nature of sample preparation. Debitage samples from the Uyak site were chosen from both the northeastern and southwestern excavation blocks (Fig. 2) and represent a range of horizontal and vertical proveniences. Three of the specimens were found on house floors. The others were recovered from humus and collapsed roof layers (Table 3). The coal specimens from Old Karluk are from Level 7, a Late Kachemak midden deposit roughly contemporary with the Kachemak occupa- tion of the Uyak site (Jordan and Knecht 1988:239). The two specimens were found together in a small cluster of coal debitage. These archaeological coal samples were pre- pared and examined at the Mineral Industry Re- search Laboratory (M.I.R.L.) of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, under the direction of P. D. Rao. Samples of coal from a geological deposit are usually crushed and mounted to make a briquet (Davis 1978:55). For this analysis, we worked with whole pieces of coal to avoid complete destruction of the artifacts. Using a rotating lap, a flat surface was ground on each sample. Then, samples were mounted in epoxy, labeled, and polished. An auto- matic polishing device held samples to the lap through a series of progressively-finer grindings. This process created a flat, highly polished surface appropriate for microscopic examination. After polishing, the samples were placed in a desiccator to drive out moisture which can alter reflectance values (Davis 1978:56). A week later, maximum reflectance of the vitrinite component of each sam- ple was measured using a microscope with a ver- tical illuminator and following guidelines outlined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (1990:D2798). Reflectances were measured in oil at 546 nm using a standard with 0.528 reflectance. Rao took ten measurements at different points on each sample. The resulting values were averaged to determine the rank of each coal specimen. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 4. Other characteristics of the coal samples were not specifically studied. However, observations made by Rao on the morphological characteristics of the</page><page sequence="14">124 Arctic Anthropology 29:2 archaeological samples add important information to this study. Results Mean maximum reflectance values (Rö max, %) were obtained for eight out of nine samples. The ninth sample, one of two from Old Karluk, con- tained too little vitrinite for accurate measurement and was excluded from analysis. Reflectance values for the archaeological samples fall into two discrete groups. Five out of eight samples have mean max- imum reflectance values between 0.414 and 0.478. The remaining three have mean values between 0.566 and 0.592. The results suggest that the archaeological coals are from at least two dif- ferent source locales. Although these reflectance values fall within the range of values assigned to both subbituminous and high volatile bituminous coals, the hardness and state of preservation of the archaeological sam- ples (which reflects a greater extent of metamor- phosis) indicate that they are high volatile bitumi- nous coal class C (Given 1984:77; Mitchell 1943: 32). Although the mechanical properties of coal, including hardness, are only loosely correlated with rank (Damberger et al. 1984:39), lignite and subbituminous coals crack and degrade rapidly when exposed to the air due to loss of inherent moisture (P. D. Rao, personal communication, 1991). Consequently, low rank coal is not a suitable material for manufacturing objects. Lignite and subbituminous coals could not be chipped and ground to shape like the Uyak and Old Karluk spec- imens and they would not be preserved. The results of vitrinite reflectance testing, visual examination, and microscopic examination demonstrate that the archaeological coal samples were collected from at least two sources of high volatile bituminous coal class C. As part of this study, we examined a sample of coal from Sitkinak Island. This sample was given to Rao by J. M. Armentrout of Mobil Oil, and was col- lected from the top of the Sitkinak formation on southern Sitkinak Island. Although Merritt and Hawley (1986) report that the Sitkinak coal is sub- bituminous in rank, analyses of moisture content by Rao (personal communication, 1991) indicate that it is actually a high volatile bituminous coal. Nilsen and Moore (1979:22) also report that Sit- kinak coal deposits are bituminous. They describe these deposits as follows: "The coal forms impure layers 1-75 cm thick and locally contains coalified logs in vertical and horizontal positions" (Nilsen and Moore 1979:22). One hundred measurements of a polished sample of this coal produced a mean maximum reflectance value of 0.698 (Table 4). This value is consistent with a bituminous rank, but is signifi- cantly higher than those obtained for the archae- ological samples. Coals with reflectance values in this range, 0.6 to 1.0, are ranked as high volatile bituminous coal class A (Given 1984:77). Micro- scopic inspection also identified differences be- tween the Sitkinak coal and the archaeological samples. The sample of Sitkinak coal is pure vitri- nite devoid of any liptinite or inertite. This is not true of the archaeological samples which have retained morphological evidence of their plant con- stituents, liptinites (P. D. Rao, personal commu- nication, 1991). Patrick Saltonstall (1991), a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, has been experi- menting with coal samples from different sources to isolate variables which may contribute to dif- ferences in coal workability. Although Saltonstall has not specifically studied coals from the Gulf of Alaska, preliminary results suggest that coals high in vitrinite, like the Sitkinak coal, are excessively brittle and shatter easily when worked. In contrast, coals with high liptinite values are more pliable and thus more easily shaped. In combination, the physical differences between the archaeological samples and the sample of Sitkinak coal, and infor- mation on coal workability suggest that the archae- ological specimens did not originate on Sitkinak Island. Despite these differences, it is still possible that Sitkinak Island was a prehistorically used source of coal. We examined only one sample of a little known coal. If this sample is representative of the Sitkinak outcrops, the archaeological samples are not from Sitkinak. However, without additional research, Sitkinak Island cannot be ruled out as a source locale. Variability within the Sitkinak de- posits could create differences in sample rank of this scale or differences in coal morphology. Possible Sources The results presented above eliminate many Gulf coal deposits as possible sources of the archae- ological coal, including all known deposits on Kodiak Island. These deposits have a lower rank than the raw material from which the coal artifacts were produced. Even if lignite does occur in Uyak Bay, it is not the source of the archaeological mate- rial. Similarly, if Rao's sample of Sitkinak coal is representative of the deposit as a whole, Sitkinak coal is too highly ranked to be the source of the archaeological material. Consequently, we must look beyond the Kodiak Archipelago for the source of the archaeological coal. In the Gulf of Alaska there are three major sources of bituminous coal: the Bering River Field, the Matanuska Field, and deposits in the Alaska Peninsula Coal Province. The Bering River Field can be ruled out as a possible source area. Bitumi- nous coals in this field are of a much higher rank than the archaeological samples. The Alaska Divi-</page><page sequence="15">Steff ian: Archaeological Coal 125 sion of Geological and Geophysical Surveys (1990: 15) reports reflectance values of 1.63 to 2.46 for Bering River coals. Similarly, bituminous coals in the Matanuska Field tend to have a higher rank than the archaeological samples (Rao 1975:34). Samples from this field are reported to have reflectance val- ues ranging from 0.50 to 5.00 (Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys 1990:9-11). Both of these fields are inland, some distance from the coast, making them less accessible to maritime peoples than sources of bituminous coal available at tidewater on the Alaska Peninsula and Sitkinak Island. The most likely source of the archaeological coals are bituminous deposits in the Alaska Penin- sula Province. Coal samples from the Chignik and Herendeen Bay fields are characterized as high vol- atile, and have reported reflectance values of 0.57 to 0.95, and 0.55 to 0.90 respectively (Alaska Divi- sion of Geological and Geophysical Surveys 1990: 24, 20). These reflectance values are from a limited number of coal samples and do not necessarily rep- resent the full range of deposits in these fields. Con- sequently, it is likely that the archaeological coal samples with slightly lower reflectance values are from these deposits (P. D. Rao, personal commu- nication, 1991). Although less well known, bituminous coals occur in the Ugashik District, in Amalik Bay (45 km across Shelikof Strait from the Uyak site), and on Sitkinak Island. Bituminous coal deposits on Sit- kinak are farther from the Uyak site than those in Amalik Bay, and are as equally distant as those in the Ugashik District on the Alaska Peninsula. Although Sitkinak Island is part of the Kodiak Archipelago, coal deposits on the island cannot be considered locally available to the residents of the Uyak site and Old Karluk. In sum, all of these lo- calities are possible sources of the archaeological coal. Not surprisingly, the bimodal distribution of reflectance values obtained from the archaeological samples suggests that more than one outcrop of bi- tuminous coal was mined by prehistoric people. The results of this study also suggest that in places where low rank coals are locally available, artifacts were not manufactured from this coal. As described above, low rank coals are too soft to be worked into artifacts and degrade rapidly when exposed to air. Thus, archaeological specimens from Kachemak Bay, Three Saints Bay, and other sites where lignite and subbituminous coals are present are probably made of coal from a nonlocal source. In short, sourcing studies are a way to test existing hypotheses and, as in this case, may pro- vide unexpected results (Harbottle 1982:17). This study is only a first step in understand- ing the origins and distribution of archaeological coals in the Gulf of Alaska. Many questions remain unanswered. Coal deposits in the Gulf, particularly smaller occurrences, are not extensively studied. This makes it difficult to narrow the potential source locales, or to assess the abundance and availability of coal to prehistoric people. We do not know which deposits were easily mineable, the dis- tance between source areas and production sites, the distribution of human population in rela- tionship to source areas and production sites (Earle and Ericson 1977:6), or which deposits provided good quality material. Although this study sug- gests that only high ranked coals can be used in artifact production, we do not know whether all of the high rank coals available in the Gulf of Alaska provide suitable raw material. As Saltonstall (1991) notes, both the composition and depositional his- tory of coals affect their workability. Hence, vari- ability in high rank deposits may have influenced prehistoric procurement patterns. Archaeological survey of coal outcrops could produce additional information. Do quarry sites exist? Can we docu- ment the process of material extraction? Were some outcrops used and others ignored? Ultimately, com- parisons of samples from potential quarry sites with coal artifacts would help to narrow the wide range of potential sources and to characterize individual deposits. Finally, reflectance tests are only one method of analyzing coal samples. This approach needs to be combined with other types of analysis to provide the most accurate view of potential source locales (Harbottle 1982:18), and to identify the factors which may have influenced the choice of a particu- lar coal. Similarly, we need to analyze a much larger number of archaeological samples from a broader range of sites to begin distinguishing between artifacts from individual sources, and to identify spatial and temporal patterns in the dis- tribution of materials from specific sources. Nonlocal Materials in Kachemak Tradition Sites The broader objective of this study is to understand how patterns in the distribution of nonlocal mate- rials reflect the organization of exchange and social interaction in the Kachemak tradition. Coal is one of many nonlocal materials found in Late Kache- mak assemblages. Identifying and sourcing other nonlocal materials and describing patterns in the distribution of these materials is another step in this ongoing study. An analysis of the distribution of all nonlocal materials in Kachemak assemblages is beyond the scope of this paper. However, this section presents some information on nonlocal materials found at the Uyak site to illustrate how these materials provide additional information on interregional relationships. At the Uyak site, car- ibou antler, caribou bone, walrus ivory, marmot</page><page sequence="16">126 Arctic Anthropology 29:2 incisors, andésite, basalt, obsidian, and "baked shale beads" (Workman 1988:13) also provide con- spicuous evidence of travel and exchange. None of these materials are available on Kodiak Island, although together they account for more than 16% of the total artifact assemblage. This highlights the economic importance of materials from beyond Kodiak. At the Uyak site, caribou antler is common,6 represented by 297 artifacts, 6.8% of the total artifact inventory, and 18% of all organic artifacts. Like the coal assemblage, the antler artifacts include finished objects, preforms, and fragments of discarded material, demonstrating that antler artifact production occurred on site. Many common utilitarian objects were made of antler, including most types of hunting and fishing gear, f lakers, awls, wedges, and combs. We also found 59 pieces of worked antler. Many of these are medial sections that were worked and discarded, although two pieces are the bases of shed antlers. The frequency of antler artifacts and the wide range of objects pro- duced from antler indicate that it was a major man- ufacturing material at the Uyak site. Furthermore, like the coal artifact assemblage, antler artifacts occur at nearby KAR-029, but no production of antler tools is reported (Crozier 1989:89). In sum, patterns in the production and distribution of antler artifacts in Uyak Bay are similar to those observed for coal artifacts. Although caribou are not found on Kodiak Island, two herds are indigenous to the Alaska Pen- insula (Alaska Department of Fish and Game 1985: 113-114). The North Alaska Peninsula herd ranges from the Naknek River area to Port Möller (Alaska Department of Fish and Game 1985:111). These car- ibou tend to be found along the western coast of the Alaska Peninsula, but small concentrations occur on the eastern shores. Thus, it is possible that Kodiak Islanders hunted Peninsula caribou, col- lected shed caribou antler, or traded for caribou products with Peninsula peoples. Workman (1988: 13) has also suggested the Alaska Peninsula as a source of caribou products for Kachemak tradition peoples on Kodiak. In addition to antler, there are at least nine pieces of caribou bone in the Uyak artifact assemblage, suggesting that antler was not the only caribou product used by Kodiak Islanders. Faunal analysis, now underway, may identify addi- tional caribou remains. In the Uyak site assemblage there are 65 pieces of ivory, another nonlocal material that occurs commonly. In contrast to antler, ivory was used predominantly for items of personal adorn- ment and small, portable art pieces. We recovered decorated pins, beads, pendants, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, and a fragment of a por- trait mask made of ivory. However, like the coal and antler artifact assemblages, the assemblage of ivory artifacts contains finished objects, preforms, and worked and discarded ivory. Although walruses have been known to stray into the Gulf of Alaska (Severinghaus 1979:21), warmer Gulf waters are outside their natural habitat. The nearest walrus populations are in the Bering Sea. Again, the dis- tribution of ivory artifacts suggests repeated in- teraction with people from areas west of Kodiak Island. Conclusions Throughout this paper, coal and other materials from the Alaskan mainland are referred to as non- local rather than exotic. This distinction is impor- tant. Although the coal, antler, and ivory came from sources beyond Kodiak, they were not exotic raw materials to Late Kachemak people of southern Kodiak. The frequency, use, and distribution of bituminous coal, caribou antler, and walrus ivory in the Uyak Bay and Karluk River area suggest that resources from the Alaskan mainland were of sub- stantial economic importance to Kachemak soci- eties on Kodiak Island. Trips to the Alaskan main- land and/or visits from mainland peoples must have been common occurrences. The Uyak site is not unique in this regard. Many other Kachemak assemblages include nonlocal materials (Workman 1988:13), although the frequency, use, and distri- bution of these materials vary significantly. These distributional patterns provide data to test ideas about the organization of prehistoric societies. In the assemblages discussed above, the distribution of nonlocal materials provides insight to both regional settlement patterns and inter- regional relationships. In Uyak Bay, evidence for the production of objects from nonlocal materials helps to illustrate functional differences between small seasonal camps and villages occupied for more substantial periods of time. On a broader scale, the distribution of nonlocal materials in the regions encompassed by the Kachemak tradition helps to define the extent and direction of pre- historic interaction. The distribution of coal artifacts suggests that production occurred along the coast of Shelikof Strait and that finished objects were traded to adjacent areas. Ultimately, observa- tions like these can be combined with other analy- ses, for example the organization of prehistoric subsistence or the distribution of stylistic elements, to examine ideas about the development and opera- tion of past exchange systems (Earle and Ericson 1977:11). Although this paper focuses on the source and distribution of coal artifacts, it illustrates how the identification of nonlocal materials and of patterns in their distribution can provide significant infor- mation on economic organization and social inter-</page><page sequence="17">Steff ian: Archaeological Coal 127 actions in the Gulf of Alaska. Material source studies are a useful way to evaluate basic assump- tions about culture history and go beyond site level analyses to address regional and interregional questions. At the Uyak site, for example, the exten- sive use of caribou products by Kachemak tradition people is an unexpected finding, one which forces a réévaluation of the breadth of Kachemak sub- sistence.

Endnotes 1. The notable exception is de Laguna (1975: Appendix II), who submitted samples of coal from outcrops in Kachemak Bay for chemical analysis, and examined the production and distribution of coal artifacts in her description of coal beads from Old Town, a late prehistoric site in Yakutat Bay (de Laguna et al. 1964:159). 2. Rank is the technical term used by coal scientists to describe the extent of coal metamorphosis (Rao 1975:33). 3. Jordan and Knecht (1988:231) divide Kachemak tradition sites in the Uyak Bay and the Karluk River areas into two arbitrary size classes. Sites with less than a meter of midden deposit and/or 10 or fewer house depressions are classified as small villages, and sites with more than a meter of deposit and/or more than 10 house depressions are classified as large villages. Although site size is variable, this distinction illustrates broad differences in the location of large and small sites. 4. Small circular inlays are another class of coal artifact found at the Uyak site (Hrdlicka 1944:138). These objects were used to represent pupils in arti- fical eyes associated with a human burial (Hrdlicka 1944:Figure 41). This type of inlay was not found during recent excavations of the Uyak site, or to my knowledge, in any other Kachemak assemblage. In Table 2 these inlays are tabulated in the column labeled "other." 5. Nowak (1978:Plate 7m) found a single piece of coal debitage on the beach below KOD-228, a large village site at the entrance to Spiridon Bay. As this site contains multiple occupations and the proveni- ence of the artifact is unknown, it is not included in this analysis. 6. Antler, caribou bone, and ivory specimens were identified with the help of Craig Gerlach. Artifacts were compared to specimens in the faunal collec- tion at the University of Alaska Museum in Fair- banks. No pieces of moose antler were identified.
