Liverpool: The University Press of Liverpool, Ltd.; London: Hodder and Stoughton, Ltd, 1922. 5s. THE study of the religion of Ancient Rome has been practically revolution- ised in the last generation mainly by the work of two men, Wissowa and Warde Fowler; yet there has hitherto been no short popular presentation of the results accessible to the general English reader. Professor Halliday has admirably supplied the want. In eight lectures he has given a clear picture of the ' Religion of Numa,' and traced its development through the periods of Italian expansion, of Greek influence, of philosophy and of the revival of Augustus with its beginnings of emperor worship. The book is no mere compilation; it is fresh and vital throughout, he keeps religion always in touch with the general political history of Rome, and his line of approach is often original. One might mention in particular the whole chapter on' The Religion of the State,' where he brings out very happily what the transition from an agricultural worship to a state-cult meant and the organisa- tion it involved, the opening of Lecture VI. where a brief page gives a clear idea of the changes which had come in by the time of the Punic wars, and a very penetrating analysis on p. 87 of the three main classes of deities found in the oldest stratum. But there are good things like this all through the book, which to anyone coming new to the subject should be little short of fascinating. The reviewer of a short summary of a large subject generally finds some- thing to complain of as regards omis- sions and on the ground of dogmatism. On the first head I have little to say, though I think that a second edition might contain a few extra pages in Lecture II. on the ritual of the house- hold worship, about which Dei Marchi (II Culto Privato di Roma Antica) has collected a good deal of information. On a smaller point, Professor Halliday on p. 51 rejects the human sacrifice view of the Argei, but proposes no alternative: might not fertility-magic be suggested as a possibility - the Golden Bough supplies a good many parallels ? Under the second head, it is always very difficult to be brief without being dogmatic, but perhaps it is unsafe to state without any sugges- tion of doubt-e.g. that the symbol WP stands for nefastus (p. 44), that the goats at the Lupercalia were sacrificed to Faunus (p. 59) (Faunus = Pan, Lupercalia= Lycaea, and there is the Evander legend in the background), or that Iupiter Feretrius is the god of the thunderbolt (p. Ioo). More serious perhaps is the statement on p. 125 that 'the completely anthropomorphic character of the ideas expressed in presenting a banquet to divine beings is absolutely foreign to the numinism of early Rome'; here you have to reckon with the epulum Iovis and the household offering at the daily meal; Warde Fowler (R.E. p. 173) is much more cautious. Or, again, is it true (p. 149) that 'the influence of the comic stage upon the Roman lower classes was not less potent than the influence of Greek philosophy upon the upper'? Do we know much about the influence of comedy on the lower classes, and is there much profanity in Plautus and Terence ? The Amphitiyon, which Professor Halliday quotes, is surely unique. One or two more criticisms suggest themselves at different points in the book. On p. 39 Professor Halliday writes, 'The collective, ancestral dead, Di Manes': Manes, perhaps, but it is at least doubtful whether the Di Manes were not in the earliest period the underworld gods, of whom we have traces in such persons as Vediovis and Acca Larentia. On p. 70 Quirinus is described as 'a form of Mars'; this is surely misleading. Quirinus was an independent personality, though he doubtless occupied in the Quirinal settlement the same position as Mars did on the Palatine. On p. 79 the derivation of augur from auis is given without an alternative: is not recent</page><page sequence="2">124 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW opinion veering to the alternative con- nexion with the root of augere, seen again in augustus? The augur may well be the 'blesser' rather than the ' bird- man.' On p. 155 I 'think Epicurean scepticism about the existence and nature of the gods is put too strongly. In the last chapter on the Augustan revival, which is admirably done, I do not think it is sufficiently brought out that the inclusion of Apollo on the Palatine and in the Augustan forum was intended to link up the Graeco-Roman cult with the old Roman religion, represented by Vesta and Mars, both in close relation to the emperor him- self. These are all comparatively small points, which Professor Halliday may like to think over before a second edition is due, as I hope it will be very soon. There is no doubt that the book as a whole is a great help to the under- standing of Roman life and thought and should do much to remove the impression that Roman religion was mere 'dry bones.' Professor Halliday first became known to students of classical religion by his excellent essay on Greek Divination: may we hope that he will give us the book that has long been wanted on the difficult problem of Roman divination ?
