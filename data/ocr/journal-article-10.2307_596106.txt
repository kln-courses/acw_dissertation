These common features in the morphology and in the vocabulary discussed above bring us nearer to a possible conclusion that South Ethiopic and North Ethiopic are to be derived from a common language. The absence of these features in Am- haric is due to the fact that in some respects Amharic represents an innovated type in the South Ethiopic group. These few common features be- tween the South Ethiopic languages (other than Amharic) and North Ethiopic should not distract us, however, from stating the many differences between the two groups. These existing differences are numerous enough to justify the classification of Ethiopic from a descriptive point of view into North Ethiopic and South Ethiopic. THE SYNCRETISM OF RELIGIONS IN SOU'1'11EAST ASIA, ESPECTAT1TJY IN THE KHMER EMPIRE LAWRENCE PALBIER BEGGS I. NATURE OF THE MOVE19EENT ONE OF THE MOST ENGAGING movements of the history of Southeast Asia during the first mil- lenium or more of the Christian era was the syncretism or partial syncretism of religions there. The two most important phases of this movement were (1 ) the syncretism of Sivaism and Vishnuism and (2) the syncretism of Hinduism and Bud- dhism, particularly that of the Sivaic Mahesvara and the Mahayanist Lokesvara. Both movements seem to have begun, in Indo-China, as early as the Funan period (about the middle of the first to the middle of the sisth century), but neither reached significant proportions there until near the beginning of the decline of Dmer culture, in the twelfth century. Regarding the relationship between Sivaism and Vishnuism, it must be borne in mind that they are not distinct religions, but related branches of lIinduism, born, in the fourth to the ninth cen-</page><page sequence="2">BRIGGS: The Syncretism of Religions in Soqbtheast Asiat EspeciaJlly in the }thmer Empire 231 turies, of the union of the vague aerial deities of Aryan Brahmanism and local Dravidian deities, to meet the challenge of the new Buddhism for a single anthropomorphic deity. The Fiva of thi3 Neo-Einduism developed from the ATedic god Rudra the Terrible and his attendants, the demons of the storm (of which, in the later ATedic period, Siva was one ), and Siva, a popular Dravidian deity; while the ATedic ATishnu, a somewhat obscure solar deity, absorbed the countless nature myths connected with the local Dravidian deity Erishna. Under the aegis of these two deities, by means of the many forms of Siva and the numerous avatars of Vishnu, a whole multitude o£ aboriginal gods were absorbed. Thus Neo-Einduism was an attempt to combine the monotheisms of Siva and Vishn. u worship with a vast polytheism, and these two great personal deities took the place o£ the pantheon of the Vedas. To satisfy the desires of the monotheists, ATishnu and Siva were sometimes considered as one Harihara. The Trimurti was completed by the addition of Brahma, drawn from brahmsLn, on the model of Siva and ATishnu. To the ATishnuite the Trimurti consisted of ATishnu, Siva as ATishnu, and Brahma as Vishnu, and simi- larly to the Sivaites, with Siva as pivot of the Trimurti. Brahma in Neo-Hinduism was scarcely more than the third member of the Trimurti.l The relations between Sivaism and ATishnuism (which in Indo-China were rival branches of lIin- dnism, with the same related fellow-deities) were close during the Chenla period (about A. D. 550 to 802 ) 2 and progressed intermittently until the reign of Suryavarman II, in the first part of the twelfth century, when a Vishnera-ja seems to have replaced the Sivaite devaraja as the central deity of the royal worship and the great Vishnuite temple of Angkor Wat adopted the form of a pyramid-temple, a form hitherto found in Cambodia only in Sivaite sanctuaries, especially those devoted to the worship of the devaraja and other lingas. From that time on, these two religions seem to have been almost completely amalgamated. The syncretism of Hinduism and Buddhism, which in Indo-China came to be chiefly the amal- gamation or near amalgamation of Mahesvara and 1 J. :Kennedy, " The Hindu Period in Northern India 650-1200," The Impertal Glazetteer of Indita ( Oxford, 1908), II, 305-306. 2 For the periods and reigns of Cambodian history, see Lawrence Palmer Briggs, "A Sketch of Cambodian Eis- tory," Far Eastern Quarterly (FwEQ), VI (1947), 345- 363 hereafter cited as "A Sketch." Lokesvara, may have had a faint beginning as early as the Funan period; but Buddhistn was scarcely dominant in Cambodia not even during the reige of the first Buddhist king, Suryavarman I-until the reign of Jayavarman VII when, with the building program of the second and third periods of that reign, images of Lokesvara appeared everywhere. The religions mentioned above, it must be under- stood, served only the ruling class, which governed the country, designed the monuments and super- vised their construction, carved the statues anfl bas-reliefs and composed and engraved the in- scriptions. The mass of the lihmer population continued in the animism and ancestor-worship common to all monsoon Asia, unaffected by the worship of the intelligentsia, except to pay per- functory homage to the state cult o£ the devaraja and to perform forced labor in the construction and maintenance of the magnificent, but un- doubtedly detested, monuments. II. SYNCRETISM OF SIVAISM AND VISHNIJISM (a) Fishnqbism in Fqbnan and Chenls:Earihara The close relationship between Sivaism and Vish.nuism appeared in Cambodia, as has been said, as early as the beginning of the seventh century, perhaps earlier. Its first manifestation seems to have been the appearance of Harihara, in a form perhaps never found elsewhere-a cur- ious combination of Vishnu and Fiva in a single body, ATishnu on the right, Siva on the le£t (IIari = Vishnu; Hara = Siva). The many statues found in Chenla during the seventh and eighth centuries represent this deity with four arms and two distinct parts from head to footn the Siva side, the ascetic chignon, half the frontal eye, a simple belt around the waist, attributes of Fiva in the two left hands; on the ATishnu side, hair dressed in a high cylindrical cone, cloth falling from waist to knees, with a fold in front, attri- butes of ATishnu on the two right hands.3 This curious deity, said to be mentioned in the Barivam§a, seems to have made its first appear- ance in sculpture in the rock-temple of Badami in the Pallava country of Southeast India, which is dated bT8.4 Eliot thinks it may have reached 3 Larry Briggs, A Pizlprimaye to Angkor (Oakland 1943), pp. 77-79, gives illustrations. 4 Sir Charles Eliot, Hinduism and Buddhitsm (London 1921), III, 114, note 1.</page><page sequence="3">232 BRIGGS: The Syncretism of Religions in Sotztheast Asia, Especially in the Xhmer Empire Funan in the sixth century. Paul Mus thinks it was mentioned by the Chinese in their description of the customs of Funan in 503,5 and Parmentier believes the earliest statues of Harihara found in Cambodia belong to the Funan period.6 It did t:tot appear in an inscription until the reign of Isanavarman I, early in the seventh century, when it appears to have been the prevailing form of worship. At least two inscriptions of this reign- Vat Chakret and Arlg Pou T record the erection of images of Harihara, and some of the stone and bronze figures of that deity are among the best specimens of early Khmer statuary. The cult of this peculiar deity seems to have been an im- portant, when not the leading, form of worship in Chenla during the seventh and eighth centuries and gave its name to a sitc Hariharalaya, " abode of Harihara "-a few kilometers southeast of Angkor, where Jayavarman II located one of his early capitals. Curiously enough, the cult of this deity does not appear to have had a wide acceptance in India and is confined almost exclusively to Cambodia among the llinduized states of Southeast Asia. It appears very seldom in the epigraphy or iconography of Champa (where, however Vishnuism does not oc- cupy a prominent place) and then under the name of Sankara-Narayana.8 It appeared only once- very doubtfully-in Java, at the end of the thir- teenth century, when Harihara was all but for- gotten in Cambodia and Vishnuism and Sivaism seem to have been almost, if not completely, merged. In the Batavia Museum there is a figure supposed to be a statue-portrait of Raden Vijaya (who founded the Majapahit dynasty in 1294), under the sem- blance of Siva. This statue is believed to have come from that king's funerary temple of Siinping, where the Chronicle says a statue of Siva was erected. Among the attributes carried by this figure were the conch and the mace of VishnuS 6 Paul Mus, "L'Hindouisme et le bouddhisme dans l'Indochine," in Sylvain Levi, L'Indochtne (Paris, 1931), I, 103-106. 6 Henri Parmentier, " L'Art presume du Funanj" BuIIettn de 5'Xcote Ptransatse d'.E3wtr&amp;me-Orqent (BEJPtPJO), 1932, 183-189. 7Auguste Barth, " Inscriptions sanscrites du Cam- bodge " (ISC), Acsbdernte des Irsscrtpttons et Belles- Lettres: Nottces et Ewtratts des Manuscrtts (Pari8, 1885), No. 6, Vat Chakret; No. 8, Ang Pou. 8 Georges Maspero, Le royaurne de Champa ( Paris, 1928), p. 11; R.

The conch has the unusual form of the snail and the mace is held in the left hand. A combination of Siva and Vishnu it seems to be, but not a Harihara in the Cambodian sense of the term. Perhaps it is a symbol of the com- plete syneretism of these two deities which at that time seems to have been attained in Cambodia, if not in Java. (b) The Legend of Vish.nq4 in Chenla and Java There is evidence that the legend of Vish.nuS in some of his manifestations other than Harihara, was known in the early inscriptions of the Chenla period. An inscription of Bhavavarman I first king of Chenla, shows that a sister of that king married an Indian brahman and that they made gifts to a temple, on the Mekong near the present border of Laos, of copies of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana and apparently of the Puranas and that they installed regular readings of these works in the sanctuary promising benediction to those who participated in these readings and pronouncing imprecations against those who damaged any of the precious volumes.l° But not too many inferences should be drawn from these facts. While the great Indian epies portray a part of the Vishnu tradi- tion, their use in legend and sculpture is part of inheritance of Hinduism in its widest sense (including Buddhism) and does not necessarily indicate the presence of Vishnuism in any great degree. In Java, the earliest inseriptions compare the king with ATishnu,l1 and seenes from the legends of Rama and Wrishna, avatars of Vishnu decorate the panels of the temple of Prambanan, an early shrine dedicated to Siva; 12 but no shrine of this early period seems to have been dedicated to ATishnu. Java does not seem to have had close commercial connections with India during the ante- Sailendra period. Vogel says that " in the gigantic literature of ancient India, both Sanskrit and Pali, there is but a single mention of Java, which occurs 9 J. Ph.

These they translated into their language and assimilated so completely that all trace of their Indian origin was obliterated. Even today, the uneducated in- habitant of Java or Bali, whose knowledge of Indian gods and heroes is confined to the native shadow-plays and the sculptures he sees on the walls of the temples, does not for a moment doubt that the Pandavas for instance, figure among his native ancestors and that the scenes displayed are those of his native Java, whose landscape is covered with names of mountains, rivers and regions, whicl names have been naturalized from India. (c) Vishnutsrn fourtshed under Jayavarrnon II and Jayavarnzan III At the beginning of the reign of Jayavarman IIS first king of the Eambuja, or Angkor, period, Sivaism became firmly established as the royal worship of the Khmer Empire. In 802, that monarch established his capital on Mahendrapar- vata (Phnom Sulen) and founded the Khmer Empire, in consequence of a ceremony in which that king was supposed to have received divine power from Siva through the intervention of a brahman versed in magic, named IIiranyadama. This brahman used four Tantric texts to make a ritual so that Eambujadesa should have a chak- ravartin 14 king, thus vesting the king with divine power. The central divinity of this new statewult was the king himself conceived as an emanation of Sivaombined with that deity as a sort of god-king, or devaraja, whose visible symbol was a linga set up on the central altar of a pyramid temple, the symbolic center of the Empire, in imitation of Mount Meru, center of the universe 13 Vogel, 47. 14 Chakravartin means " universal sovereign "; but the King of Kambujadesa was a universal sovereign only in the sense that every Indian or Indianized capitaI was supposed to be the center of the universe. He did not attempt to be more than sovereign in his own kingdom, to accomplish which was one of the stated purposes of the ritual. G. Coedes and Pierre Dupont, " L'Inscription de Sdok Kak Thom " (BEFEO, vol. XLIII, 1943-46), stanzas 70-77, hereafter SKT; G. Coedes, " Les etats hindouises d'Indochine et d'Indonesie " (Paris, 1948) pp. 171-173, hereafter, " l!:tats hindouises." in Hindu cosmology.15 And, as in Indian phi- losophy the very essence of an individual is found in germ in his name, the devaraja came to be given the name of the king plus tssara (from Issara, " Lord," an epithet of Siva).16 Jayavarman II appointed his hotar (royal chaplain), Sivakaivalya-, as purohita, or chief priest, of the devaraja, and made the function of celebrating the rites in con- nection with that deity hereditary and exclusive in the family of Sivakaivalya, following matrilineal lines, thus creating a sort of hereditary supreme pontifE. Hiranyadama taught Sivakaivalya the magic ritual to enable the purohtta or other member of the family to create a new devaraja on the accession of a new king. The inscription of Sdok Kak Thom, dated 1052, shows that the here- ditary successors of Sivakaivalya served as priests of the devaraja for at least 250 years.17 Thus at the beginning of the Khmer Empire, Sivaism, in the form of the worship of the devaraja, was firmly established as the state-cult. This did not, how- ever, interfere with other forms of worship nor prevent a king of another faith from ascending the throne and building a chief temple of his own faith, as long as he loyally maintained the state- cult. Thus the worship of the devaraja in Cam- bodia was more a state-cult than a religious sect.18 Although the worship of the devaraja was estab- lished as a state-cult, Vishnuism was very popular during the reigns of Jayavarman II and his son and successor, Jayavarman III. There are no inscriptions of these reigns, but many monuments were dedicated to Vishnu on Mahendraparvata, early capital of Jayavarman II, and many statues of that deity, found there and elsewhere, date from those reigns. In fact, statues of Vishnu seem to have succeeded those of Harihara as the chief objects of Khmer iconography.l9 And at least one, 16Robert Heine-Geldern, " Conception of State and Kingship in Southeast Asia," P1EQ, 2 ( 1942 ), 15-30; Coedes, Pour miew comprendCre Angkor (Paris, 1947), pp. 87-88. 16 Thus the dev¢raja of Indravarman I was called Indressara. It is not known that this system came into use before Indravarman I. No Jageivara for the first two kings has been found in the inscriptions.

An inscription of a later reign says his wife, Bhas-svamim, was a daughter of a Vishnu brahman.20 Another inscription says his wife, Eambujalakshml, had a brother named Vishn. uvala, who received the name of Lakshmlndra and became administrator of the private treasury. These feminine names may denote the same wife and she seems to have been Vishnuite. At any rate, Jayavarman III was Vishn. uite the only Vish- nuite king of Cambodia of whom we are certain, except Suryavarman II, founder of Angkor Wat, nearly two centuries later. The inscription men- tioned above says: "This brahman, B:rishnapala Amarendra, called Kesavabhatta, received the name of Arimathana and became purohita of the king."22 Now, we know that the post of purohita of the devaraja was hereditary with the family of Siva- kaivalya. The Vishnuite names of this " purohita " suggest that the King may have had, in addition to the devaraja of the state-cult, a sort of Vish- nuraja, or center of the king's Vishnu worship, of which Arimathana was purohita. The gurlb of this king, named Nivasakavi, was given the name of Prithinndrapandita and founded the central sanc- tuary of Kok Po, in what was probably the region of the old Amarendrapura, one of Jayavarman II's early capitals. This group of temples seems to have been an important Vihnuite center for several generations.23 On Jayavarman III's death, he received the posthumous name of Vishnuloka.24 (d) Vishnuisnz Subordinclte during Sivaite and Alahayanist Periods During the tenth and eleventh centuries, the worship of Vishnu was not often mentioned in the inscriptions of Cambodia. This was a period of Sivaite development, followed by Mahayanist tolera- tion, then Sivaite reorganization. Vishnuism, as such, was quiescent. The resurgence of Neo-Hin- duism in India, after Mahayanism the cult of the bodhisattvas-had triumphed over Hlnayanism at Wanau; and had established itself at Nalanda, was fraught with danger for Mahayanism, which, 20 A.

This Hindu reaction, which had its origin in the appearance of the worship of Siva and Vishnu in the second century, appeared under the GFupta dynasty in the fourth and fifth centuries 25 and was spurred to action by the triumph of Maha- yanism and the beginning of its decadence at Nalanda. The chief enemy of Buddhism was prob- ably the Vedantic philosopher, Sankara. Born of a Sivaite brahman family, native of Malabar, Sankara travelled all over India to combat Bud- dhism, with the disappearance of which he is credited with being chiefly responsible. He labored, not so much for the new Sivaism as for the restora- tion of ancient Brahmanism-the survival of the tradition of the past, amplified by the many changes which had taken place.26 Absolute being ( brahrnan), Sarikara taught, is " unique, spiritual, internal. The contingent, the relative, the plu- rality-cosmic as well as psychic does not exist." Its appearance is due only to illusion (7naya).27 Thus did Sankara reconcile his acceptance of the pantheism of the Vedas with his belief in ideal monism. He was not a sectarian, but was essen- tially a traditionalist whose religious ideal was a manhood devoted to ritual observance.28 Sankara's teachings found their way to Cam- bodia, although we do not know the extent of his influence there. Coedes has pointed out that Siva- soma, who was a cousin of Jayavarman II, had studied the sastras under Sankara.29 Sivasoma seems to have been chief minister of Indravarman I (877-889) and was the tutor of Vamasiva, who was a nephew of Sukshmavindu and apparently his legitimate heir as purohita of the devarclja. To- gether, Sivasoma and Vamasiva founded an asrarna (monastery) near Angkor. Vamasiva was also guru of the young prince who was to reign as Yasovarman I (889-900).3° Sankara's enemies have charged that he defeated Buddhism in India by absorbing it and have stigmatized him as a Buddhist in disguise.31 One of his chief loans 25 Eliot, op. cit., I, XXXVIII. 26 Eliot, I, XI, 125; II, 315. 27 Rene Grousset, Eistotre d'Eactreme-Orient (Paris, 1929), V, 131. 28 Eliot, I, X. 29 Coedes, op. cit., p. 87. 30 Finot, SKT, p. 89. 31 Eliot, I, X.</page><page sequence="6">BRIGGS: The Syncretism of Religions in 50t4thect,st Asia, Especially in the i:hmer Empire 235 Trailokyanatha.40 The bas-reliefs of this temple- among the earliest in Cambodia-show Vishnu and his sakti, Lakshml, in several legendary scenes and poses.4l It seems to have been Isanavarman II, younger brother and successor of Harshavar- man I, who, on the death of Sikhasiva, of the house of Pranavatman, appointed as his successor, his disciple, Hrishlkesa, "issue of a pure Vishnu family," who was baptized and consecrated under the name of Sivacarya 42 and continued as hofar of Jayavarman IV, Harshavarman II, and Rajen- dravarman II.43 During the sojourn of Jayavar- man IV and his son, Harshavarman II, at Chok GSakgyar (921-944), only one sanctuary the little temple of Prasat Chen was dedicated to Vishnu and that under the unusual vocable of Aripati.44 Under Rajendravarman II (944-968), who moved the capital back to Yasodharapura (Angkor Thom), an inscription records the foundation of a domain to Vishnu and Lakshml.45 It was probably during his reign that Sivacarya erected the two lateral towers dedicated respectively to Brahma and Vishnu at the linga-sanctuary of Sutlsvara and indited there the inscription, later found re-em- ployed at the neighboring temple of Banteay B:dei.46 Indralakshmi, sister of Jayavarman V (968-1001), seems to have been a worshipper of Vishnu. She married a distinguished bhatta from North India named Divakara and together they established images of that deity at what is rlow Siemreap.47 The rlames of the gurqz, Yajnavaraha and his brother Vishnukumara, who built the temple of Banteay Srei, indicate that they may have been Vishnuite and a wing of that temple was dedicated to Vishnu.48 An inscription of Vat 40 E.

It may not have been just a coincidence that Sivasoma and Atmasiva founded the first great Sivasrama in the Angkor region and that a great outburst of asra7na-building took place during the reign of Yasovarman I, when Vamasiva was Vrah Gqlrt4 and chief minister of the king, as well as Lord of the Sivasrama and chief of the service of the devaraja.32 The worship of lIarihara seems to have lingered on for a while in Cambodia. An inscription of Bakong 33 says Indravarman I erected an image of Isvara and Sarngin in an undivided body, appar- ently of Harihara. During the reign of Yaso- varman I, a temple was erected on Phnom Dei to Sankara-Narayana, a not uncommon epithet of lIarihara,34 and that monarch dedicated one of his twelve digraphic inscriptions the only one not dedicated to Siva to Narayana, at Ba Phnom 35 and also erected a Vaishnavasrama (Vishnuite monastery) along with Brahmanist and Buddhist monasteries, in the region to the south of the southeast corner of East Baray,36 as well as mant Yasodharasrama (Sivaite monasteries) in manJ,- parts of the kingdomS wherever digraphic inscrip- tions are found.

In judging the strength of Vishnuism, during these reigns, by names and foundations, it must be borne in mind that Sivaism and Vishnuism are re- lated cults of Hinduism, differing from each other chiefly by the relative rank assigned to the two deities. Sivaites sometimes bore Vishnuite names and the most ardent Sivaite monarch could, with perfect propriety, make a foundation to Vishnu, and vice versa. Still, the existence of Vishnuito names and foundations is in some sense a measure of the strength of Vishnuism during the period. A dynastic re+Tolution brought a Buddhist king to the throne at the beginning of the eleventh century and a Sivaite reaction-or, rather, reor- ganization-followed, about the middle of the century. Vishnuism seems to have received scant patronage during this period. Its only foundation during the reign of Suryavarman I (1002-50), the first Buddhic king, seems to have been Prasat Khna, which was dedicated to Krishna.51 Surya- varman I dug the West Baray and his Sivaite successor, Udayadityavarman II (1050-66) erected the West Mebon there,52 both dedicated to Vishnu. The latter monarch made great use of the Vish- nuite epics (Ranayana and Mclhabharclf cl,) in decorating the new Central Temple, the Baphuon, which he erected for the devaraja. No important Vishnuite foundation marked the reign of Harsha- varman III (1067-90).

There is a great deal of obscurity about the beginnings of this dynasty; but its kings were clearly usurpers, and not until the sixth king (Jayavarman VII), did they claim any relation- ship whatever with any preceding dynasty of Cam- bodia. The first king of this dynasty, Jayavarman VI, seems to have reigned for several years in the upper Mun valley before he conquered the capital and even then he did not completely subdue the preceding dynasty. Among his followers at the beginning of his reign seems to have been the cele- brated Sivaite family of the inscriptions of Ban That and Prasat Tor, which produced the brilliant Tilaka and her son, the first of the three Bhupen- rapanditas who served this dynasty.53 But the inscription of Preah Vihear says Jayavarman VI adored Campesvara (Vishnu) 54 and he made a rich donation to the Vishnuite temple of Wok po.56 Meanwhile, Vishnuism itself was undergoing a transformation in India. Rimanuja, founder of the Vaisnava sect and of modern Vishnuism, though himself a Vedantist, revolted against the absolute monism of Sankara and advocated a quali- fied monism.56 In order that positive religion might subsist, he said, it was necessary to distin- guish man from divinity, to abandon the idea of illusion and to base religion on devotion, or personal piety (bha7cti).57 Faith, not recognition of Indiat tradition, was to Ramanuja the way to Salvation.58 Ramanuja was born in a village near Madras, lived a long life, travelled all over India, and is believed to have died in 1137. He was thus active in India during the early days of the Mahldharapura dy- nasty in Cambodia, but nothing definitely attaches his name to the country of the Whmer. In Java, as Coedes points out, kings of liadiri during this period were claiming to be incarnations of Vishnu.59 Some of the leaders of the revolt of Jayavarman VI have been identified as later ministers of the Vishnuite king, Suryavarman II; and the brahman 63 Finot, " Notes d' pigraphie: 13, L'Inscription de Ban That," BEFEO, 1912, 2, 127; Coedes, "La stele de Prasat Tor," Inscriptions d1s Cambodge I, 229-47. 64 Aponier, II, 214. 66Coedes et Dupont, "Kok Po" (pillars 3-4), st. 4-7. 66 H.

This, however, may be of little significance, at this time. Vedantic phi- losophy and especially the teachings of its greatest apostle, Sankara, hrought about the anomaly that, at the very moment when the formation of Hindu sects was being consummated, they were all be- coming more conscious of their essential unity in mutual dependence on the Vedas and as parts of one great religion, Hinduism. There is no mention of the devaraja in any inscription of the reigns of Suryavarman II or Dharan. lndravarman I. The Baphuon was the Central Temple of Udayadityavarman II, where he housed his Udayadityesvara,61 and was doubt- less his funerary temple after his death.62 What sanctuary housed the devaraja, if any, of the early kings of the Mahldharapura dynasty or their remains after their death, is not known. (f) The Triumph of Tz1,shnuism under Suryavarman II The Tzishnuraja The reign of Suryavarman II (1112-50) was the golden age of Vishnuism in Cambodia. Bud- dhism, which had had a brief day under Surya- varman I and was to blossom forth in great splendor under Jayavarman VII, was temporarily quiescent. The Sivaism of this period-if the state-cult of the devaraja can be so called-was official and perfunctory. Inscriptions show that foundations were still made at the old Sivaite shrines of Preah Vihear, Vat Phu, and Phnom Sandak, and the Bhtlpendrapanditas apparently fervent Si+raites and identified with the dynasty of Mahldharapura from the beginning-still served 6° Aymonier believed that the construction of Angkor Wat was the personal work of Divakara (Le Ctambodge, III, 521 ) . 61 Barth, ISC, p. 17, Lovek, B, 23-26. 62 Coedes, " ktudes Cambodgiennes: 33.

We hear no more of a derclraja, but if such a deity still existed and it almost certainly did the office of chief priest seems to have been performed by Divakarapandita,63 who had crowned three kings in succession and had received the honors of apotheosis, never before accorded to a brahman of his rank in Cambodia. But, if Diva- kara held such a position, it did not prevent him from taking the lead, as he seems to have done, in the development of the new cult of the Vish- nuraja and the erection of its great temple, Angkor Wat.64 It seems that Suryavarman II did not, any more than his Buddhic namesake and predecessor, iden- tify himself with the worship of the devaraja to the extent of having his own image combined with that of Siva and set up in his temple as a Suryessara. Apparently under the aegis of Divakarapandita, the idea of a Vishnuraja began to replace that of a devaraja. This spirit seems to have developed slowly under Sivaic forms. Beng Mealea, Chausay Tevoda, Thommanon, Banteay Samre, Angkor Wat, were the architectural manifestations of it. It was a Vishnuism strangely interwoven with the old state Sivaism. Like Buddhism during the reign of Jaya+rarman V, Vishnuism was raising itself to a position of equality under the guise of Sivaism. Finally, the Central Temple, the ultimate archi- tectural symbol of Sivaism, with its prasats, ter- races, and concentric galleries, and even a central deity, was taken over by Vishnuism, and Angkor Wat-the summum bonum of Sivaic architectural aspiration became the abode of a Vishnuraja. The syncretism of Sivaism and Vishnuism seems from this time to have been complete-in a larger Hinduism. It seems incorrect to say that Sivaism triumphed over Vishnuism in Cambodia. The last great Sivaic temple of Cambodia was the Baphuon. Angkor Wat was the last great Hindu temple in Cambodia and was dedicated to Vishnu and itb decorations were Vishnuite; only its forms were Sivaic. The worship of the devaraja seems to have been merely a state-cult. Then followed a period of Mahayana Buddhism 63 Udayadityavarman II had named Divakara, then a young brahman, to assist Eankarapandita in the dedica- tion of the Baphuon.

An attempt at Sivaic reaction seems to have occupied much of the thirteenth century; but by this time, the syncretism of the two great llindus sects was complete and at the end of that century, Chou Ta-kuan seems to picture Buddhism as the chief religion of the capital (he did not distinguish well between Mahayanism and Hlnayanism) and seems to group Sivaism and Vishnuism-and perhaps also some elements of Mahayanism-under the name of Pan-Ei. III. THE SYNCRETISM OF SIVAISM AND MsHAssNIslkr (a) The Rise of Mahayanisns and the Bodhisattvas Still more intriguing is the syncretism of Sivaism and Mahayanist Buddhism, especially that of Ma- hesvara, a manifestation of Siva, and the bodhi- sattva Avalokitesvara, or Lokesvara as he was generally called in Indo-China. This syncretisnz seems to have had its roots in the birth of Mahayanism in India. When, about the second century of our era, the bodhisattvas were added to Mahayanism, some of them derived their names and some of their characteristics from the Brah- manic gods. Thus, Vajrapani took his name from the thunderbolt (vajra) of Indra along with some of the characteristics of that deity. Thus, Ava- lokitesvara was compounded of two Sanskrit words, avalokita ' looking on ' and tssclra ' lord,' a vocable of Siva. Already when Lokesvara first became pro- minent in Cambodia, in the latter part of the reign of Jayavarman VII, his representations had many of the characteristics of Siva.65. The first three Buddhic councils in North India developed the Tripitclka. At the second general council, held at Vesali, one hundred years after the death of the Buddha (i. e. about 483 B. a.), difficulties developed between the Sthaviravadins (traditionalists) and the Mahasamghikas (who dissented on points of discipline and on the ques- tion of the position of the laics). After the 66 Grousset, p. 73; E. J. Thomas, Eistory of B"Xhist Thox4ght (London, 1933), p. 194; T. A. Gopinatha Rao, Etements of Hindu Iconopraphy (2 v. in 4, Madras, 1914-16 ) . secession of the Mahasamghikas, Asoka called a council of the Sthaviravadins at Pataliputra, in the eighteenth year of his reign (i. e., 256 s. a.). This Council completed the Tripitaka and decided to send out missionaries. After this Council, many of the Sthaviravadins went to Ceylon, which became their principal center, and there (89 s. a.) they decreed the Pali canon and took the name of Theravadin (Pali for Sthaviravadin). Those of this sect remaining in the North came to be called Sarvastivadins (at Mathura) and Mulasarvasti- vadins (in Cashmere) . About A. D. 12S, the :EZu- shan (Indo-Scythian) king, :K:anishka, called a Council at Jalandhara on the border of Cashmere, and there, under the guidance of the buddhic poet and seer, Asvagho$a, it fixed the Sans7crit canon.ff6 Asvaghosa (of Ayodhya) was joined by Nagarjuna (of Andhra, Central Deccan), founder of the first great Buddhist school, the Madhyamika, and to- gether they began to develop the bodhisattvas as a protest against the cold, inexorable doctrines of transmigration based on retribution.67 From the original Mahasamghikas and the Madhyamika dissenters were developed the Mahayanist (Great Vehicle); while the remaining Sarvastivadins (Sanskrit) of the North and the Theravadin (Pali) of Ceylon were called Hlnayanist (Little Vehicle).68 The bodhisattvas, developed by Asvaghosa and Nagarjuna in the second century, were, in the fourth century, elaborated by Asanga and his brother Vasubandhu (founder of the Yogacara [mystic] or Vijnanavadin [idealist] school) into a complex system. " Developing a transcendental conception of the Buddha, it multiplied this great personality, created a hierarchy of Buddhas, divine and eternal, surrounding them with bodhisattvas, their emanation. These marvellous personages were charged with leading the Universe to its supreme end: the transformation of all beings into Buddhas at the end of the metamorphoses." 69 These brothers were natives of Purushapura (Pe- 66 Eendrik Kern, 71fanqxal of Bqxddhism ( Strassburg, 1896), pp. 101-112, 121-126; Grousset, I, 33, 38-39, 64, 69, 78; Jean Przyluski, Le concile de Rajagriha (Paris, 1926) . 67Kern, pp. 122, 126-127; Grousset, I, 76-79, 122-123; P.

They lived at the court of the Guptas.70 Their followers taught at Nalanda from the fifth to the beginning of the eighth century. (b) Buddhisrn in Southeast Asia during the Pre-Angkor and Early Angkor Periods IIldications of the close relationship between Mahesvara and the bodhisattva Lokesvara appeared in Indo-China as early as the fifth century, during the Funan period. About 484, :Sing Eaundinya Jayavarman sent the Buddhist monk Nagasena ou an embassy to the Emperor of China. This monk told the Emperor that it was the custom of Funan to render a cult to Mahesvara and that that deity made supernatural power descend on Mount Motan. Nagasena wrote: "Ee spreads goodness in the world and his benevolent influence acts upon the living. All the kings receive his benefits and all the people are calm. It is because this benefit descends on all that his subjects have submissive sentiments." From this eulogy of Mahesvara, he passed abruptly to the praise of Buddhism. " The Bodhisattva practises mercy. Originally, he was of humble origin. But since he has manifested a heart worthy of the bodhi, he has arrived where th. two vehicles cannot attain. The reforming influ- ence of the Buddha extends over the ten regions. There is no one who does not receive his aid." 71 IIere we have Mahesvara and the Bodhisattva worshipped in the same place, spoken of in the same breath and each in his characteristic role of god of mercy. These remarks seem to show that Lokesvara was meant; 72 but there is nothing else to indicate the worship of Lokesvara in Indo-China during the :Funan period. In the latter part of that period, two Buddhist monks went to China to interpret Buddhist documents into Chinese,;3 and the Buddhic images of Angkor Borei-believed to be of the fifth-sixth century, perhaps the earliest specimens of Khmer statuary-may be of the 70 Grousset, I, 120.

Funan period.74 The Buddhism of Southeast Asia of this period was Mahayanist.75 During the early Chenla period, Buddhism played an even smaller part, and Lokesvara appeared scarcely at all. Isanavarman I (ca. 610-ca. 635) seems to have been the king who I-Ching says per- secuted Buddhism until there were hardly enough Buddhists left to be worth mentioning.76 Under later kings, there were Buddhic inscriptions; but in these inscriptions, the name of Lokesvara appears only twice. One inscription records a gift of slaves to three bodhisattvas: Sastra, Avalokitesvara, and Maitreya,77 and another, in the West Baray region near Angkor, dated 79l, mentions Lokesvara under that name.78 The only Lokesvara images attri- buted to this period are that found at Rachgia, of uncertain date and origin,79 and the bronze figures at Ak Yom, in the West Baray region.8° The latter are believed to be of the sixth and seventh century; but they could have been brought to that sanctuary at a later date. Meantime, Buddhism had been undergoing- some vicissitudes in its homeland. In 643, at a council called at Eanauj by King Earsha-at which the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, IIsuan-chuan, was present-Mahayanism was approved and HlIla- yanism was rejected.81 Those of the latter sect who were not absorbed by other sects withdrew to Ceylon, and IIlnayanism all but disappeared from the land of its birth. It is now quite generally believed that IIlnayanism was not driven out of India by persecution. It lost in fair com- petition, because its strict monasticism, its lack of a metaphysical creed, and its inexorable doctrines of transmigration and retribution did not meet the desires and needs of the Indian people as well as 74 Georges Groslier, " Note sur la sculpture khmere ancienne," Etudes asiatiques (Paris, 1925), I, 309, 311- 3 1 2; A.

Whereas the Elnayanist hope of deliverance lay in the attain- ment of Nirvana, the Mahayanists offered the more attractive prospect of universal attainment of buddahood through bodhisattvaship.82 After the death of Harsha (A. D. 647), the kingdom of Kanauj declined and the hegemony of the Ganges valley fell to the kingdom of Bengal. Here, under the protection of the Pala dynasty (730-1060), the Mahayanists, already surcharged with a whole hierarchy of bodhisattvas and other supernatural beings, became indoctrinated with mysticism, magic practices, Shamanism, Tantrism and what not, which the new popular Sivaite sect was beginning to take on. As this dynasty ex- tended its power over Assam and the Kalinga coast and as Mahayanism began to lose ground to the new Hindu sects, Mahayanist monks spread to Burma and Southeast Asia. It is known that Sanskrit Buddhism, impregnated with Tantrism, came to Burma at an early date.83 The Sailendra dynasty which ruled over much of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula during the eighth and ninth centuries, became a great center from which Mahayana was relayed to all parts of Indo-China and to Western Indenesia until it became the chief form of Buddhism in those regions. It is known that this dynasty was in close contact with northern India at this time. A copper-plate inscription found at Nalanda records a grant to that monas- tery by a king of Suvarnadnpa (Sumatra), grand- son of the king of Yavabhumi (Java), of the Sailendra dynasty.84 Inscriptions of Java, Champa, and Cambodia, as well as accounts of Arab travellers and the record of the arrival of embassies at the court of China, make it certain that the Sailendra was reigning in West and Central Java and South- east Sumatra about the middle of the ninth cen- tury, the date of the Nalanda grant.85 The out- burst of Buddhist architecture and art in Central 82 See note 69- 83 Finot, " Un nouveau document sur le bouddhisme birman," J.

Java of which Borobudur is the chief specimen- bears witness to this Buddhist movement, mixed, however, as in India, with Hindu elements. Coedes points out 86 that the inscription of Ijigor, 77S, in the Malay peninsula, mentions foundations to the bodhisattvas Padmapani and VaJrapani; that of Kalasan, 778, in Java, records a sanctuary to Tara, that of nearby Kelurak, 782, records the erection of an image of Manjusrl, while a Cambodian in- scription, dated 791, mentions the erection of an image of Lokesvara, the only such inscription during the Chenla period. A Cham inscription, dated 829, made by a Buddhist sthavira, says the father of the sthavira erected temples and monasteries to both the Buddha and Siva.87 Finot lists several statues of Lokesvara, in Champa.88 The dates, however, are uncertain. In 87S, Lakshmlndra Bhumlsvara Gramasvamin came to the throne of Champa and ruled as Indravarman II, the first Buddhic king of Champa, and founded the new dynasty of Chan- Ch'eng, with its capital at Indrapura. The first year of his reign, he founded a great monastery at Dong Duong, dedicated to himself jointly with Lokesvara, under the name of Lakshmlndra-Loke- svara. This is the earliest inscription to show the presence of Mahayanist Buddhism in Champa. The same inscription speaks of receiving frorn Siva, via Bhrigu and Uroja, a Sivalinga called Bhadresvara, apparently the talisman of the new dynasty.89 Relations between Champa and Java seem to have been close at this time,90 which may account for the upsurge of Mahayanism in Champa. Cambodia, recently at war with the Maharaja, seems to have been little affected by the Mahayanist movement at this time or for some time later.

It scarcely appears in the epigraphy or iconography of Jayavarulan II, Jayavarman III, and Indra- varman I ( 802-889 ) . Under Yasovarman I ( 889- 900 ), it was of enough importance to merit a monastery (Saugatasrama),91 near the capital but not a Yasodharasrama, as these were dedicated only to Siva and (one) to Vishnu. Buddhism seems to have been wholly absent from Chok Gargyar. With Rajendravarman II came a new era of tolerance, probably partly related to the circum- stances of his succession. Rajendravarman, who had been nearest in line to the throne after the sons of Yasovarman I, saw his uncle, Jayavarman IV, come to the throne by force and on his death secure the succession of his son, Harshavarman II ( 942-44) . Rajendravarman seems to have won after a hard struggle.92 In his eforts to gain the throne, he doubtless sought the assistance of every faction he could, including the Mahayanists, who seem to have been out of favor with Jayavarman IV. An inscription tells us that Rajendravarman II made a study of the Buddhic doctrine; 93 and, although he rejected it, as his many lingas and other foundations and his posthumous name testify, still he appointed as his great minister, Wavindra- rimathana-apparently the first Buddhist minister of the :K:ambuja period and, on his return to Yasodharapura, he entrusted that minister with the construction of a new capital and new religious center. lianndrarimathana, erected a sanctuary at Bat Chum, apparently the first Buddhic sanc- tuary of the Angkor period, dedicated to the Buddha and to the bodhisattvas Lokesvara, Vajra- pani, and Prajnaparamita, and made Buddhist foundations at other sanctuaries.94 According to the inscription of this sanctuary, brahmans could use the ttrtha (bathing-place) at Bat Chum, but only the hotar and the best among them, i. e., those who knew the Vedas. 91 CoedAs, ;; La StEle de Tep Pranam," J.

This minister is said by an inscription to belong to the school of Yogacara (see above III a), " pure doctrine of the void and of subjectivity," which Coedes says bor- rowed a part of its terminology from the Hinduist rituals, and consisted especially of the cult of the bodhisattva Lokesvara.97 With the support, or at least the acquiescence, of Jayavarman V, lilrt;- pan. dita labored to establish Mahayanism in Cam- bodia, and not without success. He brought from foreign lands a great many treatises and commen- taries on Mahayanism and books on Mahayanist philosophy. Buddhist inscriptions of the reign of Jayavarman V show the development of Buddhism under these two kings. The inscription of Phula Banteay Neang, in the province of Battambang7 whose last date is 986, celebrates the erection of images of Prajnaparamita, " Mother of the Buddhas," and Lokesvara.98 An undated inscrip- tion of Prasat Pra Dak, Angkor, begins with an invocation to the three Buddhic ratnas-srtgano7 dharma, and sangha.99 Emile Senart and IIendrik liern have shown how Buddhism was raised to a level with Sivaism during the reign of these two kings by dressing it in Sivaic forms, drowning, as Senart puts it, fundamental differences in super- ficial analogies. Brahmans could bathe in the rtha at Bat Chum. The inscription of Srei Santhor provided that a purohita should be versed in Buddhist doctrine and on festival days should bathe the image of the Buddha and recite Buddhist prayers.l°° Thus Buddhism was raised by having its rites performed in the same forms as Sivaism and through Sivaite agencies. But, although Rajendravarman II and Jaya- varman V helped to establish Buddhism on a sound footing in Cambodia and were also friendly to 95Aymonier, I, 261-270; II, 308-318. 96In a previous article (PsEQ, 1947, 351), this author erroneously stated that JayavarmaIl V was a brother of RajendravarmaIl II. 97 Coedies, lf tats hindouisds, p. 201. 98 Bergaigne, Isav No. 52, Phum Bantei Neang, p. 178. 99 Bergaigne, Isa No. 41, Prasat Pra Dak, pp. 165-166. 100 Emile Senart, "Une Inscription bouddhique du Cambodge," Revue ilrchdolopique, 1883, 182-192; Ay- monier, II, 308-318.</page><page sequence="13">242 BRIGGS: The Syncretism of Religions in Southeast Asia, Especially in the Xhmer Empire Vishn. uism, they were loyal Sivaites, devoted to the cults of the devaraja and ancestor-worship. This was shown by the many important shrines erected by them and consecrated to these cults- Bakrei Chamkrong, Mebon, Pre Rup, Phimeankas. (d) The Religio-Administrative Reforrns of Suryavarman I Suryavarman I was the first Buddhist king of the Angkor period and, although the principal foundations and inscriptions of his reign were Sivaite, the author believes there are reasons to think the revolution of his reign was more signifi- cant than has generally been realized, although its aims and results were more administrative than religious. The ground had been prepared for this movement, even perhaps for the seating of Surya- varman I personally, during the two previous reigns. Suryavarman was the son of the king of Tambralinga (present Ligor), which was so famous a center of Buddhism that a little later it was given the name of Srt Dharmaraja nagara, " City of the King of the Law." The Mahayanist teachings (and probably some teachers ) brought into Cambodia from foreign countries by liirtipandita, probably came, in part at least, from Tambralinga; for Louvo, the only other famous Buddhic center on the east side of the peninsula of Indo-China, was IIlnayanist. It may also be recalled that Surya- varman's mother belonged to a prominent Cam- bodian family, one of whose members Prana- had been a wife of Rajendravarman II and chief secretary of Jayavarman V. No doubt the nucleus of Buddhism established under these two prede- cessors, especially by K1rtipandita, was of great assistance to Suryavarman in gaining the throne and, through the teachers from foreign countries, there may have been a direct connection with Suryavarman in Tambralinga before he came to the throne. Whether there were definite parties or not, it may be conceived that the functionnaires of Cam- bodia consisted of two groups. One group centered in the great privileged hereditary families-repre- sented in the inscriptions of Sdok S:ak Thom, 77at Thipdei B, and Takeo B who furnished purohitas, hotars, and certain hereditary priests and judges. They had doubtless waxed powerful, and the long minorities of Rajendravarman II and Jayavarman V had given them an opportunity to consolidate their power. Naturally they were jealous of their power and looked with disfavor on new families and anything which disturbed the status quo. At this time, the most important functions of these three families were united in the celebrated pandit, Sivacarya.10l The most powerful of the new fam- ilies was that of Saptadevakula, represented in the inscriptions of Ijovek 102 to which familv Surya- varman's mother belonged. Sivacarya served under Jayavarman V and there is no sufficient reason to think that he did not continue under Udayaditya- varman I ( 1001-2 ) and Jayaviravarman (1002-11) until Suryavarman conquered the capital in 1006. The chief representative of the Saptadevakula family at this time was the pandit Sankara. He apparently joined the Buddhist group in favor of Suryavarman at the start. The war is said to have lasted nine years.103 Suryavarman, apparently ascended the Mekong, landed in the east and moved slowly toward the capital. Gradually, as new territory was conquered7 new factions came over to his side. He seems to have got possession of the capital in 1006.1°4 The pacification of the country was completed by 1011. During this period of conquest, several significant events seems to have taken place: (1) the exclusive hereditary privilege of furnishing purohitas to the devaraja was taken away from the house of Siva- kaivalya after the death of Sivacarya; (2) Surya- varman divided the house of Sivakaivalya by taking a member of that house out of the religious life, marrying him to a sister of the queen and giving him important public (but not sacerdotal) func- tions, under the title of Jayendrapandita; (3) as purohita, he named Sankarapandita 105 Of the house of Saptadevakula, who continued to serve in that capacity under several later kings; 106 (4) he strengthened his own claim to the throne by 101 This Eivacaryapandita is not to be confused with the Eivacarya who was hotar of Jayavarman IV.

The argument is given in the author's The Ancient Rhmer Ernp*re (Trans. Amer.

Thus, Suryavarman I seems to have broken down the hereditary exclusive privileges of the powerful sacerdotal oligarchy, divided the most powerful family against itself by the marriage of its most promising member into the royal family, and bound all the functionaires, sacerdotal and political, great and small, to him by a powerful oath of allegiance. The celebration of the rites in connection with the devaraja continued as a state-cult, but the office of purohita and others who could administer these rites was no longer the exclusive prerogative of the family of Sivakaivalya, but was esercised by a member of the family of Saptadevakula, to which the king belonged. There is nothing to indicate that Suryavarman I ever accepted the worship of the devaraja to the estent of identifying himself with Siva in a linga, as his predecessors had done. No inscription men- tions a Suryessara. But he seems to have estab- lished a new capital with a Buddhic central temple on the site of the later Bayon.108 We know little of the architecture of this temple and nothing of its central idol; but the people by that time were accustomed to the idea of a king-god and, although we have nothing tangible to support such an hypo- thesis, in the light of new discoveries, we may at least be permitted to think that the new central idol was a sort of Buddharaja and that the new central temple became Suryavarman I's mausoleum after his death. With the new spirit of tolerationn Sankarapandita could also have served this central idol. The syncretism of Sivaism and Buddhism, which had been going on in Southeast Asia for some time makes this quite possible. 107 Coedes, E7tats hindouises, p. 229; Coedes, Intscrsp- tions, IIs 196; Aymonier, II, 209. 108 Victor Goloubew, " Mission Goloubew: :Recherches dans Ankor Thom," BEFEO, 1936, 619-623 Goloubew "La double enceinte et les avenues d'Ankor Thom, leur etude et leur degagement systematique," Cahiers d e l'PJFEO (asso), 14 (1938), 33-39.

Jayendrapandita whom Suryavarman I had WOI1 to his cause by honors and marriage to a royal princess, continued as guru of the king? taught that monarch all the sastras, built many public works, and probably indited the famous inscription of Sdok Kak Thom which seems to have been the swan-song of the family of Sivakaivalya in 1052 or shortly afterward. But when that king erected his new Central Temple, the Baphuon, and estab- lished therein his golden linga, Udayadityesvara, it was the sage Sankarapandita who was the puro- hita of this new devaraja.l09 This pandit con- tinued to serve IIarshavarman III (1066-90) in this capacity, as he had served the two previous kings, and indited the inscription of Lovek, which gives the genealogy of his family. IIarshavarman IIv3 reign, like that of his brother and predecessor, seems to have been mildly Sivaite. It was in 106T, the first year of his reign, that an unusual catur- m?&gt;rti was erected, composed of Brahma, 77ishnu, and the Buddha-the latter substituted for Siva- the whole consecrated to Siva.1l0 With the advent of the Mahidharapura dy- nasty, about the beginning of the twelfth century, ATishnuism seems to have crept in unobtrusively and to have increased in power until it became the dominant religion.lll Buddhism continued to occupy a subordinate position. The principal Buddhic development was the appearance in Cam- bodia of a new type of Buddhic statue, influenced by the new " School of Lophburi." 112 After the conquest of the Menam valley by Suryavarman I and/or his father, a new Mon-Khmer school of art had been formed theren which was now returnint, to influence the art of Cambodia. Dupont has called to our attention that the Buddha on Naga 109 Barth, " Lovek," B, st 32; Brigs, " Aivacarya." 0 Barth, Isa No. 19, Prasat Prah Khset, pp. 173-177. 1ll This was the period when :Ramanuja was preaching the doctrines of the Vaisnava sect in India.

Before that time, LFoke- svara was mentioned only incidentally, if at all, in the Buddhist inscriptions of Cambodia and hi.s images were few and generally of uncertain origin. The inscription of Tep Pranam near Angkor, dated 893, records the creation of a Buddhist monastery, but does not mention Lokesvara. The three inscriptions of Bat Chum, dated 960, recor(l the foundation at that place of three sanctuaries, consecrated to the Buddha, Vajrapani, and Pra- jnaparamita. One of the inscriptions mentions Lokesvara in the invocation.1l7 The inscription of Srei Santhor (Sithor), giving rules for the practice of Buddhism in general, mentions Lokesvara only incidentally in connection with Prajnaparamita. The inscription of Banteay Neang celebrates the erection of a Lokesvara. The most notable iconographic specimen in this field before Jayavarman VII, which would pass as belonging to an early period of the reign of that monarch, if it were not dated 989 by an inscrip- tion on its base, is a four-faced stele called a cetiya by Finot about I.30 meters high, in beau- tiful red sandstone, found at Thma Pouk, a few kilometers south of Banteay Chmar. Each face i.s a reduction in edifice of a sanctuary with four superposed, retreating storeys. Under the arcature of each storey (including the lower one) is the figure of a deity twenty in all representing, according to the inscription, the Buddha, Indra, Lokesvara, Prajnaparamita, Maitreya, and Vajra- pani. Aymonier thought this monument was Buddhic. Lunet de Lajonquiere called it Vish- nuite. Finot thought the monument was dedicated to Prajiaparamita. He described the Lokesvara on one of its faces as follows: " It is standing, ill short sampot; the torso and legs bare. It wears a high coifEure, in five stages, without the figure of Amitabha. It has a single head and four arms, 116 Madame Gilberte de Coral R6musat, L'Art khrnAr, p. 130. 117 Coedes, " Bat Chum," 257, A, st 30. came into Cambodia during a Vishnuite period, when representations of Vishnu on Sesha were common.1l3 It is to be noted that this statuary consisted chiefly of images of the Buddha. Loke- svara does not seem to have played a prominent part in Mahayanist Buddhism in Cambodia until well into the reign of Jayavarman VII. The Vishnuite zenith under Suryavarman II, which marked the pealt of Angkorean art, was followed by a period of dissension during which Prince Jayavarman, who seems to have had the best claim to the throne, renounced his claim temporarily and went on a long pilgrimage to Champa. Then followed chaos, during which an ambitious functionary assassinated the king and usurped the throne and was finally killed by a Cham invasion, which conquered the country and sacked the capital. Jayavarman returned and, after a long fight, drove out the Chams, restored order and was crowned as Jayavarman VII.1l4 Jayavarman VII was a ZIahayanist and a moody visionary, probably of the Yogacara (mystic) school. His long exile and sufferings, his sight of the destruction of the capital, which he was unable to prevent, and his long struggle to restore order, produced an intense feeling of melancholy in his naturally impressive mind, which feeling was intensified by his marriage to a very intelligent woman, even more mystical and dreamy than he. This experience seems to have made of this exceed- ingly able and naturally susceptible man an almost irresponsible megalomaniac, whose desire to achieve merit for himself and his family knew no bounds. Coming to the throne at an advanced age, he conquered Champa, held it in subjection for several years, pushed the limits of his Empire on all sides to their widest boundaries and entered into an orgy of building, which resulted in the construction of the present walls and towers of Angkor Thom, its central sanctuary, the Bayon, and more than half of the great structures of the Angkor region the greatest conglomeration of architectural splendor that ever proceeded from the mind of one indi- vidual, a building program which probably im- poverished and embittered the country and was the beginning of the downfall of Angkor civilization.1l5 3BEP'EO, 1936, 632. 4 Briggs, ;;A Sketch," pp. 352-353- llS Coedes, Un grand roi du Cambodpe: Jayavarman VII ( Phnom Penh, 1935 ) .</page><page sequence="16">BRIGGS: The Syncretisnt of Religions in Southeast Asia, Especially in the Xhrner Empire 245 holding the lotus, the rosary, the flacoli and the book." 118 (g) Lokessara under Jayavarmnan VII Lokesvara did not figure prominently in the early part of the reign of Jayavarman VII. Preah Shan of Angkor was dedicated to that deity and Ta Prohm- to Prajnaparamita and Coedes points out that they form the Buddhic Trinity, with the Bayon dedicated to the Buddha in its proper place in the center. Smiling bodhisattvas with cylin- drical chignon began to appear in the earliest face-towers of the second period of the Style of the Bayon. But in the third period, images of Ijokesvara came in an avalanche. This was the era of sculptured images. Like the monuments, most of the sculptured figures of ancient Cambodia belong to the reign of Jayavarman VII. According to the inscription of Ta Prohm, 260 small statues were deposited in that temple, while those of Preah :Shan numbered 515.l19 They seem to have been destined to be carried in parades. These idols were almost all, if not all, funerary images, i. e., statues of princes, princesses, or dignitaries, raised to the honors of apotheosis and represented under the traits of a Buddhic divinity, principalltr Lokesvara for the men and Tara or Prajnaparamita for the women.120 Queen Jayarajadevl had a per- fect mania for erecting these "portrait statues." According to the inscription of the Phimeanakas, she " erected everywhere her father, her brothers, friends, relatives and members of her family, known to her or of whom she had heard." 121 Lokesvara was the leading deity of the period and many images of him appeared, some of which were unique at that time and have never since appeared, in Cambodia or elsewhere. The smiling bodhisattva, with diadem and necklace, which appeared in the face-towers of the second period " of the Style of the Bayon," was perfected in the third period.

(h) The Syncretisrn of Lokesrara and SIahessara In the latter part of the second period of the Style of the Bayon, a new type of Lokesvara appeared a Lokesvara which shows the amal- gamation with Mahesvara. This syncretization had been slowly taking place in Cambodia, as shown by the bodhisattvas of the preceding period. But its progress was undoubtedly stepped up at this period by an influx of Mahayanist monks from North India. Mahayanism was already being absorbed there by Sivaism both impregnated with Tantrism, mysticism and other magic practices- (or perhaps it would be more true to say, Mahay- anism was becoming amalgamated with Sivaism), when a new foe arrived. About the middle of the twelfth century, the Senas, a Sivaite dynasty with a strong tendency to Tantrism overthrew the Pala dynasty in Bengal.126 Their triumph was short- lived. In Il9l, the Turkish house of Ghor over- came their overlords of Ghazni. In Il93, they were in Delhi. The next year they plundered Benares. In 1202 they defeated the Senas and drove them into the eastern part of Bengal.127 Some of the Mahayanists, less affected by Tan- trism, fled to Southeast Asia. Others found the transition to Sivaism so slight, it offered little difficulty, proving the truth of the dictum that Mahayanism, in its turn, was not driven out of India until the Sivaites had absorbed all the good 123 Finot, " Lokegvara," pp. 243-244 and pl. 19; Coedes, " Catalogues des pieces originales de sculpture khmer conserves au Musee Indochinois du Trocadero et au Musee Guimet," fig. 42 and p. 30. l2oFinot, "Lokegvara," pp. 250-251; Lunet de Lajon- quiere, III, 295-297. 126 Finot, " Lokegvara," 251-252; Aymonier, II, 233- Lunet de Lajonquiere, III, 387. 126 Grousset, I, 101; V.

Sivaism had its counterpart to the doctrine of the compassionate Lokesvara in the cult of Mahesvara, which was associated with the linga in Indo-China. These two cults became so similar that they flourished side by side without friction, almost without distinction in some cases. The similarity even extended to the personality and attributes of the two deities. Lokesvara was pictured at Angkor with the four arms, four faces, the frontal eye, and sometimes even with the trident and twining serpents of Siva.130 The smiling four-faced Bo- dhisattva, with cylindrical coifEure which appears during the previous period, was further developed, with a diadem replacing the chignon. This period completed the development of the Bodhisattva witl diadem and necklace, diferent from any other Bodhisattva of Khmer Art, seen at its best in the3 towers of the Bayon. " No specimen of the Bodhisattva now known." says Dupont, " and the repertoire of the epoch of the Bayon carries many of them, corresponds exactly with the aspect of the head sculptured on the towers of Jayavarman VII.... The Khmer Lokesvara as far as known, wears a cylindrical chignon and sometimes jewelrv, but diadem and necklace . . . are never [else- where ?] found on them." 131 This syncretization had other implications at this time. We have seen how, in the reign of Jayavarman V, Buddhism had been brought to a level with Sivaism by adopting Sivaic forms (see III c); it is now almost certain that this syn- cretism of Mahayanism with state Sivaism ( Mahe- svara associated with the linga) resulted in the development of a Buddharaja and its substitution for the devaraja. We have seen how, in the reign of Suryavarman II, the syncretism of Sivaism and Vishnuism probably resulted in the substitution of a Vishnuraja for the derclraja and the adoption 128 Eliot, I, X. 129 Eliot, II. 112-113, 120. 130 Finot, " Lokegvara," pp. 230-231. 131 Dupont, "A propos de l'evolution de la statuaire ant,korienne," BEFEO, 1926, 630; Coral Remusat, p. 125 and pl. XXXVI ( 1928 ) . of the pyramid form for the Vishnuite temple of Angkor Wat (see II f). More certain is the sub- stitution of a Buddharaja during the reign of Jayavarman VII and the transiormation of the Bayon i-nto a pyramid-temple, even during the course of its construction.132 There is no doubt that the Bayon was originally dedicated to Lokesvara. The figure found in the fronton and in other prominent places-concealed by later constructions until brought to light by Parmentier in 1923 is the figure of Lokesvara,133 and the four faces of the towers of the Bayon and its walls are the faces of Lokesvara in the image of Jayavarman VII, with whom he is conceived to have been united. But it is just as certain that the Bayon was finally dedicated to the Buddha- raja the Buddha under the lineaments of Jaya- varman VII. The Buddha unearthed bv George Trouve in 1933, at the bottom of the pit under the central socle of the Bayon is the Buddharaja, not a Lokesvara.134 This may account in part for the concealing of the Lokesvara of the fronton by the workmen who attempted to make a tower- -temple of the Bayon in the third period of Jaya- varman VII's reign. The face-towers are believed to be of the late second and early third period, when the Bayon was built on a flat surface and dedicated to Lokesvara. But as the idea that he was the living Buddha began to grow on Jaya- varman VII,135 he conceived the idea of a Buddha- raja himself apotheosized as the Buddha-in place of the temple on the flat plan which he was building. The result was the Bayon and the enormous statue of the Buddha found there. These changes are attributed to the third period of the Style of the Bayon. Tantrism, however, which formed such an im- portant part in the Mahayanism of the North, and even in Java and Bali, did not strike a deep root in Cambodia. Perhaps that was because the extreme Mahayanists of Bengal found their escape in Sivaism or in the countries to the north. Finot thinks it was because the excesses of the Bodhi- 1S2 BEFEO, 1933, 1196-7- 133 Finot, " Lokegvara," p. 216; Briggs, "A Pilyrimaye," p. 88 and pl.

In its early stages, it was accompanied by acts o£ vandalism, of which the Buddhic monu- ments of the Bayon period and earlier show many traces.138 Lokesvara's analogies with Siva prob- ably saved his images from destruction or complete mutilation. The linga seems to have been restored, for an inscription of the fourteenth century tells of the erection of a golden linga and the appoint- ment of a hotar for it.139 It is sometimes said that Sivaism conquered Buddhism in Indo-China, but the evidence does not seem to support that con- tention. The last great Sivaite efort was the Baphuon. The last great IIindu effort was the Vishnuite temple of Angkor Wat. After both these eforts, Mahayanism completely dominated the kingdom and built the Bayon and more than half of the great temples of Cambodia; and, althougll a Sivaite reaction seems to have occupied much of the thirteenth century, at the end of that century Chou Ta-Euan seems to consider Buddhism as the leading popular religion of the capital. "All," he says, " adore the Buddha." 140 Chou Ta-kuan describes in some detail the religions of Angkor and,14l although he admits that he does not understand them thoroughly, his opinions are of great interest, for he was a Bud- dhist and a close observer and spent nearly a year at Angkor. IIe speaks of three sects, or creeds. (1) Buddhism he seems to think is the leading 136 Coedes, Bronzes khmers (Ars Asiatica, 5, Paris 1922), pp. 44-45.

By Buddhism he seems to think chiefly of the new Singhalese Hlnayanist creed, which had come in via Louvo, about the middle of the thirteenth century; for he called their priests chu-kqz, which is said to be a Thai term still applied to Elnayanist bonzes. But he had Mahayanists also in mind, as far as he was able to distinguish them, for he called the four faces of Lokesvara faces of the Buddha.l42 (2) The pan-ki (pandits), who wear the brahmanic cord, were the leaders of the Eindu-sects Sivaite, Vish- nuite, and probably to some degree Mahayanists. (3) The Pa-sseu-wei were apparently worshippers of the linga (not the devaraja). Finot suggested that these were the Pasupata, (an ancient sect), worshippers of Siva, but distinct from the Saiva sect,143 which (the Pasupata) had been in Cam- bodia since the Chenla period. Eliot suggests that they may have absorbed some ideas from the Lin- gayats, a Hindu sect, worshippers of the linga, which originated in southern India about the middle of the twelfth centurft.144 Ee refers to the stele of Ta Prohm (A. . 1186 ), where mention is made of the Jangama, the priestly class of the Lingayats.l45 IV. THE SIVA -BUDDHA CULT IN Ja sa Mahayanism seems to have been introduced into Southeast Asia from Bengal by the Sailendra dy- nasty at the beginning of the eighth century. At least, they both arrived about that time, both seem to have come from that region, and the Sailendra monarchs were the propagators of that creed iu the peninsula and the islands. This form of Buddhism was impregnated in Bengal with the Tantric form known as Vajrayana, Mantrayana, ol Tantrayana. Dr. H. B. Sarkar, who has made R special study of this subject, thinks there is reason to believe the Buddhism of the Borobudur was of this type. It had a tendency to amalgamate with the native IIindu religions, particularly Sivaism.l46 Perhaps because of the strife between the Shmers 142 Pelliot " MemoireS ' p 142 143 Pelliot, " Memoires," 145-150, note 2. 144 Eliot, III, 114. 146 Coedses, " Ta Prohm," st. 4. 146 Eimansu Bhusan Sarkar, " The Cultural Contact between Java and Bengal," Indian Zistortcal Quarterly (I.E.

In Java, according to Kern, at all the great solemnities, both religions the Saivas and the Saugatas, were represented by their priesthood.147 Ultimately, a definite Siva- Buddha cult developed. There is evidence of this cult in Java early in the eleventh century, about the time Suryavarman I, the first Buddhist :EQ:hmer Emperor, came up from Tambralinga to rule at Angkor, although there seems to be no connection between the two events and the Mahayanism of Suryavarman I shows little evidence of Tantrism or even of bodhi- sattva-worship. In the Simpang stone-inscription of 1034, during the reign of Erlangga of Java, the term "Saiva-sogata" occurs; while the Cal- cutta stone-inscription of 104l, during the same reign, uses the term " Sogata-mahesvara.' Dr. Sarkar, who edited both inscriptions, translated both expressions as Siva-:I3uddha.l48 About a century and a half later, the name Siva-Buddha seems to have been applied to lirita- nagara, last king of Tumapel (1272-92), according to the testimony of two later documents. The Cagarakrttagama (see later) says he died in the Siva-buddhaloka, which is equivalent to saying he was absorbed into Siva. Eliot believes that the Chandi Singarara7 built by this king in 1278, was the temple known as Sivabuddhalaya, "abode of Siva," in which he was commemorated under the name of Siva-Buddha.149 This seems to have been the building of mrhich iB:ern says the lower part was devoted to the cult of Siva, while the upper part was a Buddhist shrine, with the statue of the Dhyani-Buddha Aksobhya (probably later).150 Some sources, whose exact dates are not krlowrl but which are quoted by the great works of a later period, make elear the belief at this time in the identity of Siva and the Buddha. According to the Ba?lddhakavya, quoted by the Purusascl7zZa (see below), Siva and the Buddha are identified with each other. " The god Buddha differs not from Siva, the kirlg of gods."

This writer also identifies Siva with the Buddha: Buddhapada is the name of the dwelling of the god Mahadeva (an epithet usually applied to Siva). When Vairocana put the Sve Dhyani-Buddhas (which he called Sugatas) each in line with one of the Sivaite :Susikus, he announced: "We are Siva; we are Buddha.' 151 The reign of Rajasanagara, or H:ayam Wuruk (1350-89), was one of great literary activity in Java and many great works were written during this period which throw light on the syncretism of religions there. The P?lr?lsadasanta, or S?lta- soma, describes the adventures of the bodhisattva Sutasoma. It was written by Tantula during this reign but uses earlier document as stated above. Buddha is declared to be the equivalent of the H:indu Trimurti. Sutasoma was an embodiment of the Buddha. Ee is also equivalent to Vairo- cana, the Srst of the Dhyani-Buddhas. The Nagarakrttagama, written in 1365 by the poet Prapancha, who was the head of the Buddhist clergy, gives an account of the MaJapahit kingdom at its height. The Pararaton, written near the end of the fifteenth century, gives a chronicle of that period. Both speak of a Siva-Buddha, with whom they identify King Eritanagara (see above).152 The Sakyamuni Buddha no longer played any part at all in the religion of Java and the bodhi- sattva Lokesvara played only a very small one. Vairocana, as chief of the Dhyani-Buddhas and Adi-Buddha, was now the principal deittr.153 151 Sarkar, Indian Infl&gt;uence on the Literature of Java and Bali (Calcutta, 1934), p. 386; Krom, II, 298-304. 152 Krom, II, 303; George Coedses, Les Stats htndorsds d'Indochtne et d'lndonesie (Paris, 1948), pp. 333, 400; Sarkar, "Indian Influences,' 230, 319-322, 385; Sarkar, " Siva-Buddha," p. 285. 163 Krom, p. 303. In Tantric Northern Buddhism, which Java imported from Bengal, there were five " celes- tial " or "meditative " Buddhasn known as Dhyani- Buddhas. Each had a correspondin Dhyani-Bodhisattva and a corresponding Manushi-Buddha ( " earthly " Buddha). The present (fourth) Manushi-Buddha is the Akyamuni. The corresponding Dhyani-Buddha of which Gakyamuni is an emanation, is Amitabha. The corre- sponding Dhyani-Bodhisattva is Avalokitefivara, or Loke^ fivara.

Przyluski has ad- vanced the idea that, when the Bataks of Sumatra were converted to Hinduism and gave Indian names to their gods, their chief god, Bataraguru, who resided on the mountain, became identified with Siva-Rudra and after the syncretism became Buddha.-Alice Getty, The Gods of Northern BudHhtsrn ( Oxford, 1928 ), pp. 1-78; Alfred Foucher, lOtude sur l'iconopraphie bouddhique de l'Inde ( Paris, 1900-5 ), I, 76-128; II, 15-49.

In the Tantric treatise, Sang hyang leamahayanikan, written partly in Old Javanese, various entities are interspersed between Bhattara-Buddha and the Dhyani-Buddhas, and the former appears as a sort of Xdi-Buddha. Thus in Java we have the syncretism of Siva, Buddha, and the chief Indonesian deity.154 164 Jean Przyluski, " The CailendravamsaJ" J&amp;IS, VI ( 1935), 31-32.

In tracing back the history of the San-kuo Chth, there is every reason to believe it is closely involved with the story-teller's prompt-books, or hxa-pen (g$), which date from the Sung-Yuan period. There is also reason to hope that some light can be thrown on the meaning of the term p'tng- hua by referring to the few studies 4 by Western scholars on the huzc-pen. Jaroslav Prusek attempts the following definition of the term p'tng-hqDa: Opposed to tz'u-hua (JE [? narrations with tz'u]) or shih-hua (ig [ narrations with poems]) was the p'ing-hi6a or ' plain narration ' without, or with very few poems.6 A brief check on the statistics would have shown Prusek his error.

The history of the Romance of {he Three leing- doms (San-klbo Chth Yen-i) from the earliest known edition-that attributed to Lo Kuan-chung, published during the hung-chth reign period of the Ming (1488-1506)1 is a very complex muddle. Anyone who attempts a definitive treatment of this period in the life of the Romance of {he Three Zingdoms is lacking the better part of valor. 13:i Shih's excellent critical work2 is of considerable help, but even so the number of variant versions in existence today, and the successive liberties taken with the text each time it is republished, would benight the most diligent sinolog. We shall have reason to return to this subject later. If, however, one starts with the 1494 edition and works backward in time, the task is not nearly so difficult and is much more rewarding. The logical place to begin, then, is with the preface of the 1494 edition. Here, right at the outset, we have a clue.
