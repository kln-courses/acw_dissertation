<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLES NINO LANGIULLI GOD IN CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT God in Contemporary Thought: A Philosophical Perspective. Edited, with an Introduction by Sebastian Matczak. New York: Learned Publications, 1977. Pp. 1119. As any American college teacher of philosophy knows, there are too many an thologies or collections of "philosophy." Higher "education's" recently acquired but unrequited lust for novelty, or "innovation" as our pedagogical masters would have it, has increased the demand for such products. And publishers seem only too eager to satisfy such an incongruous desire. The phenomenon of editors singing and dancing to the Zeitgeist is so much a part of the academic scene that apologists no longer find a need in the name of expediency to excuse it. The world does not even end with a whimper, let alone a bang. A serious anthology or collection must avoid the Scylla of simpering relativism and the Charybdis of arrogant dogmatism. The juxtaposition of the wit and wisdom of Bob Dylan with the political reflections of Aristotle cannot fail to stimu late the relativistic dry rot further. On the other hand the dogmatic productions of, say, the positivists and their minions, is like the pornographic conception of sex. Neither enterprise is serious. A good anthology is one whose selections cohere and which accomplish their objective. Professor Matczak's anthology is both serious and good, but it is not without some faults. For example, it is regrettable that he chose to include a selection entitled "The Unification View of God" (p. 727), an exposition of Sung Myung Moon's theology by Lee Sang Hun. Admittedly, argu ments can be construed to justify the inclusion. But the same arguments could be used to justify the inclusion of Reverend Jim Jones's conception of God. For those who might not remember, the Jim Jones I speak of is the "prophet" of the fall 1978 Guyana massacre. It is a mark of good education to resist some things. Not every thing has to be accepted or tolerated. One can fall into the trap of being falsely eirenic in the effort to be "open" and ecumenical. So called "Christian-Marxist dialogues" or "encounters" bespeak such a tone of political naivete that it would be mildly amusing if it were not so pathetic. Lee Sang Hun's discussion of the "U nifica tion View of God" is what it seems to be ? a semi-literate syncretistic exercise. We are told that God has "both internal or spiritual and external or energetic aspects" which are called "Sung Sang" and "Hyung Sang" respectively. Together these are called the "duality of God." We are also told that besides this duality, there is 83</page><page sequence="2">84 The Polish Review another pair of complementary features "not dealt with in the traditional view" called "Positivity" and "Negativity" (p. 728). Hun apparently has not heard of the cataphatic-apophatic tradition. "Heart" is spoken of as "the essential and funda mental feature of God" (p. 732). The location of "Heart" is in the Inner Sung Sang and it lies deeper in the total mind than emotion, intellect, or will. It is the core of the mind of God which moved him to create the universe (p. 732). In order to give this language a semblance of respectability and acceptability Hun resorts to technical artifices ? an old flim-flam device ? such as "the Quadruple Base" (pp. 737-741) and the "O-D-U Action" (Origin-Division-Union) (pp. 746-747). Of course there are inner and outer "Quadruple bases" and inner and outer "O-D-U actions." This article does not belong in the book. It merely detracts from the seriousness and purpose of the enterprise. Now there is another article in the book which, al though it is serious and scholarly, also does not belong. It is the essay by Michel Masson entitled "Neo-Confucianism: Ethics of Fung Yu Lan," wherein there is not a single mention of God. While Fung Yu Lan's ethico-social theories and his rap prochement to Marxism may be interesting to students of contemporary Chinese thought, his silence about God does not make a discussion of his views appropriate in a book concerned with this subject. The objective of the anthology is stated clearly and distinctly in the introduction, i.e., "to contribute to a better understanding of the supreme subject (reviewer's emphasis) of religions, more particularly the Divine, and to our way of knowing Him." In order to accomplish this objective, the editor employs a four-part struc ture to organize the readings and establish the required coherence. The first part is entitled "God in Ancient Cultures" and it is subdivided into sections that discuss "God" as found in African, Chinese, Asian Indian, Japanese, and Judaic religious traditions. This first part might appear to be anomalous, inasmuch as the book is concerned with contemporary thinking about God, but when we realize that these conceptions of God in ancient cultures continue into the present, the apparent anomaly is dispelled. The second part is devoted to the concept Of God in the Christian tradition. The titles "Pre-Christian God" and "God in Christian Teaching" designate the major subdivisions of this part. The first subdivision is further subdivided into sections entitled "Platonic and Christian Theism" and "Aristotle on God." The second sub division contains discussions of God in the Catholic, the Reformation, the Oriental Orthodox, and the Greek Orthodox traditions. In Part Three ? "Selected Thinkers on God" ? the subdivisions possess the titles "Philosophy," "Literature," "Psychology," and "Art." The last two categories con tain one article each, i.e., "God and Depth Psychology" and "Universal Thought and the Arts in Modern Time." This essay on the arts, although lively and interest ing in its account of the interplay of modern thought and art, seems to have little to say about the presence or absence of the concept of God in modern art. Upon a closer reading, however, one finds the following sentence on p. 968: "He was thoroughly misunderstood by those who thought the human ideal in Beyond Good and Evil immoral and interpreted his pronouncement, 'God is dead' to mean that Nietzsche was denying universal thought, God." It appears that the author of the essay, Andrew Osze, associates, nay identifies, "universal thought"and "God." And</page><page sequence="3">God in Contemporary Thought _85 the essay does have much to say about "universal thought" in art. But the identifica tion is by no means a noncontroversial one. "Universal thought"and "God"do not mean the same thing either in ordinary discourse, philosophical discourse, or even theological discourse. If Osze meant by "universal thought" Aristotle's "Thought thinking itself" or Hegel's "Absolute Mind," he does not make clear that he does. These concepts too are not without their own problems in being identified with "God." The subdivision on literature contains two articles, one concerned with God in modern literature in general and the other with what the author calls the "two domi nant views of God" in modern poetry. The subdivision on philosophy is the longest part of the book and covers such thinkers as Hume, Marx, Heidegger, Whitehead, Sartre, Marcel, Tillich, and such movements as "process theology,""analytic phil osophy," and "death of God" theology. Therein one also finds an article on "modern religious thought" and the mysticism of St. John of the Cross. The fourth part is concerned with what the editor refers to as "specific problems." The articles cover the following issues: rational religion; causality; the problem of suffering; the relationship of the world to God; a contemporary Jewish view of suf fering; and hope. The book is 1119 pages long; it possesses an index of names as well as ? and this is one of its most useful features ? valuable selected bibliographies at the end of each essay. It is this feature together with the comprehensive range of the selections that make this anthology, whatever its faults may be, a worthy instrument of and for study by students of religion, of philosophy, of theology and of God. As such a tool, it may be regarded as a reference book, a textbook, or as supplementary read ing to primary sources. A judgment about the book as a whole does not eliminate, however, the need for judgments about its parts. For example, the selection concerned with the so-called "death-of-God" theology and the one which discusses the concept of God in "Ana lytic Philosophy" are especially informative. The display of a wide range of opinion and discussion within these two contemporary currents of thought cannot but instruct the serious student of God and "God-talk" about the logical nuances, sup positions and consequences of such talk and the ontological ramifications of the existence (or nonexistence) and nature of such a being. There are many good dis tinctions made concerning the kinds of "death-of-God" theologies and the sources from which they arise. Moreover, the author of the selection concludes with some admirably tough thinking. In comparing "death-of-God" theologians to radically secular humanists, he says that the former are less radically secular, because for one reason or another, or for one feeling or another, "they are simply unwilling to go all the way." "Soft" radical death-of-God theologians retain a vague belief in God's existence and in the existence of an afterlife through a conscious clinging to reli gious language, images and feelings despite complete demythologization. "Hard" radical death-of-God theologians cling to a kind of Jesus whom they find indis pensable and to a kind of membership in the Christian community. The author, Eric C. Meyer, then suggests that these theologians ignore or disown radical secular humanists such as Feuerbach and Russell, because the latter are either reminders of the frankness required of such a position, or they "illustrate embarrassingly well</page><page sequence="4">86 The Polish Review both the true logic of 'hard'death-of-God theology and also the few remaining steps . .. [they] have to take in 'adapting' faith radically to the radically secular world of today." The selection on God in analytic philosophy confronts us with an interesting but vexing issue. Besides giving us a range of opinion on God and methods of "God talk" in analytic philosophy, the author of the article offers his readers a criticism of the views and arguments of logical positivists but seems to endorse the theory of language and meaning in the later Wittgenstein ? the Wittgenstein of "family resemblance," "meaning-as-use," and "language games." The author also affirms what he claims to be a Heideggerian view of language ? a view which regards trust as the ground of all meaningful discourse. "All the meaningful modalities of human discourse have in common that they are fiduciary, i.e., they are grounded in the reciprocal trust of men as they communicate with one another." Now, while it is true that the logical positivists confused meaning with truth and mistook scientific language as the paradigm of all speech activity, they were concerned with truth and falsity, or better, with verifiability and falsifiability. Forsaking the absolute of scien tific language need not involve embracing the relativity of "language games" or "forms of life." It is not enough to say that theists understand one another when they say that "God exists," or Christians that "God is triune," or Moslems that "there is but one God." It is not even enough to say that for these and other believers their speech is "rule-governed" such that they do not say anything whatsoever ? such as, God has material properties like weight or mass. It is essential for believers and for the philosopher of religion, however much they may trust one another, that the propositions of belief be true ox false. Furthermore, it does not seem to be the case that human language is distinctively communication; for other animals do seem to communicate. The characteristic of human speech ? the mode of being human in the world ? is to know and to understand what is ? reality. Human speech is distinctively logos ? propositional speech. The question of language is raised in a different manner in the article "On the Whiteheadian God" by Richard Martin. The reader is cautioned against two slogans that are the result of careless thinking: "Mathematica sunt, non leguntur" and "Metaphysica sunt, non leguntur." Martin eschews both attitudes in his attempt to exhibit the logical structure of Whitehead's language about God. Conse quently he constructs a format by means of an artificial formal language (as op posed to a natural informal one) to display Whitehead's categoreal scheme and his theory of God, as well as to meet the requirements of interrelated mathematical and metaphysical thinking. This format or logical structure employs neither the familiar notation of Principia Mathematica nor the equally familiar "Polish" notation but one which is made up from Whitehead's own words such as "prehension"and "con crescence." Martin does this, I am sure, to teach the reader the freedom and versa tility of the logico-mathematical methods. His conclusion, moreover, is that "the exhibition of such structure is not only an aid to understanding... it is so important that without it we cannot be said to know what that theory really is," i.e., White head's theory of God. Reading Professor Martin's paper reminded me of that time many years ago when 1 took his course in symbolic logic at New York University. Again I was awed by the way he manipulates the permutations of a symbolic notation. Again I was struck by his commitment to and his conviction that meaning</page><page sequence="5">God in Contemporary Thought_87 and truth can only be accomplished by a faithful and patient adherence to the rigors of modern logical systems. But as I was unconvinced then, I remain unconvinced now concerning the opinion that one cannot draw inferences, grasp assumptions, or in general reason rigorously and correctly without dependence on artificial symbol systems (or languages). But this is an argument beyond the scope of this review, and therefore it will be dropped. It is troubling, however, when one reads Whitehead stating that "God is the primordial creature." It is troubling because all the careful and patient logico formal work did not keep him from saying something so "logically" odd as that. And Professor Martin does not question it. No Maimonides, Aquinas, or Avicenna would have called God a "creature," primordial or not. For, if God is anything, "He" is surely not a creature. Of course Whitehead cannot hide behind the claim of using the word "creature" loosely to designate an existing thing. Looseness is not permitted to those whose philosophical enterprise is to construct carefully and patiently logico-formal systems of acute precision. In the article "God in African Thought and Life," the author wishes to impress his readers with the use of a term that is "relatively neutral" for describing "God" or "Gods." That term is "divinity." Divinity, we are told, is essentially spiritual, despite anthropomorphic features and transitory forms. While strongly asserting the diver sity of African thought and culture, the author says that it is "almost universal" in African thought that divinity is related to all natural phenomena and that Africans believe in "a mysterious creative force responsible for the world and its living beings." What is more, the Kenyan theologian, John S. Mbiti, is quoted as saying that "every African people recognizes God as One." This is an interesting remark and it is an echo of Wilhelm Schmidt's view that underlying the polytheism or heno theism of ancient or early peoples there is monotheism. Unfortunately, I have used words the author warns us against. He says that "most Africans avoid the pastime which preoccupies members of other cultures who try to define God, and are then snared into worshipping their definitions . . ."and that "without abandoning the central subject of our investigation, God, it recommended that we for a time remove those connotations of the term which are associated with so-called classical reli gions (reviewer's emphasis). Monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, and henotheism are such concepts, loaded with preconceptions and fraught with rationalizations ..." Patrologists will be delighted to learn that the Alexandrian Fathers were engaged in a numbers game and that St. Augustine was a maverick in a sense in which they are unfamiliar ? that unlike most of his fellow Africans, he was en gaged in a pastime in the writing of De Trinitate. The article on Islam, although informative, omits discussion of some great Islamic thinkers who had profound things to say about God. I speak of Averroes, Avicenna and Al Farabi. Instead he begins a discussion of mysticism with the trivial remark that theological debates were of "greater significance to theologians than to the rank and file believer." What of it? This will always be the case, but it is the theo logians who formulate and give rational accounts of concepts of God. As regards mysticism, he tells us that the greatest contribution of the mystics is not to describe the indescribable (a common but unnecessary paradox) but to be the spokesmen of "the possibility of direct access to that which is beyond conception, language and imagination" ? an equally common and equally unnecessary paradox. This is not</page><page sequence="6">88 The Polish Review to say that direct access to God (whatever that may be) is impossible but if it is some thing that is beyond conception then one is tempted to say that it may be nothing at all. A mystic may speak, or better, be with God; but he and his promoters will have to learn that if he is going to tell other men about it, he is going to have to pay the logical piper. St. John of the Cross knew this and the thoughtful and acute article on his mysticism by Robert Herrera makes the point in a simple and profound manner. The articles on Taoism and Buddhism reminded me of John Senior's cleverly cynical but justifiable remark, Eastward ho ? hum! The remark must be under stood, of course, in light of the fact that one repeatedly finds among Westerners a hankering for Eastern depths or Eastern enlightenment ? a hankering born of ignorance and contempt for non-exotic Western experience. In the conclusion of the discussion of Taoism, the reader is confronted with the author's hope that "future Christian scholars become familiar with these [Taoist] texts and use them to explain the existence and the attributes of the Triune God." Aside from reeking of naive ecumenism, and aside from either forgetting or ignoring the work of some rather good Christian scholars, such as Athanasius, Augustine, and Gregory of Nyssa, the Taoist texts he quotes could hardly be used to explain the Triune God when they are so badly in need of explanation themselves. For example, how can the Tao be "the ultimate and supreme principle governing the universe" (p. 88) and yet "model itself after Nature" (p. 84). In the latter case it would seem that "Nature" is higher or greater than Tao if Tao models itself after it or her. As far as the Buddhist approach to God is concerned, the reader is informed that the principle of "the middleway" is authentically Buddhistic. The "pragmatic and philosophical nature of Buddhist religion" is disclosed in not making an "ontic commitment to anything whatsoever." Consequently authentic Buddhism lies between theism and atheism and the Buddhist logic of fourfold negation is con sistent with Buddhist ontology in that there can be no ontic assertion about any thing whatsoever. According to the Buddhist middle way, "The problem of the existence of God or the Absolute is 'null and void'" (p. 158). Two of the annoying features of the essay are, on the one hand, the author's opposition between the terms "pragmatic" and "philosophic,"and on the other, the unclear use of the important term "Dharma." "Pragmatic" is not the opposite of "philosophic." If the opposition between "practical"and "speculative" or "theoreti cal" is meant, then these terms should be used. "Dharma" sometimes found without the capital or in the plural leaves the reader groping for a precise sense of the term, or at least the precise context in which each form of the term is being employed. It seems to mean "way" or "teaching," or "truth." Such ambiguity cannot be too "en lightening." This anthology is a book with many words on many pages. This is as it should be. For discourse ? rational discourse (logos) ? is the mode of being of the human animal. Not feeling, either of the erotic or aggressive kind; not instinct; not the hand whose thumb can touch the other fingers; not survival, the new "virtue" of our current wisdom, but discourse. To be sure, the human animal possesses these other characteristics, but so do other animals. It is when these other characteristics are connected to discourse and when they are asserted and understood by discourse that we hit upon the human as such ? even when these animals are not on speaking terms with each other or with God.</page></plain_text>
