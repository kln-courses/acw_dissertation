On the other hand, neglecting the signature 's  trace is hardly more benign. Only the unsigned work seems to  provide a reprieve from the dilemma, as if the author had deliv­ ered his or her prior pardon for the erasure of signature that the  reader will perform. This is largely wishful, of course, as the case  of Rousseau can once again illustrate : his insistent fretting over  the fate of his signature did not exempt, on the contrary, the fate  of his "unsigned" novel, La Nouvelle Heloise. But what if one  were to juxtapose this text with other "unsigned" works that it  recalls or repeats ? Would it not then appear that some kind of  permission for this gesture has been sought in the conditional  absence affecting the signature ? Although I ask the question in  view of a certain generalization about reading signatures, I offer  it first autobiographically, having myself elsewhere assembled  for study five texts, including La Nouvelle Heloise, which all  disturbed in some fashion the simple attribution of authorship. 1   1 Peggy Kamuf, Fictions of Feminine Desire: Disclosures of Heloise ILincoln,  Nebr., 1 982 ) .  The other four texts are the letters of Heloise and Abelard, Les  Lettres portugaises, La Princesse de Cleves, and Les Liaisons dangereuses.  12 3  </page> <page sequence="4"> 1 24 I No One Signs for the Other  While I was interested by the circumstance that none of the  texts was unequivocally signed, I did not then interrogate the  coincidence of the five absent signatures which I had brought  about. Since then and unexpectedly, I found myself confronted  with this coincidence while puzzling over what seemed a par­ ticularly cryptic assertion in Paul de Man's essay "Autobiogra­ phy as De-Facement. 11 The assertion, I discovered, became more  accessible only after it had turned the tables on me, so to speak,  and given me some access to my own encrypted fascination  with missing signatures .  De Man writes : "Any book with a  readable title page is, to some extent, autobiographical. 1 12 I  cannot say what prompted me to read this sentence "auto­ biographically, 11 but once I had done so I also noticed something  that should have stood out from the first : the work is auto­ biographical, asserts de Man, to the extent that its title page, the  place of the signature, is readable. That is, the minimum crite­ rion for autobiography concerns the readability of proper names,  more precisely of signatures .  It therefore points to the necessary  deviation of the name from what it properly signifies, necessary  if the name is to become readable or iterable.  But what, then, is a readable autobiography? Or rather, whose  autobiography does one read when reading signatures and the  texts they sign? It now seems that what is problematic in the  sentence "any book with a readable title page is autobiographi­ cal" is less the difficulty of consenting to such an all-inclusive  assertion than the difficulty of facing up to the way it upsets a  basic certainty about the autobiographical work and its signa­ ture. By making it a function of readability, de Man does not so  much dissociate autobiography from writing and the writer as  place it between writer and reader, writing and reading. Thus  the same gesture both allows one to assert that any text is more  or less autobiographical and prevents a certain attribution of  autobiography to reader or writer. Autobiography is an all-in­ clusive genre precisely to the extent that it remains impossible  to conclude whose life is being written-or read.  The implications of generalized autobiography would have to  2De Man, Rhetoric of Romanticism, 70.  </page> <page sequence="5"> Baudelaire au feminin I 1 2  5  be taken into account whenever a relation between signature  and work is at issue; whenever, that is, readable title pages are  considered part of the work to be read ( and to a certain extent, as  de Man would say, they always are ) .  This, of course, is easier  said than done, since what has to be taken into account by  definition cannot be fully calculated or predicted by any one  reading or writing subject.3 Yet not ever fully knowing what is  going on when one reads and writes does not mean that the  complications, the co-implications of signature simply disap­ pear when one's purpose is to construct some theory of its  workings. This double bind leaves its mark whether one knows  it or not. Such a setting aside or ignoring of co-implications  would, however, be necessary to transfer any formal aspect of  the signature to the text of the work it signs. If, for example, this  move were to take one from the fact of a male or rather a male's  signature on certain theoretical texts-those, for instance, that  have so complicated thinking about signatures-to the notion  of something called "male theory, " then one would have ef­ fected the sort of transfer from form to meaning which de Man  describes according to patterns of metaphor and metonymy.  These are patterns whose epistemological reliability is not nec­ essarily enhanced by being pressed into the service of political  or other programs.  On the contrary. Specifically, the move from  the signature of a male to a "male signature, " and from there to  something called "male theory, " transfers a formal, known  attribute from one "thing" to the nonappearing, nonphenome­ nological "thing" that is the meaning of a text.4 As in the  psychoanalytic situation of transference, the interpreter is at  3A text such as Jacques Derrida's Glas, whose author obviously calculates to  an entirely new power the autobiographical back and forth between readable  signatures, is at the same time a persistent demonstration of the necessary  failure of that calculation, the unsaturable context of any text that makes for its  interest. "But you can take interest in what I am doing here only insofar as you  would be right to believe that-somewhere-I do not know what I am doing"  ( 64R) .   4Alice Jardine, in Gynesis: Configurations of Women and Modernity ( Ithaca,  N. Y., 1 98 5 ) ,  refines somewhat each of these steps. Still she retains the positions  in their integrity and speculates on what a "female signature" would look like  ( 1 8 5 ) .  </page> <page sequence="6"> 1 2 6  I No One Signs for the Other  high risk in this situation of plugging her or his own "content"  into that space presumed to be full of meaning which is a text.  Yet, if we recall the aphorism about title pages, it would seem  that this kind of "autobiographical" or transferential operation  is also what allows a text to become readable. It is thus, to some  extent, inevitable. Is this not, therefore, a circle of some sort­ hermeneutic, vicious, or solipsistic? The answer to that ques­ tion can never be a simple yes, precisely because there is auto­ biography circulating through all the transfers of meaning. The  circulation of readability, of iterability, is the circulation of a  deviation and of autobiography as always already the auto­ biography of the other.5  Or, in still other terms, one could say  that there is autobiography of a "we" given by the division, the  deviation, and the sharing of voices. With these terms, I am  trying to translate the title page of Jean-Luc Nancy's Le Partage  des voix and especially the sense of the circle it traces, which,  paradoxically, makes no sense unless it is open :  Hermeneuein names that to which every hermeneutic circle,  whether it wants to or not, is paradoxically opened insofar as it is  a circle. Opened, that is, to that alterity or that alteration of  meaning without which the identification of a meaning-the  circle's return to the same-could not even take place.  The opening of hermeneuein is in this sense the opening of  sense and to sense as other. Not to some superior, transcendent or  more original 'other' sense, but to sense itself as other, to an  alterity defining sense.6  This somewhat roundabout introduction brings me to the  circulation or sharing of voices in a work whose signature- son this notion of the "autobiography of the other, " see Derrida, in McDon­ ald, ed., The Ear of the Other, 5 0- 5  r :  "Nietzsche's signature does not take place  when he writes. He says clearly that it will take place posthumously . . . w hen  the other comes to sign with him, to join with him in alliance and, in order to do  so, to hear and understand him . . . . I n other words . . . i t is the ear of the other  that signs. The ear of the other says me to me and constitutes the autos of my  autobiography. When, much later, the other will have perceived with a keen­ enough ear what I will have addressed or destined to him or her, then my  signature will have taken place.

" When I say "one should not, " you  of course already understand that it is I who am in no rush to do  so, in part for the principal reasons I have just outlined but also  no doubt for more obscure, even autobiographical reasons that I  would share if I could.  To hear the deviation in Baudelaire's voice, not so as to tax  him (or anyone else ) with it, or to pretend to heal it over, but  rather to share in its address and perhaps to readdress it: this  will require activating the silent pole of a dialogue, taking up a  position that, at first and even second glance, will not appear  very promising. But I promise at least to return to what is  promising, even if the route may not be exactly circular.  In 1 8 5 61 an observer of the Parisian literary scene who wanted to illustrate Baudelaire's eccentricity reported that the poet  regularly insisted on reading his verses to "his young Creole  mistress . "  "The lady, " remarked the observer, "does not find  this diet to her taste and from time to time revolts against her  lover's tyranny. 'Just hold your tongue, ' he answers, throwing  five francs at her. 'I know you're a silly goose, but I need to read  my verses aloud and I insist on their being heard. ' "7 In a note,  Claude Pichois, editor of Les Fleurs du mal, refers this piece of  gossip to one of the poems ( "Sonnet d'automne") ,  at a point  where, precisely, the poet directs an abrupt "Tais-toi ! "  ( Shut  up ! )  to an inquiring feminine figure. The point the editor seems  to be making with his reference is that, regardless of the anec­ dote's authenticity, Baudelaire at least fueled his own legend  when he staged this moment in the poem, the moment at  which the poet tells a woman to shut up and listen.8 What is  more, Pichois also implies that the anecdote accurately reflects  Baudelaire's contempt not only for Jeanne Duval, his illiterate  7Quoted by the editor in Oeuvres completes ( Paris, 1 97 5 ) , 1 : 948 ;  all further  references will be included in the text.  8If indeed this is Pichois's point, it is not particularly well taken about  "Sonnet d'automne, " where a question put to the poet is put off because it is too  probing rather than too stupid. The remark would have been better placed as a  note to the "Taisez-vous" of "Semper Eadem, " which is discussed below.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 1 2 8  I No O n e  Signs for the Other  companion of many years, but for women in general. The im­ plication is clear when, without transition or comment, Pichois  simply juxtaposes to the anecdote the following quote from  Mon Coeur mis a nu, just one of many he might have chosen  from that text to illustrate its author's categorical disdain: "I  have always been amazed that women are allowed to enter  churches. What conversation could they possibly have with  God ? "  With that gesture, Pichois, inadvertently perhaps, in­ vites every woman to put herself in the place of Jeanne Duval  when confronted with Baudelaire's verses. That is, every  woman should hear herself addressed by "Shut up, silly goose,  and listen. " Taceat mulier in ecclesiam.  It might seem that the place of such an addressee is the least  promising position from which to hear or read this poetry. Yet if  that is so, then it would be not so much because it is the place of  nonreaders like Jeanne Duval ( or any of the Fleurs du mal's  other mistresses ) but rather because these addressees are curi­ ously positioned by a kind of double gesture that the anecdote  neatly brings out. What Jeanne Duval was ordered to listen to  over her objections were poems that, very often, included a  form of address to some feminine figure. That is, she had to sit  still for the address of this address, for a doubled address that, on  both levels, talks, so to speak, over her head.9 However, one  assumes perhaps too quickly that her impatience with this  maneuver can only be a sign of her dull imperviousness to  Baudelaire's verse. One assumes, that is, that no link is possible  9"A postrophes are embarrassing, " writes Jonathan Culler in "Reading Lyric, "  Yale French Studies 69 ( 1 9 8 5 ), 99, an article that is very helpful in elucidating  Paul de Man's reflections on Baudelaire's  lyric in "Anthropomorphism and  Trope in the Lyric, " in Rhetoric of Romanticism . De Man also notes the  embarrassment of apostrophe when he remarks about the opening stanza of  "Obsession" :  "We are all frightened by windy woods but do not generally make  a spectacle of ourselves talking to trees" ( 2 5 5 ) . Culler, particularly, suggests  that absurdity or embarrassment may help explain why apostrophe is so often  neglected by readers, leaving relatively untouched its trope of anthropomor­ phism, whose workings de Man is concerned to lay out. The point, however,  would be that anthropomorphism is better hidden but no less at work when  apostrophe seems "reasonable, " when, that is, it is another talking creature,  rather than woods, that is being addressed. Indeed, the violence that may be  implied or entailed is all the more effective by appearing more reasonable.  </page> <page sequence="9"> Baudelaire au feminin I 1 2 9   between her exasperation in  this situation and an understand­ ing of the poems which would be more than just a passive  hearing of them. But what if Jeanne Duval's naive petulance  were also the sign that just such a link has and should be made  between the address in the poems and their address to an un­ willing listener? Who, in fact, can say that Jeanne Duval has not  understood what she heard? lO  Jeanne, of course, supplies raw material for a Baudelairean  thematics of woman-woman in the raw. Yet, as Michel Deguy  has pointed out, woman figures as a theme in Baudelaire only  because she is first what he calls the poem's milieu, its me­ dium, that by which it names and measures the appearance of  whatever appears . In his article "Le Corps de Jeanne, " Deguy  writes :   For Baudelaire, woman i s  the Pascalian body; or, in terms of  poetics, she is the oxymoron . . . .  She-or he/it = her body-is  the milieu in the sense of the division between high and low,  converter of high and low into one another. She can operate this  distension and this exchange by being herself aggrandized or made  smaller. But first one must pass by way of her in order to see : her  microcosmic unfurling gives the measure, the scale of refer­ ence. I I  To call Jeanne a milieu is to place her at the heart of the poetic  operation. And indeed it is to the operation of the word sein­ breast or bosom, but by metaphor or metonymy also heart- 10The initial reporter in the 1 8 5 6  journal article, Raymond de Breilh, betrays  what may itself be a kind of nai:ve understanding of Jeanne's nai:ve-or at least  unformulated- understanding. When he writes that "la dame ne trouve pas le  regime a son gout" ( the lady does not find this diet to her taste), his language  suggests that this situation of address is to be compared to a forced feeding. The  metaphor may even have prompted the use of the epithet "goose, " which,  besides having connotations of silliness and femininity (is it because geese are  monogamous ? ), is also regularly subjected in the French countryside to gavage,  or forced feeding. In any case, the image of the violent or at least unwelcome  address implies a kind of interiorization when it likens listening (or reading) to  eating. Although it's too early to judge, the comparison to interiorization may  be telling more than it means to say about the violence of address.  1 1Deguy, "Le Corps de Jeanne, " Poetique 3 ( 1 970) ,  3 3 8 .   </page> <page sequence="10"> 13 0 I No One Signs for the Other  that Deguy turns his attention. This move is completely con­ sistent with the poems' own working through of these rhetori­ cal possibilities, which Deguy draws out subtly and surely. I  wonder, however, whether it is not almost too consistent, too  closely joined with the movement it is tracing or describing, to  be able to remark, rather than just repeat, all that may be at  work here, including certain resistances . Deguy's term milieu,  when taken in the sense of poetic medium, may also name a  point of resistance that has been assumed uncritically or un­ knowingly by the commentary. To call Jeanne or woman the  poetic medium is to implicate her with the poem's language or  speech. Yet the body with which Deguy finds Baudelaire con­ cerned is often rendered speechless.  What I want to begin to explore is this silencing that gives  voice to the poem. Silencing and not simply silence. Indeed,  only the difference between an unequivocal absence of speech  and a silencing of speech can make it potentially interesting to  sit up and listen when feminine figures are made to speak in  Baudelaire's poems. Because they are made to speak all through  Les Fleurs du mal, as we shall see. The point, then, is not that  this medium is a speechless body but that its speaking in the  poem and by the poem is stamped by a kind of equivocation or  double gesture : both a giving and a taking away of voice. 1 2  Les Fleurs du mal opens, in fact, with two women screeching  to the heavens their intentions to make the Poet suffer. Such an  opening scene sets up a kind of sounding board against which  many of the voices of Les Fleurs du mal resonate. First, even  before the Poet speaks for himself, "Benediction, " the initial  poem, cites the speech of the Poet's mother. In a caricatural  parody of the Virgin Mother, her invective invokes God to call  down a curse and a blight on the son who is her punishment for  unnamed crimes. 13 Next, the opening poem invokes the Poet's  1 2Barbara Johnson has also noticed that "something strange soon happens"  when Baudelaire's verse addresses a feminine figure and gets her to talk. See  "Apostrophe, Animation, and Abortion, " Diacritics 1 6  ( Spring 1 986 ), esp. 30- 3 I .   1 3This is the first and last time in Les Fleurs du mal that the word "mere" is  employed in its primary, biological sense. Sima Godfrey, however, has argued  </page> <page sequence="11"> Baudelaire au feminin I r 3 r  woman-"Sa femme va criant sur les places publiques"14- who vows to usurp the place of  divine honor in his heart, then  to rip it from his chest and throw it to her dog. "Benediction"  concludes with the Poet in his own voice humbly thanking God  for the suffering he has endured at the hands of all humanity,  represented principally by the speech of mother and mistress.  The figures of feminine voice or voice attributed to feminine  figures are numerous and diverse enough to require a much  longer study if one were to propose an exhaustive census of  them all . Such a study, moreover, would have to set out a sure  and decisive criterion for distinguishing among the poems' dif­ ferent voices, for establishing where one ends and another be­ gins, in order to enumerate all those that the Poet attributes or  lends to feminine figures .  I suspect that such a criterion will  always finally elude the most patient research, and, what is  more, it may be precisely because the criterion allowing one to  distinguish one voice from another is in default that conven­ tional solutions risk being too easily welcomed to take its  place. i s Any procedure for separating out a feminine voice or  voices in Les Fleurs du mal has to consider the possibility that  there is a defensive component to its reaction in the face of a  mixed voice, a middle voice, or even a doubled and undecidable  voice, a voice that both is and is not the Poet's own, that both is  and is not the voice of an addressee, destinataire, or interlocu­ tor. It may be that unless one suspends as far as possible this  persuasively that the "mere des souvenirs" is a figure close to the source of  Baudelaire's lyricism and should also be read literally; see " 'Mere des sou­ venirs ' :  Baudelaire, Memory, and Mother, " L 'Esprit Createur 2 5 (2 ) .   14"His woman goes screeching through the public squares ." All translations  from Les Fleurs du ma] are my own and are meant only to give a sense of the  rhetorical patterns that are the focus of the readings proposed here . The specific­ ity of these patterns tends to disappear in the published translations.  1 5This could explain why, for example, one could propose to speak of "di­ alogue" in these poems and then be forced to recognize that one of the di­ alogue's interlocutors is almost always silent. Russell S .  King, in "Dialogue in  Baudelaire's Poetic Universe, " L 'Esprit Createur 1 3 ( 2 ), writes : "Dialogue . . . i s  here defined as that portion of a poem contained between inverted commas,  representing the conversational element. Usually only the addresser's speech is  present, with the addressee remaining silent" I I I 5 ).  </page> <page sequence="12"> 1 3 2 I No One Signs for the Other  defensive reaction, one has no chance to determine how it is  working within the poetry itself, no chance to hear what sounds  like a wound in a voice trying to heal itself by expelling or  expressing the instrument of its injury. The question, however,  is whether this impossible expression is not precisely what  gives the Poet his voice .  One thinks, for example, of these lines  from "L'Heautontimoroumenos" (The self-tormentor) :   Elle est clans ma voix, la criarde!  C'est tout mon sang, ce poison noir!  Je suis le sinistre miroir  Ou la megere se regarde.  Je suis la plaie et le couteau !  Je suis le soufflet et la joue !  Je suis les membres et la roue,  Et la victime et le bourreau ! 1 6 The shrill "elle" who is "clans ma voix" does not refer to the  woman who presumably is addressed by the poem's first line,  "Je te frapperai sans colere" ( I  will strike you without anger) ,   but rather to voracious Irony, "la vorace Ironie, " of the stanza  preceding the ones cited. "Elle" is but an allegorization that  takes advantage of grammatical gender to turn Irony into a  shrew. 1 7 Likewise, all the images of ironic doubling in the final  lines confront masculine- with feminine-gendered nouns . The  voice of gender has thus been extended well beyond the appar­ ent limits of woman's or man's speech. At the very least, these  lines thematize the obstacle that would confront the attempt to  separate different voice strands from each other along some  dividing line between genders .  Still, there are poems in Les Fleurs du mal, indeed many of  them, that represent some feminine or feminized speaker. If,  1 6She is in my voice, this screeching one ! I All my blood is this black poison! I  I am the sinister glass I In which the shrew looks at herself. I I am the wound  and the knife ! I I am the slap and the cheek! I I am the limbs and the wheel, I  The victim and the executioner!  1 7"Elle est dans ma voix" might be called a parasitical or inverted pros­ opopoeia since, instead of lending voice to the figure of Irony, the poet's own  voice is here infiltrated and taken over by "la criarde. "   </page> <page sequence="13"> Baudelaire au feminin I r 3 3  however, one insists on the strictest criteria for determining  what constitutes represented speech, then such poems would  have to be counted as rare . 1 8 And even where one encounters  what seems to be a dialogue that puts in play a woman's speech  or voice, one can never dismiss the possibility that a defensive  dissimulation or projection of the ironic doubling featured in  "L'Heautontimoroumenos" may be at work. The opening of  the sonnet "Semper Eadem, " for example, which appears to be a  question put to the Poet by his mistress, should perhaps be read  as already a displacement out of the echo chamber of self­ questioning. Yet the fact that the poem adopts at the outset the  device of another, feminine speaker remains interesting if for  no other reason than that this voice is invoked only to be  silenced.  This sonnet opens with the citation of a question put to the  Poet by a mistress in what we must imagine to be a light,  perhaps even a mocking tone. The first six lines then articulate  the pair question/answer with another pair : joy/pain.  "D'ou vous vient, disiez-vous, cette tristesse etrange,  Qui monte comme la mer sur le roe noir et nu? "   -Quand notre coeur a fait une fois sa vendange,  Vivre est un mal . C'est un secret de tous connu,  Une douleur tres simple et non mysterieuse,  Et, comme votre joie, eclatante pour tous . 1 9   1 sconsider, for example, the poem "Confession, " about which Jean Prevost  remarks : "This is more or less the only time in Baudelaire's whole opus that the  beloved woman is treated as a thinking being ."  Baudelaire (Paris, 1 9 5 3 ) 205 . The poem stages the scene of a courtesan (Mme Sabatier is usually taken1  to be  the model ) confessing to the Poet a despair that, as a woman of the world, she  must keep hidden. The eleven lines of this confession are between inverted  commas and are specifically attributed to her voice (rather than to her eyes, for  example ), more precisely, to a dissonant note in her voice. Yet the syntax of the  quoted lines indicates indirect rather than direct discourse and thus effects a  curious mixing of reporting and reported voices, of addresser and addressee :  "Pauvre ange, elle chantait, votre note criarde : I 'Que rien ici-bas n'est certain, I  Et que toujours . . . 1  1 1 (Poor dear, your grating note sang: I "That nothing here below is certain, I And that  always . . . " ) .  1 9"From where, you were saying, does this strange sadness come over you, I  Rising like the sea onto the black and naked rock? "  I -Once the heart has had  its harvest, I Living is an evil .  It's a secret that everyone knows, I A very simple  and unmysterious pain, I And, like your joy, obvious to everyone.  </page> <page sequence="14"> 1 3 4  I No One Signs for the Other  That a pain is said to be like a joy because both are "eclatante  pour tous" might seem to be an abuse of metaphor until one  begins to suspect that the forced resemblance is a kind of cover  thrown over what is actually a metonymic relation of cause and  effect between the terms. That is, the questioner's joy does not  resemble the Poet's pain; it inflicts that pain. The point of their  exchange, the place where both of them burst out, is clearly  named in the next stanza with another metonymy: the wom­ an's mouth. It is her childishly laughing mouth, her "bouche au  rire enfantin, " that the poem twice commands to be silent with  a repetition of "taisez-vous" on either side of the sonnet's prin­ cipal division:  Cessez done de chercher, 6 belle curieuse!  Et, bien que votre voix soit douce, taisez-vous !   Taisez-vous, ignorante ! ame toujours ravie !  Bouche au rire enfantin ! Plus encor que la Vie,  La Mort nous tient souvent par des liens subtils .   Laissez, laissez mon coeur s'enivrer du mensonge,  Plonger dans vos beaux yeux comme dans un songe,  Et sommeiller longtemps a l 'ombre de VOS cils ! 20  The imperative command "taisez-vous" makes way for the  gentler imperative of the final stanza : "Laissez, laissez mon  coeur, " and so on, which brings the poem to a close with what is  the most characteristic-not to say obsessive-of all attitudes  in the face of the feminine figures mustered in the pages of Les  Fleurs du mal : the Poet dreamily drinking in to the point of  drunkenness the light (or shadow) of her eyes. "Semper Eadem"  is interesting in this regard because it installs the dreamy atti­ tude only after imposing silence on the woman's childlike  20so stop looking, o beautiful, curious one ! I And, even though your voice is  sweet, be quiet ! I Be quiet, ignorant one ! Always ecstatic soul ! I Childishly  laughing mouth ! Even more than Life, I Death often has a subtle hold on us.

Her question, in effect, betrays a forgetting, and as such  it marks a return to the child's ignorance of the simplest truth :  Death has a better hold on us than Life . This poem, therefore,  not only situates the poet's dreaming in the woman's eyes but  locates them as a displacement of her mouth "au rire enfantin, 1 1   a displacement that is a forgetting or a repressing of her forget­ ting.  If, however, the movement traced from mouth to eyes and  from speaking to dreaming is one that goes toward a forgetting,  then what exactly is so painful about the woman's question,  which, as I said, betrays a forgetting? One answer might be that,  precisely, it betrays forgetfulness, that is, it is a reminder of  what one wants to forget, whereas forgetting only works when  one forgets that one is forgetting. But the poem perhaps gives  another hint of what is so painful in this woman's happy or  mocking question. Since it is said that the two states-pain and  joy, but also remembering and forgetting-are linked by the  fact of their being "eclatante pour taus, " there may be a veiled  reproach in this image of indiscriminate jouissance made avail­ able or promised to anyone.2 1 These two motifs of reproach that  fuel the repetition of "taisez-vous" can moreover be joined if  one understands the woman's question as betraying her lack of  memory and therefore the likelihood of her future infidelity.  The mensonge italicized in the last stanza would be a lie,  then, about the woman's memory. Specifically, it covers over  her forgetfulness, which always threatens to give the Poet a  preview of his own death or an advance taste of his own disap­ pearance for the other, in the eyes of the other. No sooner does  she open her mouth than the poet is reminded of the world of  others to which she belongs by her speech, almost as if she had  spoken only in order to welcome a throng of partygoers into the  privacy of their lovers ' chamber. The intrusion, however,  comes less from others than from the otherness of the woman  2 1Besides some thematic parallels with 1 1Semper Eadem, 1 1  the poem 11A Celle  qui est trop gaie1 1  (To her who is too gay) suggests yet another displacement of  the laughing, mocking mouth to 1 1ces levres nouvelles I Plus eclatantes et plus  belles1 1  ( these novel lips I More striking and more beautiful) which the Poet  dreams of opening in the woman's flank.  </page> <page sequence="16"> 1 3 6 I No One Signs for the Other  that speaks a separation of their voices, their memories, their  bodies, and their deaths.22 It is this separation, this difference,  and this otherness that the lie is called upon to dissimulate,  although obviously it cannot do so very satisfactorily. The  italics situate both an emphatic will to override or faire taire  difference and, by a gesture that has to call attention to itself, a  reminder of precisely the difference the Poet wants to forget .  If one were to plot further this conjunction of lying, memory,  the Poet's death, and woman, a point adjacent to "Semper  Eadem" would have to be the poem titled "L'Amour du men­ songe, " where all these terms are laid out in a similar way.23  Since, however, it contains no explicit instance of a feminine  figure made to speak and/ or be silent, the latter poem risks  diverting us from our primary concern. Still, two of this poem's  metaphors can provide a brief but useful transition from the  suppression of feminine speech in "Semper Eadem" to the un­ silencing of feminine voice in Baudelaire at which we are trying  to arrive.  The poem is a long question about a woman's memory and  the reliability of its signs . Eyes, even the most melancholic  eyes, may deceive one into thinking that they contain precious  secrets when in fact they resemble lockets without relics,  "medaillons sans reliques" (1. 1 9 ) .  This image makes explicit  the two senses of memory which were already crossing and  getting confused in "Semper Eadem. "  The souvenir locket  meant to keep safe relics of the dead-a miniature portrait, a  lock of hair-figures at once the faculty of memory and that   which memory remembers or, as  we tend to  say, contains. I t  is  her memory of him, his memory in her, a pocket of internaliza­ tion but worn on the outside as a reminder of her memory of  him, his memory in her-an external reminder to interiorize  the other, to keep him alive in memory, to keep his memory  22See Deguy for a superb reading of "La Mort des amants, " a poem that  fantasizes the simultaneous death of the lovers .  23The fact that the two poems were first published together in the same issue  of a journal (Revue Contemporaine, 1 5  May 1 860)  before they were both in­ cluded in the second, 1 8 6 1  edition of Les Fleurs du mal suggests a renvoi  between the lie in the one and the other.  </page> <page sequence="17"> Baudelaire au feminin I 1 3 7  alive.24 That the locket may be purely decorative, containing  nothing of significance, that "medaillons" and "reliques" re­ main dissociable within the very metonymy that associates  them, leads the poet once again to embrace rather unconvin­ cingly the lie with which metaphor promises a more reassuring  assimilation of one term by the other. As in "Semper Eadem, "  eyes as pure appearance, silent melancholic eyes, are thus pre­ ferred to any knowledge of what those eyes may or may not  conceal . To attain this knowledge, to open the locket and gain  access to the woman's memory, would require that she first  open her mouth; it requires, that is, that she be desired to speak  and desired as speaking rather than just appearing. But this  poem, which concludes with the line "Masque ou decor, salut !  J 'adore ta beaute, "25 has silenced even the silencing that in­ stalls the theater of feminine decoration.  Yet an earlier line in the poem will have warned the reader  not to take this final cavalier dismissal of uncertainty too se­ riously. It occurs in the fourth stanza, which poses a series of  metaphors for the woman's memory, the faculty of containing  and holding the Poet's memory. One of these metaphors, more  than the rest, brings out the container I contained topos of disso­ ciable difference and, in effect, bars the flight into self-delusion  which the Poet seems so eager to take. The line asks : "Es-tu  vase funebre attendant quelques pleurs" ( 1 .  1 4 )1 26 a question that, because it asks about a future, promptly leaves the realm  of truth or lying conceived as a system of correspondences or  signs. It asks in effect: Will you hold my memory? and it is thus  the sort of question that cannot be answered by a corresponding  yes or no but only by a promise. This poem would thus suggest  another understanding of the Baudelairean figure of the mourn- 241n "Getting Versed: Reading Hegel with Baudelaire, " Cynthia Chase ana­ lyzes the poetic process with reference to memory in the two senses that Hegel  distinguishes : Erinnerung, interiorizing remembrance, and Gediichtnis, think­ ing memory, but also the rote memorization of signs. Decomposing Figures:  Rhetorical Readings in the Romantic Tradition (Baltimore, 1 986 )1 u 3-38 .  It  may be possible to read the poems concerned with the faculty of woman's  memory as thematizing in effect an attempted suppression of Gediichtnis so as  to preserve Erinnerung from potential erosion by exteriority, the other's speech.  25Mask or decoration, greetings ! I adore your beauty.  26Are you a funeral urn waiting for some tears.  </page> <page sequence="18"> r 3 8 I No One Signs for the Other  ing woman. She is a figure for the melancholic poet-a "soul­ mate, " as one critic puts it27-but the identification would be  based less on resemblance than on a wished-for promise of  remembrance .  She is, in other words, a desired container or  preserver of the Poet's memory.2s  Both "Semper Eadem" and "L'Amour du mensonge" sup­ press, in different ways, the other voice that at the same time  they call up or call for. Each concludes with an attempt to cover  over or dismiss the difference that has been evoked, yet neither  can do so satisfactorily. But "L'Amour du mensonge" at least  leaves room in its margin for the feminine addressee to speak in  a way-the promise-that may not fall back immediately onto  the stage of emptied appearances . What of this other voice that  is not to be heard even if the Poet's own voice can be heard  calling for it?   If  one looks elsewhere in Les Fleurs du mal for promising  women's voices, the most insistent examples are negative ei­ ther because they are threats rather than promises, such as the  27Richard Stamelman, "The Shroud of Allegory: Death, Mourning, and Mel­ ancholy in Baudelaire's Work, " Texas Studies of Literature and Language 2 5 (3 I,  3 9 5 .  Like other treatments of Baudelaire and mourning, Stamelman draws on  Walter Benjamin's analysis of widowhood as an allegory for the condition of  modem, urban life. Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Age of High Cap­ italism, trans .  Harry Zohn (London, 1 97 3 j .   28A more detailed reading o f  this poem would have t o  begin b y  correcting a  frequent mistake concerning the lie that has to be sustained. This is not the lie  of the woman's beauty in spite of her age. If anything, it is precisely the contrary  that is asserted, since only the suggestions of her maturity can offer an apparent  support for the desired illusion of a massive memory-"Le souvenir massif"  (I. 10 )-which is said to crown her. Baudelaire, in fact, may have been the first  misreader of his poem, as the initial version carried an epigraph from Athalie  ( later deleted I which pointed to age as what had to be dissimulated: "Meme elle  avait encor cet eclat emprunte I Dant elle eut soin de peindre et d'omer son  visage I Pour reparer des ans !'irreparable outrage" ( She even had still that  borrowed bloom I With which she was careful to paint and decorate her face I So  as to repair the irreparable outrage of time I .  Sima Godfrey's reading, although it  does not refer to this poem, enforces the link between the mourning woman and  the container by placing the period of Mme Baudelaire 's mourning at the matrix  of the melancholic fantasy. Of this period, Baudelaire writes to his mother :  "Mais j 'etais toujours vivant en toi; tu etais uniquement a moi" (But I was still  living in you; you were uniquely minel ;  cited by Godfrey, 3 5 .   </page> <page sequence="19"> Baudelaire au feminin I 1 3 9   vows made by mother and mistress in "Benediction" to humili­ ate and destroy the Poet, or else because they are empty, false  promises. This latter category would be headed by the Siren­ like promises in "Les Metamorphoses du vampire" spoken by  the vampire woman, who, once she has had her fill of lovemak­ ing, appears first as a bag of pus and next as a pile of bones .  It  may be, however, that it is not so much to a promise made in  the poem that one has to be attentive, but precisely to that  which no poem can represent of itself: the promise to keep the  poem's voice in memory and to keep giving it voice. Voices  represented, attributed, or assumed in the poem can, in the best  of cases, give one to hear or understand-in French, elles  laisseraient entendre-the absent voice, the absence in the  voice marking the place of the promise-and the place of the  other.  One late poem from Les Epaves puts a promise in its title:  "Les Promesses d'un visage" (The promises of a face ) .  It is one of  the least noticed of any poem now figuring in the complete  works .29 Most of its twenty lines are speech attributed to a  woman's eyes according to the familiar prosopopoeia. Although  this device seems to situate the poem steadfastly in the realm of  promising appearances that may always be deceiving, there is­ how to say it ?-a ring of truth to these promises which moves  the composition closer to the edge of the visible stage and to  what might be called off-voice, to the other who has yet to enter  or has already left the theatrical realm of the visible.

"  This initial conjunction of shadowy eyebrows and  dark eyes states the nonfunereal principle that will be repeated  several times : an accord or agreement that is a repetition which  owes nothing either to metaphorical resemblance or to a me­ tonymy of container I contained. These eyes are not windows  into some interiority, and thus they do not evoke a lost time or a  hidden place. They are rather nothing more (or less ) than points  301 love, pale beauty, your lowered eyebrows, I From which shadows seem to  flow; I Your eyes, although very black, inspire me with thoughts I That are not  in the least funereal .

"   3 1These "sourcils surbaisses" led George Heard Hamilton t o  wonder whether  Baudelaire's "pale beaute" was not also Manet's "Chanteuse des rues, " since,  when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1 863 ,  the painting drew hoots from one  critic for what he took to be eyebrows on either side of the bridge of the figure's  nose. See Manet and His Critics (New York, 1 969 ), 40, n. 4.  </page> <page sequence="21"> Baudelaire au feminin I r4r   of  articulation on a differentiated surface that is  not a surface covering or hiding something else. The principle of simple ac­ cord is stated directly in the second stanza, which also transfers  voice to the other's eyes :  Tes yeux, qui sont  d'accord avec tes noirs cheveux,  Avec ta criniere elastique,  Tes yeux, languissamment, me disent :  What these eyes will call their "veracite" is nothing other than  the posing side by side-the accord-of different features with­ out any claims made about their sense in some larger signifying  whole. No relations of signification are claimed to exist be­ tween any of the parts : both the metaphoric and metonymic  principles, resemblance and contiguity, have been emptied of  their sense-making potential . These eyes promise, but they do  not promise a future meaning. They promise, rather, only to go  on promising.  The prosopopoeia, the eyes' speech, begins :  . . . " Si tu veux,  Amant de la muse plastique,  "Suivre l'espoir qu'en toi nous avons excite,  Et tous les gouts que tu professes,  Tu pourras constater notre veracite,  Depuis le nombril jusqu'aux fesses . "   The relation between the eyes and the lower torso i s  articulated  here like a sign: the one pointing to the other and arousing an  expectation. The expectation is answered, however, in a mark­ edly circular form: "Tu pourras constater notre veracite I  Depuis le nombril jusqu'aux fesses . "  If the eyes can be said to  point to-or promise-the lower torso, then it is because the  lower torso points to the eyes' veracity in appearing to point to  the torso and so forth. Each feature promises the other with a  kind of redundancy that is perfectly stable because it keeps  turning in a circle. Other features can be brought into the pie- </page> <page sequence="22"> 142 I No One Signs for the Other  ture in the next stanza without substantial alteration to this  pattern.  Only the final two lines seem to make a gesture off in another  direction:  "Tu trouveras . . .   Une riche toison qui, vraiment, est la soeur  De cette enorme chevelure,  Souple et frisee, et qui t 'egale en epaisseur,  Nuit sans etoiles, Nuit obscure ! "   D o  these last lines promise an equivalent or a substitute for the  depth of night? If so, then the eyes' speech breaks with its own  principle of veracity, its pattern of nonsubstitution and non­ totalization. It would thereby come very close to echoing the  sort of promise made by the vampire before she undergoes her  metamorphoses. She says : "Je remplace, pour qui me voit nue et  sans voiles, I La lune, le soleil, le ciel et les etoiles . 1 132 "Les Promesses d'un visage" may be hiding another face of the vam­ pire.  One detail of these concluding lines we have yet to mention.  At the same moment at which the eyes' discourse falls into  promising the moon and the stars, it also turns to address the  dark night: "et qui t'egale en epaisseur, I Nuit sans etoiles, Nuit  obscure ! "  What difference, if any, does this detail of address  make in the promising structure of the poem?  The answer lies in a deep fold along which the poem opens  and closes like a mouth or an eye, its two lips or lids joining and  parting. The final apostrophe to dark night is spoken by the dark  eyes, which are themselves made to speak by apostrophe and  prosopopoeia of darkness.  Thus the final apostrophe restates  the initial one : the poem's lower edge meets and joins its upper  one in a circulation for which there is no end in sight and no  promise of final meaning. Specifically, it cannot be said that the  poem's initial voice, attributed to the poet, contains or encloses  32For whoever sees me naked and without my veils, I take the place of I The  moon, the sun, the sky and the stars.  </page> <page sequence="23"> Baudelaire au feminin I 143  the other voice, atributed to a woman's eyes. Rather, the meet­ ing or joining of the two voices makes of each the other's  container and contained. Each holds the memory of the other  and promises its return. This is its ring of truth.  One could ask, finally, why this poem has received so little  critical notice. I am tempted at least to wonder whether readers  have not always sensed something distinctly un-Baudelairean  in the voice which, once invoked, takes over the poem. I am  thinking of what could be called its flatness, the fact that it  remains on the surface and exposes the superficial relation not  only of the signs it speaks but of the very sign that it is assumed  to be by the Poet's address. This flatness is something quite  different from the depth of those eyes in "L'Amour du men­ songe, " which may be "plus vides, plus profonds que vous­ memes, 6 Cieux. "33 In "Les Promesses d'un visage, " the tran­ scendent, celestial backdrop drops away and with it the promise  of metaphor's final revelation, its corps mis a nu. And this  despite the central topos of the striptease, which has been not  so much turned inside out as turned back on the spectator,  mocking the "amant de la muse plastique. "  The mocking tone  is to be heard in the distinctly prosaic line "Tu pourras consta­ ter notre veracite, " as well as in the interjected "vraiment, " a  mocking that aims at the Poet's predilection for the lie of meta­ phor, for women who are like decorative souvenir lockets or for  eyes whose dark depths seem to promise that of night. When  this very Baudelairean figure is invoked, therefore, in the last  lines, has it not been taken over and exposed in its turn as a lie  imposed by a willing blindness? And thus, is it even possible  still to hear it in Baudelaire's "own" voice ?  One may want to make these questions go away and, along  with them, the noninteriorizable other who, I am suggesting,  has somehow managed to get out in this poem. One may, that  is, want to conclude that the mockery is simply self-inflicted or  calculated and thus recuperable to what is being mocked. To do  so, however, would be to seal off Baudelaire 's signature, to  33Emptier, deeper than yourselves, 0 Heavens.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 144 I No One Signs for the Other  make it finally, for us, today, unreadable. If, on the other hand,  it is precisely the recuperative or totalizing power of any one  voice that has been given the lie in this poem, then an opening  still remains and a chance for readdress, even- who knows ?­ for redress. In  the end, this belying effect cannot be made in any  simple sense internal to the lie's calculation. Some other voice  will have had its say in "Les Promesses d'un visage. "  If this  voice promises a return and lends to the poem its ring of truth, it  is because of the deviation imposed or inflicted on the circqlar  return of the same by the other. The only sense of this circle  comes from the opening onto the sense of the other, the sharing,  dividing of voice.  </page> </plain_text>
