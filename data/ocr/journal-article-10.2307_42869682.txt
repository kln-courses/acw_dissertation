Parfois, dans la recherche contemporaine, l'étude des symboles doit céder le pas à la réalité. C'est ce qui advint lors d'une étude sur la chasse à la baleine chez les Inupiat de Point Hope, Alaska; la baleine s'impose à l'ethnographe comme esprit plutôt que symbole, comme pour les Inupiat eux-mêmes. Ainsi, lors de la chasse et des célébrations qui l'entourent, la relation entre les Inupiat et la baleine devint le premier centre d'intérêt. Fondamentalement, il faut traiter la baleine avec certains égards pour que la chasse soit un succès. A un niveau plus profond, un ensemble de rituels donne accès à la dimension religieuse de la baleine. Dans une étude de ce type, l'ethnographe laisse tomber les explications réductionnistes chères aux anthropologues et perçoit plutôt son travail comme une tâche de co-expérience et de traduction littérale. Abstract: The Whale Decides: Eskimos' and Ethnographer's Shared Consciousness on the Ice. Sometimes in contemporary social research symbology will give way to actuality, and this was the case in a study of the whale hunt among the Eskimos of Point Hope, Alaska, where for the ethnographer the whale did not impinge so much as a symbol or representation but more as a spirit, just as the Inupiat maintained. Because of this, during the hunt and its celebrations the relationship between Inupiat and whale took on a sharp focus. Basically, good manners towards the whale were essential for successful hunting. Furthermore, a world of ritual unfolded at a deeper level which gave to the people knowledge and experience of the religious dimension of the whale. In such a study the ethnographer abdicates from the anthropologists' claim to reductionist explanations and instead looks at her task as an exercise in co-experiencing and in literal translation. Introduction When I conducted anthropological research among the Inupiat Eskimos of Point Hope, Northern Alaska, I participated as whaling crew member in the role of cook. This practical task was ideal for the business of ethnography since the quickest way to the heart of even unfamiliar people is through their stomachs. Yet my paper is about the * University of Virginia, Department of Anthropology, Charlottesville, VA 22906-9024, USA. ÉTUDES/INUIT/STUDIES, 1990, 14 (1-2): 39-52</page><page sequence="2">spirituality and consciousness of the whale. The paper depicts scene after scene, mostly to do with food, in which the all-penetrating consciousness and awareness of the whale (our food) came out in its full dimensions. It can already be seen that I espouse the Eskimos' own viewpoint (as against that of incoming officials and missionaries), thus detaching myself also from many anthropologists' views because I cannot claim to higher knowledge than is found in the Eskimos' (or anyone's) own religion. Furthermore I do not treat of the historic past of the Eskimos but allow the contemporary scene its own validity, instead of resurrecting a scenario of superseded beliefs systems for the sake of a structural analysis. It has to be faced that studies in the symbolic anthropology of animals are "inadequate" (Walens 1986: 296). Yet as Walens says, "animal symbols convey the deepest and most abstruse dimensions of human existence.... They may have freedoms, powers, and abilities denied to humans.... they may be the linkage between the mundaneness of everyday life and the divinity underlying the cosmos (p. 291). And he adds, "The image of the human within the animal and the animal within the human is one of the most widespread in animal symbolism" (p. 292). What is all this saying? Why are animals so special? Wild animals have a certain aura of sacredness because they are "incapable of acting immorally... they are unfettered by the chain of human custom" (p. 293). But more than this, in northern lands at least they appear to have purposes with regard to the human race. Sharp (1988) describes the sense dwelling in the Chipewyan Indians of the Northwest Territories of Canada that the caribou chooses to give itself to the hunter so long as the hunter uses his spirit faculty of inkoze to connect with the animal. This is "inverted sacrifice", as Sharp terms it. The caribou is somehow educating the human, acting purposefully to increase the level of human spirituality. Now this is a very different matter from the "do ut des " exchange theory of Tylor (1871), where the sacrificer is giving to a deity, trying to gain his attention, "giving in order that he may be given to". Here the animal is primary, the initiative rests with the animal. This is how Sharp puts it: Hunting, as a primary bridge between the non-physical aspects of the human and non- human worlds, takes on a sacrificial character in a manner somewhat alien to classical Western conceptualizations (Robertson Smith 1901, Hubert and Mauss 1964: 1-13, E. E. Evans-Pritchard 1956: 272-286; de Heusch 1985: 22-25). Animals sacrifice themselves to dene not just to maintain dene physical existence but to hold the people in contact with that other and older realm of being from which the circumstances of contemporary dene life threaten to remove them entirely (Sharp 1988). Although Hubert and Mauss defined sacrifice as a communication between the sacred and profane worlds, the victim as they saw it was not a willing one in the sense described above. In the cosmology of the Eskimos, however, the whale is a conscious, willing creature that assumes the victim's role as a creative act. This of course reminds one of Jesus' act of self-sacrifice to enable humankind to experience a similar spirituality. Seen this way, Christ's sacrifice was not a kind of economic transaction, not a kind of bargain for the souls of human beings as the church soon began to explain it, not a matter of Christ offering himself to God the Father/or us, redeeming us as if we were certificates of deposit. This smacks of the ideas of Greek and Roman slavery. But far from the markets 40/E. TURNER</page><page sequence="3">and courts we see the curious idea of the simpler hunting peoples, among whom "connectedness" was very strong, and the aim of Jesus also, who was the epitome of "connectedness", both of whom were concretizing a victim who offers himself to us , not to an outside God, to render us more spiritual. This interpretation avoids the do ut des notion, "I give in order to be given to", that is, planting an obligation upon a god figure. In this we encounter the bestowal of a further faculty on human beings, that of spirituality, short-circuiting the pains and loss of death and propelling the system on its way into new life, into reincarnation in the Eskimo case. The Eskimos knew much about ghosts and ghost helpers, death was no permanent end for them. Among "developed," settled, agricultural and industrial peoples hierarchies soon took shape. Helpless domestic animals without volition became the sacrificial animals, and a pyramid of levels was taken as the template, with animals at the bottom, human beings in the middle, and anthropomorphic gods at the top. Very soon we are drawn in to the idea of the lordship of the human being over the earth and we lose the connectedness of all things, animals, humans, spirits, rocks, and waters in one moving cosmic circling. Curiously, we are now returning to the realization that humanity's place in nature is merely one interlocking part of nature, whereas our previous hierarchical and proprietorial claims have had the effect of destroying much of nature. As for the hunters Westerners know best, the gun-law sports hunters, their perspective seems diametrically opposite to that of the Eskimos. The Western sports hunter shows his mastery over the animal, and takes a trophy as if he were the "winner" in some kind of contest. "Man" has "domination" over the animals here. While at the other extreme, Protestant theologians deplore any kind of ritual sacrifice, believing that no mere things nor animals nor human symbolic acts have an actual spiritual dimension, and arguing that we merely require to become more moral. This paper deals with the Inupiaq way - the principle of the self-sacrificial conscious animal as that principle operates in actual life. For me, newly occupied as I was with Inuit studies, the way to gain a sense of this animal power was not to delve into accounts of outworn customs and create out of them some kind of theory of my own - a paternalistic endeavor if not an imperialistic one - but to try to sense the underlying concepts as they were revealed in action, in participant anthropology. In such a milieu, ideas about "symbols", "myths", "metaphor", and even "meaning" tend to fall away; one is bathed in the enormity of the whale's existence, its most obvious awareness and knowledge of our affairs, above all its intentionality, above our feeble intentionality. Here I am clearly dealing with material that is said to be not empirically verifiable, and yet as we shall see it is experienceable. What is the difference? Empiricism, after all, is founded on what people actually experience. Radical empiricism, learning the delicate weft of complexities in living events associated for instance with a creature attributed with a spirit, may take one so much further into the heart of experience that one may even approximate the field people's own understanding of events. And now we encounter the problem of the hierarchy of authority. Within the discipline of anthropology it is usually maintained that the trained expert has a better understanding of the workings of a culture than the field subjects in it. Van der Geest in his article "Anthropologists and Missionaries: Brothers under the Skin" (1990: 591), questions this: "One could say that in most cases the anthropologist deprives religion of its original meaning and redefines it as something which is relevant and interesting within anthropological discourse," so that what makes sense to the anthropologist does not make sense to the participant in a given THE WHALE DECIDES/41</page><page sequence="4">culture. Mary Douglas is known to have commented on structuralist interpretations of the story of Noah in the Bible, "The structuralists derive from the text a different and a lesser meaning". One asks, isn't this yet another form of imperialism? If there are two kinds of logic, does the positivist one have to predominate? Point Hope is a village of about 600 people whose technology is now almost totally modernized, with the exception of the use of skin boats and manual hauling in the hunting of whales. Still, in normal years their own catches of subsistence food - whale meat, seal, walrus, caribou, fish, and other items - account for some 60% of food needs. Certain emphases in the traditional whaling procedure have shifted, mainly toward a more supportive infrastructure down on the ice, with tents, Coleman stoves, and continual supplies of food for the whale hunters. The communication between human being and whale continues, but it is not precisely "traditional". It has adapted. Inupiaq history is a story of constant change; it is what is done now that is alive now. Old ethnographies are available, it is true, works by Rasmussen (1930), Spencer (1959), Rainey (1947); and the Inupiat themselves repeat their own histories. In the manner of an antiquarian one might painstakingly identify actions performed today that show hints of the old system - while all the time a modified cosmology is operating merrily before one's eyes. It is the very reading of the ethnographies of different eras that has persuaded me that one's "time-focus" has to correspond with the era in which one operates, just because the material extant setting and the cosmology do tend to be at one, they match. And historians such as Garraghan have already begun to show this, teaching "history as actuality". The cosmology of one age does not necessarily apply to another. Inupiat are above all practical. Spirituality exists but when I was there it was that of 1988, and some of it I was able to record. If we look carefully we see that the contemporary spirituality of a culture can integrate all other cultural subsystems. It is possible that anthropologists among northern peoples have found fundamentalist Christian spirituality too embarrassing to mess with and therefore they stick to history, archeology, or economics. As for me I had to consider whether the whale's importance was symbolic or actual, and if the latter, in what sense actual. Some anthropologists are reopening the whole question of analysis. I am going a little further still. To me the questions of analysis look like these: Is the whale as caught by the Inupiat simply a zoological entity and is its hunting a prosaic, purely economic matter? Or is the whale a "symbol" or powerful "metaphor" representing sea as opposed to land, or the community, or woman, or eternal return, " illud tempus "? Or is it how the Inupiat see it, a living immortal being, not limited by what we call zoology, not representing anything, a Ding an sich ? Only narrative can carry what I am trying to say. So I shall briefly tell the tale of the 1988 whaling season at Point Hope, emphasizing when I come to them the points of communication between whale and human being - the points of consciousness of such a communication. October The first scene was in the Bingo hall and took place the October before the whaling season. It consisted of the distribution of the previous season's whale meat, actually a ritual performed to bring the new whales. 42/E. TURNER</page><page sequence="5">The whaling captain's wife stood in the middle of a wide spread of flattened cardboard, ulu knife in hand. She was the principle distributor of the hulks of whale meat brought for the whale's tail celebration to the Bingo Hall. She gave a little dance, freestyle with her arms out, very pleased - a huge woman, full of energy. When she laughed or giggled it came out in narrow sharp squeaks like the skrakky consonants of the language or the deliberate clack of the drumstick on the drum's rim. She yelled instructions at everyone, skating over the oily cardboard, dodging the enormous whale vertebrae, knife in hand, handing muktuk whale treats here, there, and everywhere1, even to me, with her husband the whaling captain standing stocky and responsible in front of the oil stove. This whale meat must be given away, then whales will come next season. They performed the "Whale's Tail giving" in March also. In this one the niece shouted to the noisy children, "Be quiet for the whale. If you're noisy he won't like it". They subsided, thinking. The reproof to the children on behalf of a conscious beast - "he won't like it" - was a teaching for the children about the whale's knowledge. January In the dark of winter my neighbor Molly told me that when the sun disappears the whaling captain's wife takes her special pot of water and goes out facing the moon. She raises the pot and asks for a whale. Then she hears a "ping" sound in her pot - a golden "ping". It is the whale saying, "I am coming to you". The woman and the whale are speaking to each other. In the approaching season the people will catch a whale. April When April came Molly was concerned about her cold storage. The cold storage was her cave-like cellar in the permafrost, down in the old village at the point. The cave was smelly, fouled with stale meat. The whale would know, he wouldn't come to a woman who had a dirty ice cellar. Molly was determined to clean it out as she always did. If everything were clean and decent the whale would see it and come. So she and I dressed in old clothes, took pickaxes on the snowmobile, and drove off to the point. Molly found her cellar and removed the trap door. We climbed down inside on a ladder of whale scapulars. The place reminded me of a sepulcher, with walls that were rounded and ancient. We spent all day hacking at old frozen slabs of whale meat. Molly, though stout, got herself into an even deeper cave going down to the right, and from there quickly tossed up blocks of fat. The smell wasn't that bad, it was familiar, a reminder of nourishment. "The whale is different said Molly. "It knows, it talks to other whales, it knows if you are a good person - it knows if there is no quarrelling. John leads the prayer for a peaceful and safe whale hunt." 1 I was able to relate the significance of these flinging actions, this generosity to the point of abandonment, to Fienup-Riordan's reference to the same gestures in her book on the Nelson Island Eskimos (1983). It is associated with the whale's spout and the generosity of nature. "If we give everything away, more will come." See also Marshall S ahi ins on a similar Athabascan principle. THE WHALE DECIDES/43</page><page sequence="6">She said all this so earnestly that it brought tears to my eyes. The whale chooses its beneficiary. It relates. If only I could put it as Molly did!2 Meanwhile the men prepared their weapons. Everything had to be absolutely clean, the wooden paddles scraped until they looked like new, the sealskin cover of the boat soaked until it was white before it was put on. For the whale can smell and see a long way. It knows. It likes to see clean white things. You feel it is somehow there in the village with you. April I saw the whale when I was on the edge of the ice on April 13. Down by the water the scene was like an estuary, all was flat, wide, quiet, and sparkling. Through binoculars the distant water in the sun's path was like millions of glittering crystals. A wide pool of water lay in front of us. The boat's stern was set on a block of ice so that it would be easy to push into the water. Ice kept forming in front of the boat, so that the young men started clearing the ice by throwing a line with a six inch hook attached to it into the water, then pulling the line back and back to break a path through the ice, making one path on each side so that a large wedge of ice could be pushed out and broken up. The ice kept forming again. We ate the stew I had brought; it was nearly cold because I had walked with it over the ice for two miles. Molly brought two thermoses of hot coffee and some doughnuts. One boat to the right of us started out after something and turned back - it was about half a mile away. The distances were great. All was glitter, flatness, and the occasional sound of snowmobiles. John stood up. He'd heard the sound of blowing. Molly saw the whale first in spite of her bad eye. John took the binoculars, then handed them to me. There was the moving thing far away in the water - a long thing. As I watched, it moved like a curling mountain, with its big bow head, its taller and taller back - now it was mostly out of the water - huge - and then sank forward. It was too far away to chase, but it was what the boat at the right had been after, with the harpooner ready at the bow. Now I knew what that forward rocking gesture meant that everyone had been making with the hand. The next day a crisis occurred. A BBC man arrived in the village with a load of equipment, intending to film the whale hunt. He came and stayed in my house, explaining that the Eskimo head of the Eskimo Whaling Commission had said I would put him up, so I had to do it. It so happened that that evening a large crowd of children came to my house for treats. I was going to turn many of them away, fearing that my landlady might not like children in her house. But Dorcus the healer who was visiting at the time said "If you shut a kid out your house the whale won't come". So I let them in and organized them to help make a potato salad for the whaling crew. Other forces were afoot however. The whole town knew that the whale did not like film making. And sure enough, the wind turned south and pushed all the ice together, jamming the open water shut. "The whales did it", Ernie said later. Ernie was one of the whaling captains, a man of Eskimo knowledge. "The whales know, they can control the wind and the weather. They have senses that are much more than the human". 2 I did not use a taperecorder or notebook in front of people except for language lessons. 44/E. TURNER</page><page sequence="7">Just at the time the wind changed I was down on the ice beside the tent. John's eldest son Ashley pointed out a large fast-moving cloud, at first seen over us, then more of it appearing to come from a long tube of cloud over Cape Thompson. Ashley said quietly, "Put the food into the grub box, get things put away". Then, "Pull those sleds out and load them". We were going to leave the ice. Ashley and Floyd took the tent down and we loaded the sleds in good order. On the way up, passing the pressure ridges, twice I saw long new cracks an inch wide. There didn't seem to be enough forces around to make those cracks - just a little wind. But something did. I found it hard to write my notes about this since I was so much involved. In addition to the fact that I had the BBC man in my house I was afraid that my moral state, my Eskimo generosity and "faith" as Ernie called it, wasn't good enough. The wind stayed south. Now Molly and John rarely talked about the whale and when they did spoke quietly. Molly went down again to her ice cellar and finished cleaning it. Then she felt better. She often went into the church to pray for whales. A few days later the BBC man got the message and left town; immediately (as my diary recorded) the wind turned north at 25 miles per hour and the water opened up again. Ernie told me later, "It was I who refused the BBC man. He would have stopped the whales coming. The water would not have opened. The minute he left, the water opened. Didn't it?" he demanded. "You call this superstition. I call it the truth". "It's the truth", I said. Here we have several hints of the whale's knowledge of our actions. It would know if I turned children out of my house; it knew there was a movie man in my house, and it possessed the power to alter the weather. Clearly the consciousness of the whale was getting to me. May Floyd said, "Over there!" Before my eyes the crew was already sliding the boat into the water and was away, paddling west. I never followed what was done, it was so quick. There did not seem to have been any splash when the boat entered the water. The thing was like a bird taking off, a single bird. Now it was here, now it wasn't. Very soon the boat was a tiny black silhouette against the dazzle path of the sun and was gone. Molly and I walked over the ice. We came to one of the many faults, a slight change of level in the frozen sea. We both stopped for a moment to take off our parkas because it was hot. Molly suddenly stood erect. Her hand went out. "Ta! Ta!. ...They've caught a whale....Ernie's caught a whale". Her hand flashed to her midriff. "And we will have the stomach share". How did she know that? "Yes. The Franksons", she said, and began to dance about and laugh with pleasure. She flung her arms around my neck. Hardly awake to the situation, I began to laugh. It was indeed the case, as we found out from our neighbors. Ernie had caught a whale, and our crew came in to help as "second boat." Many times after this when in congenial company, Molly described the scene by the ice fault, and especially the certainty that came to her that we would get the stomach share. Her hand would always flash to her midriff. "Didn't I say so, Edie?" And she would laugh. THE WHALE DECIDES/45</page><page sequence="8">This was a signalling-in of Ernie's whale; in the same way, the only whale ever caught by the crew of her own husband John was sighted and signalled-in by Molly herself - on her birthday as she often told me. At the catching of Ernie's whale it was Molly's original gesture out there on the ice that was the direct knowledge that we would have the stomach share, as if she felt it in her stomach; it was a gesture given to her by some sort of communication with the whale. There had been many watchers. It didn't have to be Ernie's whale, we didn't have to come in second. The woman's connection with the whale is shown in this episode as a state of attunement. We heard the story of the catching of Ernie's whale in bits and pieces afterwards. Ernie had never caught a whale before. His boat was old, his snowmobile was almost defunct, and he had only his brother's threewheeler ATV to rely on. His standing with assimilated Eskimos in the village was dubious because he was an Eskimo patriot3. He had been down on the edge of the ice that day, watching by an inward curve of the ice, when, a whale rose exactly in front of him. At once Ernie seized his weapon and aimed at the beast's flank. It was told that Ernie trembled - he trembled as he raised his harpoon - and he simply struck. And it happened. The whale was his, but it was precisely not his, for being his first whale he was bound to give it all entirely away. The whale had given Ernie a kind of accolade. The village thereafter began to recognize Ernie's worth and value his traditionalism more greatly4. But what of the wife of Ernie the whaling captain? She and Ernie's sister and sister- in-law had gone out at the full moon before whaling started, taking a bowl of water as Molly had described. The wife, Evie by name, raised the bowl to the moon and prayed for food for the children and that Ernie would catch a whale. "You have to pray aloud," she said when recounting the event later. "In Inupiat?" I asked. "You can use your own words", she said. "And look, we go and catch a whale!" A white man staying in the village termed this "magical thinking". Ernie knows that white people call it magic, and taxed me with it. I said "No, it's not magic, it's real". "Too many things have happened together," said Evie. "When the BBC man left town we began to catch whales5. Also you know when the whaling captain's wife has to walk slow? I was walking slow the very time Ernie caught the whale. Aaka6 was there, she said to me, "Evie, why are you walking so slow?" It was she herself who had told me 3 Ernest loved and revered his old culture. He was not a nationalist nor was he ready to put his people on a pedestal. He saw through some of the villagers' hungering for assimilation. He and a few others did much to maintain the old religion and its cultural heritage, which Christians were not supposed to call religion. 4 The product of any first achievement, whether the first taking of a whale or the first fashioning of bead earrings by a girl, should be given away. This custom might be taken as a kind of immediate communalization of some newly-developed ability and an acknowledgement of its social origin, as well as a way of initiating the person as a new producer for the community, and it is also a sign of the connectedness that runs through all Eskimo life. We may also seek in the society other instances of generously giving away valuables. This is Victor Turner's method of looking at the meaning of an act by seeing its position in the web of custom in that society - what he termed the positional level of meaning (Turner 1967: 51; 1968: 81). In this case the custom of generously giving food away appears to be connected with the generosity of the whale. The whale's leap and its spout are repeated in the flinging gestures of the women servers at the "Whale's Tail" feast and whaling festival, in the scattering of candy at the blanket toss, and the shooting upwards of the performer in the blanket toss. 5 Everyone understood the connection: the whales were now offering themselves to the village. We caught five in all, our full quota. 6 "Grandmother", Ernie's father's mother Dinah. 46/E. TURNER</page><page sequence="9">to walk slow or the whale wouldn't come. And at that very moment Ernie was catching the whale. Afterwards I asked him, "When you struck it, did it go away quickly?" "No, it went slowly". You see, slow. I was in the laundromat carrying the bags in, and I wanted to hurry, I was like half hurrying and half slow, and I made myself slow7". We heard that Ernie's men cut off the tail flippers of the whale and sent them to Evie, the wife. The wife is always given the flippers. Evie saw to it that the huge pieces were put in her ice cellar for the whaling festival. May The dismembering of the whale was performed with care. The first cuts were made by the village preacher. With face intent, he scored with his knife-tipped pole two straight lines a foot apart right down the whale's side, at the "belt". There was no conflict, no argument about shares. Indulging in conflict would repel all whales and close the ice. The butchering process was performed with the correct tools: the long-handled knife, the square-ended joint severer, hooks on long poles, and short knives. No axes or saws were used. Let us look at the scene. Each cut was first made with a little action of probing. There was not a single emotional act when they were cutting. As they carved into the white mass the fat sounded like crisp solid sugar, meanwhile six men hauled on a hook set in the flesh to assist the cutting. They were easing out a large three foot by one foot by one foot slab of skin and fat. They tugged until at last a separation occurred - with a thud and a splash on the puddled ice. Then laughing they turned the block on its hook and all of them marched off dragging it after them at a run, in step, toward their correct place in the array of shares. In 7 Evie's slow step was considered by the people to be the slow movement of the whale. Indeed the anthropologist Lowenstein, who spent much time at Point Hope, has argued that "the woman is the whale's body" (n.d.: 39). This would be more than communication, it would be identity. Such merging of symbolism into identity is a phenomenon that we may recognize as a distinct type of ritual understanding. Instead of Wagner's "symbols that stand for themselves" we have gone beyond symbolism altogether. Lowenstein's notion that the woman is the whale is shown in another rite once frequently performed at Point Hope and constantly referred to there - the "harpooning" of the whaling captain's wife. The wife is the first to reach the edge of the ice when the season begins. Then she lies down on the ice with her legs toward the water. The men who have followed her with the boat on a sled now launch it, paddle out a little, then come toward her. The captain makes a ritual stab at her with his harpoon, without hurting her. She rises and starts walking back toward the village. This causes a whale to rise in the sea and swim toward her; at once the waiting men intercept it with their boat and catch it Other accounts collected by Lowenstein suggest that both the woman in this walk of power (during which the whale's tail is sometimes seen emerging from her mouth) and the whale, who according to Lowenstein is mysteriously able to move underground into the entrance of her sod house, are shamans. Many masks of a woman's face are still carved with the whale's tail emerging from her mouth. Thus this equation would read "whale = woman = shaman". An ancient history among the Siberian Yup'ik identifies the whale with the woman's child, the result of a mating between a whale and a woman. According to the Siberian Yup'ik, ever since this event the whale-child has come from the sea as a guest of the humans in gratitude to the mother and its human kin. This version as far as I can tell is unknown to the people of Point Hope. The whale's tail in the woman's mouth might be read by psychologists as a type of childbirth. But it is more likely that at Point Hope where animal spirits are often mentioned, the phenomenon refers to spiritual transmogrification, again frequently reported in other contexts, such as woman into bear, man into seal. THE WHALE DECIDES/47</page><page sequence="10">the course of time they managed to cut off the tail entirely, then dug into the belly releasing a mighty waterfall of warm blood which soaked the ice for thirty feet around. It was the first river sound I had heard since the previous August. There was another strange sound, a gurgle from the stomach which elicited a cry of wonder from all. The guts were hanging out at one side. Clusters of tubes hung down that seemed to be in tassle form rather than connected. The ribs and sternum were already off and standing on one side like a great red boat. The lungs, kidneys, liver, and stomach still lay attached in a terrific homogeneous gray mass, slobbery and slack, ten feet across. The black muscle meat was cut off in ragged masses and dragged off to the meat division areas. The work went on with a forward momentum, with continuous energy, moved by the spirit of hunger, hunger for food of great value, theirs for the digging. A film crew would have spoilt the quiet happiness, the "us-ness" that reigned. Ernie showed me the ear with its six-inch tympanum on one side, soft and sensitive like an inverted baby's cheek, and on the other, a hard polished conch. He wanted me to see it because this is what had been listening to us. Ernie's manner was quiet, his face a combination of smile and dead pan. It was now midnight, but we could see. The immense bone-arch of the jaw still reared out of the skull. All was upside-down, the position in which the whale had died. The skull was now visible as an enormous red three-chambered edifice twelve feet across set on top with that great jawbone. All this had to wait. Standing in the gloom of twilight I heard Claudia and Irene say, "Evie must take out the heart. Iťs Evie. The woman". They helped her to do it, and eventually the heart, six feet across, lay separated on the ice. It was the women who cut up the organs, kidneys and intestines as well, and I worked alongside packing the curiously shaped slabs into sacks and loading them onto snowmobiles, whose lights now looked dazzling, even lighting up the people as they labored on the dim floor of bloody ice. At last in the newly growing light of morning we left and took our loads home. Next morning I came back to see the head, the only thing remaining on the ice. The spirit of the whale was alive inside it, and if the head were released the spirit would be able to grow its parka again and return. The men who had been working drew away. Ernie prepared them for the last task, the giving of the head to the sea, the work of niaquq. For the last time they tied ropes onto the jawbone, and Ernie stationed them along the ice margin beyond the head. They pulled, with a wrenching tug. They came this side, others steadying the head behind. They wrenched on the rope, rocked, attempting to rear the solid skull mass out of the pit in the ice that its own heat had melted. They wrenched and at last it was free of the hole, standing on ice nearer the edge. Now it was a matter of going back to the sea rim behind and pulling, then forward to the rim in front and pulling, edging the head crabwise toward that drop-off into deep ocean, the Chukchee Sea, upon which we all stood. It took half an hour. Steadily they pulled, exchanged sides, pulled, and the head crept toward the edge. At the edge itself they detached the ropes and all got behind the skull and pushed, straining, with all their might, their gloves drenched in blood. Heave! It moved. Heave! It moved. It teetered. Heave. There was an immense splash. Instantly drawing into a line they howled, "Ui-ui-ui! Yuuuuu!" and rocked with joy. The spirit, inua, was returned. All around there was a sigh of relief, for the ice was clear of the spirit, its red bulk released into the water where it lay, a submerged shadow. Everything was quite all right now. All that was left on the ice were the men and their shares - material things, ordinary. That great spiritual presence was gone. Without the 48/E. TURNER</page><page sequence="11">head the stretches of ice looked quite different, a vacant lot. And as the yells died down one more shout arose, "Come back!". Again, I noted, no conflict was the rule at the meat division. All in town knew the complex web of lines that was marked on the whale to assign parts. Further, only true whaling tools were used for the cutting, no tractors were used to pull the whale up onto the ice, no foreigners with cameras were allowed, the peaceful atmosphere was preserved. And we see how at midnight the wife's identity with the body of the whale - with in fact its very heart - was asserted. Then next day the head with its inner spirit was painstakingly returned to the sea, to grow its new parka, to reincarnate, "re-flesh" itself, and join the cosmic cycle (Fienup-Riordan 1983: 189-235) that rolls forward in continuous replenishment. The whale as a conscious being grows to be the dominant experience of all. An awareness of its consciousness, its spirit, flashed upon this participant at the moment of its departure. Commenting on a whale's vertebra carved by Tigluk Oviok into the shape of a human face, Ernie said, "The face is the whale's face. It is different . When the whale's parka is taken off you see the whale's face. All animals have that. When you take a whale you give back the face to the sea, and the whale grows a new parka. It can only do it twice. After that it becomes another animal". The word different is often used to mean what we might term "on another level". However their word different is probably the best one. Molly also termed the whale different . She said, "It talks to other whales, it knows if you are a good person". "Other whales will surround an injured whale and pull it away with them," said Leo Kinneeveauk. "Whales are ticklish", said Helen Stein. "They don't like to have pregnant women down on the ice". It was true, my research assistant was pregnant and left the village because from then on research would be impossible for her. When I was visiting Solomon Killigvug, his nephew Conrad was preparing for a trip. "Is he going hunting?" I asked. "I don't know", said Solomon. "The animal will hear if you talk like that. If you say, 'I am going to kill a whale', it will hear and something bad will happen. If you say, 'I am going down on the ice, and need some food to feed those poor people', the animal will come to be caught". It is possible to relate all these features of present-day culture to what has been recorded in earlier ethnography. For instance Eskimo accounts tell of a man actually turning into a whale (Pulu 1980: 52). Rainey (1947: 258) and later, Lowenstein ( Asitchaq ) give detailed Eskimo accounts of the itiviyai spirits who lived underground at the end of the point and possessed the power to change the wind and the weather. However it is not my purpose in this paper to compare these accounts point by point, but as I have said to show the culture in action. For every era is different, and takes from the previous one what is alive, requiring contemporary anthropological studies as well as historical and archeological ones. There have been multitudinous experiences of animals communicating with people in the history of Point Hope, far more than I could name, many of them influencing the present culture; but the power of this culture is in the last analysis in the Now. Therefore one needs to be alert for continual changes and unexpected subtleties in that "Now". Michael Jackson would call this "epistemic pluralism," which "suggests an opportunistic, improvisatory attitude to ethnographic enquiry. Truth is seen pragmatically, not as an essence but as an aspect of existence, not as some abstraction such as Science, Rationality, Beauty, or God, to be respected whatever the circumstances, but as a means of coping with life" (Jackson 1989: 185-186). "Can our discourse be THE WHALE DECIDES/49</page><page sequence="12">likened to... .a game we play with words, the thread of an argument whose connection with reality is always oblique and tenuous, which crosses to and fro, interlacing description with interpretation, instruction with entertainment, but always ambiguously placed between practical and antinomian ends? If so, truth.... is in the interstices as much as it is in the structure" (p. 187). What appears then is a contemporary operative play of events. I shall not call the elements to which I have called attention "a set of concepts", or even "symbols" with such and such "meanings". What I have shown is a moving process. The play of events itself produces "flashes" in the process of the hunting of animals - flashes that the people expect and understand yet which originate in the "random". Basically the arrival of a particular whale is a random event from the perspective of the world of cause and effect. The randomicity affecting the hunter therefore contributes to the effect of keying him into a different world from normal - different in time too since the random play of events in the hunter's life creates "hunting time" - which high school hours cannot subvert during whaling. (That year the school board allocated ten days subsistence leave for hunter youths, allowable whenever the whale appears.) Randomicity is expected, it is the norm for the hunters' world. The "magic" that Ernie was so defensive about is able to enter that world, substantiating principles like "the whale comes if you pray to the moon," or "the whale opens the water". This knowledge produces the hunter personality, whose center is "out there," in liminal space. The hunter's success spins on luck, like the divining spinning top used to predict the seasons, and he wants it like that, wants the gamble. The craze for Bingo is an apt substitute for this. The hunters are quiet men, not only because they have become accustomed not to disturb the game, but their random world has reached down into their very souls (I use the term "soul" advisedly. There is an invisibility of the soul itself, like the existence of a shard of glass in water). There is no cosy domesticity in these men and cannot be. They are forever hanging loose. The great whaling captain Amos Lane's last wish, so he told me before he died of cancer, was to go upriver to his caribou hunting grounds where the wild lands are. Through activity, then, the whale spirit comes into focus. Alongside, parallel with the activities, are the stories about them, their second life. The stories vitalize and sharpen perception, just as Evie's story of the laundromat, told after the event, sharpened it for her, and so did Molly's story of the stomach share for her. Perception is focused for everybody as the stories are told. My accounts, personally experienced for the most part, have to be the way they are because of the person I am, not able to imitate the Eskimo style, of course, but still my stories are a way in to perception. All humanity, Eskimos, Whites, Africans, whoever we are, live in a co-eval world as Johannes Fabian said (1983), that is, we do after all live in the same modern era. Let me end with a blatant metaphor about these events. The water opens and closes and skins over with young ice. The whale of illumination (for them and for me) sometimes swims through. It will happen naturally when all is mutually understood, if my soul is truly there invisible in the water - knowing that it is not possible for me as an individualist but only if I connect with the people (which is why, as an anthropologist, I was troubled about my moral state). 50/E.
