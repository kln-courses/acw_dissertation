Conner, Senior Minister, University Park United Methodist Church, Denver.) This book seeks to apply theological understandings of the death of Jesus to the task of preaching, all within the framework of process thought. It thus may be viewed as an attempt to combine theology, biblical scholarship, homiletics, and metaphysics?an unusual and perhaps ambitious agenda, but one that the authors, William Beardslee, John Cobb, David Lull, Russell Pregeant, Theodore Weeden, Sr., and Barry Woodbridge, are eminently qualified to address. The book is divided into two major sections. The first is comprised of three chapters and deals with the nature and purposes of preaching. The second is sub-divided into a section interpreting Jesus1 death as described in the gospel of Mark and a section interpreting the same subject in the writings of Paul. Two sermons, one by John Cobb and one by David Lull, are included as chapters. These are the only chapters whose writers are individually identified; the remainder of the material succeeds in a deliberate attempt at joint authorship. The first chapter affirms a positive relationship between preaching and faith, and then examines approaches to this relationship that may be derived from the thought of five German theologians?Karl Barth, Rudolph Buftmann, Gerhard Ebeling, Wolfhart Pannenberg, and Doroth?e Soelle. Preaching is said to function fundamentally as a way of "serving the Spirit," that is, as a way of conveying the liberating presence of God to people. Depending upon the situation and the congregation, this purpose is served by different homiletical aims: judgment, comfort, inspiration, assurance, challenge, drawing people into wider movements, leading them into psychic depths, sending them into the desert, incorporating them within intimate communities, prophesying against society, supporting traditional norms. "Good preachers are those who know their people well and discern what will truly enliven and inspire them here and now" (29). The second chapter takes the German thinkers already mentioned as its point of departure.</page><page sequence="2">68 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Whereas Bultmann, Ebeling, Pannenberg, and Soelle, in different ways, believe that the role of the theologian is to extract from this mass of biblical suggestions certain conclusions that can be presented as unqualifiedly normative and absolute, we disagree. The role of the theologian is, instead, to clarify the present situation in relation to scripture. This task cannot be done once and for all. The church in every generation needs to confront all the scriptural proposals again. To do so will be disastrous, however, if the proposals of scripture are understood as absolutes before which believers must sacrifice their minds. (42) Scripture is rather to be regarded as a source of Whiteheadian "proposition" or proposals which function as lures for feeling, thought, action, transformation, and liberation. In this connection Whitehead's comment is cited that it is more important that propositions be interesting than that they be true (35). The third chapter furthers this line of thought, alleging that good preachers "assist the Spirit in eliciting highly relevant proposals; inept ones elicit proposals that are received as too incongruent, or just boring" (71). The goal is to enable hearers to experience transformation from self absorption, fear, and redundancy, to self-transcendence, freedom, and creativity. The self-giving love of Jesus is a parable of and a lure toward this sort of transformatton (70). The section on Mark opens with an exegetical chapter in which Mark's own view of Jesus' death is investigated. The authors note that Mark's depiction of the resurrection is not simplistically triumphalistic or unambiguous, thus permitting the preacher to expand her/his hearers' understanding of God. The following chapter presents contemporary interpretations of Mark with a view especially to homiletical exposition. Jesus' suffering and death are related to the notion that God's power is persuasive rather than coercive, a theme that is in turn related to the problem of human suffering in general. The final chapter pertaining to the Gospel of Mark is John Cobb's, "Self Denial," a sermon on Mark 8:34. The section on Paul begins with a chapter about Paul's own interpretation of Jesus' death. In the ensuing chapter, which describes contemporary reactions to Pauline themes, the nature of justice is discussed. How can one understand that the injustice of Jesus' death is redeemed, or redemptive; and how does this bear on our own lives, not only individually but corporately? Again, the Whiteheadian distinction between coercive and persuasive power is mentioned, along with Whitehead's theory of internal relations. Our notions of justice and salvation must take into account the intrinsic interconnectedness of human life and, indeed, of all existence. The final chapter, "Deliverance From an Evil Age," is a sermon on Galatians 1:1 5 by David J. Lull.</page><page sequence="3">Voi 14, No. 1, January 1993 69 Within its self-described limits, the book is a cogent and interesting treatment of an important subject. Readers of this journal, however, may f ind that its discussions prompt several questions which the book itself addresses only briefly, if at all. One question has to do with the nature of God. For the most part it is assumed that God is a distinct ontological reality who may uncritically be spoken of as a personal Being who feels, deliberates, and acts in a rather anthropomorphic (though not masculine or hierarchical) manner (see 11,57 58, 62, 66, 104, 107, 126-27). This identifies the authors' perspective with right-wing or rationalistic/speculative process theology, in contrast to the left wing or empirical view which associates God with the kinds of value producing structures, modes of creativity and renewal, and wholeness which occur naturally, holding in abeyance the issue of an ontotogically distinct deity. One may wish that the book had acknowledged this distinction and addressed it. A second question, which is bound to be raised especially by readers who do not share the authors' theological assumptions, is whether to some degree process thought and liberation theology are being read back into Mark and Paul. This raises the larger question of the authority and applicability of the Bible (Why must biblical exegesis be an ingredient in every sermon? Or, why must every sermon be based on some specific text?) and another question which is larger still, of the general relation between faith and culture. The book may be viewed as an attempt to improve upon the longstanding divergence between conventional liberalism and kerygmatic-exegetical theology, via the development of a dialogic imaginative hermeneutic. The problem remains, however, that the final tests of dialogue and imagination are anchored in contemporary criteria such as reason and experience, at least in the process thought that the book espouses. There are points at which this seems to be acknowledged, but other points at which the authors seem to assume that the Bible is something of a Heilstatsachen, a text whose relevance and authority are accepted uncritically. These questions notwithstanding, this book meets the goals of relating biblical preaching to process theology and of offering many new and suggestive ideas to its readers.</page></plain_text>
