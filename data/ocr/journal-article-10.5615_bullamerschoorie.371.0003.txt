<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> A Stone Plank Figure   from Politiko-Troullia, Cyprus:   Potential Implications for Inferring   Bronze Age Communal Behavior Steven E. Falconer, Eilis M. Monahan, and Patricia L. Fall Plank figures are hallmark anthropomorphic depictions that illuminate Bronze Age society on  Cyprus. The excavation of a rare limestone plank figure from a public space at Politiko-Troullia  is interpreted in conjunction with spatial patterning of ceramic plank figures, plant macrofossils,  animal bones, ground stone, spindle whorls, and metallurgical evidence to infer communal be- havior at this Early/Middle Cypriot–period settlement. The Politiko-Troullia stone plank figure is  significant as the sole example from a fully documented excavated context and as part of a grow- ing body of evidence for the creation of social identities in emerging complex society on Cyprus.
