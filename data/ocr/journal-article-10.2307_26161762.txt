<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archives of Organizational and Environmental Literature THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF BIRD PROTECTION Mabel Osgood Wright and the Early Audubon Movement LINDA C. FORBES Franklin &amp; Marshall College JOHN M. JERMIER University of South Florida The purpose of this feature is to introduce activists and organizational and environmental scholars to a relatively unknown segment of the early American conservation movement. The authors focus on the period around 1900, a time in which birds were being slaughtered at an alarming rate, in part to supply milliners who used plumes and other bird parts to decorate women's hats. These practices led to a groundswell of opposition that eventually turned the tide in favor of bird protection and appreciation. They also formed a foundation for today's activism on behalf of beleaguered birds. One of the key figures leading this movement was Mabel Osgood Wright. Wright is only now beginning to receive the recognition she deserves, as is the case for many women of this era who made major contributions to the conservation movement. The authors highlight three major projects to which Wright devoted her energy (the early Audubon Society, children's nature writing and education, and the Birdcraft Sanc tuary) and discuss them as institutional manifestations of the early conservationists' bird loving philosophy. The authors also reprint three of her important publications. The authors believe that the reprints provide relevant insights for contemporary environmental protec tion and organizing. Few people realize what women have already done for conservation, and what they may do. —Pinchot( 1910/1967, p. 105) Mabel Osgood Wright (1859-1934) is one of the few women acknowledged for making significant contributions to the early American conservation movement. She remains relatively obscure, but the work of this naturalist, nature writer, educa tor, and activist on behalf of birds and their habitats endures today in a variety of institutionalized forms. In this feature, we focus on three of her enduring contribu tions. First, she has been credited with being a key figure in the successful reforma tion of what is currently the influential Audubon Society. Her Audubon work around the turn of the 20th century and thereafter included countless hours of orga nizing meetings and documenting accomplishments as well as writing editorial essays that were influential in motivating and directing the bird protectionist move ment. The style and substance of this work can be evinced by reading the selections we reprint here from the valuable, early Audubon publication Bird Lore. Second, her work as a nature writer and child educator was extremely significant and Organization &amp; Environment, Vol. 15 No. 4, December 2002 458-465 DOI: 10.1177/1086026602238172 © 2002 Sage Publications 458</page><page sequence="2">Forbes, Jermier / BIRD PROTECTION 459 included a number of important publications. With the resurgence of interest in early literary ecology, some of Wright's books and essays can now be found in anthologies of nature writing and ecocriticism texts (e.g., Anderson &amp; Edwards, 2002; Finch &amp; Elder, 2002; Mazel, 2001), in historical archives (see the American Memory Collection in the United States Library of Congress), and in reprinted form (e.g., Philippon, 1894/1999). Excerpts from one of her best works for chil dren, Citizen Bird (Wright &amp; Coues, 1897), are reprinted here. As can be seen, this book also has significant messages for adult readers. Third, beyond her organizing work with Audubon and her numerous books, essays, and editorials, Wright was also the driving force behind the formation of the innovative Birdcraft Sanctuary, named after the title of her 1895 field guide to birds. Wright espoused a philosophy of natural rights for all living things (Brooks, 1980) and demonstrated the importance of developing a personal relationship with the immediate, local natural environment (see Philippon, 1894/1999, on Wright's The Friendship of Nature), but her primary cause was the preservation and enhance ment of bird life. In this issue's Archives of Organizational and Environmental Lit erature, the three works we feature exemplify her multifaceted attempt to change attitudes toward nature and organize action on behalf of birds and their habitats. Like other conservationists, Wright was distressed by sentiments and practices at the turn of the century that were leading to the widespread devastation of many spe cies of birds. Birds were hunted for food and sport but were also being slaughtered at an alarming rate for milliners who used plumes and other bird parts to decorate women's hats. These practices, coupled with the popularity of egg collecting by boys, severely stressed bird populations. Wright worked to promote grassroots organizing to combat these practices. She used a variety of appeals to address the different audiences of her time. Although Wright was not alone in this effort as a woman or a conservationist, in retrospect, her work can be singled out for both its quality and its scope. That is, it is especially noteworthy because she effectively pursued so many avenues in initiating and helping to institutionalize social change. Wright was also considered unique in the environmental movement because her concept of conservation led her to emphasize the preservation and appreciation of the local environment (e.g., backyards, gardens, and bird sanctuaries) during a time when most were focused on developing national parks (see Fifth Class of Inductees into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame at www.senate.gov/~dodd/press/ Speeches/105_98/0512.htm). THE EARLY AUDUBON MOVEMENT The Audubon movement was formed in large part in response to the tremendous toll taken on bird populations by the millinery industry for the sake of women's fashion. Bird plumage and bird parts were used extensively in the making of hats following the Civil War as high fashion among upper class women reemerged in the United States (cf. Merchant, 1996). Feather fever spread widely in its appeal as women of modest means also began to include bird parts in their wardrobes. It has been estimated that by the turn of the 20th century more than 5 million birds were being sacrificed per year for fashion in the United States alone, and world consump tion exceeded 200 million per year (Doughty, 1975). A vast number of bird species were affected negatively by this fashion, but white herons and egrets were hunted unmercifully, especially during the breeding season when plumage was its most brilliant in color. The cruelty and barbarity of these practices in the service of orna</page><page sequence="3">460 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / December 2002 mental fashion produced a number of influential editorials and essays (e.g., Chap man, 1899) and a groundswell of opposition. The original Audubon Society emerged from this groundswell. But despite an enthusiastic start following its founding by George Bird Grinnell in 1886 (38,000 members joined within 3 months), it was discontinued due to an inability to orga nize this overwhelming response (www.audubon.org/nas/history.html). The move ment was revived again in 1896 as state organizations began forming, first in Mas sachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Iowa, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia (see Merchant, 1996, for an extensive review of the period). Wright was a founding member and the first presi dent of what is now the Connecticut Audubon Society, which began in 1898. She served in this role for 26 years and helped to foster its growth in membership and educational programs for the children of her state. By the time she began her orga nizing activities with the Connecticut Audubon Society, Wright had already estab lished a reputation as an important naturalist and author as she had published sev eral popular nature books and stories, many of which focused on educating children about birds and promoting bird protection. Her involvement and influence with the Audubon Society, however, extended far beyond her role in Connecticut. She is often credited with being a crucial figure in the successful revival of the organiza tion and, indeed, with being its most influential woman (Philippon, 1894/1999). As a state society president, Wright held national offices in what is now the National Audubon Society. When she resigned from the Audubon Society's board of direc tors in 1928, the remaining board members said of her, The unanimous feeling was that this Association, the subject of ornithology, and the cause of conservation of wild life all owe to you the deepest debt of gratitude for your services in the field of natural history during the past thirty years. (Philippon, 1894/1999, pp. 13-14) Another of Wright's important contributions was her undertaking of the role of editor for the Audubon Society Department of Bird Lore, the leading and influential popular journal of ornithology and nature study. Launched in 1899, Bird Lore was the precursor to the contemporary publication Audubon Magazine and, at the time, was the "main unifying force" of the National Audubon Society prior to the forma tion of the National Committee (Welker, 1955, p. 206). In this role, she regularly collected reports and updates on organizing activities and accomplishments of the state societies. She also wrote editorials that distinguished her, circulating her ideas on bird protection and on the appreciation of nature. Selections From Bird Lore In the first piece we reprint, "Back to First Principles," Wright ( 1902) provides a sensitive analysis of the raging conflict between the Audubonites (and other con servationists concerned about the welfare of birds) and the milliners, feather mer chants, hunters, and others who were driving and meeting the demand for bird parts. She asserts that the blame for the persecution of birds should be placed squarely on the public subscribing to the fashion and not on those with commercial interests who were responding to the demand. At the same time, she attempts to expose some of the tactics used by business and industrial groups to perpetuate their highly prof itable enterprises, including their attempts to discredit those in the antiplumage movement by labeling them as "extremists" and "sentimentalists." She quotes</page><page sequence="4">Forbes, Jermier / BIRD PROTECTION 461 directly from Millinery Trade Review, the key publication of the Millinery Mer chants' Protective Association, to show how they used clever language, humorous advertisements, ideological appeals, and sensible logical arguments to meet the challenges of the bird protectionists. She concludes this exceptional piece of ana lytical reasoning and environmental organizing strategy in the same way she begins it—by emphasizing the various types of appeals and maneuvers necessary to over come such a formidable opponent, including legislative initiatives. The latter approach was based on the practice of writing circulars and lobbying for model laws, which got the attention of industrial and political figures alike. In "Consistency" (the second reprinted piece), Wright (1899) speaks specifi cally to the antiplumage advocates in the Audubon movement about basic princi ples of organizing and strategies for saving the birds. In her view, bird protectionists could be divided into two groups. There are those who believe that a clean break from the feather-wearing habit must be made ("total abstainers") and those who believe, on practical grounds, that wearing the plumes of game or food birds could be permitted because the animals were killed for other purposes anyway ("moder ates"). She concedes that both groups could be useful to the cause but goes on to argue that it is too difficult to be a moderate. This is because it is important to be consistent in distinguishing contraband feathers and this can only be done through extensive, time-consuming study, an endeavor that cannot be practically under taken even by those who might be called aggressive Audubonites. Moreover, Wright suggests that feather traders might not be totally honest in how they repre sent the process of procuring and crafting the fashion such that even experts might be misled about the properties of the product (cf. Wright, 1903b). Her view of the long, devastating arm of the feather trade industry is made clear in the following statement from "Consistency": "But what bird can fly so high or find so eery a rest ing place as to escape the 'desire of the eye' of fashion?" (p. 172). Insights for Contemporary Environmental Protection and Organizing In these short editorial essays, readers should find numerous parallels with con temporary environmental organizing activities and some useful lessons. For exam ple, it should offer environmental activists some comfort to see that more than 100 years ago, antiplumage protesters were labeled as extremists by industrial groups and their supporters, despite the protesters' lack of militancy. And similar to the way Rachel Carson was vilified by her chemical industry opponents for supposed exaggerations and mistakes, claims that were never substantiated (see Briggs, 1997), Audubonites were often castigated as sentimentalists and were also labeled as clubwomen and faddish protectionists (see Welker, 1955). Obviously, these labels were intended to convey the message that the protesters lacked reasoning power and were overcome by emotion. Characterizations such as these were partic ularly negative during an era when scientific knowledge and ornithological research held sway. Wright was well aware of the need for careful research and accurate, well-informed statements and claims (see Wright, 1903a) and also real ized that the bias against women was especially acute when scientific knowledge was involved. As Brooks (1980) put it, "The world of science, with technical train ing it required, remained largely a man's world. Serious fieldwork, particularly in ornithology, still depended on the gun" (p. 89). The essays should also show how radical and reformist environmentalists of the past century struggled with compli cated philosophical and practical issues when it came to formulating and impie</page><page sequence="5">462 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / December 2002 meriting strategies for protecting nature. Even then, reformist positions tended to be taken for granted and radical thinking was treated with knee-jerk skepticism and countered with superficial dismissals. This can be seen most clearly in the second essay in the discussion of the statement "It is only a quill." EDUCATING THE CHILDREN The institutionalization of bird protection was also furthered through concerted efforts to educate the children of the nation. Child education was considered a cru cial first step for protecting birds from their human enemies, and it ultimately became the "legitimate work" for boards of education and agriculture (Forbush, 1907, p. 413). Wright played a very prominent role in institutionalizing environ mental educational for children. It has been said that she believed that the best way to preserve nature was through teaching children how to do it (see Fifth Class of Inductees Into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame at www.senate.gov/~dodd/ press/Speeches/105_98/0512.htm). Her commitment to children's education can be seen in a number of ways. For example, after turning her responsibilities for Bird Lore's Audubon Department over to colleague and coeditor William Dutcher, she served as editor of Bird Lore's Education Department for a number of years and also wrote regularly for the column. Another important forum for educating children that was created and celebrated during her time was Bird Day. It was often linked with Arbor Day in an effort to "inculcate conservation training and awareness in a broad spectrum of the public, especially school children" (see "Bird Day," Ameri can Memory Collection, United States Library of Congress). State Audubon societ ies offered grassroots help and supported the development of Bird Day and other educational programs. Wright led the Connecticut branch of the Audubon Soci ety's efforts through a variety of these activities, including distributing Bird Day programs to 1,350 Connecticut schools, preparing slides on birds for lectures, and producing and distributing bird charts and materials for needy schools and libraries (Philippon, 1894/1999). Wright also educated children through many of her books and stories. Nature writing, especially for children, was an acceptable form of public activity for women of the period. In particular, educating children in their civic and patriotic duties as well as helping them develop morally was considered the purview of women (Merchant, 1996) and was seen as crucial to building a great nation for future generations. Gifford Pinchot (1910/1967), noted conservationist, in his trea tise The Fight for Conservation, wrote in detail about this important responsibility: The growth of patriotism is first of all in the hands of the women of any nation. In the last analysis it is the mothers of a nation who direct that nation's destiny.... The great fundamental problem which confronts us all now is this: Shall we con tinue as a Nation, to exist in well-being? That is the conservation problem [italics added], (p. 102) I think it can not be disputed that the natural resources exist for and belong to the people; and I believe that the part of the work which falls to the women (and it is not a small part) is to see that the children, who will be the men and women of the future, have their share of these resources uncontrolled by monopoly and unspoiled by waste, (p. 105) Merchant (1996) explained the context for understanding why this role increas ingly fell to women. With the rise of the market economy, much of what had previ</page><page sequence="6">Forbes, Jermier / BIRD PROTECTION 463 ously been the domain of women regarding nature in subsistence agriculture shifted to men. The sphere of women was redefined such that it focused on indoor domestic labor and on their biological and social roles of reproduction. This accentuated the role of "moral mother" (p. 103) who must "actively engage herself in passing down a complex of moral virtues that would redeem the amorality of the marketplace and provide a refuge from the stress of competition" (p. 105). Middle class women (like Wright), Merchant noted, "found opportunities to influence consciousness about nature by educating themselves in the natural sciences, by writing children's books, and later by preserving nature through women's clubs" (pp. 105-106). Selection From Citizen Bird The third selection by Wright that we reprint here includes excerpts from the chapter titled "Citizen Bird," from the highly acclaimed book, Citizen Bird (Wright &amp; Coues, 1897). It exemplifies the linking of patriotism and a conservation ethic. Reproduced in its entirety in the "American Memory Collection on the Evolution of the Conservation Movement" in the United States Library of Congress, Citizen Bird stands out as a noteworthy literary accomplishment because it both entertains (through its fictionalized, anthropomorphic story form) and educates (based on sound scientific knowledge). Coauthored with noted ornithologist Elliott Coues and illustrated by the great bird artist Louis Agassiz Fuertes, Citizen Bird develops a compelling case for the value and rights of birds as participating citizens. A central message of Citizen Bird is that birds deserve protection, as do all other citizens. They qualify as citizens and deserve protection because they make valuable practi cal contributions to agriculture, plant maintenance, and insect control and because they produce positive effects on the human spirit through their beauty, song, and flight. BIRDCRAFT SANCTUARY Wright's third enduring contribution to bird protection and appreciation is the Birdcraft Museum and Sanctuary (www.ctaudubon.org/centers/birdcraft/ birdcraft.htm). Founded in 1914 in Fairfield, Connecticut, and named after Wright's (1895) classic book, the 10-acre development was the nation's first pri vately owned songbird sanctuary. Through persistent appeals to Annie Burr Jennings (a prominent and wealthy Fairfield resident), Wright generated the fund ing necessary to purchase the land for the sanctuary, which was then deeded to the Connecticut Audubon Society. It was carefully planned and designed by Wright to serve as an oasis in a desert of material things [so that]... the bird may lead its own life for that life's sake, and [so that] the joy of many such lives [will] overflow all arbitrary boundaries in its ethical benefit to the community and state. (Wright, 1915, p. 263) Like all of Wright's work, Birdcraft had a dual mission of conservation and educa tion with a special emphasis on building appreciation for the local landscape and bird life in Fairfield (Philippon, 1894/1999). At Birdcraft, Wright originated what has come to be referred to as birdscaping, the practice of planting indigenous spe cies of trees and shrubs to attract local birds and encourage their well-being. It has been estimated that Birdcraft, which began in 1914 with 52 nests, had 146 nests and more than 100 bird species by 1930, the point at which it had developed into a</page><page sequence="7">464 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / December 2002 fenced-in enclosure with 17,000 annual visitors (Wright, 1934). Birdcraft was rec ognized in the National Register of Historical Places in 1982 and registered as a National Historic Landmark in 1993 (Philippon, 1894/1999). In most respects, Birdcraft may be considered an innovative and successful monument to Wright's conservation ethic and bird-loving philosophy. There are some practical issues, however, that interfered with the realization of her ecotopian vision. Ironically, due to Birdcraft's success in attracting human visitors, many of the songbirds were driven away in the early years, limiting the educational value of the preserve. This led the governing board to restrict admission for a period of time (since rescinded) and expand the offerings in the museum's mounted bird collec tion (Philippon, 1894/1999). Also, in 1957, nearly half of the sanctuary's land was set aside by the state government to make way for the Connecticut Turnpike. For this sacrifice, the Connecticut Audubon Society received only $45,000 in compen sation from the state, which corresponded with the appraised real estate value of land and not with its value as a sanctuary or even as a community asset (cf. Philippon, 1894/1999). One other issue that surfaced had to do with the way the Birdcraft environment was managed in the early years. Although birdscaping and other practices marked the sanctuary with distinction in the eyes of many at the time, Birdcraft managers also engineered the removal of "problem species" by exterminating many of the enemies of songbirds. During the first 3 years of the sanctuary's existence, to protect the songbirds and create the conditions in which they could thrive, large numbers of European starlings, English sparrows, and cats (as well as smaller numbers of other predators) were killed. This practice paralleled the common view of the day that there were good and bad species (Brooks, 1980) and that it was proper for humans to adjudicate struggles for survival and intervene on behalf of the favored species. Birdcraft's invasive management practices reflected nativism, the belief system held by Wright and most of her contemporar ies that assigned priority to indigenous species. This belief system contradicted Wright's espoused philosophy of natural rights for all living things, which illus trates once again how she experienced many of the same conflicts and problems with which today's environmentalists are grappling. A WOMAN OF HER TIME AND THE BUILDING OF PROGRESSIVE INSTITUTIONS Mabel Osgood Wright was a woman of her time, but she can also be seen as one who strove to break free of the narrowly prescribed roles accorded women in the public sphere. Much (but not all) of her writing fits within the prescribed gender roles of her day, and she shared many of the Victorian sentiments and prejudices of the middle and upper classes. Readers today would be repulsed by the ethnic slurs and racist comments that pepper her essays, and her disregard for some species of birds (e.g., English sparrow) and some animals that prey on birds (e.g., cats) might also seem surprising. But readers are as likely to be impressed positively by her acu men for fostering civic activism and an abiding appreciation of the majesty of nature that can be found in local environments. There is also, however, evidence that she was keenly aware of and resisted the limitations placed on women. For example, in 1913, following an illness, she expressed to Audubon leader T. Gilbert Pearson her preference for professional over domestic labor. She wrote, I'm picking up again but feel that I must concentrate my work in [the] future to what really counts, and let society and inane visiting go, together with many things</page><page sequence="8">Forbes, Jermier / BIRD PROTECTION 465 which the Devil of modern life has invented to kill both time and the people who follow him. (Philippon, 1894/1999, p. 13) Her eventual appointment to the American Ornithologists' Union, the male-domi nated organization devoted to the scientific study of birds, provides further evi dence of her ability to transcend traditional gender roles. Increasingly, albeit with some significant limitations, Wright is being viewed as an early ecofeminist and as a noteworthy contributor to the American conservation movement.
