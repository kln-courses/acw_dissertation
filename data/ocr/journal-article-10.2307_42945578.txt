<plain_text><page sequence="1">Irene R. Fairley The Reader's Need For Conventions: When is a Mushroom Not a Mushroom?* i Stylistics has proved to be an important tool for the description and classification of texts and has provided literary studies with perceptive analyses of the function of language in literature. Now with the advent of a reader- oriented criticism, stylistics can be propitiously applied to the study of trans- actions between reader and text.1 A mulititude of new questions clamor for attention. For instance, do textual language patterns direct reader attention? What cues are picked up by readers and why? Literary education assumes that student readers can improve, but as researchers we need to determine more precisely the nature of the skills we wish to promote. Anyone who is engaged in the teaching of literature is aware of the great diversity of response possible for any given text, no matter how "simple" the text may be- or seem to be. There is also a range of response that we may expect, and, indeed, strive for in classroom discussion when we teach literature. The phenomenon of diversity and similarity is intriguing, complex. We tend to think of the response range as in some way "controlled" by the text, and stylistics has- sometimes rather rigidly- tended to emphasize this aspect. Di- versity seems more closely linked to the reader and such factors as individual personality, age, sex, education and cultural background, context for reading, and so forth. Nevertheless, we expect to find areas of consensus for any given text and to be able to identify adequate or preferred readings. As Armstrong (364) contends, there are "standards and restrictions" that permit us to test for the validity of a reading and to set limits for plural meanings. Inadequate readings may arise from a faulty interaction of reader and text, in that readers may overlook textual language patterns or be unaware of reading goals. Experienced readers develop a script for reading. They know what to expect when confronting a literary text and how to proceed. They read selectively and actively, asking questions, anticipating structures, and drawing inferences. An experienced reader has "a rich internal set of expectations about successful comprehension" (Kintgen 25). Language influences reading and in- * Earlier versions of this work were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Modern Language Association, December, 1983, and at the Rhode Island College English Colloquium Series, October, 1984 STYLE : Volume 20, No. 1, Spring 1986 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Irene R. Fairley terpretation only when readers are already sensitive to the types of structures that "operate" in literary texts, that is, know what to look for. Agreement about these structures, strategies for discovering them, and interpretive goals are conventions for reading in that they are culturally determined and need to be learned. Much of the recent discussion of interpretive conventions has been fo- cused on experienced readers or on ideal readers who may be little more than a semiotic function- "the repository of the codes which account for the intel- ligibility of the text" (Culler 38). Such research provides valuable understand- ing of the conventions of our culture. Yet there has been a bias, perhaps even abhorrence, which has stifled serious consideration of inexperienced readers. Such a bias is unfortunate. For if we wish to understand fully the process of reading and interpreting, studying novice readers can help us to observe how textual strategies are being acquired and applied- or not being acquired and applied. The difficulties that relatively inexperienced readers have with texts may clarify for us the kinds of interpretive moves that require more formal training. Culler assures us that the whole institution of literary education depends upon the assumption that . . . one can learn to become a more competent reader and that therefore there is something (a series of techniques and procedures) to be learned. We do not judge students simply on what they know about a given work; we presume to evaluate their skill and progress as readers, and that presumption ought to indicate our confidence in the existence of public and general- izare operations of reading. (125) II. Undergraduate Reader Responses In the following pages I will review a study of undergraduate responses to a poem in order to discuss their reading strategies.2 The study provides some interesting divergences of interpretation and evidence of how they were arrived at. One hundred and nine students enrolled in sections of a Freshman English course that included an introduction to literature responded to a ques- tionnaire. They were given two pages, one containing the poem, and another the questions. The poem, "Mushrooms" by Sylvia Plath, was reproduced as below with stanza numbers included for reference purposes.3 Mushrooms Overnight, very 1 Whitely, discreetly, Very quietly Our toes, our noses 2 Take hold on the loam, Acquire the air.</page><page sequence="3">The Reader's Need for Conventions 3 Nobody sees us, 3 Stops us, betrays us; The small grains make room.

We are shelves, we are 9 Tables, we are meek, We are edible, Nudgers and shovers 10 In spite of ourselves. Our kind multiplies: We shall by morning 1 1 Inherit the earth. Our foot's in the door. Readers were asked to respond to four questions: (1) Underline the words or phrases that you believe most clearly express the meaning of the poem. (2) Which stanza was most difficult for you to understand, and why? If you need additional space please continue your reply on the back of this page. (3) Were there any individual words which gave you difficulty? If yes, which ones? Try to explain why they are difficult. (4) On the reverse of this page, or the page containing the poem, please provide your interpretation of the poem, and support it with quotations from the poem. In reviewing results, I will focus on the responses to question (4) and will discuss responses to other questions as they shed light on the process of in- terpretation. Results are also presented in Tables 1-3 and Figure 1. Once the more idiosyncratic readings, such as the poem is about "born again Christians" (#26) or "people who ride the T [public transport system]" (#46), which were given without support or explanation are set aside, inter- pretations divide into major groups and subgroupings. A large set of forty- eight readers, whom I will call Group I, reads this as a nature poem, a poem about how mushrooms grow. They read referentially, making such comments as "The poem is telling about mushrooms and how they grow at night. Over- night. How they multiply and what are their uses" (#4). Some readers are more specific:</page><page sequence="4">4 Irene R. Fairley This is basically the life span of the mushroom. From the time it cracks the soil "Acquire the air" to the final eating stage- "we are tables" . . . They hit the shelves in cans "we are shelves" then eventually the table "we are tables." (#50) . . . this poem is celebrating the continuance of nature. That silently vegetative life and therefore all life is perpetuating. Man can not destroy this serenity because the poem states "nobody sees us, stops us, betrays us." This implies the helplessness of man against nature. (#71) Another representative response moves sequentially through the poem: I believe that its what the title says it is. The poem deals with mushrooms and how they grow. "Overnight very whitely" symbolizes the mushroom that thrives in cool dark places, mushrooms grow best at night. They most often grow wild in the woods: "Nobody sees us, stops us or betrays us." They grow at a fast rate and all they need is water and shade and this is brought out in the line "We Diet on water, on crumbs of a [sic] shadow" and mushrooms grow in bunches often pushing each other aside and should they start growing unwatched they will continue to grow in great numbers. (#44) A second set, whom I will call Group II, reads mushrooms as losers: the meek, oppressed people who take over the world, the silent majority seeking upward mobility, or children and the threat of overpopulation. Or they may read mushrooms as some evil force slowly conquering. A number of readers in this group connect the mushroom image to atomic destruction. In general, the two groups provide literal readings (I) and figurative readings (II). Both the individual reader responses and the responses of the readers as groups enable us to trace some sources of plural meanings in the reading conventions that are followed. Of particular interest is the motivation of Group II readers to go beyond a referential reading. The move to read "Mushrooms" as other than descriptive poetry appears to stem from an awareness of an attempt to apply particular reading conventions. The strategies are plural and do not appear to function hierarchically, but rather as a shifting or flexible constellation of options. Some may be dependent on or suggested by others. Among the interpretive conventions that I will refer to in discussing responses will be intertextuality, reading for human significance, reading for coherence or unity, accounting for endings, for metaphor, for deictics, resolving language contradictions, or anomalies. Group I Readers Group I readers while interpreting literally will frequently express dis- satisfaction with their reading or with specific elements in the poem that remain outside their account. Only one reader who found lines he could not relate seemed content to let them remain unrelated- but even he as an afterthought to his interpretation suggests that the poem is really a "mushroom trip" and that this "often happens when people trip": that is, their thoughts may seem unrelated (#33). Although his comment may be meant simply to be amusing,</page><page sequence="5">The Reader's Need for Conventions 5 his move to seek another level of explanation suggests that he has internalized the convention of reading for unity. Expecting to be able to account for all elements, he moves to a model that permits inferences about the speaker's state of mind. What at first seems to be a merely flippant remark provides evidence of how presupposing reading for unity as a goal of interpretation leads the reader to another level of mimesis and a reading beyond descriptive poetry. Most readers in Group I follow the conventions for descriptive poetry in which "the conversion of first-order mimesis to second-order mimesis need not take place" (Culler 96). They read the title as a "sign of the author's intention" (Riffaterre 72) and may simply question items that they can not readily fit into their literal interpretation. For example, one reader insists: "Mushrooms" is all about how the mushrooms break through the surface. While they supposedly do this "quietly" and "discreetly" they also "heave" and "ram" upwards towards the surface. The mushrooms are, in fact, "earless, eyeless and perfectly voiceless" yet burst forth with life. They ask "little or nothing" of the earth, but to be able to live. They are everywhere and no matter how small a part of the earth they are, "their fooťs in the door." (#19) Nevertheless he goes on to question stanza 10. Another reader, #6, remarks but does not worry about the fact that words in stanza 10, like "nudgers and shovers," lead to unrelated thoughts. Most often literal readers found stanzas 4 and 5 troublesome. Their re- marks identify the problems they have with these stanzas: finding the referent for "soft fists," relating semantic contents to the description of mushrooms, accounting for contradictions of tone. A great many cite stanza 5 as the most difficult: "I can't associate those words with a mushroom" (#9); "What was meant by that?" (#1 1); "there are different meanings for these words [paving, hammers, rams], and I don't know which way your usage wants them to mean" (#41). One reader trying to cope with stanza 4 says, "In most other stanzas I can understand and find even far-fetched relations to mushrooms. Yet in this stanza there seems to be no connection. . . . There is one remote connection . . . 'the leafy bedding' which refers to the leaves and grass which are around it as it grows" (#56). Another reader complains about "Soft fists": "Why do they put this in? When I think of fists I always think of hard, dirty, atmosphere" (#94). Even readers who do not articulate problems with stanzas 4 and 5 may indicate inability to deal with them. For instance, some persons neglect dis- cussing them altogether. Respondent #60, providing a paraphrased meaning beside each stanza, neglects to comment at all on 4 and 5: st. 1 mushrooms are bright white in color, also very quiet st. 2 they grow from the ground and up into the air st. 3 they are unnoticed by anybody</page><page sequence="6">6 Irene R. Fairley st. 4 st. 5 st. 6 they grow almost anywhere without much of a problem st. 7 they survive on water and need nothing special st. 8 there are so many mushrooms and yet they require very little for survival st. 9 mushťooms come in various shapes and sizes and all are edible st. 10 other forms of plant life are trying to grow and the mushrooms keep on multiplying st. 11 in a very short time they will appear all over the earth, and in our homes The responses to question (2) regarding the most difficult stanza showed overwhelming selection of stanzas four and five (refer to Table 1). Thus the frequency data for question (2) supports observations about reading difficulties based on the interpretive responses [question (4)]. Similarly, Figure 1, which presents question (1) underlining results as frequencies above words, corro- borates readers' avoidance of words and stanzas that are difficult or puzzling. These are less frequently selected as expressing the meaning of the poem.4 Still other readers have problems accounting for the last stanza. A reader puzzles: The mushrooms seem to be talking about themselves. They call themselves meek and Bland- mannered then they turn around and say that they are going to inherit the world: become dominant- like that is their only goal in life. The tone of voice seems to change abruptly from soft to loud and overpowering. (#63) Thus, many readers perceive language contradictions in the poem and express a desire to resolve them. But literal readers do not necessarily have the script that would help them to achieve such resolutions. Some readers struggle with Plath's use of personification: "Why toes, noses?" (#14); "Why the personification?" (#70). One reader complains: "The poem is told from a mushroom's point of view and we see that it is trying to say that they are harmless. They do not bother anyone, they grow overnight and they are gone by morning. ... I could not tell who's soft fists they were or what needles they were heaving. It was confusing" (#22). The presence of language signaling human features puzzles literal readers. Referring to stanza 5, a reader queries: "What does that have to do with a mushroom; except that you know its not a person" and also cites stanza 10: "nudgers and shovers . . . what are they?" (#43). Many readers deal with the personification by treating it as incidental to the description of mushrooms: they look like toes and noses, and they are earless, eyeless, and voiceless. Group I readers select a subset of lexical items from the poem and base their interpretation on it. They tend to ignore vocabulary items they do not know or understand, as well as lines which they cannot integrate into their reading. Many fail to get beyond an initial, referential reading of the poem, although such a move is cleüarly necessary for an inclusive reading of "Mush- rooms." Some of these readers, however, become disturbed by items that they</page><page sequence="7">The Reader's Need for Conventions 7 can not fit into their interpretation. Their expression of frustration and un- happiness is significant as it reveals an expectation of unity. These readers are at least familiar with the convention that interpretation should account for all aspects of the poem. They expect to be able "to bring under some general heading the particulars that the poem lists and describes" (Culler 69), but they may not have learned the strategies that would enable them to provide a coherent and consistent reading. Group II Readers Readers who move to a second level, often directly after acknowledging a literal one, make use of a variety of strategies and provide a range of inter- pretations in which mushrooms are a threatening force. They give indications of assuming that "a poem says one thing and means another" (RifFaterre 1). For instance, mushrooms may be a vegetable form of life that takes over, or "aliens" (#53), "martians or outer space invaders" (#46), in a "science fiction type theme" (#7). Such readers appear to follow a convention that allows for the reversibility of figures; they read the propositions of the poem as literally true in a metaphorical world. They bring a number of descriptive codes into play as they search for generalized meanings. Their comments link "quietly" and "discreetly" with the idea of multiplication and with the phrases "inherit the earth" and "our foot's in the door." They refer to the aliens as "they" but the victims sometimes become "we": "we will be overrun" (#29); "they are . . . moving into our realm without the consciousness or awareness of any person or thing" (#53). Readers do this despite the use of the first-person pronoun for the threatening force within the poem. Their tendency to become the recipient of the threat suggests another very general reading strategy: look- ing for themes of human significance, of universal interest or applicability. They expect Mushrooms to be more than mushrooms. In a particularly interesting instance, one reader first provides a literal interpretation but then experiences difficulty with both stanzas 4 and 5, "be- cause they [mushrooms] are being described as meek, quiet, discreet which seems to be the mood of the poem when in these 2 stanzas words like fists and heaving seem to interrupt the poem" (#55). This reader goes on to interpret Plath's poem as "describing a situation that may never come true yet still gives the reader much to think about. The fact that mushrooms might inherit the earth could only be possible if the human race was entirely wiped out. In this respect it [the poem] gives the reader a sense of awareness that he had better take heed to the silent things which may be a hazard to his very existence." By using a strategy of accounting for contradictions of language and mood, this reader came up with a more inclusive, figurative reading. A large set of the figurative readings identifies the threatening force as human, so that humans (as mushrooms) are pitted against humans. Most often</page><page sequence="8">8 Irene R. Fairley these readings cite lines from the last stanza, a strategy we may refer to as attention to endings, or closure. One reader concludes that: "The repressed people of the world will rebel. This interpretation is reinforced by the last stanza" (#18). Another decides that: "Up until then we were looking at the growth of mushrooms imaginatively through the eyes of the mushrooms. Yet in the last stanza they take on a human quality that had up until then not been seen. That was reasoning ability . . . intellectual actions ... the power to think and reason about world domination" (#75). Readers provide evidence of the convention of reading for intertex- tuality- that is, reading the poem with reference "to other texts and to the clichés and descriptive systems of a culture that result from the repetition of connections and associations in texts" (Culler 105). Several readers cite the clichés: "The author uses the paradox of mushrooms, although quiet and hum- ble, slowly growing and 'inheriting the earth,' possibly to indicate his feelings about the type of person that gets ahead in life, or the means by which most people accomplish anything ('our foot's in the door')" (#31 is quoted, but responses 3 and 95 were quite similar). The importance of the last stanza for readers is confirmed by the results for question (1). As Table 2 and Figure 1 show, the entire last stanza accounts for the twelve highest frequencies assigned by readers in the underlining task. (Closure prominence is also recorded in Fairley, "Experimental Approaches" and "On Reading Poems.") Readings of the last stanza reflect both expectations of closure and at- tention to the convention of intertextuality. From a stylistic point of view, this overlapping of conventions corresponds to overdetermination (Riffaterre 21-22). A peculiar juxtaposition of references in the final stanza permits readers to bring into play cultural codes not usually associated with mushrooms or a vegetable form of life. It may even be the case that reading for intertextuality leads some individuals to the possibility of figurai reading. After a quite literal account, "It conveys the silent but quick rise of mushrooms after the summer thunderstorm," one reader suddenly concludes with "they seem to be Christian mushrooms: 'We are meek ... we shall by morning Inherit the earth' " (#27). Another responder explains, " 'the meek shall inherit earth' is the theme here," and adds, "It is interesting to note that mushrooms grow underground; where the meek would be during a nuclear war" (#2). Although the line in stanza 9 is "we are meek," readers overwhelmingly make connections between stanzas 9 and 1 1 and paraphrase the text as " the meek shall inherit." There is ample indication of reading for intertextuality. It is not clear, though, whether inter- textuality prompts the move to relate parts of the poem, or whether the reverse sequence of strategies may occur. There is evidence that another strategy, reading for oppositions, comes into play here as well. Some readers point to an inherent contradiction in the language, which can be perceived as present in the Christian intertext. One reader, #17, explains that the quiet language of the poem gives way to a bold-</page><page sequence="9">The Reader's Need for Conventions 9 ness that increases at stanza 10. Readers may even identify the dichotomy they perceive in terms of specific lexical items: "It is about mushrooms but I think it is also about mankind (mushrooms = mankind). Basically, I think it says both how insignificant and yet how powerful we are. Words like 'acquire' (stanza 2), 'insist' (stanza 4), 'paving,' 'hammers' (stanza 5), 'Inherit' (stanza 11), show our strength" (#57). We can see, then, that many Group II readers follow the interpretive strategy of taking the poem as metaphorically true in a literal world. The landscape of the poem becomes reflective of some larger human concern that occupies the poet. These readers find human references in two intertexts, one the Christian allusion and the other the salesman's cliché. Overwhelmingly, readers identify a personification of the mushrooms as human "have nots." Is such a move a response to the poem's closure or to the first introduction of human features in lexical items? Or is it prompted by particular words or phrases that may be contradictory? Perhaps such aspects of protocol are in- dividually determined. Only occasionally do readers make explicit comments: "As the poem goes on about stanza 6 it starts to talk about people" (#49). Responses in this study suggested that some readers may begin with a preferred orientation, either literal or figurative. Those who tend to read lit- erally have difficulty with words that are marked for human features or in- tentionality. They tend to question words like "toes," "fists," "noses," "ham- mers," "rams," "shoulder," concentrating on what can be referentially explained and visualized. On the other hand, those who read figurally question the words "tables" and "shelves": "I've heard of mushroom clouds, phallic mushrooms, magic mushrooms, but not shelves and tables" (#27). Such readers may show a tendency away from visualization, moving more directly to a figurai level. Group II readers seem to be on the alert for human significance and sensitive to the presence of personification. They may note the "physical hu- manization of mushrooms" (#75) and cite, for example, "toes," or "noses," or make interpretive comments like: "Humans push and shove in crowded streets trying to move, grow like mushrooms growing in multitudes" (#95). Several readers identify human features as they move sequentially through the poem: The poem isn't really talking about mushrooms but rather uses some of the qualities that a mushroom possesses and applies them to human qualities. Nobody pays attention to something or somebody who is very small and "meek" so it is possible for that small group to "very quietly . . . take hold of the loam." And because of their small size nobody sees them or stops them or betrays them because they are of no immediate threat. The same is true with an inferior group of people. They can build up without anybody noticing, "widen the crannies shoulder through holes." The holes or gaps left by an unsuspecting society. Stanza 10 tells that this group is inferior or at least believes themselves at the moment to be inferior with the line "nudgers and shovers in spite of ourselves." The ending is almost like a warning and it has a hopeful tone to it also. "We shall by morning inherit the earth. Our fooťs in the door" tells the reader that this group has a lot of confidence in themselves.</page><page sequence="10">10 Irene R. Fairley Many times through history all that was needed in order to attain victory was confidence and perserverance. (#59) A second reader who interpreted similarly includes: The mushrooms being described as discreet, and quiet, could be people. The poem goes on to elaborate how they take hold of the loam and acquire air. This could represent beginning of life by getting a firm grasp and good footfold. The line nobody sees us supports the idea of discreet and quiet, as if it were people. Why don't others see them? Perhaps it is an underpriviledged group, the handicapped fits in. Voiceless, earless, and eyeless support this idea. Widen the crannies and shoulder through holes shows a difficult path as a hand- icapped person would have. . . . (#48) In their responses both of these readers, like #27 cited above, identify stanza 9 as difficult. The first reader simply questions: "How are they shelves and tables?" (#59). The second works toward a resolution: "Stanza 9 is difficult to explain but by being tables, shelves and meek and edible shows how they are looked upon as something of little meaning," and comments additionally, "One has to realize the shape of a mushroom to picture it as a table or shelf" (#48). It is interesting to note that Stanza 9 ranks third, following 5 and 4, as the most difficult stanza selected by readers (see Table 1). While literal readers find stanzas 4 and 5 troublesome, figurai readers are puzzled by stanza 9. Group II of the undergraduates demonstrates the acquisition of conven- tions necessary for figurai reading. These readers seem to understand that "a rhetorical figure is a situation in which language means something other than what it says . . ." (Culler 41). In arriving at their interpretations they make use of several strategies- moving from a literal to a figurative level, paying atten- tion to oppositions, and reading for intertextuality, for closure, for human significance. They seek a unified, inclusive reading in which they can account for elements that may not at first have appeared to be related. They have learned to look beyond what is given in the text, if necessary, to construct a system of interrelationships. General Observations Considering the entire set of undergraduate readers, we may draw from their refreshingly candid responses some general observations. For one, they are far from being "innocent" readers. They have expectations about texts and specifically about poetic texts. Students follow strategies that they have learned, presumably from previous reading experience and instruction in literature. They certainly show signs of having been initiated into the community of readers in our culture, but they display an uneven acquisition of its conven- tions. For instance, in this study nearly half of the students did not go beyond a literal reading.5 The study also documented some problems students have with poetic language. Results for question (3) show that 30 students selected the word</page><page sequence="11">The Reader's Need for Conventions 1 1 "loam" as difficult, pointing perhaps to a largely urban group of readers or to the word's increasing rarity. Other words identified as difficult are in order of their frequency rank: rams, hammers, nudgers, shovers, whitely, crannies, bland- mannered, paving, shelves, tables (see Table 3). Most students are troubled, "not so much that there are difficult words but trying to relate their meaning and understanding to the poem" (#51). Uncommon words like "loam," deviant forms like "whitely," and metaphorical extensions like "hammers" and "rams," trip up students who have not fully developed a script for reading poems. III. More Experienced Readers How would the approaches of more experienced readers, such as graduate students or literary critics, differ from the undergraduate responses? An extensive reading by a graduate student is available for the Plath poem. Sharon Silkey and Alan Purves (1973) have published a study in which Purves presents and reproduces, with very little commentary, his student's notes. Silkey's reading reflects an English graduate student's familiarity with reading conventions. It provides an instructive comparison with the under- graduate readings, even though the studies are not matched with respect to response time (roughly two hours versus one) and context (home versus class- room). It is, nevertheless, useful to consider similarities and differences in the approaches. Silkey makes use of the same strategies that are evident in the under- graduate responses. She includes both literal and figurative readings, looks for human significance, and pays attention to dichotomy, to personification, to closure, and to intertextuality. Her response runs to six pages; thus, rather than quote at length I will focus on points of comparison. Silkey's very first response signals her figurai inclination. She focuses on items with human associations, and reconstructs a biblical allusion in much the same way that the undergraduates do, by making connections between stanzas 9 and 11. tozes, nozes baby fists "crannies," grannies "diet on water." "crumbs" hermit Next to last stanza crowds The meek? shall inherit the earth. The Bible by God (ostensibly) salesmen "fooťs in the door" meek? (64)</page><page sequence="12">12 Irene R. Fairley She immediately attends to the search for human significance, which remains a guiding principle much in evidence in her responses. In her sixth reading (a lengthy response) she looks for specific analogies: "Are the small grains weak, nice people who don't make it in the survival of the fittest game?" And further on, "An unthinking mass multiplies and by morning we inherit the earth. Yich" (66). In her last reading, the fifteenth, she states, "These mushrooms could be fallout, or sinister Hollow Men. Frightening to think that Hollow Men multiply and inherit the earth" (71). Like some of the Group II readers, Silkey shows a strong predilection for reading figurally, rather than literally. Not until her tenth reading does she comment on visual images, recalling how "the mushrooms in my sister's back- yard pop up overnight," but visual associations lead her to a figurai reading: "THE BIG BOMB" (67). Not until her twelfth response does she acknowledge a literal reading, and then she does so only briefly: "Like the roots of trees that crack cement as they grow, these mushrooms widen the crannies. This poem could be a charming little verse that is really about mushrooms. But the last stanza frightens me. The implied 'meek' from 'inherit the earth' doesn't merge very well with that 'foot's in the door' " (70). A similar sequence of thoughts opens her last response: "This poem fits together very well if you read it merely on a literal level. Still the poem disturbs me, especially the last stanza. I think some of the things I've drawn from the poem are a bit far- fetched, yet I am still unwilling to read it on a literal level" (70-71). Thus, she is not really convinced that the poem "fits together very well" when read literally. Elements in the poem, particularly in the last stanza, frustrate her efforts to read for unity and cause her to shift back and forth from literal and figurai perspectives. Again, like some of the Group II readers, she is not able to do much with the words "tables" and "shelves." All she offers is, "in fair- ytales, fairies use mushrooms as tables and chairs" (70). Throughout her readings Silkey employs the convention of intertextual- ity; her use of this device shows more sophistication and awareness than the undergraduates of cultural codes and possible intertexts. Her second reading introduces another biblical allusion: "Go forth &amp; multiply" (65). In her third reading she associates "rams" with the golden calf. Then the word "betray" leads her to think of Christ. She mentions the Bomb and Hiroshima. Beginning with her eighth response she makes references to poetic tradition, bringing into her comments Hopkins, Coleridge, Sartre, Joyce, and T. S. Eliot. Silkey demonstrates well another strategy that is much less evident in the undergraduate readings: the convention of reading ungrammaticalities or oddities as signs (Riffaterre 2). Undergraduates tend to ignore or at best ques- tion such items. Silkey concentrates on them and reads them for significance: " 'Acquire the air' is a funny phrase. It's like taking a possession instead of the usual things you do with air like inhale or breathe or sniff' (65). Among phrases she contends with, she tries several times to account for "bland-man-</page><page sequence="13">The Reader's Need for Conventions 1 3 nered." Finally, she looks up "bland" in Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language (an option not available to the undergraduates). Her deliberations include: " 'bland-mannered' smooth-mannered, soothing man- ners, indifferent manners, straighten out the syntax; it might help" (68); "bland- mannered- asking little or nothing. These darling little mushrooms are polite, perfectly innocuous, of course" (70). She worries more about deictics, time references (which do not, however, lead her to any interpretive insights). She also worries about pronouns. For instance, she tries to clarify groupings: " We are one group. The small group is the only other group. 2 groups Small grains make room; therefore we are not stopped. They pretend they don't see &amp; are afraid to betray. To whom could they betray us if there are only 2 groups?" (66). Later, she again questions, "Who is the 'we?' the mushrooms, the mushroom shaped clouds, the messed- up people? You, when you first read the poem, should have assumed that 'we' was the mushrooms. That would have been a more literal reading, but you seem to have a tremendous inability to grasp the obvious" (69). Silkey takes a problem-solving approach from the very beginning, as- suming that meaning will not be obvious, and that the actual language of the poem is indeed only the iceberg tip. Her readings show familiarity with the kinds of operations that are called for to fill out what the poem conceals. She has learned a set of questions to ask and a set of strategies to help her find answers. From her very first responses she seems aware of what an adequate reading would achieve. Of course, she also brings into play a greater store of historical, literary, and cultural knowledge. She does not hesitate to express her feelings or to evaluate her own responses. What seems of particular interest is the way Silkey's fifteen separate re- sponses to the poem incorporate the range of meanings created by the under- graduates. Her deliberations seem almost a tribute to plural meanings. While undergraduates tend to offer one or perhaps two readings, Silkey seems to understand that there is a range of interpretations possible within the con- ventions. She also shows the more experienced reader's ability to synthesize and evaluate; her overriding concern is to construct the most plausible reading. Sometimes she comments on her interpretation, rejects her own remarks as trivial or digressive, or reminds herself to return her attention to the text. IV. How to Increase Competence? Is such literary awareness to be the province of specialists, or do we wish to make competence more general? Most educators would, I believe, endorse the objective of making literary competence accessible, but our methods of initiating readers are not always very effective. How to better educate under-</page><page sequence="14">14 Irene R. Fairley graduates, like many of the Group I readers discussed above, is a pressing issue. Can less experienced readers be helped to increase their competence by reading literary criticism? Although it is a common practice in university classes, it may not be a practical approach to improving scripts for reading. For one thing, critics often "explain away discrepancies that are meant to confound the reader" (Culler 67); they tend to minimize textual problems as reading problems. Their concern is usually with evaluating a poet's work, or with arguing for a particular reading, rather than overtly demonstrating interpretive goals and reading strategies. This difference of objectives can be seen in critical references to "Mushrooms." Reviews of The Colossus sometimes include remarks about the poem. William Dickey, comparing Plath and Hollander, explains his preference for Plath's work "because her subjects are more accessible," and goes on to remark that, "Miss Plath is narrower in tone than Hollander; she often deals with landscape and the figures in it, and her voice, while gracefully varied, is per- sistently serious. Sometimes she makes excursions into mythology, sometimes she considers, with forceful imagination, the consciousness of crabs, mush- rooms, snake-charmers" (762). Another reviewer, Guy Owen, evaluates Plath as "a rare talent and a consummate craftsman." Owen continues, "She cannot, like most young poets, be labeled 'promising,' for she has already written a handful of perfect poems ('Aftermath,' 'Mushrooms,' and 'Spinster,' among others) and developed a voice all her own" (209). In a longer review, A. E. Dyson focuses on the poem as illustrative of a particular quality in Plath's work: In Mushrooms, the quality of menace is even more chillingly detected in the sinister, almost cancerous proliferation of fungus. This macabrely ironic vision of a form of life infinitely lower than man simply waiting in endless patience to 'Inherit the earth' has the vividness of science fiction at its best, without being in the least sensational. (The associations which the word "mushroom" have for us since Hiroshima may enhance the effectiveness, which is not, however, dependent upon them.) (182) For later critical references the poem becomes a reflection of Plath's psychological state and is evaluated in relation to the rest of her work, as well as the work of other poets. For example, Edward Butscher explains: Only in "Mushrooms," an odd and attractive little poem written later at Yaddo, would she reduce the extraneous matters to a core truth, shove her consciousness directly into the eye of nature itself. Though strongly influenced by Emily Dickinson, "Mushrooms" is closest in spirit to Theodore Roethke in that it assumes a vegetable identity in the murky realm of preconscious infancy. In form, a lean and whimsical form Emily would have appreciated, the poem never misses a beat, sounds simulating sense in a felicitous merger of eye and ear: "Our toes, our noses/ Take hold on the loam,/ Acquire the air." Anthropomorphic mushrooms have freed Sylvia's lines of clutter, suggesting the success of "resolve," perhaps because the concept had a simplicity of design that required no convoluted parentheses of layered reflections and cross references. . . . The play upon the prediction of Jesus that the</page><page sequence="15">The Reader's Need for Conventions 15 meek would inherit the earth is ironic without being brilliantly so, yoking Sylvia's real distance from the rest of ordinary humanity with her prevalent consciousness of a threat- ening nature and man. (244-45) More recently, Jon Rosenblatt (1979) takes up the poem in a chapter about Plath's Beginnings . He introduces it as "a fine example of Plath's treat- ment of the theme of death in The Colossus " (57), and as "representative of the poems that deal with animals and nature" (58). Before moving to a critical evaluation of the poem as too limited- because "Plath caricatures human real- ity by projecting only aggressiveness onto the natural object" (60)- Rosenblatt provides two pages of analysis with considerable attention to sound and dic- tion. One paragraph, in particular, deals with language in the poem: The difference between "Mushrooms" and the earlier apprentice work lies in the specific attention Plath has paid, first, to the visual details of the fantasized animallike mushrooms and, second, to the aural qualities of her language. Visually, the poem gives us a race of mobile mushrooms: animal or human forms are projected onto these small natural shapes. The mushroom's roots become toes; their stems, noses; their caps, fists. These creatures quietly and "whitely" push through the forest floor like an army of soldiers. Here Plath's visual imagination anticipates the later brilliant images of Ariel : "bedding" and "paving" are "heaved" up; the "shelves" and "tables" of the caps cover the once-pastoral forest area. With an ironic nod to Tennyson's "flower in the crannied wall," Plath finds sinister "cran- nies" through which the mushrooms "shoulder" their way into the light. As in the later poem "Elm," Plath makes nature speak in its own voice out of a consciousness that is animate through and through. (59) While these critical treatments of the poem, especially the last, may en- hance our understanding of "Mushrooms" and help us to see it in relation to the larger body of Plath's work, they could hardly suffice as texts from which to learn strategies for literary interpretation. Indeed, they are not intended as such. Essays focused on critical commentary are directed to experienced read- ers who are familiar with the styles and goals of critical discourse. However, public interpretations may serve to provide textual models from which a semi- otics of reading can be derived. V. Future Directions Traditionally instruction has focused on historical, biographical, or new- critical approaches, for example, and interpretations of texts have been handed down. But not all readers can successfully intuit from demonstrations the principles they need to become better readers. While inexperienced readers have much to gain from studying individual literary works, they also need to be taught more directly the presuppositions of interpretation. Literary edu- cation assumes that student readers can improve; as researchers we need to determine more precisely the nature of the skills we wish to promote. If we</page><page sequence="16">16 Irene R. Fairley can make more explicit the principles involved in interpretation- and more precise the description of reading strategies- then we might improve our meth- ods of teaching. The new reader-centered classroom approach that is devel- oping is certainly a move in the right direction. I do not believe it is sufficient unless accompanied by presentation and discussion of goals, principles, and strategies. Principles need to be set forth, such as: look for human significance, expect parts of a text to be cohesive according to some overall composite plan, expect to arrive at a meaning that is more than simply the literal meaning of each textual part, and expect the final section to provide an appropriate conclusion. (These principles are, of course, culturally determined and subject to change. For instance, deconstructionists would make different assumptions.) So, too, can we set up other, genre-specific strategies which account for different ways to read poems, stories, plays, comedy, tragedy, romance, science fiction, and so forth. Finally, it is not enough to tell students to read for human significance, or to read for unity, or to organize the narrative into mysteries and solutions.6 Students need, as well, to learn the appropriate strategies that will enable them to recognize cues that point to possible human significance, models that will help them to organize specific details under a generalization, or the specific questions and answers they are likely to need for various genres. Such for- mulations must be explicitly set forth. Indeed, they would make worthy proj- ects for researchers in stylistics and semiotics.

Cooper presents more empirical and pedagogical approaches. 2 Support for this study, conducted in Spring of 1 980, by a grant from Northeastern University's Research and Scholarship Development Fund is gratefully acknowledged. I want to thank teaching assistants in the Department of English for their cooperation and the undergraduates who provided responses. The students, from five sections of Freshman English II, represent diverse major fields. Their unedited responses are iden- tified by number when quoted. 3 "Mushrooms" was first published in Harper's July 1960), 25, and later included in The Colossus (37-38). According to Ted Hughes, Plath composed the poem in the Autumn of 1959 during a stay at Yaddo where they took long walks and "devised exercises of meditation and invocation" (191). 4 It seems generally to be the case that in underlining, readers avoid words and stanzas that they have independently selected as difficult. The pattern is also observed in an earlier study (Fairley, "Experimental Approaches") where a similar questionnaire was used with students responding to a poem by e. e. cummings. In the present study as well as in two earlier response studies, readers show a purposeful selection in underlining. Although the number of words selected varies in</page><page sequence="17">The Reader's Need for Conventions 17 each of the poems read, the number of words underlined per person does not increase in proportion to the length of the text. Readers in two groups responded to the cummings poem of 62 words with mean underlinings of 18.3 and 16.3 (Fairley, "Experimental Approaches" 339). For a poem by William Carlos Williams having 56 words, readers had a mean of 19.5 underlinings (Fairley, "On Reading Poems" 89). In this study the Plath poem has 1 1 3 words, twice the number of the previous poems, yet the underlining mean score is 24.5. Perhaps this pattern reflects a general reading strategy, an expectation of finding a limited core of salient words. 5 Petrosky presents a more grim picture. He cites conclusions of the 1981 third National Assessment of Educational Progress for reading and literature that, "American schools have been reasonably successful in teaching students to recall textual infor- mation and make inferences in the multiple choice format, but have failed to teach more than 5% or 10% of all students to move beyond initial readings of texts." Petrosky is concerned that "students have not learned the response skills that would allow them to make written interpretations and look for evidence to support their interpretations by referring to the reading selections or their own ideas and values" (75-76). 6 Kintgen takes the position that "In their present form Culler's conventions are not much help to somebody who does not already know how to use them: they lack the explicitness that is a prime requisite of linguistic theories" (179). He argues that the various conventions Culler presents are, rather, "constituents of successful inter- pretations, of the answer the reader seeks" (181). Works Cited Armstrong, Paul B.
