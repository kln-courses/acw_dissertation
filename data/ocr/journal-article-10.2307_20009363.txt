PURPOSIVE ACTION BERNARD BEROFSKY THERE are two radically different theories as to the nature of purposive action, i.e., as to the analysis of "P does A in order that (for pur pose) #." The causal thesis, as I shall call it, main tains that the analysis will take the form of a state ment asserting a causal relation between psycho logical states of P and his doing of A. Hence, the explanation of the action provided by the refer ence to P's purpose is of the same type as the explanation of a machine's behavior, i.e., causation by internal states. A person holding the causal thesis may, of course, believe that man's internal states are distinctive, e.g., that only man has desires and beliefs. The other theory, which I shall call primitivism, maintains that the explanatory relation between an act and a purpose is not reducible to a causal rela tion but is rather distinctive. Thus, man is dis tinctive both in his possession of desires and beliefs and in the way these desires and beliefs account for his actions. Ducasse has defended the causal thesis. His analysis of "P does A for purpose x" is roughly "P does A and his doing of A is caused by a desire for x and a belief that A will achieve x."1 Chisholm has argued for primitivism.2 Insisting that explanation of purposive behavior is sui generis, he introduces as a primitive notion the idea of doing something in the endeavor to do something else and defines a number of concepts in its terms : doing something for a certain purpose, the notion of a successful intentional action, etc. This set of concepts cannot be reduced in the way Ducasse advocates, i.e., to causal relations between states and behavior. An important advantage of the Ducasse view is that his analysis uses a familiar concept, viz., causation. Thus, the puzzling notion of purposive action is explained in terms of a concept we under stand or, at least, have to try to understand any way. But Chisholm refuses to allow that the family of concepts he is interested in can be clarified further. In this way, he establishes the uniqueness of psychological explanation where purposive behavior is concerned, one is on a radically inde pendent plain of concepts. In this paper I shall defend the causal thesis by showing that prima facie counterexamples to a version of it can be incorporated into modified versions of the causal thesis. In the course of the discussion, I shall also reply to a serious charge of circularity. The only other arguments against the causal thesis with which I am familiar are designed to show that the claim that a causal relation be tween desires (beliefs) and actions exists is in compatible with the fact that certain logical or con ceptual relations hold between desires (beliefs) and actions. I have tried to show elsewhere that these arguments all fail,3 and if that is right, this paper should suffice to establish the causal thesis. At least, the burden of proof falls upon primitivism. Since the causal thesis is a claim about the form any adequate analysis of purposive action must take, I shall produce an actual analysis and see whether or not it is an extensionally adequate one. The analysis I shall defend differs in one significant way from Ducasse's version. Chisholm points out that a man may set out or endeavor to do what he does not want to do. So a man can do something for a certain purpose even if no desire is motivating him. But Ducasse's analysis requires that a pur posive act be caused by a desire. I think Chisholm is right. Normally, when a man does something in order to effect some end, we sup pose he wants that end. Even if it turns out that he is doing something he really does not want to do, we can find some reason, e.g., he feels obliged to do it, or he is doing it to prevent some greater evil, e.g., going to the dentist. But there is no logical absurdity in supposing that a man does something in order for some end to come about without having any reason. Suppose I reach out to pick up a 3" 1 C. J.

Does it have to be the case that I wanted to do that? Maybe I did, but maybe not. Surely there might be no conscious desire. There might have been an unconscious desire; but this requires substantiation; therefore, the attempt to substantiate it might fail. Some act descriptions, of course, logically imply the existence and explanatory efficacy of a reason, e.g., "He is satisfying his sexual desire." But even if we suppose that this act cannot be redescribed without any implications regarding its explanation, as some theorists believe, I am simply saying that some purposive actions require no reason. What I think has happened is this : When a man does something for some purpose, the explanation we seek is in terms of the man's desires or reasons. And we suppose that if we dig deeply enough, some reason will appear. Now this suspicion may be cor rect. But we ought to distinguish the nature of pur posive action from the normal explanation of pur posive action. I shall, therefore, drop the concept of desire from my version. Let me present an analysis that has some initial plausibility even if it turns out to be ultimately unsuccessful, and then explain some key terms in it : in order that \ for purpose 1 x = ^ with the intention that j i P does A at t 2. P believes at t that A has some chance of bringing x about 3. (2) is a necessary condition in esse of (1) 1. "Bring about" can mean "lead to" or "satisfy." In other words, the definition is sup posed to cover cases in which a man does some thing so that it will lead in the future to some consequence, e.g., I invest in the stock market to get rich, and cases in which the purpose is the act itself under a different description, e.g., I give you this money in order to pay back a debt. 2. (2) is often expressed more strongly, e.g., P believes that A will probably bring x about. But it is clear that a man might act purposively where he has only a slim chance of success. A man might undergo an operation to save his life even if he has say a 5 per cent chance of success if his chances of survival are zero without the operation. 3. Analyses, like Ducasse's, very often use the term "cause," but do not submit it to any more careful scrutiny. Instead of "cause," I am using the more specific concept of a necessary condition in esse. c is a necessary condition in esse of e if and only if c is a necessary condition of e and c exists at every moment e exists. Thus, at any moment during 's existence, e would cease if c were to cease. Being born is a necessary condition of a person's being five years old, but not in esse. Oxygen is a necessary condition in esse of fire because fire would cease whenever oxygen is removed. Oxygen, in other words, sustains fire, while being born does not sustain being five years old. c is a necessary condition of e in a situation S if and only if S is an instance of a general (non logical) law that entails the occurrence of c given e and a set of conditions / in S. Since action-types can be performed for an indefinitely large number of purposes, the belief-token described in (2) is necessary to the action-token described in (1). Hence, the applicable general law takes the form "(1) and/implies (2)" (where "f" is instantiated in the situation) rather than "(1) implies (2)." We may also stipulate that where the analysis fails for some belief bx, but succeeds for a disjunc tion of beliefs of the form of (2) that includes b1 (where each belief in the disjunction is non vacuous in the sense that its omission from the dis junction makes the disjunction fail the analysis), then the action is multipurposed. Thus, if I invite friends to dinner in order to satisfy an obligation and in order to have a pleasant evening, it may be that neither purpose is necessary to the act of inviting them in that situation, but the disjunction of purposes is. It is to be noticed that the concept of a necessary condition in esse is applicable to inanimate physical nature as well as human nature. Thus, the only conception in the definition that has unique applicability to persons is the concept of belief. We have dropped the concept of desire, and we have preserved the idea that no special relation between action and its explanation exists in the human sphere. Thus, if purposive action is man's distinctive trait, on my view, that turns out to mean that man is the only creature with beliefs and that these beliefs can be efficacious in the dull and uni versal sense of causal efficacy, or, more specifically, the efficacy of necessary conditions in esse. The reason that the belief is a condition in esse will become clear when we consider the objections to the extensional adequacy of the analysis. Objection 1 : (R. Taylor4) A man in an audience 4 R. Taylor, Action and Purpose (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1966), p. 249,</page><page sequence="3">PURPOSIVE ACTION 313 wants to attract the speaker. This state makes him fidgety and he thereby attracts the speaker. But he did not fidget in order to attract the speaker. More over, he may believe (correctly) that his fidgeting would attract the speaker. My analysis deals successfully with this case. It is true that the man did not fidget in order to attract the speaker because, although he believed that fidgeting would attract the speaker, this belief was not a condition of the fidgeting. If his desire to attract the speaker made him fidgety, the belief that he would attract the speaker was irrelevant and, if anything, might have inhibited the be havior. But if it is true that he would have ceased fidgeting upon coming to believe that the speaker is not being attracted by it, then he really is fidget ing in order to attract the speaker. But, it may be objected, there are cases in which a man who wants very much not to attract the attention of the speaker fidgets ("involuntarily") because he believes that fidgeting would attract the attention of the speaker. The belief, in other words, makes him nervous and causes the fidgeting; but he is surely not fidgeting in order to attract the speaker. It seems clear that this man did not fidget in order to attract the speaker because he did not fidget intentionally. A similar case would be that of a pianist who believes that he will play badly if he looks at the music and looks at the music (unintentionally) just because he has this belief.5 Since a man does not do A in order that x unless he does A intentionally, we ought to modify (i) in the analysis to read "P does A intentionally at ." We now face the dual task of analyzing the appropriate sense of intentionality and replying to the following charge of circularity.6 Even if some causal analysis is extensionally adequate, it will not succeed in reducing purposiveness to a causal rela tion between states and behavior because the states, viz., beliefs or beliefs and desires, must be con strued as causes of actions and the concept of action here is intrinsically purposive or intentional. There are, it seems to me, at least two concepts of action, one purposive, the other non-purposive. I may wish to distinguish the fact that I raised my arm, where this act may have been performed un intentionally, unthinkingly, out of force of habit, etc., from the fact that my arm just rose. That is, we may wish to distinguish doing from undergoing in a sense whose elucidation requires no appeal to the concept of purpose. I have nothing illuminating to say about this sense of "action." But since it is a legitimate sense and since it involves no covert reference to purpose, I may use it. Call this "actionj." We may now use the causal analysis to define the purposive sense of action. "I raise my arm inten tionally (on purpose)" means "I raise my arm (actionj sense) and this action has as a necessary condition in esse the belief that I raise my arm." In other words, to do P intentionally is, roughly, to do P "because" you believe you are doing P. But there is a difference between doing P inten tionally and having P as one's intention. It is not my intention to wear down the carpet when I walk to the other side of the room to get a book. But I knew that I was wearing down the carpet and I could have walked around it. I can be held responsible by a neurotically fussy housekeeper. Hence, there is a sense in which I wore the carpet down intentionally although wearing the carpet down was not my intention. Since I would have worn the carpet down even if I had come to believe that I was not wearing it down (I am mis informed about the carpet's properties), this case fails my analysis. Hence my analysis analyzes the stronger claim that such-and-such is the man's intention. In other words, "Jones raises his arm and this action has as a necessary condition in esse Jones's belief that he raises his arm" analyzes "In raising his arm, it is Jones's intention to raise his arm." That is all well and good because the stronger claim is the one implicit in purposive action. If my belief that I was wearing down the carpet was causally irrelevant to the act, I could not have been wearing down the carpet in order, say, to anger the housekeeper.7 Hence, the concept of action implicit in purposive contexts can be analyzed in terms of a causal relation between two beliefs, a belief about what one is doing and a belief about the outcome of what one is doing, and the action itself, the latter being understood in a non-purposive sense. The weak sense of intention whereby I wore the carpet down intentionally may be understood simply in terms of the presence of the belief (knowl edge) that I was wearing down the carpet plus, perhaps, the fact that I could have acted otherwise. 5 I am grateful to R. Shope for this example. 6 The charge was leveled by A. Collins in conversation. 7 If the modification mentioned under objection 2 is adopted, this statement will have to be amended accordingly.</page><page sequence="4">314 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY It is well known that the latter requires clarifica tion; but we may need it here if doing something intentionally (even in the weak sense) implies responsibility. This analysis of intentionality enables us to say that the man who fidgeted involuntarily did not act intentionally because the belief that he is fidgeting was not a condition of the fidgeting. But it is not clear that all such cases are so easily handled. May it not be the case that the pianist would not look at the music he is playing unless he believes he is looking at the music he is playing? Or can a neurotic husband claim that he does not inten tionally insult his wife although he would not do it unless he took himself to be insulting his wife ? These two cases differ in important respects. The neurotic husband's claim is plausible because, as we suggested earlier, intentionality suggests the power to act otherwise and the neurotic husband presumably lacks that. Even so, he may be insulting his wife in order to get her goat, and we said earlier that a man does not do A in order that x unless he does A intentionally, in which case it follows that the husband's insults are intentional. This result is not really counterintuitive were it not for the sug gestion of the freedom to act otherwise. (A psycho analyst would certainly say and the husband might come to agree that his insulting is intentional.) Since purposiveness is our primary concern, and since his behavior is clearly purposive, we shall say that his insults are intentional (for this result is not, as we have seen, fundamentally counterintuitive). The other case includes an interesting feature that seems to account for our regarding the act of looking at the music as nonintentional. The act takes place only because the person wants it not to (although he is not acting out of a general resolu tion to do what he does not desire to do). Although I have argued that a man may do A intentionally even though he does not want to do A, he does not do A intentionally if he does A out of the very fear of doing A unless another condition of A is his general resolve to do what he fears (or the specific resolve to do what he fears in this case). Thus, there are connections of a sort between desire and intentionality and we shall note others later. I only object to the claim that intentionality or purpose implies desire. Once these modifications are incorporated into our analysis of intentionality, it appears that this notion can be analyzed without recourse to any of Chisholm's primitive ideas. Objection 2 : (R. Chisholm8) A young man wants the money he would inherit if his uncle were to die and believes he would get the money if he were to kill his uncle. This desire and belief agitate him so severely that he gets into his car, drives recklessly, and accidentally kills a man he later learns is his uncle. So the desire for money plus the belief that killing his uncle would satisfy the desire causes the young man to kill his uncle. But obviously he did not kill his uncle in order to get the money. This interesting case causes us no difficulty because the man did not kill his uncle intentionally. Moreover, condition (2) requires that there be some belief at the time the act is performed of the form "this act has some chance of getting me my uncle's money." If the act is described as "running over a man," the nephew does not believe that this act will make him rich because he does not know that the man is his uncle. If the act is described as "running over his uncle," then at the time of the action, the man does not believe that the act of running over his uncle will make him rich because he does not believe that he is running over his uncle. He has the general belief that if he ever kills his uncle he will be rich. But my analysis requires that he have a specific belief about the act he is performing and a man cannot believe that his specific action A will lead to B if he does not believe he is doing A. I am not maintaining the patently false position that a man who is doing A must believe he is doing A. I may sit down on a wet seat without realizing it is wet. But I cannot sit down on a wet seat in order to have a good excuse for changing my slacks if I do not believe I am sitting down on a wet seat. But what about a man who turns on his radio in order to hear music, oblivious of the fact that the radio contains tubes that must warm up if the radio is to work. We may say that he is heating up tubes without realizing it when he turns on the radio. May we also say that he is heating up tubes in order to hear music? If so, a man may do A in order that x without believing he is doing A. If we accept this counterexample, we can revise the analysis by converting (2) into a disjunction of the original (2) and: There is an A' such that P does A', A' is causally relevant (necessary or suffi cient) to A or in fact identical with A, and P believes at the time he does A' that A' has some chance of bringing x about. We shall then have to revise (3) by adding the disjunct: P's belief at the time he does A' that A' has some chance of bringing x about is a necessary condition in esse of ( 1 ). 8 Op. cit., pp. 29-30.</page><page sequence="5">PURPOSIVE ACTION 315 This revision allows us to say that a man heats up tubes in order to hear music, but does not require us to say that the nephew killed his uncle in order to inherit the money. If A is "running over a man," the nephew neither believes that running over a man has some chance of getting him his uncle's money nor does he believe at the time that he is doing something related in the specified way to A that may result in the desired consequence (although he is). If A is "running over his uncle," since he does not believe he is doing this, he does not believe that running over his uncle has some chance of getting him the money. Nor is there an appropriately related act that he believes will have this result (although there is). Shall we accept this revision ? Since I am really concerned about the causal thesis rather than my particular version of it, this question does not interest me. I have established that the revision would be in line with the causal thesis. Hence, the causal thesis is preserved regardless of whether or not we wish to suppose that the man warmed up the tubes in order to listen to music. There will be analogous occasions in this paper where I shall try to demonstrate that prima facie counterexamples to my original version of the causal thesis can be con sidered genuine ones to that version, but not to the causal thesis as such. Let us now introduce the term "emasculation" for any demonstration of the impotence of an objection vis-a-vis the causal thesis as such. (If we accept this revision, we shall have to allow that a man can do A in order to x where he does not do A intentionally, although there always will be an action A' related in the specified way to A that he does intentionally.) Even if we waive the above considerations and allow that some appropriate belief was a condition of the man's act, the case fails (3) because the man's belief that killing his uncle would make him rich was not a condition in esse. Cases like Chisholm's where beliefs and desires set a chain of events going are advanced by others against Ducasse-type analyses. But these criticisms fail to recognize the way beliefs and desires function in purposive behavior. Beliefs and desires do not only initiate action; they sustain action and it is in their sustain ing role that they are purposive. If I have a sudden urge to do something and do it an hour later I will not be doing it in order to satisfy the urge if I no longer have the desire at the time the action takes place. Or if my belief that Gold Eagle will win the race causes me to go to a certain window at the track where I meet a friend who convinces me that Gold Eagle will lose and that it is good to bet on a loser because the track needs the money, then my belief that Gold Eagle will win the race led to my betting on him. But I am not betting on Gold Eagle in order to win some money since I no longer have this belief at the time of action. I have tried to incorporate this sustaining role of beliefs in the analysis by requiring that the belief be necessary at the time of the act, i.e., the act would cease when ever the belief ceases. Suppose I believe Gold Eagle will win and am about to plunk down $2.00. All of a sudden I recall that Gold Eagle is a mudder and it is a sunny day. There are several possibilities : ( 1 ) I may take back my $2.00. So the belief that Gold Eagle will win turned out to be a condition in esse of the (hypo thetical) act of betting $2.00 for the act ceased when the belief ceased. And we would say "I was about to bet on Gold Eagle in order to win money." (2) I may, for a number of reasons, leave the $2.00. I am embarrassed or it is too troublesome to go to a different window, etc. If asked "Why did you beg $2.00 on Gold Eagle?" it would be clearly wront for me to say "Because I thought he would win." The belief that he would win was only a condition in esse during the early stages of the action. The act had a momentum of its own; so that I did not really bet on Gold Eagle because I thought he would win. The truth is that I bet on Gold Eagle because I was on that line and I became embar rassed or I was lazy, etc. Moreover I was on that line initially in order to bet on Gold Eagle in order to win some money. Thus, so long as the belief that Gold Eagle will win sustains my act, I am doing whatever I am doing in order to win money. Should the belief change, the explanation of my action would have to change. Or suppose a man jumps from the Brooklyn Bridge in order to commit suicide. He may, as he falls, come to believe that he will not be killed; but he does not, therefore, return to the bridge. Here, too, we can say that he jumped in order to commit suicide. But the explana tion of his fall is provided by physics if we want to know why unsupported bodies fall or by the fact that he jumped if we want to know what initiated this particular fall. In either case, he is not falling in order to commit suicide. (Some act-descriptions apply after we cease to have direct control over them, e.g., he is hitting the target with his arrow.9 In these cases, a man's 9 I am indebted to R. Shope for this example.</page><page sequence="6">3l6 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY beliefs are pertinent only up to a certain point. Evidently some appropriate restriction can deal with these, e.g., our thesis does not apply to those actions or parts of actions that a man can perform after he has died.) Objection 3: There are many acts I would not perform if I discovered that they would have un desirable consequences. For example, I would not open the refrigerator if I thought it would blow up. On the proposed analysis, therefore, I open the refrigerator so that it does not blow up, rather than so that I can get an apple. This criticism fails to notice that I must believe that my act will have a certain consequence if the consequence is its purpose. The failure of the refrigerator to blow up is not a consequence of opening it. The refrigerator did not blow up when I opened it; but this does not mean that I caused it not to blow up. There are many states the world is in at the time the refrigerator is opened, negative and positive, that I did not cause. Of course, my purpose might have been to prevent the refrigerator from blowing up, in which case, as the analysis says, I would not have opened it had I not believed there is a chance I would thereby prevent it from blowing up Objection 4: (R. Abelson10) A man may skydive in order to act courageously, i.e., in order to do something life-threatening. So when the man jumps, he believes there is a chance he will get killed and he would not jump if he did not have this belief. For if he thought there was no chance he would be killed, the act would lose its interest he would not be displaying great courage. On my analysis, therefore, we would be forced to say that he skydives in order to be killed and this is clearly not so. This objection can be answered by adding a plausible condition. Because of cases like the man who undergoes an operation that has only a 5 per cent chance of success, we were forced to weaken condition #2 so that a man must only believe that the act have some chance of success. But clearly if a man is doing A in order to x, he will not be averse to doing A if he learns that x will definitely result from his doing A. Hence a fourth condition is plausible : If P were to believe that A insures x, he would still do x. The skydiving case fails this con dition. If the skydiver learns that his death is in sured by jumping, he will not jump. Or if he does, then he really is jumping in order to commit sui cide. In the case where he does not want to commit suicide, he is jumping in order to do something life-threatening because he believes that the act will insure that he does something that has a small chance of taking his life. Objection 5: (James Rachels11) Smith, a pro fessional gambler who loves his style of life, will not place a bet on a really sure thing since the thrill of gambling would not be present. Hence, because of condition (4) just added to deal with the fourth objection Smith does not bet in order to make money. But this consequence is odd given that Smith would be very disappointed if he were to lose. Smith's purpose is complex: he wishes to win money in a situation in which he might lose. And this is his purpose on my analysis. He is different from Jones who would bet on a sure thing and my analysis describes this difference by saying that Jones bets in order to win money; Smith does not, but Smith is betting to bring about the complex result "uncertain victory." If, on the other hand, Smith bets when he knows he will lose, then he is obviously not betting to win. (Thus, Smith's belief would be expressed conjunctively whereas a dual purpose would be expressed disjunctively.) Objection 6 : Condition (2) is too strong because a man may act for an end even when he knows he will fail. A person in a concentration camp, for example, may feel that he must try to escape even if he is convinced that his attempt is futile. In order for this case to be a counterexample, the man must really believe at the time of action that he has no chance of success. A man may believe this before the action, but not as he really pro ceeds with the attempt. Secondly, we must dis tinguish the man whose purpose is escape from cases of "going through the motions," i.e., cases of people whose purpose is the expression of their dignity or a certain effect on other inmates or, perhaps, suicide. It is not easy to decide whether or not there can be a genuine counter-example, therefore. This man must be bobbing and weaving in order to escape, and also be absolutely convinced that his efforts are futile. But this objection, I believe, can be emas culated. For if a person believes that this man is bobbing and weaving in order to escape, he will change condition (2) to: Either P believes at t that A has some chance of bringing x about or P believes at t that A would have had some chance of bringing x 10 In conversation. 11 In conversation.</page><page sequence="7">PURPOSIVE ACTION 317 about under different conditions. This new causal thesis is only slightly weakened because, for example, a man going to college in order to become a lawyer is not also going in order to become a doctor just because he believes that, had he wanted to be a doctor, going to college would probably lead to his becoming a doctor. This belief must also be a condition of his going to college (in order to become a lawyer) and it is not. Objection 7 : (R. Abelson12) We say of animals that they act for ends; yet we do not ascribe beliefs to animals, and, a fortiori, we do not ascribe beliefs regarding probabilities. But we do, in everyday talk, ascribe beliefs to animals. We hesitate, upon reflection, to think of these beliefs as full-blooded because they do not involve dispositions to talk, i.e., to use language. But dispositions to act and, to some extent, to feel are present and so animals have beliefs in an emasculated sense of the term. The absence of language restricts the possible content of an animal's belief and makes us, therefore, hesitate to ascribe beliefs regarding probabilities to animals. Hence, the analysis of "in order to" talk for animals will have to refer to beliefs of a simpler structure. I do, however, think that ascription of purpose and ascription of belief go hand in hand. If we became convinced that animals cannot have beliefs in any sense, we would construe ascription of purposes to them as anthropomorphic. In this regard, it is interesting to note that, according to C. Taylor, our ascription of purposes to animals is justified by the failure of psychologists to develop adequate theories that eschew intentional concepts like belief.13 Objection 8 : There are several serious difficulties that fall under a single heading we might label the problem of subsidiary purposes. Suppose I have worked out in detail an itinerary for a trip from New York to California and, as I start out, some one asks me why I am going into the Lincoln Tunnel. I might specify an immediate purpose, e.g., to get to the New Jersey Turnpike, or I might specify the ultimate goal, to get to California. But it would sound very odd to say "to get to the Indiana Turnpike." On my analysis, however, all of these answers are equally legitimate because, on my analysis, they are all my purposes. Now this difficulty is not terribly serious. There is a sense in which my purpose is to get to the Indiana Turnpike. The reason it sounds odd is that the selection of one of so many intermediate goals seems arbitrary. So we do use criteria to select certain purposes and rule out others and my analysis has not taken this into account. Why? There are three reasons, (i) As I just said, there is a sense in which every intermediate step neces sary to the attainment of a goal is a purpose in some sense. (2) There is an element of personal relativity that plays an important role in the selection of the purpose or purposes. The selection varies with the way in which an individual classifies or divides his situation. If, on my itinerary, I thought of the Indiana Turnpike as the end of the first leg of the journey, it would not be unnatural to speak of arriving there as my purpose. Or the division of the activity may have a lot to do with social or legal conventions. For example, if I were asked my pur pose in taking the Saw Mill River Parkway this afternoon, I could say "It will get me to the Henry Hudson" or "It will get me to the West Side High way" or "It will get me to New York"; but it would sound very odd to say "It will get me to the section of the Saw Mill that goes through the Northern half of Yonkers" because that section of road has no special name. There is also a con textual component in our selection of the end or final goal of our activity. On my analysis, if I would have given up the trip to the Indiana Turn pike upon learning that it will not get me to California, then getting to California is a goal; but if I would have given up the trip to California upon coming to discover that California would not make me happy, then happiness is also a purpose of my entering the Lincoln Tunnel. So it looks as if Indiana and California are on a par. But there is still a sense in which the stages of the trip are merely means to the goal of getting to California. (3) Other principles are at work; but none of them is sacrosanct in the sense that the personal and contextual considerations mentioned above can override the failure of these principles as the follow ing examples show. One principle seems to be that a consequence to which the person has an aversion, but which he believes to be a means to something he wants, will not be called a purpose. I do not enter the store to rid myself of some money; but that is the only way I can get what I want. Here, again, is a connection between purposiveness and desire. If, however, the D 12 In conversation. 13 G.

A person who works at an un pleasant job only to earn money certainly sees himself as leaving the house in order to go to work. Consider another principle. We do not normally view a consequence of our action that is believed to be necessary for some goal as a purpose if the con sequence is a natural, unlearned by-product of our activity. I may believe that I would not eat an apple unless I first salivate; but I do not think of myself as going to the refrigerator in order to salivate. Similarly, however, we can imagine a case where salivation is a goal, e.g., somebody asks me to salivate and I can only do this at the sight of food. So I go to the refrigerator to get an apple. I may in fact have a dual purpose if the request was made just before I had decided to get an apple from the refrigerator in order to eat it. Evidently there is room here for work. It is clear to me that I have only scratched the surface in regard to this problem of subsidiary purposes. But, and this is the important point, I cannot believe that subsequent investigations will necessitate the abandonment of my analysis of purposive action. They will require modification and refinement of that analysis. The case for a Chisholm-type analy sis, however, it seems plain, must be made on other grounds. And we have examined these grounds already and found them wanting. I would claim, therefore, that Objection 8 has been emasculated. Objection 9 : (M. Slote and E. Leites14) Suppose a man believes that if he were to write a certain sort of letter to Richard Nixon, Nixon would probably proceed to escalate the Vietnamese war. He does not write this letter for some reason whose nature is not at the moment pertinent. The most obvious reason would be that he does not want the war to be escalated. He is then hypnotized and the hypno tist commands him to do whatever he believes will probably escalate the war. When he wakes up, he proceeds to write this letter. Call this Case I. On my analysis, we would have to say that he wrote the letter in order to escalate the war even in the case where he wants the war to end. An even stranger case would be one in which the man does not believe the letter will have the escalating effect, is caused by the hypnotist to have this belief, and again is commanded to do what ever he believes will probably produce an escalation of the war. Call this Case II. On my analysis, we would again have to say that he wrote the letter in order to escalate the war even if he wants the war to end. I call these cases "alleged counterexamples" because it is not clearly false that the letters are written in order to escalate the war. The belief that the letters will have this effect must be included in an explanation of the action. It is not enough to cite the fact that the hypnotist commanded the man, say Jones, to do whatever he, Jones, believes will escalate the war. To explain the act of writing the letter, we must mention the fact that Jones believes that this specific act will probably bring on escalation. In Case II it is not enough to say that the hypnotist caused him to have the belief unless you suppose, per my analysis, that the belief is guiding the action in the sense that it is still present when he acts and is a condition of the act. And the questions "Why is he trying to escalate the war?" or "Why is he acting on that belief?" are different from the question "Why is he writing the letter?" Perhaps we feel that the act was not done voluntarily. But purposive acts can be involuntary. For example, a man can be coerced to reach into his wallet for money. So the feeling we have about the two cases may have to do with matters other than purposiveness. I shall nonetheless try to emasculate this objec tion by showing that any feature of these cases that leads us to suppose that the acts are not purposive can be referred to in a version of the causal thesis. Evidently a person can do A in order to effect B without being able to specify all the conditions of his doing A. He may, for example, be ignorant of certain neurological requirements. So the fact that Jones cannot specify a sufficient condition of the act of writing the letter is not the feature that in clines us to say that he is not acting purposively. Nor is the fact that another human being has produced the conditions that, together with existing conditions, add up to a sufficient condition of the action. For this feature is present when one human being commands, convinces, persuades, or brain washes another human being to do something. And surely when Smith convinces Jones he should write the letter, Jones writes the letter in order to escalate the war. Perhaps what disturbs us then is the way in which the hypnotist has bypassed Jones's psyche. Smith had to take Jones's intelligence, personality, and belief system into account in order to convince 14 In conversation.</page><page sequence="9">PURPOSIVE ACTION 319 him to write the letter; the hypnotist did not. This feature would also explain why we would be equally disturbed if the effect on Jones had been produced by physical manipulation of his brain rather than hypnosis. The hypnotist (i) may have induced the perti nent desire in Jones without regard to Jones's present intelligence and personality (except certain minimal conditions like Jones's ability to under stand the hypnotist's directions) or (2) he may have caused Jones to write the letter without inducing the desire to escalate the war in him. The reason other techniques of personality change, e.g., psychoanalysis, do not disturb us in the same way is that they must work on present personality and intelligence in order to bring such results about. (1) is vague. Suppose I tell Brown that he should go to 412 W. 113th Street because they blop there and it's really great. Now Brown does not know what blopping is; but he takes my word for it (he need not even generally trust me) and forms the desire to blop or to do whatever I was referring to. This desire was induced independently of his per sonality and intelligence. He cannot perhaps be highly cautious or distrustful; but these kinds of character traits might be necessary for the effective ness of hypnosis or brain surgery. Surely, though, when Brown goes to 412 W. 113th Street, he is going to blop. Perhaps then ( 1 ) should be replaced by (3) : The action is directed by a desire that was induced non rationally, i.e., by means other than persuasion or the advancing of arguments, etc., whether the reasons and arguments be good or bad. Besides the fact that the distinction between rational and non-rational inducement is very vague once we leave the arena of clear cases, there is the obvious objection that innately-based desires or needs are not produced rationally although a man seeking food, say, is surely acting purposively. (3) may have to give way to (4), therefore. Per haps there must be an essential reference to another person in the genesis of the desire. We are not bothered about innate desires. But we might be bothered about the creation of desires by another person, e.g., the hypnotist. In other words, we are disturbed about manipulation, not causation per se. If a man's brain happened to be in the state that the hypnotist produced in Jones, we should not be disturbed about that man's purposiveness if (4) is the answer. In order to define (4), we must again distinguish manipulation from persuasion, argumentation, and even coercion, for these latter do not preclude purposiveness. Perhaps (3) provides us with a clue. Perhaps the creation of a desire for x in Jones by a hypnotist or brain surgeon is manipulation because it does not depend on the presence of formation of a belief in Jones that x would be satisfying in some way. This type of belief was necessary in order for Brown to form the desire to blop, but is not neces sary when the desire is not created by another person, e.g., an innately-based desire. Suppose, however, that the hypnotist creates both the desire to x and the belief that x would be satisfying in some way. Again we may feel that the hypnotist is the only "real agent" in the situation, especially in Case II where he also creates in Jones the belief that his action will have the desired effect. When a man creates in another certain desires or beliefs, but is not engaged in manipulation, there is the assumption that he is constrained to some extent by the man's present intelligence, capacities, personality, and belief system. Although we have failed to define these constraints, it seems to me that this conclusion constitutes an emasculation of the objection. For the kind of condition we would have to add to the definition of purposiveness would say roughly that if P's action has a desire or belief as a condition, and if either is created by another person (or person-like entity or entity believed to be a person if Jones can be induced to perform a non purposive action by a robot whom Jones believes is human), then at the time of creation, other con ditions of the creation are aspects A, B, and C of P's intelligence, capacities, personality, and belief system. I see no inroads here for primitivism. Restrictions on the power of an agent other than P would also be required to reply to an objection similar to the present one.15 Suppose God or some powerful being simply makes it the case that P does A whenever it happens to be the case that P has the appropriate belief and, perhaps, other conditions are satisfied. Again, it is difficult to say exactly how we should formulate the appropriate restric tions. But it seems clear that these restrictions will not imply or suggest primitivism. We have not yet dealt with (2), the suggestion that the disturbing feature is the action's not being directed by any desire or reason, although caused by the hypnotist (a situation that may also hold in the God case). If purposive actions have to be 15 M.

This conflict is only appar ent because the adoption of this suggestion would require us to view an action as non-purposive if it does not proceed from desire and is produced in a way that violates our restrictions.
