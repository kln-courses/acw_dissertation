<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles Segai The Problem of thè Gods in Euripidee9 H ecuba One of thè most difficult problems in the interprétation of Euripidean tragedy is the role and meaning of the gods. The difficulties raised by the onstage appearance of divinities in plays like the Hippolytus, Héraclès, and Bacchae are notorious. The use of the deus ex machina in plays like Electra, Ion, the two IphigeneiaSy or Orestes complicates rather than résolves the hard moral questions of the action. Plays in which thè gods are in thè background and make no direct appearânce or interven- tion, like the Medea or the Hecuba, the work with which we are concerned here, might seem to be freer of such problems. In fact, the opposite is the case. As many scholars have noted, Euripides' theology is so imbued with what is rather vaguely called his irony that there is little likelihood of universal agreement1. Always a dramatist - and an original and inventive dramatist - Euripides is interested in the range and diversity of religious expérience2. Thus the Hecuba who in our play can appeal to a universal law which (on one reading of the passage) is anterior even to the worship of the gods (Hec. 799-805) can, in the TroadeSy invoke Zeus as an impersonal «necessity of .nature», a kind of cosmic force operating remotely and mysteriously in human affairs (Tro. 886). But Euripides can also imagine the intensely private, almost mystical relation between a mortai and a particular goddess, such as that between Hippolytus and 1. G.

Or he can directly attack the baser aspect of the traditional anthropomorphic myths through the vengeful crüelty of Hera in the Héraclès (cf. 847 ff.), only to hâve his hero himself turn his back on this view of the gods in the name of a higher moral- ity (HF 1340-46). In a famous ode of the Hippolytus Euripides présents the chorus of Hippolytus' hunter-companions as torn by conflict between their pious hope in thè «gods' care» for mortals and their agonized questioning of the randomness of human suffer- ing as they «look on the fortunes of mortals» (1 104-1 1 10), espe- cially the misfortunes before their eyes3. Hère thè attempi to résolve the discrepancy between thè comfort of pious belief and the actuality of meaningless suffering produces a deep spiritual malaise. And within our play even an enemy, the herald Talth- ybius, looking upon Hecuba's reversais, wonders whether Zeus or chance governs human life (488-91, with the generally accepted deletion of 490). Writing in the âge of the Sophistic questioning of traditional values, Euripides may well here be reflecting the troubled mood of his contemporaries, or at least of those who were touched by the contemporary rationalistic currents and were also earnest, décent Citizens committed to the state religion and concerned to make moral, intellectual, and spiritual sensé of their world. Because Euripides' gods appear not only as an independent reality in the world but also as features of personal belief and attitudes that define the emotional and moral make-up of his characters, no single généralisation or categorization will be adequate. Euripides often constructs his action in such a way that arguments for and against divine justice are equally possi- ble. His concern, then, seems to be less with shaping a conclu- sive theology than with creating an interlocking structure of events, attitudes, and supernatural forces that makes us deeply 3. This passage is much discusseci. See W. S. Barrett, Euripides, Hippolytos, Ox- ford 1964, ad 1.; C. W. Willink, Some Problems of Text and Interpretation in Hippolytus, «Class.

The dominant situation in the first part of thè Hecuba is a supernatural demand for a human sacrifice. But, as in Euri- pides' other sacrifice plays, human sacrifice is as much a reflec- tion on a corrupt human world as an incrimination of gods who demand human victims. The divine Orders for the sacrifice of the young, particularly of innocent virgins, depict a debased human world, driven by personal ambition, unscrupulous de- sire for power, and pride. The suffering that the gods hère re- quire from the innocent and immature, not from the mature, manly warriors of the Homeric type, shows us a world from which heroism has disappeared or is displaced to unexpected areas and paradoxical situations among those whose lives would normally hâve no contact with the heroic world4. Euripides, to be sure, often présents the gods as independent- ly existing beings who hâve complex, anthropomorphic rela- tions among one another in ordering the human world. Such are the quarrel between Aphrodite and Artemis in the Hippoly- tus (especially 1416-23), or the divine assembly that will decide Helen's fate in Helen 878 ff., or the new collaboration of Athe- na and Poseidon in the prologue to the Troades. But he never loses sight of the meaning of the gods as a mirror in which man views his own nature, and especially his moral nature. Although it may be an exaggeration to claim that thè gods are «an essentially human problem», as Chapouthier does5, it is fair to say that the way in which différent figures invoke and de- scribe the gods is as much a comment on their individuai char- acters as an attempt to sketch a cohérent theology. The gods (inter alia) provide a large and independent field in which char- acters reveal their most constant and basic values. In thè Hip- polytusy for example, the maie protagonist's manner of addres- sing Artemis and Aphrodite at once establishes his values, and with them the strengths and weaknesses of his personality.

In the Hecuba the strongest instance of this use of the gods as a mirror of individuai moral character is the entrance of Polymestor (953 ff.). This man, who has shockingly outraged both divine and human law, has as virtually his first words on- stage a generalization about the moral chaos of the world. One cannot trust in anything, he says, for «the gods themselves mix everything up ... so that it is through ignorance that we revere them» (ώς άγνωσίςι σέβωμεν αυτούς, 957-60). We realize at once that we are dealing with a man for whom religious sanctions have no meaning. He is simply lacking in moral awareness, and these opening Statements about the gods show us this deficien- cy of a criminal personality. He projects his own moral dis- order upon the gods. He is like the incorrigible criminal of Pro- tagoras* myth in Plato's dialogue, who has to «be killed as being a disease of thè city», since «he cannot share in justice and re- verence» {Protag. 322d). It is appropriate, then, that this socio- pathic, homicidal figure is in fact cast completely outside of human society, to a désert island 1284 ff.). The amoral, Macchiavellian politician, Odysseus, makes vir- tually no mention of the gods (the allusion to Persephone in 136 hardly counts), but argues for martial honor as a socially useful principle, even if that involves the barbarous practice of human sacrifice (306 ff.). He sees no religious dimension at ail in obeying thè command òf Achilles* ghost. He insists drily only on the practical results of the deed, keeping the Greek state strong by honoring the best warriors (306-31). He may follow the outward forms of piety (cf. 342-45), but he honors these more in the létter thah in the spirit. Hence he will accept Hecuba's supplication only in the most limited, legalistic sensé: her life in exchange for his, and nothing more (301 f.). In 342-45 it is significantly Polyxena, not Odysseus, who refers to the efficacy of the suppliant gesture and to «Zeus god of sup- pliants». The chorus, with the piety born of desperation, urges Hecu- ba to use her suppliant status, to go the temples, and to «cali on 6.

As they reflect on their city's suffering in the second stasimon, they blâme Helen's «private folly» (641 ff.) and trace the cycle of events back to the quarrel of the three goddesses and the judgment of Paris (644-49). At the end of the third stasimon they return to Helen, curse her, and cali her marriage the «woe from some alastor (947 f.). In neither case do they give much emphasis to divine causation. As women who hâve led a shel- tered life, they hâve conventional views of the gods; and they hâve no means of self-protection other than the traditional sanctions against the violation of suppliants, to which Hecuba too makes appeal (287-90). They gloat over Polymestor's punishment as the triumph of «Justice and the gods» (1028). Yet they are not interested in probing more deeply into the questions of divine justice. Even when they look back as far as the judgement of Paris (644 ff.), they close the stasimon with the very human reflection that in Greece too a girl is weeping in bereavement at home or a mother is tearing her cheeks in the mourning ritual for a dead son (647-57). In this respect they are very différent from an Aeschylean chorus. Hecuba herself is, as one would expect, the most complex of all the characters in her view of the gods. Her tragedy circums- cribes the arc from her appeals to traditional piety in the first half of the play (e. g. 287 ff., mentioned above) to the horrible, if justified, vengeance that she exacts from the murderer of her son. She pronounces one of Euripides' füllest and most cele- brated déclarations of universal moral principles deriving from the divine order - her appeal to nomos in 799-8057. On the one hand, she seems to make nomos a principle of justice «that rules even the gods» (799); on the other hand, her language suggests the Sophistic théories of the relativity of «custom» by which every people has its own view of what the gods are (νόμω γαρ τους θεούς ηγούμεθα, 800)8. Soon afterwards she moves from 7.

It is in fact the latter - the obligation that Agamemnon feels toward her as the mother of his spear-prize, Cassandra - that proves most effective in enlist- ing his aid in the vengeance. When Hecuba wins Agamemnon over to her cause, he wants, he says, to see the criminal punished «for the sake of the gods» and «for the sake of justice» (851 f.). But he qualifies this moral purpose at once with the need for keeping up appearances, since Polymestor is a Greek ally (854-63). Hère too the invoca- tion of gods reflects on the human reality: the concern of a well-meaning but morally weak leader to maintain his position and avoid «being slandered» before the Greek army. In the lat- ter case, he wams, he will be but a «sluggish» ally (863). When Agamemnon pronunces his final judgment against Polymestor and in favor of Hecuba, he validâtes her peroration, accusing Polymestor as a man «neither pious nor trustworthy to those to whom he should have been, nor holy, nor just» (1234 f., cf. 852 f.). But are we so sure that Agamemnon's judg- ment really affirms the Greek army's practice of the moral and religious values implied bythese verses? We recali his vacilla- tion earlier (861-63), and his ulterior motives with regard to Cassandra (855; cf. 826-32). And this is, after all, a society which permits human sacrifice, betrays the most sacred laws of civilized life, and seems almost completely incapable of noble, disinterested moral action for its own sake. The prologue informs us at once that the son of the warrior whose honor is the central motif of the first half of the play has sacrificed Priam at the «god-built altars» (23 f.) - a foresha- dowing of another human sacrifice at an aitar, and with the same slayer (534 ff.). Hecuba's appeals to the sanctities of the suppliant and to thè horror of human sacrifice have no effect (cf. 145 ff., 260 ff., 287 ff.). For thèse reasons, among others, scholars consider this play among the darkest of Euripides' works. Like the Trojan Women, it asks what Günther Zuntz calls «the desperate question which is at the heart of all of Euri- pides' works; the question: how is man to live in a godless world?»9. 121; more recently Malcolm Heath, 'Jure Principem Locum Tenet': Euripides' Hecuba, «Bull. Inst. Class. St. London» 34, 1987, p. 67. 9. Zuntz (above, note 1) p. 215.</page><page sequence="7">The Problem of thè Gods in Euripidei* H ecuba 15 Remote as thè gods are in this play, there are several places, in fact, where Euripides directly or indirectly raises thè ques- tion of their intervention in human affairs. As we shall see, however, thè relation among thèse passages brings out thè re- moteness and obscurity of thè divine will. In thè prologue, first of ali, thè shade of Polydorus explains how he has «requested of thè gods in power below to obtain burial and come into (his) mother's hands» (48 f.). These chtho- nic gods have allowed him to visit thè upper world, where he brings to Hecuba her disquieting nocturnal visions (cf. 68 ff.). In due course, his body does come into her hands for burial (657 ff.). To this extent thè gods are merciful10. But thèse are only thè gods of thè lower world, and what they grant is burial (which is properly what lies in their power), not, for instance, thè salvation of thé child for which Hecuba prays to them soon after. The recovery of Polydorus' corpse is obviously essential for uncovering Polymestor's crime and thus for bringing him to justice11. But Euripides présents it only within thè limited framework of thè chthonic intervention promised in thè pro- logue, not as part of a broader scheme of divine justice12. Addressing Hecuba herseif in his last Unes (as she will later apostrophize him, 736), Polydorus suggests that «some one of the gods» may be causing her présent suff ering, to counterba- lance her previous good fortune (57 f.). This appeal to the tradi- tional notion of the φθόνος θεών puts the question of theodicy into the foreground, but hardly suggests a satisfactory solution. Earlier in the prologue, in fact, Polydorus attributes the suffer- ing of the play's most innocent and pathetic victim, Polyxena, to a remote, impersonal «destiny» (43 f.): ή πεπρωμένη δ'άγει / θανείν άδελφήν τω δ' έμήν έν ήματι. Later, after the discovery of Polydorus' body, the chorus attributes Hecuba's terrible suf- 10. Cf. Aesch. Pers. 688-92, where thè gods of the lower world also relent, though their austerity and reluctance are stressed. They are presumably also merciful in Euripides' lost Protesilaus. 11. See Heath (above, note 8) pp. 66 f. 12. The only textual évidence that divine justice is at work in thè recovery of Polydorus' body is perhaps the séquence of thought in 790 ff., especially 797-801. After accusing Polymestor of impiety and of «not fearing the gods below the earth nor those above» (791), Hecuba cites his having cast his victim 's corpse into the sea (άφηκε πόντιον, 797) and only two lines later asserts the gods' strength and the power of Law (799 f.). But even here thè link is far from explicit.</page><page sequence="8">16 Charles Segai fering to some «divinity» of her ili fortune (720 f.): «Ο poor woman, how whatever divinity (daimon) that is heavy upon y ou has made y ou most suf fering of mortals». Speaking from the other side of the division between life and death, Polydorus can describe this murder with the distance and objectivity of a shade. Hecuba, however, views thèse divine dispositions with the raw grief of a mother. Thus when Odys- seus announces the girl's impending sacrifice, Hecuba gives the bitterest possible intepretation to the gods' role in human life. She refers not to some vague «god», as did Polydorus' shade (θεών τις, 58), but incriminâtes Zeus himself. He did not permit her to die, as she would hâve liked, but has kept her alive so that she may witness sufferings of which each is worse than the last (232 f.): ούδ' ώλεσέν με Ζευς, τρέφει δ', όπως όρώ κακών κάκ' άλλα μείζον' ή χάλαιν* έγώ. So too Hecuba's plea for «some god» to come as helper (163 f.) will not be heeded. After thèse failures of her intense prayers for the lives of her children, she does not again pray to the gods, even though, as we hâve seen, she invokes the gods as principles of justice in her appeal to Agamemnon (799 ff.; cf. 1234 ff.). Once having de- cided on revenge, she does not expect divine aid. The powers she invokes are Kypris (825 ff.), as an allegorization of sex, and Peitho, the true « tyran t for men» (816 ff.). The chorus, at the moment of Polymestor's punishment, combines Justice, as a personified force, with the gods (το ύπέγγυον Δίκς* και θεοισιν, 1028 f.), but for Hecuba herseif dike is human rather than di- vine justice. Impiety and disregard for the gods bulk large in Hecuba's initial accusation of Polymestor (790-92); and Agamemnon agrées to help her «for the sake of the gods and justice» (θεών θ' οΰνεκα... / και του δικαίου, 852 f.; cf. 1234 f.). But the gods disappear from his final judgment (1240-54). The first stage in Hecuba's just revenge is often interpreted as owing something to divine aid. Her revenge is possible, as Agamemnon allows, because «the god is not sending the favor- able winds» (ου γαρ ϊησ' ούριους πνοας θεός, 900). The suspe- sion of the winds by a «god» is ail the more striking because hitherto the agent of thè cairn has been the shade of Achilles (cf. 37-39, 109-115; cf. 538-41). Once more, however, the allusion</page><page sequence="9">The Problem of thè Gods in Euripides' H ecuba 17 to divine collaboration is by no means certain. The passage can be read as a hint of thè gods' interest, remote as it is, in having justice done. Or it can also reflect on Agamemnon's flaccid commitment to morality. He will aid thè cause of justice if it brings him no inconvenience, and his help dépends on such an external contingency as the winds. The two possibilities are by no means mutually exclusive. In fact, taken together, they show Euripides using the gods simultaneously to raise the problem of a moral world-order and to reveal human character: men show what they are by the way in which they speak of the gods. Closely connected with this passage is thè closing scene of the play. After Polymestor's terrible prophecies about Hecu- ba's transformation and thè murder of Cassandra and Agamemnon on his retürn to Argos, the latter announces that he sees «the favorable winds (blowing) homeward» (και γαρ πνοάς / προς οίκον ήδη τάσδε πομπίμους όρώ 1289 f.). The echo of 900 is important and intentional. Euripides is again raising thè possibility that divine powers are somehow in thè back- ground, eventually punishing the Greeks for the atrocities they hâve committed at Troy13. On closer inspection, however, di- vine intervention is as obscure and ambiguous as it was in the previous passage. The only future sufferers hère are Cassandra, who is a totally innocent victim, and Agamemnon, who is guil- ty, to be sure, as the leader of the army, but within the framework of the play has been the gentlest of the Greeks. The chief agents of Hecuba's sufferings hâve been Odysseus, the strongest sponsor of sacrificing Polyxena (131 ff.), and the two sons of Theseus, from Athens (123 f.), who do not appear in the play. At the end Agamemnon says nothing of the gods, as he had in 900. He says only, «I see the winds». If the gods are working in thè background, then, they are working in mysterious ways. Agamemnon is totally blind to them; it is as if he «sees» thè material aspect of the world, but not the invisible power, poss- ibly moral powers, beyond them. The only one to hâve any vision of thèse powers is the greedy, treacherous Thracian king, who claims Dionysus, «prophet to the Thracians», as his authority14. Polymestor is the most unworthy possible vehicle 13. Kovacs (above, note 1) p. 110. 14. Polymestor does not say explicitly that Dionysus is a god hère; perhaps (like</page><page sequence="10">18 Charles Segai of thè gods* will. This parodistic verison of thè deus ex machina gives little assurance of divine justice15. The prophecies that he announces are given not to implement justice, but to compen- sate for his helplessness and encompass his own revenge against those who hâve punished his crime. The agency of Dionysus is part of a pattern of bacchic motifs that runs throughout thè play. Cassandra is described repeated- ly as subject to bacchantic madness (121, 676 f.; cf. 827). Hecu- ba will sing a «bacchic tune» of dirges over her daughter's body (684-87). More powerful still is the description of the Trojan women as Bacchants when they attack Polymestor and his sons. He calls them «Bacchants of Hades» (1077). His account of their deed, in his wild lyrics, makes it resemble a Dionysiac sparagmos (1078 ff.). The collective violence of this iemale attack also has äff inities with maenadic violence (cf. 1156 ff., especially πλήθει γυναικών 1167). These Dionysiac éléments, however, like Polymestor's Dionysiac prophecy in 1267, though in the service of justice, are deeply imbued by the all too human passions of violent revenge. And in thè background, again, is a helpless and innocent victim, the «bacchic» Cas- sandra. The mention of other divinities in the play gives as little clear assurance of divine justice. The chorus describes their prayer to Artemis at the fall of Troy; but this prayer, they say, went unanswered (935 f.). In the first stasimon, in fact, they speculate anxiously on their future toil as slaves in this goddess's shrine on Delos (458 ff.). Hecuba will lure Polymestor to his doom by the promise of treasure hidden by a black stone near Athena's temple at Troy (1008 f.). Yet it is not the goddess who is aveng- ing her city's ruin, but the human plotter who is enlisting the goddess's name in her own scheme of vengeance. Hecuba may relish using a sacred place to punish a man who has trampled on divine and human laws. Yet this référence to Athena's temple among what is now a heap of smoking ruins (cf. 476-78, 823, Pentheus) he does not fully grasp his divine status. Herodotus 7.111 mentions a manteion of Dionysus among the Thracians. 15. For Polymestor's rôle as deus ex machina see Wilhelm Schmid in W. Schmid and Otto Stählin, Geschichte der griechischen Literatur 1.3, Munich 1940, p. 472 and, in a lighter vein, G. H.

Iliad 6.297-311). Athena, like Artemis, is a divinity whose festivals they will adorn as slaves (466 ff.; cf. 458 ff. and supra). The gods, to be sure, are not forgotten. The suspension of the winds has something to do with supernatural forces, even if we do not know exactly what they are. Their return may be due to powers greater than the shade of Achilles (cf. 900). Even after thè appeasement of Achilles' shade, the winds held off long enough to allow Hecuba to work her hard justice on Poly- mestor. And the lower gods' granting of Polydorus' request for burial does eventually bring about justice. We cannot say that the good are rewarded, as Agamemnon would hâve it in his superficial pietism of 902-4; y et evil does seem to be punished. Evil, in fact, seems to contain the seeds of its own self-destruction. Polymestor reenacts his earlier greed for Trojan gold, so that his own vice becomes the instrument of his punishment. Thus in trapping him Hecuba cleverly brings together the gold stolen from Polydorus (994) and the lure of still more gold at Troy (1002, 1009). The appearance of Poly- dorus' shade in the prologue, as we hâve observed, at least raises the possibility of just and merciful gods, in the lower if not in the upper world. The disposition of the cosmos into its several zones of divine control in the opening Unes can imply a hierarchical world-order that is reconcilable with divine justice (iv' "Αιδης χωρίς ψκισται θεών 2). The broader reaches of the action, leading back to Paris and Helen and forward to Agamemnon and Clytaemnestra in Mycene, could be made to imply something like an Aeschylean pattern of retributive justice extending from one crime to another. But Euripides does not develop such reflections at any length16. The justice that lies in the future appears primarily through the intended cruelty and revenge of Polymestor against Hecuba. Polymestor reports thèse prophecies not in the name of justice, but to inflict pain on his enemies. His main target is not the Greek generai but the bereaved Trojan mother, via another innocent victim, her last surviving child, Cassandra17. 16. Cf. 1028-30, 1085 f. 1 7. On the cruelty and personal enmities in this closing scene, with its «atmosfera</page><page sequence="12">20 Charles Segai Over Agamemnon's closing announcement of setting sail, it has been suggested, hangs thè threat of thè god-sent storm that will wreck the fleet and thus avenge the atrocities done here18. But in fact Euripides withholds any such assurance. There is no référence to the storm or shipwrecks of Odyssey 3.151 ff. or 4.499 ff.; nor hâve we any indication that such events are re- levant here. Euripides' stresses the personal sufferings of Agamemnon back home in Greece (cf. 1277), not at sea. In fact the one person for whom the chorus prays for zfailed voyage «home» (èç οίκον, 952), namely Helen, has (so far as this play indicates) an ultimately happy return over the sea (950-52): άν μήτε πέλαγος άλιον άπαγάγοι πάλιν, μήτε πα- τρψον ΐκοιτ' ές οίκον. And we are reminded of their bitterness in the previous ode about the beautiful Helen's safe crossing of the sea as Paris' bride (ίχλιον έπ' οίδμα ναυστολήσων / Έλένας έπί λέκτρα, 634 f.). In sharp contrast to the chorus' impotent prayer against Helen's return here in the third stasimon stands their lament, in thè same ode, over their own sea- voyage into slavery (937-41): άγομαι δέ ϋανόντ' ίδούσ' άκοίταν τον έμον άλιον έπί πέλαγος, πόλιν τ' αποσκοπούσ', έπε! νόστιμον ναϋς έκίνησεν πόδα και μ' άπο γάς ώρισεν Ίλιάδος. This crüel discrepancy between the two crossings of the sea, underlined by the verbal echoes between 937 f. and 950, depicts the frustrations of the chorus' demand for justice and, by im- plication, the refusai of the gods to hear their prayers. Alongside the intimations of the justice of the gods in this play, then, are also their remoteness and their inscrutability. What Euripides does show us at the end is the blindness of men: the physical blindness of the justly and savagely punished Polymestor, the moral blindness of thè Greek king and generai, di cupa desolazione», see Vincenzo Di Benedetto, Euripide: teatro e società, Torino 1971, p. 101. 18.

In such a world the human actors are left alone, to work out their own solutions to the evil and de- gradation around them. Men and women's bad moral disposi- tions - whether the resuit of innate character (in thè case of Polymestor) or circumstances (in the case of Hecuba) - are the chief déterminant of thè suff ering that we see enacted before us: thè murders, betrayals, rape, enslavement that follow in the wake of war. The wrongdoers' own baser passions, however, will eventually lead them to their own destruction. The gods, invisible and anonymous, may be viewed as creat- ing the circumstances that favor this process of retributive jus- tice, but Euripides leaves the question open. Hère, as else- where, he does not give us an unambiguous theology. For those who die a painful death in innocence, like Polydorus or Polymestor's children, or in nobility and generosity of spirit, like Polyxena, there may be vengeance, but there is no pallia- tion of suffering. The gods below may help Polydorus obtain burial, but to him and his family, while alive, they hâve seemed indifferent. It is characteristic of the mood of the Hecuba that Euripides présents this remoteness of the gods not primarily as a theolo- gical problem but from the perspective of the human victims. One of antiquity's most sensitive and attentive readers of Euri- pides' Trojan plays found the epic équivalent of thèse distant tragic gods. When thè Greek attack lays bare the vulnérable city of Troy, the halls resound with the wailing of the women, but their cries arouse no compassion in thè heavens: ferii aurea sidéra clamor (Virgil, Aeneid 2.488). When we do see the gods, it is an ugly and fearful sight, and one that has its origins as much in Euripides as in Homer: apparent dirae facies inimicaque Troiae numina magna deum. (Aen. 2.622 f.).
