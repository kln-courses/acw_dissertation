Brian Richardson’s Unnatural Voices: Extreme Narration in Modern and Contem- porary Fiction problematizes traditional narrative theory’s reliance on an anthropo- morphic conceptualization of the narrator and the presupposition of a mimetic narrative  situation. Richardson argues that narrative theory has not kept up with developments  in narration and he proposes a new, expanded system of classification. Through a rigor- ous inductive approach to argumentation, Richardson indicates deviations from the  humanistic norm. In the process, his study catalogues literary innovations in narration  throughout the century with equal attention to established literary figures and lesser- known authors alike. Keywords: narrative theory / postmodernism / modernism / anthropomorphism Since its inception, narrative theory has relied heavily on the conceptualization of the narrator as “someone” who speaks. The humanistic identity of the nar-rating agent and the mimetic quality of narration have both been central to  a narratological understanding of fictional and dramatic texts. However, the book  under review seeks to problematize the conventions of traditional narrative theory  that rely upon an anthropomorphic conceptualization of the narrator. In so doing,  Brian Richardson’s Unnatural Voices: Extreme Narration in Modern and Contempo- rary Fiction complicates the distinctions drawn among accepted classifications of  narrative person in modernist and postmodernist fiction and drama. Richardson’s project is as ambitious in its aims as it is expansive in its scope.  Unnatural Voices recognizes that much contemporary literature is “resistant to  traditional narrative theory” whose systems of classification are highly rigid and  seeks to “rectify the unfortunate absences” through a more fluid understanding of  the function of person in narration (ix). Richardson contends that as writers have  worked to create new and innovative approaches to narration, the lines between  the classifications of voice and narration have begun to blur. </page> <page sequence="2"> 142 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 4 Unnatural Voices is composed of eight chapters, each of which takes a rigor- ous inductive approach to argumentation. Richardson draws from a vast range of  examples in order to preserve his focus on what authors are actually doing with  narration, always with an eye to the historical context of the usage and without  much consideration for linguistics or rhetoric. While there is not room to review  the details of each chapter, it is necessary to highlight a few sections in order get a  sense of the extent of Richardson’s project. The first chapter begins with a compilation of inventive narrative techniques  in contemporary literature that Richardson views as constituting a shift from con- ventional humanistic narrating agents. He conceptualizes non-human narration as  that which crosses the boundaries of the traditional homo- or hetero-diegetic clas- sifications. The crux of his argument lies in his view that the systems of classifica- tion for the narrator used in traditional narrative theory are insufficient to describe  what Richardson calls the “unnatural” narrative situations of many modernist  and postmodernist texts. He argues that traditional narratological theory presup- poses a mimetic narrative situation, which he terms “natural,” but that many texts,  particularly postmodernist ones, have narrating agents that operate in ways that  a “human” narrator would or could not (62). Narrative theory has not, as it were,  kept up with narration. Richardson therefore proposes a new, expanded system of  classification and calls contemporary narrative theorists to embrace the sometimes  inherent ambiguity of narration that will always resist codification. The following three chapters deal with the different classifications of person  in more depth. The second chapter focuses on second-person narration as it has  evolved, and acknowledges and attempts to circumvent the problem inherent in  second-person narration in that it is a “distinctively literary phenomenon” (35). The  third chapter similarly traces first person plural, beginning with Conrad’s Narcissus  and examines the tendency of “we” narration to “valorize collective identity” (50).  With respect to both “you” and, to a greater degree, “we” narration, Richardson  examines the political implications of the persons and their usage by disenfran- chised and marginalized groups, due in part to the destabilizing nature of their  effect on the text. The fourth chapter continues in this vein in order to discuss more  recent developments in what Richardson terms “multiperson narration,” wherein  some combination of first, second and third person narrators are employed in one  text (62). Through this exploration, he also considers indeterminate speakers and  acts of narration that defy logical possibility. In this chapter, he presents a helpful,  comprehensive model wherein he situates the different voices in a way that clearly  illustrates the blurring of boundaries among the various traditional classifications  of person in narrative that he has described in the previous chapters (77). The fifth chapter, “Three Extreme Forms of Narration,” begins Richardson’s  exploration of more experimental forms of narration and “extreme narrating agents  which exist at the very boundaries of narration” (79). This chapter endeavors to clas- sify everything from disembodied voices in contemporary drama to “denarration, in  which the narrator negates or erases aspects of the world created by the narration”  (79). What is more, this section contains what is possibly the most innovative and  </page> <page sequence="3"> The Problem of the Human Narrator 143 compelling aspect of his work: the idea of postmodern unreliability. In the final  section of this chapter, Richardson expounds upon James Phelan’s work on unreli- ability to bring forth five types of narration that have heretofore defied definition:  what he calls fraudulent, contradictory, permeable, incommensurable and dis- framed (103–05). Unfortunately, his discussion of these classifications of narrating  agents is all too brief; these categories certainly deserve further exploration. The seventh chapter makes a compelling argument for the utility of Seymour  Chatman’s concept of the “implied author” and Wayne Booth’s “career implied  author” (which have fallen out of favor) through the examination of the body of  work of single authors. Richardson also approaches the subject of multiple implied  readers and its value to narrative theory. In what could be the most distinctive  feature of his theoretical approach, he calls us to “[break] through formalist barri- ers” in order to consider the practical usefulness of these concepts (132). As with  the rest of his project, Richardson is less concerned with a linguistics-oriented  understanding of the narrative transaction than with the more pragmatic issues of  the reader’s reception and processing of the narrative (114). Ultimately, Unnatural Voices’ most impressive accomplishment is Richardson’s  extensive cataloging of narrative situations. In many ways, this book is an homage  to literary innovations in experimental narration during the last century. His treat- ment is even-handed; he utilizes the work of many established literary figures like  Beckett, Woolf, and Conrad but not at the expense of examining the interesting  narrative techniques of lesser-known writers. His inductive approach to this project  allows the texts to guide his theoretical findings and conclusions in a way that is  both productive to his argument and helpful to the reader. Unnatural Voices is at  once easily accessible to the reader in a way that many works of narrative theory  are not, and intricately complex in its theoretical approach. </page> </plain_text>
