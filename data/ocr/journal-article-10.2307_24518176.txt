<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Chinese Funeral José Marti Translated from Spanish by Esther Allen Translator's Note The traveler to Cuba flies into José Marti International Airport, possibly to do research at the José Marti National Library or at the Institute of José Marti Studies, or to visit any of the several museums dedicated to Marti in Havana alone, not to mention the statues of him that are everywhere, in the Parque Central, the Plaza de la Revo lution, and, most recently, on a section of the waterfront Malecön fleetingly known as the "Plaza Elian," where a newly erected effigy of Marti with a young boy in his arms now points an accusing finger at the building that houses the U.S. Special Interests Section. The booksellers' stalls in the Plaza de Armas offer an extensive selection of works by and on José Marti, and not too much else. And though the currency of Cuba these days is the U.S. dollar, an attendant in a Havana museum offered to sell me an actual Cuban coin: You can guess whose picture was on it. Such omnipresence takes its toll. In Cuba, José Marti is visible to the point of invisibility, perpetually honored with such mandatory religious reverence that it becomes very hard for Cubans to do anything but pay grudging lip service to him or ignore him. Marti was deported to Spain at the age of seventeen, and went back to Havana only twice, once for less than two months, and then again for only a year. For most of his adult life (from 1880 until his death in the Cuban revolution of independence in 1895) he lived where I live, in New York City. I need hardly say that his invisibility here is of a different order: In the city that he was always away from, he is everywhere, and in the city he actually inhabited, nowhere. (Well, not nowhere. But how many New Yorkers know that a statue of José Marti stands on Central Park South, at the very top of the "Avenue of the Americas"? And then, just this fall, his photograph appeared on the sides of city buses in an advertisement that touted the "Revo lutionary Flavor" of a new lime and mint rum liqueur called "Marti Autentico.") It amazes me to remember that I once looked him up in 266</page><page sequence="2">José Marti the eleventh edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which came out sixteen years after his death, with some actual expectation of finding him there; after all, his work was published extensively throughout the Western hemisphere, from Buenos Aires to New York City, and his death was mourned across both North and South America. Fat chance. He didn't make it into the Britannica until the late 1960s. Still, his fate in the English-speaking world has at least been better than that of a magazine called La América, which he edited for a time in the mid-1880s. Its offices were located on lower Broadway, not too far from my house, but La América was so entirely without meaning to the United States of America that no library here has so much as a copy of it, and the scholar wishing to consult it must travel to Havana or Bogota. During his lifetime—ever mindful of the crucial role that U.S. pub lic opinion always played in the history of Cuba—Marti himself published a number of articles in English, the earliest ones originally and shakily written by him, the later ones translated, though the quality of those translations declined over time. (One of the last and most accusatory of these ventures into the language of the country he was living in, an exposition of the plight of the Cuban tobacco workers of Key West, which Marti had someone translate for publi cation in a bilingual pamphlet in January 1894, is almost unreadable in its English version.) A lone volume of translations of some of his poems appeared during the Spanish-American War in 1898, three years after his death. But nothing else came out in English until 1954, when, as part of the ongoing celebration of the centennial of Marti's birth in 1853, Juan de Onis did beautiful work translating an anthology titled The America of José Marti. De Onis's book held out the promise of inaugurating a real appre ciation of Marti's importance in the United States. But it was not to be. Not that other volumes of Marti's work haven't appeared in English since then; they have, almost a dozen of them, by several dif ferent translators. But all neglected a fundamental fact about trans lation: that it is the performance of an acquired skill. No one would expect the musicologist who's an expert on the life of Franz Liszt to be, therefore, the most accomplished performer of the Hungarian Rhapsodies. But in translation this happens all the time; scholarly knowledge (or even just some basic knowledge of the original lan guage) is assumed to be the only prerequisite for performance as a translator. And Marti is to Spanish what Liszt is to the piano 267</page><page sequence="3">José Marti repertoire: extremely difficult. Yet none of the translators who ap proached Marti's work had ever translated anyone else, or ever went on to translate anyone else afterward: Their interest was purely in Marti, not in translation. And while this is also true of Juan de Onis, whose translations are excellent, he was the son of the great Harriet de Onis, the preeminent U.S. translator from Spanish in the forties and fifties, who did everything from the sixteenth-century Spanish picaresque novel Lazarillo de Tonnes to Alejo Carpentier's The Lost Steps. Perhaps growing up so steeped in the importance and the rigors of translation was enough (and who knows, maybe he had some maternal assistance with his work). Not only has Marti been translated badly, but bad translation has been deliberately used to seriously distort his ideas. Like everyone who has governed Cuba since its independence in 1902, Fidel Castro invokes Marti constantly, and the Castro regime, particularly in its early days, struggled to reinvent Marti as a rabid hater of the U.S. and a closet Communist, the John the Baptist who heralded the advent of the Messiah Fidel. Philip S. Foner, editor of six volumes of Marti's work in English, uses inflammatory titles (Inside the Monster) and the surreptitious trimming of inconvenient passages to bolster this image. But what really makes those volumes so deadly to Marti's reputation is the sheer unreadability of most of the translations. To pick one example from among many, a sentence describing the area around Lake Mohonk—"Convidan a la grandeza los bosques de Adirondack cercanos que talan sin sistema especuladores torpes" ("The nearby forests of the Adirondacks are conducive to grandeur, though they are being unsystematically cut down by short-sighted speculators")—is translated in Foner's volume as, "The forests of the adjacent Adirondacks beckon to grandeur, unsystematically cutting down crude speculators." Marti had confused the Catskills with the Adirondacks, true, but not even in his wildest rhetorical transports could he have suggested that beckoning forests were capable of cut ting down crude speculators. Yet it isn't really surprising that an editor who disagreed with so much of what Marti had to say paid so little attention to the meaning of Marti's words. All of these books add up to a loss: the loss of José Marti in English. And that loss is particularly acute for the United States. For one of Marti's greatest achievements as a writer was his description of the United States in the crônicas—the "Letters from New York"—that he wrote for newspapers across Latin America during the 1880s. José Marti was one of the great foreign commentators on the United 268</page><page sequence="4">José Marti States. And his commentaries and descriptions remain unknown here, more than a century after they were written. It has therefore been my real joy to find myself, as William Carlos Wilhams put it, "in a position to make the necessary translations," and awake to my own locality. In the following ciônica, written in New York on October 19, 1888, and published in the Buenos Aires newspaper La Nation on December 16 of that year, Marti describes the funeral of a Chinaman he calls "Li-In-Du" who, like Marti himself, appears to have been a figure of international historic importance who passed through New York City like a shadow, unknown and unrecognized except by the small community of his countrymen. For a moment the furor of politics died down and New York stepped aside to make way for the colorfully garbed Chinamen who, with highest honors, filed in the Asiatic manner behind the bier of Li-In-Du, the illustrious general of the Black Flags,1 who has died in their arms. The parades of the political parties, the mobile orators on their wagons, and the varied musics of the electoral process recede into the distance now. Today there is a strange, new music, the music of Li-In-Du's funeral. Let us go with a curious New York to listen. Li-In-Du was a man of valor. He drove France out of Tonkin and used his prestige to help the friends of liberty, but even that prestige was of no use against the harassment of the authorities who do not want China to be rid of its class hierarchy. He barely escaped with his life, and was followed to San Francisco by a few loyal lieutenants. He did not wander in idleness, like the many swordsmen of our own race who think that the fact of having once been a man who defend ed the patria authorizes them to cease being a man and to live off of her instead. Liberty, too, has its scoundrels! And Li-In-Du did not want to be one of them, but instead busied himself with the trades of his land, that is, doing laundry and serving food—the two things the Chinese are allowed to do here. For if they work in mines or on railways, they are hunted down like wild beasts, chased from their 'Bands of Chinese rebels who roamed the mountains of Tonkin, in what is now north ern Vietnam, where they had been driven after the suppression of the Yunnan (1855-72) and Taiping (1850-1864) rebellions against the Manchu dynasty. 269</page><page sequence="5">José Marti shacks by gunshots and burned alive.2 In New York, Mott Street is theirs; it is the street where they have their banks, their stock market, their tailors and barbershops, their taverns and their vices. On that streeet can be found the Chinaman friar, a merry and mellifluous savant, well fleshed, with roses in his face, not much in the way of cheekbones, an avid mouth, and a shrewd and lively eye. There, too, is the shopkeeper Chinaman, with loose, spongy flesh the color of earth, his billowing shirt and wide pants rolled up, his hair short and dense, eyes bloodshot, hands meaty and long-nailed, a three-layer chin falling to his chest like an udder, and, for a mustache, two threads. There is the harsh and aloof Chinaman, the fenced-in nomad who once wielded the sword or the pen and now makes his living as an amanuensis and mediator, by turns mute or loquacious, kept in poverty by the ignorant rich man who is pleased to avenge himself thus on one whose head is fully inhabited. And there is the Chinaman of the laundries, who can sometimes be tall, youthful, naive, and gallant-faced, with agate bracelets on his wrists, but more often is an ungainly runt, meek and misshapen, without nobility in his mouth or gaze, or else a man who does not walk but drags himself along, slumped and gloomy, with two glass balls for eyes, drooling from opium. But today the opium-smokers' daises are empty, the laundries are closed, there is no entry to the houses that sell foodstuffs, and bands of mourning adorn the lanterns that hang from balconies to advertise the taverns. Mott and the surrounding streets are full of Asians, gath ered to bear their great man, Li-In-Du, to his grave; full of the Irishmen and Italians who inhabit that muddy and odiferous neigh borhood alongside them,- and full, too, of the curious from all parts of the world who throng the streets along which the procession is to pass by the thousands. The yellow man lifts up his eyes, the eyes of a hunted animal; he looks about as he walks along, as if to guard against an offense; he swears under his breath as he walks, his eyes ablaze, or he walks with his head low, as if to beg pardon for the sin of being alive. They go in groups to the house where the funeral is held, walking along two by two, in their flat black hats, their robes and pants of dark blue fabric, their hands crossed on their chests, their feet in string slippers above which their loose pants sway like 2A reference to the massacre of Chinese workers in Rock Springs, Wyoming, during which white members of the Knights of Labor brutally ransacked the Chinese section of the town, killed twenty-eight Chinese, and wounded fifteen. Marti had described those events in detail in an article published in La Naciôn on October 23, 1885. 270</page><page sequence="6">José Marti petticoats,- they enter the funeral parlor, which is a stable, today lined in black, with two strips of cloth, one black and one white, forming a cross on the ceiling; they go, two by two, to prostrate themselves before the glowing altar at the body's feet, beside two tables piled high with the goat, lambs, oranges, and flower-wreathed cakes that will be served to the friends of the deceased three days hence at the funeral banquet, which takes place in silence at the most silent hour of the night. Two by two they come, taking from the altar, with its seven lamps, the cups of oil and holy rice given out by priests who wear white tunics with sashes and skullcaps of black. And they empty the cups, two by two, into the waiting basin that stands at the foot of the coffin, next to the tub where, on a bed of fresh earth, the candles of the soul are burning. The dead man lies in his coffin, with its rich fabrics and copious silverwork, exposed from the waist up; he has the head of a solid man, eyes set deep and close to the nose, nose with wide nostrils, Hps slender and tight, the braid brought from behind to he across the forehead like a crown, and one hand lying on his breast, which is cov ered with the paper money of Asia, to pay the toll of heaven. Around him, in bronze cups, the sacred perfumes give off their smoke and the candle of the soul its thick and waxy clouds; at the head of the coffin hangs a flag showing the sins of the deceased, surrounded by white circles, which he must overcome in order to ascend to the Elysian Fields that crown them, represented by a black mark. The tables can no longer hold all the piles of fruit, baskets of nuts, plat ters of lemons, towers of funeral cake. There is no space through which those who are arriving can make their way to the altar to pros trate themselves three times in quick succession and leave the oil in the basin and some flowers on the tables. But they do not tear their hair or rend their garments, they do not bare their heads, cease their smoking, or evince any sorrow over the changed state of one who defended their land so well, beneath the great red banner. He who has done one thousand three hundred good deeds, is he not immortal in the heavens, according to the law of Tao?3 The defeat of the Frenchman was more than three hundred good deeds, which is all that is required to be like a deputy of immor tality, immortal on earth! Life is like the sides of a pitcher, which 3Literally "path." An ancient philosophical system stemming from the Tao-te-ching, a text written in the third century B.c., which instructs humans to abjure all striving. Marti's description of a peculiarly anthropomorphic Tao may be attributable to the 271</page><page sequence="7">José Marti contain the useful emptiness that is then filled up with milk, wine, honey, or perfume; but the pitcher's emptiness is more valuable than its sides, just as eternity, joyful and unbounded, is worth more than this existence, in which man cannot lead freedom to victory. To die is to return to what one was at the beginning, is it not? Death is blue, white, opalescent, it is the return to a lost delight, a journey. And so he takes along sufficient provisions! Hands buried in their loose winter shirts, they speak of how Li In-Du was an awe-inspiring general, who looked, in battle, like a winged pillar, the type of pillar the Chinaman erects to ward off demons,- of how he killed many a Frenchman, though Tao says one must not step on an insect or cut down a tree, because to do so is to destroy life; of how he was a great merchant, dealing in drugs and fabrics, teas and foodstuffs, though the law of Tao forbids the pursuit of vanity's false honors or the riches of this world. That was the old Tao, whose beard is covered with ice in the heavens now. Li-In-Du? Fifty thousand dollars. And he has a son, in China, who inherits all of it! The devils will not manage to carry him off; he has much gold in his hand to scatter when they come out to meet him along the way. And amid the smoke of incense and cigars a mourner appears dressed in blue, holding in upraised arms a stuffed pig garlanded with roses. Those in the white tunics step aside to allow an old man wearing a yellow cape lined in black, advancing with solemn steps through the masons in their gray tunics and red skullcaps, to reach the altar. Amid all the smoke, he is lost from sight and his salutation cannot be heard through the mad shrieking clamor of the music: Fom! Bang! Ba-tan-TAN! Piiii! Bon, son, son! The shattered air crackles and squeals. The old man throws himself onto the glass part of the coffin, kisses it three times, and three times lets out a terrible cry, a cry that finally imposes silence and fear. He returns to the altar, seizes a banner, and sings, in verse, of the feats of Li, and of how much the world will miss him, and of the feast that will now be held on the mountain of Tao. And others sing after him, one of them on his knees, forehead to the ground, another nature of the information he was given by former Taiping rebels. Hung Hsiu-ch'üan, the visionary leader of the Taiping (Great Peace) Rebellion, in which Li-In-Du appar ently took part, had studied Christianity for two months with an American Protestant missionary named Roberts, and believed himself to be the younger brother of Jesus Christ. He subsequently evolved a syncretistic Taoism influencd by Christian theol ogy, which even included a Taoist version of the Ten Commandments. 272</page><page sequence="8">José Marti gesticulating like a man describing a battle, while at his feet, in a goblet with two serpents for handles, blaze the prayers that the celes tial one burns, kneeling, rather than intoning them with his hps. The room is full to bursting now,- the procession is beginning to form. We'll go outside to watch it. Outside we'll be able to see all of it. Is it an army or a funeral? Over the heads of the multitude move lanterns and flags. There are white horses. Their riders are bare headed, their braids covered in black cloth and wrapped around the forehead like a diadem. The great red banner, proud and graceful, waves above it all. Aggressive people charge toward it, laughing. He looks as if he were about to die, the man who grips the flag with trembling gloves! The oriflammes and standards gather sub missively around the flagpole like new shoots around a tree trunk, red and yellow, purple and sapphire, red and violet, amaranth and pink. The crests of tire funeral coach can be glimpsed, and the black heads of its four horses. The gold paper of the insignia glitters in the sunlight, but no idol can be seen, no image of Ts'ai-Shen,4 the god of wealth, who now has more temples than any other god, in China and everywhere else; there is no image, either, of Kuan-Ti,5 the god of battles, who has vipers for eyebrows and carries a huge whip. Li-In Du does not believe in images or in any god but the pure creator Tao, who is all and one, and who engendered the two, and from the two the three, and from the three the world; he does not believe in any saint but the virtues themselves, without the dominions and hier archies by which the priests have obscured religion, nor does he believe in Great Bears, Pearly Emperors, the mother of lightning, the king of the sea, the lord of the currents, the deity that protects man's every class and occupation, or the god of thunder whose thirty-six black and gray generals come and go, bearing his orders, while with his restless feet he mortifies the plumage of nine beautiful birds. Li In-Du is a mason, a freethinker, his own man, a venerable of Chinese freemasonry, who wore the leather apron edged in green. Everywhere the world is in turmoil and man suffers to assure the freedom of his will. That was why Li-In-Du's forehead was broad and level and his cheekbones were flattened: from banging his head against the 4Still one of the most widely worshiped gods in the Chinese pantheon, whose images are sold in the street during Chinese New Year. 5 Another very popular Chinese deity, the god of battle or war, a historical Han general who died in 220 A.D. and was not deified until the sixteenth century. 273</page><page sequence="9">José Marti despotic empire! He was a Taoist of the old school, who believed in the population of the air, the rest from struggle, the everlasting indi vidual, and transfiguration and a final place on the mountain of Tao when duty has been fulfilled. But here below: liberty! And with his masonic hammer he went about softening up the Chinese emperor's head. They are touching to behold, these founding rebels. Such men rise like flames from the choking thicket. They appear as Li-In-Du did in his coffin, wearing gold and fire, in a tunic of yellow silk. Now they are coming toward us, in order. The police go first, shoulder to shoulder, clearing the way, and after them a German band, in helmets and short jackets, playing a funeral hymn. The generals follow, the three generals who took part in the victory at Nanking.6 They parade on white horses, riding like men more apt to charge headlong at the enemy than turn tail and run; their bodies are stringy and of medium height, and there is more muscle than dough in their faces,- their bare helmets are encircled with a band of red linen, a black diadem on the front; they wear blue tunics, breeches, and loose pants with a white sash at the waist in sign of mourning; their horses are well in check and move with high, slow steps. Tall flags jammed into sockets on their belts, three young Chinamen in mauve shirts and trousers pass by,- on those flags are inscribed the glorious deeds of the departed, the nausea with which he left San Francisco where he saw the Chinaman contented with his base con dition, the agony of his final days, when death was approaching on foot, like one who respects his victim, but the Congress in Wash ington, for internal political reasons, passed a law to deport the celes tial one, and death no longer came slowly, considerately, but galloped in on a horse and killed him with the news, ay! Li-In-Du, one of the men who devote their lives to seeing their people freed and their fellow citizens honorable! Then, shaped like a heart wreathed in flowers, came the yellow standard of Lun-Gee-Tong, the masonic lodge he presided over, along with its members, wearing blue tunics and skullcaps of black silk; the priests in white tunics came behind with measured footsteps, surrounding the old man in the cloak lined in black. A low noise like a muffled clucking greets those who go by next, also wearing loose shirts, with knee breeches and puttees and wide 6The conquest of Nanking in 1853 was the great victory of the Taiping Rebellion, one of the most massive upheavals of the nineteenth century, which brought death to twenty to thirty million people. 274</page><page sequence="10">José Maiti white sashes at the waist and around the forehead: These are the twenty-five loyal soldiers who have followed Li-In-Du everywhere, and they seem taller than they really are as they move forward, proud and taut, a forest of banners over their heads, each a different color, and looming over them all a round canopy of mandarin orange and purple. Behind two white lanterns, wearing tunics of various colors, with sashes around their chests and bows at their elbows and along then sides, come men who bear, on red poles, the eight pure insignia/ cut out of cardboard and decorated with gold and flowers: the command ments of the law of Tao that Tao himself gave to the chieftan Gwin Li-Du on the bright mountain of Tien-San; the holy fruit that Tao ate on the mountain before his transfiguration; the sword with which Gwin defended the divine law; the celestial ax that falls wrathfully upon the world when evil prevails; the flute of peace; the lively wooyin with which the spirits of the redeemed accompany their hap piness; the tea-scented celestial flowers that neither dry nor wither, and the white urn of life eternal. And behind them, just ahead of the coffin, comes a white horse led by a groom, with no rider in its bronze-trimmed leather saddle. Then comes the coach, and a beggar in an ash-colored tunic sits in the coachman's seat, dropping imperial paper money on the multitude at intervals so that the dead man's way will be clear. Then comes the mourner, the nephew Li-Yung, in a white cloak and black sash, his head bare. Then, in two black and yellow car riages, the Chinese musicians, their tones shrill and discordant, with out notes or phrases, sounding more of triumph and joy than of mourning. And then the retinue of Chinese freemasons, in great coats and fur hats, with the leather apron bearing the three letters, and then a thousand Chinamen more, two by two, arms crossed. And this colorful swarm of people and the four white horses and the banners and the insignia of Tao gather in the cemetery around the grave, where they are jostled, with laughter and cruel joking, by thousands of the curious: ruffianly idlers, sweethearts in the bloom of life, new mothers, fur-clad ladies, odiferous Irishwomen. Instead of leaves, the trees are bedecked in urchins. On the decrepit roof of a 7Here again, the anthropomorphic Tao that Marti describes is extremely anomalous. The insignia he saw probably referred to the life of one of the countless Taoist deities, though it is not clear which. Eight is one of the most auspicious numbers in Chinese religion, and Taoism has its Eight Immortals, but only three of them coincide with these eight insignia: the flute, the sword, and the flowers. 275</page><page sequence="11">José Marti rambling nearby house, a group of actresses are peeling oranges. Suddenly the crowd draws back; the banners fall to the ground, tunics and sashes fly through the air, and a wave of churning smoke rises from the sudden bonfire where all the garments and emblems from the funeral are being immolated, the cloaks and tunics, the black fabric that wrapped the braids, the mourning draperies of the horses, the oriflammes and pennants, the insignia of Tao, the great red banner, and the dead man's trunk. As the crowd disperses, craning their necks, they can see the grave, arranged in the celestial manner. At the head, as a support, is the masonic heart, its pole plunged into the earth; then come the two white lanterns, also stuck into the ground, and along the body to the feet are white and yellow roses arranged in the shapes of urns and cushions; at the feet and to each side are the seven mystic candles, and near them are cups of rice, plates of cabbage, rolls, heaps of wine drenched earth, cakes, buns, and two roast chickens: the banquet that the friends of Li-In-Du, on their haunches, have spread out to keep him from suffering the pangs of hunger during his difficult jour ney to the mansion of the spirits, where he will be a fortunate and immortal djinn, watching closely over those he loved in life, a pure spirit, interceding on behalf of mankind and the freedom of China, and assisting his friends and relatives with gifts and miracles. 276</page></plain_text>
