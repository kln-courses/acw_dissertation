<plain_text><page sequence="1">Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagnation Anastasia Kayiatos On December 28, 1972, the speechless pantomime Enchanted Island debuted at the deaf Theater of Mimicry and Gesture in Moscow. Directed by the gay actor and author Evgenii Kharitonov (1941-1981) and staged a total of sixty-six times before its closing night on March 31, 1980, the play has never been performed anywhere else or ever again. In the loose terms of its plot, Enchanted Island floats "philosophically" (Nadezhda Ivankovs kaia, personal interview, May 27, 2010) between Ovid's Metamorphosis and Shakespeare's Tempest (whose eighteenth-century adaptation shares a title with the Soviet play). It is broken up into three acts, in which a jeal ous Prosperian sorcerer magically shape-shifts a pair of shipwrecked lovers into all manners of being; all the while the lovers remain resolute in their insatiable search for one another's touch. Some of the fantastic aspects assumed by the actors include a touching trio of palm trees; an invisible man and a married couple; a military commander, his cross-dressed maid, and a lovelorn cavalryman; and a cave-dwelling Cyclops, his companion monkey, and their marooned human captive. The spectacle was strange by late-Soviet standards and was met with mixed reviews, if the theater guestbook and the actors' recollections are a good indication among the scant archival traces. Many audience mem bers punningly applauded the play's ability to enchant, as in the following typical if uninspired inscription by a boarding school collective in March 1973: "Thank you for the enchanting play of the actors, the marvelous plasticity, the bewitchment." Others bristled at the brazenness of nearly naked bodies moving in such unexpected ways and to no apparent end.

Another entry in the same vein reads, "Twelve of us came to watch your pantomime, eight left during the intermission. What is it? What's it about? What's the use? The actors exhibit movement with their bodies very well, but what's the use, what's it about? To whom are you addressing such a spectacle? Maybe this sort of thing is fashionable in Moscow but no one where I'm from would like it. I consider this show harmful and the evening lost. With indignation, Orlov, Trainer [and] Severskii, Economist." In this essay, I take up the gauntlet thrown down by the scandalized babushka, physical trainer, and socialist economist to answer their com mon indignant query: What's the use of Enchanted Island and, extrapo lating, what's the use of enchantment? I ask after the inexplicable link between enchantment and plasticity that Orlov and Severskii sense but cannot name. This last query is provoked as much by the play as it is by Max Weber's famous pronouncement in 1918 that "the increasing intellec tualization and rationalization" of the West, and the growth of the modern state, had induced the "disenchantment of the world," with the more inti mate side-effect of "disenchant[ing] and denuding man's bearing of its] mystical but inwardly genuine plasticity" ([1918] 1954,139,155). Weber's words prove pertinent to the present analysis not least of all as they anticipate the operative terms of the Soviet pantomime, but also, on a metatextual level, because they continue to define the terms of debate about modernity's disenchantment to this day, and, most important, because the enchanted event I offer for consideration now transpired in a culture so supremely '"scientifized,"' it might be said to bring Weber's bleak forecast to its fullest fruition. I am referring to the epoch of Soviet history retroactively known as "stagnation," which corresponds to Leonid Brezhnev's conservative tenure as Communist Party secretary from 1965 1985. This was a time of utter disillusionment with communism's Utopian dream, cold war historians concur, when the arteries of the Soviet state had gelled into an immoveable gerontocracy, making inward plasticity of the personal and social orders unthinkable. Of course, "the moment we think of the world as disenchanted," Dipesh Chakrabarty warns, "we set limits to the ways the past can be narrated" (2000,89). That contemporary scholars of socialism still cling to a dismal picture of those days self-fulfills the prophecy of our own historical moment. On account of its deliberate disenchanting during and after the cold war, stagnation is lost on us today</page><page sequence="4">108 Anastasia Kayiatos as little more than totalitarian "nothingness" (Bren 2010, 6), the faint gasp of a failed alternative to the triumphant capitalist modernity in which we now all live. Instrumentalizing the status of Kharitonov's play as silent and lost, of a piece with a political period for which scholars are similarly at a loss to describe, this essay breaks the usual totalitarian silence surrounding stag nation. It conjures up a counternarrative oflate-Soviet enchantment—not to the exclusion of bureaucracy but because of it, not in sync with the party-state's ideal but with an unlikely dreamworld forged for a flickering instant by socialism's silent others: the queer and the deaf, the unspeak able and the unspeaking, respectively. As I try to capture their strangely enchanted tale, I am quickly tripped up by the aporia at the heart of alterist historiography, as predicted by Weber and Chakrabarty. If, as they allege, disenchantment is itself an effect of academic thinking, which in turn sets the limits on scholarly description, how can we possibly "render this enchanted world into our disenchanted prose" (Chakrabarty 2008, 77)? What then is the relationship between disenchantment and silence? And how can we narrate the enchantment of the past when it appears to us only as silence in the present? To retrieve the misplaced plasticity of Soviet modernity, I turn self consciously to Soviet "plastic culture" itself, the silent performance style in which Enchanted Island was staged. Introducing Weber's original idea into the play's distinctly socialist context, my analysis stretches plastic ity to encompass four primary concepts, which I elaborate in the essay's following sections. The first of these addresses plasticity as a property of late-Soviet society, which was characterized by the dynamic interac tion of politically nimble citizens with a functionally pliable bureaucratic state. The second section homes in on the inward plasticity of the social ist subject as honed in the physical discipline of plasticity, a revolution ary method of moving the body meaningfully in silence, to which, I argue, marginalized Soviet actors were uniquely inclined. Between its inward and outward, individual and communal manifestations, plasticity produces feelings of enchantment, which the next section apprehends on and off the stage of Enchanted Island. At the conclusion of the essay, I propose plastic ity as a fairy tale approach to history, one that pries open the disenchanted past to palpate expressions of political possibility and even Utopian dream ing when and where they seem least imaginable. As I narrate a history of plasticity, which is by definition a history of</page><page sequence="5">Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagnation 109 silence, I take up the tactics of queer historiographers, whose elusive sub jects closely resemble the actors in this essay. Like Carolyn Dinshaw, I sketch out a "history that is not straight," which "requires the rewiring of the senses" to apprehend fully (Dinshaw et al. 2007, 185). Her tricks for doing time queerly figure into the following pages, wherein the canonical body of history is bent; the sensible priorities of "straight" scholarship are reshuffled; we reinvest ourselves in the magical present of the past and, so doing, hopefully reinhabit the staggering political depression of stagna tion—the structure of feeling that suffused the time and place I consider and, in different ways, the time and place in which my considering occurs. An awareness of the past s multiplicity enables us "to begin to imagine col lective possibilities for a post-disenchanted—that is to say, queer—future" (Dinshaw 2007,122). This, I argue, is precisely what Enchanted Island did in its day. Quiet Counterpublics: The Inward Plasticity of Late-Soviet Society Just as the plastic actors of Enchanted Island envisioned and embodied other worlds, I am tasked with imagining the world of the play itself, since no reviews or recordings of the production exist despite its eight-year run, the otherwise reliable cataloging of the deaf theaters repertoire, and the more or less persistent presence of nondeaf pantomime in theater journals of the time. To compensate for this telling lacuna in cultural memory, a big part of my project is descriptive: I construct my argument by reconstruct ing Enchanted Island piece by piece, from the play's post factum libretto, the doctoral dissertation on pantomime Kharitonov defended in 1972, and the interviews I conducted with those deaf actors who were still alive in 2009 and 2010 (who supplied me with the images I include here)—though these interviews are partial, too. Suffering a loss in translation between spoken and signed Russian, more properly manual than oral history, they cannot account for a certain bodily surplus so essential to the event. An awareness of this inarticulable excess actually assists scholars who strive "to get back to the repressed speech" of the silent sorcerer, in whose apposite person Michel de Certeau embodies historical alterity (1988, 251). To escape the paradox of "speak[ing] about a so-called ineffable experience which therefore cannot be spoken about" he recommends read ing for "the 'other' traces" the sorcerer embeds in the "normalizing" dis courses that mediate his speech through a "succession of silences ... still</page><page sequence="6">110 Anastasia Kayiatos marked by what they have eliminated, in order to be established as [the norm]" (251). The babushka is a good place for us to start, then, as her grumblings give away Enchanted Island's more obvious departures from the dominant cultural script: the near-naked actors, the apparent point lessness of a production more concerned with bodily plasticity than with politically edifying plot. At the same time, she lets slip her thwarted expec tations for an evening at the Theater of Mimicry and Gesture, the first pro fessional theater of the deaf in the world, wherein vocal speech—not sign language or silence—was the norm. The theater was famous for doing the classics of the "conversational" canon, such as Shakespeare and Schiller, in its trademark ventriloquist style: deaf actors onstage lip-synched to voices supplied by emcees, often audiologists by profession, who sat inconspicu ously in the front row of the house. When this was done successfully, the consummate effect resembled a dubbed film. The ventriloquist style dis persed the oralist efforts of the defectology class (the Soviet equivalent of special education), which presumed deaf students to be mute and taught them to speak intelligibly and read lips. Thus forbidden from being silent, the Soviet deaf were subject to what I have elsewhere called "compulsory vocality": an institutional imperative to demonstrate the ways in which the state imparted its silent citizens with the vocal language that would integrate them into the speaking collective (Kayiatos 2010). Compulsory vocality constrained the theater s archive as well, wherein "talkie" plays were preserved more rigorously than the few silent pantomimes that sur vive in personal if not institutional memory. Enchanted Island was the rara avis in a mostly verbal repertoire, and its refusal of speech alienated view ers who needed the meaning of the play spelled out for them in words that could literally be heard, who happened on the pantomime "accidentally" (Ritta Zhelezova and Tat'iana Kovalskaia, personal interviews, May 26 and 31, 2010), hoping to see the deaf speak as a feat of socialist progress but at a loss when they encountered an entirely different scene. The same ambiguity of silence that appalled the babushka and the body trainer s party of twelve attracted another set of theatergoers. Cutting across social lines of age, profession, and aural ability, the play appealed to those with avant-garde sensibilities, since "not everyone [was] able to understand [Kharitonov]." Such a privilege fell only to "the chosen" few, in the appraisal of one actress (Nadezhda Ivankovskaia, personal interview, May 27,2010)—an elite cluster of counterpublics, whose eccentric mem bers converged on the occasion of the gay director's collaboration with the</page><page sequence="7">Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagnation 111 deaf troupe. Along with the deaf community and its allies, the play s audi ence comprised the unofficial intelligentsia; the capital's self-proclaimed apolitical counterculture or '"beau monde': aristocratic society, [mostly] hippies, artists, people of the artistic underground" (Tat'iana Koval'skaia and Tat'iana Petukhova, personal interviews, June 6 and 8, 2010); and the stealth homosexual subculture, with which Kharitonov aligned himself in his own underground writing. Their strange commingling was made pos sible by pantomime s cultivation of vnye, a concept coined by anthropolo gist Alexei Yurchak, denoting a social space peculiar to late socialism that fits neatly neither in nor outside officialdom but instead enjoys an ambiva lent situation of support from and slight subversion of the state. In such "deterritorialized milieus," the socialist subject "[was] not tuned into a certain semantic field of meaning [... and replaced] Soviet political and social concerns with a quite different set of concerns that allowed one to lead a creative and imaginative life" (Yurchak 2006, 132). Going over and against the states expressed purposes for official space, deterritorialized milieus showed off the inward plasticity of a system that was supposed to be unbending. The performing arts were generally vnye at this time, and the internally slack regulation of the deaf theater in particular allowed for the efflo rescence of its experimentalism. This was a point of attraction for unaf filiated directors like Kharitonov, who also drew on the techniques of silent expression from Aesopian drama and the unsanctioned eroticism of Russian ballet after Rudolf Nureyev in order to smuggle in non-party minded meaning. Fittingly, in this socially flexible setting, Kharitonov practiced a style of pantomime called "plasticity," or the "plastic culture of the actor," which he had inherited from the modernist era by way of his undergraduate mentor, Aleksandr Rumnev (1899-1965). In the 1920s, Rumnev was at the helm of "a new generation of choreograph [ers]" who intended their ecstatic celebration of the male physique to be erotic and even homoerotic. Although this subtext remained tacit, Rumnev s style of movement became too risky to remain a public spectacle in the Stalin ist era (Misler 2000), with the rising rhetoric against sexual deviance and the introduction of an antisodomy statute in 1933 that criminalized the "abnormal use' of the male body" by effeminate homosexuals (Healey 2002, 166). The public policing of private sexual activity at this time was predicated on the legibility of an emergent gay body, its self-revelation through a repertoire of gender-transgressing gestures, which were readily</page><page sequence="8">112 Anastasia Kayiatos on display at the modernist theater; silence simultaneously disappeared and sustained performances of sexual alterity throughout socialism. As expressions of sexual difference in a homophobic society depend on the possibility of their invisibility forensic effacement, or semantic slipperi ness (Munoz 2001), suggestive gesture is really the only residue of queer ness there is to read off the official record. This would be a tall order for historians of Soviet alterity save that Kharitonov hands us a pass: his dis sertation on plasticity and pantomime libretti catalog a corporeal idiom whose self-conscious departures from the dominant code of comport ment secrete clues of queer presence. By reinvigorating Rumnev s plastic gestures, Kharitonov reactivated modernism's revolutionary gender and sexual imaginaries and enabled a queer form of spectatorship that granted its male viewers temporary per mission from pantomime as an "enchanting" and "sensual art" to appre ciate the beauty of other male bodies ("Chto takoe pantomima?" 2007). The "shamefully naked" cast of Enchanted Island went further than their strictly male predecessors by so blurring gender boundaries that the lines of erotic looking that their bare bodies encouraged may have confused and even queerly crossed the eyes of the audience. The coed actors heightened this heady effect by donning identical cherubic wigs and matching fish net body stockings, which the resident wardrobe director stitched directly onto their bodies before each show. She improvised these outfits out of avos'ki, formless shopping bags that babushkas stashed in their pockets should a queue for deficit goods suddenly crop up. Decidedly Soviet in their fabrication from scarcity, but more than likely conceived with fin-de siècle excess in mind, these costumes were shot through with stagnations mythic investment in prerevolutionary modernism as a period that pulsed with precisely the sexual possibility that contemporary society lacked. The nostalgic practice of plastic pantomime was thus able to quietly accommodate articulations of love and eros that other areas of socialist culture could not. Its persistence also meant that, though homosexuality was silenced as such, sexual alterity was never wholly inexpressible, even in the Soviet Union's highly regulated economy of signs. This situation comes most vividly to life in the public theater wherein Kharitonov artfully staged a sexual public: female prostitutes in a "public house" of ill repute, whose presence is known to us only from the actors' ephemeral (re) collec tions. The subversive potential these ladies represent subsists in any pub lic representation of sex, following Lauren Berlant and Michael Warner,</page><page sequence="9">Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagnation 113 inasmuch as "intimate life is the endlessly cited elsewhere of political pub lic discourse" (Berlant and Warner 1998, 553). Euphemizing or excising sex from public discourse consolidates the hegemony of the heteronor mative and frustrates the formation of "nonnormative or explicit public sexual cultures" (553). By going public, as it did in Moscow's theater of the deaf, "sex opens a wedge to the transformation of those social norms that require only its static intelligibility" or invisibility as straightforward heterosexuality (565). Sex publics and sex in public build new worlds out of the present one that "bear no necessary relation" to conventional social ity and "support forms of affective, erotic, and personal living that are pub lic in the sense of accessible, available to memory, and sustained through collective activity" (562). Such spectacular forms of alternative intimacy, like the ones invigorated by Enchanted Island's "public" women, point out "paths through publicity [that lead] to the production of nonheteronor mative bodily contexts (565) in the future, while giving their audiences a peek into those places where alternatives are already being acted out. Invisible Intimacies: The Outward Plasticity of Late-Soviet Selves In front of an audience aware of its own flights from normative society, Enchanted Island reveled in the forms of alterity it found by defamiliariz ing social and bodily norms. Its inceptive conceit of transubstantiation is motivated by the sorcerer s " [curiosity] to see beings created differently than he" (Kharitonov 2005, 377). And in a complementary move, the palm trees of the first act rejoice at their first encounter, interlace their leaves, and pull close in imitation of the human dancers in the cabaret where they are potted, since "neither [had] ever seen another of [its] kind" (379). Here and elsewhere, the play plays with mimicry and mimesis, as its characters confront the limits of emulation and embrace their similarity in difference. Supernatural beings become human; humans try on contradic tory identities, crossing lines of gender, age, social class, and so on. In and out of turn, they morph into inanimate objects, plants, then animals and back again. With an emphasis on the constancy of feeling in the face of physical nonidentity, the play implies that there is neither an ideal style of body nor any necessary connection between embodiment and emotional ties. Lonely personalities like the palms come together in love to claim positive space in the play's visual field by forcing themselves into public view and defiantly finding beauty in their images.</page><page sequence="10">114 Anastasia Kayiatos This message is most potent in the pantomime with the "invisible man ," who languishes in solitude on a crowded street because he is silent, so no one can hear him, and invisible, so "no one can see him or know about his life" (380). Avoiding the kicks of callous passers-by, the invisible man retreats inside the home of a married couple, who primp before the mirror as he enters. They step away, and the invisible man gingerly approaches in their stead, expecting to see his own reflection, but "dolefully draws away" when he does not (380). A series of slapstick plot twists ensues, by the end of which the invisible man, covered head to toe in paint, places himself once more before the mirror, this time to scrutinize his own image "with awe" and "great happiness" (382). The woman after whom he chases in most other scenes flies away in her airplane-body, leaving him to lovingly contemplate his own self and body while the heterosexual subplot goes unconsummated. At its conclusion, this scene offers a position of spec tatorship for audience members who see their own experience of social invisibility reflected on stage; who can enjoy the fantastic reversal of soci ety's castigating gaze; and for whom the looking glass has been an histori cally fraught locus, as with the deaf actors, whose childhood mirror images would have been constantly accompanied by the defectologist mouthing perfect vocal speech for imitation by the "mute" patient-pupil. This subversive effect is not incidental but central, for Kharitonov places what he calls the "plastic I"—a silent other to the "speaking I"— at the heart of the pantomime theory he develops in his dissertation, defended the same year in which Enchanted Island debuted. His thinking shares a curious genealogy with the position on plasticity put forth by the early Soviet state. For reasons of obvious political utility, revolutionary sci entists insisted that human nature could be made to fit the single mold of Marxist history endorsed by the party—a hypothesis whose proving pro vided the basis for the entire "Soviet pedagogical establishment" thereafter (Oushakine 2004,411). On the bent backs of society's "moral defectives," that is, those "who might not otherwise be seen as hopeful material for the fulfillment of the social-educational ideal" (Makarenko [1935] 1951, 51), these experiments gave shape to socialism by shaping what the social ist body could and could not do. The state physically drilled the plastic ity out of its defectives, as their newly "proper military bearing" attested. No longer "slouching against the table or wall," the modeled socialist man "[held] himself erect with ease and freedom, without feeling the need of props of any sort" (343-44). When a subject stayed plastic, it flailed and</page><page sequence="11">Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagnation 115 FIG. 3: Deaf children logged countless hours before the mirror with defectologists, who trained them in the oralist techniques of vocalization, facial mimicry and gesticulation. Reprinted from Zhizn'glukhikh [Deaf Life] 1 (1965) with permission. failed to step in time with the forward march of Marxist progress. Plastic ity was only an asset to the party's Pygmalion tale so long as it congealed into historical inevitability at some point, after which time all traces of personal suppleness and social disorientation had to get lost. Indeed, "the active silencing of the past and a learned 'forgetting' were necessary for the production of [the] new [Soviet] identity" (Oushakine 2004, 413-14), whose form was only fixed for the communist future by locking out the many other positions promised by man's inwardly genuine plasticity. With these experiments the state aimed to use the subjective body's inherent "ability to orient [it] self" in a "rationally organized and effective" collective body in which "everything ... assumes the form of discipline":</page><page sequence="12">116 Anastasia Kayiatos "[its] face..., its voice, its beauty, its mobility, its conviction" (Makarenko [1938] 1953,245-46,255). But not all bodies could line up with the party line, nor did they all want to. By his own admission, Kharitonov became an unpublishably queer writer because "a life of standing up straight and phys ical culture would not have worked out" for him (Kharitonov 2005,295). This personal detail partly explains the striking ontological distinction he draws in his dissertation between plasticity and speech (rather than the readier binaries of speech and muteness, or plasticity and rigidity). Given the association of plasticity with historical exclusion, it makes sense that the plastic "I" Kharitonov contours against a culturally dominant speak ing self has neither words nor verbally referent gestures at its disposal, and so communicates through "the immediate language of physical feelings or sensations," best expressed by "losing equilibrium in the physical and emotional sense" (441). By favoring ineffable experience over intelligible speech, Kharitonov privileges personalities and socialities considered in late socialism to be unspeakable (like homosexuality) or unspeaking (like deafness). His political reprioritization of silence cuts out apertures in the unsaid for Utopian hope beyond what he calls the "speaking world." It also allows for so-called defectives to subtly dissent from Soviet models of citi zenship contained in the normative rhetorical body, out of which was sup posed to emanate the collective voice of state ideology. Kharitonov s normative self may need no support to stand tall, but it must still rely on speech to do the work of discrete self-expression that the plastic self performs through its socially unconstrained range of motion. The former s movements are reduced to ritualized gesture, residing in pub lic space with the maximum efficiency afforded by standing up straight and not touching other bodies. But this "aesthetic norm of symmetry" is not natural, Kharitonov contends: it visually symbolizes the subject's success ful internalization of social norms, as indeed the Soviet state intended. By establishing an embodied "relationship between the normative and the ver tical axis," these norms act as "straightening devices," to borrow a term from Sara Ahmed's 2006 book, Queer Phenomenology (66), whose main points Kharitonov mostly anticipates. Ahmed defines "the vertical axis [as] itself an effect of being 'in line,'" "when the line taken by the body corresponds with other lines," like the party line here, "that are already given" (66). For Kharitonov, the state ideal of "total symmetry [is] the most abstracted, nonsensual ('cold') kind of order—static equilibrium," which alienates the speaking "I" from feeling its own and other bodies and frus</page><page sequence="13">Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagnation 117 trates the fulfillment of sensual desires broadly speaking (Kharitonov 2005,465). The symmetrical imperative behind "the majority of everyday situations does not permit the body to realize itself in relation to its own affects," Kharitonov reasons, because the body is not uniformly straight in its orientation; it "inclines by nature to dynamic contraposition," asym metry, slouch, and slant (463,461). In symbolically perfect posture, both Ahmed and Kharitonov locate a compulsory straightness that is related to and has spatial implications for what Adrienne Rich has called com pulsory heterosexuality. Straightness, says Ahmed, "[restricts] the capacity for other kinds of action" and feeling that depart from social norms, while "making any moment in which phenomenal space does not 'line up' seem rather queer" (2006, 91). Pantomime, on the other hand, makes room for the body to move through space at an angle and angle toward other bod ies in directions not dictated by cultural or political custom. It opens up the plastic "I" to new sensations that make it "affective," per Kharitonov, receptive to its surroundings and other bodies in novel and unnamable ways. After Ahmed, we might call these angles queer, and coin a related term by which to reconceive pantomime as an unstraightening device for late-socialist society. When allowed to collapse into its unconditioned contrapposto, and rely on props and people outside of itself for support, every body is avail able for pleasure. Such is plasticity's appeal: "this means of play interests us as containing the most profound possibility for pleasure, catharsis, for actor and audience" (Kharitonov 2005, 477). The pleasure in plastic ity multiplies not merely because the subject reemplots its body in social space, but because Kharitonov s method fundamentally challenges the coordinates by which that normative mapping takes place. Whereas the speaking subject senses itself only through the "multiple mediations of reason," including language, the plastic "I" exists in "the kind of [silent] performance that generally excludes the possibility of speech" and there fore "has a heightened sensation of itself as a body, and experience only of bodily interaction with other bodies and objects" (474). In its focus on space over speech, Kharitonov's theory complements recent strands of deaf studies that underline the unique experience of space for subjects with spatial languages, such as sign. Kanta Kochhar-Lindgren, for one, pro poses that deafness "promotes a phenomenology of speaking from other spaces of the body" as "vibrant transmitters of meaning, nodes of sensory and perceptual quotation of a fully material way of being in the world,"</page><page sequence="14">118 Anastasia Kayiatos which asks the audience to "hear [with the third ear in] the absence of apparent meaning" (2006, 15; 17). Carrie Sandahl similarly urges us to "consider how certain disability conditions alter human relationships to space," and how "disabled bodies also challenge certain aesthetic values of space, namely symmetry" (2002,27-28). The combined wisdom of these queer-crip scholars, Kharitonov included, complicates our understanding of the way straightening devices compel not only heterosexuality but also able-bodiedness and even vocality, insofar as resonant speech extends the body in space in particular but noninevitable ways. Moved Together: Plastic Consciousness and Queer Communitas Since performance space and performer's body are continuous in their plasticity, it follows that "moving one's body in space can carry one away [for the same reason]" that moving one's body through styles of being can "enchant." According to Jane Bennett, "metamorphing creatures enact the very possibility of change," and bring good feelings into focus phenom enologically, by "twist[ing] and tweak[ing] bodily habits" (2001, 17, 25). Likening the pleasure of "bodily freedom" offered by "free movements" to a "[child] jumping like a kangaroo," Bennett uncannily calls up the kanga roo-woman of Kharitonov's play, who nimbly jumps onstage at the end of act 1 to nibble up the last living stalk of the lovelorn palm lying prone on the ground. Although the tree wilts of a broken heart by the end of this scene, her soul transmigrates into another vessel by the start of the next. The very ability of metamorphosis "to extend the limits of one's current embodiment [... and] expand the horizon of the conceivable" (19) lends Kharitonov s island its peculiar charm. No form can be taken on its face, and no single morphological imaginary holds sway over the island's sway ing bodies. The play reveals self-identity to be a fiction necessary for the speaking world but superfluous for plasticity. The island's formal freedom, marked not by the absence of forms but by their playful instability, yields a kind of "nonconceptual awareness" (Kala maras 1994) conditioned by silent practice, specific to the gestural and inherently nonidentitarian. This "mythical anthropomorphic conscious ness of pantomime," as Kharitonov names it, "differ [s] in principle" from the "novelistic consciousness" of the "speaking T" (478). Put otherwise, plasticity's special ontology bears not only on the subjective experience of the actor's body but also on the ostensibly objective order of events in</page><page sequence="15">Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagnation 119 which the plastic body acts. Subjects not formed through the symbolic lack the capacity to act chronologically and are loosed from the causal chains of conversational drama wherein the speaking "I" is most at home. Instead, the pantomimic stage hosts a rearrangeable "chain of physical occur rences" which illustrate "the plasticity of the course of events itself" (476). If Kharitonov s play has a plot, it consists of the sorcerer s transubstan tiations of the lovers, which inaugurate a mythical moment inassimilable to the narrative time that encircles the island. This includes the story out side the pantomime: the heterosexual lovers' tale, the events before they wash ashore and after they are "saved." Otherwise straightness as bodily orientation or social relation has no role in enchantment and is banished by the sorcerer from his domain. Similarly, the transformations this magi cal other effects in the lovers elude our expectations; they are not lasting, cumulative, or complete. And this is how Kharitonov s relatively plotless play as an expression of the overall improvisational quality of his plasticity poses a subtle affront to the superteleological sensibilities of Soviet doxa and the forgone conclusion of communist Utopia: in place of progress, we get endless progression; instead of telos, dispersed potentiality; in lieu of unilinear futurity, he and the charmed cast give us inextricably thick presence. With neither the shape of individual bodies nor the shape of things to come predestined, the actors of the plastic stage became subjects-in process, along with the spectators, who, upon entering the theater space, submitted to the spell of a performance that resisted verbal translation, much like the deaf theater of the third ear. As my brief but appropriately unsatisfying summary of the play attests, the plot and its personae are so obscure as to be impractical for the audience to accurately guess at, ren dering it functionally abstract. To wit, as a director, Kharitonov did not explain the plot of his play in its episodic or holistic structure to the deaf actors themselves during rehearsal or the run of the show; instead, fol lowing a special plastic warm-up exercise, he asked them to improvise movement on emotional cues. As one actress reminisced, "There were no scripts, no lines, only plastic movement" (Nadezhda Ivankovskaia, per sonal interview, May 27, 2010). The transmission of a message on the literal level was thus not the purpose of the performance. Indeed, its spell would have been broken by a viewer s attempting to decode the actors' apparently nonindexical if actually multivalent metamorphoses. (In one illustrative instance, a maid</page><page sequence="16">120 Anastasia Kayiatos pretends to be the bird in a cuckoo clock who pretends to be a military commander who pretends to be inebriated, and so on). Rather, the play aimed at transmitting the affect embedded in the actors' movement to the audience, thereby activating the collective fantasy and capacity for co feeling of those who assembled into the ad hoc counterpublic of queer deaf pantomime. The deautomatized movements of the actors' bodies focused the auditorium's energy on immanent experience to restore a deeper sense of the world, a fleeting condition that performance scholar Erica Fischer-Lichte (2008) calls enchantment and Jill Dolan describes as the Utopia in performance for its transport of an audience out of the fixity of the everyday and into "the no-place we can reach only through feeling, together" and glimpse only "before the security of articulation" (Dolan 2008, 153). Dolans Utopian performative, like Kharitonov's play, lets the actors "try on other ways to be human," "unhing[ing] politics and feeling from obviousness to engage the audience imaginatively with what might be" (100). Enchanted Island aspired to this sense of connectedness by entranc ing its audience in the mythic consciousness of a "magical" communitas in which "audiences or participants feel themselves become part of a whole in an organic, nearly spiritual way" (ll). Uniting actors and audience in a consummate but nontotalitarian universe, inwardly and outwardly plas tic, the play actualized a moment of "intersubjective illumination" (Turner 1982, 48). It pushed back to the surface of modern social life the "pul sating [something]" that Weber palpated before the dawn of disenchant ment, then "[sweeping] through the great communities like a firebrand, welding them together" (Weber [1918] 1954, 155). For Rita Felski, this throbbing receptivity to the other is the erotic mark of enchantment, "a phenomenology of immersion" wherein witnesses to an aesthetic event "[feel] fully subsumed within an imagined world" and let themselves be "sucked in, swept up, [and] spirited away" by a present made "voluptuous" in its "sensuous and somatic" plenitude (Felski 2008 53,76). The enchanting excess to which these scholars all gesture seems to be a property of silent gesture itself. According to Carrie Noland, the gesturing body—and not the speaking one—goes beyond its own "communicative or instrumental" intentions to generate sensations "not-yet-marked, not yet-meaningful," that enable social "experimentation [and] subversion" (2009,195). It stands to reason that Utopian movement would not attempt to match or mime dominant cultural meanings but instead curve beyond</page><page sequence="17">Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagnation 121 them toward a horizon of "new movements, new meanings" (Noland 2009, 17). In these new movements, "it is possible to detect impulses that are not yet organized as movements," "historical moment [s] that [are] not yet fully articulated" (Love 2007, 12), rooted not in identity but in dynamic relation among society's slouching outcasts and moral defectives. This is what Robert McRuer, following Roderick Ferguson, advocates as the ges tural politics of crip theory, a critical stance between queer and disability studies that this essay sympathetically strikes. Whereas identity politics "centers on a model or representative identity... to be emulated," "a ges tural politics is always focused on social relations in all their contradiction, complexity, and most importantly, intersectionality" (McRuer 2010). Queer-crip practitioners of gestural politics—as I take the enchanted islanders supremely to be—"point away from themselves and [toward ... ] the eroticized heterogeneity of the social" (Ferguson 2003, 143). Crook ing their backs into critiques of the present, they point out its flaws with real fingers and beckon a new world into being. What's the Use of Enchantment? Fairy Tales of Other Futures Rituals of reenchantment like Enchanted Island performed a vital function for Soviet actors during stagnation, as the disparity between the political Utopia achieved in party rhetoric and the lived realities of actually existing socialism widened undeniably. The play premiered but four years after the tanks rolled into Prague and over Utopia a final time. At this point, per Jiir gen Habermas, "every glimmer of hope for the future had vanished" ( 1994, 124) and Soviet society—not to speak of the international Left—entered a period of widespread political disenchantment that saturated everyday life with a heavy mood of hopelessness. If Khrushchev's optimistic 1960s had "[spoken] in words [that] could be heard," then the stagnant 1970s "took a turn toward silence [for] a new generation [and its] disenchanted fathers" (Vail' and Genis 2001,296-7). This era got especially dark for sex and gender dissenters, now punished with greater frequency than before and for whom envisioning an alternative world became a matter of basic survival. For his part, "Kharitonov was tethered double-tight to [. . . this] epoch of Soviet paradise eternally lost" (Mogutin 1993, 11), and his play, unique as it was, proved just as much a product of its time and place. Yet it also marked "the happiest moment in Zhenya's life ... when the curtain</page><page sequence="18">122 Anastasia Kayiatos FIG. 4: From the stage Petukhova and Zhelezova fling queer feeling out to their enchanted audience. went up and the mute actors exited onto the stage to take a bow once, twice, three times" (Kharitonov 2005, 541). Leaning silently in toward their sympathetic audience, the charmed "losers" of mature socialism— as one of my interviewees referred to the Soviet Unions moral deviants and vocal defectives (Aleksandr Samoilov, personal interview, June 8-9, 2010)—turned their backs on an official future that promised no place for them. At the same time, they ensured their silence in official history by cultivating an anachronistic culture of plasticity that the state had already consigned to oblivion. Plastic actors swerved in bold directions away from the party line, in ways that were "harmful" to the status quo, as Orlov the state trainer observed. Under Kharitonov s gentle hand, these enchanted islanders dared to lose equilibrium and go limp in the historical sense. Reorienting, and even disorienting, their bodies in time and space, they embodied hopeful alternatives to their disenchanted present and, in a consummate Utopian gesture, "[reoriented their] affective relation to the future" (Ahmed 2010,162). The sinuous paths these actors traced out of stagnation with their bodies lead me back to the original query I borrowed from the bothered babushka and her hard-line communist comrades at the outset of the essay: What's the use of Enchanted Island? I take the liberty now to tease</page><page sequence="19">Silent Plasticity: Reenchanting Soviet Stagnation 123 out their subtext and ask again: What's the use of an enchanted fairy tale? And, more specifically, a fairy tale about failure brought to life by a bunch of losers? In the same decade that Kharitonov's pantomime enjoyed a long if spotty run at the deaf theater, the field of folkloristics grappled with these questions (all, of course, except the last nasty one). Fairy tales were found to be indispensable tools of normative development, which used enchantment to train a child's unconscious mind how "better able to mas ter life" and "the real world" that peaked out at the storybook's edges (Bet telheim 1977,63). But as one awakens from a dream, so a once-wondrous child grows up into the proper adulthood for which the fairy tale has pre pared him or her. The moral of this story is that enchantment loses out to linear progress narratives, whether subjective or social. But the actors of Enchanted Island are such plastic substance as dreams are made on; they refuse to rouse from their revels if it means growing up straight and not slanting sideways toward each other, or ceasing to dream of magical worlds they might still inhabit, even if holding on to fantasy means losing out to history. Their failed fairy tale elevates losing and lack of mastery to "a queer art of failure," "which quietly loses," even gets lost in its silence, "and in los ing it imagines other goals for life, for love, for art, and for being" (Halber stam 2011, 86). Kharitonov extended such sweet promises to his fellow fantasists of queerer futures, in whose third ears he whispered a dreamy clarion call: "Let us be one and create a new culture of our own; and fall asleep in each other's arms" (2005, 284). Anastasia Kayiatos received her doctorate in Slavic and women's studies from the University of California at Berkeley this summer. Selections from her dissertation on silence in post-Stalin Russia have been published in Theatre Survey (in English), the Journal of Social Policy Studies (in Russian), and Astrolabio (in Spanish). Starting in fall 2012, she will pursue her research on suggestive gesture and queer socialist aes thetics as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Southern California.
